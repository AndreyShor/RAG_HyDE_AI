Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3975WX @ 3.5 GHz processor with 32 cores and 32GB of RAM), and 
IP (Gurobi) run on a cluster node (an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v3 @ 2.50GHz processor 
with 24 cores and 256 GB of RAM). Problem reading time can be significant when the problem 
size is large, but it is excluded from the computational time consideration. We measure the time 
solely taken to solve given problems with classical solvers. In Fig. 1b and Fig. 3, the solution time 
for classical and quantum solvers is presented as a function of problem sizes. Note that a QUBO 
problem is NP-hard49. Evaluating the energy of a given solution has a computational cost of 𝑂(𝑛6), 
where 𝑛 (= problem size) is the number of variables. The number of reads or sweeps does not scale 
with 𝑛, but the cost for each sweep scales as 𝑂(𝑛) for SA. Consequently, the theoretical time 
complexities of the classical solvers are known as 𝑂(𝑛7) for SA50, 𝑂(𝑛6) for SD51, and 𝑂(𝑛6) for 
TS52. On the other hand, the theoretical time complexity of the quantum solvers can be considered 
constant.
