Distributions of selected B0
s →J/ψϕ decays in (top left) m(K+K−e+e−), (top
right) cos θK, (bottom left) cos θe and (bottom right) Φ.
The cos θK, cos θe and Φ distri-
butions are given in the reduced mass window indicated in the top-left figure by the vertical
dashed red lines. The results of the fit with the model described in the text are also shown.
datasets, the analysis is performed in two steps. First, the m(K+K−e+e−) distribution
is fitted to determine the relative contribution of the signal and different background
components. The angular variables are then determined over the reduced m(K+K−e+e−)
range, 5260 < m(K+K−e+e−) < 5380 MeV/c2, taking into account only contributions from
signal, combinatorial background and, for B0
s →ψ(2S)ϕ decays, leakage from B0
s →J/ψϕ
decays. The angular distribution of the combinatorial background is constrained from a
fit to candidates with 5600 < m(K+K−e+e−) < 6800 GeV/c2.
Figures 4 and 5 show the results of the fits to the B0
s →J/ψϕ and B0
s →ψ(2S)ϕ
samples, respectively. The observables ⟨FL⟩and ⟨S3⟩are reinterpreted in terms of the
squared transversity amplitudes |A0|2 and |A⊥|2, correcting for the effect of integration
over decay time. The values of the squared amplitudes are found to be consistent with,
but less precise than, those obtained in the same B0
s decays with J/ψ and ψ(2S)→µ+µ−,
derived from the amplitudes determined in Refs. [43,44], as shown in Fig. 6.

Systematic uncertainties
Sources of systematic uncertainty are considered if they could modify the mass or angular
distribution of the signal or background components in the analysis. The uncertainties
assigned for the different sources are determined using pseudoexperiments. The pseu-
doexperiments are generated with an alternative set of assumptions, with sample size
