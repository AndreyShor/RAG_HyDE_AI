6. Moisture transport and precipitation changes
As discussed in Section 3, the precipitation profile suffers an important structural change when
a superrotating jet is forced at the equator. The goal of this section is to understand how these
changes are related to the circulation changes. Specifically, we will study changes in moisture
transport, which are related to the rates of precipitation P and evaporation E through the water
mass budget over an atmospheric column (between the surface and the top of the atmosphere):
P−E = −∇· [u𝑞]. Because evaporation changes are typical small, the moisture convergence (P−E)
changes are essentially determined by the precipitation changes.
It follows from the water mass budget that the P−E changes associated with a change in 𝐹0 can
be decomposed into a sum of different contributions, as done for example by Seager et al. (2010);
Byrne and O’Gorman (2015) for anthropogenic climate change:
𝛿(P−E) = −∇· [𝛿(u𝑞)] ,
= −∇· [u𝛿(𝑞)]

In Eq. (8), each term on the right hand side corresponds to a different physical process that can
cause a change in P−E:
• 𝛿MTh (which stands for ”Mean Thermodynamic”) contains the contribution due to changes
in the zonally- and time-averaged specific humidity distribution with fixed MMC;
• 𝛿MDyn (which stands for ”Mean Dynamic”) contains the contribution due to changes in the
MMC with fixed mean specific humidity distribution;
• 𝛿Eddy contains the contribution due to changes in transient eddy moisture fluxes;
• 𝛿NL contains the contribution due to non-linear effects associated with correlations between
changes in the MMC and in the mean specific humidity distribution.
As shown in Figure 13, the different components of Eq. (8) behave differently when increasing
the forcing. First of all, we note that both in the fixed- and interactive-SST experiments, two
components of the decomposition are clearly more important than the others: the mean dynamic
