I.
Homology and cohomology groups of platycosms
The classification of line bundles of valence bands over Brillouin platycosm Mα is given by the cohomology group
H2(Mα, Z).
Since Mα is the classifying space of Bα, Hn(Mα, Z) is isomorphic to the group-cohomology group
Hn(Bα, Z),
Hn(Mα, Z) ∼= Hn(Bα, Z).
(S1)
The isomorphism is also held for homology groups, i.e.,
Hn(Mα, Z) ∼= Hn(Bα, Z).
(S2)
From the universal coefficient theorem of cohomology groups, we know
H2(Mα, Z) ∼= T α
1 ⊕F α
2 ,
(S3)
here T α
1 is the torsion component of H1(Bα, Z), and F α
2 is the free Abelian group component Znα of H2(Bα, Z). The
following table lists the first three homology groups and cohomology groups. Results are obtained from GAP.

TABLE S1: he first two columns list the labels and the ten Bieberbach groups, respectively. The next three columns, labeled
H1(Mα), H2(Mα), and H3(Mα), present the first three homology groups of the ten platycosms. The following three columns
display the cohomology groups H1(Mα), H2(Mα), and H3(Mα). The final column provides the explicit presentations of the
corresponding Bieberbach groups.
