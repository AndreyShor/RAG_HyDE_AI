Besides, as emphasized by Howard & Harrison (2013),
‚ÄúCMEs themselves can erupt with an invisible or almost invis-
ible signature in coronagraphs as well‚Äù, because they may be
just the ‚Äúerupting magnetic structures‚Äù and ‚Äútake place without
containing sufficient excess plasma.‚Äù In fact, just this property is
postulated in the formulation of the topological models.
Next, the first geometric feature‚Äînamely, a strongly-curved
trajectory of ejection‚Äîcan answer the question posed, e.g. by
Robbrecht et al. (2009): how can a CME originating on the back
side of Sun have any geoeffective action? The second geometric
feature‚Äîan apparent ‚Äòdetachment‚Äô of the spot of eruption from
the region of magnetic sources, which is realized in about half of
the cases‚Äîcan explain the so-called ‚Äòrandom‚Äô coincidences of
the CMEs with the strong flares in the opposite quadrant of the
solar disk (e.g., Fig. 3(d) in paper Reva et al. 2024).
Finally, let us mention that over a decade ago Oreshina et
al. (2012) already speculated that a formation of CMEs could be
caused by the topological instability (or ‚Äòtopological trigger‚Äô) of
the coronal magnetic fields, but they discussed only the CMEs
associated with solar flares. Unfortunately, it was overlooked
that even a more promising scope of applicability of the topo-
logical models might be just the stealth CMEs.
4. Conclusions
The topological models of magnetic reconnection were sug-
gested over 35 years ago but were repeatedly criticized since
that time for their inability to explain an appreciable heat re-
lease due to the reconnection. However, this disadvantage trans-
forms into the crucial advantage when it is necessary to inter-
pret the stealth coronal mass ejections, occurring without the so-
lar flares. Really, the topological mechanism can easily explain
a global reconstruction of the magnetic field without any heat
release in the vicinity of the null point responsible for the re-
connection. Moreover, the geometrical properties of eruptions
characteristic of the topological models (namely, their strongly
curved trajectories and a ‚Äòdetachment‚Äô of the spot of eruption
from the source region) are also very favorable for explanation
of the stealth CMEs.
At last, it is important to emphasize that the topological mod-
els do not require to introduce any kind of the ‚Äònew physics‚Äô.
In fact, they are based just on the thoroughout analysis of the
specific magnetic-field configurations on the basis of Maxwell
equations, which are even simpler than the standard MHD.

Appendix A: Basic mathematical formalism
Analysis in the framework of GKSS model is usually performed
in two steps: First of all, structure of the magnetic field B is cal-
culated in the magnetostatic approximation:
B = ‚àí‚àáŒ¶ ,
‚àÜŒ¶ = 0 ,
(A.1)
where Œ¶ is the scalar magnetic potential. So, the time enters into
the solution only as a parameter, due to the temporal dependence
of the magnetic sources (which are usually assumed to be located
at the boundary of the volume under consideration, e.g., at the
level of photosphere or somewhat below it). Next, the plasma
motion and the associated processes (heating, emission, etc.) are
analyzed in the given magnetic field.
A key point in the construction of topological model is
searching for the specific ‚Äòtopologically unstable‚Äô arrangement
of the sources, where their small variation results in the emer-
gence of a new null point and its subsequent fast eruption out of
the plane of the sources. As seen in the simulations presented in
Section 2, this process is associated with sharp reconstruction of
the magnetic field in the entire space.
The general mathematical criteria of the topological instabil-
ity were formulated by Gorbachev et al. (1988) as
Ô£±Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≤Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≥
B(r)
r=r‚àó= 0 ,
det

 ‚àÇ2Œ¶‚àÇri‚àÇrj


r=r‚àó= 0 .
(A.2)
In other words, it is necessary to find the arrangement of mag-
netic sources admitting the null points r‚àóin which the Euler‚Äì
Poincar√© topological indices change their signs.
In general, searching for the configurations satisfying equa-
tion (A.2) is a very hard mathematical task. By now, the corre-
sponding analysis was performed only in the approximation of
point-like sources (the effective ‚Äòmagnetic charges‚Äô), when the
magnetic field can be presented as
Œ¶(r) =
4
X
i=1
ei
r
r3 ;
(A.3)
for the additional details, see papers by Gorbachev et al. (1988)
and Somov (2008).
One of the simplest topologically-unstable arrangements,
which was studied analytically in most detail in the previous
works, is the T-type configuration formed by two pairs of sources
of the opposite polarity located in the same plane. Just this ar-
rangement was used in our numerical simulations. To avoid mis-
understanding, let us emphasize that‚Äîfrom the viewpoint of rig-
orous mathematical terminology‚Äîthe most of available crite-
ria for the unstable topological configurations are the sufficient
rather than necessary ones.
