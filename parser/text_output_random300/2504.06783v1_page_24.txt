Extend Data Fig.2 | Observation-convergent variability of estimated GMOCs in coupled reanalyses. a, Time 
series of 12-month running mean GMOC indices in two model historical simulations (CESM-HIS and CM2-HIS) 
and CDA estimates (CESM-CDA and CM2-CDA), as well as the mean of three ocean reanalysis products (denoted 
as ORs). b–d, Time series of meridional mass transport anomalies at 47°, 26°, and 16° N sections in the Atlantic, 
respectively, for the mean of CESM-HIS and CM2-HIS (denoted as HIS), mean of CESM-CDA and CM2-CDA 
(denoted as CDA), ORs, as well as the observations of NOAC (b), RAPID (c), and MOVE (d) arrays. e–f, Time 
series of geostrophic GMOC indices with 5-year mean data (e), and yearly mean data (f), in HIS, CDA, ORs and 
the ocean objective analysis product EN4. g, Variation of anomaly correlation coefficients between the HIS, CDA, 
and ORs geostrophic GMOCs and the EN4 geostrophic GMOC as the timescale changes from low-frequency to 
high-frequency. The mean state correlation coefficient (denoted by ‘mean’) is for spatial pattern correlation of 
temporal mean structure of geostrophic GMOCs. See Methods for the definition of the GMOC index. All correlation 
coefficient statistics for CDA the 95% significance level.
