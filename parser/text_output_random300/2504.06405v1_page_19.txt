Vrms and 500 Hz using the AC power supply at varied durations denoted by the different line colors 
defined in the legend. Aliquots from the reaction were analyzed by 1H NMR and by GPC with a 
polystyrene standard. 
 
Fig. 2: Controllable modulus of the organo-gel to different electric inputs. a, Gelation time as a 
function of AC voltage. b, Storage modulus of gels after electric field application as a function of 
AC voltage intensity (500 Hz, 3 h). c, Storage modulus of gels after electric field application as a 
function of frequency (4 Vrms, 3 h). d, Storage modulus of gels after electric field application as a 
function of reaction time (16 Vrms, 500 Hz).
