(a) Power spectrum of the magnetic field measured with microwave heating turned on
(blue) and off (orange). (b) Van Allen Probe B observation of whistler waves at 17:42:37 UT on
15 July 2016. The white dashed line indicates the electron gyrofrequency fce = 4005 Hz. (c) B-dot
probe measurement from a single shot in EXP-A. The white dashed line indicates fce = 0.84 GHz.
(d) Magnetron power (blue) and X-Ray pulses (red) measured by the detector. (e) B-dot probe
measurement in EXP-B. Whistler waves are generated after the microwave power is turned on and
cease when microwave power is turned off.
2(a) compares shot-averaged results with and without microwave injection, demonstrating
that whistler waves with a peak frequency around 0.63 fce are only excited during microwave
heating. The measured maximum wave amplitude is ∼5 mG. Figure 2(c) presents the
spectrum of a single shot, where the repetitive excitation of whistler waves is clearly observed.
This characteristic is consistently seen in B-dot probe measurements acquired from 3 to
13 ms after the microwave pulse initiation. The repetition period is about ∆trep ∼5 µs,
while microwaves heat electrons to the characteristic temperature me(cfce/fpe)2 = 10 keV
over a time scale of τdrive ∼5 ms, yielding a ratio ∆trep/τdrive = 10−3. Such repetitive wave
generation is reminiscent of whistler-mode chorus waves observed in the magnetosphere, as
illustrated in Figure 2(b). In the magnetosphere, the time scale for electron heating through
adiabatic compression during fast plasma injection is approximately τdrive ∼10 minutes
[37, 38], while whistler-mode chorus waves exhibit repetition periods of ∆trep ∼0.1-1 s [13,
39, 40], yielding ratios of ∆trep/τdrive = 1/600-1/6000. The similar dimensionless repetition
