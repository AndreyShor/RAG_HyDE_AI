Resampling property and independence from the threshold

Since the sets (Sθ,1)θ>0 are disjoint, for all n ∈N, there exists a countable set Λ
c
1,n ⊆Λ such that
for all θ ∈Λ \ Λ
c
1,n, it holds that ν∞,n(Sθ,1) = 0. Indeed, if that were not the case, the measure
ν∞,n would assign positive measure to uncountable many disjoint sets, which is, of course, not
possible. Furthermore, thanks to Lemma 5.5, we know that for each λ ∈Λ ∩(0, n], it holds
that ν∞,λ = ν∞,n|Aλ. In particular, this implies that for all λ, θ ∈Λ \ S
n∈N Λ
c
1,n, it holds that
ν∞,λ(Sθ,1) = 0.
Next, for θ > 0, we introduce the set Sθ,2 ⊆X ⊆X by letting
Sθ,2
def= {(∞, ϕ) ∈X : |{x ∈Rd : ϕ(x) −M(ϕ) = −θ}| > 0}
Consider the mapping Θ : X × Rd →R defined as Θ((b, ϕ), x) = ϕ(x) −M0,b(ϕ). For n ∈N
and a standard multivariate normal random variable N(0, Id), let ν⋆
∞,n be the pushforward of
ν∞,n ⊗N(0, Id) under Θ, which is a measure on R−
0 . We note that there exists a countable set
Λ
c
2,n ⊆Λ such that for all θ ∈Λ \ Λ
c
2,n, it holds that ν⋆
∞,n(θ) = 0. This is due to the fact that
the measure ν⋆
∞,n can only have at most countable many point masses. In turn, this implies that
for all θ ∈Λ \ Λ
c
2,n, it holds that ν∞,n(Sθ,2) = 0. Now, we observe once again that thanks to
Lemma 5.5, for each λ ∈Λ ∩(0, n], it holds that ν∞,λ = ν∞,n|Aλ. Therefore, this implies that for
all λ,θ ∈Λ \ ∪n∈NΛ
c
2,n, it holds that ν∞,λ(Sθ,2) = 0. Finally, combining the previous discussions,
the conclusion follows by setting Λ
def= Λ \ S
n∈N(Λ

2,n).
We conclude this section by proving that the proportionality constant appearing in Definition 2.7 lies
in the interval (0, ∞). Specifically, it suffices to establish the following result.
Lemma 5.6. For all λ ∈Λ, it holds that E[|Dλ(eΥλ)|−1] ∈(0, ∞).
Proof. The fact that E[|Dλ(eΥλ)|−1] > 0 follows immediately from the continuity of the field eΥλ and
from its almost sure decay at infinity, as implied by Lemma 4.20 (see also Remark 4.21). Hence, it
remains to verify that E[|Dλ(eΥλ)|−1] < ∞. To this end, fix 0 < j ≤b. Then, using Lemma 4.22
(see also Remark 4.23) and proceeding exactly as in the proof of Lemma 7.12 below, one obtains that
lim

0,j(Υb)|−1 ∧L)1{M0,b(Υb)≤λ}]
 = 0 .
Since λ ∈Λ, we have that the set of discontinuities of the mapping C(Rd) ∋ϕ 7→|Dλ
0,j(ϕ)|−1 ∧L is
assigned measure zero by the law of the field eΥλ. Therefore, we are in a position to apply Theorems A
and B from which we can deduce that

√
bE[|Dλ
0,j(Υb)|−11{M0,b(Υb)≤λ}] = αc⋆,λE[|Dλ
0,j(eΥλ)|−1] .
By invoking the monotone convergence theorem and Lemma 4.22 (see also Remark 4.23), the claim
follows by taking the limit as j →∞on both sides of the above expression.

A resampling property
In what follows, for x ∈Rd, we recall the definition (2.7) of the shift operator τx. We begin with the
proof of the “resampling property” stated in Proposition 2.9 for the field eΥλ. We will use the notation
introduced in (3.2), (3.3), and (3.4). Furthermore, we recall that Λ ⊆R+ denotes the set introduced
in Lemma 5.1.
Proof of Proposition 2.9. For b ∈N, we recall that Υb = Φb −
√
2dab, where the field Φb is such
that, for all x, y ∈Rd,
E[Φb(x)Φb(y)] = ab(x) + ab(y) −ab(x −y) ,
