To compute topological data for the quotient Y , we will make use of the fact that the Z3-invariant
part of H2(eY , Z) is spanned by e1 + e2 + e3. Under the quotient map q : eY 7→Y , we have that the
pullback of the generator e of H2(Y, Z)Free is
q∗(e) = e1 + e2 + e3.

We then compute the triple intersection number for Y via

The Euler characteristic

Y c3(Y ) and fundamental group π1(Y ) are

π1(Y ) ∼= Z3.
(2.23)
The latter relation holds because eY is simply connected, and the fundamental group of the free
quotient of a simply connected space is the quotient group.
2.2.2.
ζ ≪0-phase
We first look at the branch where σ1 = σ2 = σ3 = 0. The D-term equations
|x|2 −|p|2 = |y|2 −|p|2 = |z|2 −|p|2 = ζ ≪0
(2.24)
imply that the deleted set is
Fζ<0 = {p1 = p2 = p3 = 0}.
(2.25)
Suppose for contradiction that a nonzero value of x, y, z solves the twelve F term equations (2.14).
Then since at least one of the pi is nonzero by (2.25), we get a nonzero solution (x, y, z) to (2.11),
which by assumption could not occur with our choice of Ajkl
i
. Therefore the classical vacuum in
the ζ ≪0 phase has xi = yi = zi = 0 for all i. Now the D-term equations (2.24) can be seen to
imply |p|2 = −ζ
It remains to mod out by the gauge symmetry. The vacuum is then given5 by
{ pi ∈C3 | |p|2 = −ζ }/( pi ∼(λ1λ2λ3)−1pi ).
(2.26)
Topologically, the vacuum manifold (2.26) is a P2. The symmetry is broken to (U(1) × U(1)) ⋊Z3
where the elements of the U(1)3-part of the gauge group reduce to
(λ1, λ2, λ3) →(λ1, λ2, (λ1λ2)−1),
(2.27)
5Alternatively, we can write this as a GIT quotient {pi ∈C3 −{0}}/C∗which produces the same topological
space. However, since we will soon discuss the subtleties of both discrete and continuous unbroken symmetries, we
proceed with (2.26).
