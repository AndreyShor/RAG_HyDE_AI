are not satisﬁed seem to be artiﬁcial mathematical constructs
rather than real physical examples. Similar issues arise when
dealing with (impedance) passivity, see Remark 3.
Remark 2: Systems of the form (13) with B = C∗are
known as collocated systems [15, p.266]. The name reﬂects
the practice of applying control and observation actions at
the same point in distributed parameter systems. We refer
to a collocated system of the form (13) with A = A∗as
internally symmetric. If, in addition, A ≤0, then A is the
inﬁnitesimal generator of a contraction semigroup, see [15,
Section 2.3] for details. The latter is a mild form of stability
which is implied by, e.g., exponential stability. Therefore,
internal relaxation in LTSI systems is a combination of
internal symmetry and stability, just like internal relaxation
in LTI systems [6], [14].
V. IMPEDANCE PASSIVITY AND RELAXATION
In this section, we will show that LTSI systems that are
internally of relaxation type are impedance passive with
energy storage that can be determined from their input-
output behaviour, thus extending the analogous result on LTI
relaxation systems [6]. In doing so, we will also characterize
impedance passivity for LTSI systems, namely, we will show
that it can be veriﬁed pointwise, just like (internal) relaxation.
To begin with, impedance passivity is the analogue of pas-
sivity for inﬁnite-dimensional systems, see [15, Section 7.5]
for details. It is deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 3: The LTSI system Σ is impedance passive if
U = Y and there exists a storage functional S : Z →R+,
given by S(z) = ⟨Qz, z⟩with Q ∈B(Z), Q ≥0, such that
S(z(t)) ≤S(z(0)) +
Z t
0
⟨u(τ), y(τ)⟩+ ⟨y(τ), u(τ)⟩dt
for all z(0) ∈Z, t ≥0, and u ∈L2([0, τ], U).
Impedance passivity of inﬁnite-dimensional systems has
a similar characterization as passivity of ﬁnite-dimensional
systems, namely, it can be expressed as the solvability of a
linear operator inequality.
Lemma 1: The LTSI system Σ is impedance passive if
and only if there exists Q ∈B(Z), Q ≥0, such that
C = B∗Q,
⟨Az, Qz⟩+ ⟨Qz, Az⟩≤0
(20)
for all z ∈D(A).
Proof: See [15, Lemma 7.5.2].
Just like (internal) relaxation, impedance passivity of LTSI
systems can be veriﬁed pointwise. This is shown in the
following theorem.
Theorem 3: The LTSI system Σ is impedance passive if
and only if there exist ˆQω ∈Cn×n, ˆQω ≥0, ω ∈Rs, such
that
ˆCω = ˆB∗
ω ˆQω, ,
ˆA∗
ω ˆQω + ˆQω ˆAω ≤0,
(21)
for all ω ∈Rs, and supω∈Rs∥ˆQω∥< ∞.
Proof: This proof is similar to the proof of [16, Theo-
rem 2]. The idea is that the condition supω∈Rs∥ˆQω∥< ∞is
equivalent to the boundedness of the multiplication operator
with symbol ˆQ, which we denote by ˆQ ∈B(Z). We start
by proving sufﬁciency. Since ˆQω ≥0 and (21) hold for all
ω ∈Rs, it follows that ˆQ ≥0 and
ˆC = ˆB∗ˆQ,
⟨ˆ
Aˆz, ˆQˆz⟩+ ⟨ˆQˆz, ˆ
Aˆz⟩≤0
(22)
for all ˆz ∈D( ˆ
A). Recall that the Fourier transform is unitary.
This implies that Q = F∗ˆQF ∈B(Z), satisﬁes Q ≥0 and
the conditions of Lemma 1, hence Σ is impedance passive.
For the proof of necessity, suppose that Σ is impedance
passive. Since the dynamics of Σ are translation-invariant, the
storage is translation-invariant, i.e., there exists translation-
invariant Q ∈B(Z), Q ≥0, that satisﬁes the conditions
of Lemma 1. This implies that ˆQ = FQF∗∈B(Z) is a
multiplication operator that satisﬁes ˆQ ≥0 and (22). Finally,
the symbol ˆQ of ˆQ is such that supω∈Rs∥ˆQω∥< ∞because
ˆQ ∈B(Z), ˆQω ≥0 for all ω ∈Rs because ˆQ ≥0, and
(21) holds for all ω ∈Rs because (22) holds.
In [6], it is shown that LTI relaxation systems are passive
with a unique1 compatible storage function that can be
determined from their input-output behaviour. Deriving the
analogue of this result for LTSI relaxation systems presents
some minor technical challenges, see Remark 3. We cir-
cumvent these by instead considering LTSI systems that are
internally of relaxation type. In particular, we obtain the
following theorem.
Theorem 4: If the LTSI system Σ is internally of re-
laxation type, then it is impedance passive with storage
S : Z →R+ given by S(z) = ∥z∥2. Furthermore,
S(z(0)) =
Z ∞
0
⟨u(−t), y(t)⟩dt
(23)
where z : R →Z and y : R →Y are the state and output
trajectories corresponding to the input trajectory u : R →U
such that u(t) = 0 for t ≥0.
Proof: Since Σ is internally of relaxation type, we
have that A ≤0 and B = C∗. Let Q ∈B(Z) be the
identity operator and note that Q ≥0 and S(z) = ⟨Qz, z⟩.
Furthermore, (20) holds for all z ∈Z, hence Σ is impedance
passive due to Lemma 1. Now, consider an input trajectory
u : R →U such that u(t) = 0 for t ≥0. Let z : R →Z
and y : R →Y be the resulting state and output trajectories.
Consider the Fourier transforms ˆu, ˆz and ˆy of u, z and y,
respectively. Note that ˆzω and ˆyω are the state and output
trajectories of ˆΣω corresponding to the input trajectory ˆuω,
which is such that ˆuω(t) = 0 for t ≥0. Due to Theorem 2,
ˆΣω is internally of relaxation type for all ω ∈Rs and, thus,
ˆAω ≤0 and ˆBω = ˆC∗
ω. As shown in [6, Theorem 9], see
also [6, Remark 8], this implies that
∥ˆzω(0)∥2 =
Z ∞
0
⟨ˆuω(−t), ˆyω(t)⟩dt
(24)
Since the Fourier transform is unitary, it follows that
∥z(0)∥2
Z = ∥ˆz(0)∥2
Z =
