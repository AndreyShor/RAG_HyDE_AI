sition pressure pt, and the energy density at which the
phase transition begins εt, for different values of the
constituent quark mass m.
Table 1 Transition data for slow-stable configurations of HS
using the D3-D7/NL3* model. The input is the constituent
quark mass m. The following quantities are listed: εt indicates
the density energy of the hadronic part where the phase tran-
sition starts, pt is the corresponding transition pressure and
∆εt is the energy gap between the two phases. ∆εt, εt and pt
are given in MeV/fm3.

In Fig. 1 we display the plot regarding the equa-
tions of state, with hadron-quark phase transition im-
plemented, for different parameterizations of the holo-
graphic D3-D7 model. This graph illustrates the effect
of increasing the constituent quark mass on the tran-
sition pressure and the energy density gap. In particu-
lar, both quantities increase as long as the constituent
quark mass grows. In Fig. 2 we present the speed of
sound v2
s = ∂p/∂ε as a function of the energy density
ε. It is an indicator if causality is fulfilled, i.e. v2
s < 1.
For the range of parameters of Fig. 2, the present holo-
graphic hybrid model satisfies the causality criterion,
explicitly showing that the speed of sound is higher in
the hadronic phase.
The hydrostatic equilibrium for a spherically sym-
metric object is ensured by solving the TOV equations,

where p(r) and ε(r) are the pressure and energy density
profiles of the star, respectively, in terms of the radial

black curve is the NL3* hadronic model. The different val-

the holographic model are the following: m = 300 MeV (or-

In this work, to analyze the stability of HS we solve
the equations of radial oscillations. This analysis fo-
cuses on determining whether radial oscillations can
