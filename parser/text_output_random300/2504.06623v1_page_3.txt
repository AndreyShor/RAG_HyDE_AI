Bose gas model, we need to have a single particle quan-
tum spectrum whose density of states ρ(ϵ) grows also as
ρ(ϵ) ∼exp[C0 ϵ2] for large ϵ.
The quantum potential that leads to ρ(ϵ) ∼eC0 ϵ2: As
a warm up, let us first discuss two well known simple
examples: (i) a d-dimensional harmonic oscillator with
V (r) = r2 and (ii) a d-dimensional box of size Ld. In
case (i), the single particle energies are given by ϵ =
Pd
j mj (up to a constant and in suitable units) where
mj = 0, 1, 2 . . . are the quantum numbers. Consequently,

(14)
leading to the well known density of states for a d-
dimensional harmonic oscillator
ρ(ϵ) ∼ϵd−1
as
ϵ →∞.
(15)
The example (ii), i.e., the d-dimensional box can be
solved in a similar way by noting that in this case
ϵ = Pd
j=1 m2
j (in suitable units where L = 1).
Pro-
ceeding as in case (i), it is easy to show that for the
d-dimensional box
ρ(ϵ) ∼ϵd/2−1
as
ϵ →∞.
(16)
In both examples, ρ(ϵ) grows algebraically for large ϵ.
To estimate ρ(ϵ) for a general confining central poten-
tial V (r) in d dimensions, we can use the semi-classical
Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization formula which gives an
accurate estimate for large ϵ.
To make this estimate,
it is convenient to work with the cumulative density of
states up to level ϵ, i.e., N(ϵ) =
R ϵ
0 ρ(ϵ′) dϵ′. Then the
integrated density of states scales as N(ϵ) ∼[n(ϵ)]d in
d-dimensions, where n(ϵ) is the quantum number (ra-
dial) associated to the energy level ϵ. The latter can be
estimated from the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule
(again in appropriate units)

ϵ −V (r) dr ≈n(ϵ) ∼[N(ϵ)]1/d .

It is easy to check that this general result reproduces
correctly the exact estimate in Eq. (15) for the harmonic
oscillator case V (r) = r2, as well as the result in Eq.
(16 ) for the box case where V (r) = 0. Now, we want
ρ(ϵ) ∼eC0 ϵ2. This means, up to pre-exponential factors,
N(ϵ) ∼eC0ϵ2. Substituting this on the right hand side
(rhs) of Eq. (17) gives for large ϵ

ϵ −V (r) dr ≈eC0 ϵ2/d .

A little inspection shows that a potential V (r) that re-
produces the rhs of (18) is of the form
V (r) ∼B
√
ln r
as
r →∞,
(19)
where the prefactor B can be determined as follows. We
substitute this ansatz on the left hand side of (18) and
make a change of variable B
√
ln r = ϵ y. Consequently
the left hand side (lhs) of (18) reads
Z eϵ2/B2

ϵ −V (r) dr = 2 ϵ5/2

For large ϵ, the dominant contribution to the integral
over y comes from the vicinity of y = 1 and one can
easily show that up to inconsequential factors
Z eϵ2/B2
0
p
ϵ −V (r) dr ≈eϵ2/B2
as
ϵ →∞.
(21)
Comparing it to the rhs of (18) fixes the prefactor B =

d/C0 uniquely. Hence, the required potential to pro-
duce Ω(E) ∼eC0 E2 for large E is given by
V (r) ≈

Eigenfunctions in a potential α
p
ln |x|: The potential
in Eq. (22) grows extremely slowly with distance from
the origin. It may be questioned if a potential increas-
ing as slowly as the square root of the logarithm is even
confining and hence has discrete eigenvalues. In other
words, are the eigenfunctions sufficiently localised and
square integrable? We now show that they are indeed
localised and for simplicity, we just show this in d = 1.
Generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward.
We then consider a single quantum particle in one di-
mension in a potential V (x) = α
p
ln |x| with α > 0. The
eigenfunction ψϵ(x) associated to an eigenvalue ϵ satisfy
the Schr¨odinger equation

(23)
where V (x) = α

ln |x|. According to the WKB approx-
imation, a good estimate of the symmetric wave function
for x > 0 can be expressed as

where C+ is a constant.
The real line is thus divided
into a ”classically allowed” region where V (x) < ϵ, and a
”classically forbidden” region where V (x) > ϵ. The two
regions are separated by the ”turning point” xc given by
ϵ = α
p
ln |xc|, i.e.,
xc = exp(ϵ2/α2) .
