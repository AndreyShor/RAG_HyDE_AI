Fig. 12. UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum of 2-AmpH2PO3 single crystal plate.  
 
Fig. 13. Principal refractive indices and their dispersion of 2-AmpH2PO3, together with fitted 
Sellmeier curves. Markers represent measured (and corrected) refractive index data, lines give 
the Sellmeier fits.

AmpH2PO3 (showing thus angle 2V = 180° - 2V), taken with a polarizing microscope with 
crossed polarizers in conoscopic illumination and linearly polarized white light. The 
pronounced dispersion of the angle 2V (and 2V) becomes evident from the marked colour 
fringes. (b) Wavelength dependence of the orientation angle  between the principal axis of the
