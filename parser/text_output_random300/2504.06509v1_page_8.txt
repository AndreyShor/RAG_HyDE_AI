Since the MTJ resistance is significantly higher than 50 Ω, the actual pulse amplitude at the 
MTJ was approximately doubled, following: Γ(R)=2Z0/(Z0+R), where R=50 Ω and Z0 is 
dominated by the MTJ impedance, which is much higher than 50 Ω. Fig. 3(b) illustrates the 
testing sequence. Initially, a 1 mT magnetic field sets the MTJ to the AP state. The field is then 
adjusted within the bistable region, and a voltage pulse with varying width/amplitude is applied. 
Post-pulse resistance is measured to determine switching. Each probability data point in Fig. 
3(d) is averaged over 200 trials. Fig. 3(c) presents the minor loop of a 150 nm device. A device 
with relatively larger coercivity is selected to investigate the effect of an applied magnetic field 
on switching. Magnetic fields ranging from 40 to 48 mT, within the bipolar state region, are 
chosen. The voltage amplitude remains fixed at 3.56 V, while the pulse width is gradually 
increased from 0.5 ns until the switching probability reaches approximately 0.95. The sigmoid-
fit results in Fig. 3(d) indicate that a magnetic field near the AP-to-P threshold accelerates 
switching, attributed to a reduced effective energy barrier. The observed switching stems from 
a combination of the external field, VCMA, and potentially VCEC. In a device governed solely 
by the VCMA effect, the minor loop contracts toward the center under a positive voltage, AP-
to-P switching occurs only if the external field exceeds the loop center field. If the external 
field is below this threshold, switching is suppressed, as the field favors the AP state. However, 
the observed switching at 40 and 42 mT suggests the presence of an additional effect that 
counteracts the external field and facilitates switching. These findings confirm the persistence 
of the VCEC effect on the nanosecond timescale, eliminating the slower VCEC mechanism 
associated with ion drifting in our stack. This highlights VCEC's potential as a viable 
replacement for STT, even in the GHz regime. 
Voltage dependent switching speed and its size dependency 
 
 
FIG. 4 | Fast switching results under different applied voltages. (a) Switching probability as a function of pulse width 
under different applied voltages. As the voltage increases from 2.00 V to 8.93 V, the switching probability increases with 
pulse width. (b) Voltage and pulse width corresponding to the 50% switching probability points. The pulse width is inversely 
proportional to the applied voltage as is fitted by the equation inset. (c) Fitted parameters A/B across various device sizes. 
Since A/B is inversely proportional to the effective damping constant in the single-domain model, we conclude that the 
effective damping increases as the MTJ size decreases.
