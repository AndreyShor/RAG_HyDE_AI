lations, but mainly driven by two SNe and possibly due to the
relatively low statistics.
Given the correlation found between MY and p0, we tested
the standardization of the Y-band light-curves, finding a reduc-
tion in σint of 0.04 mag when correcting the Y-band luminosity.
Future research will investigate whether applying corrections at
these wavelengths offers a genuine advantage, given the need
for good photometric coverage, compared to using a single NIR
epoch (Stanishev et al. 2018; Müller-Bravo et al. 2022a), which
benefits from increasing the statistical sample size of SNe Ia. The
Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time
(Ivezi´c et al. 2019) will provide y-band photometry for SNe,
which can be used as a test set.
NIR observations of SNe Ia provide a unique opportunity to
study the physics of these transients and for doing cosmology.
Although the number of objects observed in the NIR has been
steadily increasing in the last decade, there is still a very lim-
ited number of these with high-cadence observations covering
both NIR peaks. Surveys like CSP present unique datasets to
study these transients in detail given the rich photometric and
spectroscopic coverage. Photometry from new low- and high-
redshift surveys, such as the Aarhus-Barcelona FLOWS project8,
Hawai’i Supernova Flows (Do et al. 2024) and JADES (De-
Coursey et al. 2024), will further increase the numbers, and will
be essential for making the most of future observations from Eu-
clid and the Roman Space Telescope.
Finally, we would like to encourage the community to pro-
duce new and more sophisticated theoretical models of SNe Ia
extending to NIR wavelengths to compare against the increas-
ing amount of data, helping constrain their physics and improve
their usefulness as cosmological distance indicators.
