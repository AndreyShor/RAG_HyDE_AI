where bg is a finite bit-precision for the Gramian elements, but note that the cost can be reduced given
information about the lattice geometry. For the sake of readability, let n2
1+n2
2+n2
3 = ˜n and n1+n2+n3 = n.
Then the leading order cost for the computation of |ϕV
q ⟩is
5˜n + 4n2 + 8bgn,
(184)
and for the uncomputation

2 ˜n + 2n2 + 4bgn.

Assuming that the number of bits to encode momenta is large relative to the bit precision with which
we carry out arithmetic, the overwhelming cost to the ancilla count are the ˜n qubits necessary to en-
code |kq|2.
Likewise for the pseudoion term, the subroutine PREPcoul,ion prepares the state |ϕV

Ω|kQ|2 |Q⟩. This preparation proceeds identically as above, but now we span over ¯G0
trunc mo-
menta. In general, this quantity will be small given the ion-ion cutoff. However, we make the conservative
assumption that there is no truncation and we must prepare a state over all momenta in ¯G0. In this case,
we have the same cost as the electronic case but with n replaced with ¯n and ˜n replaced with ˜¯n to account
for the increased number of plane waves spanning the ion momentum register.

SELcoul,el, SELcoul,ion
The SELECT for the electronic Coulomb term is given by
SELcoul,el =
X
q∈G0
X
c∈{0,1}
|q, c⟩⟨q, c| ⊗U coul, el
(q,c)
(186)
U coul,el
(q,c)
=
X
p,p′∈G
(−1)c([p−q/∈G]∨[p′+q/∈G])|p −q⟩⟨p| ⊗|p′ + q⟩⟨p′|.
(187)
The construction is identical to that in Ref. [91], Sec II D (except we iterate over the composite index ¯I),
and so we describe it only briefly. The addition of the transferred momentum q is complicated by the fact that
the momenta are not encoded in two’s complement, but in a signed representation. Conversion, addition and
back-conversion costs 8n Toffolis (Ref. [91], Eq. (94)). Checking whether the added/subtracted momenta
p −q and p′ + q are in G is not strictly necessary, given that this branch flips high bits in these registers
to 1 if outside the prerequisite range, and we can select on |0⟩for these bits, implying that that branch lies
outside the block encoding. However, if the checking is explicitly included then it adds an additional four
Toffolis (one each to check p −q and p′ + q, one to OR them, and one to AND them with the bit c). We
do not include the additional Toffolis in the resource count in the main body. As for ancilla qubits, maxi ni
qubits are needed for the arithmetic and four are needed for the checking.
The SELECT for the ion-ion term is almost identical:
SELcoul,ion =
X
Q∈¯
G0
trunc
X
c∈{0,1}
|Q, c⟩⟨Q, c| ⊗U coul, ion
(Q,c)
(188)
U coul,ion
(Q,c)
=
X
P,P′∈¯
Gtrunc
(−1)c([P−Q/∈¯
Gtrunc]∨[P′+Q/∈¯
Gtrunc])|P −Q⟩⟨P| ⊗|P′ + Q⟩⟨P′|.
(189)
It therefore incurs an equivalent cost, but with n replaced by ¯n to account for the larger registers needed to
store the pseudoion momenta.
