Figure 2: Ledoux discriminant proﬁle and the thermal components for two evolutionary
solar models. The dark blue solid line is associated with a standard solar model (Model 7) while
the red plain line is for a model including macroscopic transport of chemicals at the BCZ (Model
9). The thermal component of the Ledoux discriminant for both models is plotted as light blue
and orange dashed lines for the standard and non-standard evolutionary models respectively.
The difference between the dashed and the plain line is, by deﬁnition, the contribution of the
mean molecular weight term. Source Data provided with this paper.
