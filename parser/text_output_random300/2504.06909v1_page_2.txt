ABSTRACT: While it is expected that the large-scale tropical circulation should undergo some
changes in a warmer climate, it remains an open question whether its characteristic features,
such as the Hadley cell, the intertropical convergence zone, or the weak surface easterlies, could
take a completely different shape.
As an example, it has been hypothesized that the Earth’s
atmosphere may have experienced equatorial superrotation – i.e. westerly winds at the equator
– during its history.
The possibility of equatorial superrotation has been studied in a range
of planetary atmospheres, including Earth-like ones, with the objective of understanding the
underlying dynamical processes.
However, the broader impact that this dramatic circulation
change would have on the climate system is practically unexplored. This is the question we address
here. We perform idealized GCM simulations with an imposed equatorial torque to investigate
how a forced superrotating atmosphere affects surface temperature and the water cycle. We show
that these effects are quite large and directly related to the global circulation changes, which extend
beyond the tropical atmosphere. Using tools including a forcing/feedback analysis and a moist
energy balance model, we argue that the dominant mechanism is changes in atmospheric energy
transport, driven in particular by the collapse of the meridional overturning circulation, and to
a smaller extent by the appearance of an equatorial jet, and the concomitant redistribution of
moisture in the tropics, leading to a much weaker relative humidity gradient which has strong
radiative effects.
