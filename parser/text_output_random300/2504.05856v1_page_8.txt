Fig. 4: Comparison of the first (p0; top row) and second (p1; bottom row) PCA coefficients vs. the peak absolute magnitude for each
NIR band. The Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ) and p-value for each of the comparisons, with their respective 1σ uncertainty
estimated by Monte-Carlo sampling, are shown with the respective linear relations (red lines). The null-hypothesis is that there is
no correlation (zero slope). The panels have the same x- and y-axis ranges for visualisation purposes.
SNe Ia. Note, however, that the host-galaxy mass, although eas-
ier to estimate than other host properties, may not necessarily
capture adequately the effect the environment has on SNe Ia NIR
light curves.
The relation between host-galaxy color excess, E(B −V)host
(obtained with SNooPy using the EBV_model2), and the first two
PCA components is studied as well. As with log10(M/M⊙), we
do not find any clear correlation. Assuming that dustier galaxies
are expected to be more metal-rich (i.e. more metal-rich progen-
itors), some correlation would be expected given our analysis in
Sect. 6.2, but a more precise estimation of metallicity would be
needed to draw any strong conclusions. Future work will extend
on using other galaxy properties, such as star formation rate and
metallicity, to further study the impact of the environment on the
secondary NIR peak of SNe Ia.
6.5. NIR color-curves decomposition
Following the PCA decomposition of the NIR light curves of
SNe Ia, we study the decomposition of the rest-frame, K- and
MW-corrected, NIR color curves: (Y −J), (Y −H), and (J −H).
The same criteria applied in Sect. 5.1 were applied here, except
for the normalisation in the y-axis. The color curves are shown
in Fig. 8. Note that the number of SNe Ia used in this case is re-
duced compared to those in Sect. 5 due to the requirements of
having two bands with proper coverage instead of one. Inspec-
tion of Fig. 8 reveals that the (Y −J) and (J−H) color curves fol-
low a very similar evolution to those shown by Lu et al. (2023),
where there is a clear separation between SNe Ia with high and
low sBV. This means that SNe Ia that are optically-bluer around
optical maximum have on average redder NIR colors around the
time of secondary NIR peak. However, the NIR color as a func-
tion of sBV does not present a monotonic transition as smooth as
is seen in Lu et al. (2023).
The color-curves decomposition is presented in Fig. 9. It can
be noted that the first component (C0) captures over 50% of
the variance for all color curves, while relatively low variance
is captured by the other components. Additionally, it can be seen
that NIR color curves present relatively high intrinsic uniformity
around optical peak, also shown in Fig. 8.
The C0 components mainly capture how blue or red the NIR
color curves are, with some phase dependence, where SNe with
larger sBV reach their reddest color, on average, at later epochs. It
can also be seen that the NIR color curves of SNe Ia show some
similarity in evolution with the (B −V) curve, but reach their
reddest point at much earlier phases: around 5 days for (Y −J),
12 days for (Y −H), and 18 days for (J −H). In other words, p0
could be linked to an sBV-like parameter in the NIR and trace
similar information. For instance, the peak in the (J −H) curve
approximately coincides with the local minimum on the J band
(see Figs. 3 and 9), possibly tracing the onset of the recombina-
tion of iron-group elements.
When comparing the PCA components against NIR peak ab-
solute magnitude, we see no clear correlations, except for the
(Y −H) C1 components. However, the variance explained by
this component is relatively low (∼14%), so it does not carry
much information. This lack of correlation is not surprising as
similar results were found in general for the decomposition in
Sect. 6.3.1.
