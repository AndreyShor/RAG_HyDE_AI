Introduction
The inflationary phase constitutes the most important phase of the primordial Universe.
It solves the conceptual challenges of the classical Big Bang Theory and provides a mech-
anism for generating the primordial density fluctuations observed in the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). These fluctuations act as seeds for many phenomena, including pri-
mordial black holes (PBH) [1–4] and gravitational waves (GWs) [5–14], in posterior eras.
The specific nature of each era (matter or radiation-dominated) influences the dynamics
of these phenomena, providing insights into early universe physics.
Almost every inflationary model, especially single-field models, exhibits a phase known
as preheating [15, 16], just after the end of inflation.
During this stage, the universe
undergoes a transient matter-dominated period driven by the oscillations of the inflaton
field at the bottom of the inflationary potential. PBH are usually considered to form from
the collapse of amplified density perturbations generated during inflation as they enter
the horizon.
Conventionally, PBH formation has been studied in radiation-dominated
eras, where the radiation pressure allows the definition of a collapse threshold for the
perturbations [17–19], and the mass fraction of PBH is often estimated using the Press-
Schechter formalism [18, 20]. In contrast, during this preheating stage, characterized by
negligible pressure, the collapse dynamics differ significantly. Here, non-spherical effects
