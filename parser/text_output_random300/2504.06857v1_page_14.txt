FIG. 10: Ratios of the unfolded CC0π differential cross sections as a function of the muon kinematics (pµ, cos θµ),
compared against the true cross sections used to generate the data. Each plot contains the ratios from a specified
range of the forward angle cos θµ. Error bars are the spread in results from 500 pseudo-experiments varying
systematic and statistical uncertainties, while the nominal result for each bin is the mean of those 500 unfolded
throws. Note that the highest momentum bin in each case extends up to 30 GeV, but is truncated in the plots for
readability.
