for some K > 0 independent of δ. From this it follows that if δ was small enough, it must be
v∗= f.
(Otherwise one may divide by |v∗−f| to arrive at a contradiction.) Thus, we have shown that
when |f −f0| = δ with δ sufficiently small, any fixed point v∗of F with |v∗−f0| < δ must coincide
with the the function f that we wanted to recover.
We next argue that the iteration defined by
vj+1 := F[vj],
v0 = f0
(5.9)
converges to a unique fixed point of F satisfying |v∗−f0| < δ provided that δ was small enough.
Thus, by what we argued above, the iteration will then converge to v∗= f. Note that if v1, v2 are
two functions with |v1 −f0|, |v1 −f0| < δ, we can take the expansion (5.7) with v1 and v2 in place
of v∗and f respectively then hit both sides of the equation with (DA |f=f0)−1 to get
F[v1] −F[v2] = DF |f=v2 (v1 −v2) + O(|v1 −v2|2),
where the implied constant in the O-notation is bounded due to |v1 −v2| ≤2δ. Note that
DF |v2= (DA |f=f0)−1 (DA |f=f0 −DA |v2) ,
which implies that
DF |v2 (v1 −v2) = O(|v1 −v2||f0 −v2|).
Consequently, if δ was small enough (forcing |f0 −v2| and |v1 −v2| to be small), the operator F is
a contraction in the sense that
|F[v1] −F[v2]| ≤C|v1 −v2|
(5.10)
for some constant C < 1 independent of δ.
By the contraction property (5.10), we have
|vj+1 −vj| = |F[vj] −F[vj−1]| ≤C|vj −vj−1|.
Iterating this estimate gives
|vj+1 −vj| ≤Cj|v1 −f0|.
Consequently, for any m > l, we have by the triangle inequality:
|vm −vl| ≤
m−1
X
k=l
|vk+1 −vk| ≤|v1 −f0|
m−1
X
k=l
Ck.
Summing the geometric series on the right gives
|vm −vl| ≤
Cl
1 −C |v1 −f0|.
Since C < 1, we thus have demonstrated the iteration vj+1 = F[vj] converges to a fixed point.
Moreover, the convergence is geometrical. We also remark that the fixed point is unique and at
a distance less than δ from f0, which follow directly from the fact that F was a contraction. In
summary
lim
j→∞vj = v∗= f.
(5.11)
The presentation here is, of course, not mathematically rigorous. We have not specified which
norm ∥·∥we are using on function spaces and whether the operators A, DA|f=v∗and (DA |f=f0)−1
etc. behave well on these function spaces. A rigorous mathematical study of the limiting behaviour
of the iterative procedure (5.9) is beyond the scope of this current article. We remark that analogous
and mathematically precise arguments appear for example in [53].
