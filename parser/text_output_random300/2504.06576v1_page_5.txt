It is evident that this solution inherently fulfills the boundary condition for normal velocity.
However, to determine the value of 𝑐𝑏, it is necessary to apply the boundary condition for
tangential velocity (non-slip). It is important to note that the current analytical solution is only
valid for a short-time approximation (Sun 2024). The accuracy of the solution significantly
improves with an increase in the strength of the magnetic field.

This derivative of 𝑓demonstrates that the boundary layer flow velocity, when subjected to
an external magnetic field, retains a structure in which shock wave-like (tanh 𝜉) and solitary
wave-like (1/cosh2 𝜉) coexist. The Lorentz force plays a significant role in increasing their
amplitude, frequency and wavenumber.
3.2. Linear Solution under Strong Magnetic Field
Under extreme physical conditions, the Lorentz force will excite new function forms in
the boundary layer flow structure. If the similarity coefficient is quite small and the Stuart
number is sufficiently large, the nonlinear terms in the momentum equation can be ignored.
Under these extreme conditions, the momentum equation simplifies to a linear equation

Let function ( 𝑓−𝜂+ 𝐶) be extended to 𝐹in the complex field. The method of separation
of space and time variables can be applied to the derivation of an analytical solution to
this equation. The variable 𝑔𝑛represents the spatial function and 𝑇𝑛represents the temporal
