Next, considering the ﬁrst equation, decomposing the Poisson bracket, we
obtain:
Kb
(τ)∂bf + Kb
Σ1∂bf + Kb
Σ2∂bf = 0,
(3.33)
where the coeﬃcients of ∂bf are constructed from the following diﬀerential ex-
pressions involving the gauge parameters:
Kb
(τ) ≡ǫab∂a∂σ3τ(Q1, Q2),
(3.34)
Kb
Σ1 ≡∂σ3Q1ǫab∂a∂σ3Q2 −Q2ǫab∂a∂2
σ3Q1,
(3.35)
Kb
Σ2 ≡Q1ǫab∂a∂2
σ3Q2 −∂σ3Q2ǫab∂a∂σ3Q1.
(3.36)
Since the diﬀerentiation patterns in each term are distinct, they can be consid-
ered formally independent. Thus, we conclude:
{∂σ3τ(Q1, Q2), f} = 0,
(3.37)
Σ(∂σ3Q1, Q2; f) = 0,
(3.38)
Σ(Q1, ∂σ3Q2; f) = 0.
(3.39)
These conditions provide the necessary constraints to preserve the composition
rule of the transformations even after the volume-preserving deformation is re-
stricted.
See Appendix B for a more mathematical discussion of the necessary and
suﬃcient conditions for the restriction of gauge parameters from gauge con-
straints.

Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformation (RVPD)
With the restrictions on Q1 and Q2 established in the previous section, we
denote the restricted parameters as Q(R)
1
and Q(R)
2
. Under these restrictions,
the Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformation (RVPD) can be expressed as:
δRX = {Q(R)
1
, Q(R)
2
, XI} = {τ(Q(R)
1
, Q(R)
2
), XI}.
(4.1)
This formulation demonstrates that the deformation can be fully described using
only the term τ(Q(R)
1
, Q(R)
2
). As a result, the original complexity of the Nambu
bracket is signiﬁcantly reduced, while the transformation continues to main-
tain the desired properties, such as the composition rule, under the restricted
conditions.
Under this gauge-ﬁxing condition, the action can be written as:
