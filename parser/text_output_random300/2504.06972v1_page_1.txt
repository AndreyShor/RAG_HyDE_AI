Abstract: 
Two-dimensional moiré systems provide an exceptional platform for exploring novel 
quantum phenomena driven by electronic correlations and non-trivial band topology. 
A notable example is the recent observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall 
(FQAH) effect in moiré Chern bands [1-11]. It opens new avenues for further exploring 
a variety of many-body electronic liquid and solid phases at zero magnetic field within 
a lattice system. Even more intriguing is the possibility that flat Chern bands can, in 
principle, also support exotic superconducting phases [12-18], which are unlikely to
