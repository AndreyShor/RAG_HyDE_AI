FIG. 1. Frequency dependence of the generalized Landau parameter in the ℓ= 0 angular-momentum component of F(θ, Ω) [cf.
Eq. (25)], after resolving it into the real and imaginary parts.
In our earlier work [36], we studied Eq. (24) in the collisionless limit such that the the imaginary part of the GLF, F I,
was ignored. Since F I causes the damping of the collective modes, there we assumed that the decaying parts of the modes
are negligible. But here, we explicitly include the effects of F I, at the same footing as F R, to quantitatively estimate if it
can genuinely be ignored or whether it destabilizes the lifetime of the collective modes. In order to make the calculation
analytically tractable, we decompose F(θ, Ω) into angular-momentum channels, indexed by ℓ∈0 ∪Z+.
The most singular correction is obtained from the ℓ= 0 component, which is defined as
F0(Ω) =
Z 2 π

In Fig. 1 we illustrate the frequency dependence of F R
0 ≡Re[F0] and F I
0 ≡Im[F0] via the function a = ¯Ωα. In the low-
frequency limit of ¯Ωα ≪1, both F R
0 and F I
0 are of the same order and behave in a qualitatively similar way. Explicitly,
their forms are F R

Let us first discuss our conclusions reported in our earlier work, viz. Ref. [36]. When s is real, which is the case
considered in Ref. [36] where we set F I
0 = 0, the right-hand side of Eq. (27) gives 1/

(28)
Eq. (28) indicates that, ¯Ω∼Ω0 defines a crossover scale, such that the dispersion acquires contrasting asymptotes on
moving across it. More explicitly, for Ω≪Ω0, one can ignore the constant term in the parenthesis and the dispersion
relation reduces to Ω∝|¯q|6/5. On the other hand, for Ω≫Ω0, dispersion is linear in momentum: ¯Ω∝|¯q|. For s ≤1,
the right-hand side of Eq. (27) vanishes. Our analysis in Ref. [36] shows that this regime represents the particle-hole
excitations, just like a Fermi liquid, and their dispersions form an energy band. The boundary for the dispersion of this
continuum of excitations is given by the condition s = 1 ⇒¯Ω+ F R
0 (a) = ¯q, and changes qualitatively across Ω0, such that
the curve goes as (a) ¯Ω∼|¯q|3/2 for Ω< Ω0, and (b) ¯Ω∼|¯q| for Ω> Ω0. These were the key findings of Ref. [36].
In the presence of the F I
0 term, the collective-mode frequency can be parametrized as Ω= Ωr + i Ωi, where a nonzero
imaginary part, i Ωi, is explicitly written out. This implies that we must have, in general, s = sr + i si, where there a
nonzero imaginary part in s as well. In fact, sr = (¯Ωr + F R
0 )/|¯q| and si = (¯Ωi + F I
0 )/|¯q|. Let us focus on the positive
values of the real part (i.e., sr ≥0), for which |z−| < 1, resulting in
F R
0 (¯Ω) + i F I
0 (¯Ω) = |¯q|

Separating the real and imaginary parts of Eq. (29), we get two real-valued equations:

r −˜s2
i −|¯q|2 = F R
0 (¯Ω)2 −F I
0 (¯Ω)2 and ˜sr ˜si = F R

0 (¯Ω) , where ˜sr = ¯Ωr + F R
0 (¯Ω) and ˜si = ¯Ωi + F I
0 (¯Ω) .
