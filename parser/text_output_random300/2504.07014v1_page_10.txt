d-dimensional fermions: The order parameter is identified with the volume of the d-
dimensional Fermi sea
P = Ωdkd
F ∝(µ −µc)β ,
(26)
and kF
∝(µ −µc)1/2 = (µ −µc)ν′. All the derivations and explicit formulas for the non-
relativistic and relativistic (Dirac) fermions with the spectra ε(k) = k2/2m, (µc = 0) and
ε(k) = ±
√
k2 + m2, (µc = m), respectively, are collected in Appendix B. The density of the
ground-state grand canonical potential (i.e., pressure) scales as
P(µ) ∝(µ −µc)1+d/2 ,
(27)
and its second derivative
χ◦∝N(µ) ∝(µ −µc)d/2−1 = (µ −µc)−γ .
(28)
Here N(µ) is the density of states per spin or flavor at the Fermi energy µ = εF at T = 0.
We found the following set of critical indices:4
ν′ = ν = 1
2 ,
z = 2 ,
β = dν′ ,
γ = α = 1 −dν′ ,
η′ = d .
(29)
They satisfy the Fisher identity (19) and the (hyper)scaling relations
γ = (2 −η′)ν ,
2 −α = (d + z)ν ,
2β = (d + z −2 + η′)ν .
(30)
With the details of the derivations available in Appendix B, let us make few remarks about
some subtle points of the scaling analysis and the critical indices. The values of ν′, ν we get
directly from behavior of the Lee-Yang zeros (cf. Eqs. (14,15,16)). The index z is obtained
from scaling of the characteristic energy/gap near the critical point:
εF −ε(0) ∝ξ−z
I
,
µ > µc
(31)
∆∝ξ−z ,
µ < µc ,
(32)
where ξI ≡1/kF is the wavelength of oscillations and ξ = 1/κ is the correlation length (not
to be confused). Two indices β and γ follow from (26) and (28). At this point the rest of
indices is fixed by the scaling relations. For instance, α can be obtained from the Fisher
identity (19). Note also that the scaling ansatz (21) implying ∂/∂T
7→∂/∂µ at T = 0
yields α = γ as an identity. An independent confirmation comes from the scaling of the
entanglement capacity C ∝|h−hc|dν−1, proposed in [42] for the d-dimensional case. It agrees
with our result (29) (in the analysis of [42] ν = ν′).5 To get the critical index η′ = d without
explicit use of the hyperscaling relations (30), we analyzed the density response function and
the density-density correlation function D(r). The latter probes the fluctuations of the order
parameter, since P ∝¯n. Near the critical point when r ≪ξI: D(r) ∼k2d
F = 1/ξ(d−2+z+η′)
I
,
in agreement with (29).
Now, when the consistency of the critical behavior of the proposed order parameter with
the scaling properties of other physical parameters is established, we can make conclusions
about the kind of the quantum transition occurring when the FS appears or changes its
connectivity. It depends on the dimension:
4 The dynamical critical index z should not be confused with the notations for the Lee-Yang zeros.
5 Getting the asymptote for the entanglement entropy of the free d-dimensional fermions in the limit
ξI ≫L and T →0 (compare to Eq. (24)) [45] needs further work.
