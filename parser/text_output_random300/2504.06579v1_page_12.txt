With λ = 0, the level 3 remains inaccessible, and hence we have P1(t) + P2(t) = 1,

The above are the expressions for the celebrated Rabi oscillations, describing the time
development of the population of a two-level system undergoing unitary evolution, see
Eq. (8).
(ii) The next limit we want to consider is ∆= 0. In this case, it is easily checked that we have
(22| eU0(s)|11) = (11| eU0(s)|22) = 0, and that (22| eU0(s)|22) = (11|G |11) = 1/(s + λ),
yielding (11| eU0(s)|11) = 1/s. We thus get eP1(s) = (11| eU0(s)|11) = 1/s, resulting in
P1(t) = 1. This is expected; indeed, the system is initially in level 1, but the absence
of the ∆term does not induce any transition to level 2, and hence, application of pulses
inducing transitions between levels 2 and 3 is essentially ineffective in bringing about
any change in the state of the system. Consequently, one has P1(t) = 1 ∀t.
2.2.6. Numerical results on stay-put probability
Here, we provide explicit results on stay-
put probability, based on numerical Laplace inversion of our exact analytical result, Eq. (31).
The first thing we do is to check the validity of our analytical results, by comparing them
with those obtained by evolving numerically the initial density operator ρ(0) in Eq. (26)
according to Eq. (12). In Fig. 1(a), we demonstrate a match between the two results, thereby
validating our analytical results. In panel (b), we plot based on our analytical results the stay-
put probability as a function of λt for given values of ∆and δε and for different values of
λ. The scaling collapse of the data at large times implies the scaling P1(t) = f(λt) at large
times. In panel (c), we show that in fact, one has P1(t) ∼exp(−λt) for large t. On the basis
of results presented in Fig. 2, we conclude that while for t ≪1/λ, we have P1(t) given by
Eq. (48), a result that is an outcome of the coherent evolution of the system, for t ≫1/λ, one
has instead that P1(t) ∼exp(−λt), which stems from decoherence induced into the dynamics
as a result of application of pulses at random times and of random strengths. We thus have a
clear demonstration of coherence-to-decoherence crossover due to coupling with the external
environment, a phenomenon that we demonstrate for our model system on the basis of exact
analytical results derived using the stochastic Liouville equation approach.
3. Conclusion
In the present investigation, we have focused on the effective time-evolution operator in
the Schrödinger picture of the density operator for a generic three-level quantum system.
The formulation is based on how a typical quantum measurement is performed in which an
otherwise unitary evolution under a Hermitian Hamiltonian is subject to (random) influences
of a measuring apparatus [26]. Although the underlying method is reminiscent of the well-
established concepts of Rabi oscillations, magnetic resonance and stochastic theory of spectral
