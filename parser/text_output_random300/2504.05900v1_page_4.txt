number of time and space derivatives acting on a field must be the same. Gauge symmetries,
despite being redundancies in the number of degrees of freedom, are very important to constrain
the form of the interactions. Additionally, the requirement of gauge anomaly cancellation restricts
the number and type of fields. Unitarity does not directly constrain the functional form of the
Lagrangian but tells us about the signs of the probabilities and the arrow(s) of causality. For
example, in the SM the unitarity condition (i.e. the optical theorem) is compatible with physical
states having positive (squared) norms and propagators prescribed with the causal Feynman shift.
Finally, strict renormalizability excludes the possibility that dimensionful couplings control the
UV behavior of a theory. The SM Lagrangian, in which we also include mass terms for neutrinos
via Yukawa interactions with the Higgs, falls into the class of strictly renormalizable QFTs.
Note that if we do not require this last criterion, we would have an infinite number of possible
terms in a Lagrangian, which would significantly decrease the predictive power of the correspond-
ing theory. Let us give some examples to show how strict renormalizability works.
Example 1: Electromagnetic interaction. Imagine that we want to write a Lagrangian
that describes the dynamics of photons, electrons and positrons, including self- and mutual inter-
actions. If we require locality, Poincar´e symmetry, U(1) gauge symmetry and unitarity, but not
strict renormalizability, we would write2
Lem = −1
4FµνF µν −¯ψ (iγµ∂µ + m) ψ −e ¯ψγµAµψ
+ f ¯ψ [γµ, γν] Fµνψ + λ (FµνF µν)2 + · · · ,
(2)
where Fµν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ and the dots represent all infinite terms that are compatible with the
stated requirements. The mass dimensions of the interaction couplings are
[e] = 0 ,
[f] = −1 ,
[λ] = −4 , . . . ,
(3)
and the other infinitely many couplings have negative mass dimensions.
If we also impose strict renormalizability as an additional requirement, we would only write
LQED = −1
4FµνF µν −¯ψ (iγµ∂µ + m) ψ −e ¯ψγµAµψ ,
(4)
and nothing more. This is the Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics (QED) which corresponds
to a strictly renormalizable QFT [8–14,2,3].
Example 2:
Electroweak interaction.
The strict renormalizability criterion can also
help us to understand what to do when we would like to find a new renormalizable Lagrangian
that reproduces a non-renormalizable one in some low-energy regime.
A famous example is
Fermi’s theory of beta decay [15] which is perturbatively non-renormalizable, since the lowest
order interaction term is given by GF( ¯ψψ)2, where GF ≃(245 GeV)−2 and [GF] = −2. Indeed,
2In this work we always work in four spacetime dimensions (D = 1 + 3), adopt the mostly positive convention
for the metric signature (−+ ++), and choose the Natural units system (ℏ= 1 = c).
