The group extension of K0(M7) is given by
0 →Z →K0(M7) →Z2 ⊕Z →0,
(S47)
and the group extension of K1(M7) is given by
0 →Z →K1(M7) →Z →0,
(S48)
With extension in Eq. (S47), K0(M7) can be isomorphic to Z2 ⊕Z2 or Z ⊕Z2. Due to the restriction imposed by
H2(M7, Z), we conclude that K0(M7) ∼= Z ⊕Z3 and eK(M7) ∼= Z ⊕Z2.
Similarly to the previous discussion, we have K1(M7) ∼= Z2.
Hexacosm M8
Observing from Tab. S1, the cohomology groups of M8 are
H1(M8, Z) ∼= Z, H2(M8, Z) ∼= Z.
(S49)
The group extension of K0(M8) is given by
0 →Z →K0(M8) →Z →0,
(S50)
and the group extension of K1(M8) is given by
0 →Z →K1(M8) →Z →0,
(S51)
The extension in Eq. (S50) must be trivial and therefore K0(M8) ∼= Z2 and eK(M8) ∼= Z.
Similarly to the previous discussion, we have K1(M8) ∼= Z2.
Didicosm M9
Observing from Tab. S1, the cohomology groups of M9 are
H1(M9, Z) ∼= Z, H2(M9, Z) ∼= Z2
4.
(S52)
The group extension of K0(M9) is given by
0 →Z →K0(M9) →Z2
4 →0,
(S53)
and the group extension of K1(M9) is given by
0 →0 →K1(M9) →Z →0,
(S54)
With extension in Eq. (S53), K0(M9) can be isomorphic to Z ⊕Z2
4 or Z ⊕Z4. Due to the restriction imposed by
H2(M9, Z), we conclude that K0(M9) ∼= Z ⊕Z2
4 and eK(M9) ∼= Z2
4.
The extension in Eq. (S54) of K1(M9) is trivial, so we have K1(M9) ∼= Z.

The complete set of topological invariants
In this section, we present concrete constructions of topological invariants that characterize topological classifications
over ten Brillouin platycosms.
Cubical torocosm M0
The momentum space Bieberbach group corresponding to the Brillouin cubical torocosm M0 is P1, which exhibits
only translation symmetries along three directions. The cubical torocosm is synonymous with the 3D torus, and the
classification Z3 is a well-known result, characterized by the Chern numbers over three distinct 2D sub-tori. We can
denote the Chern number as Chkx (or Chky, Chkz) to represent the one defined in the ky-kz (or kx-kz, kx-ky) plane
for fixed values of kx (or ky, kz).
