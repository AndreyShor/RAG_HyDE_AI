{Tn(f)}n∈N is the family of (multilevel block) Toeplitz matrices associated with f, which is called the
generating function.

GLT Axioms
For fixed d, r ≥1, a d-level, r-block GLT sequence is a special matrix-sequence equipped with a measurable
function κ : [0, 1]d × [−π, π]d →Cr×r, called symbol. The symbol is essentially unique, in the sense that if
κ, ς are two symbols of the same GLT sequence, then κ = ς a.e. We write {An}n ∼GLT κ to denote that
{An}n is a GLT sequence with symbol κ.
For d = r = 1, it can be proven that the set of GLT sequences is the ∗-algebra generated by the three classes
of matrix-sequences defined in 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, via the closure in the a.c.s. topology in [12]: zero-distributed,
Toeplitz, and diagonal sampling matrix-sequences are indeed the generators of the induced ∗-algebra. The
GLT classes satisfy several algebraic and topological properties that are treated in detail in [5, 6, 14, 15].
Here, we focus on the case of interest of r = d = 1 and on the main operative properties, listed below, that
represent a complete characterization of scalar unilevel GLT matrix-sequences [14], equivalent to the full
constructive definition in [25].
• GLT 1. If {An}n ∼GLT κ then {An}n ∼σ κ in the sense of Definition 1, with t = 2 and D =
[0, 1] × [−π, π]. Moreover, if each An is Hermitian, then {An}n ∼λ κ, again in the sense of Definition
1 with t = 2.
• GLT 2. We have
– {Tn(f)}n ∼GLT κ(x, θ) = f(θ) if f : [−π, π] →C is in L1([−π, π]);
– {Dn(a)}n ∼GLT κ(x, θ) = a(x) if a : [0, 1] →C is Riemann-integrable;
– {Zn}n ∼GLT κ(x, θ) = 0 if and only if {Zn}n ∼σ 0.
• GLT 3. If {An}n ∼GLT κ and {Bn}n ∼GLT ς, then
– {A∗
n}n ∼GLT κ∗;
– {αAn + βBn}n ∼GLT ακ + βς for all α, β ∈C;
