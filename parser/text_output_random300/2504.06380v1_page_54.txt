To visualize the crossover between dRxx
dT
> 0 to dRxx
dT
< 0 (or vice versa) driven by IDC at finite D,
we again plotted the temperature derivative of differential resistance for few selected values of IDC. For the
ease of notational representation of dVxx/dI, it has been replaced with δRxx in these plots. In SI-Fig. 24a
(middle panel) δRxx(≡Rxx) increases with increasing T in the filling range of 2 < ν < 3.2. dδRxx/dT
is also positive for this region as shown in SI-Fig. 24a (right panel). Normal ‘upwards’ hysteresis phase
centred around ν ∼2 and ∼3 at D = 0.60 V/nm conform to this experimental condition. The situation
changes when IDC ∼21 nA, δRxx starts decreasing with increasing T around ν ∼2 and ∼3, and we
get dδRxx/dT < 0 around these filling factors (SI-Fig. 24b (right panel)). With increasing IDC further,
the behavior of δRxx with T is found to be completely reversed (SI-Fig. 24c,d) with a negative value of
dδRxx/dT taking up nearly whole of the filling phase space around ν ∼2.4 −3.2 at IDC = 45 nA (SI-Fig.
24d (right panel))

dI
plotted as a function of applied IDC with
increasing T from 20 mK to 1 K for D = 0.60 V/nm at ν values of a) 2.2, b) 2.8, and c) 3.2. Dashed
vertical lines are for IDC values of 0, 21.60 nA, 36 nA, and 45 nA. dVxx/dI increases with increasing T but
the behavior reverses (dVxx/dI decreases with increasing T) at a sufficiently higher value of IDC defined
as Is. The Is values for the three filling factors are ∼21 nA (ν = 2.2), ∼25 nA (ν = 2.8), and ∼22 nA
(ν = 3.2).
