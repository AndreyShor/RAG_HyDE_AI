Note that m = b + γq is the moist static energy of the model, and the moist
pseudoadiabat is defined as a profile for which dm/dz = 0 and q = qs (Vallis et al.
2019). Imposing moist pseudoadiabatic boundary conditions allows the temperature
and moisture to adjust to moist convection. In Vallis et al. (2019), Oishi and Brown
(2024) and Agasthya et al. (2025), both T(H) and q(H) were fixed, so there was
no possibility to adjust the upper levels to a convectively controlled profile, and the
stratification leads to an unrealistic downward heat flux. In the real atmosphere,
the diffusive fluxes of buoyancy and humidity (κ ∂b/∂z, κq ∂q/∂z) are small at the
tropopause, and the profile is close to the moist pseudoadiabat, especially in the
tropics. The top boundary conditions are consistent with atmospheric conditions at
the tropopause, and they additionally allow convective adjustment of the profiles.
The idealised climate change scenario is imposed by increasing both radiative
cooling and surface temperature, inline with Figure 4 of Jeevanjee and Fueglistaler
(2020). We consider climate change (increasing both r&∆Tsurf) for a range of different
surface relative humidities in the following analysis.
2.2.
Dry Adiabatic Buoyancy Non-Dimensionalisation
Following Appendix 7.1 in Vallis et al. (2019), we use a “buoyancy based non-
dimensionalisation”. We cannot use the classical Rayleigh-B´enard temperature
scale [T] = T(0) −T(H), since T(H) is free to adjust to moist convection un-
der our moist pseudoadiabtic boundary conditions specified in Section 2.1. The
temperature scale is instead set by the dry adiabatic temperature difference,
[T] = Td(0) −Td(H) = gH/cp ∼100K.
We use equation (4) to set the buoyancy scale to be proportional to the temperature
scale, [B] = g[T]/θ0 ∼3.3ms−2. The length scale is defined to be height of the
domain, [L] = H ∼10km, and we define the timescale using [t] = ([L]/[b])1/2 ∼55s.
We scale the specific humidity by [q] = q0 ∼3.8 × 10−3 which is lower than its real
value (see Appendix C), to ensure that the fluxes of buoyancy and humidity are small
at the top boundary. The velocity scale is set by [U] = [L]/[t] ∼180ms−1 and the
pressure scale by [ϕ] = [U]2 ∼3.3 × 105Pa. The non-dimensional system is then given
