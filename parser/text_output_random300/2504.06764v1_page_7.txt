dynamics simulation. Note that the equation set of total torque for each layer remain the 
same when the order of the layer labelling is reversed. Hence, both {mi =meqi, i =1…N} 
and {mN+1-i =meqi, i =1…N} are the equilibrium states, where {meqi, i =1…N} is one of the 
solutions of the equation set. When N is an even number, it indicates that reversing the 
Néel vector can also satisfy the equilibrium condition, so SOT-induced deterministic 
switching cannot be achieved in an A-type antiferromagnet with even-number layers.  
By solving the condition of total torque equilibrium, we can reproduce the SOT 
switching behaviour of an A-type antiferromagnet with odd-number layers (Fig. 4a). With 
a fixed in-plane magnetic field, SOTs gradually rotate the Néel vector within the yz plane. 
Until, for a sufficiently large SOTs, the Néel vector abruptly rotates to the opposite 
direction, indicating the switching. We next vary the layer number of the antiferromagnet 
(Fig. 4b). The field-dependence of switching currents in antiferromagnets is very weak, 
which is different from that in a ferromagnet (N =1) and agrees with the experimental 
observation (Fig. S6). We further study the spin dynamics during the switching of the Néel 
vector by solving Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert (LLG) equations (Supplementary Note 7). As 
a consequence of strong interlayer exchange interaction, two spin sublattices keep nearly 
antiparallel and precess together to the opposite direction (Fig. 4c). The strong exchange 
interaction also yields a fast precession frequency, leading to a fast-switching time (Figs. 
4d and S10). Therefore, our theoretical model offers insights into the SOT-induced 
switching dynamics in A-type antiferromagnets. Note that accurate controlling of atomic 
layer number is highly challenging in conventional thin-film antiferromagnets. In contrast, 
vdW antiferromagnets, with the unique atomically exfoliable property, enable precise 
control over the atomic layer number, thus providing an ideal material platform for SOT 
switching studies.  
Field-free switching in Pt/FCGT/CrSBr 
In the conventional SOT switching scheme, an in-plane magnetic field is 
indispensable to achieve the deterministic switching of a PMA magnetization29,30. Similar 
to ferromagnet, we cannot achieve the switching of Néel vector in Pt/FCGT devices in the 
absence of in-plane magnetic fields (Fig. S12). However, in real applications, this is
