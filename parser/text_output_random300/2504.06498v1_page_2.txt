Introduction
Masers and lasers have revolutionized science and technology, finding applications in fields as
diverse as telecommunications, medical diagnostics, astronomy, precision measurements, and fun-
damental physics (1–7). Both technologies harness coherent electromagnetic radiation amplified
through the process of stimulated emission (8), a phenomenon that traditionally requires achieving
population inversion between quantized energy states (i.e., a higher-energy state has to be more
populated than a lower-energy state) (9).
Conventional masers have been realized across various physical systems, including molecular
gases (1), noble gases (10), and solid-state defects (11, 12). These devices typically operate in
the GHz frequency range, achieving the population inversion via various mechanisms. Recent
advances extended these principles to the so-called “rasers” generating kHz-to-MHz frequencies
using nuclear spins (13,14). To create the required population inversion, such low-frequency rasers
rely on hyperpolarization approaches such as spin-exchange optical pumping (15), dynamic nuclear
polarization (16), photochemical polarization transfers (17), and parahydrogen-based techniques
(18, 19). Additionally, their emission amplification is typically triggered by “radiation damping”
(20), stemming from inductive coupling of polarized nuclear spins with detection coils. However,
these rasers exhibit intrinsic limitations as they operate on Zeeman-split levels. Since the frequencies
of these levels depend on the applied (bias) magnetic field, they are susceptible to magnetic field
drifts, limiting their long-term stability and reproducibility.
In this work, we introduce zero-field quantum oscillators operating at frequencies from near-
DC to tens of hertz, overcoming limitations of conventional rasers that rely on Zeeman-split levels.
Unlike those, our oscillators function without a bias field, exploiting intrinsic nuclear spin-spin
scalar interactions (𝐽-couplings) within molecules (21, 22). Importantly, they utilize Δ𝑚= 0
transitions (22), with the quantization axis along the measurement axis (Fig. 1A,B). Because these
transition frequencies depend primarily on molecular 𝐽-coupling constants (22), the zero-field
quantum oscillators achieve significantly improved frequency stability: coherent operation of up
to 1 h is demonstrated (Fig. 1D). The magnetic oscillation occurs along the same axis as the
feedback axis due to Δ𝑚= 0 transitions (22), unlike the precessing magnetization with Δ𝑚=
±1 of conventional rasers. Such an oscillator requires only a population imbalance—not a strict
