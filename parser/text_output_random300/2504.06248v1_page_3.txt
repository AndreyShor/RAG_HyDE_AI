symmetrizable [Lem. S4]. Finally, condition 1.4 implies
that the submatrix (αjk)j,k∈W with αjk = 0 whenever
Wjk = 0 is antisymmetric. It ensures that for each os-
cillator pair (j, k) such that Wjk ̸= 0, there is an angle
αjk = θk −θj such that the pair does not interact.
Consequently, if there are q functionally independent
monomial eigenfunctions zµ1, . . . , zµq for K with µρ ∈
RN and eigenvalues iµ⊤
ρ ω, then there are q constants of
motion having the form zµρexp(−iµ⊤
ρ ω t). Of course, if
the natural frequencies are such that µ⊤
ρ ω = 0 for some
ρ, the constant of motion is time-independent (some-
times called integral of motion or first integral), but
one doesn’t have to restrict the natural frequencies to
get rid of explicit time dependency. Indeed, given the
above q monomial eigenfunctions, one can always con-
struct q−1 functionally independent monomial constants
of motion zν1, , . . . , zνq−1, whose exponents satisfy the
matrix equation (ν1 · · · νq−1) = (µ1 · · · µq) O, where
O ∈Rq×(q−1) has linearly independent columns orthogo-
nal to (iµ⊤
1 ω · · · iµ⊤
q ω) [Lem. S5]. Intuitively, the exis-
tence of a monomial conserved quantity is guaranteed by
the presence of any two or more source subgraphs with
monomial eigenfunctions, no matter how far away they
are from each other in the graph.
Theorem 1 thus provides one form of constants of mo-
tion, but how to derive other ones ? For that, it is instruc-
tive to look more carefully at the Koopman generator
and address the case of identical oscillators (ωj = ω ∈R,
αjk = 0 and Wjk = 1 for all j, k ∈V). In such case,
K = p(z)L−1 + iωL0 −p(z)L1

becomes associated to an element of the Lie algebra for
the projective special unitary group PSU(1, 1), where

for n ∈{−1, 0, 1} are the generators of the algebra,
p(z) = (σ/2) PN
j=1 zj and p(z) is its complex conjugate.
But for every dynamics with Koopman generator of the
form α(t, z)L−1 + β(t, z)L0 + γ(t, z)L1 [57] (e.g., Win-
free [58], theta [59], or Riccati dynamics), if one finds
a joint invariant [60, 61] for L−1, L0, L1, i.e., such that
Ln[C(z)] = 0 for all n ∈{−1, 0, 1}, then C is a constant
of motion. The method of characteristics makes it possi-
ble to deduce the exact form of such joint invariant: the
cross-ratio

for non-identical indices a, b, c, d

[Sec. III B].
This represents a simple systematic method for de-
riving the conservation of cross-ratios for identical
phase oscillators, a result that was distinctly estab-
lished in Ref. [62] alongside its link with the constants
of motion originally found by Watanabe and Strogatz
(“WS integrals”): Cws
i1...iN
=
Si1i2Si2i3...SiN−1iN SiNi1
with
Sjk(θ) = sin((θj −θk)/2).
Indeed,
cabcd

acdb i5...iN /Cws
adcb i5...iN = (ScaSdb)/(ScbSda) [63].
Knowing that cross-ratios are constants of motion for
identical Kuramoto oscillators, what are the conditions
on A so that K[cabcd(z)] = 0 ? This question leads us
to obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions for con-
serving cross-ratios [proof in Sec. III D].
Theorem 2 (Cross-ratio conservation). The cross-ratio
cabcd is a constant of motion of the Kuramoto model (1)
if and only if the vertices a, b, c, and d of the graph
described by the complex matrix in Eq. (3) have the same:
2.1. outgoing interactions within {a, b, c, d}, i.e.,
Aba = Aca = Ada =: Aa ,
Aab = Acb = Adb =: Ab ,
Aac = Abc = Adc =: Ac ,
Aad = Abd = Acd =: Ad ,
2.2. incoming interactions from V \ {a, b, c, d}, i.e.,
Aak = Abk = Ack = Adk ,
∀k ∈V \ {a, b, c, d}
2.3. shifted natural frequencies
ωj −2 Im(Aj) = ωk −2 Im(Ak),
∀j, k ∈{a, b, c, d} .
Condition 2.1 and 2.2 can be formulated together as
Aak = Abk = Ack = Adk for all k ∈V, but separat-
ing them offers clearer insights into the underlying net-
work structure. Indeed, as illustrated in Fig. 2 (b), con-
dition 2.1 constrains the possible directed network motifs
that allow a cross-ratio to be a constant of motion. Con-
dition 2.2 clarifies how these motifs can receive incom-
ing edges from other vertices, e.g., a vertex k1 can send
equally-weighted edges to {a, b, c, d} and another vertex
k2 can do the same with different equally-weighted edges.
Yet, there is no restriction on the outgoing edges from the
vertices involved in conserved cross-ratios to the vertices
not involved in a conserved cross-ratio or a monomial
eigenfunction. It is thus possible to connect these mo-
tifs in various ways, ultimately leading to a diverse fam-
ily of weighted, directed, signed and modular networks
with conserved cross-ratios. Finally, condition 2.3 makes
the oscillators have the same effective natural frequency.
Basic examples of cross-ratio conservation are given in
Fig. 2(b) and in SI [Sec. III E].
Theorem 2 readily provides the necessary and sufficient
conditions to have N −3 constants of motion having the
form of cross-ratios. Indeed, the model maximally has
N −3 constants of motion having the form of functionally
independent cross-ratios if and only if
2A. Ajℓ= Akℓ=: Aℓfor all ℓ∈V ,
2B. ωj −2 Im(Aj) = ωk −2 Im(Ak) ,
for all pairs (j, k) with j, k ∈V and k, ℓ̸= j [Cor. S17].
These conditions were previously recognized, in a differ-
ent form, to be sufficient [64] and we thus add that they
are also necessary. As a consequence, there are N differ-
ent directed graphs (non-isomorphic, weakly connected,
