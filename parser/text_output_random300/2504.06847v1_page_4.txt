of polar 2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) hydrogen phosphite 2-AmpH2PO3 crystals. The 
accompanying structural and spectroscopic analysis of 2-Amp sulfates provides not only 
valuable “reference” materials (necessary for the vibrational spectroscopic study) but also new 
experimental data on bis(2-aminopyrimidinium(1+)) sulfate monohydrate (2-Amp)2SO4H2O 
and two polymorphs of 2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) hydrogen sulfate (2-AmpHSO4 (I) and (II)) 
in a comprehensive study of inorganic salts of 2-aminopyrimidine.  
An extensive vibrational spectroscopic study of four related title salts enhances our 
understanding of vibrational manifestations of the 2-Amp(1+) cation as a carrier of NLO 
properties in the solid state. These findings are highly useful for IR and Raman spectroscopy 
applications, especially for phase analysis, including a study of polymorphism and phase 
transformations. Moreover, our detailed assignment of spectra of novel NLO materials 
promotes the understanding of vibrational contributions to hyperpolarizability [26] and 
processes associated with Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) [27, 28].  
  
2. Experimental 
2.1. Materials and methods 
The compound 2-AmpH2PO3 was synthesized from an aqueous solution of 2-
aminopyrimidine (97%, Fluka) and 2 mol.L-1 phosphorous acid (purum, p.a., Fluka), mixed in 
the molar ratio 1:1. Small crystals were obtained by evaporation of the solution at room 
temperature. The aqueous solutions of 2-aminopyrimidine (97%, Fluka) and 2 mol.L-1 sulphuric 
acid (96%, p.a., Lachema), mixed in the molar ratios 1:1 and 2:1, by slow evaporation at room 
temperature provide 2-AmpHSO4 (I) and (2-Amp)2SO4H2O, respectively. Only a few crystals 
of 2-AmpHSO4 (II) phase were isolated from the ethanol-water (ratio 1:2) solution of 2-
aminopyrimidine (97%, Fluka) to which 2 mol.L-1 solution of sulphuric acid (96%, p.a., 
Lachema) was added dropwise to achieve a molar ratio of 1:1.4 (base to acid). The solution was 
intensively stirred for 20 min and left to slowly evaporate at room temperature until the 
formation of colourless intergrown crystals of both polymorphs of 2-AmpHSO4, which were 
separated under a microscope. A limited amount of obtained 2-AmpHSO4 (II) crystals enabled 
only single-crystal X-ray diffraction and micro-spectroscopic characterization of this phase. 
The reference compound for the vibrational spectroscopic study – crystalline 2-
aminopyrimidinium(1+) chloride hemihydrate (2-AmpCl½H2O) – was isolated (at room 
temperature) from an aqueous solution of 2-aminopyrimidine (97%, Fluka) and 2 mol.L-1 
hydrochloric acid (35%, p.a, Lach-ner), mixed in the molar ratio 1:1.
