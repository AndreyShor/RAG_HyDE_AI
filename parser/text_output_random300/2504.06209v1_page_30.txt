FIG. 16. Bayesian network for an product environment channel (lemma 7) with colored d-separarion (blue d-separates red and
green) used in the proof of Theorem 6.
order to show that (bt) is monotone increasing, we use the chain rule for mutual information in the form of eq. (A10)
with W = St+j, X = Aj+1:t+j+1Sj:t+j, Y = A0:jS0:j and Z = Mt+j:
I[A0:t+j+1S0:t+j; St+j|Mt+j] = I[Aj:t+j+1Sj:t+j; St+j|Mt+j] + I[A0:jS0:j; St|MtAj:t+j+1Sj:t+j].
(F30)
Using stationarity (eq. (F25)) of the process MAS, we find pM0:t+1A0:t+1S0:t+1 = pMj:t+j+1Aj:t+j+1Sj:t+j+1 for any
t, j ∈N0, which can be marginalized to the statement pMtA0:t+1S0:t = pMt+jAj:t+j+1Sj:t+j. Thus, I[A0:t+1S0:t; St|Mt] =
I[Aj:t+j+1Sj:t+j; St+j|Mt+j]. Plugging this into eq. (F30) yields
I[A0:t+j+1S0:t+j; St+j|Mt+j] = I[A0:t+1S0:t; St|Mt] + I[A0:jS0:j; St|MtAj:t+j+1Sj:t+j].
(F31)
From this, using the nonnegativity of mutual information, we obtain
I[A0:t+j+1S0:t+j; St+j|Mt+j] ≥I[A0:t+1S0:t; St|Mt]
∀t, j ∈N0,
(F32)
or equivalently bt+j ≥bt, which proves that (bt) is monotone increasing.
Further, since cN is defined as the arithmetic mean of b0, b1, . . . , bN−1, we have that cN is bounded and monotone
increasing as N →∞.
We are now in the position to prove the first part of the theorem. By the monotone convergence theorem and the
properties of cN, the limit lim
N→∞cN exists and equals the supremum. Therefore, eq. (F24) holds true if and only if cN
is zero for all N ∈N0 which, in turn, is the case if and only if bt is zero for all t ∈N0. Further, by lemma 8, this is
equivalent to eq. (F26) which concludes the proof of the first part of the theorem.
For the second part of the theorem, we need to show that, given the assumption that the environment channel is
also a product channel, eq. (F25) is equivalent to eq. (F26). Using the single-step chain rule of mutual information
(eq. (A10)), we can split up eq. (F25) as
I[A0:t+1S0:t; St:∞|Mt] = I[S0:t; St:∞|Mt] + I[A0:t+1; St|MtS0:t]
∀t ∈N0
(F33)
The second term on the right-hand side vanishes for product environment channels due to d-separation (see Figure 16)
and the first term corresponds to eq. (F26) which concludes the proof.
The next theorem provides a condition for the existence of predictive agent models:
Theorem 7. Let agt →
←env be any percept-action loop. If the environment channel is unifilar, then there exists an
a.m. predictive agent model agtM for agt.
The proof is based on the idea that the agent’s memory can be extended to store and update the hidden state
of the unifilar environment model. Knowledge of the hidden states of an environment model makes the agent predictive.
Proof. The proof proceeds by construction.
Let
• agtM′ = (Θagt, pM ′
0A0) be a Markov model for agt with memory states M′;
• envM = (Φenv, pZ0) be a unifilar Markov model for env on some hidden-state alphabet Z.
