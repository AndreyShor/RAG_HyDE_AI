deﬁnes the overlap scaling dimension Xq. Spin glass criticality amounts to overlap criticality
outside the ferromagnetic region and its boundary. Numerical consensus developed since [19]
(see also [28] for analytical arguments) on the fact that in two dimensions there is no ﬁnite
temperature transition to a spin glass phase and that spin glass criticality occurs only at
T = 0. The overlap correlation length is observed to diverge as ξO ∼T −νSG and the value of
νSG is expected to be ruled by a zero temperature spin glass ﬁxed point G (see Figure 1). On
bipartite lattices, for which the phase diagram is symmetric under p →1 −p, G is expected
to fall at p = 1/2; many numerical studies of spin glass properties focus on this value.

Exact ﬁxed point equations
The discussion of the previous section shows that the study of overlap properties amounts to
consider the Hamiltonian

of N decoupled Ising copies with the same disorder realization.
For N = 1 one recovers
the Hamiltonian (1) which is suﬃcient for the study of the magnetic properties. For N ̸= 1
diﬀerent copies are correlated by the disorder average. Quenched disorder corresponds to the
fact that the average over the random variables Jxy is taken on the free energy −ln Z, where
Z =

through which the average over disorder has the eﬀect of coupling n →0 replicas of the
system with Hamiltonian (8).
It was shown in [6] (see [14] for a review) that in two dimensions the replica method
can be implemented in an exact way at renormalization group ﬁxed points, which in the
continuum correspond to conformal ﬁeld theories. One uses the scattering framework of [29],
in which one of the two spatial dimensions plays the role of imaginary time, and exploits
the fact that inﬁnite-dimensional conformal symmetry in two dimensions [7] yields inﬁnitely
many quantities conserved in scattering processes.
This forces initial and ﬁnal states to
be kinematically identical (complete elasticity), while scale and relativistic invariance make
