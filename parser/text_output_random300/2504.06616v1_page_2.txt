emission, followed by a quiescent period.
Some stud-
ies have indicated that precursors may contain quasi-
thermal radiation components (Wang et al. 2020), sug-
gesting the possibility of different radiation mechanisms
compared to the main emission. This provides clues for
the study of the progenitor stars of GRBs (Zhong et al.
2019). In practice, many searches for precursors have
been conducted. The precursors were first identified in
long GRBs (e.g. Lazzati 2005; Burlon et al. 2008, 2009;
Zhang et al. 2018), and subsequently, they were also dis-
covered in short GRBs (e.g. Troja et al. 2010; Minaev &
Pozanenko 2017). The common approach involves using
the Bayesian Block method and background estimation
to search for precursors (Coppin et al. 2020). The search
results reveal that only a small fraction of GRBs have
precursors, with the precursor and quiescent period be-
tween precurosr and main burst for long GRBs generally
longer than that of short GRBs. Some GRBs even show
the presence of multiple precursors (Coppin et al. 2020).
Extended emission generally refers to a prolonged pe-
riod of weak radiation that occurs after the main emis-
sion. Typically, the extended emission of short GRBs
receives more attention (Barthelmy et al. 2005; Norris
& Bonnell 2006; Perley et al. 2009). The mechanism of
the production of extended emission remains an open
question, with several potential models including fall-
back accretion or later reactivity of the central magne-
tar (Metzger et al. 2008; Gibson et al. 2017; Bucciantini
et al. 2011).
Similarly to precursors, searches of ex-
tended emission are usually based on the Bayesian Block
method and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (Kaneko et al.
2015; Zhang et al. 2020).
In addition to duration, there are significant differ-
ences in the temporal and spectral characteristics of
these two types of GRBs. For instance, Type I GRBs
exhibit a harder energy spectrum (Kouveliotou et al.
1993b), shorter minimum variability timescales (MVT)
(Golkhou et al. 2015), and smaller spectral lags (Norris
& Bonnell 2006; Gehrels et al. 2006) than that of Type
II GRBs. Moreover, empirical correlations between var-
ious observational characteristics can serve as tools to
classify GRBs, such as the Amati relation (Amati et al.
2002). In particular, the Amati relation has been uti-
lized as a key indicator for classification of type I or type
II GRBs. Overall, with the increasing observational ev-
idence and the establishment of empirical relationships,
the classification of GRBs seems to be successful for
most cases.
As the sample of the detections expands, special
events emerge. Some GRBs have long durations but ex-
hibit some properties mentioned above that fall within
Type I GRB region.
Even some of them (e.g.
GRB
211211A, GRB 230307A) are associated with kilonova
(Rastinejad et al. 2022; Levan et al. 2024). There are
more and more such events, leading to the colloquial des-
ignation of these GRBs as “long” short bursts. Typical
examples of “long” short bursts include GRB 060614
(Gehrels et al. 2006), GRB 211227A (L¨u et al. 2022),
and GRB 211211A (Yang et al. 2022). In fact, the light
curves of GRB 060614 and GRB 211227A are quite sim-
ilar, both featuring a short hard peak with a duration
of approximately 5 s, followed by a soft and prolonged
extended emission lasting nearly 100 s, which accounts
for their long duration; therefore, such GRBs are also
called sGRBEE. In contrast, GRB 211211A and GRB
230307A exhibit different light curve shapes from the
previous two GRBs: first, they have a precursor (Xiao
et al. 2024); second, their main emission durations ex-
ceed 10 seconds (Wang et al. 2024). This indicates that
the long timescale of these two GRBs is not primar-
ily due to the contribution of soft extended emission
(though it also contributes some); rather, it is attributed
to the hard and long main emission (∼10 seconds),
thus distinguishing them from the typical “long” short
bursts.
By identifying the different light curve pattern from
the traditional “long” short bursts, the concept of Type
IL GRB was introduced (Wang et al. 2024). The light
curve pattern of Type IL GRB exhibits the following
characteristics: short precursor, short quiescent period
(that is, the interval between the precursor and the main
emission), long main emission, extended emission, and
a dip structure between the main emission and the ex-
tended emission.
Although these GRBs have a long
duration, their observational characteristics fall within
Type I GRB region; hence, they are classified as a sub-
class of Type I GRB.
To validate the universality of the concept of Type
IL GRB and to expand Type IL GRB sample, Wang
et al. (2024) conducted a preliminary search in the
Fermi/GBM burst catalog and found GRB 170228A.
Its light curve pattern and observational properties are
similar to GRB 230207A and GRB 211211A, support-
ing its Type IL nature. However, the search in Wang
et al. (2024) solely relied on the visual identification of
the precursor and extended emission and is very time-
consuming.
In this work, we establish a criterion for automatically
identifying Type IL GRB based on their light curve pat-
terns. Using the Bayesian Block method (Scargle et al.
2013), we propose stringent criteria and search method-
ologies to determine the presence of precursors, extended
emissions, and dip structures, ultimately allowing us to
determine whether a specific GRB should be classified
