QUBO-mapped physical systems that call for being

For instance, in-

and RNA secondary structure predictions, which have
all been mapped to QUBO models.

RECONSTRUCTION FOR THE L × L ISING
SYSTEM
QUBO model for the L × L Ising system
To perform the QUBO-based reconstruction of W for
the 2D Ising system, we introduce the following QUBO-
Hamiltonian, which involves site (σi) and edge (ηij, θij)
variables on the L × L lattice, as well as slack variables
(sk):
H = H0 + AHs =
X
⟨ij⟩
Vij + AHs ,
(14)
where:
Vij = (1 + 2σiσj + 2(σi + σj)ηij
−4(σi + σj + ηij)θij −σi −σj −ηij + 8θij)

In the above expressions, A is a non-negative coefficient,
which we set equal to 1, and P
⟨ij⟩indicates the summa-
tion over distinct pairs of neighboring lattice sites.
The σi = 0, 1 binary site variables are in one-to-one
correspondence with the up/down spins of the physical
Ising model. The η binary variables are instead intro-
duced to keep track of parallel and antiparallel neighbor-
ing spins. They are tied to the σs by an XNOR relation,
which is enforced as a quadratic QUBO constraint in-
volving the binary ancilla variables, θ. This is best seen
by setting A = 0, which reduces the QUBO Hamiltonian
to H0. In this case, minimizing the Hamiltonian for a
given spin configuration σ amounts to minimizing the in-
dividual quadratic terms Vij, yielding the sought XNOR
relation:
ηij =
(
1
if σi = σj,
0
otherwise.
(17)
We note that the expressions for Vij are constructed
such that for any set of the σ variables – each mappable
to a unique set of physical spins – the energy-minimizing
ηs and θs yield H0 = 0. Thus, the degenerate ground
states of H0 are in one-to-one correspondence with the
possible spin configurations and, thanks to the ancilla θ
variables, also with the associated ηs, which represent the
parallel or antiparallel alignment of neighboring spins.
A schematic representation of the σ and η variables of
a ground state solution of H0 in a 4 × 4 system is shown
in Fig. 4.
The second quadratic term in eq. 14, which involves
slack variables, has the same structure as that of eq. 4.
Its minimization ensures that the number of parallel
spins, 2nq = P
⟨ij⟩ηij, falls within the interval [2¯nq, 2¯nq+
2m+1 −2].
