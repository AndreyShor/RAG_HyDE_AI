Table I. Tabulated runtime values for solving reconfiguration problems on chains and grids. Values are averaged over one
thousand realizations of a typical problem. The first column reports values for preparing center-compact configurations on
chains using the exact 1D algorithm. The second column report values for preparing center-compact configurations on grids
using the latest version of the red rec CPU algorithm. Values reported for steps labeled by stars are theoretical values. The
problem instances are randomly generated based on an ϵ = 0.6 initial probability of the presence of a particle in a trap.
active rows, 2 transition rows, and a storage section of
1037 rows. The reference rows, transition rows, and stor-
age section are shielded from external light, exposing only
the image section. In the horizontal direction, the sensor
has 1056 pixels, but the image section is shielded on both
sides by 16 dark reference pixels, providing an effective
image area of 1024×1024 px. The sensor is located above
a single-row amplification and readout section containing
1056 registers which is next to into a distribution chain of
468 pixels and a multiplication chain of 604 pixels. The
readout section is enclosed by 16 additional overscan pix-
els on each side before the linkage to the analog-to-digital
converter.
We estimate the vertical frame transfer time from the
image section to the storage section to be (1037+2)/vV =
4.499 ms, where vV = 4.33 µs/px is the vertical shift
speed per row.
Assuming that the bottom row of the
storage section is shifted to the readout region as soon
as the receiving registers have been emptied, the frame
readout time for each row is equal to the vertical shift
time, tV = 1/vV , plus the latency time for reading out
the stray charges by horizontally shifting the pixels along
the readout region (NH columns of the image), the dark
references (32 pixels), and the overscan elements (16 pix-
els).
Given NV rows, the frame readout time is thus
NV (tV + (NH + 48)/vH), which is equal to 41 µs at
full frame for NV = 1024, NH = 1024, and horizontal
shift rate of vH = 30 µs/px. There is an additional con-
stant offset for horizontally shifting the pixels through
the dump region which includes the chain of 1072 gain
elements and the overscan elements (16 pixels) at the
start of the readout.
The frame transfer and readout time can be reduced
by restricting the region of interest (ROI), defined as the
contiguous set of pixels starting with the one closest to
the detection region.
As expected, our measurements
shows that the frame transfer and readout time depends
linearly on the height of the ROI (see Fig. 5a). This time
can be further reduced by restricting the width of the
region of interest to a power of two (see Fig. 5b). The
readout time can be further reduced by vertically binning
the pixels, which decreases by a factor of two with each
doubling of the binning size in powers of two (Fig. 5d).
However, horizontal binning does not affect the readout
time.
We explain the difference between the measured and
predicted readout time by the transfer time from the
FGC to the processor. A linear fit to the residuals (see
Fig. 5c) show a transfer rate of 1.431 GBps for 2 B/px,
which is consistent to the rate of 1.7 GBps expected for
the FGC using DMA transfer via 4-lane Gen2 PCIe pro-
tocol. A similar transfer rate of 1.206 GBps is obtained
when transferring data from the FGC to the GPU using
RDMA transfer.
