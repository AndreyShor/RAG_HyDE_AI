set consists of a tensor that contains 500 snapshots. A total of 100 snapshots have been
predicted to compare with the last 100 ground truth snapshots. Figure 11 and 12 illustrate
the ground truth and the predictions for the streamwise and normal velocity components,
respectively, at the time step t = 428, providing a reference for evaluating the modelâ€™s
predictive performance. The figures below present the predicted streamwise and normal
velocity components for both the HOSVD and SVD approaches using LSTM architectures
with 1 dense, 2 dense, and time-distributed layers. The first column represents predictions
from the HOSVD-based method, while the second column corresponds to predictions
from the SVD-based method.
Each row sequentially depicts the results for different
architectures: the first row for LSTM with 1 dense, the second row for LSTM with 2
dense, and the third row for LSTM with time-distributed. After the snapshots, the average
RRMSE was presented, followed by the temporal evolution of the flow at a representative
point in the wake and the UQ results. This provides a deeper insight into the accuracy
of the predictions over time.
The most notable observation is that HOSVD provides smoother and more consistent
predictions compared to SVD. This can be attributed to its ability to handle the multi-
dimensional nature of the tensor data more effectively, preserving spatial and temporal
correlations during dimensionality reduction. For the streamwise velocity components,
HOSVD handles regions with sharp transitions and high gradients more effectively, en-
suring better alignment with the ground truth. In contrast, for certain snapshots, like at t
= 428, SVD predicts an averaged flow in some areas, demonstrating its limitations in pre-
serving temporal consistency. However, the combination of SVD with the time-distributed
architecture performs reasonably well, generating snapshots visually comparable to those
obtained from the HOSVD models. The normal velocity predictions from the HOSVD
and SVD models are quite similar to the ground truth and are robust, capturing subtle
variations and maintaining consistency across the entire flow field.
