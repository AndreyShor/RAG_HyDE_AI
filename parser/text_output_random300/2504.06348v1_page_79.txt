where µ = 1 + ⌊log(maxj{|kp

For readability, we drop the ζ, l and α dependence (and the s dependence for the local term) in the
compilation below and reintroduce them when needed for resource estimates.
We will also absorb the
parameter ¯rζ
l in the 1-norm into the parameter γζ,l
α .
Preparing superpositions over the points in ♢is
nontrivial, and instead we opt to prepare superpositions over simpler domains and then use amplitude
amplification to remove parts that we don’t want.
In particular, let □ins = {p : |pa| ≤pins, ∀a} and
□circ = {p : |pa| ≤pcirc, ∀a} be the squares that inscribe and circumscribe ♢, respectively.
Also, let
□out = {p : |pa| ≤pmax −pins, ∀a}. As written, ∥kp∥1 = P
j |kp
(j)| is not immediately separable into
its pa components and so is not simply preparable as a product state over a (which would complicate the
compilation). However, define the indicator
Ij =
(
0

a pab(j)
a

a pab(j)

, which is separable. For each
component pa, we will load rotation angles that, if implemented appropriately, approximate a rotation by
γ P
j(−1)Ijb(j)
a .
To prepare the state, we first initialize and rotate an ancilla to match the relative weight of the two
branches of the reference, |ψ0⟩= cos θζ,l
α |0⟩+ sin θζ,l
α |1⟩for some appropriately chosen θζ,l
α
(and likewise for
some appropriately chosen θs for the local term). This has cost brot if implemented up to brot bits. Let
f(µ) = 21−µ for the s = −1 local term and f(µ) = 1 otherwise. The next steps are elucidated below:
