Hyperparameters:
Hyperparameters play a crucial role in determining the stability
and efficiency of model training. The following strategies are recommended:
• Experimentation with various learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizers can help
identify the best configurations.
• Monitoring training instability, often caused by inappropriate hyperparameters such
as excessively high learning rates, can also help with debugging.
Regularization and Generalization:
Debugging regularization techniques such as L2
and dropout ensure that the model maintains a balance between bias and variance. In-
specting layer outputs and gradients, intermediate activations can help diagnose problems
such as vanishing or exploding gradients, which can affect training.
Moreover, modern deep learning frameworks offer robust tools to help in debugging.
For example, TensorBoard is a visualization tool that provides information on loss curves,
metrics, and weight distributions over time, enabling informed adjustments during train-
ing. Debugging deep learning models is a multifaceted process that involves addressing
challenges across data, architecture, and optimization. By leveraging systematic tech-
niques, practical tools, and detailed analysis of loss and metrics, researchers can ensure
that the models achieve robust and reliable performance.
