Thus, we have derived soliton solutions for the ‘two-field’ version of our prob-
lem, consisting of linear Schr¨odinger equations under the bilinear constraint
(2.20).
The last step is to pass from solutions described in Proposition 3.1 to
solution of our problem. We start with imposing some restrictions on the
constants involved to ensure the relations
1r=
1q ∗,
2r=
2q ∗.
(3.20)
It turns out that this can be achieved by taking
Rj = L∗
j,
βja0j = (αjb0j)∗,
j = 1, ..., N.
(3.21)
This, at first, implies EB = E∗
A. Then, after rewriting (3.17) as A0 = DαCDa
and B0 = DβC∗Db, where
C =

1
Lj −L∗
k

j,k=1,...,N
(3.22)
and Dα, Dβ, Da, Db are diagonal matrices with elements αj, βj, a0j, b0j
(j = 1, ..., N) correspondingly, one can reveal the following structure of the
matrices F and G:
F = Dβ (1 + Y∗Y)−1 D−1
β ,
G = Dα (1 + YY∗)−1 D−1
α ,
(3.23)
where
Y = CE,
E = EADβDa.
(3.24)
After some simple calculations, one can rewrite
1q and
2q as
1q= ⟨1|R−1Ω|1⟩,
2q= 1 + ⟨1|(R∗)−1ΩY∗|1⟩
(3.25)
where
Ω= E (1 + Y∗Y)−1
(3.26)
and
⟨1| = (1, ..., 1) ,
|1⟩= (1, ..., 1)T .
(3.27)
Looking at (3.25) one can note that
1q and
2q are solitons of different type:
1q is a so-called bright soliton, vanishing as x →±∞(with t being fixed),
while
2q is a dark soliton (limx→±∞|
2q | = 1). However, this does not mean
that this is true for any solution, because of the fact that both the equations
and constraints are invariant under transformations q →Uq, if U†U = 1. So,
general N-soliton solution is a mixture of dark and bright solitons.
Now, we have all necessary to formulate the main result of this paper.
