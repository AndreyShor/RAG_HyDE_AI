Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 lack lattice strain. This comparison underscores the critical
role of lattice strain in enhancing Jc. Although both NbScTiZr and (Nb,Zr,Pt)67Ti33
exhibit a eutectic microstructure, the former demonstrates superior Jc perfor-
mance. In (Nb,Zr,Pt)67Ti33, lattice strain is not detected[91], whereas signiﬁcant
strain is observed in NbScTiZr. Thus, comparing these two HEAs further high-
lights the pivotal role of lattice strain. While the low-ﬁeld Jc (1 < µ0H < 2 T) of
(TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 at 2 K is an order of magnitude lower than that of heat-treated
Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6, it exhibits relatively higher Jc values at higher ﬁelds (µ0H
> 3 T), attributed to the ﬁshtail eﬀect. At 4.2 K, the Jc of NbScTiZr annealed at
400 ◦C surpasses all other bulk HEAs within the measured ﬁeld range. At 2 K, the
Jc of 400 ◦C-annealed NbScTiZr attains the highest value between 0 and 4 T among
bulk HEAs but declines in comparison to (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 at ﬁelds above 4 T.
These comparative evaluations highlight the potential of eutectic HEA superconduc-
tors to achieve high Jc values. Lattice strain is detected in (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 and
NbScTiZr, contributing to the enhancement of Jc at lower ﬁelds. The ﬁne eutec-
tic microstructure in NbScTiZr, featuring an abundance of grain boundaries, further
enhances low-ﬁeld Jc, making it the highest-performing bulk HEA in this regard. In the
