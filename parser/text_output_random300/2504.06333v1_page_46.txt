Identifying the Z2 ×Z2 part of this symmetry as trivially-acting gives the following
decomposition, where we let x, y and z stand in for any of a, b and c:
Z1
1,1 →Z1,1,
Zx
1,x →Z1,1,
Zx
x,1 →Z1,1,
Z1
x,x →Z1,1,
Zz
x,y →−Z1,1,
(7.23)
Zm
1,m →2Z1,g,
Zm
m,1 →2Zg,1,
Z1
m,m →2Zg,g,
Zm
x,m →−2Z1,g,
Zm
m,x →−2Zg,1,
Zx
m,m →−2Zg,g.
As in the Rep(D4) case we have ﬁxed the coeﬃcients by demanding consistency
with the completely trivially-acting case described in [25, Section 5.4.3]. Plugging
(7.23) into (7.22) produces four copies of a Z2 orbifold, which matches expectations
given the four anyon overlap between (7.13) and (7.21).
Now let us select instead one of the algebras which leads to an igSPT phase;
for concreteness, take (7.18) as the physical boundary algebra. We should expect
to ﬁnd decomposition relations which mirror (7.23) up to modiﬁcations from non-
trivial anyon braiding.
The trivially-acting Z2 × Z2 symmetry is now given by
{([1],1),([1],a),([−1],b),([−1],c)}, and we see that ([−1],b) and ([−1],c) have
non-trivial braiding with the m line, which is given by ([1],m). In decomposing
the partial traces which mix b and m or c and m, then, we will acquire additional
signs from this braiding, much like the Rep(D4) case. The net result is that the
decomposition relations (7.23) become
Z1
1,1 →Z1,1,
Zx
1,x →Z1,1,
Zx
x,1 →Z1,1,
Z1
x,x →Z1,1,
Zz
x,y →−Z1,1,
(7.24)
Zm
1,m →2Z1,g,
Zm
m,1 →2Zg,1,
Z1
m,m →2Zg,g,
Zm
a,m →−2Z1,g,
Zm
m,a →−2Zg,1,
Za
m,m →−2Zg,g,
Zm
b,m →2Z1,g,
Zm
m,b →2Zg,1,
Zb
m,m →2Zg,g,
Zm
c,m →2Z1,g,
Zm
m,c →2Zg,1,
Zc
m,m →2Zg,g.
Now, when plugging into (7.22), the g-twisted contributions all cancel and we are
left with two copies of the parent theory partition function. As expected, then, the
anomalous Z2 does not show up in the result, and the full Rep(Q8) is gaugeable.
If we had instead selected (7.19) or (7.20) as our physical boundary condensable
algebra, we would have found the same end result, with the signs shuﬄed to
diﬀerent partial traces. Note that in each case we expect a decomposition into two
universes, given that (7.18), (7.19) and (7.20) have two anyons each overlapping
with (7.13). It is also not surprising that we would ﬁnd three igSPT phases in
Rep(Q8), given that there is an outer automorphism mixing i, j and k – we
expect this to translate into an exchange symmetry between a, b and c. In D4,
by contrast, only x and xy are equivalent by outer automorphism, which leads to
asymmetry in Rep(D4)’s own a, b and c – this eﬀect is encoded in the associator.
From the algebraic perspective, following the remark around Equation (6.62)
in Section 6.5.1, to deduce a Vec(Z2,α) anomaly resolution by Rep(Q8) we simply
