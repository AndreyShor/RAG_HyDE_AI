To further illustrate the characteristics of each test case, Table 1 summarizes the type
of data, nature of flow, and Reynolds number for each scenario. The shape of the dataset
is presented in the format (nvar, nx, ny, nz, nt), where for the 2D case the spatial resolution
is defined by nx and ny, and for the 3D case nz represents the resolution in the spanwise
direction along with nx, ny, and nt representing temporal snapshots.

Selection of Modes
Choosing the correct number of modes is crucial as they capture the dominant flow struc-
tures while discarding irrelevant noise. The selection is based on the decay of singular
values, ensuring that only the most relevant modes are retained for reconstruction. For
laminar datasets, selecting 8-12 modes provided an optimal balance, with 10 modes chosen
for the predictions. In the case of the turbulent dataset, 4-6 modes worked best, and 5
modes were used. Figure 10 presents the singular values versus modes curves for the three
cases.
In the 2D cylinder case, all significant flow dynamics can be represented by approxim-
ately 30-40 modes. Beyond this range, the singular values drop to (10âˆ’8), which corres-
ponds to machine errors. These low-amplitude modes primarily capture spatial redund-
ancies or numerical noise originating from the CFD simulations. Thus, selecting 8-12
modes is justified, as the singular values within this range are still large enough to retain
the dominant coherent structures of the flow. This selection ensures that the primary
flow dynamics are well-reconstructed with minimal error. The same can be observed for
