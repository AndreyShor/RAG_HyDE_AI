state with spin-parity JP = 1/2−, while the Pc(4440) and Pc(4457) can be interpreted as two
degenerate narrow D
∗Σc bound states with JP = 1/2−& 3/2−, respectively [6–8]. Moreover, a
DΣ∗
c bound state with JP = 3/2−referred to as Pc(4380), which is different from the broad one
reported by LHCb in 2015, and three D
∗Σ∗
c bound states with JP = 1/2−, 3/2−& 5/2−are also
expected to exist, based on heavy quark spin symmetry [9–12]. The successful interpretation of
these hidden-charm Pc states as the hadronic molecules inspires us to investigate their strange
partners.
In the strange sector, S-wave KΣ∗molecule N(1875)3/2−, S-wave K∗Σ molecules N(2080)1/2−& 3/2−
and S-wave K∗Σ∗molecules N(2270)1/2−, 3/2−& 5/2−are proposed as the strange partners of Pc
molecular states [13–18]. In Refs. [15, 18], their decay patterns have been calculated using an effec-
tive Lagrangian approach. Notably, in the most recent Particle Data Group(PDG) review [19], the
two-star N(2080) listed before the 2012 review has been split into two three-star states: N(1875)
and N(2120). For consistency with our previous work, we retain the designation N(2080)3/2−for
the possible K∗Σ molecule, which is not necessarily identified with the N(2120) resonance in the
PDG review. Furthermore, the contentious state N(1535)1/2−can also be interpreted as a bound
state of KΛ, KΣ within the molecular picture [14, 20–23].
We have conducted several studies to investigate the effects of these hidden-strange molecules
in photoproduction reactions. In Refs. [16, 17], the N(2080)3/2−and N(2270)3/2−are introduced
in s-channel as the primary contributors to the γp →K∗+Σ0/K∗0Σ+ and γp →ϕp reactions.
The theoretical models constructed based on this fit well with the available experimental data for
these reactions. Following this, we observe that the differential cross-section data for γp →K+Σ0
from CLAS 2010 [24] exhibits bump structures near the center-of-mass energies W = 1875, 2080
and 2270 MeV, as shown in Fig. 3, corresponding to the Breit-Wigner masses of N(1875)3/2−,
N(2080)1/2−& 3/2−and N(2270)1/2−, 3/2−& 5/2−. Additionally, the KΣ channel is essential in
the molecular picture of N(1535)1/2−[23]. These prompt us to focus on the γp →K+Σ0 and
γp →K0Σ+ reactions to test the effects of these seven hidden-strange molecules mentioned above.
The KΣ photoproduction reactions have garnered significant attention both experimentally
and theoretically over the past few years, contributing to the study of the light baryon resonance
spectrum. In the experimental aspect, various collaborations such as CLAS, SAPHIR, LEPS have
contributed large and diverse sets of experimental data on both cross-sections and polarization
observables for the reaction γp →K+Σ0 [24–33]. With the exception of some older measurements,
these data generally show no significant discrepancies.
For the reaction γp →K0Σ+, several
collaborations such as SAPHIR, CBELSA, A2 have also provided the experimental data [34–39],
