The neutrino mass matrices
We introduce three right-handed neutrinos N1,N2 and N3, and put them on each fixed point
I, II, III, separately (see Table 1).
Their Z2 charges are the same as 10’s. Therefore, N1,2,3
have (−, +, +). The heavy Majorana mass matrix is real diagonal as the up-type quark mass
matrix. The Dirac mass matrices for the neutrinos, MD, are given by the same forms of the
texture of the charged lepton mass matrices in Eqs. (7), (8) and (9), but the parameters of the
matrix elements are different except for the phases ϕ and ϕ′ [3].
The neutrino mass matrix is given by the seesaw mass formula Mν ≃MD(1/MN)M t
D [6–9],
where MN is the diagonal right-handed Majorana mass matrix, and hence we have additional
unknown parameters, that is, M1, M2, M3. However, we absorb the 1/√Mi in the Dirac mass
matrix MD and hence the number of free parameters in the neutrino mass matrix Mν is nine.
The redefined Dirac mass matrices for the each types are written as
