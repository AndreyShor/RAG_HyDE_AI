the superconducting regime, and reemerges near the superconducting crit-
ical temperature (T ∼Tc).
The hysteresis magnitude and coercive fields
strongly depend on the magnetic field sweep rate (dB/dt) and exhibit tran-
sient relaxation in time-series measurements.
Notably, similar hysteresis
behavior was observed in the temperature profile of the sample stage, mea-
sured using a calibrated temperature sensor under analogous magnetic field
cycles, suggesting extrinsic thermal origins rather than intrinsic magnetic
ordering.
These findings underscore the importance of carefully distin-
guishing intrinsic and extrinsic effects in resistance hysteresis observed in
mesoscopic van der Waals systems.

Breaking of the sublattice symmetry in two-dimensional materials such as monolayer
graphene leads to the formation of time-reversal symmetric Chern bands at K and K′ val-
leys with equal and opposite non-zero Chern numbers by virtue of a finite mass acquired
by the Dirac bands.1 Twisted moir´e structures such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG)
are a platform to engineer and host bands with non-zero Chern numbers that can be in-
fluenced by strong electron-electron interaction effects when the bands become extremely
flat.2–5 Breaking of the time-reversal symmetry of such Chern bands under strong interac-
tions6 can lead to the formation of Chern insulators with the signature of quantized anoma-
lous Hall effect (QAH)7,8 and emergent ferromagnetism with anomalous Hall effect.9–14 In
