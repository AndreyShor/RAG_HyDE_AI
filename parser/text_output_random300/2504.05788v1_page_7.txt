presents the other key result. In Fig. 4(e) (I) and (II),
we plot the LDOS from the left and right contacts
(LDOSL and LDOSR) at an energy just below the
first resonance peak [the arrow in Fig. 4(d)-I], revealing
coupling between mode 2 of the 1DEGs and the first
bound state of 0DEG. These 3D plots indicate how
the leakage of LDOS from the right and left contacts
contributes to the total electron density given by

Fig. 4(f) displays LDOSL
at the resonance peaks in the 0DEG area.
The 3D
distributions match the FE-calculated bound states
(Fig. 4(c)), but with the presence of energy shifts. The
broadening effect becomes more pronounced [peak 5 in
Fig. 4(d)] when the bound states misaligned with the
cross-sectional modes in the 1DEG (Fig. 4(f)-V).
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have proposed a cell-centered Finite-
Volume implementation of the NEGF approach (FV-
NEGF) for modeling quantum transport in low-
dimensional devices. The most significant advantage of
the FV-NEGF method lies in its exceptional simplicity
when applied to quantum transport problems in 3D
domains.
Our approach inherently accommodates
nonuniform meshes, making it particularly suitable
for mesoscopic systems.
Furthermore, we establish
a
connection
between
the
mesoscopic
FV-NEGF
framework and the microscopic tight-binding NEGF
(TB-NEGF) method.
This new implementation
is particularly promising for modeling disordered
systems, as it incorporates material properties into
quantum transport by assigning material constants to
the centers of FV cells and strictly enforcing local
conservation laws. We validate the FV-NEGF method
through two representative examples that would be
challenging to implement using conventional FD/FE-
NEGF methods.
Although we did not explore fully
coupled self-consistent Poisson-NEGF simulations in
this work, we are confident that the FV-NEGF method
would perform successfully in such scenarios.
The
possible self-consistent approach enables the use of
a unified mesh for both the NEGF and Poisson
equations, making consistent numerical treatment.
