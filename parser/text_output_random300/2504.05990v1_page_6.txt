Figure 2: Conceptual overview of the medical imaging ‘big data’ health disparities (HD) platform for (a) the 
repurposing of ‘normal’ images for continuous monitoring of HDs and (b) an additional data source for HD 
research. 
 
In this paper, we report our efforts to create a medical imaging-based platform (probe + 
dashboard) to support HD researchers. We demonstrate and evaluate the feasibility of our proposed 
HD probe, using medical images as data sources for HD indices and focusing on the initial use-
case of data computer-extracted from chest radiographic images.

Methods 
2.1 Dataset  
A retrospective dataset of de-identified and HIPAA-compliant chest radiographs from 
1,571patients had been collected under IRB approval from our institution. For each patient there 
were two types of radiographs: one standard chest radiograph image and one soft tissue radiograph 
image, which had been calculated using a ClearRead bone suppression algorithm (Riverain Tech). 
The images had been acquired between January 30, 2020 and February 3, 2021. At the time of 
imaging, all patients had tested negative for COVID-19 and were deemed ‘normal’ for the 
purposes of this study. Demographic information of sex and race was collected from the clinical 
records and served as SDOH phenotype demographic correlates in this study since SDOH
