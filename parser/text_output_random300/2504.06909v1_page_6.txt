Hartmann 2018), convectively coupled waves (Frierson 2007), and the annual cycle of the tropical
tropopause layer (Jucker and Gerber 2017).
Here, we use the idealized configuration described above because it constitutes a relatively simple
framework that nevertheless takes into account key feedbacks linking surface temperature and the
water cycle to changes in large-scale circulation. The strategy we adopt is to impose a superrotating
state by prescribing in the upper troposphere eddy zonal momentum fluxes with the following form:
F = 𝐹0 exp
 
−1
2

𝜙
𝜙scale
2!
exp
 
−1

 𝑝−𝑝0
𝑝scale
2!
e𝑥,
(1)
where 𝜙scale = 5◦, 𝑝0 = 300 hPa, 𝑝scale = 100 hPa and e𝑥is the zonal unit vector. We vary the
strength of the prescribed torque through the 𝐹0 parameter, from 0 to 4 m.s−1.day−1, so as to
force a transition into a state of equatorial superrotation. The precise mechanisms generating
such eddy fluxes are not the focus of this study, but previous work has illustrated cases where eddy
momentum flux convergence was generated by zonally asymmetric diabatic heating (Kraucunas and
Hartmann 2005; Arnold et al. 2012; Lutsko 2018), by a low-latitude mixed barotropic-baroclinic
instability (Williams 2003), or by a Kelvin-Rossby instability (Mitchell and Vallis 2010; Potter
et al. 2014; Zurita-Gotor and Held 2018; Zurita-Gotor et al. 2022; Zurita-Gotor and Held 2024).
b. Forcing/feedback framework
We run several experiments with the model described above and interactive SSTs: a control run,
with 𝐹0 = 0 m.s−1.day−1, as well as forced runs with unit increments of 𝐹0 up to 𝐹0 = 4 m.s−1.day−1
(we will mostly focus on the 𝐹0 = 0 and 𝐹0 = 4 m.s−1.day−1 experiments). Analogous runs but
with fixed SSTs are also performed: in those cases, we prescribe time-averaged SSTs from the
control run. The fixed-SST experiments are run in order to diagnose the radiative forcing induced
by the prescribed superrotation, in the standard way described for instance by Dessler and Zelinka
(2015). In particular, our aim is to decompose the changes in TOA radiation into forcing and
feedback components, which can each be broken down into contributions from different physical
