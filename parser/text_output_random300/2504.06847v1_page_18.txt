This anomalous dispersion behaviour gives rise to anomalous interference colours of crystal 
samples, which are visible in a polarization microscope between crossed polarizers.  
Due to the anomalous dispersion of the refractive indices, a strong wavelength-dependent 
variation is also found for the angle between the optic axes 2V, which increases from 125° at 
400 nm to 180° at 1065 nm at the point of uniaxiality (i.e., 2V = 180° - 2V = 0) of the crystal, 
see Fig. 14a. This dispersion of the optic axes is clearly visible in an interference figure 
(conoscopic illumination in a polarizing microscope) between crossed polarizers along the 
acute bisectrix, which is the direction of 
0
1e in the case of 2-AmpH2PO3, see inset of Fig. 14a. 
On the other hand, the orientation of the principal axes of the optical indicatrix of 2-AmpH2PO3 
is rather fixed with respect to the frame of the axes {
ie } and of the crystallographic axes, with 
a small variation between  = 42.6° at 400 nm and  = 41.5° at 1080 nm, see Fig. 14b. 
From the refractive indices and their dispersion possibilities for collinear phase matching for 
SHG were analysed within the transparency range of 2-AmpH2PO3. The crystals allow both, 
type I and type II phase matching (where type I refers to ss-f interaction, with s = slow wave 
and f = fast wave, and type II to sf-f interaction). A stereographic projection (i.e. a Hobden plot 
[65]) of collinear SHG phase matching loci for selected wavelengths in crystals of 2-
AmpH2PO3 is given in Fig. 15. 
 
3.7. SHG measurements and determination of SHG tensor coefficients of 2-AmpH2PO3 
The performed SHG powder measurements for the non-centrosymmetric 2-AmpH2PO3 
samples yielded (powdered KDP used as reference material) a relative SHG efficiency d(2-
AmpH2PO3) = 1.18 d(KDP) for 800 nm laser irradiation. The phase purity of the polycrystalline 
samples prepared was controlled by powder X-ray diffraction (diffraction data are included in 
Table S2, Supplementary material). A qualitative check for the phase-matchability of the 
compound was performed using particle-size-dependent measurements. The particle-size 
dependence of the SHG signal (see Fig. 16) indicates the phase-matchability of 2-AmpH2PO3. 
This result confirms the expected SHG phase matching calculated based on the determined 
refractive indices (see Chapter 3.6.). Moreover, the optical damage threshold was determined 
for the polycrystalline sample (150-100 m fraction) using 800 nm and 1000 nm laser lines. The 
studied material was stable up to the highest achievable peak laser power for our experimental 
setup, which was 220 TWm-2 and 70 TWm-2 for 800 nm and 1000 nm irradiation, respectively.
