The significantly smaller VCEC value compared to VCMA limits the feasibility of bipolar 
switching in our devices (Supplementary Section 2). The reduced VCEC strength may result 
from limited interlayer coupling or non-uniform voltage distribution in the current device 
structure. Further enhancement could be realized by optimizing the spacer layer and improving 
the crystalline quality of the MgO barrier. Notably, the observed loop shift cannot be attributed 
to STT, as: (1) it exhibits a linear dependence on the applied voltage, and (2) in STT-driven 
switching, a positive current favors the AP state, contradicting the observed behavior. Fig. 2(d) 
shows that VCEC strength scales approximately linearly with MTJ diameter, with smaller 
devices exhibiting weaker effects. This trend likely arises from pillar boundary effects, where 
the intact central area is proportional to S/D ~ d, where S is the pillar area, D is the perimeter, 
and d is the diameter. The VCMA strength, expressed as the effective field per volt, does not 
exhibit a clear trend with size due to the variability in coercivity (Supplementary Section 2). 
Rapid Speed of the VCEC Effect 
 
To investigate the response of the pMTJ under an ultrafast pulse, we implemented the circuit 
in Fig. 3(a). DC bias current of 5 nA was applied via the DC port of bias T to continuously 
monitor resistance after each pulse, while ultrafast pulses were injected through the AC port. 
 
FIG. 3 | VCEC and VCMA induced effective magnetic field. (a) Schematic of the ultrafast pulse switching test 
setup. The pulse generator applies voltage pulses to the MTJ, while the current source reads out the MTJ state using a 
small DC current. (b) Test sequence for switching probability evaluation. The MTJ is first reset to the AP state using 
an external magnetic field. A perturbation voltage pulse from the pulse generator induces VCMA and VCEC effects 
in the MTJ. A small constant current is applied continuously to monitor the MTJ state after each perturbation. (c) 
Minor loop of the 150 nm MTJ. The reference line indicates the applied external magnetic field used in the subsequent 
fast switching test. (d) Switching probability as a function of pulse width, with the pulse amplitude fixed at 3.56 V.
