Abstract: This review provides an overview of defects in silicon carbide (SiC) with potential applications 
as quantum qubits. It begins with a brief introduction to quantum qubits and existing qubit platforms, 
outlining the essential criteria a defect must meet to function as a viable qubit. The focus then shifts to 
the most promising defects in SiC, notably the silicon vacancy (VSi) and divacancy (VC-VSi). A key challenge 
in utilizing these defects for quantum applications is their precise and controllable creation. Various 
fabrication techniques, including irradiation, ion implantation, femtosecond laser processing, and focused 
ion beam methods, have been explored to create these defects. Designed as a beginner-friendly resource, 
this review aims to support early-career experimental researchers entering the field of SiC-related 
quantum qubits. Providing an introduction to defect-based qubits in SiC offers valuable insights into 
fabrication strategies, recent progress, and the challenges that lie ahead.

1. Introduction 
Quantum technologies are poised to revolutionize computing, communication, and sensing by harnessing 
the principles of quantum mechanics. At their foundation lie quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in 
superposition states, enabling vastly enhanced computational capabilities compared to classical bits [1]. 
Various physical systems have been explored for qubit realization, including trapped ions, 
superconducting circuits, and semiconductor-based defect centers [2,3]. Among these, solid-state defects 
in wide-bandgap semiconductors have attracted significant attention due to their long spin coherence 
times, optical addressability, and compatibility with established semiconductor fabrication techniques [4]. 
Silicon carbide (SiC), a wide bandgap semiconductor, stands out as a promising host material due to the 
variety of its point defects. These point defects are commonly referred as optically active defects or color 
centers, and all those names will be used in this paper. 
 The pioneering work and understanding of color centers started with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in 
diamond [5,6,7,8]. However, color centers in SiC present notable advantages, including compatibility with 
wafer-scale production, precise doping control, integration with mature complementary metal-oxide 
semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and access to well-established nanofabrication processes. Among 
various color centers in SiC, the Si vacancy (VSi) and the divacancy (Vc-VSi) are the most studied 
[9,10,11,12,13].  
A critical requirement for the successful implementation of SiC-based quantum technologies is the 
controlled introduction and manipulation of point defects. Various techniques have been developed to 
create and stabilize these defects, including ion implantation, neutron irradiation, and femtosecond laser 
processing [14,15,16,17,18]. Radiation-induced defects, in particular, are of great interest due to their
