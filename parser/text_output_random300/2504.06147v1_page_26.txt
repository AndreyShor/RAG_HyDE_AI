chose a gauge such that the correct asymptotics for bCt0t0t0 are produced (as in (3.14)) after making
the transformation (3.16). There is no guarantee that this gauge leads to the correct asymptotics
for bCt∞t∞t∞. So

The necessary division by η2 is the gauge transformation Ω7→η−1Ω, and since the genus-g free
energy transforms with K¨ahler weight 2 −2g, one arrives at (3.13).
An equivalent characterisation of η is in terms of the integral symplectic bases Π(LV ) and Π(H) of
periods, built from the Frobenius periods about each MUM point and the corresponding mirror
geometric data, as reviewed in the following subsection. A transfer matrix eT will relate the two
bases via Π(H) = eTΠ(LV ). eT will not be an integral symplectic matrix. However, it can be written
eT = 1
ηT,

where T is a symplectic matrix with unit determinant and integer entries.

N = 1 MUM points
These MUM points can be thought of informally as the “ordinary MUM points”, for which the
analyses of [27, 29] hold. Since in our model the point φ = 0 is such an N = 1 MUM point (by
design, as we constructed Y as the mirror to the smooth family Y ), we will here use the symbol Y
to denote the mirror geometry associated to an N = 1 MUM point in general, and not write the
superscript (Y ) on κ111 and c2.

The topological data of the manifold Y can be used to create a change of basis matrix that we
write as a product of two matrices M and ρ. This matrix Mρ has the property that upon circling
a singularity in the φ-plane, the vector of functions Mρϖ transforms by a symplectic matrix with
integer entries. These matrices are
