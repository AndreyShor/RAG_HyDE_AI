to perform the time integral without any simpliﬁcation of special functions. Nonetheless,
before the exponential ampliﬁcation, the generated magnetic ﬁeld is too small to be com-
patible with observations. Thus, we can safely calculate the transfer function using the
asymptotic form of I−1

The scalar ﬁeld φ after the tachyonic phase behave similarly to a cold dark matter
(CDM). In order to be consistent with the standard ΛCDM paradigm, we require the
scalar ﬁeld φ to constitute part of the CDM, that is r ≡ρφ/ρCDM ≤1. Noting that,
after the tachyonic phase r remains constant or decreases if ̺T ≫M. Thus the condition
becomes r(T2) ≤1,
