The control run (Fig. 1, panel a) exhibits the main characteristics of Earth’s current atmospheric
circulation, with some discrepancy due to the idealized setup.
The meridional circulation is
reasonably close to annual-mean observations, except that it is hemispherically symmetric by
construction. Additionally, the two zonal jets are slightly narrower than observed or simulated
in more realistic models, and the maximum wind speed in each jet is significantly stronger and
reached at slightly higher altitude (this is a common property of aquaplanet experiments).
As the prescribed torque increases, we observe a transition to a state of superrotation (Fig. 1,
panel b). This state is characterized by westerly winds over almost the entire atmosphere (except
weak easterlies in the subtropics close to the surface), and a strong zonal jet of approximately
120 m.s−1 at the equator, about twice the speed of the mid-latitude jets in the control run. The
mean meridional circulation also undergoes major changes in its structure.
The Hadley cell
completely disappears, broken up into multiple smaller cells with weaker circulations; the mass
meridional streamfunction decreases by an order of magnitude in the tropics. A residual Ferrell
cell remains, albeit significantly weaker than in the control run and pushed poleward by about 20◦.
Simulations for intermediate values of 𝐹0, between 1 and 3 m.s−1.day−1, demonstrate that this
transition is abrupt: the strength of the equatorial jet does not increase smoothly with the forcing
amplitude but appears suddenly at 𝐹0 = 3 m.s−1.day−1.
