Y011 has dropped out. If χ, κ111, c2 are rational, then in order for this matrix to have rational
entries we must choose κ111 = χ/13 = −30/13. Our assumption has led to a non-integral triple
intersection number. Therefore, ϕ = 0 cannot be an N = 1 MUM point.
The argument from topological string theory:
Another argument shows that ϕ = 0 cannot be an N = 1 MUM point. This is independent of our
above monodromy computations, and also independent of our choice of factor 729 in φ = 1/(729ϕ).
If ϕ = 0 was an N = 1 MUM point, then there would be a choice of η in (3.13) such that the
A-model free energies had constant terms given by the formula due to [57, 64, 65], which we display
in (A.11). We have at our disposal the B-model free energy expansions about ϕ = 0 at genera 2,3,
and 4 from (A.24). Let us attempt to find an η such that

The question mark over the equality indicates that we do not claim this is true. Using the explicit
expansions (A.24), the condition (3.31) gives us a different value of η at each genus:

(3.32)
This procedure does consistently return an η, and each such η in (3.32) actually leads to nonintegral
GV invariants from (3.24). Note that if we attempt to solve the three equations in (3.32) for η and
χ(Y ), the only solution is η = χ = 0.

Identifying the smooth deformation
Given the failure described in the previous subsection, we shall assume that ϕ = 0 is an N > 1
MUM point, and attempt to apply the torsion-refined formalism of [4]. We do not yet have any
geometric realisation of a singular threefold in the GLSM at large negative FI parameter, and
proceed solely by making consistency checks with the formulae presented in [4].
We shall use what we know to arrive at a candidate smooth deformation Xdef. We have at our
disposal the genera 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 topological string free energies, which is the highest genus for
which information purely coming from the conifold gap conditions [34] and the MUM point φ = 0
which provides the Castelnuovo vanishing of GV invariants of Y and the constant term in each
expansion about φ = 0. Once we have a candidate Xdef, this will provide us new information with
which to solve the holomorphic anomaly equations at genera beyond 4 and in so doing we make
nontrivial checks of our proposed geometry.
We shall identify a candidate smooth deformation from its classical topological data. We must
obtain the second Chern number c(Xdef)
2
, the scaling η in (3.13), the number of nodes ms, and the
triple intersection number κ(Xdef)
111
. Note that we must have h1,1(Xdef) = h2,1(Y ) = 1. The Euler
characteristic χ(Xdef), and therefore h2,1(Xdef), will be obtained from (3.26) once we know ms.
