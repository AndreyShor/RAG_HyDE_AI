ability to sustain field-enhanced polaron effects. In this configuration, the absorption dips
remain negative over a broader spectral range, underscoring the field-tunable nature of the
optical properties in graphene–substrate heterostructures. These findings suggest that ap-
plying an external electric field is a powerful mechanism to modulate the overall absorption
profile, which is essential for designing active optoelectronic components where dynamic
control of transmission and absorption is required.
As the magnetic field increases, the absorption minima become deeper and shift toward
higher photon energies, consistent with the widening of the polaron-induced energy gap.
This shift is observed in all substrates but is most pronounced in SiO2 and SiC, where the
combination of moderate η and high ℏωSO yields the most substantial polaronic effects. In
contrast, HfO2 again exhibits a relatively modest response due to its lower phonon energy.
With the application of the electric field (Figure 4(b)), the amplitude of the absorption
dip increases, especially for higher B values. This enhancement confirms the synergistic
effect of electric and magnetic fields in amplifying the polaron binding and, consequently,
the nonlinear optical response. In this combined field regime, the total absorption remains
negative over a broader energy range, reinforcing the nonlinear term’s dominance in the
system’s optical response.
Figure 5 presents the variation of the linear relative refractive index as a function of
photon energy for four different polar substrates: h-BN, SiC, SiO2, and HfO2, under varying
magnetic field strengths (B = 0.05, 0.07, and 0.1 T). Panel (a) shows the case without an
applied electric field (F = 0), while panel (b) includes a field of F = 0.3 V/nm.
Without an electric field, the linear relative refractive index exhibits distinct dispersive
features as shown in Figure 5(a), with positive and negative peaks that become more pro-
nounced as the magnetic field increases from 0.05T to 0.1T. These features are signatures
of resonant optical behavior near the polaron-induced transition energy and reflect the un-
derlying modification of the real part of the optical susceptibility due to the formation of
magneto-polarons. The increase in the amplitude of these oscillations with stronger magnetic
