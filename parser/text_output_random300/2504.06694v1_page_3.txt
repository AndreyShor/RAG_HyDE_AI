COMPARISON OF FROBENIUS ALGEBRA STRUCTURES ON CALABI–YAU TORIC HYPERSURFACES

R(f) for the Jacobian algebra, for an element α in the class group of P, we denote the homogeneous
component of R(f) with degree α by R(f)α. If we deﬁne
A(f) =
∞
M
a=0
R(f)aβ,
where β is the anti-canonical class of P, then A(f) is still a subalgebra of R(f), whose multiplication we
denote by •LG.
Now our main question is whether one can promote this algebra structure on A(f) to a Frobenius
algebra structure and moreover construct a non-trivial Frobenius manifold structure. The main diﬃculty
(in the non-isolated and non-compact case) in constructing a Frobenius manifold structure on A(f) lies
in the lack of the higher residue pairing associated to A(f) and its primitive forms; one can not apply
[10]. Since Crit(f) is non-compact, it is not possible to apply the L2-Hodge theoretic method of [11],
either.
Our approach is
(1) to recall Batyrev–Cox’s theorem [3, Theorem 10.13]
A(f) ∼= Hm−1
pr
(X),
which generalizes (1.1)4 (see Theorem 2.5) and induce a trace pairing on A(f) via this iso-
morphism (see Proposition 2.8); this yields what we call the LG (Landau–Ginzburg) Frobenius
algebra and denote by (A(f), •LG, ⟨−, −⟩LG), and equivalently, (Hm−1
pr
(X), •LG, ⟨−, −⟩LG);
(2) to identify it with the CY (Calabi–Yau) Frobenius algebra structure
(Hm−1
pr
(X), •CY, ⟨−, −⟩CY)
on Hm−1
pr
(X) (see Deﬁnition 2.1), which has been proved to extend to a formal Frobenius manifold
structure on Hm−1
pr
(X) by Barannikov and Kontsevich [2].
More precisely, we show that two (CY and LG) Frobenius algebra structures are equivalent and simply
transport the Frobenius structure on the CY Frobenius algebra to the LG Frobenius algebra.
Theorem 1.1. Let P be an m-dimensional simplicial Gorenstein toric Fano variety with a toric homoge-
neous coordinate ring S = C[z1, . . . , zr]. Let f ∈S be a polynomial of degree given by the anti-canonical
divisor β of P, deﬁning a smooth Calabi–Yau hypersurface Xf in P. Assume that the map
Hm−2(P)
∪[X]
−−−→Hm(P)
(1.2)
is an isomorphism, where [X] ∈H2(P) denotes the cohomology class of X = Xf(C). Then the Landau–
Ginzburg Frobenius algebra (Hm−1
pr
(X), •LG, ⟨−, −⟩LG) is isomorphic to the Calabi–Yau Frobenius alge-
bra (Hm−1
pr
(X), •CY, ⟨−, −⟩CY).
Based on Theorem 1.1, we can transport the formal Frobenius manifold structure on the CY side
to the LG side and deduce the existence of a formal Frobenius manifold structure on A(f) extending
(A(f), •LG, ⟨−, −⟩LG) ∼= (Hm−1
pr
(X), •CY, ⟨−, −⟩CY):
Corollary 1.2. There exists a formal non-trivial Frobenius manifold structure on A(f) which extends
the Frobenius algebra (A(f), •LG, ⟨−, −⟩LG).
We brieﬂy explain the structure of the article. In Section 2, we explain two Frobenius algebra structures
on Hm−1
pr
(X): the CY Frobenius algebra structure in Subsection 2.1 and the LG Frobenius algebra
structure in Subsection 2.2. In Section 3, we compare these two Frobenius algebra structures (Theorem
1.1) and provide its application (Corollary 1.2). In Subsection 3.1, we present the crucial result required
for the proof of Theorem 1.1. In Subsection 3.2, we prove main results. In Subsection 3.3, we deduce
Corollary 1.2. Finally, in Subsection 3.4, we compare it with the case of isolated singularities and provide
a nontrivial example in which P has Picard rank 2 and Crit(f) is non-isolated and non-compact.

4When P = Pr−1, the anti-canonical class β of Pr−1 is OPr−1(r) which corresponds to the integer r under the
isomorphism Cl(Pr−1) ∼
= Z.
