are computed coherently, accumulating the amplitude associated to a given chemical species in an
auxiliary register. This amplitude, which carries information about a specific reaction rate, is recon-
structed via amplitude estimation. We have validated that this procedure works well with a restricted
classical dynamical simulation. Ensemble averaging over initial conditions is performed coherently via
amplitude amplification, so that information is extracted at Heisenberg scaling.
In summary, we present an end-to-end algorithmic framework for optimized simulation of quantum chemical
dynamics. In the conventional chemical modeling parlance, we put forth a trajectory-less approach evolving
the entire wavefunction under exact, non-Born-Oppenheimer dynamics up to a controlled, user-specified
precision, with polynomial space (qubits) and time (gates) cost. As well as proposing novel solutions, we
present detailed implementations and compute the dominant cost of the routines we use. The results are
showcased in Sec. 2.4 for a sequence of increasingly challenging applications. Our study provides evidence
that algorithms for time dynamics are likely to become a complementary to energy estimation algorithms in
quantum chemistry. However, we note that these algorithms have not yet been the subject of a concerted
optimization effort like those for ground state energy estimation, and so expect that further cost reductions
are possible in the future. Furthermore, we stress that performing exact time evolution is substantially more
challenging on classical machines, and so FTQC may provide a unique scientific advantage already with
rather small problem instances. In specific instances (e.g. charge migration in C2HI) one can find an efficient
matrix-product state description which recovers the results of full configuration-interaction calculations up to
a small error [61], but these approaches are fundamentally limited to small correlation regimes. In a general
setting, strongly correlated states that might occur during bond reconfiguration/charge transfer, especially
when considering photochemistry, are expected to be challenging to capture even with such state-of-the-art
classical methods. Our FTQC algorithm can address these challenging cases.

Designing in-silico quantum dynamical simulation of chemical re-
actions
In this overview, we begin by discussing the dynamical degrees of freedom and the Hamiltonian required
for time-evolution (Sec. 2.1). We then discuss how to construct a tunable and physically salient initial state
for simulating reaction mechanisms (Sec. 2.2). Next, we develop a flexible chemical species identification
protocol assisted by classical computational pre-processing for information extraction after time-evolution
(Sec. 2.3). We then propose a sequence of increasingly challenging applications and give a summary of the
corresponding quantum computing resource estimates (Sec. 2.4).

The Hamiltonian in Eq. (1), when expressed in a finite plane-wave basis, can be used to construct block-
encodings, and to implement polynomials of H via quantum signal processing [62], e.g., for the purpose of
implementing time-evolution or eigenstate filtering. The gate complexity will be polynomial in the total
number of particles (η = ηel +ηion) for systems in condensed phase (such as those that involve a metal slab),
specifically O(η8/3) and sublinear dependence in the number of plane-waves |G| in the worst case, when
using a plane-wave basis. While this is still considered efficient, the scaling with η8/3 will lead to a very large
cost in practice. Modeling a typical scenario of a catalytic chemical reaction, involving small molecules and
