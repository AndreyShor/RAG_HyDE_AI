CHARACTERISTICALLY NEAR VECTOR FIELDS
IN THE POLAR COMPLEX PLANE
J.F. PETERS AND E. CUI
Abstract. This paper introduces results for characteristically near vector
fields that are stable or non-stable in the polar complex plane C. All char-
acteristic vectors (aka eigenvectors) emanate from the same fixed point in
C, namely, 0.
Stable characteristic vector fields satisfy an extension of the
Krantz stability condition, namely, the maximal eigenvalue of a stable system
lies within or on the boundary of the unit circle in C.

1. Introduction
This paper introduces proximities of characteristic vector fields that are stable
in the polar complex plane. A dynamical system is a 1-1 mapping from a set of
points M to itself [8, §9.1.1], which describes the time-dependence of a point in a
complex ambient system. In its earliest incarnation by Poincar´e, the focus was on
the stability of the solar system [18]. More recently, dynamical system behaviour
is in the form of varying oscillations in motion waveforms [2, 4]. Typically, vector
fields are used to construct dynamical systems (see, e.g., [19, §4], [5]).
The focus here is on dynamical systems generated by stable characteristic vector
fields (cVfs) in C and their corresponding semigroups. Comparison of cVf character-
istics leads to the detection of proximal cVf semigroups. In general, a characteristic
of an object X is a mapping φ : X →C with values φ(x ∈X) that provide an
