Fig. B.3: Full wavelength range of disentangled spectra and models. The disentangled spectra of the narrow-lined stripped star (dark
blue) and the Be star (orange) are shown across the full wavelength range, scaled to their respective flux contributions. Overlaid are
model spectra with the inferred parameters, plotted as dash-dotted and dashed lines, respectively. The observed spectra, co-added
for improved signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and shifted to the rest frame of the stripped star, are displayed in grey and normalized to
a continuum level of one. Key spectral lines are labeled at the bottom. Narrow, unlabeled features in the Be star’s disentangled
spectrum are spurious, primarily resulting from telluric and interstellar absorption lines, as well as artifacts from the disentangling
process.
tion X = 0.7, Y = 0.28 and Z = 0.02 provided within MESA. We
employ the standard basic.net nuclear network. The evolution
of both binary components is computed, and the models are ter-
minated when the stripped star reaches core-helium depletion,
implemented as a central lower abundance limit of XHe = 0.01.
All of our models assume circular orbits and do not include ro-
tation or related effects (e.g., rotational mixing, rotation-limited
accretion), allowing for a free choice of accretion efficiency. This
simplification is not expected to significantly impact the evolu-
tion of the stripped star—the primary focus of our models (Göt-
berg et al. 2018)—but it introduces substantial uncertainties in
the envelope structure of the fast-rotating companion (e.g., Ra-
machandran et al. 2023). We use the wind mass-loss prescrip-
tion from Reimers et al. (1975) in the low temperature regime
