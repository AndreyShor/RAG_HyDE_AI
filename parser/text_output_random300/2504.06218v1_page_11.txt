The factor eiϕ is included to account for a possible optical
field phase difference between positions 1 and 2 (it plays
no role in transition probability calculations).

Numerical simulation
The energies ei and eigenstates |vi⟩of dressed single
Rydberg atoms are calculated through the numerical
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian H(1) restricted to
the basis B(1)(N).
Similarly, the energies Ei and eigenstates |Vi⟩of a
dressed Rydberg atom-pair, given the inter-atomic dis-
tance R and the polar angle θ, result from the diagonal-
ization of the Hamiltonian H(2) restricted to the basis
B(2)(N). An example of the energy spectrum {Ei} as a
function of the MW frequency is shown in Fig. 6.
In addition, the energies ED

(given {R, θ}) to be employed in the calculation of the

Optical excitation probabilities
For an isolated atom initially in the ground state,
the perturbed state |ψ⟩(1) resulting from the coupling
with the optical excitation was calculated using time-
independent first order perturbation theory. It was used
to determine the transition amplitudes ai ≡⟨vi|ψ⟩(1) and
the transition probabilities pi = |ai|2.

An example of the excitation probability for single
atoms as a function of the MW frequency is shown in
Fig.
10.
Notice the strong decrease of the excitation
probability of 55D levels due to the avoided crossing of
the dressed energies (AT effect) [22, 34]. On the other
hand the excitation probability of level 54F is increased
around the avoided crossing as a consequence of the mix-
ing of D and F states.

In a similar way, the perturbed pair-state |ψ⟩(2)

A typical result for the double excitation probability
for a given pair geometry is illustrated in see Fig.
7.
A strong reduction at ω = ωF D occurs for the Rydberg
excitation probability of |D, D⟩pair states due to the
AT effect mainly regarding the intermediate single-atom
excitation. Also, the excitation probability of |D, F⟩and
|F, D⟩states is maximum at ω = ωF D and spreads over
a broad MW frequency range corresponding to the many
avoided crossings in Fig. 6.
We signal that within the validity of perturbation
theory the single atom excitation probability (fist order
perturbation) is larger than double excitation probability
(second order perturbation) by a factor O(κ2/Ω2
opt).
