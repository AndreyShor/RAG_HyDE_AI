is the Spitzer 8.0 µm image focusing on the central part
of the filamentary structure in absorption (outlined by
the solid box in Figure 1a), where ATL-5 is located.
Overlaid MeerKAT 1.3 GHz continuum emission con-
tours within the inset reveal ionized gas concentrated
around ATL-5, providing evidence of ongoing MSF ac-
tivity within the clump.
The detection of radio con-
tinuum emission is attributed to the higher sensitivity
of the MeerKAT data compared to the MAGPIS data.
We calculated the total flux density of the UC H ii re-
gion (radius ∼0.05 pc) from MeerKAT data above the
5σ threshold to be about 0.37 mJy.
Using this value
and assuming the temperature to be about 104 K, we
determined the total number of Lyman continuum pho-
tons emitted per second (denoted as NUV), following the
equation presented in Matsakis et al. (1976). We found
that log(NUV) ∼44.8 for the driving source of the H ii
region. Comparing our calculated value of NUV with the
theoretical estimation of Panagia (1973), we infer that
the source responsible for ionizing the gas is a B2-type
star.
In the central part of the filamentary structure hosting
N59-North, several pc-scale IR-dark filaments are iden-
tified in the Spitzer 8.0 µm image. These filaments seem
to converge toward a common junction associated with
ATL-5 (see the inset and the solid box in Figure 1a). We
estimated the background/foreground emission in the
Spitzer 8 µm image using the median filtering technique
(see Simon et al. 2006; Ragan et al. 2009, for details)
and found it to be about 70 MJy sr−1 toward ATL-5.
In contrast, the IR-dark filaments associated with ATL-
5 are detected at levels of about 55–65 MJy sr−1. These
values indicate that the IR-dark filaments are not ran-
dom background fluctuations but reliable features, po-
sitioning ATL-5 at the center of a HFS candidate (i.e.,
C-HFS) with an extent of less than 3 pc. The central
hub (or ATL-5) is associated with an UC H ii region.
The identification of the C-HFS is a new and important
result, highlighting the potential of Spitzer 8 µm image
in revealing pc-scale HFSs. Previously, Dewangan et al.
(2024a) identified multiple such HFSs using absorption
features in the Spitzer 8 µm image toward the IRDC
G11.11−0.12 (see also Bhadari et al. 2024).
3.3. Study of 13CO(J = 1–0), 13CO(J = 3–2), and
NH3(1–1) data in the filamentary cloud
We investigate the gas distribution and kinematics in
the filamentary cloud using the the GRS 13CO(J = 1–
0), CHIMPS 13CO(J = 3–2) and RAMPS NH3(1–1) line
data.
3.3.1. Molecular gas morphology and velocity in the
filamentary cloud
Figures 3a and 3b show the moment-0 map and
the intensity-weighted velocity (moment-1) map for the
GRS 13CO(J = 1–0) data, respectively. In Figures 3c
and 3d, we present the moment-0 and moment-1 maps
of the CHIMPS 13CO(J = 3–2) data, respectively. The
moment-0 and moment-1 maps for RAMPS NH3(1–
1) data are shown in Figures 3e and 3f, respectively.
As mentioned in Section 2, CHIMPS 13CO(J = 3–2)
and RAMPS NH3(1–1) data have better resolution and
trace relatively higher-density gas as compared to GRS
13CO(J = 1–0) data. By combining these data sets, we
obtain a comprehensive view of the gas morphology and
velocity across diffuse (≲103 cm−3), intermediate (∼
103 cm−3) and denser (≥104 cm−3) gas components.
Note that Figure 3a is identical to Figure 1c; however,
it has been included in Figure 3 alongside other panels
for ease of comparison.
The 13CO(J = 3–2) and NH3(1–1) moment-0 maps
reveal the filamentary morphology of the higher-density
gas within the extended molecular emission traced in the
13CO(J = 1–0) moment-0 map. Molecular condensa-
tions are traced toward the ATLASGAL clumps in both
13CO(J = 3–2) and NH3(1–1) moment-0 maps. All the
moment-1 maps reveal similar velocities at the opposite
edges of the filament (see clumps ATL-1, ATL-6, ATL-
7).
There are significant velocity variations of a few
km s−1 along the length of the filament, from its edges
toward the center. The lowest velocity is observed to-
ward the central region of the filament, where C-HFS or
ATL-5 is situated. Notably, intense molecular emission
is detected in each moment-0 maps toward the bubble
N59-North, which is associated with ATL-2 (see Fig-
ures 3a, 3c, and 3e). The moment-1 maps indicate that
the molecular gas toward the bubble N59-North (in-
