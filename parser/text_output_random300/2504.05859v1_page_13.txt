Figure 1. Schematics of the device, hot carrier photovoltaics, and pump-probe scheme. 
(a) Schematic of a dual-gated WS2/hBN/MoSe2 heterostructure. WS2 and MoSe2 
monolayers are grounded; top and bottom gate voltages (𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡 and 𝑉𝑉𝑏𝑏) are applied. (b) 
For the pump-probe scheme, only MoSe2 is optically excited, and optical resonances 
of WS2 are probed for monitoring hot-electron extraction dynamics, with varying 
doping and band offsets. (c) The concept of HCSCs. Photoexcited hot electrons and 
holes are collected by the electron ESC (above the conduction band minimum) and the 
hole ESC (below the valence band maximum), respectively. (d) Contour plot of the 
doping dependence of steady RC spectrum with 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸=0 V. (e) Two RC spectra with 
neutral and electron doped MoSe2, extracted from (d). AM, AM
−/+, BM, BM
− represent 
A-exciton, A-exciton-derived Fermi polaron, B-exciton, and B-exciton-derived Fermi 
polaron resonances of MoSe2, respectively. Similar label conventions are applied to 
reflectance resonances of WS2.
