We can also define Hamiltonians3 𝐻QUBO
𝑄
and 𝐻Max-Cut
𝐽
as (where 𝑍𝑖is the Pauli 𝑍applied to qubit 𝐼)
𝐻Q
𝑄=

Which in turn satisfy
⟨𝜓(𝑥)|𝐻Q
𝑄|𝜓(𝑥)⟩= 𝑥𝑇𝑄𝑥,
⟨𝜓(𝑦)|𝐻M
𝐴|𝜓(𝑦)⟩= −1

Now, given the QUBO problem associated with 𝑄, it can be solved by either
• Running QAOA with 𝐻𝐶= 𝐻Q
𝑄.
• Running QAOA with 𝐻𝐶= 𝐻M
𝐴where 𝐴is the adjacency matrix of the corresponding graph of 𝑄.

Methods
3.1
Warm-start Quantum Optimization
Warm-start QAOA refers to using information about the Hamiltonian 𝐻𝐶to determine an appropriate initial
state, |𝜓init⟩.
3.1.1
QUBO-Relaxed. The QUBO-Relaxed warmstart (see [5, 8]) is inspired by the following relaxation of a
QUBO. Given a symmetric 𝑄∈R𝑛×𝑛, let
𝑦𝑐= arg max
𝑦∈[0,1]𝑛𝑦𝑇𝑄𝑦.
(20)
In the event that 𝑄is negative semidefinite, it is known that the above relaxation is convex4 and thus can be
solved efficiently [20]. However, for arbitrary 𝑄, solving the relaxation is known to be NP-Hard [9] meaning
that, unless 𝑃= 𝑁𝑃, there is no algorithm that is guaranteed to find the global optimum in polynomial time.
As discussed later in our numerical results, for general 𝑄, we instead estimate 𝑦𝑐by considering random initial
points in the box [0, 1]𝑛and performing a local optimization.
Given a positive real hyperparameter 𝜀> 0, the QUBO-Relaxed initial state for 𝐻QUBO
𝑄
is given by
|𝜓𝑗⟩= 𝑅𝑌(𝜃𝑗)|0⟩
where
𝜃𝑗=


2 arcsin(𝜀)
if
𝑦𝑐
𝑗≤𝜀
2 arcsin(𝑦𝑐
𝑗)
if
𝜀≤𝑦𝑐
𝑗≤1 −𝜀
2 arcsin(1 −𝜀)
if
𝑦𝑐
𝑗≥1 −𝜀
.

3Here 𝑄and 𝑀refer to QUBO and Max-Cut respectively.
4Technically, the objective is a concave function; however convex optimization is usually considered in the context of minimization problems
and minimization of a convex objective 𝑓is equivalent to maximization of the concave objective −𝑓. In general, we abuse this language
and say that an optimization problem “is convex" whenever a convex objective is being minimized or when a concave objective is being
maximized.
