Deﬁnition 15. A non-local computation game (or NLC-game) of a function
f is a XOR-game G = (X × Y, A × B, π, V ) where V : C × Z →{0, 1},
Z = {x ⊕y|x ∈X, y ∈Y } and V (a ⊕b, x ⊕y) = 1 if a ⊕b = f(x ⊕y).
Linden et al. showed that when considering such a model, neither classical
nor quantum strategies can always win a given game.
Theorem 11. Let G be a non-local computation game. Then
ωC(G) = ωQ(G) < 1

Non-locality Distillation
The motivation behind the study of non-locality distillation is the question
of whether we can use a set of boxes to simulate the behaviour of a more
non-local one. For example, can we use a set of n noisy PR-boxes to simulate
the behaviour of a less noisy PR-box.
Deﬁnition 16. A non-locality distillation protocol (NDP) consists of local
operations performed by Alice and Bob on their respective ends of n boxes
with a given CHSH value to simulate the input-output behaviour of a higher
valued box.
A non-locality distillation protocol N on n boxes P, denoted
N n[P], consists of local operations performed on the boxes to simulate the
input/output behaviour of a box P ′ = N n[P].
Of course, for a distillation protocol to be useful we must have that the
CHSH value of the box simulated by the protocol is greater than the CHSH
value of the input boxes (i.e. CHSH(P ′) > CHSH(P)). However, we do
not require that distillation is achieved for all families of boxes, because as
we will soon see, this would be impossible.

Limits on Distillation Protocols
This section contains upper bounds and impossibilities on non-locality distil-
lation protocol. For example, the ﬁrst statement of theorem 12 asserts that
no distillation protocol can create non-locality from locality. The results of
this theorem were taken from [12].
Theorem 12. For any non-locality distillation protocol N ,
