where, 𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝐺𝑡 , 𝐺𝑚)  represents the covariance between 𝐺𝑡  and 𝐺𝑚 . Specifically, it is calculated as 
𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝐺𝑡 , 𝐺𝑚) =

  (where j and k denote the indices for the y‒z plane, and the sums 
are taken over the appropriate ranges of j and k). Here, 𝐺𝑚  is the mean state of CDA GMOC, 𝐺𝑡  is the 
instantaneous time slice of GMOC, 𝐽0 and 𝐾0 are numbers of points on the y‒z plane, and 𝜎𝐺𝑡 and 𝜎𝐺𝑚 
are the standard deviations of 𝐺𝑡 and 𝐺𝑚, respectively. 
Geostrophic component of GMOC. We calculate the geostrophic GMOC using observed and CDA-
derived ocean temperature and salinity data, and subsequently verified its geostrophic component. The 
following formula for the geostrophic meridional velocity (vg) is derived based on the geostrophic balance and 
thermal wind relationship, which are fundamental in oceanographic studies [61]: 
𝒗𝒈(𝑘) = 𝒗𝒈(𝑘+ 1) −𝑔

where, g is the gravitational acceleration, f is the Coriolis parameter, k is the k-th vertical grid with k increasing 
downwards, z is the grid depth, and σ(k) is the potential density referenced to z(k). The geostrophic velocity is 
reconstructed with the level of no motion at the ocean bottom. Referring to previous research, a small spatially 
uniform velocity O (0.1 mm/s) is removed afterwards to ensure zero meridional transport [62]. 
North Atlantic Deep Water. The NADW index is defined as the average thickness between two isopycnals 
of σ1.5 over the domain of 55°–35° W and 45°–65° N [63,64]. Here, σ1.5 represents the potential density 
referenced to a depth of 1500 m. In this study, we chose σ1.5 = (34.56, 34.68) as the two isopycnals for CESM-
HIS, CESM-CDA, CM2-CDA, ORAS5, and EN4, and σ1.5 = (34.52, 34.56) for CM2-HIS. The differences in 
the isopycnals chosen for different simulations are attributed to the distinct characteristics of deep mode water 
formation and evolution in each model. 
Residual circulation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The ACC-RC denotes the net transport of 
Ekman effects, while being compensated by eddy-induced transport [38]. It reflects the overall balance 
between the direct impact of Ekman effects and the counteracting influence of eddy-induced transport. We 
calculate the ACC-RC from the following formula [65]: 
𝛹∗= −𝜏
𝑓+ 𝐾𝑒𝑆,

where, τ represent wind stress, f is the Coriolis parameter, Ke is eddy diffusivity coefficient, which is set to 
1000 m2/s in this study [66], and S is the slope of isopycnal. Similar to the GMOC index, we define the ACC-
RC index as the linear regression coefficient of the instantaneous time-slice (monthly in this particular case) 
distribution of the ACC-RC system in relation to its temporal mean distribution.
