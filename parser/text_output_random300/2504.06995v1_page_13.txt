FIG. 8. Design expectations for the scanning and pulse generation performance of this device for a range of tunable parameters.
Top Left: Spot size at the focus versus wavelength and magnification factor M = f0
fc . The horizontal line is the magnification
factor for the design discussed in this paper. Top Right: Scan range per degree of MEMS mirror deflection as a function of
OAP focal length and MEMS mirror size, with parameters for this device indicated with a star. Bottom Left: Pulse width for
fixed optics as a function of MEMS mirror parameters, with mirror diameter on the y-axis and the frequency-angle product of
the mirror on the x-axis. The mirror used for these results is shown with a star. The range of mirrors available from Mirrorcle
are shown for reference as black dots. Bottom Right: Pulse width for fixed MEMS mirror, as a function of collimator and
main OAP focal lengths, assuming 10 µm input fiber and 105µm output fiber.
Here again, we find the magnification factor M =
f0
fc ,
meaning that scan range and spot size scale proportion-
ally, for all other system parameters fixed.
For a MEMS mirror with diameter equal to or larger
than the initial collimated beam size, the scan range is
just:
dscan ≈2θdf0 = 4θmf0,
(B10)
which implies that for a setup not limited by the mirror
diameter, we can reduce spot size by increasing the focal
length of the collimating optic.

Pulse Duration
Next, we use the above to compute the effective pulse
duration for a mirror swept across a slit much smaller
than the beam spot. For maximum deflection angle θd,
the mean scan velocity scales as
vbeam = dbeam
t
≈2(f0 −l)θd
t
(B11)
where dbeam is the diameter of the beam at the output fo-
cal length and t is the average transit time for the mirror
to pass through the scan range.
The scan velocity at the center of the beam path de-
pends on the spring constants of the MEMS mirror, mir-
ror mass, and the driving voltage, which we can approxi-
