Resonator Characterization
The transmission spectrum, S21, of a hanger-type resonator employed in the main text is
typically expressed as [1]:
S21(f) = 1 −
Qtot/Qext
1 + 2iQtot(f −fr)/fr
,
(1)
where Qtot = Qint + Qext is the total quality factor, with Qint and Qext representing the
internal and external quality factors, respectively. More sophisticated treatments, which
include impedance mismatch and non-ideal couplings, are introduced and summarized in
Refs. [1–3].
The half-power bandwidth, 2δf ′ (with δf ′ = |f ′−fr| defined by the condition 2|S21(fr)|2 =
|S21(f ′)|2), measured from the bottom of the dip, can be expressed as
2π × 2δf ′ =
κint
q
1 −
2κ2
int
κ2
tot
,
(2)
where κint = ωr/Qint is the internal decay rate, κext = ωr/Qext is the external decay rate,
and κtot = κint + κext is the total decay rate of the resonator. For an overcoupled resonator,
where κext ≫κint, Eq. (2) reduces to κint, indicating that the 3-dB bandwidth from the dip
corresponds to the internal loss.
On the other hand, another half-power bandwidth, 2δf ′′ = 2 |f ′′ −fr| (with 0.5 =
|S21(f ′′)|2), can be related to the external loss as follows:
2π × 2δf ′′ = κext
r
1 + 2κint
κext
.

For an overcoupled resonator, this equation reduces to κext, indicating that 2δf ′′ corresponds
to the external loss of the resonator.
The number of photons in the resonator is calculated as follows based on the procedure
used in Ref [4]. The power dissipated inside the resonator, Ploss, is
Ploss = Pin −Prefl −Ptrans,
(4)
where Pin is the input microwave power, Prefl = |S11|2Pin is the reflected power, Ptrans =
|S21|2Pin is the transmitted power. According to Ref. [3], for a hanger-type resonator,
S11 = −
