Here Q is the permutation such that xQ(1) ≤⋯≤xQ(2n).
Note that H2n is the nothing but the 2n-particle Hubbard
Hamiltonian with imaginary interaction in first quantiza-
tion, and ψ(2n)
t
(x;a) can be regarded as the wave func-
tion for 2n fermions since it is antisymmetric. Thus, we
have reduced our model to the one-dimensional Fermi-
Hubbard model with imaginary interaction.
In the derivation of an exact formula for ψ(2n)
t
(x;a),
we use the Bethe ansatz directly on the infinite lattice,
thereby avoiding formidable tasks required on a finite
lattice—namely, solving the Bethe equations and sum-
ming over the Bethe wave functions.
By utilizing the
Bethe ansatz solutions ϕ(x;a∣z) and E(z) on the infinite
interval, which satisfy H2nϕ(x;a∣z) = E(z)ϕ(x;a∣z), we
obtain the following formula for n = 1 and n = 2,

See Sec.
III of SM [76] for
the basics of the Bethe ansatz for the Fermi-Hubbard
model and Sec. IV for the proof of Eq. (9). We remark
that Eq. (9) for n = 1 has already been obtained in our
previous work [58], and that for n ≥3 is a conjecture.
Exact solution of the variance.— Here we derive the ex-
act expression for σ2
Qt and its asymptotic form for large t
by employing the ω-dependence and the integral formula
for the Green’s function.
As derived in Sec. V of SM [76], we obtain the exact
expression for q1 and q2 as

By combining the above expressions and Eq. (5), we ob-
tain the exact solution of σ2
Qt.
In what follows, we will investigate the large-t behavior
of σ2
Qt. We first consider the case without dephasing, i.e.,
γ = 0. In this case, Ref. [81] and Ref. [9] have exactly
shown ⟨Qt⟩≃2t/π and σ2
Qt ≃log t/2π2 for ρa = 1, ρb =
0, respectively. By combining these results and the ω-
dependence, we have the asymptotic form of σ2
Qt for γ =
0,
σ2
Qt ≃[ρa(1 −ρa) + ρb(1 −ρb)]2t
π + (ρa −ρb)2 log t
2π2 . (12)
The above equation illustrates that the current fluctua-
tion grows ballistically, except for the domain wall initial
condition, namely (ρa,ρb) = (1,0) or (0,1). We remark
that the leading term was already obtained via scattering
theory in Ref. [10].
We next consider the case with dephasing, i.e., γ >
0, and derive the asymptotic form of q1(t) and q2(t).
Although the asymptotic form of q1(t) has been obtained
in our previous work [58], and is given by q1(t) ≃
√
τ/π
with a rescaled time τ ∶= t/2γ, we reproduce this result
using another method, which can be straightforwardly
applied to q2(t).
In Eq. (10), we extend the radius of the z1-contour
from r to 1 −δ where δ is sufficiently small positive con-
stant to avoid poles on the unit circle. This procedure
separates the contribution from the pole inside the unit
circle, which arises from 1/(c1−c2−2γ), and that from the
extended z1-contour. The latter is found to be O(e−4γt)
and is therefore negligible. Thus we have
q1(t) ≃∫Cγ

α2/z2
(1 −α2/z2)2 et˜ε,
(13)
where Cγ is the counterclockwise contour satisfying ∣z2∣=
1 and ∣c2 + 2γ∣> 1, α2 is the position of the pole, and ˜ε2
is defined as ˜ε2 ∶= z2 −1/z2 −α2 + 1/α2 −4γ. Eq. (13) is
now a single-variable integral, to which one can directly
apply the saddle point method, obtaining q1(t) ≃
√
τ/π.
See Sec. VI of SM [76] for the explicit form of α2 and
the details of the saddle point analysis.
In Eq. (13), we have neglected the term for which
∣zj∣= 1 and retained the term arising from the pole of
1/(c1 −c2 −2γ). This can be interpreted as neglecting the
contribution from scattering states while retaining the
contribution from bound states in the Bethe wave func-
tions.
This is because izj corresponds to the rapidity
of the Bethe wave function of the Fermi-Hubbard model,
where the absolute value of the rapidities is unity for scat-
