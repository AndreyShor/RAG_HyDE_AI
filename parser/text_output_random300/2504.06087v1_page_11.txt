Acknowledgements
We greatly appreciate Gunnar Arctaedius’ and Leon
Gerard’s support on prototyping this approach. This
work has been funded by the Austrian Science Fund
FWF Project I 3403, the WWTF Project ICT19-041
and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research
(BMBF) and the Free State of Bavaria under the Ex-
cellence Strategy of the Federal Government and the
L¨ander.
Computations were achieved with the Vi-
enna Scientific Cluster, Leonardo (Project L-AUT 005)
and the Munich Center for Machine Learning Cluster
(MCML) hosted at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre
(LRZ). The funders had no role in study design, data
collection and analysis, decision to publish or prepara-
tion of the manuscript.
Author contributions statement
MS and NG jointly conceived the project, implemented
the approach, ran the experiments, and analyzed the
data.
MS focused on the sparse forward Laplacian,
MCMC, efficient JAX implementation, finding test sys-
tems, and running reference calculations. NG focused
on the architecture, low-rank updates, pseudopoten-
tials, S+ operator, and optimization. MS, NG and PG
wrote the paper.
SG and PG provided funding and
feedback on the manuscript.
