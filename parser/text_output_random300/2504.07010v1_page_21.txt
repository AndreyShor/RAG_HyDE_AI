Figure 3:
Scatter plot between the theoretical Bhattacharyya distance, Â¯dBC
defined in (49), and the density-ratio estimation of dBC, dKL, and dTV ob-
tained for all weights in the first of 5 simulations. All distances were min-max
normalized before computing the correlation. The legend reports the average
correlation and corresponding standard deviations on the 5 equivalent runs.
