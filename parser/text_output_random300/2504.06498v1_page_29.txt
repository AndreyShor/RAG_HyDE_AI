Figure S6: Stacked spectra from quantum oscillators in [15N]-pyridine acquired at varying
feedback delays (𝜏). The external feedback gain was fixed at 𝐺ext = −3000 for all experiments.
Each spectrum corresponds to a 1-minute acquisition, with Fourier transformation applied to the
time-domain data from 5–60 seconds to generate the stacked spectra. The top spectrum shows a
conventional zero-field NMR spectrum of the same sample, for reference.
