in terms of the Lie derivative along the vector ξµ. The above conditions are satisfied by
diffeomorphisms that behave as
ξz(z, x) = −zΩ(x) ,

ξi(z, x) = ℓ2∂jΩ(x)
Z z

z′¯gij(z′, x)dz′ ,
(4.14)
where Ω(x) is an arbitrary function. Due to the asymptotic behavior of ¯gij(z, x), the vector
ξi(z, x) can, in turn, be expanded as
ξi(z, x) =
∞

n=2
znξ(n)i(x) .

As shown in Ref. [65], for diffeomorphisms of the form of Eqs. (4.13) and (4.14), the
variation of ¯gij(z, x) is given by
δ¯gij(z, x) = Ω(x) (2 −z∂z) ¯gij(z, x) + ¯Diξj(z, x) + ¯Djξi(z, x) ,
(4.16)
where ¯Di is the covariant derivative associated to ¯gij. After inserting Eqs. (4.3), (4.15) and
(4.16) in the last expression, the transformation of each term of the FG expansion g(n)

obtained, what reads

As expected, the first term represents the fact that a radial diffeomorphism induces a Weyl
rescaling at the conformal boundary since
δg(0)
ij = 2Ω(x)g(0)

(4.18)
It is interesting to notice that the same behavior is met by g(1)
ij , with a different scaling
factor
δg(1)
ij = Ω(x)g(1)
ij .

This result extends the PBH analysis of Ref.[65] to an AAdS metric with higher-derivative
modes. In an AdS/CFT framework, the fact PBH transformations produce a Weyl rescaling
in g(1)
ij is a reflection that this mode remains unconstrained. This is properly interpreted as
a new holographic source, whose dual operator is the partially massless response function,
introduced in Ref. [58, 68].
In turn, Eq. (4.17) leads to
