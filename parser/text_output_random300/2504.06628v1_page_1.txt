We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates in active matter systems
driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Employing the probability flow equivalence technique,
we rigorously derive an entropy production decomposition formula and demonstrate that the entropy
production, ∆stot, satisfies the integral fluctuation theorem ⟨exp[−∆stot + Bact]⟩= 1 and the
generalized second law of thermodynamics ⟨∆stot⟩≥⟨Bact⟩, where Bact is a path-dependent random
variable associated with the active fluctuations.
Our result holds generally for arbitrary initial
conditions, encompassing both steady-state and transient finite-time regimes. In the limiting case
where active fluctuations are absent (i.e., Bact ≡0), the theorem reduces to the well-established
results in stochastic thermodynamics. Building on the theoretical foundation, we propose a deep
learning-based methodology to efficiently compute the entropy production, utilizing the L´evy score
function we proposed. To illustrate the validity of this approach, we apply it to two representative
systems: a Brownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer system consisting
of an active Brownian particle cross-linker interacting with passive Brownian beads. Our results
provide a unified framework for analyzing entropy production in active matter systems while offering
practical computational tools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behaviors.
Introduction—Fluctuations are intrinsic to many mi-
croscopic systems with Gaussian thermal noise that
forms the foundation of stochastic thermodynamics [1–4].
However, recent advances in active matter systems have
revealed the ubiquitous presence of non-Gaussian fluctu-
ations driven by activity, observed in phenomena such as
stochastic navigation in eukaryotic microorganisms [5],
bacterial run-and-tumble dynamics [6, 7], self-propelling
colloidal particles [8–11], Janus particles [12], molecular
motor-driven transport [13–16], and active living cells
[17–20]. These discoveries have inspired the development
of generalized Langevin equations that incorporate both
thermal and active noise [21–31]. In theory, fluctuations
in active matters are typically studied via two types of
stochastic models [8]. The first utilizes active Ornstein–
Uhlenbeck (OU) processes [32]. The second encompasses
L´evy-type processes, such as compound Poisson [15] and
α-stable L´evy processes [13].
Some key questions in stochastic thermodynamics are
as follows: (i) how to rigorously define and compute en-
tropy production, (ii) how to consistently extend stochas-
tic thermodynamics to systems governed by active fluc-
tuations, and (iii) how active fluctuations influence en-
tropy production and dissipation mechanisms. Address-
ing these questions is crucial for advancing our under-
standing of the thermodynamics of active matter and
for uncovering the fundamental principles underlying
nonequilibrium processes in systems with complex fluc-
tuations. These questions have been explored in [32] for
diffusion systems. However, there are limited references
addressing these issues in systems driven by L´evy-type
active fluctuations. Previous studies on nonequilibrium
heat transport [33–36] and fluctuations under L´evy and
Poisson noise [37–40] have provided valuable insights.
Nevertheless, these works predominantly focus on spe-
cific cases, and a unified theoretical framework for the
stochastic thermodynamics of active systems with non-
Gaussian fluctuations remains largely undeveloped.
In this Letter we address these challenges through
proving a unified fluctuation theorem in non-Gaussian
active matter and providing a deep learning framework to
compute the entropy production. First, using the prob-
ability flow equivalence technique, we rigorously derive
the entropy production decomposition formula:
∆stot = ∆ssys + ∆sm + ∆sact,
(1)
where the total entropy production, ∆stot, is decomposed
into three contributions—the system entropy change
(∆ssys), the medium entropy change (∆sm), and the con-
tribution from active fluctuations (∆sact).
Second, we derive an integral fluctuation theorem for
entropy production by the rigorous stochastic analysis:
⟨e−∆stot+Bact⟩= 1,
(2)
where ⟨· · · ⟩describes the ensemble average over all mi-
croscopic trajectories, and Bact is a path-dependent ran-
dom variable induced by active fluctuations. This result
is valid under general nonequilibrium conditions, encom-
passing both finite-time and steady-state regimes. This
fluctuation relation bears a formal resemblance to the
Sagawa–Ueda relation in information thermodynamics
[41]. Applying Jensen’s inequality to (2), we derive that:
⟨∆stot⟩≥⟨Bact⟩.
