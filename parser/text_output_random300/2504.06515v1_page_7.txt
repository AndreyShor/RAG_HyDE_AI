4. Canonical Formalism for Particle Dynamics
To obtain the ROGS Hamiltonian, the canonical Arnowitt–Deser–Misner (ADM) for-
malism [96–98] can be employed, as with the ADM formalism in (3 + 1)-dimensional
theory. The result of this procedure is that constraints are eliminated, coordinate conditions
are imposed, and the reduced Hamiltonian is given as a spatial integral of the second
derivative of Ψ, which is a function of the dynamical variables (za, pa) of the particles [99].
Consequently, the Hamiltonian is completely determined in terms of the coordinates and
momenta of the particles.
4.1. Neutral Particles
Consider ﬁrst the N-body system whose interactions are purely gravitational. Writing
the metric as
ds2 = −N2
0dt2 + γ

dx + N1
γ dt
2
(16)
its extrinsic curvature is
K = (2N0γ)−1(2∂1N1 −γ−1N1∂1γ −∂0γ) = √γκ(π −Π/γ)
(17)
where π and Π are the respective conjugate momenta to γ and Ψ. Using this, the action
integral (10) can be written as
I =
Z
d2x
(
∑
a
pa ˙zaδ(x −za(x0)) + π ˙γ + Π ˙Ψ + N0R0 + N1R1
)
(18)

where ∂0 is denoted by ( ˙ ) and ∂1 by a symbol ( ′ ).
Performing the canonical reduction is a somewhat involved procedure, but is fully
analogous to the (3 + 1)-dimensional case [100,101]. Suppressing the details, the coordinate
conditions
γ = 1
and
Π = 0
(21)
can be consistently chosen, and subsequently, the action integral reduces to [99]
IR =

where, writing △Ψ ≡Ψ′′,

which can be veriﬁed using a superpotential approach based on Noether’s theorem [102].
The auxiliary ﬁeld Ψ is determined by solving [99,103,104]
