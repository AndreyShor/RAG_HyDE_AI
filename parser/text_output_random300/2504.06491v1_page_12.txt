FIG. 7.
Steps to process inelastic neutron scattering for analysis. (a) Raw scattering data at ℏω=[0.3, 0.5] meV from sample
at T=1.7 K with incident neutron energy Ei=3.32 meV. Parasitic arc-like chiral features stemming from elastic line Bragg
peak bleed into the inelastic data are highlighted at the intersection of the light-pink curves overlayed on the data. Details on
this elastic bleed effect and its tracking are included in the Supplemental Information. (b) Data after subtraction of He and
CYTOP backgrounds with an empirically-determined shielding factor. (c) Removal of temperature-independent background
using process of Equation 3. (d) Data after D6 symmetrization, yielding sets on which analyses are performed.
FIG. 8.
Scattering contours at various scattering energies for samples at T=1.7 K and T=40 K. All plots are on the same
scale using the same color maps as those in Figures 1-3.
