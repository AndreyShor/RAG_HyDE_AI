Another interesting aspect of the supercritical |q| > qc case is that H < 2m is possible—
the total energy can be less than the rest energy of the particles! For H < 2m, only J 2 < 0
is possible and the shaded region in Figure 12 is absent. Consequently, only unbounded
motion is possible; some trajectories in phase space for this case are shown in Figure 14. All
types of unbounded motions An and Bn are realized. Note that all trajectories curve more
toward the r axis (due to the additional effect of gravitational attraction) relative to that
of ﬂat space electrodynamics. They are also shifted in the positive p direction due to the
p-dependence of the gravitational potential.
In 1 + 1 ﬂat-space electrodynamics, the total energy of the system is restricted to
H ≥2m for attractive charges, but no such restriction on H exists for repulsive charges. We
see that, in a general relativistic theory, the same situation prevails.
The time-reversed trajectories corresponding to these cases can all be obtained by
setting ϵ = −1, and trajectories in the r < 0 region are obtained from those in r > 0 by
reversing the signs of both r and p.

5.4.3. Charged Particle Motion with Λe ̸= 0
This is the most general case for two-body motion in the electrovacuum. The dy-
namics is governed by a combination of gravitational attraction, electromagnetic attrac-
tion/repulsion, and the cosmological constant. The signs of γm and κ2

The possible range of motions is now rich and complicated [105], and a set of sample
trajectories is presented in Figure 15. One of the noteworthy special cases occurs particular
range of negative Λe and small mass (or large H/m0), where the trajectories have a double-
peaked structure. This is shown in the top panel of Figure 15 and is particularly noticeable
for Λe/(κm0)2 = −0.5, shown as the solid curve. The particles begin at r = 0 with equal
and opposite initial momenta, reach a maximum separation, and then reverse direction due
to the combined attractive electromagentic and graviational forces. But they soon reverse
direction again, moving apart until reaching a second maximum after which they return
to the starting point. For small values of |q|, the double peak structure is present, but for
sufﬁciently large |q|, it disappears.
