FIG. 1. Interactions between magnetic atoms. (a) Sketch of the DDI between two magnetic atoms polarized by B. The
interaction is long-range and anisotropic (red and blue halos). It is attractive (red) when the atoms are head to tail (lower right
panel) and repulsive (blue) when they are side by side (lower left panel). (b) Left: Sketch of the contact interaction and its
tunable strength. Right: Feshbach spectrum measured via atom loss spectroscopy on thermal samples of 164Dy atoms in the
apparatus of Ref. [18] for B varying from 0 to 4G, together with the expected variation of as. At each resonance as diverges.
The background scattering length is set to 85.5 a0, see e.g. [5].
term in addition to Vdd. In the ultracold dilute regime,
this term is well captured by a contact pseudopotential
Vc(r) = gsδ(r),
(2)
where the coupling constant gs = 4πℏ2as/m is set by the
s-wave scattering length as [2]. In contrast to Vdd, Vc is
isotropic and short-range. The total pseudopotential is
given by Vint(r) = Vdd(r) + Vc(r) with as including the
dipolar s-wave contribution [3, 19–21]. The ratio ϵdd =
add/as characterizes the contact-DDI competition.
Interestingly, as can be widely tuned experimentally
by altering the magnitude of B and exploiting Fesh-
bach resonances [1, 2]. Magnetic lanthanide atoms ex-
hibit remarkably dense Feshbach spectra with multiple
resonances addressable with an offset field of just a few
Gauss, see Fig. 1(b) [5, 22–24]. This enables the use of
easy-to-generate weak magnetic fields, which in turn pro-
vides remarkable tunability with both as and the dipole
orientation being readily adjusted through several pairs
of small coils controlling B [5].

BASIC MANY-BODY ASPECTS OF
DIPOLAR QUANTUM BOSE GASES
A.
Mean-field description of dipolar gases
At ultralow temperatures, due to statistical effects,
bosons form a macroscopic wavefunction extending over
the whole system - a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) [2].
Deep in this quantum degenerate regime, weakly inter-
acting Bose gases can be described by a classical com-
plex field, ψ(r). It embodies the macroscopic wavefunc-
tion but neglects its fluctuations, and interactions are
accounted for only at the mean-field (MF) level. Within
this framework, ψ(r) satisfies the Gross-Pitaevskii equa-
tion (GPE), which for dipolar gases writes
iℏ∂ψ
∂t =
−ℏ2∆

Here n(r) = |ψ(r)|2 is the spatial density, ψ(r) is normal-
ized to the total particle number N =
R
|ψ(r)|2d3r [2].
V (r) represents the trapping potential.
The last two
terms arise from the interaction potential Vint(r). The
first term is the local contact term, and the second term

is the non-local convolution of the DDI potential (1) with
the density [3]. The GPE describes the degenerate-gas
dynamics, by solving Eq. (3), as well as its ground state,
by replacing the left-hand side of (3), iℏ∂ψ
∂t , by µ0ψ,
where µ0 is the gas chemical potential.
B.
Mean-field dipolar effects — superfluid
excitation spectrum
The non-local and anisotropic nature of the DDI gives
rise to remarkable features in degenerate dipolar gases.
These features can be scrutinized by considering the in-
teraction potential in momentum space, ˜Vint(k). In par-
ticular, ˜Vint(k) provides insights into the elementary ex-
citation spectrum, which is key to understanding the gas’
dynamical and thermodynamic behaviors [1, 2].

Fully unconfined gases
For a fully unconfined gas, the elementary excita-
tions are waves of momentum k, i.e. wavelength 2π/|k|.
