ice, T42 resolution, 40 vertical levels) (Liu 2020), but with the RRTM radiative scheme (Mlawer
et al. 1997) (rather than SOCRATES). To validate this approach, we have verified that the total
radiative budget computed from the kernels approximately matches the simulated radiative budget
from the experiments (see Section 4.b).
3. Climate responses to superrotation
In this section, we describe the impact of the imposed torque on the atmospheric circulation
(Section 3a) and on climate, in particular surface temperature (Section 3b) and the distribution
of precipitation minus evaporation (Section 3c). The physical mechanisms associated with these
simulated changes will be discussed in more detail in Sections 4, 5 and 6.
a. Atmospheric circulation
We first consider the response of the time-averaged atmospheric circulation to the imposed
upper-tropospheric torque. Figure 1 shows the zonally-averaged zonal wind and the meridional
mass streamfunction for both the control run (𝐹0 = 0 m.s−1.day−1, panel a) and the run with the
largest prescribed torque (𝐹0 = 4 m.s−1.day−1, panel b).
