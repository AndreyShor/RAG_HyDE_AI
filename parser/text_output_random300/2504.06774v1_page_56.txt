Vectorization is another core technique implemented in deep learning to enhance com-
putational efficiency. Instead of processing each data point individually, vectorization
uses matrix operations to handle multiple training examples simultaneously, reducing
computations between layers [47]. By representing inputs, weights, and activations as
matrices, forward and backward propagation can be executed more efficiently, reducing
the computational overhead for large data sets.
