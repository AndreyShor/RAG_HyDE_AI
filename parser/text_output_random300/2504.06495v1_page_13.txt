a connection between branch counts and squared norms, we propose modifying the law of
motion by introducing small-signal truncation — a mechanism that eliminates components
of the state vector ψ(τ) once their amplitude falls below a certain threshold. While this
truncation may seem artiﬁcial, it could emerge naturally if quantum mechanics approximates
an underlying discrete theory.
Consider an analogy with numerical simulation: A quantum simulation on a digital com-
puter must approximate the continuous complex amplitudes of the Schr¨odinger equation
using ﬁnite-precision arithmetic, causing numbers below machine precision to vanish. Sim-
ilarly, if the fundamental state and dynamics of reality are discrete — resembling a vast
cellular automaton — then the Schr¨odinger equation would be an emergent approximation,
and some form of small-signal truncation could naturally arise from the system’s discrete
nature.
This analogy is not meant to imply that the universe is a simulation. Rather, it illus-
trates how any discrete theory underlying quantum mechanics would likely impose limits on
amplitude precision, which could naturally give rise to small-signal truncation.
To model small-signal truncation in this paper, we introduce a thresholding mechanism:
when the amplitude of a state component ψb(τ) drops below a ﬁxed threshold, it is removed
from the total state vector of the multiverse. This truncation occurs continuously over time,
while the system otherwise evolves according to the Schr¨odinger equation and undergoes
natural branching due to decoherence. In the next section, we formalize this idea within a
basic branching model and explore its implications.

Basic branching model with truncation
In this section, we present a stylized model that demonstrates how quantum dynamics with
small-signal truncation leads to the emergence of the Born rule. The model is deliberately
simpliﬁed: it assumes that K-way branching occurs at ﬁxed time intervals with constant
branching ratios, and truncation is based on a threshold of the squared amplitude, with the
time dependence of the threshold given exogenously (i.e. determined outside of our current
