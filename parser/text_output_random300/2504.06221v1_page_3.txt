FIG. 2. Interactions and dispersion relation of a dipolar gas (a,b): for a 3D unconfined gas, (c-f): in an infinite
pancake trap with dipoles (c,d) along, (e,f) transverse to the excitation direction. The geometries are illustrated as insets of
(b,d,f). The energies are rescaled by ℏω⊥= h × 150 Hz and the momenta by
√
2/ℓ⊥. The parameters are chosen so that
gsn = 35ℏω⊥and matching 164Dy values, namely as = 130.8a0, m = 164 atomic mass units, n3D = 9.8 × 1020m−3. The
pancake transverse confinement frequency is set to ω⊥. We use a quasi-2D approximation with the gas transverse distribution
set to the harmonic oscillator ground state, n2D =
√
2πn3Dℓ⊥, and neglect magnetostriction, which quantitatively modifies
˜Vdd(k) and ϵ(k). Qualitative behaviors are illustrated. (a,c,e): Characteristic energies: contact interaction energy gsn (solid
black), DDI energy ˜Vdd(k)n for ϵdd = 1 (blue), kinetic energy ℏ2k2/2m (red). (b,d,f): Dispersion relation (5) for ϵdd = 0.5
(dark blue), ϵdd = 1 (light blue), ϵdd = 1.25 (green), ϵdd = 1.31 (yellow) together with the non-dipolar case ϵdd = 0 (black
dashed-dotted) and the non-interacting one gs = gdd = 0 (gray dashed-dotted). The higher ϵdd values are shown only in (f)
and unstable elsewhere. (a,b) show two excitation directions: θk = 0 (dashed lines) and θk = π/2 (solid lines). In (d), the
antiroton behavior expected beyond the longitudinal approximation is sketched (dotted blue line, inspired from Ref. [25]).
Within Bogoliubov theory – applicable to weakly inter-
acting gases – the energies ϵ(k) of these excitations as-
sume the form:
ϵ(k) =
s
ℏ2k2

ℏ2k2
2m + 2 ˜Vint(k)n

with n the ground-state density– here assumed to be uni-
form [2–5].
For a contact-interacting gas [Vint(r) = Vc(r)], the
momentum-space interaction potential is given by the
Fourier transform of Eq. (2), ˜Vint(k) = gs, and is constant
across all momenta, see Fig. 2(a). For such a potential,
Eq. (5) evolves from a linear phononic dispersion at small
k, ϵ(k) = ℏck with c =
p
gsn/m the speed of sound, to a
quadratic free-quasi-particle dispersion ϵ(k) ∼ℏ2k2/2m
at large k, see Fig. 2(b) [2].
For a uniform and unconfined three-dimensional (3D)
dipolar gas, the momentum-space DDI is also simply
given by the Fourier transform of Eq. (1),
˜Vdd(k) = gdd

3 cos(θk)2 −1

,
(6)
where θk is the angle between k and the dipole axis [3,
5].
The full momentum-dependent interaction is then
˜Vint(k) = gs + ˜Vdd(k).
Remarkably, ˜Vint(k) does not depend on the magni-
tude of k but only on its orientation, see Fig. 2(a). Thus,
the DDI does not introduce new types of elementary
excitations here.
Instead, it induces anisotropic fea-
tures in the excitation spectrum and speeds of sound,
see Fig. 2(b).
Specifically, the modes along the dipole
direction (θk = 0) harden (increased ϵ(k) and c), while
transversely (θk = π/2) they soften (reduced ϵ(k) and c).
This additionally shifts the threshold scattering length a∗
at which phonons become unstable (i.e., where the speed
of sound vanishes), from a∗= 0 in the purely contact-
interacting case to a∗= add (i.e. ϵdd = 1), see Fig. 2(b)
and Eq. (6) at θk = π/2 [3, 4].
