Basic and recurrent notation
Numbers. We write N = {1, 2, . . .} and N0 = {0, 1, 2, . . .}. We let R+ = (0, ∞) and R+
0 =
[0, ∞). Without specific mention, the logarithm will be taken with respect to the natural base e.
For a ∈R, we use ⌊a⌋to represent the largest integer not greater than a. Given n ∈N, we write
[n] = {1, . . . , n} and [n]0 = {0, 1, . . . , n}.
Subsets of Euclidean space. We consider the space Rd where d ≥1 is a fixed dimension. We
let (e1, . . . , ed) be the orthonormal basis of Rd. For x ∈Rd, we write x = (x1, . . . , xd) for its
coordinates. For r ∈R and x ∈Rd, we write B(x, r) for the ball centred at x and with radius r.
Furthermore, we write
Br(x)
def= B(x, er) ,
(3.1)
and we simply write Br for Br(0). For every Lebesgue measurable set D ⊆Rd, we denote its
Lebesgue measure by |D|.
Functions and measure spaces. We write C(Rd) (resp. Cc(Rd), Cb(Rd)) for the space of continuous
(resp. continuous with compact support, continuous and bounded) functions from Rd to R. We write
C+
c (Rd) for the space of positive continuous functions from Rd to R with compact support. Given a
measure ν and a function f, we write ν(f) to denote the integral of f against ν.
Maxima and related sets. For a subset D ⊆Rd, a function f : D →R, and λ > 0 we let
MD(f)
def= sup
x∈D
f(x) ,
Dλ
D(f)
def= {x ∈D : f(x) ≥MD(f) −λ} .
(3.2)
For D = Rd, we simply write M(f) and Dλ(f). Additionally, if D = [0, R]d for some R ≥0, then
we write MR(f) (resp. Dλ
R(f)) in place of M[0,R]d(f) (resp. Dλ
[0,R]d(f)). Furthermore, when it will
be convenient to do so, we will use the following shorthands,
Mx,r(f) = MBr(x)(f) ,
Dλ
x,r(f) = Dλ
Br(x)(f) ,
(3.3)
and also, for r2 > r1, we set
Mx,r2,r1(f) = MBr2(x)\Br1(x)(f) ,
Dλ
x,r2,r1(f) = Dλ
Br2(x)\Br1(x)(f) .

Topological preliminaries
In this subsection, we collect some results on the convergence of random measures and introduce
the concept of stable convergence, which plays an important role in our main result regarding the
convergence of supercritical GMC measures.
Laplace functionals. It is well known that if η is a random point measure on Rd, then its law is
uniquely characterised by its Laplace functional on the set C+
c (Rd):
C+
c (Rd) ∋φ 7→E[exp(−η(φ))] .
We also recall that, if ην is a Poisson point measure with intensity measure ν, then
E exp[(−ην(φ))] = exp

Remark 3.1. For γ >
√
2d and a Radon measure ν on Rd, let Pγ[ν] be the integrated atomic random
measure with parameter γ and spatial intensity ν as specified in Defnition 1.5. Then, in this case, for
every φ ∈C+
c (Rd), it holds that
E[exp(−Pγ[ν](φ))] = exp
