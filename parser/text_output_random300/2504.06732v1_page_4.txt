FIG. 2.
Examples of the three categories of false PMMs.
(a)-(c): Energy spectrum in the minimal chain. All examples
have a highly localized near-zero-energy state at ∆Z/∆= 0.8
that satisfies the TR condition of Eq. (8). The background
color indicates the topological invariant in the infinite chain:
a yellow (red) background indicates that the infinite chain
is trivial (topological).
All three PMMs at ∆Z/∆= 0.8
lie in the trivial regime, thus these are false PMMs.
(d)-
(f): Energy spectrum in a long uniform chain (N = 100)
with the same parameters as in panels (a)-(b), respectively.
The false PMMs in panels (d) and (e) are associated with
a fourfold degenerate ZEC, the false PMM in panel (f) is
not. The false PMMs in panels (d) and (f) [panel (e)] are
at smaller [larger] Zeeman energies than what is required for
the long chain to enter the topological phase.
(g)-(i): En-
ergy spectrum in the same long uniform chain as for (d)-(f),
but now without any superconductivity. The ZEC that were
present in panels (d) and (e) are still present in panels (g)
and (h), even without superconductivity. The parameters are
(rounded to three significant digits) as follows. (a), (d), (g):
t/∆= 1.02, ΦSOI/π = 0.452, µN/∆= 0.624, µS/∆= −5.06.
(b), (e), (h): t/∆= 1.49, ΦSOI/π = 0.425, µN/∆= 1.21,
µS/∆= 6.35. (c), (f), (i): t/∆= 0.637, ΦSOI/∆= 0.0706,
µN/∆= 0.891, µS/∆= 0.706. All three false PMMs have
|∆E| < 10−8, Eex > 0.05, |∆QL| = |∆QR| < 10−7, and
1 −ML = 1 −MR < 0.11.
chain limit is not necessarily at the Zeeman energy, where
the PMM is found in the short chain. Finally, we note
that the transition to the TP also results in a closing of
the gap in the bulk spectrum, and this can (occasionally)
cause an ambiguity when the transition and a potential
ZEC are close in Zeeman energy.
A.
False PMMs in two-site chains
We first consider the minimal chain with N = 2 (three
dots in total). Since U = 0, as above, the Hamiltonian
from Eq. (1) can be written in the BdG form, giving
HBdG.
To find PMMs, we first search for zero-energy
solutions of the minimal chain, thus setting det(HBdG) =
0, which implies
0=(µ2
N,a−∆2
Z)[2t4−4t2µN,aµS,a+(µ2
S,a+∆2)(µ2
N,a−∆2
Z)]
+ 2t4[µ2
N,a −∆2
Z cos (2ΦSOI)].
(9)
If Eq. (9) is approximately fulfilled, then the minimal
chain hosts a state that is (almost) at zero-energy and so
could be an (imperfect) PMM. In particular, we can solve
Eq. (9) for µS,a. To get a real solution, i.e., µS,a ∈R, the
following condition must be fulfilled
4t4∆2
Z cos2(ΦSOI) ≥∆2(∆2
Z −µ2
N,a)2.
(10)
In particular, the left-hand side of Eq. (10) vanishes as
ΦSOI →π
2 and so, for given t, ΦSOI, ∆Z, and ∆we must
have µN,a ≈∆Z (where we choose µN,a, ∆Z > 0). We
note that in this limit, µS,a diverges, such that Eq. (9)
is satisfied. Of course, for other values of ΦSOI, Eq. (9)
can still be solved. However, the solution is then more
involved.
Although
Eq.
(9)
governs
whether
there
is
a
(near-)zero-energy state, it is important to note that
these states are not necessarily (imperfect) PMMs since
we do not yet know much about their localization. In par-
ticular, to determine if these states are imperfect PMMs,
we also require a constraint on the wave function.
In
general this is a complicated task that cannot be eas-
ily achieved analytically. However, it was pointed out in
Ref. 73 that a zero-energy state localized on the first site
of a double QD system without superconductivity can be
associated with false PMMs. Since this state is mainly
localized on the first QD, introducing superconductivity
on the second QD has only little impact on the state.
Furthermore, adding more QDs to the right-hand side of
the system has only a small effect on a zero-energy state
localized on the leftmost QD. The Hamiltonian of such a
double QD system is
H2QD =(d†

where σi (ηi) are the Pauli matrices acting in spin (posi-
tion) space and η0 is the unit matrix. We note that we do
not include a superconducting pairing since we are look-
ing for states localized on the first QD which, in our full
Hamiltonian, also does not have an SC pairing potential.
For this normal double QD system to host a zero-energy
state we require det(H2QD) = 0, which implies
0=det(H2QD)= (t2 −µN,aµS,a)2 −µ2

Solving, this gives µS,a =

µN,a±∆Z as a constraint.
To find analytically states that will become false
PMMs, we look for localized states that satisfy both
Eqs. (9) and (12) for µN,a and µS,a, with given t, ΦSOI,
∆Z, and ∆. We emphasize that there are solutions in
each quadrant of the µN versus µS parameter space, but
