(a) Bell fidelity of the non-local Bell pairs prior to and after
distillation on qubits (59,60,61,62,63,64). Simulations do not
fit the data well; one possibility is that the coherence varied
between the distillation run and when the coherence was
measured.

second set of data (see Fig. 10d) we see some strong im-
provement from distillation, but this does not persist well
to the highest fidelities and therefore limits us from dis-
tributing higher fidelity entanglement this way. In places
where we find improvement (say at e.g. 50µ s in Fig. 10b)
one can experience a loss of data, i.e, an acceptance prob-
ability below 50%.

CONCLUSIONS
We carried out both a numerical and experimental
analysis of some basic distillation protocols. The simplest
numerical analysis in Sec. II adds asymmetry among the
Bell pairs since the asymmetry can be inherent in the
way multiple Bell pairs are arranged prior to distillation.
That analysis points at regions in the noise parameter
space where entanglement distillations can provide im-
provements. A more involved analysis using device char-
acterization data, non-Pauli noise channels, and mod-
elling the echo sequence in our experiment allows us to
obtain reasonable agreement with the experimental data
obtained from entanglement distillation. The noise mod-
els indicate how practical difficulties in distillation come
from (1) a natural asymmetry among the Bell pairs be-
ing distilled; (2) understanding the noise which distilla-
tion must remove; (3) measurement noise; and (4) fix-
ing a metric of success for distillation. When the metric
