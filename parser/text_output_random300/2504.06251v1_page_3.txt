of electronic structures between aligned and non-aligned samples reveals that the moirÂ´e po-
tential plays a pivotal role in enhancing the topological flat band in the aligned sample. Our
study provides experimental guiding lines to narrow down the phase space of rhombohedral
graphene, laying an important foundation for understanding exotic quantum phenomena in
this emerging platform.
