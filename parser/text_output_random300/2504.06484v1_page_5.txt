In each panel, we display both cases with
squeezing effect in the weak-coupling approximation (black
solid line) and exact form (red dashed line) by exploiting
self-Kerr nonlinearity, in addition to the exact result with-
out squeezing effect (blue dotted line). Here the parameters
are ωb/2π = 30 GHz, ωc/2π = 50 kHz, κc = 10−9ωc, and
G(G) = ωc/5 for the case with (without) squeezing effect,
and the background temperature is T = 0.5 K.
sen around 0.1ωc to obtain better cooling for κb ≈2ωc,
its increase helps to the case for larger κb.
On the other hand, we show the cooling with the cou-
pling rate G with squeezing in comparison with the stan-
dard case. An appropriate coupling rate leads to opti-
mization of cooling, which shifts with the detuned fre-
quency ∆B. The trade-off with G in the first and third
terms in Eq. (23) can approximately interpret this op-
timization for G. It means that the cooling can not be
enhanced via keeping boosting the power for magnon-
mechanical coupling.
On the contrary, if the power is

the cooling can be improved instead. Besides, this figure
indicates that our approximate analysis fits the exact case
in weak-coupling regime where the optimal cooling can
be achieved.
Eventually, the phases θ and ϕ can be determined via
the relations (11) and (28). While the former should be
