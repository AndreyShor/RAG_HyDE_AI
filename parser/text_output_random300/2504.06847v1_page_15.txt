The medium-intensity band in the Raman spectrum of 2-AmpH2PO3 located at 2412 cm-1 
and the analogous strong band in the IR spectrum at 2408 cm-1 correspond to the characteristic 
P-H stretching vibration of hydrogen phosphite anion. The bands of POH vibrations 
(overlapping with cation modes) were recorded at 1228 cm-1 in both spectra. The manifestations 
of asPO2 modes, which overlap with CH and rg vibrations, were located at 1131 cm-1 and 
1124 cm-1 in the Raman and IR spectra, respectively. The bands of symmetric sPO2 vibrations 
were recorded at 1039 cm-1 (Raman) and 1043 cm-1, with the shoulder at 1054 cm-1 (IR). The 
manifestations of PH and PH modes were observed in both spectra at ~1025 cm-1 and ~1015 
cm-1, respectively. The medium-intensity Raman band at 926 cm-1 and strong IR band at 927 
cm-1 correspond to stretching PO(H) vibrations. The bands recorded in both spectra at ~550 
cm-1 and ~520 cm-1 represent the manifestations of PO2 and PO2 (overlapping with cation 
vibrations) modes, respectively. The medium-intensity bands at 433 cm-1 (Raman) and 426 cm-
1 (IR) were assigned to PO(H) vibrations overlapping with CNC modes. 
As expected, the nature of the vibrational manifestations of HSO4- anions in both 
polymorphs of 2-AmpHSO4 is quite similar. However, there are significant differences in the 
spectra regarding band intensities and shapes (see Fig. 10), which are also affected by the 
somewhat different overlap with the cation modes. Medium-intensity bands of SOH vibrations 
(in the case of phase I overlapping with cation CH, rg, NH modes) were recorded in the 
1350-1330 cm-1 region in the IR spectra. The characteristic intense bands of asSO3 vibrations 
are present in the IR spectra as asymmetric slightly split (due to overlap with cation modes) 
doublets located in the 1260-1130 cm-1 region. The corresponding Raman bands exhibit much 
lower intensities, with some exception for the medium-intensity band recorded at 1234 cm-1 in 
the spectrum of phase I. The manifestations of the sSO3 vibrations, which overlap with mixed 
rg, rg, NH and CH, rg modes of cation, were localized in the 1035-990 cm-1 region as 
strong bands in both spectra of both polymorphs. A pair of strong bands in the 860-800 cm-1 
region in the IR spectra (weak bands in the Raman spectra) represent manifestations of SO(H) 
stretching vibrations. The bands recorded in all available spectra in the 610-570 cm-1 region 
were assigned to anion bending modes SO3 overlapping with cation rg vibrations. The 
manifestations of ()OSO3 bending vibrations (overlapping with CNC cation modes) are 
represented by the bands present in the 440-415 cm-1 region of both polymorphs. 
Two strong bands recorded in the IR spectrum of (2-Amp)2SO4H2O at 1132 and 1109 cm-1 
represent originally triply degenerate 3SO4 vibrations. The corresponding weak Raman band
