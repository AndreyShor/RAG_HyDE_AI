emission lines. We initially performed the disentangling on pho-
tospheric helium absorption lines between 4000 Å and 4500 Å
and the Balmer lines Hγ and Hδ to derive suitable values for KB
and KBe. Subsequently, we disentangled the entire spectrum us-
ing these fixed RV semi-amplitudes. By focussing on the blue
part of the spectrum, we emphasised the region where the pre-
sumably hotter Be star companion’s contribution is larger and
avoided the Hα and Hβ Balmer lines, which show the strongest
emission and variability.
For the RV semi-amplitude of the narrow-lined star, there is
a minimum in the χ2 distribution for KB = 76.0 ± 0.9 km s−1,
consistent with the results from orbital analysis. For the broad-
lined companion star, the χ2 distribution is minimised for KBe =
5 ± 4 km s−1, corresponding to a dynamic mass ratio of qdyn =
KBe
KB = 0.066 ± 0.053. However, as a consequence of the broad
and flat spectral lines of the Be star, the disentangled spectra are
nearly identical for values KBe ≲20 km s−1, as illustrated in
Appendix B.
The component spectra obtained with the shift-and-add dis-
entangling are shown in Fig. 4. The spectra have been rescaled,
that is, divided by their estimated continuum flux contributions
(0.6 and 0.4 for the narrow-lined and broad-lined stars, respec-
tively; see Sect. 6.1.2), to restore the equivalent widths to the
values they would have if the stars were observed individually.
The spectra are set to a continuum flux of one. Although the flux
ratio affects the overall scaling of the spectral line depths, it can-
not be directly derived from the disentangling method without
additional assumptions. Instead, we estimate the light ratio as
part of the spectral analysis and refine the estimate with a fit of
the spectral energy distribution (SED, see Sect. 7), taking into
account the wavelength dependence of the flux contributions.
The secondary spectrum reveals the presence of a luminous
companion star with shallow H and He absorption lines and
emission features in the Balmer line cores. This indicates that
the companion of the narrow-lined star is indeed a luminous star
and not a dark remnant like the previously hypothesised BH. The
sum of the individual disentangled spectra superimposed on the
observed composite spectra at quadrature is shown in Fig. 5, for
a region around the Hδ line. A plot showing the full wavelength
range of the observed, disentangled and modelled spectra is pro-
vided in Fig. B.3 in the Appendix.
The second disentangling method is described in detail in
Seeburger et al. (2024). This approach combines a linear alge-
bra solver step to compute the component spectra from the input
data (epoch spectra and initial RV guesses) with a nonlinear op-
timisation step to determine the best-fit input parameters. The
method yields both the disentangled component spectra and RV
estimates for each component. We find that the Seeburger et al.
(2024) method yields comparable results, both for the inferred
mass ratio (≈0.061) and the two component spectra (see Fig. B.2
and Appendix B for details). Slight differences are seen in some
of the spectral lines, but the differences do not affect our analysis
results or main conclusions.
Both techniques assume that the spectral components re-
main time-invariant, except for Doppler shifts in wavelength. Al-
though we avoided the Hα and Hβ lines during the disentangling
process, it is important to note that even the lesser variability
in the Hγ and Hδ lines can impact the results (as was the case
for VFTS 291, for example, see Villaseñor et al. 2023). Conse-
quently, the exact profiles of the Balmer lines in the component
spectra may be influenced by emission and should be interpreted
with caution, in particular for the broad-lined companion.
6. Spectral analysis
Through spectral disentangling of the high-resolution, multi-
epoch spectra, we have revealed the presence of a second lumi-
nous component in the system. Given the lower light contribu-
tion of the companion and the broad spectral lines, the combined
spectra are dominated by the narrow-lined star, resembling the
composite spectra of recently discovered bloated stripped stars
with Be companions.
We aim to determine stellar parameters for both stars. To
this end, the disentangled spectra were compared with synthetic
spectra from model atmospheres. For the broad-lined Be star,
