how close the tip is to the sample surface. This one is computed based on the absolute height of 
the probe and usually favors small setpoins. c, reward of phase is defined to reflect how well the 
scanning is kept in the attractive mode. It’s computed by counting how many phase pixels are in 
the attractive mode with values above the free-air phase and usually favors small drive amplitudes 
and large setpoints. Here the expected distribution of rewards is only shown in the drive amplitude 
vs. setpoint space for easier visualization. d, phase as a function of tip-sample distance in theory. 
When the tip is very far from the sample surface, the phase stays close to the free-air phase 
(indicated by the red horizontal dashed line). When the probe gets closer and interacts with sample 
surface in the attractive mode, the phase remains above the free-air phase. When the probe is so 
close to the sample surface that it’s working in repulsive mode, the phase will be below the free-
air phase. e, expected Pareto scatter plot for reward of trace and reward of distance. The control 
parameters that give good alignment of trace and retrace are expected to give small tip-sample 
distance. Therefore, the expected Pareto front collapses into a trivial Pareto point. f-g, the reward 
of phase is competing with the reward of trace and reward of distance in the parameter space. Thus, 
there are expected trade-offs between them. The cartoons on the axes of e-g show the physical 
meaning of the extremes of each reward.

Define multiple objectives/rewards for the tapping mode SPM 
To define reward functions suitable for optimizing tapping mode across a diverse range of 
materials, environments, and scales, we focus on identifying common features of high-quality TM 
scans. First, the trace and retrace of the height channel should be in close agreement and ideally 
follow the sample's true height profile. However, since the ground-truth sample height profile is 
generally inaccessible, we define a second key characteristic: the probe should be positioned as 
close to the sample as possible to minimize the tip-sample distance. Finally, the phase values 
should consistently remain above the free-air phase (Figure 1d) to ensure scanning occurs in the 
attractive regime [47-49]. Operating in this regime reduces tip-sample interactions, thereby 
lowering the risk of tip and sample damage.
