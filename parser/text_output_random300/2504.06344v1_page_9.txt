to a non-constant-F solution. Thus, the constant-F self-dual fractional instanton is a
measure zero set in the moduli space of charge r/N self-dual multi-fractional instantons
on T4 with ∆(r, k, ℓ) = 0 and gcd(k, r) ̸= r.
In conclusion, we take the analysis here to suggest that the reason behind the failure
of the ∆-expansion for gcd(k, r) ̸= r observed in [1] is that the ∆= 0 background one
expands around is generically not known. Except for a measure zero set on the moduli
space, it is not a constant-F one. However, as we discuss further below, it is desirable
to better understand the relation between the ∆- and λ-expansions.
3. SU(2) with Q = r/2, r > 1: Finally, in section 4.4, we point out that a similar issue (to
the one described above for gcd(k, r) ̸= r) exists for all SU(2) instantons of charge Q =
r/2, for any integer r > 1, thus including also all integer-charged self-dual instantons10
on the twisted T4.
While a constant-F solution exists for ∆(r, 1, 1) = 0 or rL3L4 = L1L2, it only allows
for 4 constant holonomies, or translational moduli. The other moduli correspond to
deformations that produce non-constant field strength. We show this by considering
general fluctuations around the constant-F solution and studying the nonlinear self-
duality equation on the tuned T4.
Via an analytic argument that goes beyond the
λ-expansion of section 4.1, we argue in section 4.4 that additional 4r −4 moduli appear
and that their turning on makes the solution non-constant. We are, however, unable
to show that the moduli space becomes compact (this is expected on T4, see also the
remarks of [55] on the r = 2 solution) leaving this as an interesting area of future study.
The second focus of this paper is our use of the SU(3) numerical simulations to provide a
comparison of the “exact” solution for the 2-lump multi-fractional instanton of charge Q = 2/3
with the analytic solution obtained via the ∆-expansion on a detuned T4. This is presented
in section 5. We show, for two values of ∆< 1, ∆= 0.236 on Figure 11, and ∆= 0.129
on Figure 12, that the comparison, obtained by a fit of the moduli of the analytical solution
(found using the ∆-expansion) to the numerical self-dual configurations is rather impressive.

Outlook
The moduli space of fractional instantons on T4 is a subject of mathematical interest, which
also has significant implications for understanding the semiclassical expansion in field theory.
While this paper marks a step toward understanding its structure, many directions remain
open for better comprehension.
1. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of the case
gcd(k, r) = r, on the tuned-T4 with ∆(r, k, ℓ) = 0 (rℓL3L4 = kL1L2), demonstrating
that an abelian constant-F solution remains unchanged under self-duality-preserving
10It is well known that without any twists, there is no Q = 1 self-dual instanton on the T4, as follows from
the Nahm transform [53, 54].
