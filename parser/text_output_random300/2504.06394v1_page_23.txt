Here, we have used the fact that
∫𝑎
−𝑎𝑤0𝑤1d𝑟= 0, which is trivial since 𝑤0𝑤1 is an odd
function of𝑟. The correlation 𝑅(𝑤, 𝑤0) will be close to 1 when the flow islargely symmetrical,
and closer to zero when the flow is noticeably asymmetrical. The opposite is true of the
correlation 𝑅(𝑤, 𝑤1). In the the right panel of fig. 11 we plot the symmetrical correlation
𝑅(𝑤, 𝑤0) (solid line) and the asymmetrical correlation 𝑅(𝑤, 𝑤1) (dashed line) as predicted
from our analytical model.
Based on the definition of 𝜉we expect a transition when 𝜉∼1. Fig. 11 confirms this
expectation, showing that a transition indeed occurs at this point when the geometry 𝑎(𝑠)
satisfies (6.1). We note that for times when 𝑓(𝑡) = 0, our analysis does not apply, and the
flow remains symmetric, even for large utricles. This follows from (6.4), as it is clear that
𝑤1 = 0 when 𝑓(𝑡) = 0.
Our analysis of the onset of vortical flow is further supported by numerical simulations,
represented by triangles and stars in the righthand panel of fig. 11. These simulations
were conducted using COMSOL, modelling the utricle as an ellipsoidal expansion of the
toroidal geometry. We find good agreement between the analytical predictions and COMSOL
simulations regarding the emergence of vortical flow. (We attribute the small discrepancy
between the COMSOL and analytical model to the fact that the geometry is not identical in
both cases.) Furthermore, the consistency between the numerical simulations and analytical
solutions suggests that, although the first-order correction may be larger than the leading-order
term, the subsequent terms in the series remain well behaved, ensuring that the asymptotic
ordering is preserved.
7. Discussion and conclusion
In this study, we developed a mathematical framework to model fluid flow in the semicircular
canals of the vestibular system, focussing in particular on the interaction between the
fluid motion and cupular deformation. Through a systematic analytical and numerical
investigation, we identified distinct physical regimes and key mechanisms that govern
the fluid-structure response to an imposed rotation. Our results not only advance the
understanding of flow dynamics in these biologically relevant systems but also provide a
simple framework with the potential for analysing vestibular function and dysfunction in
response to head movements.
Our analytical approach consisted in solving the Navier-Stokes equations via an asymptotic
series in the small aspect ratio of the semicircular canals. Through asymptotic analysis, and
by connecting the fluid flow at the cupula to the cupular deformation, described via a plate
equation, we reduced the vestibular dynamics to an ODE system for the cupular deflection,
