FIG. 6. Elongation-induced segregation and ﬁltering. (A) Schematic of a textured channel featuring a narrow bottleneck
at the outlet. (B) Snapshots depicting the motion of a particle with κ = 0.9 (top row) and κ = 0.25 (bottom row). (C) Passing
success rate comparison for the particles in panel (B), evaluated over 64 diﬀerent initial entry conditions. (D) Illustration of a
ﬁltering device composed of multiple ﬁltering units, each equipped with an escape gap and a front nose designed for particle
trapping and storage. (E) Sequential snapshots demonstrating the successful exit of elongated particles while more rounded
particles become trapped and accumulate at the nose.
the ﬁltering units in trapping less elongated particles.
In summary, we have demonstrated that periodic tex-
turing of microﬂuidic channel boundaries can induce
alignment of elongated particles with the channel center-
line. This eﬀect strongly depends on particle elongation,
with more elongated particles aligning more eﬃciently
over shorter distances. The phenomenon persists across a
range of Reynolds numbers, extending beyond the Stokes
regime. These ﬁndings have signiﬁcant implications for
microﬂuidic applications, particularly in passive particle
sorting and ﬁltering technologies. Given advances in mi-
crofabrication, our approach is experimentally feasible,
as micron-scale textures can be routinely fabricated us-
ing, e.g., photolithography or soft lithography. Optimiz-
ing texture geometries, exploring ﬂuid inertia eﬀects at
higher Reynolds numbers (causing, e.g., inertial lateral
focusing [32]), and investigating the role of particle ge-
ometry, deformability and interactions could further en-
hance the applicability of this approach in biomedical
and industrial settings.
