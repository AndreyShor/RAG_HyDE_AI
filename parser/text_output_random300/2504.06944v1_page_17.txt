normal and shear forces directly, potentially leveraging 3-D LiDAR scans and prints. Additional 
studies should examine the effects of gas velocities and temperatures on the rate of viscous 
erosion from PSI events. Future studies should also consider the change in density as a function 
of depth, which likely affects cohesion, shear strength, and viscous erosion rate. Understanding 
the limitations in the equations for viscous erosion rate are important when establishing PSI 
computer codes, especially when modeling upcoming missions in the Artemis program. Failure 
to accurately predict the influences of geotechnical properties on viscous erosion rate from PSI 
events may result in significant damage to equipment, vehicles, or crew.
