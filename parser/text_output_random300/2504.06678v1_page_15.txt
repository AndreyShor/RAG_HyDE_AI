The boundary term leads to an anomalous conservation law when the path is non-closed:
∂µJµ = Fµν ˙λνδλµ
where Jµ = ⟨ψ|∂µψ⟩is the geometric flow.

Wess-Zumino-Witten Models Counteract Anomaly
Introduce the WZW term:
SWZ = k
4π
Z
S1×[0,1]
Tr(g−1dg)3,
g ∈SU(2)
here the boundary contribution is:
δSWZ = 2πkνqua
The choice k = 1 can make the anomaly match the quasi-topological number, ensuring the gauge invariance of the
path integral.

Equation of Motion for Parameters as Dynamic Fields
The parameter λ(t) is elevated to a kinetic variable and the action is modified to:
S =

The equation of motion is obtained by varying λ:

¨λµ = Fµν ˙λν + ∂µH
The parameter dynamics are driven by the Berry curvature and the gradient of the Hamiltonian together.

Its trace gives the geometric energy density:

4g (∂tλ)2
The tension tensor can guide the design of parameter control protocols to optimize energy dissipation.

Random Parameter Driving and Path Integration
Introduce random force ξ(t) to drive the parameter:
