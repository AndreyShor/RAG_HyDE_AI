Remark 3. It is interesting to comment the relations between a standard second order centered finite dif-
ference (FD) discretization of the Schrödinger operator and Theorem 3. Let us define a(x) := 2B
p
(1 −x)x
and c(x) := −Γ
2 (2x −1)2 −2B
p
(1 −x)x, i.e. we have set cos θ = 1 in the definition of the symbol. For
N ∈N+, consider the Schrödinger operator on L2(0, 1):
H(N)u(x) = −
1
(N + 1)2 a(x)u′′(x) + c(x)u(x)
with u(0) = u(1). If we discretize the domain in uniform steps of width h = 1/(N + 1), it follows that
the resulting FD discretization matrix is a GLT sequence with symbol a(x)(2 −2 cos θ) + c(x). The factor
1/N simultaneously plays the role of the discretization step-size as well as the semi-classical parameter. It
is clear that the ensuing GLT matrix-sequence is equivalent to the restricted Curie-Weiss model. Hence, the
restricted Curie-Weiss model defines a Schrödinger operator with potential c. In the parameter regime Γ = 1
and B = 1, c has the shape of a single well, cf. Section 5.1, whilst for the choices Γ = 1 and B ∈(0, 1),
c has the shape of a double wel, cf. Section 5.2. However, the fact that the parameter factor 1/N plays
simultaneously the role of the discretization step-size and of the semi-classical parameter is non-standard
from the numerical analysis viewpoint and the whole potential of a related theoretical study has still to be
explored further.

Numerical results
In the present section, we give various visualizations of the spectral features of the matrices ¯Hs
N, confirming
the derivations in Theorem 3. We fix the value of Γ and B and, for these fixed values, we consider the
matrix-size parameter N equal to 40, 80, 160, 320. We recall that Theorem 3 is an asymptotic one, as all
the GLT results, but the really impressive fact is that the spectrum of ¯Hs
N adheres to the spectral symbol
already for N = 40.
