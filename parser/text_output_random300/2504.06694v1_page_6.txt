COMPARISON OF FROBENIUS ALGEBRA STRUCTURES ON CALABI–YAU TORIC HYPERSURFACES

Deﬁnition 2.3. The primitive middle-dimensional cohomology of X = Xf(C) is deﬁned by
Hm−1
pr
(X) := coker

Hm−1(P, C)
i∗
−→Hm−1(X, C)

where i : X →P is the canonical embedding.
Note 2.4. The CY Frobenius structures on H0(PV(X)) ∼= Hn(X) in Deﬁnition 2.1 induces CY Frobenius
algebra structures on H0
pr(PV(X)) ∼= Hn
pr(X). Henceforth, the CY Frobenius structure refers to the
induced one on the primitive cohomology.
Recall that for a normal variety Y , the sheaf Ωk
Y of k-forms is not necessarily well-behaved. On
the other hand, the sheaf ˆΩk
Y := (Ωk
Y )∨∨is better behaved with which much of general theory is con-
cretely developed in a toric setting. We refer to [3, 6] for further discussion. We ﬁx a generator of
H0(PΣ, ˆΩm
PΣ(β)) where β is the anti-canonical class of PΣ:
Ω:=
X
|I|=m
det(ρI) bzIdzI
(2.3)
where for I = (i1, · · · , im) we write dzI = dzi1 ∧· · · ∧dzim, bzI = Q
i/∈I zi, and det(ρI) = det(ρi1| · · · |ρim)
with ρi primitive generators of the rays of Σ. Batyrev and Cox showed the following theorem.
Theorem 2.5 (Batyrev–Cox). [3, Theorem 10.13] Let X be a quasi-smooth ample Calabi–Yau hyper-
surface in an m-dimensional simplicial Gorenstein toric Fano variety P. Assume (1.2).6 Then there is a
canonical isomorphism of vector spaces
φΩ: R(f)aβ →Ha
pr(X, ˆΩm−1−a
X
)
for each 0 ≤a ≤m −1, deﬁned by
φΩ([F(z)]) = res

(−1)aa! FΩ
f a+1

∈Ha
pr(X, ˆΩm−1−a
X
)
for
F(z) ∈R(f)aβ.
Moreover, Hm−1
pr
(X, C) has a pure Hodge structure and hence there is a decomposition Hm−1
pr
(X, C) ∼=
Lm−1
a=0 Ha
pr(X, ˆΩm−1−a
X
). Therefore, there is a graded vector space isomorphism (depending on Ω)
φΩ:
m−1
M
a=0
R(f)aβ
∼
=
−→Hm−1
pr
(X, C).
Given that Hm−1
pr
(X, C) ∼= L∞
a=0 Ha
pr(X, ˆΩm−1−a
X
) holds for a degree reason, it is natural to ask
whether A(f) = L∞
a=0 R(f)aβ also coincides with Lm−1
a=0 R(f)aβ. It follows from proving the following
lemma.
Lemma 2.6. Let X be a quasi-smooth Calabi–Yau hypersurface in an m-dimensional simplicial Goren-
stein toric Fano variety P, deﬁned by f ∈S of degree deg f = β = −KP = P
ρ∈Σ(1) Dρ. Then we
have
R(f)pβ = 0
for
p ≥m.
Proof. By [3, Corollary 10.2], we have a C-vector space isomorphism
Hm(P \ X) ∼=
m
M
p=0
H0(P, ˆΩm
P((p + 1)X))
H0(P, ˆΩm
P(pX)) + dH0(P, ˆΩm−1
P
(pX))
.
(2.4)
By [3, Theorem 9.7], we have
H0(P, ˆΩm
P((p + 1)X)) =
 uΩ
f p+1 : u ∈Spβ

for any p ≥0, and the map
ψ : H0(P, ˆΩm
P ((p + 1)X))
∼
=
−→Spβ,
p ≥0
6If m is even, then, for a = m
2 , the map φΩ: R(f)aβ →Ha
pr(X, ˆΩm−1−a
X
) might not be an isomorphism without the
assumption (1.2).
