SO(1, 3), turns the above commutation relation to the following:
[Jij, Jkl] = i (ηikJjl + ηjlJik −ηjkJil −ηilJjk) ,
[Jij, Jk5] = i (ηikJj5 −ηjkJi5) ,
[Ji5, Jj5] = iJij,
[Jij, Jk4] = i (ηikJj4 −ηjkJi4) ,
[Ji4, Jj4] = iJij,
[Ji4, Jj5] = iηijJ45,
[Jij, J45] = 0,
[Ji4, J45] = −iJi5,
[Ji5, J45] = iJi4.
(101)
Next one may convert the generators to physical quantities by setting
Θij = ℏJij, and Xi = λJi5,
(102)
where λ is a natural unit of length, and furthermore identify the momenta as
Pi = ℏ
λJi4,
(103)
and set h = J45. Then given these identifications and the commutation relations above, one
obtains:
[Θij, Θkl] = iℏ(ηikΘjl + ηjlΘik −ηjkΘil −ηilΘjk) ,
[Θij, Xk] = iℏ(ηikXj −ηjkXi) ,
[Θij, Pk] = iℏ(ηikPj −ηjkPi) ,
[Xi, Xj] = iλ2
ℏΘij, [Xi, Pj] = iℏηijh, [Pi, Pj] = iℏ
λ2Θij,
[Xi, h] = iλ2
ℏPi, [Pi, h] = −iℏ
λ2Xi, [Θij, h] = 0.

From the above relations, it becomes clear that one is led to the following significant results.
First since the coordinates as well as the momenta are elements of this Lie algebra, they
exhibit a noncommutative behavior, implying that both the space-time and the momentum
space become quantized.
In addition it becomes evident that the commutation relation
between coordinates and momenta naturally yields a Heisenberg-type uncertainty relation.

Gauge Group and Representation
Starting with the formulation of a gauge theory for gravity in the space mentioned above, the
first step is to determine the group that shall be gauged. Naturally, the group we consider
is the one that describes the symmetries of the theory, in this case, the isometry group
of dS4, SO(1, 4). It is known though, that in the particular case of gauge theories built
on noncommutative spaces, on top of the commutators of the various fields, we also have
to properly treat their anticommutators.
Specifically, let us consider two elements of an
