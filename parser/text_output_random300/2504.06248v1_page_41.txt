only be a source (first condition of Thm. S5) to another vertex v that also receives from the source s. The vertex set
for the subgraph admitting the symmetry generator Sη is thus Wη = {v} ∪M. Using conditions 2,3,4 of Thm. S5,
Sη[zν] = (i P
j∈M νj(ωj −ω1)) zν, i.e., the monomial is an eigenfunction of the symmetry, Sη[zν] is functionally
dependent on zν and Sη[zν] is not a new constant of motion.

Basic examples for Theorem 3
The example that helped us obtain Thm. 3 through the singular vectors of the determining matrix is the following
one.

where A1 is any complex number, ω ∈R and we assume for now that ω1 ̸= ω + 2 Im(A1). The Koopman generator
of the dynamics is K = iω1z1∂1 + K2 + K3 + K4 + K5, where Kη = (iωzη + A1z1 −¯

η) ∂η for η ∈{2, 3, 4, 5}. Of
course, one can write the solution z1(t) = z1(0)eiω1t and then substitute it in the four independent equations for z2
to z5. From there, one can find the solution for z2(t) to z5(t) by quadrature. Yet, using the results of the paper leads
to conserved observables and we can avoid computing some or all quadratures. Indeed, Thm. S12 readily guarantees
that there is one conserved cross-ratio
C1(z) := c2345(z) = (z4 −z2)(z5 −z3)
(z4 −z3)(z5 −z2)
and four symmetries Sη = Kη −iω1zη∂η. Using the derivatives of cross-ratios computed in Eq. (S54), we thus find
the four constants of motion
C2(z) := S2[C1(z)] = [i(ω −ω1)z2 + A1z1 −¯

which can be verified analytically with K[Cη] = 0 or with symbolic calculations. Note also that C2 +C3 +C4 +C5 = 0,
meaning that there is at least one functional dependency. In fact, it is easily verified symbolically that the rank of
the Jacobian matrix of (C1, C2, ..., C5) is 3, so we have three functionally independent constants of motion. Note that
there is also one more. Indeed, since there is a source, we have a monomial eigenfunction z1 with eigenvalue iω1
and C0(t, z) = z1e−iω1t is a constant of motion. The dynamics can thus be reduced to two autonomous equations
and three constants of motion (e.g., C1, C2, C3) or one non-autonomous equation and four constants of motion (e.g.,
C0, C1, C2, C3).
If, moreover, ω1 = ω + 2 Im(A1), then the cross-ratio
C6(z) := c1234(z) = (z3 −z1)(z4 −z2)
(z3 −z2)(z4 −z1)
is also a constant of motion (c1345 and others are functionally dependent with c1234, c2345 as shown in subsection III C),
