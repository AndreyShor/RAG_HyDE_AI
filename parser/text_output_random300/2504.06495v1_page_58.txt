Proof of the conditional median results in Section 6
Proof of Equation (29).
We consider the continuous-time process in (18), assuming that
it has reached its steady state distribution in Theorem 4 by time τ = 0. It is well known (see,
e.g., Karlin and Taylor (1981), Chapter 15) that for this process, the survival probability up
to time τ for large τ is asymptotically proportional to the distance from the boundary, with
a coeﬃcient that depends on both σ and µ. Let fX(x) denote the stationary distribution of
the process, as established in Theorem 4:
fX(x) = 2µ

The survival probability from initial value x for large τ is:

as τ →∞.
Here, ∼means that the ratio of the left-hand side to the right-hand side converges to 1 as
τ →∞; that is, the expression gives the leading-order asymptotic behavior of the survival
probability for large τ. Using Bayes’ rule, the survival-conditioned density of X0 is:
fX0|Xτ̸=−∞(x) =
fX(x) · pτ(x)

This corresponds to a shifted Gamma distribution with shape parameter 2, rate parameter
2µ/σ2, and shift log(ǫ). Speciﬁcally, it is a Gamma(2, 2µ/σ2) distribution shifted by log(ǫ).
