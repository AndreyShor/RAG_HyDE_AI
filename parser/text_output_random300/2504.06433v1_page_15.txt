Deﬁnition 4.2 (Simpliﬁcation of states). Suppose we have an r-qubit register with qubits labeled
1, . . . , r, a set S ⊆[r], and an r-qubit state |ψ⟩.
a) Gate CSZ disappears on (or is turned oﬀby) |ψ⟩, if CSZ |ψ⟩= |ψ⟩.
b) Gate CSZ simpliﬁes to CT Z on |ψ⟩, if CSZ |ψ⟩= CT Z |ψ⟩̸= |ψ⟩, for some T ⊊S.
We say that CSZ simpliﬁes on |ψ⟩if either (a) or (b) hold.
Observe that the two cases (a) and (b) in Deﬁnition 4.2 above are mutually exclusive, given S
and |ψ⟩. Also observe that CSZ disappears on |ψ⟩if and only if ⟨x|ψ⟩= 0 for every computational
basis state |x⟩such that the string x has 1’s in all positions in S. CSZ simpliﬁes to CT Z on |ψ⟩if
and only if ⟨x|ψ⟩= 0 for every computational basis state |x⟩where x has a 0 in some position in
S −T; equivalently, |ψ⟩factors into a tensor product of a |1⟩state of each qubit in S −T, along
with some arbitrary state of the rest of the qubits.
We will use Lemmas 3.8, 3.7, and 3.6 to prove the next lemma, which is the main lemma of this
section.
Lemma 4.3 (Entanglement Lemma). Suppose we have an r-qubit register as in Deﬁnition 4.2,
and let S ⊆[r]. Let |ψ⟩be any state of the register, and let |ϕ⟩:= CSZ |ψ⟩. Then at least one of
the following must hold:
1. |ψ⟩is S-entangled,
2. |ϕ⟩is S-entangled,
3. CSZ simpliﬁes on |ψ⟩.
Proof. Let {A, B} and {C, D} be two partitions of [r] such that all four sets have nonempty inter-
section with S. Let |ψ⟩A and |ψ⟩B be arbitrary states of the qubits in A and B, respectively, and
let |ψ⟩:= |ψ⟩A ⊗|ψ⟩B. Deﬁne |ϕ⟩:= CSZ |ψ⟩. Suppose that CSZ does not simplify on |ψ⟩. We will
show that |ϕ⟩cannot be written as a tensor product of two states—one on the qubits in C and the
other on the qubits in D. As C and D were chosen arbitrarily, this shows that |ϕ⟩is S-entangled,
hence the lemma follows.
The two partitions {A, B} and {C, D} lead to a 4-partition of [r] into sets A∩C, A∩D, B ∩C,
and B ∩D, some of which may be empty. By rearranging qubits, we may assume WLOG that for
some k, ℓ, m ∈N we have
A ∩C = {1, . . . , k} ,
A ∩D = {k + 1, . . . , k + ℓ} ,
B ∩C = {k + ℓ+ 1, . . . , k + ℓ+ m} ,
B ∩D = {k + ℓ+ m + 1, . . . , r} .
Setting n := r −k −ℓ−m, we then have
|A ∩C| = k ,
|A ∩D| = ℓ,
|B ∩C| = m ,
|B ∩D| = n .
By rearranging the qubits within these four sets if necessary, we may also assume that their in-
tersections with S occur ﬁrst within each set. For example, A ∩C ∩S = {1, . . . , k1} for some
0 ≤k1 ≤k, and we set k2 := k −k1; similarly for the other three sets. The full layout is shown in
Figure 1.
