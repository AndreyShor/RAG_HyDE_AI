Considering that xUV ≫xeva, we have that

Now, for the modes that enter the horizon during PBH domination (y ≪1), and for a very
large xUV, the function Υ(xUV, y) asymptotes to
Υ(xUV ≫1, y ≪1) ≃Υ(∞, 0) = 2187

On the contrary, for the modes that are already inside the horizon during PBH domination
(y ≫1), and again for a very large UV cut-off, the function yΥ(xUV, y) asymptotes to the
value
yΥ(xUV ≫1, y ≫1) ≃yΥ(∞, ∞) = 6561π

for the modes that are already inside the horizon when the PBH starts dominating. This
last serves us as an estimation of the maximum amount of GWs produced. Eqns. (C.10)
and (C.11) are shown in Fig. 8 in dashed red and blue, respectively, and for a particular
choice of parameters, see the caption for details. We observe that both agree well with the
full numerical solution of (C.1), shown in continuous black line.
