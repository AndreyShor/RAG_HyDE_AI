where Γ is the relativistic adiabatic index. The func-
tions ν and λ depend on the radial coordinate r. The
perturbation of the pressure and the relative radial dis-
placement, ∆p and ξ, respectively, are assumed to have
a time dependence of eiωt, where the ω’s are the eigen-
frequencies corresponding to the normal modes of vi-
bration. Generally, in stable stellar configurations, this
frequency satisfies the condition ω > 0, and for a single-
phase stars the last stable configurations (where ω = 0)
corresponds to the point where ∂M
∂ρ changes the sign.
However, in stellar models featuring a first-order phase
transition with slow conversion at the interface, funda-
mental model can still have positive values beyond the
maximum mass point [67–69].
4.2 Mass-radius diagrams
Using the hybrid EoS obtained from the D3-D7/NL3*
model, the hydrostatic equilibrium equations (26)-(27)
were solved for a range of constituent quark mass from
m = 330 MeV to m = 390 MeV. The range of values
chosen for the constituent quark mass are around 345
MeV, which is the infrared mass function [70, 71] ob-
tained from lattice QCD calculations [72]. For a given
central pressure pc, the TOV equations were solved.
In Fig. 3, it is presented the MR diagram for each
constituent quark mass. All curves were computed un-
til the last stable star taking into account slow phase
transitions based on the positivity of the squared funda-
mental eigenvalue, ω2
0. Remarkably, for all six param-
eterization, the holographic model predicts stable HS
with mass higher than 2 solar masses, which is consis-
tent with the analysis of the pulsars PSR J1614-2230,
PSR J0348+0432 and PSR J0740+6620 [74–76]. Specif-
ically, for m = 390 MeV, the maximum HS mass reaches
2.7 M⊙. Additionally, the model is compatible with
recent NICER+XMM-Newton observational data [73].
Fig. 3 Mass-radius diagram for HS is presented using the D3-
D7/NL3* model. The solid red and dashed curves represent
the 95% confidence intervals for masses and radii of the pulsar
PSR J0740+6620 recently measured by NICER and XMM-
Newton collaboration [73]. The blue curves are related to the
95% confidence intervals for masses and radii measured by
NICER, with the dashed and solid lines corresponding to the
pulsar PSR J0740+6620 [54, 55], while the dotted and dash-
dotted lines refer to the pulsar PSR J0030+0451 [56, 57]. In
all cases, the outer and inner lines corresponding to 1σ and
2σ intervals, respectively. Colors code: same notation as in
Fig. 1.
The MR curves have stable segments that fall within
the 95% confidence intervals for the masses and radii
of the pulsars PSR J0740+6620 [54, 55, 76] and PSR
J0030+0451 [56,57].
In Fig. 4 the radial profiles for 2.2 solar masses of
each parameterization are depicted. The figure shows
how pressure is distributed within the HS as a function
of the radial coordinate. The maximum central pres-
sure is obtained for m = 390 MeV and the minimum is
achieved for m = 300 MeV. It is observed a monotonic
decreasing with the value of the constituent quark mass.
In those curves are marked with a black circle to the
radial position where the deconfinement hadron quark
occurs for each parameterization. In Table 2, the masses
and radii of the quark core for each constituent quark
mass are listed.
5 Summary and concluding remarks
In this work, we analyzed HS properties with a D3-
D7/NL3* model. The quark phase was described by a
D3-D7 brane configuration. In this holographic model,
the constituent quark mass is a free parameter and,
