parameter is governed by a strong hydrogen bond O1-H10…O2b, which is not affected by the 
decrease in temperature movement of the atoms. The remaining two lattice parameters decrease 
with a temperature of about 1% of their length.  
The more precise low-temperature measurement also allows us to evaluate the quality of 2-
AmpH2PO3 crystal. When the chirality of the crystal results exclusively from the symmetry 
operations of the space group, the possibility of twinning by inversion needs to be investigated. 
The absolute structure parameter (Flack parameter) 0.06(10) obtained in work [23] at 273 K 
does not exclude the occurrence of the inversion twins due to its large estimated standard 
deviation (esd); our value -0.05(3) at 150 K is witnessing the pure chirality character of the 
crystal and agrees with the observed morphology of its large specimens (see Chapter 2.4.).  
The results of our crystallographic study demonstrate that both polymorphs 2-AmpHSO4 (I) 
and 2-AmpHSO4 (II) crystallise in the monoclinic space group P21/c. However, their crystal 
packing is entirely different.  
The crystal structure of 2-AmpHSO4 (I) (presented for the first time in ref. [50]) consists of 
alternating 2-aminopyrimidium(1+) cations and hydrogen sulfate anions interconnected by an 
extensive network of hydrogen bonds of N-H…O (donor-acceptor distance ranging from 
2.702(2) to 3.009(2) Å) and O-H…N type (donor-acceptor distance equal to 2.652(2) Å). 
Moreover, weak hydrogen bonds C3-H3…O3c and C4-H4…O2c were also found in the 
structure (see Fig. 4 and Table S7, Supplementary material). Interionic hydrogen bonding of 
cations and anions leads to ring pattern formation described by graph-set descriptors

are also involved in the 3D packing 
of this polymorph. 
In contrast, the crystal structure of the 2-AmpHSO4 (II) polymorph (presented for the first 
time in ref. [51]) is based on chains formed along the b-axis (graph-set descriptor

The asymmetric unit of monoclinic (space group P21/n) crystals of (2-Amp)2SO4H2O 
contains two 2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) cations, sulfate anion and a water molecule, see Fig.
