1 Introduction
High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have garnered signiﬁcant attention in materials science
due to their diverse and versatile functionalities, including exceptional mechanical
strength, corrosion resistance, energy storage capabilities, magnetic refrigeration, soft
ferromagnetism, catalytic potential, and thermoelectricity[1–12]. The deﬁning feature
of HEAs lies in the incorporation of multiple principal elements with high mixing
entropy values. According to thermodynamic theory, higher mixing entropy stabilizes
solid solution phases, particularly at elevated temperatures. Many researchers adopt a
threshold mixing entropy value of 1.0 R (R: gas constant) for HEAs, typically achieved
by including at least four constituent elements[13]. The HEA concept has been exten-
sively explored across various materials, with high-entropy materials broadly classiﬁed
into two categories: high-entropy alloys and high-entropy compounds. Unlike conven-
tional alloys, which are predominantly composed of one or two principal elements,
HEAs exhibit distinctive ”four core eﬀects”: the high-entropy eﬀect, severe lattice
distortion, sluggish diﬀusion, and the cocktail eﬀect[1, 2]. Another remarkable charac-
teristic of HEAs is their multifunctionality[14]. Multiple functionalities can coexist in
HEAs, such as the combination of high strength and ductility or soft magnetism and
corrosion resistance[15, 16], which is rarely achieved in conventional alloys.
Superconductivity has emerged as one of the intriguing functionalities explored
in HEAs since the discovery of the body-centered cubic (bcc) Ta34Nb33Hf8Zr14Ti11
superconductor in 2014[17–21]. Presently, HEA superconductivity is studied across
diverse structural types, including bcc[22–32], hexagonal close-packed (hcp)[33–35],
face-centered cubic (fcc)[36, 37], CsCl-type[38], A15[39], NaCl-type[40], α (or β)-Mn-
type[41, 42], σ-phase type[43], CuAl2-type[44], NiAs-type[45], BiS2-based[46], and
YBCO-based[47] structures. The bcc, hcp, and fcc HEAs are classiﬁed as alloy-
type, while the remaining structures fall under high-entropy compounds. Several key
ﬁndings have been reported in HEA superconductors, including the robustness of
superconductivity against high pressures and irradiation, the cocktail eﬀect, and the
enhancement of the upper critical ﬁeld induced by the high-entropy eﬀect[45, 46, 48–
52]. For instance, the bcc (TaNb)0.67(HfZrTi)0.33 alloy demonstrates the robustness of
superconductivity under high pressures[48], with a superconducting critical tempera-
ture (Tc=8 K) remaining constant even under extreme pressures of up to 180 GPa.
The cocktail eﬀect, one of the four core eﬀects, refers to a synergistic phenomenon
where physical properties surpass the average values predicted by the mixture rule.
This eﬀect has been observed in BiS2-based superconductors, where increasing mixing
entropy enhances the diamagnetic signal[46]. More recently, an enhancement of the
zero-temperature upper critical ﬁeld, µ0Hc2(0), with increasing mixing entropy has
been reported in NiAs-type (RuRhPdIr)1−xPtxSb[45]. As the Pt content decreases
from x=1 to x=0.2, µ0Hc2(0) increases signiﬁcantly from 0.07 T to 1.33 T.
The exploration of practical applications for HEA superconductors is critically
important for advancing superconducting technology. Notable properties such as
high critical current density, exceptional hardness, and the shape memory eﬀect are
impressive[29, 49, 53]. The latter two features are especially promising for develop-
ing multifunctional superconducting devices[29, 53]. Several body-centered cubic (bcc)
