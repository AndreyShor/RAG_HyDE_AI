The second approach involves constructing a variation by parallel transporting a deterministic curve v(t) in
the tangent space of a such that v(0) = v(T) = 0 for some T > 0, along the process Γ. This is used in case of
geodesically complete manifolds, for instance, in the works of Arnaudon, Chen and Cruzeiro [18] for Lie groups,
and Huang and Zambrini [21] for compact manifolds. The adaptedness of the variation is ensured by placing
future conditions only on deterministic objects. Note that in this approach the final time is fixed and independent
of the process. A related approach which considers a fixed final time is the use of Malliavin calculus. We refer
the interested reader to Cruzeiro et. al. [8] for more details. While this approach does not involve choosing a
compact set and it accounts for a deterministic final time T, it involves more structure on the manifold.
Fixing the final time t = T in the stochastic setting leads to local problems. To elaborate on this, first consider
the case of deterministic Euler-Lagrange equations. Recall that the proof of the equivalence of Hamilton’s principle
and Euler-Lagrange equations in manifolds, using partial derivatives of the form ∂L
∂q and ∂L
∂˙q (see, for instance,
Marsden and Ratiu [11], Theorem 8.1.3 and its proof) proceeds in local coordinates, by dividing the curve q(t)
into a finite number of segments, each of which lies in a chart. For any chart U such that U has a non-empty
intersection with the curve q(t), one can find a time interval [t0, t1] such that q(t) lies in U for t ∈[t0, t1]. Roughly
speaking, global fixed endpoint problems, with fixed initial and final times, lead to local fixed endpoints problems
with fixed inital and final times.
But this is not the case if one considers a semimartingale Γ instead of a deterministic curve. Spatial localization
of a semimartingale in charts leads to temporal localization within stopping times. This means that if U ⊆M is a
chart, the first hitting time of Γ in U and the first exit time from U are (random) stopping times. Thus, globally
considering a fixed endpoint problem with a final time T > 0 does not lead to fixed endpoint problems locally
with a fixed final time. Therefore, should we want to do local computations with fixed endpoint conditions it is
necessary that we construct variations that vanish at t = 0, t = T, as well as at the first hitting time and the
first exit time. The first two conditions are necessary since U may contain the initial condition, or the exit time
from U may exceed T.
A main objective of this paper is to introduce variations of semimartingales that vanish not only at initial
and final deterministic times but also at the first hitting and exit times for a chart in a manifold. This allows us
to do variational principles in local coordinates on a manifolds.
We also describe a novel method for working with variational principles globally on manifolds. We exploit
the fact that Stratonovich equations on manifolds are determined by Stratonovich operators and these are deter-
ministic generalizations of vector fields. By restricting the action integral to solutions of Stratonovich equations
and assuming the noise to be an arbitrary semimartingale, we reformulate the problem of finding critical points
of a stochastic action to determining a Stratonovich operator. Since the Stratonovich operator is a deterministic
object, this suggests that the problem is solvable by deterministic arguments. We demonstrate that this is indeed
the case, and in fact, this method allows us to bypass some of the complications that arise in the local case while
working globally.
This paper is structured as follows: after reviewing some terminologies and notations from stochastic calculus
in Section 2, we introduce variations of semimartingales in Section 3. We prove a stochastic analogue of the
fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations as well for Stratonovich integrals, especially taking into account
variations that vanish at the first hitting and exit times for a chart. In Section 4 we turn our focus on the stochastic
Hamilton-Pontryagin principle. The stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle was formulated by Bou-Rabee and
Owhadi [5] and studied more recently by Street and Takao [1]. As an application of the variational framework
developed in Section 3, a proof of the local form of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle is presented.
This generalizes the Hamilton-Pontryagin principle formulated in [1] to arbitrary noise semimartingales. Then we
discuss the intrinsic form of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle by working at the level of Stratonovich
operators.

Notations and Terminologies from Stochastic Calculus
We will always consider continuous semimartingales defined on a probability space (Ω, F, P). If S, T are pre-
dictable stopping times then we define
[[S, T]] = {(ω, t) ∈Ω× [0, ∞) | S(ω) ≤t ≤T(ω)}
[[S, T[[ = {(ω, t) ∈Ω× [0, ∞) | S(ω) ≤t < T(ω)}
]]S, T]] = {(ω, t) ∈Ω× [0, ∞) | S(ω) < t ≤T(ω)}
