We require that the right-hand side of the equation, including f(σ1, σ2),
remain invariant under volume-preserving deformations (VPD)12131415. On the
other hand, we require that the gauge parameters Q1 and Q2 do not depend on
the integration constant f 16.
Under this requirement, the volume-preserving deformation is subject to the
following constraints:
∂τ(Q1, Q2)
∂σ3
= 0,
(B.11)
{Q1, Q2} = 0,
(B.12)
∂
∂σ3
∂Q1,2
∂σa
= 0.
(B.13)
These constraints on the gauge parameters are both necessary and suﬃcient
conditions for preserving the gauge restriction condition.
We refer to the volume-preserving deformations that satisfy these constraints
as Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations (RVPD).
12The fact that f(σ1, σ2) is arbitrary—provided it is suﬃciently smooth and satisﬁes
appropriate boundary conditions—plays a key role in deriving strong constraints such as
{Q1, Q2} = 0 later in the analysis. In the following sections, we carefully track where and
how this arbitrariness is used throughout the calculations.
13In this work, we impose strong constraints on the gauge parameters Q1 and Q2 in order to
preserve all possible choices of f(σ1, σ2). This is not merely a technical requirement to ensure
consistency of the gauge condition, but rather a necessary condition to deﬁne the algebraic
structure and composition law of the restricted volume-preserving deformation (RVPD) in a
precise and consistent manner. In particular, as shown in the main text, under the conditions
such as {Q1, Q2} = 0 and ∂σ3τ(Q1, Q2) = 0, the deformation closes algebraically, ensuring
that the structure remains intact even after quantization or matrix regularization. Thus, the
very policy of preserving all choices of f becomes the key to achieving consistency between
the algebraic structure and physical content of the theory.
In this way, the requirement
that the gauge condition be preserved for every f should not be viewed as a demand to
leave f unchanged, but rather as a natural condition to obtain a closed deformation algebra
corresponding to RVPD.
14It is important to emphasize that, in the expression CIXI =
1
2(σ3)2 + f(σ1, σ2) used
in this work, we are not choosing a particular function f0 for the purpose of gauge ﬁxing.
Instead, f(σ1, σ2) is treated as an arbitrary allowed function, and only those gauge transfor-
mations that preserve all such possible functions are considered. This is the reason why strong
constraints such as {Q1, Q2} = 0 arise. As noted earlier, these constraints play a crucial role
in maintaining stability under quantization (i.e., matrix regularization) and preserving the
underlying algebraic structure.
15Note that any speciﬁc solution XI(σ1, σ2, σ3) satisﬁes the gauge condition CIXI =
1
2(σ3)2 + f(σ1, σ2) for some particular choice of f, but not for all f simultaneously.
In
this paper, we only allow deformations (i.e., RVPD) that preserve all possible f, so that the
physical structure remains consistent regardless of which gauge-ﬁxing surface (i.e., which f)
a solution belongs to. The function f associated with a given solution is determined by the
initial or boundary conditions of XI, and the theoretical framework is constructed under the
assumption that f is arbitrary.
16This is because, if Q depends on f, the argument for preserving all possible f simultane-
ously would become self-referential and logically circular.
