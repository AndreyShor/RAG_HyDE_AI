principle, the introduction of a moir´e potential with period λm in aligned R5G/BN superlattice not
only induces moir´e bands which are displaced in the momentum by km = 2π/λm, but also might
lead to modification of the flat band through the intricate interaction (Fig. 1c).
In order to experimentally resolve the electronic structure of R5G and to evaluate the effect of
moir´e potential on the flat band electronic structure, we have constructed two types of delicately-
designed samples for NanoARPES measurements — non-aligned R5G/BN samples and aligned
R5G/BN with a large moir´e period of 14.0 nm. Figure 1d-e shows characterizations of the high-
quality aligned R5G/BN sample S1. The R5G graphene is isolated from Bernal stacking graphene
(BG) to avoid relaxation into BG during sample transfer and thermal annealing (see Extended
Data Fig. 1), and connected to Au electrodes (see optical image in Fig. 1d) for NanoARPES mea-
surements. The rhombohedral stacking is confirmed by scanning near-field optical microscopy
(SNOM) measurements38,39 shown in Fig. 1e. The good alignment between R5G and BN sub-
strate is further supported by lateral-force atomic force microscopy (L-AFM) measurement shown
in Fig. 1f (Extended Data Fig. 2 for more data), which shows a clear moir´e superlattice with a
uniform period of λm = 14.0 ± 0.3 nm, comparable to that of aligned R5G/BN exhibiting FQAHE
effect1,2.
Flat band electronic structure of non-aligned R5G/BN and key hopping parameters
We first focus on the electronic structure of non-aligned R5G/BN (sample S2 and S3 with
twist angles of 36◦and 42◦, respectively; see Extended Data Fig. 3) to reveal the intrinsic electronic
structure of R5G. Figure 2a shows an overview of the electronic structure near the K point, which
