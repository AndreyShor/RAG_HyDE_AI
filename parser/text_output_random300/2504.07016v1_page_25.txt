entanglement entropy and how it behaves under changes in the cutoff. The presence of univer-
sal terms—particularly in scenarios where the boundary deformation includes cusps—introduces
additional log-divergences, whose coefficients are often of physical significance. A more detailed
treatment of these divergences could provide further insight into the universality of our reconstruc-
tion procedure.
Beyond leading-order corrections, a natural extension of our approach is to reconstruct the full
function f(z) ≈1 rather than just its perturbation δf(z). The limit of the iterative formula (5.11),
which is just the full f(z), suggests that, in principle, the entire black hole metric (3.40) could be
reconstructed, particularly in the regime where zH ≫1 (or equivalently, at low temperatures). This
would provide a more complete picture of the emergent bulk spacetime from boundary data.
Several directions remain for future work. One important path is to understand how uncertain-
ties in the boundary data propagate to the reconstructed δf [19], which is essential for practical
applications. Another promising direction is the extension of our method to time-dependent se-
tups, such as holographic quenches [37], where the HRT prescription replaces the Ryu–Takayanagi
formula. This would allow us to explore the dynamical aspects of bulk reconstruction and their
implications for nonequilibrium holography.
Finally, while our work represents an early step in understanding bulk reconstruction from
a mathematical perspective, it opens the door to further refinements and generalizations.
By
incorporating more sophisticated mathematical tools and addressing these open questions, we hope
to move closer to a more complete picture of how spacetime emerges from field theory data.

Synthetic data
In this appendix we will generate the boundary data that can be used to infer the corresponding
metric deformation in the bulk spacetime. We will focus on three-dimensional CFTs and obtain
the change in the entanglement entropy for disks of radii R with an infinitesimal temperature
deformation about zero temperature.
Consider the minimal surface in the metric (3.41) anchored on a disk of radius R on the
boundary. In cylindrical coordinates (u, ϕ, z) related to the Cartesian coordinates by
x = u cos ϕ ,
y = u sin ϕ ,
z = z ,
