A shortcut to the double box
In the preceding section we have learned that it is possible to locate a particular Taylor component of the sum
(52) in the Laurent expansion of the associated Euler integral J21. Suppose that this is not a coincidence, but
rather a general feature. Now, the sum
Ë†I2,1 = âˆ’

Î“[1 + n4]Î“[1 + n4 + 2 Î³]Î“[1 + n6]Î“[1 + n6 + 2 Î´]
(72)
has the identical Î± Î² Î³ Î´ component.
Yet, the Euler integral from summing over residues is only two-fold
because both, the n4 as well as the n6 sums are of 2F1 type. From the two distinct Euler representations found
by starting on P n4 we choose the one with only one coordinate-dependent factor:
Ë†I2,1 = âˆ’

(74)
with Ïƒ = Î± + Î². There is no need for any additional regulator because all necessary factors are present
and carry non-integer parts in their exponents. The intersection theory problem for the new integral is much
simpler than before: there are only two variables to integrate out, and the matrices involve only three regulator
parameters. Defining
p5 = 1 âˆ’s âˆ’s z Â¯z + s2 z Â¯z + s t âˆ’s t z âˆ’s t Â¯z + s t z Â¯z
(75)
a suitable basis is

where the last two elements are a basis for the inner integration, for which we select the variable t. The
problem linearises at the second level, like it did for the r-integration that we tackled last in the previous
section. We list the intersection matrices, the second level connection, and the Pfaffian matrices in Appendix
B. Conveniently, there are only the five letters {z, 1 âˆ’z, Â¯z, 1 âˆ’Â¯z, z âˆ’Â¯z} so that a fibration basis Ga[z]Gb[Â¯z] is
sufficient in which the weight vector a has entries from the smaller set {0, 1, Â¯z}, and b is composed of {0, 1}
again.
Rescaling Ïƒ â†’ÏƒÏµ, Î³ â†’Î³Ïµ, Î´ â†’Î´Ïµ the equations are linear in Ïµ. Once again, the constant order implies
that the master integrals have rational denominators:
Ë†d2,1 = {z âˆ’Â¯z, 1, 1, (1 âˆ’z)(1 âˆ’Â¯z)}
(77)
Transforming to pure functions we obtain canonical equations wrt. to Ïµ whose iteration starts on

We remark that the order counting is similar to the more complicated case in the last section: the integral
Ë†J2,1 has two denominator Î“ functions singular in Ïµ (not four). Scaling up the result for master 1 by the factors
Ïµ2(Ïƒ âˆ’Î³ + Î´)(Ïƒ âˆ’Î³ âˆ’Î´), the polylogarithm level 4 once again comes with monomials of total order four in
the regulator parameters, or of total order five, but divided by Î³. For the Î± Î² Î³ Î´ component of Ë†I2,1 we find
exactly the same symbol as for I2,1, while the entire calculation requires nearly no computing resources!
We can modify I2,2 in a similar fashion:
Ë†I2,2

Summing over n4 first we find four Euler representations, of which we pick
