between hot excitons and electrons. As the excess energy exceeds the capacity of the 
Fermi sea, other dissipation channels such as the electron-phonon scatterings become 
more involved, which will lead to a reduced hot-electron extraction efficiency at high 
pump fluence. In contrast, for neutral MoSe2, hot electrons arise from Auger 
recombination of excitons, in which increasing initial exciton density leads to more 
efficient generation of hot electrons.  
Lastly, for shedding light on the impact of the conduction band offset, we explore the 
electric field dependence of the hot-electron extraction with doped and neutral MoSe2, 
as shown in Figure 5a and b, respectively. For both doped and neutral MoSe2, as 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸 
increases and thus ΔC  decreases, 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 shows overall increase and slower decay 
dynamics. This can be understood as follows. Reducing ΔC gives rise to more hot 
electrons that have enough kinetic energy to transfer to WS2, and less driving force for 
the electron transfer from WS2 back to MoSe2. Worthy to note, the electron transfer 
back to MoSe2 will only slightly modify the decay dynamics of AM, instead of leading 
to any rise, owing to other overwhelming processes in MoSe2, such as the 
recombination of electron-hole pairs. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5c,d, the maximum 
of 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 shows linear dependence within a wide range of 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸, indicated by dashed lines. 
This is distinct from the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling for the devices with thick hBN 
barrier29–32 wherein the tunneling current is highly nonlinear with the bias voltage29, 
which means that, in this work, hot electrons in MoSe2 directly tunnel to WS2, without
