Figure 8. (a) A large-scale view of our target site is shown using a two-color composite image. Colors red and green present the
MeerKAT 1.3 GHz radio continuum emission and 13CO(J = 3–2) moment-0 map, respectively. The radio continuum emission
is displayed on a linear scale from 5σ to 100σ, where 1σ ∼20 µJy beam−1. The moment-0 map is shown on a linear scale from
3σ to 30σ, where 1σ ∼0.36 K km s−1. The white dotted rectangle indicates the area shown in Figure 1a. A scale bar of 15
pc is marked in this panel. (b) This panel presents a similar two-color composite image as panel “a,” with red representing
the MIPSGAL 24 µm image. The MIPSGAL image is displayed on a logarithmic scale, ranging from 25 to 200 MJy sr−1.
The distribution of the ATLASGAL clumps for different velocity ranges and distances is indicated using various symbols, as
described in the figure. The extent of a candidate H ii region from Anderson et al. (2014) is marked with a dotted circle in each
panel.
