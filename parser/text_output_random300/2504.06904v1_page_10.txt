4. DETERMINATION OF ANALYTICAL 
EXPRESSION BASED ON WHICH ACCIDENTS 
AND TECHNOLOGICAL REGIMES ARE 
SELECTED FOR DISPATCHER STATIONS 
The variation in pressure in a gas pipeline can result 
from both changes in the amount of gas supplied to 
consumers, the opening and closing of valves in the 
pipeline, and the operation of various elements within the 
pipeline. As a result, technological processes cause 
changes in pressure at the beginning and end sections of 
the gas pipeline. One of the most important tasks of 
operational control in gas pipeline technological regimes 
is to identify critical conditions in gas supply systems at 
dispatcher stations. For instance, pressure variations at 
the end sections of the pipeline can occur as a result of 
changes in technological regimes. Therefore, it is 
essential to prioritize understanding the pressure changes 
resulting from technological processes in the event of 
accidents. 
The initial model of events and processes occurring in 
gas transmission systems is not always accurately 
represented with high precision. Therefore, to solve the 
problems of operational management of gas transmission 
systems, it is necessary to use analytical expressions to 
assess the real situation of gas transmission systems. 
Having a mathematical expression allows for selecting 
the parameters and control structures of the pipeline, 
determining optimality criteria and constraints, assessing 
accuracy, selecting appropriate technical control devices, 
and so on. 
To solve the problems of managing trunk gas 
pipelines, it is necessary to understand the non-stationary 
dynamic characteristics of these systems. It is appropriate 
to utilize the formalization of technological and accident 
processes for the transportation of gas in pipeline 
systems. By employing the method of describing accident 
processes, it is possible to obtain unit characteristics. 
Based on theoretical research, the following inequality 
has been determined.

It has been determined that if the function p(t) 
satisfies the conditions of the inequality mentioned 
above, the variation of pressure over time corresponds to 
the lawfulness characterizing accidents in the gas 
pipeline, otherwise, it is the result of technological 
processes. Therefore, the function p(t) is a reliable 
parameter that enables dispatchers to make timely 
decisions for the efficient management of the gas 
pipeline. At the point where time t=t1 is fixed, the value 
of θ\theta and the obtained values of the function p(t) are 
reliable information for the dispatcher station. This is 
because the accuracy of determining the leakage location 
is characterized by the moment t=t1. To visualize the 
methodology, we use the flow diagram below.

On the other hand, for the reliability and effectiveness 
of automatic detection of the accident location in online 
mode, these parameters are useful. For instance, if 
pressure changes are observed in the initial and final
