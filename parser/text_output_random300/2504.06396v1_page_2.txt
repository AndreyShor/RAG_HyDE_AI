development of synthetic models, or test cases, provides a strong foundation for advancing practical
algorithms that can, in turn, strengthen the cybersecurity of real-world power grid systems.
By building synthetic cyber-physical models, researchers can leverage these datasets to develop
and test new applications. These models also serve educational purposes, offering an intuitive way
to explore various cyber-physical scenarios. Additionally, they enable visualization techniques
that enhance understanding of cyber-physical interactions and system behavior under different
adversarial actions.
The availability of test cases with realistic cyber-physical topology is limited. Some cyber-physical
models are restricted to distribution systems or smaller IEEE test cases [8, 31]. A power distribution
cyber-physical test case presented in [18] considers the correlation between cyber and physical
systems by covering a range of power generation and load variations. The 8-substation model [28]
is an early example of a cyber-physical test case that models an electrical transmission system,
following the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9-bus model.
A large-scale cyber-physical model was proposed in [30], based on the Texas 2000-bus system.
More recently, a statistics-based cyber-physical topology for the European power grid was intro-
duced in [19]. This model addresses the scalability challenges of representing large cyber-physical
networks by incorporating three distinct layers: the power system layer, the communication layer
(which includes physical devices such as fiber optic switches), and the logical communication layer
(which accounts for network routers). The tool also introduces redundant communication nodes
within the communication layer to enhance reliability. However, this model does not capture data
flows or the communication protocols used in utilities’ Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) systems, and it supports only a single network topology.
In this paper, the creation of a cyber-physical model of a power grid is automated. The goal
of this approach is to take any power system network model as input and generate a realistic
communication topology that overlays the physical power system layer. This topology is designed
to be valid alongside the power system model for joint simulation and/or emulation. It can also be
customized based on the specific use cases being studied.
To demonstrate this, cyber-physical topologies are generated and validated using metrics for
three synthetic power grid models, with bus sizes ranging from 500 to 10,000. These cyber-physical
models include relays, substations, Utility Control Centers (UCC), and Balancing Authorities (BA),
developed based on the approach in [30]. Creating such a versatile framework holds substantial
promise for advancing the field of power grid modeling and enhancing cyber-physical system
integration. Specifically, the creation of these cyber-physical synthetic grid models is of crucial
importance for the development and validation of novel applications in power system critical
infrastructure defense including cyber-physical situational awareness techniques and intrusion
response engines.
In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:
• The work presents SAM-GT, a scalable turn-key approach for generating large-scale realistic
cyber-physical models. The model generation tool produces a large-scale cyber-physical
power system model, with a detailed cyber layer which is overlayed and connected with
the large-scale electric power system model.
• SAM-GT creates object-oriented data structures for representing the system within and
between different power system levels (e.g., substations, utilities, and balancing authorities),
where the communication layer models real-world data flows and operations.
• SAM-GT models the data flows and operations using different communication protocols
that would be found at different levels and in different geographical/ownership regions of a
power system.
