FIG. 20. An agent interacting with the cascade of two environment channel env1 and env2.
To this end, recall that any agtM →
←env can be represented through a finite-state global Markov process of some
agtM →
←envM which models agtM →
←env, see lemma 4. By corollary 1, this process is asymptotically periodic with a
finite period in the sense of corollary 1. Let d be this period. That is, there are only d asymptotically expected
input distributions for the agent’s transition matrix, lim
n→∞pMdn+cSdn+c for c ∈{1, 2, . . . , d}, which repeat in the same
periodic manner. We will now exploit this to construct a Landauer-efficient agent.
Let us extend the agent agtM by a separate deterministic counter c which starts at 1 and, with every round, if c < d
counts up or if c = d resets to 1. This additional counter memory is fully deterministic and thus has zero entropy for
all times. It therefore does not contribute to the extractable work.
Now, consider a protocol implementing the agent which, conditioned on the counter c, implements one of d efficient
protocols optimized for the asymptotically expected distribution lim
n→∞pMdn+cSdn+c. Thereby, we have constructed a
protocol which implements agtM in a Landauer-efficient way using only finite memory.

Definition and properties of work capacity
For a given environment, the extracted work in eq. (G12) depends not only on an agent’s input-output behavior,
as characterized by an agent’s channel agt, but also on the agent’s memory usage, as specified by a model agtM. The
environment’s capacity to do work is then defined as the supremum of the work rate with respect to all agent models
agtM.
Definition 13. The work capacity Cwork of channel env = νenv
A|S is defined as
Cwork(env) :=
max
agtM∈A→
←env W(agtM →
←env)
(G13)
where W(agtM →
←env) := ⟨H (At|Mt) −H (St|Mt)⟩t is the work rate. An agent model agtM is said to be efficient
with respect to an environment channel env if W(agtM →
←env) = Cwork(env) and the set of efficient agents is denoted
A
→
←env
eff
.
In the following we will prove various properties of work capacity.
Theorem 8. For any percept-action loop agtM →
←env with action-percept alphabet Y, the channel capacity Cwork(env)
has the following properties:
(i) (Existence) The limit in the definition of Cwork(env) exists,
(ii) (Bounds) 0 ≤Cwork(env) ≤ln |Y|,
(iii) (Subadditivity under channel cascade) Let env1 = penv1
S|A and env2 = penv2
S|A be two hidden Markov channels.
Define the cascade env2 ◦env1 = penv2◦env1
S|A
of env1 and env2 as
penv2◦env1
S|A
(s|a) =
X
i∈YN0
penv2
S|A′(s|i)penv1
S′|A(i|a),
(G14)
see also Figure 20. Then,
Cwork(env2 ◦env1) ≤Cwork(env1) + Cwork(env2).
