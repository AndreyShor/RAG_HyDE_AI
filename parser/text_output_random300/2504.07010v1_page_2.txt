. Measuring a qubit can only produce two outcomes,
0 with probability α2 and 1 with probability β2, and destroys the superposi-
tion (by setting either α or β to 0). If the qubit is entangled with another,
measuring the first may affect the (unmeasured) state of the second. A quan-
tum circuit consists of a series of matrix operators acting on |ψ⟨before it is
measured.
are computationally expansive and become unreliable for deep circuits, i.e.
circuits with many qubits.
Existing Machine Learning (ML) methods to
improve them (Harper et al., 2020; Canonici et al., 2024) often rely on un-
verifiable assumptions, e.g. the specific type of quantum noise affecting the
device (Google, 2023; Van Den Berg et al., 2023; Rajeev, 2024; McEwen et al.,
2022; Thorbeck et al., 2023). They also depend on the model architecture
and training (Nguyen et al., 2021; Tindall et al., 2024; Patra et al., 2024)
and have theoretical success guarantees only in the limit of infinite sam-
ples (Zheng et al., 2023). Uncertainty estimation methods like Caro et al.
(2022) or Park and Simeone (2023)mostly focus on Quantum ML applica-
tions and can be hardly extended to more general tasks. In particular, it
is unclear whether such Quantum ML approaches can directly estimate the
output of a given s-qubit quantum device, which is a multivariate discrete
distribution over Y = {0, 1}s. Using black-box ML methods for data-driven
characterizations of QC hardware noise is a relatively new but promising
idea. Martina et al. (2022) and Canonici et al. (2024) show that quantum
noise is rich enough to provide a unique fingerprint of a QC machine. The
result is obtained from real hardware data but for small circuits (4 qubits).
Does the provided noise characterization still hold when the size of the cir-
cuits increases, e.g. when s crosses the boundary of the so-called Quantum
