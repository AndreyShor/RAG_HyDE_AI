dtR(Xt) = |∇R|2(Xt), t ≥0.
Therefore, R is monotonic increasing in time t, R(Xt) ↗Rmax, the maximum being
attained on our ellipse ξ = ξ0 as our elliptical spiral, Xt, converges to where |∇R|2 = 0.
The only singularity here being on the line of join of the two foci A1 and A2 and only
emerging from our elliptical solutions.

S is clearly dependent on elliptic integrals (see Byrd and Friedman, Ref. [5]). We shall
elaborate on this later.
For now notice that generally the roots, cosh ξ, of the quartic equation,
E cosh2 ξ + (µ1 + µ2)

cosh ξ −γ = 0,
determine the elliptical boundaries of the annular region to which our particle motion in
the classical potential V is confined. The condition for this classical orbit to be elliptical
is that the above quadratic has equal roots, the ellipse having the two centres as foci.
Setting γ = α2
