where U is Tricomi’s confluent hypergeometric function. When l = 0, and using the
identity U(a, a+1, x) = x−a [21], we can confirm that our distribution is a unit measure.
For the mean (l = 1), we use that U(a, b, x) ∼x−a [21] asymptotically as x →∞. In
our case, this would correspond to n, m →∞, and so
E[λ1] ∼√µ −αρ = 22/3n1/6p
22/3n2/3 −α ∼2√n,
(B.5)
for n →∞. For whenever min(κ1) < 0, we verified numerically in Fig. 4 that the
expressions 16 and 18 still yield accurate results for the mean and variance when using
the principal branch of the Tricomi function [21]. Note that the principal branch is
used automatically when no specific determination is made in the SciPy package. It is
also important to emphasise that when numerically calculating either the PDF of the
distribution itself or its moments, the terms being multiplied together in the expressions
are very varied in magnitude, leading to significant errors in computation.
This
sometimes requires the extra step of using arbitrary floating point precision arithmetic.
In this Appendix we have derived a novel approximate distribution for the largest
singular value of uncorrelated Ginibre matrices using an approximation for the largest
eigenvalue of Wishart matrices [17]. We have also validated that errors are small when
using the derived approximation. This is true even for the small values of n, m, and
the accuracy improves quickly as the size of the matrix grows, as left tail errors in
fκ1 (see Fig. B2), and subsequently fλ1, shrink rapidly. Our approximations in this
Appendix yield a novel and computationally easier way to calculate accurate singular
value statistics for real and complex Ginibre ensemble matrices.
