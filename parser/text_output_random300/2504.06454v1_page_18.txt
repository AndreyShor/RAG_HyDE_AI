and Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2, where the eﬀect originates from the small-size normal core
pinning[81, 82]. Signiﬁcantly, the high-ﬁeld Jc at 2 K in the annealed sample surpasses
the practical level 105 A/cm2. The symmetric Fp/Fp,max curves of the as-cast sam-
ple are well-ﬁtted by the function h0.45(1-h)0.45. In contrast, for the sample annealed
at 500 ◦C, the curves are better described by h4.92(1-h)2.39, contrasting sharply with
high-Tc superconductors such as YBCO and Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2[81, 82]. This suggests
that the present HEA possesses multiple pinning mechanisms. The reduction in lat-
tice parameter during annealing supports the presence of lattice strain akin to that
observed in Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6, which likely enhances Jc, particularly at lower
magnetic ﬁelds. In (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5, clusters precipitated from the HEA, measur-
ing approximately 10 nm, are also observed. This nanostructure is reminiscent of α-Ti
precipitates in Nb-Ti and may play a crucial role in the ﬁshtail eﬀect, contributing to
the improved high-ﬁeld magnetic performance of Jc. Thus, the lattice parameter and
microstructure of thermally annealed (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 provide valuable insights
for its potential application as a superconducting wire.
5 NbScTiZr
NbScTiZr exhibits an eutectic microstructure, distinguishing it from conventional Nb-
Ti alloys. Notably, the Tc of NbScTiZr is relatively higher than those of typical HEA
superconductors, which can be partially attributed to the lattice strain induced by its
ﬁne eutectic structure. In practical superconducting wires, a multiﬁlamentary struc-
ture is employed to mitigate the thermal instability of the superconducting state. The
ﬁne eutectic microstructure can be considered an inherent multiﬁlamentary structure,
representing one of the distinctive features of eutectic HEAs.
5.1 Eutectic microstructure
A eutectic alloy is deﬁned as a homogeneous mixture with a melting point lower than
those of its constituent phases. During solidiﬁcation, two distinct solid phases emerge
simultaneously, forming a characteristic microstructure, such as a lamellar arrange-
ment. Eutectic HEAs have garnered signiﬁcant attention as structural materials due to
their potential to overcome the conventional strength-ductility trade-oﬀ[15, 83]. The
fcc HEAs typically exhibit high ductility but low strength, whereas many bcc HEAs
demonstrate high strength but poor ductility. Consequently, eutectic HEAs comprising
both fcc and bcc phases achieve a balance of high strength and ductility.
In superconductors, the presence of eutectic phases often modiﬁes the supercon-
ducting properties. For instance, an enhancement in Tc due to eutectic microstructures
has been reported in materials such as Sr2RuO4, YIr2, and Zr5Pt3Ox[84–86]. How-
ever, the inﬂuence of eutectic microstructures on Jc remains relatively underexplored.
A rare example is the as-cast V1−xZrx alloy superconductors reported in 2019[87].
The highest Jc was observed in the x =0.4 sample, which consists of α-Zr, γ-ZrV2 and
γ’-ZrV2. The latter two intermetallic compounds belong to the C15 Laves phase fam-
ily, with slightly diﬀering chemical compositions. The eutectic microstructure arises
from α-Zr and γ-ZrV2. The V0.6Zr0.4 alloy exhibits superconductivity with Tc=8.5 K,
µ0Hc2(0)=17.5 T, and a self-ﬁeld Jc of 5×105 A/cm2 at 2 K.
