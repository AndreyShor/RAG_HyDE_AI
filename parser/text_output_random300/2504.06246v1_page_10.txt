than the original Hamiltonian, Eq. (3), resulting in
a Floquet Hamiltonian that encodes a redundancy in
the quasienergies and eigenvectors. We define the first
“Floquet-Brillouin zone” (FBZ) by the set of quasiener-
gies in the interval −ℏω/2 < E ≤ℏω/2 [10]. Any eigen-
vector of Eq. (6) with quasienergy outside the first FBZ
can be obtained from a state in the first FBZ with energy
shifted by mℏω. To simulate the system numerically, we
will truncate the Floquet Hamiltonian to a finite num-
ber (2M + 1) of Fourier coefficients. This is enabled by
the linear potential −mℏω in Eq. (6), which results in
localized eigenstates in the Fourier harmonic space. The
finite range ℓm of appreciable Fourier coefficients for the
Floquet eigenstates can be estimated as ℓm ∼W/(ℏω),
where W is the bandwidth, approximately given by the
largest one of H0 and V . The truncation will provide a
good approximation for the system far from the trunca-
tion boundaries if we take (2M + 1) ≫ℓm. For details,
see Ref. [10].
We
simulate
the
planar
SNS
system
using
the
Kwant [21] python package, where we take a tight-binding
approximation of Eq. (5) in a finite square lattice of
size L by Ly, where Ly = 2WS + WN, and truncate
the Floquet matrix to the M-th lowest Floquet side-
band, i.e., m, n ∈[−M, M].
At this point, with the
Floquet truncation and tight binding approximation, our
system is still computationally costly to solve numer-
ically for a realistic set of parameters.
Considering a
system of size L × Ly ∼1 µm × 1 µm and lattice con-
stant of order ∼1 nm, results in a ∼106-dimensional
Hamiltonian H0. Here, instead, we introduce an effective
Hamiltonian approach to solve the Floquet Hamiltonian
numerically. We choose an undriven SNS Hamiltonian
given by HSNS = H0 + V + V † and solve the eigen-
value problem numerically, finding N eigenvalues closest
to the Fermi level. Then, we project H0, V , and V † in
Eq. (5) on this reduced N-dimensional basis, which, com-
bined with the Floquet harmonics truncation, results in
a (2M +1)N-dimensional Floquet Hamiltonian. Alterna-
tively, we could have chosen another basis for the effective
Hamiltonian projection, such as the SN Hamiltonian H0
eigenstates. For sufficiently large N (we take N = 400),
both basis choices will result in indistinguishable results
for the low-energy (near Fermi level) properties.
By using the obtained eigenvectors and eigenstates, we
calculate the time-averaged density of states (DOS) de-
fined as [10]

where the sum over ν is over all the eigenvalues. Here
|ϕ(m)

By projecting the eigenvector to a small region on the
edge of the junction with the size determined by the
Fermi wavelength, we can obtain the local density of
states (LDOS) in the junction.
The LDOS with ω =
2eVJ/ℏis plotted in Figs. 3(c) and 5(a) of the main text.
For the LDOS simulation shown in this work, we
take the parameters WS = 300 nm, WN = 100 nm,
α = 2.5 meV nm, µ = 46.86 meV, µJ = 0.8µ, µSC = µ,
m∗= 0.036me, where me is the electron mass, and
lattice constant for the tight-binding approximation of
a = 5 nm.
To simulate the experimental system in
Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 5(a), we take ∆ind = 0.2 meV and
for the small coherence length calculation in Fig. 5(b)
we take ∆ind = 1.6 meV. For the energy and frequency
range studied in this work, we take the truncation for the
Floquet coefficients and effective Hamiltonian as M = 5
and N = 400, respectively.
The value of M is deter-
mined by taking the lowest frequency studied, setting
the correspondent energy to be of order ℏω ∼∆ind. The
cutoff for the effective Hamiltonian N sets the bandwidth
W ∼∆ind, resulting in localization range ℓm ∼1. There-
fore, the choice of M = 5 is sufficient to describe the low-
est frequency states (ω ≳0.5∆ind) in this work. For the
study of Floquet physics at lower frequencies, the range
ℓm would increase, and the truncation M should increase
accordingly.

CONDUCTANCE IN A
THREE-TERMINAL SYSTEM
We consider a three-terminal system composed of a
normal (N) lead and superconductor SC1 at voltages VB
and VJ, respectively, relative to a grounded superconduc-
tor SC2, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The differential conduc-
tance in the normal lead dIN/dVB will have contribu-
tions from two NS interfaces, each of which is described
by a low-temperature tunneling conductance given by
dINS/dV = GNNNBCS(e|V |)/NN [18], where V is the
voltage drop across the interface, GNN is the interface
normal state conductance (assumed constant in V ), and
NBCS(e|V |) and NN are the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer
(BCS) superconducting and normal state DOS, respec-
tively.
The BCS DOS can be written with the Dynes
formula [25, 26]
