(highly oscillating) and projection onto outgoing states Ψ(−) in red dashed solid
line and the WOM spectrum in thick solid green line (γ = 0.045 a.u. and n = 3).
Close up for the ranges (b) 0 < E < 0.05 near threshold and (c) 0.45 < E < 0.55

Vertical dash lines correspond to
Ramsauer-Townsend resonances, i.e., Ej = j2π2/(2a2) −V0 with V0 = Φ + EF .
Laser pulse parameters are F0 = 0.1 a.u., ω = 1 a.u., and τ = 40 a.u.
onto stationary eigenstates using Eq. (6) and the SPM. Unlike square-well potentials,
in the case of the BSB potential the scattering waves do not have any analytical
solution and are unknown [23]. In consequence, in order to implement the SPM we
must appeal to the procedure described in the appendix Appendix A (from step 1
