Figure 3.
The statistical astrometric properties of DR16Q
quasars matched with the Gaia DR3 database.
The blue
lines represent statistics for objects without a magnitude cut,
while the orange lines correspond to objects with G < 20.5,
where Gaia’s detection completeness is high. The Poisson
errors are displayed for each line. Top: The significance of
proper motion (PMSIG) for matched DR16Q quasars as a
function of redshift. The fraction of matched quasars with
high proper motion significance (PMSIG > 3) rises rapidly
at redshifts below 0.5, suggesting increased stellar contam-
ination. Bottom: The astrometric excess noise (AEN) for
matched DR16Q quasars as a function of redshift. Similarly,
the fraction of matched quasars with high astrometric excess
noise (AEN > 5 mas) increases markedly at redshifts be-
low 0.5, indicating potential contributions from host galaxy
emission.
Figure 5 displays additional statistical properties of
the parent pair sample with z > 0.5 and G < 20.5.
The left panel shows the magnitude distribution of the
primary DR16Q mathched quasars in the pair for refer-
ence, while the right panel shows the magnitude con-
trast (G2 −G1) between the primary quasar and its
companion at different separations.
Starlike compan-
ions can be significantly brighter at large separations,
which contrasts markedly with quasar-like companions.
The differences in the distributions of color, separation,
and magnitude contrast between quasar-like and star-
like companions all indicate that the proper motion clas-
sification is relatively effective in distinguishing double
quasars from quasar+star pairs.
2.2.2. PCA Analysis and Literature Search
The residual stellar contamination in our pair classi-
fication may be particularly bad at separations ≲1′′,
where Gaia may struggle to resolve the proper motion
measurements of such close neighbors, as the overlap-
ping sources may significantly affect proper motion mea-
surements by Gaia. To estimate the residual stellar con-
tamination in quasar-like companions, we follow Shen
et al. (2023a) and apply a spectral principal component
analysis (PCA) technique to decompose the SDSS spec-
trum. For completeness, this method is applied to 307
pairs with separations of < 1.′′5 from the initial cata-
log of all 2,497 pairs. Pairs within 1.′′5 separations are
close enough for the SDSS fiber spectroscopy, with a di-
ameter of 2′′ or 3′′, to capture most of the light from
both components. Thus, PCA may decompose poten-
tial quasar+star superpositions using quasar and stellar
PCA templates available from the SDSS website. Af-
ter running PCA on these pairs, we visually inspect all
PCA-decomposed spectra and flag obvious quasar+star
superpositions.
This step is necessary because auto-
matic classifications from PCA decomposition are of-
ten unreliable due to degeneracies in the decomposition
and noise in the spectra of these close pairs. The PCA
classification results are presented in the “PCA TYPE”
column of Table 2.
For the parent pair sample with z > 0.5 and G < 20.5,
155 out of 1,120 pairs have separations of < 1.′′5. Among
these 155 pairs, 77 pairs have quasar-like companions
based on the Gaia PM criterion. And among these 77
pairs, the PCA results identified 26 pairs that are ap-
parent star superpositions, implying a residual stellar
contamination rate of 34% (26/77) in pairs with sep-
arations of < 1.′′5. This contamination rate is consis-
tent with that estimated in Shen et al. (2023a) for the
high-redshift subset. We also visually inspect the PCA
decomposition for starlike companions (based on PM-
SIG) in pairs with separations of < 1.′′5, and most of
them show composite spectra similar to stars or galax-
ies, further supporting the effectiveness of the Gaia
PMSIG classification. To mitigate star contamination
in the < 1.′′5 regime, we exclude these PCA-identified
quasar+star pairs from the double quasar sample, re-
sulting in 136 pairs with quasar-like companions and
therefore 984 starlike companions in the “refined pair
sample”, as summarized in Table 1. However, we can-
not fully eliminate stellar contamination in pairs with
separations of > 1.′′5, and we defer a rough estimation
to Section 2.3 to assess the overall purity of the refined
pair sample at these large separations.
The PCA results for low-redshift or faint quasar or
quasar-star pairs that do not meet our statistical cuts
are also visually inspected. This includes 152 pairs with
(z ≤0.5 or G ≥20.5) and separations of < 1.′′5. The
PCA results show that approximately 29% of quasar
