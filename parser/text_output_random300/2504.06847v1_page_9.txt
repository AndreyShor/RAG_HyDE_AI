size in the 25-150 m range). Lastly, the optical damage threshold experiments were performed 
with 800 and 1000 nm laser pulses. 
The standard Maker fringe method [46] was used for the determination of the individual 
components of the second order nonlinear optical tensor [𝑑𝑖𝑗𝑘
𝑆𝐻𝐺] (contracted Voigt notation for 
tensor components dmn is used in the following text) of 2-AmpH2PO3 single crystal samples. 
SHG measurements with plane parallel samples were performed using a Q-switched Nd-YAG 
laser (1064 nm).  
Experimental details concerning all performed SHG measurements are available in 
Supplementary material. The details of the measurement strategy used for monoclinic crystals 
of point group 2 have been described, for example, in Ref. [47].  
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Crystal structures  
Selected bond lengths and angles, including those of hydrogen bonds, are for 2-AmpH2PO3, 
2-AmpHSO4 (I), 2-AmpHSO4 (II) and (2-Amp)2SO4H2O presented in Tables S6-S9, 
Supplementary material. Atom numbering is shown in Figs. S2-S5, Supplementary material. 
The crystals of 2-AmpH2PO3 belong to the monoclinic system with the space group P21. 
The crystal structure is based on chains of hydrogen-bonded (O-H…O) hydrogen phosphite 
anions, oriented along the c-axis (graph-set motif

which are interconnected by 2-aminopyrimidium(1+) cations via N-H…O and C-H…O

and C2-H2…O1d hydrogen bonds with donor-acceptor distances 2.827(3) and 3.326(3) Å, 
respectively. The crystal structure of 2-AmpH2PO3 does not contain any - stacking 
interaction within the generally used definition (see, e.g., refs. [48, 49]).  
Comparing the results of the crystal structure determination of 2-AmpH2PO3 at 273 K [23] 
and the presented measurement at 150 K, the volume of the unit cell follows expected trends 
and decreases with temperature – i.e. 373.97(6) Å3 and 367.25(3) Å3 for 273 K and 150 K, 
respectively. Surprisingly, the lattice parameter c is slightly longer at 150 K (4.7606(2) Å) 
compared to the results at 273 K (4.7517(4) Å). This finding reflects that the length of this
