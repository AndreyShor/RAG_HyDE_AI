Double Quasar Fraction [per

Figure 8. Measured double quasar fraction corrected for
pair incompleteness (Section 2.4) at different redshift bins
and G < 20.5. The estimated lensed quasar fraction from
Shen et al. (2023a) is not applied here to exclude potential
lensed quasars. The black circles shows the fraction at z >
0.5.
And the blue and red circles present the fraction at
lower redshift bin 0.5 < z ≤1.5 and higher redshift bin
z > 1.5, respectively.
The bootstrap errors are provided
for the sample in each redshift range.
No double quasars
are found in the 0.′′3 < ∆θ < 0.′′5 bin for the lower-redshift
group, so the fraction is zero and not shown.
simulations and observations suggest that many lumi-
nous dual AGNs are obscured (at least for one member)
in gas-rich mergers (e.g., Chen et al. 2023a; Li et al.
2024), which are not included in the observation work
mentioned above leading to a higher dual AGN fraction
than the observed fraction of unobscured dual quasars.
Finally, although the quasar luminosities are matched
between simulations and observations, there may still be
deviations on the overall AGN luminosity function, and
some simulations still suffer from small number statistics
for the most luminous quasar population (see detailed
discussion in Puerto-S´anchez et al. 2025).
Despite these differences, we conclude that the ob-
served double quasar statistics are broadly consistent
with other observations and simulation-based predic-
tions for the dual quasar population. However, precisely
assessing the consistency between simulations and ob-
servations requires future deep and wide AGN surveys.
A recent work using the low-to-moderate luminosity X-
ray AGN sample in the COSMOS field (Li et al. 2024)
showed a promising agreement between simulated and
observed dual AGN fractions to fainter luminosities than
probed here.
But the statistics of dual AGNs in the
COSMOS sample are still limited, especially at z > 3.

Note—Pair statistics are measured for double quasars
with Z > 0.5 and G < 20.5, identified through
proper motion and PCA inspection, in ∆θ bins of
0.′′2 linear size. Columns (1) lists the median sepa-
ration in the unit of arcsec for each bin. Columns (2)
shows the number of raw pair counts NQQ. Columns
(3)–(5) are the pair statistics corrected for complete-
ness (NQQ,corr), with the uncertainties (σ−and σ+)
estimated from bootstrap resampling. Column (6)
lists the uncertainties in NQQ,corr estimated from
Poisson counting uncertainties from the raw pair
counts NQQ.
In this work we performed a systematic search for
galactic-scale quasar pairs combining the spectroscopic
SDSS DR16 quasar catalog with data from Gaia DR3.
There are 2, 497 unique Gaia pairs around SDSS quasars
within a 3′′ matching radius (∼3 −30 kpc at z = 1.7).
To distinguish between true double quasars and con-
taminating foreground star superpositions, we apply
a proper motion criterion (PMSIG < 3), classifying
companions as either quasar-like or starlike. Addition-
ally, we perform a spectral PCA analysis for small-scale
(< 1.′′5) pairs using SDSS spectra and conduct a liter-
ature search to further eliminate stellar contaminants.
Restricting to redshift and magnitude ranges of z > 0.5
and G < 20.5 to balance sample statistics and purity,
our final statistical sample consists of 136 double quasars
and 984 quasar-star pairs. This study extends our earlier
work (Shen et al. 2023a) to fainter quasar luminosities
