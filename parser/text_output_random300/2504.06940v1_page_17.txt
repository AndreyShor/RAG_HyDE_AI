Continue on from Theorem III.5, we can then give a bound in terms of distance between quantum states.
Theorem III.7 (State Distance Bound for Grover Gate). Consider a univariate random variable X with
• |E [X]| ⩽ε;
• E

Proof. Theorem III.5 tells us that G has eigenvalue eiα with eigenket |α⟩, where α ∈(−π, π], such that
• |α −E [X]| ⩽3.1588s2

Consider the projection of |1⟩onto |α⟩, ⟨α|1⟩|α⟩. By triangle inequality we know that
GN |1⟩−eiNE[X] |1⟩= |∆1⟩+ |∆2⟩+ |∆3⟩
(83)
where

|∆1⟩= GN |1⟩−GN ⟨α|1⟩|α⟩= GN |1⟩−eiNα ⟨α|1⟩|α⟩
|∆2⟩= eiNα ⟨α|1⟩|α⟩−eiNE[X] ⟨α|1⟩|α⟩
|∆3⟩= eiNE[X] ⟨α|1⟩|α⟩−eiNE[X] |1⟩
(84)
Or, to simplify a bit:

|∆1⟩= GN (|1⟩−⟨α|1⟩|α⟩)
|∆2⟩=

⟨α|1⟩|α⟩
|∆3⟩= eiNE[X] (⟨α|1⟩|α⟩−|1⟩)
(85)
It is thus easy to see that |∆1⟩⊥|∆2⟩and |∆3⟩⊥|∆2⟩. Combined we can use triangular inequality to bound:

Eq. (86) is exactly our conclusion.
Theorem III.7 and Remark III.7 presented a primitive that serves the same purpose as the “Directional Mean
Oracle” in Ref. [5], except there are no truncations and the fact that the deviation from eiNE[X] cannot be made
arbitarily small. This would eventually results in a different multivariate mean value estimator in Sec. IV A.
