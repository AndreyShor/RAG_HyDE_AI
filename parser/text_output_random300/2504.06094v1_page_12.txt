Recall that A(X) is a bimodule over A(1D). We get a left A(1D)-valued inner product on
A(X) by
A(1D)(f1, f2) = f1f ∗
2 ,
and the right A(1D)-valued inner product by
⟨f1|f2⟩A(1D) = (R∗⊗idA)(idX ⊗f ∗
1 f2)(R ⊗idA).
In general, these inner products are not full, and their ranges are ideals of A(1D).
Let pX be the central projection of A(1D) such that pA(1D) agrees with the range of left
A(1D)-valued inner product on A(X).
Proposition 4.17. We have r-Ind(A(X)) ≥d(X)−1pX for X ∈D.
Proof. According to [KPW04, Proposition 2.27], we have r-Ind(A(X)) ≥λ′pX for positive scalar
λ′ whenever λ′ ⟨f|f⟩A(1D)
 ≤
A(1D)(f, f)
 holds for all f ∈A(X). Thus, it is enough to check
that λ′ = d(X)−1 satisﬁes this inequality.
By ∥R∥= d(X)1/2, we have
d(X)−1 ⟨f|f⟩A(1D)
 ≤d(X)−1 ∥R∥2 f ∗f
 =
f ∗f
 .
By the C∗-identity, the elements ff ∗∈A(1D) and f ∗f ∈EndB0-A(X ⊗A) have the same norm.
This proves the claim.

Now, following [KPW04], we deﬁne r-Ind(B0AB0) to be the right index element r-Ind(B0YB0),
where Y is the direct sum of the Hilbert B0 ⊗A(1D)-bimodules X ⊗A(X) for X ∈Irr(D).
Theorem 4.18. Let supp(A) denote the subset of Irr D formed by the irreducible objects X
such that A(X) ̸= 0, and let σ(Z(A(1D))) be the set of minimal central projections of A(1D).
Then there is a partition of supp(A) into subsets Sp labeled by p ∈σ(Z(A(1D))), such that
r-Ind(B0AB0) ≥
X
p∈σ(Z(A(1D)))

holds.
Proof. We have r-Ind(A) = P
X∈supp(A) r-Ind(X ⊗A(X)) and r-Ind(X ⊗A(X)) = r-Ind(X) ⊗
r-Ind(A(X)). Then the claim follows from Lemma 4.16 and Proposition 4.17, by picking p′
X ∈
σ(Z(A(1D))) satisfying p′
X ≤pX for each X ∈supp(A).

If D ⊂C is an inclusion of C∗-algebras with a conditional expectation E : C →D of ﬁnite
index λ, C becomes a bi-Hilbertian C-D-module and ∥r-Ind(C)∥= λ′−1 holds for a (possibly
diﬀerent) constant λ′ > 0 such that E −λ′idC is completely positive [KPW04, Proposition 2.12
and remark after Deﬁnition 2.17]. Note also that if E is of ﬁnite index, then C becomes a
bi-Hilbertian D-bimodule such that r-Ind(DCD) = r-Ind(CCD).
Corollary 4.19. The conditional expectation E: A →B0 ⊗(B′
0 ∩A) is of ﬁnite index if and
only if both C−and C+ are unitary fusion categories.
Proof. By the above estimate, E is of ﬁnite index if and only if supp(A) is a ﬁnite set. Recall
that the irreducible objects of D = C−⊠C+ can be parameterized as
Irr(D) = { Y ⊠Y ′ | Y ∈Irr(C−), Y ′ ∈Irr(C+) } .
Given Y ∈Irr(C−), let us take a DHR bimodule XY such that Y appears as a direct summand
of XY
−. By Section A, we have XY ∈DHR(A•) as well. Then XY
−⊗XY
+ maps to A by the
B0-bimodule map
ξ ⊗η 7→⟨η|ξ⟩.
Moreover, if ξ is nonzero, then we can ﬁnd η such that this pairing is nonzero. Indeed, by
choosing a basis (ηi)i localized in a positive interval, the equality ξ = P
i ηi ⟨ηi|ξ⟩implies that
