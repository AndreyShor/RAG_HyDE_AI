providing in addition the breakdown of the partonic channels, which is particularly useful in
order to get a handle on the strange-quark parton-distribution functions. For the same process,
Ref. [752] provided theoretical predictions at NLOQCD accuracy matched to parton shower with
massive charm quarks.
Particle-level results were presented while comparing several parton
showers. In addition, hadronisation and underlying-event effects were investigated.
In Ref. [149], NNLOQCD predictions have been presented for Z + c production in the
fiducial region of the LHCb measurement. It is important to notice that the authors refrain from
comparing their predictions to the LHCb measurement [753] due to the difficulty of comparing
theoretical predictions and experimental measurements involving flavour jets on an equal footing,
as well as the large effects due to multiple-particle interactions observed in this set-up.
In Ref. [154], NLOQCD predictions have been provided for Z production in association
with light charged hadrons inside a jet or the production of a W along with a charm hadron.
Results are shown for several fragmentation functions and are compared to LHCb and ATLAS
measurements at 13TeV.
NNLOQCD corrections matched to parton shower for the production of a Z boson in asso-
ciation with a bottom-quark pair are presented in Ref. [754]. Assuming a four-flavour scheme,
the authors find that the NNLOQCD corrections resolve previously-observed tensions between
lower-order predictions in four- and five-flavour schemes. These state-of-the-art predictions are
compared to a CMS measurement [755], showing good agreement.
In Ref. [756], a mass variable-flavor number scheme has been designed for Z+heavy quark.
The authors illustrated their work by looking at Z + b production at the LHC.
Advances have also been seen for the calculation of mixed QCD-EW corrections for Z+jet
production. In particular, in Ref. [757], the bosonic contribution to the two-loop mixed QCD-
electroweak scattering amplitudes has been obtained. The amplitudes have been evaluated on
a two-dimensional grid in the rapidity and transverse momentum of the Z boson.
Pushing theoretical accuracy even further, there has been impressive progress towards
N3LOQCD accuracy for V+jet production. For example, the planar three-loop QCD helicity
amplitudes for V+jet production have been obtained [758].
Along the same line, two-loop
helicity amplitudes including axial-vector couplings [759] to higher orders in ϵ [760] have been
obtained.
Finally, N3LL resummation of one-jettiness for Z + j production has been presented in
Ref. [761]. The calculation has been matched to the corresponding fixed-order predictions, hence
making these predictions also applicable to phase-space regions with extra hard jets.

V + ≥2j
LH21 status: NLOQCD computations known for V + 2j final states in QCD [762, 763] and
EW [764] production modes, for V + 3j [765–770], for V + 4j [771,772] and for W + 5j [773];
NLOEW corrections known [774, 775], including merging and showering [776, 777]; Multi-jet
merged prediction up to 9 jets at LO [778].
The NNLOQCD calculation of the production of an isolated photon in association with a
jet pair has been presented [182]. The authors perform a comparison with ATLAS data [779]
and find that the agreement with their new calculation is better than the one with parton-
shower-matched and multi-jet-merged predictions generated for the ATLAS analysis using the
SHERPA Monte Carlo. It is worth noting that this was the first 2 →3 calculation at NNLOQCD
accuracy not reverting to the leading-colour approximation. Nonetheless, the effect of full colour
in the two-loop virtual part has been found to be small with respect to the remaining theoretical
uncertainties.
