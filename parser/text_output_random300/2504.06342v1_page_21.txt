term evolution of large-scale feedback dynamics
simultaneously.
As the initial application of this framework, we
simulate an isolated elliptical galaxy under three
configurations:
the fiducial model with both
SN and AGN feedback active, and two variants
- noSNfb and noAGNfb - with either AGN or SN
feedback disabled, respectively. These simulations
exhibit distinct characteristics in AGN luminosity,
star formation rate, AGN duty cycle, BH growth,
star formation, metal enrichment, and X-ray prop-
erties. The distinct behaviors of these models pro-
vide valuable insights into the complex interplay
between AGN and SN feedback mechanisms in reg-
ulating galaxy evolution, in particular, emphasizing
the importance of SN feedback which is often un-
derappreciated in elliptical environments.
The principal findings are:
(i) Positive temporal correlation between AGN
luminosity and sSFR The AGN luminos-
ity and specific star formation rate in the
fiducial model demonstrate strong tem-
poral correlation despite fluctuating across
multiple orders of magnitude.
Episodes
of high-accretion cold mode AGN feedback
(ùêøbh/ùêøEdd > 2%) coincide with elevated
sSFR (‚àº10‚àí12 yr‚àí1), while hot mode feed-
back maintains low sSFR (‚â≤10‚àí13 yr‚àí1).
This correlation indicates shared dependence
on the available gas reservoir, while the
galaxy maintains an overall quiescent state.
(ii) Gas properties:
instantaneous impact on
small scales Gas near the Bondi radius (ùëü‚àº
1 kpc) exhibits complex structures and dy-
namics that closely track instantaneous AGN
luminosity.
High-density cool gas inflows
and high-velocity (‚àº104 kpc) cold winds
manifest during high accretion periods, while
clumpy or spiral-structured cool filaments
with turbulent motions characterize low ac-
cretion states. At intermediate scales (ùëü‚àº
5 kpc), bi-conical structures triggered by past
cold-mode AGN feedback are visible.
(iii) Gas properties: delayed response on large
scales Gas properties at halo scales (ùëü‚â≥
100 kpc) reflect delayed AGN feedback ef-
fects rather than instantaneous luminosity.
High-temperature shells with strong den-
sity and temperature gradients indicate past
AGN-driven outflows, though no direct cor-
relation exists between instantaneous AGN
luminosity and halo-scale properties.
(iv) Distinct duty cycles: SN feedback crucial
for gas accretion regulation The AGN duty
cycles vary qualitatively across simulations.
The fiducial model exhibits observation-
ally consistent duty cycles of several percent
with a single-cycle timescale of ‚àº102 Myr.
Without SN feedback, the noSNfb model
shows sub-percent duty cycles and a single-
cycle timescale of ‚àºMyr, highlighting SN
feedback‚Äôs crucial role in regulating gas ac-
cretion and thus AGN activity. The noAGNfb
model maintains consistently high AGN lu-
minosity without clear cycling.
(v) Feedback effects on BH growth and star for-
mation: negative but complex AGN feed-
back effectively constrains BH growth, lim-
iting mass increase to a few percent com-
pared to nearly 200% growth without feed-
back.
Star formation remains suppressed
across all models, with newly-formed stel-
lar mass reaching only ‚àº107 M‚äô. Notably,
the fiducial model exhibits several-fold
higher star formation efficiency than single-
feedback models, suggesting potentially pos-
itive SN feedback effects through turbulence-
enhanced gas mixing and cooling. Lower star
formation in noAGNfb is due to the central
SMBH accreting gas at a high rate, reducing
the gas available for star formation, rather
than the AGN feedback itself is positive for
star formation.

bined
feedback
