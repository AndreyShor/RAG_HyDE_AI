Figure 5 presents a series of zoomed-in absorption spectra for the Si-based meta-grating under 
TM and TE polarizations, illustrating sharp resonances that shift significantly as the bulk refractive 
index changes from 1.3 to 1.5. Each subpanel highlights one or more narrow Mie-type resonances 
and their red-shift across the index increase. The TM mode spectra are shown in the left panel, or 
Figs. 5(a), (c), (e), and (g), while TE mode results are given in the right panel, or Figs. 5(b), (d), 
(f), and (h). The selected peaks exhibit high spectral sensitivity and sharpness, with shifts that span 
tens of nanometers or more for a 0.1 variation in the bulk index. This results in nm/RIU in the 
order of tens. These shifts often vary in slope and symmetry depending on the peakâ€™s location and 
the surrounding spectral context. 
These peak shifts, which occur consistently across a range of wavelengths, form the foundation 
of traditional biosensing approaches that rely on tracking the movement of a single resonance. 
Figure 6 further quantifies this behavior by plotting the wavelength shifts of selected resonances 
in the Si-based meta-grating as a function of bulk refractive index, revealing strong linearity for 
individual peaks. The TM polarization results are displayed in Figure 6(a), and TE results are 
shown in Figure 6(b). For both polarizations, the tracked peaks exhibit consistent redshifts as the 
refractive index increases from 1.30 to 1.40, confirming their suitability for refractive index 
sensing based on spectral displacement. The shift trends appear approximately linear over the 
simulated range for most peaks, although the magnitude of sensitivity varies substantially across 
resonance locations. Notably, the 8209 nm peak in the TM configuration shows both the largest 
and most linear shift, which, as will be discussed later, results in the lowest mean squared error 
among all single-predictor models in our regression analysis. This observation reinforces the 
strong link between linearity of spectral displacement and predictive performance in linear 
modeling frameworks. 
When the peak tracing behavior is similar to the one shown in Fig. 6, the 1-dimensional linear 
fitting for a selected peak is the traditional approach for the estimation of the unknown bulk index. 
In our previous work, we demonstrated that this linear response enables effective modeling through 
linear or ridge regression when multiple peak shifts are used as inputs, resulting in substantial 
accuracy improvements over single-feature methods. However, while these isolated peaks behave 
linearly with respect to index, the full spectrum, comprising many sharp, nonlinear resonances, 
does not. This fundamental mismatch between spectral shape and linear model assumptions limits
