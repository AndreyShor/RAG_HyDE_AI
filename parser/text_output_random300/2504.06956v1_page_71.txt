Proof of Proposition 6.1

for some constant a > 0. By arguing as in the proof of Lemma 4.20, and using the fact that the
function Fλ
b,x−L,L is bounded above by L, we note that for any x ∈[L/2, A + L], b ≥0 sufficiently
large, and u ∈[b1/4, b3/4], it holds that

Obviously, the same bound also holds with Fλ
b,x−L,L(Υu+x

) replaced by Fλ
k,x−L,L(Υu+x
b
). Therefore,
we can focus our attention on the complement of the event Ek,b. Specifically, we need to estimate the
following expectation

(7.41)
By recalling the Definition 4.6 of the control variable Kb, we can further restrict our attention
to the event {Kb ≤k}, as the bound on the complement of this event can be obtained by using
Lemma 4.10. We recall that Υu+x
b
(0) = 0, and so on the complement of the event Ek,b, it holds that
|Dλ
b,0(Υu+x
b

k,0(Υu+x

)|. Therefore, we have that

Thanks to Lemma 4.9, and by choosing a > 0 sufficiently large, we observe that there exists a constant

Therefore, recalling once again the Definition 4.6 of the control variable Kb, on the event Ec
k,b ∩{Kb ≤
k}, by using the decomposition (4.5) of the field Υb and by choosing the constant a > 0 sufficiently
large, we obtain that there exist constants c2, c3 > 0 such that

where we recall that dj is defined as in (7.13), and we use the notation introduced in (6.1). Furthermore,
since thanks to (K2), the function K is supported in B(0, 1), we observe that on B1 \ B0, the measure
µγ,j has the same law as the measure introduced in (1.9) (with t replaced by j), i.e., it is a regularised
and normalised supercritical GMC measure. Hence, applying the previous estimate, we deduce that
the quantity in (7.41) is bounded above by

We observe that the quantity inside the parenthesis in the previous display is independent of (Bs)s≤b.
Therefore, using (4.13) and arguing as in the proof of Lemma 4.10, for any k ≥0 sufficiently large and
for b ≥0 sufficiently large, the quantity in the previous display is bounded from above by a multiple of
