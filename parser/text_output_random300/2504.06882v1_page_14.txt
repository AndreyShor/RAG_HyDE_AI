First amphicosm M1
The momentum space Bieberbach group corresponding to the Brillouin first amphicosm is Pc. In this context, we
adopt the convention that the point group D1 = {E, Gx} of Pc acts on momentum space as follows:
Gx : (kx, ky, kz) →(−kx, ky, kz + 1
2Gz).
(S55)
The reduced K group eK(M0) ∼= Z ⊕Z2 reflects the presence of a Chern number and a Z2-invariant. These invariants
can be expressed as:
Ch = 1
2π
Z
M
f,
ν(2) = 1
2π
Z
X
f −2
π
Z
S+ a
mod 2.
(S56)
Here, the 2D sub-manifolds M, X, and the oriented segment S+ are illustrated in Fig. S4(a).
On the planes kx = 0 or kx = π, the glide reflection Gx acts as a half-translation along the kz-direction. Therefore,
the sub-manifold X is a 2D torus, and a Chern number can be defined over it. The Chern number for the plane
defined by ky-kz at an arbitrary kx is 2Ch. Moreover, due to the glide reflection symmetry Gx, the sub-manifold X
has the topology of a 2D Klein bottle. The Z2-invariant ν(2) is defined over X as described in the main text.
Furthermore, it is straightforward to verify that the Chern numbers vanish in the other two directions. Specifically,
on the kx-ky and kx-kz planes, the kx-coordinate is reversed by the glide reflection Gx.
Second amphicosm M2
The momentum space Bieberbach group corresponding to the second amphicosm is Cc. We assume that the point
group D1 = {E, G} acts on momentum space as follows:
G : (kx, ky, kz) →(ky, kx, kz + 1
2Gz).
(S57)
The reduced K group eK(M2) is isomorphic to Z, and the only topological invariant is the Chern number, which is
given by:
Ch = 1
2π
Z
M
f,
(S58)
where M is shown in Fig. S4(b).
Similar to the case of Pc, the Chern number can be defined on half of the plane ky = kx. Furthermore, the Chern
number on the kx-ky plane vanishes. While it appears that we could define a Z2-invariant on X, since X is also with
2D Klein bottle topology under the action G, we can prove that the value of this invariant is dependent on the Chern
number Ch. The detailed proof will be presented in the next section.
First amphidicosm M3
The momentum space Bieberbach group corresponding to the first amphidicosm is Pca21. We assume the action
of the point group D2 = {E, Gx, Gy, GxGy} on momentum space is given by:
Gx : (kx, ky, kz) →(−kx, ky, kz + 1
2Gz),
Gy : (kx, ky, kz) →(kx + 1
2Gx, −ky, kz).
(S59)
The reduced K group eK(M3) is isomorphic to Z2
2. The two Z2-invariants can be defined as:
ν(2)
