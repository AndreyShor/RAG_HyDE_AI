We can identify F as,
F = {[eimj],
i = 0,1
j = 0,1,2,3}.
(A.5)
In general the simple anyons of Z will not remain simple in F. We can express a
anyon in Z as superposition of anyons in F. Using the ‘inverse’/lift map,
[ei′mj′] Ð→⊕
i′,j′ ni′j′
ij eimj
(A.6)
where,
ni′j′
ij = {1
if
j = j′
mod 4,i = i′
mod 2,
0
otherwise,
replacing ni′j′
ij , we have the lift
[eimj] Ð→eimj + ei+2mj
(A.7)
with the topological spins deﬁned as,
θ(ejmk) = (i)jk.
The anyons where every term in the lift has the same spin survive as bulk excitation
after condensation, which enforces,
θ(eimj) = θ(ei+2mj),
(A.8)
so j has to be even, as a result we can identify the reduced topological order to
be,
Z′ = {[eimj]
i = 0,1
j = 0,2}.
(A.9)
Now, moving on to the Ae2m2 = 1 ⊕e2m2 condensable algebra, our (A.3) gets
modiﬁed,
HomF([eimj],[ekml]) = HomZ(eimj,ekml ⊗Ae2m2),
= HomZ(eimj,ekml) ⊕HomZ(eimj,ek+2ml+2).
(A.10)
Once again we identify,
HomF([eimj],[ekml]) = {C
(i = k,
j = l
mod 2
and i + j = k + l
mod 4),
0
otherwise,
(A.11)
following the same proceedure,
[eimj] Ð→eimj ⊕ei+2mj+2.
(A.12)
The condition from topological spins enforces, i+j = even, that allows us to identify,
Z′ = {[1],[em],[e2],[e3m]}.
(A.13)
This is the double semion model with e2 being the bosonic s¯s.
