and elaborate on its non-factorizing IR behavior in our framework as described in the main text.
This defect already exposes a problem at the level of the matrix elements for ˆO (B.1). In fact, the following integral
⟨ϕ2(x)| ˆO|ϕ(y)⟩= 2

suffers from IR divergence. This divergence is related to the presence of vacuum moduli in the free scalar field (which fix the
boundary condition at infinity). One could resolve this issue by performing an appropriate subtraction of these contributions, but
doing so would render the operator ˆO non-self-adjoint.
A possible way to circumvent this problem is to study the defect on the cylinder Rτ × Sd−1, where we define
ˆO =
Z
dSd−1ϕ(⃗x, τ = 0) .
For explicitness let us focus on 3d (the extension to general d is straightforward). By canonical quantization,

(E.6)
Since the measure of λ is flat, we have that the weak limit of |λ⟩is zero,
w-lim
λ→∞|λ⟩= 0 ,
(E.7)
which produces an ill-defined non-conformal limit (correlation functions with ϕ(x) diverge as xd →∞) and the lack of IR
factorization. Let us stress that, in comparison to the general discussion in (II.10), for this particular case, any choice of |e⟩∈H
would never give us the flat measure (due to the flat moduli preserved by the defect). Consequently, we have to enlarge the range
of integration in the spectral decomposition from finite range to infinite, which produces the above exotic behavior.
Appendix F: The ill-defined defect “one-point” functions
A careful reader might note that, from the definition of Ishibashi (and defect) state via the weak limit (see around (II.5)), some
correlation functions are ill-defined in the presence of a defect, even for normalizable states. This is not surprising, since we
know that Ishibashi states are non-normalizable, and by the Riesz representation theorem [58] we must conclude that correlation
functions involving Ishibashi states cannot be defined for all states in the Hilbert space H. Here we give a simple example in the
N-S quantization [53] since this is our choice of frame in the main text. We will also illustrate the same phenomena in the more
familiar radial quantization.
Let us consider a scalar primary operator ϕ with scaling dimension ∆, which satisfies the following two-point function and
Ishibashi state condition
⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(y)⟩=
