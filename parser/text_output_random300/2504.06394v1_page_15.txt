Figure 5: The influence of dimensionless stiffness 𝜅on the cupular deformation. (a) As 𝜅
is increased, the deformation (normalized by the maximum) transitions from following the
angular velocity to following the angular acceleration. (b) This transition with 𝜅may be
shown by plotting the correlation, 𝑅, between the deformation and the angular velocity
Ω(𝑡) (solid curve) or the angular acceleration ¤Ω(𝑡) (dashed curve). A transition between
the two regimes occurs around 𝜅≈100. In both plots, colour is used to show the value of 𝜅.
As expected from our asymptotic analysis, Δ𝑝correlates with the angular velocity for small
to moderate values of 𝜅, and the angular acceleration for large values of 𝜅. For the parameters
used in Figure 5, we compute 𝜅𝑐= 32𝜋≈100, in agreement with the transition point
observed in the plot.
4. Numerical simulations
To test the validity of our asymptotic approach, we return to the numerical simulations in
COMSOL as presented in §2.2 but now imposing within the numerical scheme the forcing
given by (3.19), and varying the Young’s modulus of the solid material to change 𝜅. We
perform two direct comparisons, appearing in Figures 6 and 7. Figure 6 plots the cupular
pressure jump Δ𝑝as a function of time, while Figure 7 plots the axial velocity profiles across
the cross section, sampled at several time points for different values of 𝜅in a region of the
canal far from the cupula. In both figures, we observe excellent agreement between theory
and numerics. In particular, the breaking of symmetry in the flow profile for large 𝜅is easily
observed in Figure 7, and the theoretical profile captures the trend and profile shape very
well.
The numerical simulations were performed for 𝑎= 1.6 × 10−4 m, 𝑅= 3.2 × 10−3 m and
T = 1 sec. As 𝜅was varied the Young’s modulus of the cupula 𝐸was appropriately chosen to
match the desired relative stiffness. The fluid is taken to be water (𝜇≈10−3 Kg·m−1·sec−1,
and 𝜌= 1000 Kg·m−3). We consider a uniform semicircular canal with 𝑎(𝑠) = 1.
We remark that although the symmetry breaking might suggest a breakdown of the
asymptotic order, with the second term dominating the first in the series, subsequent terms
are well behaved and the series is not divergent. This may be inferred from the agreement
between the model solution and the numerical solution to the full nonlinear problem, even
for large 𝜅values where the symmetry is broken. Moreover, as the symmetry breaking
occurs because the leading order term shrinks and the correction retains its size (rather than
growing), we expect higher order terms to retain their sizes too, preserving the asymptotic
order of the solution.
We have thus far considered slow movements, so that T > 1 s and St ≪1. However, for
faster movements, typically when T < 1 s, the Stokes number is no longer negligible and
