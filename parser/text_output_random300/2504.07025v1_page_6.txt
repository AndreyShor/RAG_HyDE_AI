Table 1. Quantitative assessment of rendering and reconstruction quality. To ensure a fair comparison in the 3D reconstruction quality,
all models are normalized to the unit sphere. Note that, we do not directly compare with NeuralPIL and Ref-NeuS, as they fail to produce
valid geometry in several cases, as evident in Fig. 4. Nevertheless, with the incorporation of polarization cues, our method consistently
achieves the best results.

These methods typically rely on RGB data, which can
struggle with accurate geometry reconstruction and radi-
ance decomposition due to the limitations of using only in-
tensity measurements. This often results in artifacts and
inconsistencies, particularly in areas with strong specular
reflections. We propose that incorporating polarization in-
formation is essential as it connects surface normals with
lighting and material properties, improving the accuracy of
these processes. Our evaluations, using open-source code
from the original authors, indicate that our approach still
delivers superior quality as shown in Tab. 1.
However,
due to the inherent limitations in various methods, such
as, PhySG’s overly smooth geometry and inaccurate ra-
diance decomposition, InvRender’s superior performance
only in synthetic scenarios, Ref-NeuS’s effectiveness in
view-dependent weighting scheme, and NeRO’s proficiency
in handling strong reflective objects, conventional objects in
real-world settings often exhibit sub-optimal performance.
In Tab. 1, we further conduct a thorough evaluation con-
cerning the quantitative accuracy on the aforementioned test
set. Firstly, we assess the rendering quality of our method
and compare it to state-of-the-art algorithms. Hereby, we
report the average PSNR and SSIM in comparison to the
ground-truth test images.
Next, we employ an invasive
method to reconstruct the ground-truth shapes for these
highly specular objects, so as to facilitate numerical as-
sessment on the geometry recovery. Specifically, we ap-
ply a diffuse developer to objects and scan them using a
high-end industrial-level 3D scanner. However, due to the
potential inconsistency between the scanning and recon-
struction coordinate systems, we manually scale and trans-
late the scanned model to align with the reconstruction co-
ordinate system.
Subsequently, we utilize the non-rigid
ICP algorithm to achieve the complete alignment between
the scanned model and the reconstructed model under the
shared coordinate system. Once aligned, the sum of the
bi-directional chamfer distance (CD) between the recon-
structed and scanned models is computed.

though PANDORA outputs sharp results, our method is also able
to produce comparable results, because overall we use fewer con-
straints and need to solve for more unknowns.

iffRec encounters challenges in effectively disentangling
the diffuse and specular components and yields fundamen-
tally erroneous geometric estimations. Surprisingly, this de-
ficiency appears to exert minimal influence on the ultimate
rendering quality, as evidenced by the high PSNR and SSIM
metrics. We hypothesize that this arises from the method’s
inability to effectively resolve the inherent ambiguity be-
tween these two components, yet it still manages to yield
exceptional rendering results grounded primarily in RGB
loss. Conversely, NeRO exhibits improved geometric re-
construction capabilities, but its performance in radiance
decomposition is lackluster. This arises from its rigid de-
sign tailored for entirely specular objects.
