the forward and backward Rxx traces are almost identical, as shown in Figure.
1e (top
panel) with no signature of hysteresis behavior in resistance with B||. From the definition
of rMR defined earlier, we then get ∆Rxx ≈0 (Figure. 1e (bottom panel)). But near the
underdoping (ν < νop) and the overdoping (ν > νop) region, we observe a hysteresis between
the measured Rxx for the two different sweep directions of B|| resembling the shape of the
wings of a ‘butterfly’ as shown in Figure 1d,f (top panel). Curiously, the sharp peaks on both
sides of the B|| = 0 appears at |B||| ∼17 −19 mT. As demonstrated in Figure. 1d,f (bottom
panel), depending on the structure of the Butterfly Magnetoresistance (BMR)27–30 hysteresis
curves (SI- 2) in Figure. 1d,f (top panel), we get a positive (negative) value of ∆Rxx for
a negative (positive) B|| following equation (1). These observations of hysteresis behavior
in the magnetoresistance around the superconducting region can be seen more easily from
the ∆Rxx(ν, B||) 2−d colormap in Figure. 2a for D = 0.00 V/nm. At zero D, we see two
separate hysteresis ‘islands’ around ν ∼2.2 and ν ∼3 flanking either side of the SC region
of the near magic-angle TBG.
Figure. 2b,c show the ∆Rxx(B||, T) 2−d colormap at zero D for two filling factors, one
near the ‘underdoping’ of the SC phase at ν = 2.1, and one inside the SC phase, ν = 2.5.
From Figure. 2a, we have seen the presence and absence, respectively, of distinct hysteresis
signatures around these ν values at the operational sample temperature of ∼70mK. Still, as
soon as we increase the effective sample (/bath) temperature, we observe strikingly opposite
behaviors for these two fillings. For ν = 2.1 in Figure. 2b, which sits at the left ‘island’,
∆Rxx gradually diminishes and vanishes completely (∆Rxx ≈0) for T > 650 mK. On the
other hand, for ν = 2.5 in Figure. 2c, where we don’t see any sign of hysteresis, a hysteresis
phase emerges with increasing T above ∼400 mK and gets stronger at T ∼800 mK around
