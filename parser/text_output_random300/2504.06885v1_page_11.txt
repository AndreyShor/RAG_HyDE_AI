Figure 3: The distributions as a function of energy obtained from each method on the 18 variable problem, without
post-selection. Quantum annealing was performed on D-Wave’s 5612 physical qubit Advantage System 6.4. The
VQE results were obtained using a noiseless state vector solver and the real 156 qubit ibm_fez QPU. Experiments
were repeated 10 times to produce accumulated distributions which have been normalised. The minimum constrained
problem energy represented by the red dashed line is −20 in our units. Note that the distribution for the brute force
method is omitted, as it is a trivial delta function distribution centred on the exact solution. The hyperparameters
used for simulated annealing were: λ = 3, the temperature range was set at β = [0.1, 10] with 1000 iterations
(sweeps) and number of repeats = 1000. Quantum annealing with minor embedding: λ = 1, chain strength = 3,
the annealing time = 1400 ns and the number of shots = 1000. For VQE: λ = 3, with the RealAmplitudes ansatz,
using CVaR α = 0.4, COBYLA with tol = 1, and shots = 10000. For random sampling λ = 5 and 1000 samples
were used.

Quantum Annealing Results
The quantum annealing distribution in Figure 3
is skewed closer to the optimal solution than ran-
dom sampling, so it has better general perfor-
mance in the sense of solution quality, as reflected
in the optimal solution probability metrics in Ta-
ble 1. The optimal solution, for the rest of this
section, being the optimal energy among the so-
lutions that respect the fixed vacancy constraint
in the QUBO. However, solutions below the min-
imum constrained problem energy are also found.
This is a consequence of the small penalty coeffi-
cient λ which was found from hyperparameter op-
timisation. If λ is large this increases the QUBO
energy range and results in a smaller spectral gap
in the annealing Hamiltonian.
A smaller spec-
tral gap means that more non-adiabatic effects
are likely, which can cause erroneous results.
Comparing the quantum annealing distribution
in Figure 3 with the post-selected distribution
in Figure 4, we see that the post-selected distri-
bution has support over a smaller range of en-
ergies because high-energy/less-optimal solutions
are invalid and are removed, as expected. The
