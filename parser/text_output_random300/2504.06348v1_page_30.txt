that Rs is a 3ηs

jj′ are the elements of the mass-weighted Hessian ˜Fs, which is real and symmetric
since the PES is real. In this standard form, diagonalization of ˜Fs can be realized by an orthogonal trans-
formation that decouples the quadratic potential term and leaves the form of the kinetic term unchanged,
thereby fully decoupling the harmonic oscillators.
Note, however, that the PES has the global Euclidean symmetry SE(3),

where R, S are an arbitrary translation and rotation. As a result, the force matrix Fs has exactly 6 (or 5
for linear molecules) zero eigenvalues that correspond to the global Euclidean symmetry generators, since
the eigenvectors corresponding to infinitesimal global translations and rotations of the pseudoions incur no
energy cost.
For numerical accuracy, it is important to remove the global Euclidean symmetry before computing the
remaining eigenmodes associated to the internal degrees of freedom. This can be achieved with the following
procedure. First, explicitly define the global translation and rotation vectors in mass-weighted coordinates
as
˜tsx = {
p
MI(1, 0, 0)s
I}I∈Is, ˜tsy = {
p
MI(0, 1, 0)s

˜rsx = {ˆx × ∆˜Rs
I}I∈Is, ˜rsy = {ˆy × ∆˜Rs
I}I∈Is, ˜rsz = {ˆz × ∆˜Rs
I}I∈Is,
which respectively correspond to the action of the generators of translations and rotations on a generic
displacement vector ∆˜Rs
I. Perform a QR decomposition on the 3ηs

columns of the unitary part of the decomposition which, by construction, spans the subspace orthogonal
to the Euclidean transformations. Construct the 3ηs
