We should point out that when ut=0 = u0 = a is a root of f(u) = 0, the first formula
reduces to
u(z) −u0 =
f ′
0
4(℘(z) −1
24f ′′
0 ),
z = z(t),
where f0 = f(u0), f ′
0 = f ′(u0), f ′′
0 = f ′′(u0).
This is very easy to prove (see e.g. Whittaker and Watson, [26]). The first formula
attributed to Weierstrass and Biermann is given in an exercise in [26], but it is difficult
to find complete proofs. This is why we have laboured the point here. We conclude
with the formula for z(t), e.g. for KLMN problems u = 1
r, see Ref.[27]. We leave as an
exercise the corresponding problem for two centres. (See Ref. [5]).
Theorem 7.3. (Restoring the physical time)
