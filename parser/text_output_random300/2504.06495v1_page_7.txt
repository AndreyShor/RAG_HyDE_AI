ance), which argues that quantum symmetries naturally lead to Born-rule probabilities (Zurek
2005).
The consistent histories framework of Griﬃths and Omn`es (Griﬃths 1984, Omnes 1988)
provides a mathematical formalism for quantum probabilities without explicit measure-
ment, though it requires selecting preferred history sets. More recently, Carroll and Sebens
(Carroll and Sebens 2014; Sebens and Carroll 2018) proposed that self-locating uncertainty
within the Many-Worlds picture naturally produces Born rule statistics. Additionally, Glea-
son’s theorem (Gleason 1957) shows that any probability measure satisfying certain assump-
tions must take the Born rule form. Nevertheless, as Landsman notes, “no generally accepted
derivation of the Born rule has been given to date” (Landsman 2009), with many proposals
facing concerns about circularity or hidden assumptions.
Our approach in this paper diﬀers fundamentally from these existing works. We derive
the Born rule as a macroscopic consequence of an augmented Schr¨odinger equation with
small-signal truncation, requiring no additional postulates, decision-theoretic arguments, or
preferred basis selections. This yields a uniﬁed framework in which quantum statistics emerge
naturally from the same fundamental law of motion that governs the dynamics of the quantum
state vector.

Conceptual framework
This section outlines some conceptual foundations. We begin by summarizing how deco-
herence leads to the emergence of distinct quantum branches — this is well-known, but we
include it here to establish the necessary framework for our subsequent discussion.
2.1
Quantum branching through decoherence
The Schr¨odinger equation is a deterministic law of motion that governs how the universal
state vector ψτ evolves over time τ. For our purposes, this state vector describes the quantum
state of the entire physical universe (or multiverse), or at least everything that can plausibly
interact over the relevant time period with a macroscopic observer of a given experiment
