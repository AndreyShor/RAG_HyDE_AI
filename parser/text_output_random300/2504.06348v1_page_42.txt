construct a circuit that applies:
• The controlled unitary |0⟩⟨0| ⊗Wsa + |1⟩⟨1| ⊗W †
sa, r(λt, δ) many times;
• r(λt, δ) single qubit rotations, whose cost is negligible (comparatively speaking);
• The unitary |0⟩⟨0| ⊗W †
sa + |1⟩⟨1| ⊗I and the unitary |0⟩⟨0| ⊗I + |1⟩⟨1| ⊗Wsa once.
The resulting circuit implements a block-encoding of an operator Xt satisfying
∥Xt −e−iHt∥≤δ.
(125)
The circuit uses 1 auxiliary qubit. Note that W †
sa = Usa[Is ⊗(2 |G⟩⟨G|a −Ia)], so we can control between
Wsa and W †
sa by simply controlling the reflection operator on the ancilla:
|0⟩⟨0| ⊗Wsa + |1⟩⟨1| ⊗W †
sa = (|0⟩⟨0| ⊗Is ⊗Ra + |1⟩⟨1| ⊗Is ⊗Ia)(I ⊗Usa)(|0⟩⟨0| ⊗Is ⊗Ia + |1⟩⟨1| ⊗Is ⊗Ra),
where Ra = 2|G⟩⟨G|a −Ia. Hence, the aforementioned circuit block-encoding Xt requires

applications of the unitary Usa (two of which are controlled on the ancilla qubit, i.e., |0⟩⟨0| ⊗Usa and
|1⟩⟨1| ⊗Usa, and the rest are simply Usa), together with singly-controlled reflections on the ancilla qubits
whose cost is negligible compared to the cost of Usa.25
Furthermore, there are additional gates needed
for synthesizing the single-qubit rotations on the QSP’s ancilla qubit, which are again negligible, although
determining the angles may require a potentially challenging classical precomputation. Hence, in our resource
estimates in Sec. 7 we only account for the cost of the repeated application of Usa.

Starting from an imperfect block-encoding of H
In the discussion presented so far, we have assumed access to an exact block-encoding Usa of H/λ. As in
Ref. [62], let us now lift this assumption and assume that we access instead a unitary ˜Usa which block-encodes
an operator ˜H/λ with
∥˜H −H∥≤δBE.
(127)
Applying the procedure discussed in the previous subsection with Usa replaced by ˜Usa, we block-encode an
operator ˜Xt such that
∥˜Xt −e−i ˜
Ht∥≤δ′.
(128)
with a number of applications of ˜Usa as in Eq. (126).
Now, using the triangle inequality, the previous
inequality, and Lemma 50 in Ref. [82],
∥˜Xt −e−iHt∥≤∥˜Xt −e−i ˜
Ht∥+ ∥e−i ˜
Ht −e−iHt∥≤δ′ + |t|∥˜H −H∥≤δ′ + δBE|t|.
(129)
24We note that the upper bound on the degree of the Jacobi-Angers expansion required is likely an overestimate, as an
asymptotic analysis suggests that the constant prefactor of the term scaling with τ may be improved from e/2 to 1 [81].
However, the non-asymptotic extension is nontrivial and rigorous results are not available.
25Note also that the cost of a singly-controlled Usa is almost as the cost of Usa with no control, due to the fact that the
control only needs to be implemented for the Select or the Swap parts of the block-encodings of each Hamiltonian term.
