FIG. 7: Pulse shaping for amplitude and frame rotation
of the MS(θ) gate, a) The amplitude of the waveform
(teal) follows a Gaussian with σ = 0.133τ, while b) the
frame rotation ϕf,i(t) follows the integral of the square
of Gaussian amplitude, erf(
√
2t) (orange), as the
residual light shift is predominantly fourth-order.
rent with the MS gate in order to counteract the influ-
ence of the light shift during the varying amplitude pulse
(Gaussian-shaped). Since the residual light shift is pre-
dominantly due to fourth-order shifts, it is proportional
to the square of the Rabi rate. This means the light shift
will cause the gate to accumulate phase as the integral of
the square of that Gaussian envelope, which is a scaled
error function, erf(
√
2t) (see Fig. 7b). We therefore pro-
gram the frame rotation ϕf,i(t) to also accumulate phase
as erf(
√
2t) spanning the duration of the gate, but with
the opposing sign of the phase from the light shift in
order to cancel it.
To calibrate the magnitude of the correction needed,
we perform two sequential MS(π/2) gates on an initial
state of |00⟩, which should result in complete population
transfer to |11⟩. However, in the presence of light shifts,
the second gate will not be aligned in phase with the fi-
nal state of the first, resulting in less overall population
transfer to |11⟩. Here, we vary the total accumulation
of phase of the frame rotation, which is ϕf,i(t) at t = τ,
or more compactly ϕf,i(τ). We then find ϕf,i(τ) which
corresponds to the maximal |11⟩population, as shown in
the green data of Fig. 8a. During calibrations, we fit the
entirety of the scan with a simple Gaussian curve fitting
routine, taking its center to be the calibrated frame ro-
tation. However, the true functional form is not a Gaus-
sian, and so for more thorough investigations and fidelity
estimations, we utilize a maximum likelihood estimation
that fits a Gaussian only to the upper half of the curve to
extract the amplitude (for fidelity estimations) and the
center (for frame rotation calibrations), demonstrated in
Fig. 8a. When we compare the two different methods to
determine the necessary frame rotation, we find they are
typically within 2° of one another (a example set of 22
calibration measurements yielded an average difference
of 0.95° or ∼1.5% of the Gaussian 2σ).

FIG. 8: Different impacts of the light shift as a function
of ζbr measured with the 2x MS(π/2) gates. a) The
probability in |11⟩after two sequential MS(π/2) gates
vs. ϕf,i(τ). The four different data sets have different
values of ζbr. b) From a), the center of each set is fit to
extract the frame rotation needed to cancel the residual
light shift (orange squares), i.e. the sign of the
measured frame rotation is inverted to indicated the
light shift that is being canceled. The single-qubit
MS(π/2) calibration results in Fig. 5e have been
reproduced (teal diamonds) and assigned the
appropriate directionality (sign) as the original
measurement is unable to determine the sign. The
frame rotation and the single-qubit MS(π/2) Ramsey
measurements were interleaved to reduce the effect of
system drift. A simulation (black curve) based of the
fourth-order light shift resulting from the effect of the
other pulsed laser comb harmonics is fit to the data to
account for imperfect polarization and mismatch
between the intended and actual ζbr at the ion. c) An
estimate of the gate performance, √P11 after two
applications of MS(π/2), as determined from the frame
rotation measurements reveals significant degradation
as ζbr moves away from the ideal 1.05. Error bars in b)
and c) are 2σ confidence intervals either determined
from a maximum likelihood estimation or basic curve
fitting routine.
