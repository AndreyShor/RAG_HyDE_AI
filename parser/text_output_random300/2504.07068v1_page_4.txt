These functions are deﬁned for a given channel N, however, we drop the dependency on the channel for the simplicity
of the notation.
Remark 4. The inﬁmums in the above deﬁnition are attainable, and therefore they can be replaced with minimums.
The ﬁrst optimization is over a compact set of CPTP maps with bounded input and output dimensions. In the second
optimization, system E is an environment system of the map Λ2, which is bounded as |E| ≤|A| · |B| · |K|. Also, the
von Neumann entropy is a concave function of states. Therefore, the inﬁmum is attained by an extremal CPTP map
Λ3 : E →E′. The input dimension of Λ3 is bounded, therefore, the number of the operators in the Kraus representation
of an extremal Λ3 with input dimension E, is |E|. This implies that the dimension of system E′ is bounded as well.

ENTANGLEMENT-ASSISTED SIMULATION
In this section, we obtain that the optimal entanglement-assisted qubit rate is equal to a(ρAR, 0) (where “a” stands
for the assisted rate). So, we ﬁrst prove various properties of this function, which we apply to obtain the optimal rate.
The entanglement-assisted qubit rate means that we allow the encoder and the decoder to consume entanglement at
any rate.
Lemma 5. The function a(ρ, γ) in Deﬁnition 3 has the following properties:
1. It is a non-increasing function of γ.
2. It is convex in γ, i.e., a(ρ, λγ1 + (1 −λ)γ2) ≤λa(ρ, γ1) + (1 −λ)a(ρ, γ2).
3. It is subadditive, i.e. a(ρ1 ⊗ρ2, γ) ≥a(ρ1, γ) + a(ρ2, γ).
4. It is continuous for all γ ≥0.
We prove this lemma in the appendix section B.
Theorem 6. The optimal entanglement-assisted rate for the simulation of the channel N : A →BK is equal to
a(ρAR, 0) where this function is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.
