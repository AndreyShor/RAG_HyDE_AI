which also follows from 6.1, we get the estimate
trUi⊗X[a,b]⊗Uj(x∗

k,0xk,0)
 ≤4δk + 2δ′
k,
showing that tr(y∗
k,i,jyk,i,j) →0 as k →∞.
Finally, let us consider the general a and b. Taking integers a′ < a and b′ > b such that
ia′−m = ia′ and ib′+n = ib′ happen inﬁnitely many times, the above argument says that any
x ∈(A(−∞,a−1] ∨A[b+1,∞))′ ∩A belongs to A[a′,b′]. It remains to show
(A(−∞,a−1] ∨A[b+1,∞))′ ∩A[a′,b′] = A[a,b].
Let us take b′′ > b′ + R. Then, for any object Y ∈Cb+1,b′+1, the irreducible summands of
X∗
[b+1,b′] ⊗Y ∈Cb′+1,b′′ appear as a subobject of X[b′+1,b′′]. In particular, for irreducible Y , we
have a copy of the projection
eY =
1
d(X[b+1,b′])
¯RX[b+1,b′]
¯R∗
X[b+1,b′] ⊗idY
in A[b+1,b′′].
Now, let us take x ∈(A(−∞,a−1] ∨A[b+1,∞))′ ∩A[a′,b′]. The commutation of x and eY implies
(id ⊗trX[b+1,b′])(x)eY = xeY .
Since the map x 7→xeY is a homomorphism from (A(−∞,a−1] ∨A[b+1,∞))′ ∩A[a′,b′] to A[a′,b′′],
and the projections eY for Y ∈Irr Cb+1,b′+1 have joint central support 1, we obtain
(id ⊗trX[b+1,b′])(x) = x,
which means x ∈A[a′,b].
An analogous argument gives x ∈A[a,b], and we are done.

6.2. Algebraic Haag duality.
Proposition 6.4. Assume that the net of algebras A• above deﬁned is of strong generation,
then it satisﬁes algebraic Haag duality.
Proof. Given any ﬁnite interval [a, b] ⊂Z,
A[a,b]c = A(−∞,a−1] ∨A[b+1,∞).
The canonical ∗-homomorphism A[a,b] →(A(−∞,a−1]∨A[b+1,∞))′∩A is injective. Now, if b−a ≥r,
Proposition 6.3 says that it is also surjective, and therefore (A(−∞,a−1] ∨A[b+1,∞))′ ∩A ≃
A[a,b]. This shows that the abstract spin chain A• satisﬁes algebraic Haag duality, taking in
Condition 2.2 the parameter L to be r.

6.3. Charge-transporter generation. We now produce a braided tensor functor F : Z(C) →
DHR(A•), and show the charge transporters for DHR-bimodules in the image of F generate the
quasi-local algebra A.
The center Z(C) is the braided C∗-category PseudoNat(idC, idC) of pseudo-natural equiva-
lences of the identity. An object Z in Z(C) amounts to a collection of invertible 1-morphisms
Zi ∈Ci, for i ∈S, and invertible 2-morphisms cY : Zi ⊗Y →Y ⊗Zj for a 1-morphism Y ∈Cij,
obeying appropriate hexagon axioms.
Given such an object Z = ({Zi}i∈S, cY ) in Z(C), we denote Za = Zia for a ∈Z. For an
interval I = [a, b] consider the correspondence
(6.2)
F[a,b](Z) = HomC(X[a,b], X[a,b] ⊗Zb)
