Figure 1: The blue curve represents a standard Brownian motion −B run up to time b. The light blue
region around the Brownian motion is the area enclosed between the curves [0, b] ∋t 7→−Bt −Rk(t) and
[0, b] ∋t 7→−Bt + Rk(t) for some 0 ≪k ≪b. Roughly speaking, Lemma 4.9 states that, with high
probability, for any j ∈[b −1], the supremum of the field Υb,g(x) in the annulus Aj lies on the vertical
segment at t = j within the light blue region.

Some technical lemmas
In this subsection we collect some technical results that are need for the proofs of Proposi-
tions 4.1 and 4.2. Before proceeding, we emphasise that all the following lemmas have an analogous
counterpart in [BL18, Section 4]. We begin with the following lemma, which is a slightly augmented
version of [BL18, Lemma 4.20], adapted to our setting. For its statement, given k ∈N0, we use the
notation
Gk
def= σ((Bs)s≤k, Z∞) .
Lemma 4.10. There exists a constant c > 0 such that for λ > 0, for all b ∈N sufficiently large,
u ∈[b1/4, b3/4], k ∈[b −1], and any event Ak ∈Gk,

(4.18)
Proof. For simplicity, and without loss of generality, we set λ = 1. The proof of this lemma follows
a similar approach to the proof of [BL18, Lemma 4.20]. We start with the proof of (4.17). Given
b ∈N and k ∈[b −1], we let Ek be the event that the conditions in Definition 4.6 hold for all j ∈[k]
(or j ∈[k]0) with Θk(j), but at least one of these conditions is not satisfied if Θk(j) is replaced by
Θk−1(j). We note that Ek ∈Gk and that {Kb = k} ⊂Ek by definition of Kb. Hence, the probability
on the left-hand side of (4.17) can be bounded from above by
