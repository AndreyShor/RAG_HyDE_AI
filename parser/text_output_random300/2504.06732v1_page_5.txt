we will focus only on the case µN,a > 0 and consider
µS,a > 0 and µS,a < 0 separately.
Let us consider the solution µS,a
=
t2
µN,a−∆Z
of
Eq. (12). The corresponding zero-energy eigenvector in
the double QD has the form

with N =

We see from Eq. (13)
that, if µN,a ≈∆Z, then Ψ0,1↓= (0, 1, 0, 0) · Ψ0 becomes
the dominant term, i.e., |Ψ0,1↓|2 ≈1, and therefore the
state is mainly localized on the first QD. Since the state
is both well localized and at zero energy for two QDs,
adding further sites and superconductivity to achieve the
setup of Fig. 1 has little impact on its energy and wave
function. We also saw above that in the case ΦSOI ≈π
2
the solution µN,a ≈∆Z can readily satisfy the require-
ments for a (near-)zero-energy state in the minimal chain.
In other words, since the state is well localized and close
to zero-energy, we can expect a false PMM in the minimal
chain. Furthermore, we expect that this PMM is related
to a ZEC in the long chain limit. Indeed, we find that
regions of parameter space where |Ψ0,1↓|2 ≈1 host false
PMMs associated with a ZEC, see Fig. 3. It is impor-
tant to emphasize that this ZEC occurs even without the
presence of superconductivity, see Fig. 2(g) and (h), and
therefore it is unrelated to topological superconductivity.
Numerically [see Fig. 3], we also find false PMMs in re-
gions of parameter space in which the analytical solution
of Eqs. (9) and (12) is away from the limit |Ψ0,1↓|2 ≈1
discussed above. In these regions of parameter space, we
find false PMMs without a ZEC. The reason for this is
that once we deviate from the limit |Ψ0,1↓|2 ≈1, the as-
sumption that PMMs satisfy both Eqs. (9) and (12) is
not justified anymore. Instead, the numerical optimiza-
tion algorithm introduced in Ref. [72] searches a solu-
tion to Eq. (9) with a maximized MP. These parameters
will give much less localized states with finite energy in
the double QD system defined in Eq. (11). Therefore,
we do not necessarily expect the numerically optimized
chemical potentials µN/S,n to agree with the analytically
calculated chemical potentials µN/S,a. Nevertheless, we
demonstrate in Appendix C that the analytically calcu-
lated chemical potentials and the numerically optimized
chemical potentials are still relatively close to each other,
which justified the usage of analytical values in Fig. 3
over the entire parameter space.
The second characteristic used to classify false PMMs
is whether they appear for Zeeman energies larger or
smaller than the Zeeman energy that is required to bring
the long chain into the topological phase. The long chain
goes through two topological phase transitions, one is
characterized by a closing of the bulk energy gap at k = 0,
the other one by a bulk energy gap closing at k = π. We
calculate the bulk energy spectrum with the momentum-
space Hamiltonian H(k), which is given in the SM of

FIG. 3.
Classification of true (circles) and false PMMs
(triangles/crosses) in a minimal chain.
The circles, trian-
gles, and crosses in the panels are PMMs classified accord-
ing to Fig. 2 after the chemical potentials µN/S,n are deter-
mined using a numerical optimization algorithm [72], requir-
ing µN,n > 0 and µS,n > 0 [µS,n < 0] in panels (a) and (b)
[(c) and (d)]. Throughout, we keep the Zeeman energy fixed
at ∆Z/∆= 0.8. We note that panels (a) and (b) [(c) and (d)]
show the same numerical results but different analytical re-
sults in the background color.
In panels (a) and (c), the
background color indicates |Ψ0,1↓|2 found using Eq. (13) for
the analytically found chemical potentials µN/S,a that solve
Eqs. (9) and (12). If the degree of the localization is high, i.e.,
|Ψ0,1↓|2 ≈1, then we expect the PMM to be associated with
a ZEC. We see that this agrees with the numerical results,
where the triangle symbols associated with a ZEC are located
in regions where |Ψ0,1↓|2 ≈1. In panels (b) and (d), the back-
ground color indicates whether the PMM appears at Zeeman
energies smaller or larger than the Zeeman energy required
for the chain to enter the topological phase. The Zeeman en-
ergies, at which the topological phase transitions should occur
in the infinite chain, are given by ∆Z,1 < ∆Z,2 [see Eq. (14)
with analytically found chemical potentials µN/S,a that solve
Eqs. (9) and (12)] and they are compared to the fixed Zee-
man energy ∆Z/∆= 0.8 at which we observe the PMMs. If
∆Z < ∆Z,1 < ∆Z,2 (∆Z,1 < ∆Z,2 < ∆Z), then the PMMs
belong to the category “before TP” (“after TP”). The cor-
responding green (orange) background color agrees well with
the classification of the numerically optimized and classified
PMMs (orange and green symbols). If ∆Z,1 ≤∆Z ≤∆Z,2,
then the state is a true PMMs and the corresponding pur-
ple background corresponds well with the numerically de-
termined true PMMs (pink symbols).
In the regions with
a white background, no solution for both Eqs. (9) and (12)
exists. The threshold values for the TR are ∆Eth/∆= 10−4,
∆Qth = 0.01, Mth = 0.3, and Eex,th/∆= 0.05. The gray
dots indicate states that do not satisfy the threshold condi-
tions after the optimization.

termined by det H(k = 0) = 0 and det H(k = π) = 0,
