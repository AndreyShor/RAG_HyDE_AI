Here ψ0 (h1h2) is the compact (two hadron) component of the wave function. The terms in the hamiltonian include originally the in-
terquark potential which also contains the mechanism of confinement, ˆHc, the transition potential between the compact component and the
continuum, ˆV, and the hamiltonian for the two-hadron system. The quantity of interest here is
λ2 = ⟨ψ0|Ψ⟩2 ,
(15)
which is the probability to find the compact component of the wave function in the full wave function and is thus a direct measure of the
composition of the wave function. In earlier works Weinberg demonstrated that the non-perturbative parts of the hadron-hadron interaction
can be absorbed into the effective parameters of the formalism by a proper field redefinition 4 such that to leading order in a momentum
expansion ˆH0
hh = p2/(2µ) [63, 64]. With this one finds for the two-hadron wave function
χ(p) = λ
f(p2)
E −p2/(2µ)
with
f(p2) = ⟨h1h2| ˆV|ψ⟩.

It is straightforward to calculate the scattering amplitude within the same formalism under the assumption that the scattering is dominated
by a single pole. All it takes is to replace in Eq. (10) C by g2
0/(E −M0). Now the scale dependence is to be absorbed into the bare mass
M0 via that renormalisation condition EB = −M0 + g2
0µ/(2π)(Λ −γ), where we used that the analytic continuation of the square root of the
energy on the first sheet (here the focus is on bound states) gives the positive imaginary momentum. Then the scattering matrix reads [8]
TNR =
g2
0
E + EB + g2
0µ/(2π)(ip + γ) .
(19)
For a pure molecule we have λ →0 and accordingly g2
0 →∞. In that limit Eq. (19) agrees with Eq. (12). Moreover, to get from the bare
coupling provided in Eq. (18) to the residue at the pole, it needs to be multiplied with the Z-factor that happens to agree with λ2. This gives
gNR(λ2)2 = λ2g2

which agrees to Eq. (13) for λ2 = 0 when the range corrections are omitted. Eqs. (18) and (19) nicely illustrate what the Weinberg criterion
really does: It measures the importance of the term non-analytic in the energy, p =
p
2µE, which appears since the two-hadron intermediate
state can go on shell and is thus specific for the molecular component, relative to the terms analytic in energy that also appear for compact
structures.
The effective range expansion (ERE) reads
TNR(E) = −2π

1/a + (r/2)p2 −ip ,
(21)
with a and r for the scattering length and the effective range, respectively, and we used the particle physics sign convention for the scattering
length. Matching Eq. (21) and Eq. (19) gives

where Eq. (18) was used to provide relations in terms of the probability λ2. One thus finds that for a pure molecule, λ2 = 0, a = −1/γ +
O (1/β) and r = O (1/β) and for a purely compact structure, λ2 = 1, a = O (1/β) and r →−∞. While the scattering length is very sensitive
to the actual binding energy, it is the effective range that is most sensitive to the binding mechanism and thus to the structure of the state as
will be discussed below. Moreover, because of the range corrections indicated in Eqs. (22) one should not use a and r as input to extract
λ2 [65], but more use the relations to check if, within errors, the properties of a given system are consistent with e.g. a pure molecule
(λ2 = 0).
4This field redefinition is possible only, if there is only one bound-state pole in the system. Otherwise a more complicated treatment becomes necessary [60–62].
