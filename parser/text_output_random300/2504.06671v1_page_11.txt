SRIM code [55] is typically used, while FLUKA code [56] is often applied for simulating neutron-induced 
damage. A representative example is provided in the study by Brodar et al. [57], where they compared 
the spatial distribution of vacancy-related defects introduced by ion implantation (He⁺, C⁺) and neutron 
irradiation within the volume of 4H-SiC. 
However, in both cases (ion implantation and irradiation), a high-temperature annealing step is often 
required to rearrange displaced atoms, remove unwanted defects, and stabilize the desired charge state 
of the defect centers.  
Figure 6 (right) schematically illustrates the most advanced approach to defect engineering, where defects 
are introduced at precise locations and with controlled concentrations. Achieving such a level of precision 
is crucial for the development of scalable quantum technologies but remains a considerable challenge. 
Among the most promising techniques moving toward this goal are laser writing and focused ion beam 
(FIB) implantation. 
Laser writing utilizes ultrafast femtosecond laser pulses to generate point defects at targeted positions 
within the SiC lattice and has demonstrated high spatial precision in defect creation [14]. In contrast to 
conventional broad-beam ion implantation, FIB implantation allows for the delivery of individual ions into 
specific locations, enabling precise control over defect placement with minimal collateral damage [17,18]. 
Despite its advantages in spatial accuracy, FIB implantation typically requires post-implantation annealing 
to activate the desired defect states and repair lattice damage.

energy particle irradiation, ion implantation, and direct writing techniques such as laser writing or focused 
ion beam. On the far right, a top-view image of the sample after direct writing or FIB implantation, reveals 
a well-defined array of defects created with high spatial precision. 
 
3.1 Silicon Vacancies (Vₛᵢ) 
The negatively charged VSi is one of the fundamental intrinsic defects in SiC. VSi is an optically active defect 
and plays a crucial role in quantum applications. Here, an overview of key experimental methods used for 
the creation of silicon vacancies in SiC is given. The commonly employed methods include irradiation and 
ion implantation, both of which typically require post-treatment annealing to remove undesired defects 
introduced during the process and to reach the preferable state. Across various available studies, 4H-SiC 
has been selected as the preferred SiC polytype.
