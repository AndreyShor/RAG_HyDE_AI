Let (xj, wj)j∈N ⊆Rd ×[0, ∞] be an arbitrary enumeration of the atoms of the Poisson point measure
ηγ[µγc] as introduced in Definition 1.5. Consider the collection of measures (µγ,i)i∈[n] constructed
as follows
µγ,i(dx)
def=
X
j∈N
Zγ,i,jwjδxj ,
∀i ∈[n] ,
where (Zγ,i,j)j∈N is a collection of i.i.d. copies of Zγ,i, independent of ηγ[µγc]. Then, the sequence
of measures (µγ,t,i)i∈[n] converges σ(X)-stably to the collection of measures (µγ,i)i∈[n] as t →∞.
Remark 2.15. Let Zγ be the random variable defined by
Zγ
def=
Z
Rd exp(γ(Ψ(y)))dy .
Then, as follows from the proof of Proposition 2.17 below, we have E[Z

] < ∞. In particular,
this implies that Zγ is almost surely finite.
Remark 2.16. Theorem C is significantly more general than [MRV16, Theorem 2.2]. For instance,
taking n = 1 and W1,· = 0, we not only recover Theorem 1.6 but also obtain a relatively explicit
representation for the multiplicative constant appearing in front of the limiting measure. Indeed, the
constant c appearing in [MRV16, page 646] is given by

For γ >

Theorem C is a direct consequence of the following result, the proof of which is given in Section 6.4,
where we compute the joint Laplace transform of the collection of measures (µγ,t,i)i∈[n]. In what
follows, for a measure ν on Rd and a function f : Rd →R, we write ν(f) to denote the integral of f
against ν.
Proposition 2.17. Consider the same setting described in Theorem C. Consider the mapping
Tγ : (C+
