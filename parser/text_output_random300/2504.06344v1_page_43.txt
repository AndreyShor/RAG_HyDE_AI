arising from a nontrivial topological background35 for the two-form ZN gauge field gauging
the 1-form center symmetry, i.e. the plaquette-based (C.5), is quite explicit. An equivalent
interpretation is that a nondynamical center vortex wrapping the λ ̸= µ, ν directions of the
torus and located at (nµ, nν) = (Lµ, Lν) is imposed by the twist [40].
To find fractional instantons, we minimize the SU(N) Wilson action starting from random
configurations, distributed according to the SU(N) Haar measure. The action is minimized
using cooling via SU(2) subgroups [66, 67]. The cooling procedure iteratively minimizes the
action with respect to each link variable in the following way. The part of the action which
depends on Uµ(n) is given by

The case of N = 2 is special since the sum of SU(2) matrices is given by an SU(2) ma-
trix multiplied by a non-negative real number, meaning that M†
µ(n) = αV for α ≥0 and
V ∈SU(2). Since the trace of an SU(2) element is real and bounded by ±2, the optimal
update is Uµ(n) →V . For N > 2 this procedure is generalized, by decomposing the SU(N)
elements into N(N −1)/2 SU(2) subgroups and performing the SU(2) procedure there. One
may generalize this procedure to any plaquette based action, i.e. changing the shape of the
plaquettes used, by appropriately modifying the staples.
Once the action is sufficiently close to the BPS limit, we switch to cooling, via the same
method by appropriately modifying the staples Mµ(n), an improved action by introducing
2 × 2 plaquettes [68, 69] to eliminate the next-to-leading-order, O(a6), terms in the Wilson
action (i.e. we take ϵ = 0 in (C.8)). The improved action takes the form

After minimizing the action, the topological charge of the resulting configuration is calculated
using a n¨aive, but sufficient, discretization of the continuum topological charge. Configura-
tions are confirmed to be BPS by checking that the BPS limit, S = 8π2|Qtop|

is instead characterized by the nontrivial ZN holonomies (determined by nµν(mod N)) of the two-form field
over the noncontractible two-planes of the torus.
