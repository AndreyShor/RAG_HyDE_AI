We show that Earth’s natural environment can serve as a powerful probe for ultralight axion dark
matter. In the presence of global geomagnetic fields, the axions with masses ranging from 10−15 eV–
10−13 eV induce electromagnetic waves in the (sub-) extremely low-frequency band (0.3 −30 Hz)
through the axion-photon coupling. We predict the amplitude of induced magnetic fields in the
Earth-ionosphere cavity, taking the finite conductivity of the atmosphere into account. This allows
us to constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter, gaγ, from the long-term monitoring data of the
low-frequency magnetic fields, resulting in a significant improvement from the previous constraints
down to gaγ ≲4 × 10−13 GeV−1 for axion mass ∼3 × 10−14 eV.
Introduction. Many independent astronomical ob-
servations indicate that the matter content of our Uni-
verse is dominated by an invisible matter component,
referred to as dark matter (DM). DM cannot be de-
scribed by the standard model of particle physics, and
its microscopic origin is one of the greatest mysteries in
cosmology and fundamental physics. Among the var-
ious DM candidates, axion or axion-like particles, ini-
tially introduced to address the strong CP problem in
QCD [1–3], have long been a focal point of interest as
representatives of the ultralight DM candidates, with
masses of the axion DM ma ranging from 10−23eV to
1 eV (e.g., [4–9], see also [10] for a review).
The axion DM can couple with electromagnetic
(EM) fields, described by the interaction Lagrangian,
Lint = (gaγ/4) a Fµν ˜F µν, where a is the axion field,
Fµν is the EM field strength tensor with its dual given
by ˜F µν = ϵµναβFαβ/2, and gaγ represents the cou-
pling coefficient, referred to as the axion-photon cou-
pling. Despite its weak coupling, the interaction offers
a direct way to search for axion in laboratory exper-
iments, simultaneously placing a tight constraint on
gaγ [11–13]. Also, astronomical observations provide
clues about axion by modulating observed photons, al-
tering the lifetimes of astronomical objects, and trig-
gering new phenomena [14, 15]. The absence of these
signatures, therefore, allows us to constrain the cou-
pling parameter gaγ.
In this Letter, we consider a novel search for ax-
ion DM, utilizing the terrestrial EM fields in the ex-
tremely low-frequency (ELF) band. Coupled with the
static geomagnetic field, coherently oscillating axions
permeating the entire Earth can generate monochro-
matic EM waves at a frequency corresponding to the
axion mass. In particular, EM waves generated near
the Earth’s surface at frequencies of 1 Hz ≲f ≲100 Hz
are confined between the Earth’s surface and the iono-
sphere, making the natural environment of the Earth
in the ELF range a powerful window for exploring ul-
tralight axions (see Ref. [16] for a possible window at
the MHz band). The use of such an environment has
been pointed out in [17]. Focusing especially on the
frequency of f ≲10−2 Hz, they have placed a con-
straint on gaγ in the mass range, 2×10−18 eV ≲ma ≲
7 × 10−17 eV, utilizing the magnetometer network on
Earth. Recently, the constraint has been extended to
heavier masses, ma ≲4×10−15 eV, with high-sampling
measurement data [18]. There are other efforts con-
straining the coupling with direct measurements in the
mass range, 10−15 eV–10−12 eV [19–23].
Here, our prime focus is the EM fields at the fre-
quencies of f = 0.3 −30 Hz, whose wavelength is com-
parable or longer than the Earth circumference.
In
contrast to the frequency range of f ≲1 Hz studied
in Refs. [17, 18], resonant behavior of EM waves is
expected, and reliable predictions requires a proper
theoretical modeling that accounts for atmospheric
conductivity.
The present study allows us to ex-
plore an axion signature or to put a tight bound
on the axion-photon coupling across a mass range of
10−15 eV −10−13 eV.

the presence of axions, the Maxwell equations are
modified, and there appear effective charge and cur-
rent through the interaction Lint. If axions comprise
the DM, they have non-relativistic velocity, vDM ∼
