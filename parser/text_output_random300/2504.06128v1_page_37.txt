Lemma 5.4. Given ˆt, c1, c3 P p0, 8q, there exists ¯ϑ P r0, 8q (depending on ˆt, c1, c3) such
that, for any β ě 0, L P N and any probability mass function φ satisfying (5.2) and (5.5)
with constants ˆt, c1 and c3, we have (recall σ2
β from (1.16))

We finally define an exponentially dampened version of RL from (2.5):

We will use this quantity to give a proxy for the second moment E

the next result, proved in Appendix B.4.

In order to achieve condition (5.11), starting from (5.9), it is enough to take ˆλ ě 0 large
enough, as we show in the next elementary result, proved in Appendix B.5.
Lemma 5.6. Recall the constant a´ from (2.4). For any 0 ď ˆλ ď L, we have

We are now ready to describe the strategy of the proof of Theorem 5.2.
5.2. A general estimate. We bound the moments of the partition function exploiting
the functional operator approach developed in [CSZ23a, LZ23, CCR23]. The following general
estimate is extracted from [CCR23, Section 4] (see Appendix B for the details). A comparison
with the original bound from [CSZ23a] is discussed in Remark 5.10.
Theorem 5.7 ([CCR23]). Fix any exponent h P N, h ě 3, system size L P N and coupling
constant β ą 0 small enough, say β ď β0 for a suitable β0 “ β0phq ą 0. Given ˆt ą 0 and
ˆλ ě 0, there are constants Kpˆtq
