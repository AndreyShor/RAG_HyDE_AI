Pz(Bb ∈dx) = (2πb)−1/2e−(x−z)2/(2b)dx, and finally the fact that a time reversed Brownian bridge
is still a Brownian bridge but with starting and final point swapped, we obtain that

Therefore, the conclusion follows since the right-hand side of the previous display coincides with

A,L,b(z, g) as desired.

Proof of Lemma 7.4
The main goal of this section is to prove Lemma 7.4. As in the previous case, the proof follows a
sequence of reduction steps, allowing us to transition from Cλ
A,L,b to Cλ,new
A,L,k,b. Each of these reduction
steps forms a lemma within this section. Recalling the definition (7.7) of the constant Cλ
A,L,b, it is
convenient to introduce the function Gλ
A,L,b : C(Rd) →R given by
Gλ
A,L,b(g)

By plugging the expression (7.6) for the function Fλ
A,L,b into the right-hand side of (7.30), and doing
a change of variables, we get that the expectation of Gλ
A,L,b(gz
b) is equal to

where we recall that Υz
b = Υb + gz
b, where gz
b is the field introduced in (7.4). As before, with a slight
abuse of our previous notation, we have absorbed the expectation with respect to the field gu+x
b
into
the expectation E0,u,b. In what follows, we will implicitly use the fact – previously noted in the proof
of Proposition 6.1 – that the field gz
b satisfies (G1) – (G3) uniformly over all z ≥0. In particular, all
the results derived in Section 4 remain valid for the field Υz
b uniformly over all z ≥0.
The goal is now to simplify the quantity Gλ
(7.31) into a more manageable form through a sequence of
reduction steps. We begin with Lemma 7.11, where we show that the integral over u is concentrated
around
√
b. Next, in Lemma 7.12, we establish that Fλ
b,x−L can be replaced by its truncation at a
large values. Afterward, in Lemma 7.13, we show that the two first two indicator functions on the
second line in (7.31) can be removed. Finally, in Lemma 7.14, we show that Fλ
b,x−L can be replaced
by Fλ
k,x−L for some k ≪b.
