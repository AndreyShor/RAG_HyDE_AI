Figure 1 | Current-induced 180° switching of Néel vector and basic properties of 
FCGT bulk. (a to c) Schematic illustrating current-induced 180° switching of Néel vectors 
in three types of antiferromagnetic devices comprising of antiferromagnet (AFM)/ heavy 
metal (HM) bilayers. The net magnet moments δm in a, b and c, originate from DMI-
induced spin canting, interfacial uncompensated magnetic moment and odd-number vdW 
layers in an A-type AFM, respectively. The Néel vector is defined as: 𝒏𝒏= 𝒎𝒎𝟏𝟏−𝒎𝒎𝟐𝟐, and 
the directions of n and δm are indicated by black arrows. The green spheres with arrows 
denote the current-induced electron spin accumulation in HM, while the red and blue 
spheres with arrows denote two spin sub-lattices in AFMs. (d) Crystal structure of FCGT 
viewed from the top and the side. (e) High resolution transmission electron microscopy 
(HR-TEM) image of FCGT bulk. The elemental atoms are indicated by yellow (Te), blue 
(Ga) and purple (Fe/Co) circles. (f) X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of FCGT bulk and the 
optical image (inset) of FCGT single crystal. (g) Magnetic phase diagram of FCGT bulk 
with applied magnetic field Hz along c-axis. The switching fields for upward (Hup) and 
downward (Hdown) sweeping define the magnetic phases of paramagnet (PM), ferromagnet 
(FM), canted AFM (c-AFM) and AFM.
