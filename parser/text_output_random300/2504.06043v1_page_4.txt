Hadronic molecules and multiquark states
Fig. 2 Illustration of the implications of employing spin symmetry to predict the spin partners of the Y(4230) and Y(4360) in the hadrochar-
monium scenario. Solid lines show masses of the physical states (input or predicted), dashed line the deduced masses of the unmixed
basis states. The 1−−states are used as input — the masses of the predicted spin partner states are approximate only. Figure adapted

quantum numbers 1−+, which cannot be generated for ¯cc states, that is near degenerate with another ηc state. This spectrum nicely shows
how using spin symmetry allows for testable predictions for assumed underlying structures for the exotic states. Similar arguments can be
applied to decay patterns. For example, in [22] it is argued that, if Zc(4100) and Zc(4200), also known as Tc¯c1(4100)+ and Tc¯c1(4200)+,
respectively, were hadrocharmonia with seeds ηc(2S ) and ψ(2S ), respectively, their partial widths to final states containing the core state
and a pion should be equal up to spin-symmetry violating corrections.
The building blocks of hadrocharmonia are color neutral by construction, since the core states are conventional charmonia. Thus,
one might be tempted to put them into one class with hadronic molecules to be discussed in Sec. 3. However, while hadronic molecules
typically have masses close to the thresholds of the channels that form the molecule, which can result in hadrons of unusually large size,
hadroquarkonia can be in mass quite far above the most pertinent threshold and accordingly show typical hadronic sizes. For example, the
Y(4230) mentioned above is more than 600 MeV heavier than the sum of the masses of the J/ψ and the lightest scalar-isoscalar resonance,
the f0(500). For the Y(4230) the hadrocharmonium and hadronic molecule picture are contrasted in Ref. [20]. The only case discussed so
far in the literature that could be viewed as both a hadronic molecule and a hadrocharmonium is ψ(4660) also known as Y(4660), which is
proposed to have a substructure made of a ψ(2S ) and an f0(980) [16, 23]. A prediction that will allow for a test of this proposal is that, if
the assumed structure is correct, there needs to be a pseudoscalar bound state formed of ηc(2S ) and f0(980), located at around 4616 MeV
(lighter than the Y(4660) by the ψ(2S )-ηc(2S ) mass difference) with a partial width into ηc(2S )ππ of 60 ± 30 MeV [24].
Clearly, for doubly heavy states of the type QQ¯q¯q like the Tcc(3875)+ discovered at LHCb, one may expect in the spirit of this section
a compact QQ core surrounded by a light ¯q¯q cloud. Thus, here the building blocks are (anti-)diquarks and thus qualify at the same time as
compact tetraquarks. This kind of states is discussed in some detail at the end of the next section.
2 Compact Tetraquarks
The crucial building blocks of compact tetra- and pentaquarks are (anti-)diquarks—for a review about diquark properties we refer to
Ref. [25]. Since quarks (antiquarks) live in the color [3] ([¯3]) representation, a quark (antiquark) pair lives either in the color [¯3] or the color
[6] ([3] or [¯6]) representation. In many works as well as here, only the diquarks in the color [¯3] representation are being kept, motivated, e.g.,
by the observation that at least for the one gluon exchange only in this quark-quark channel the interaction is attractive. Thus (anti-)diquarks
carry a color charge and are therefore subject to confinement—the hadrons with these as building blocks are necessarily compact with their
size given by the confinement radius. Model calculations reveal that the scalar (spin 0) diquarks are lighter than the axial-vector diquarks
(spin 1)—this is why they were dubbed good and bad diquarks, respectively. With this being said, one finds for the basis states forming
doubly heavy tetraquarks [26] two states with S C
h = 0+,
|0+⟩= |0cq, 0¯c¯q; S h = 0⟩, |0+′⟩= |1cq, 1¯c¯q; S h = 0⟩,

three states with S h = 1
|A⟩= |1cq, 0¯c¯q; S h = 1⟩, |B⟩= |0cq, 1¯c¯q; S h = 1⟩, |C⟩= |1cq, 1¯c¯q; S h = 1⟩,
