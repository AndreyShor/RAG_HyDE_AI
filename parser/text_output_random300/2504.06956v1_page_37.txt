Local structure of extremal points

Hence, noting that the deterministic term appearing in âˆ‚2
i,kÎ¥b,g is bounded by a constant independent
of b, it holds that

Now, we observe that, for b â‰¥0 sufficiently large, thanks again to Lemma 4.10, it holds that

By Lemma 4.26 and (G3), there exist constants c1, c2 > 0 such that
P(E0) â‰²edjâˆ’c1Î·4/d â‰¤eâˆ’c2Î·4/d ,
where the last inequality follows thanks to the fact that j/2 â‰¤log rÎ·. Combining the above bound
with (4.61) yields the claim in this case.
Case 3: Finally, we consider the following case:
0 â‰¤log rÎ· < j
2 .
(4.62)
Arguing as above, and using Lemma 4.10, by taking b â‰¥0 sufficiently large, we can restrict ourselves
to the event {Kb < log rÎ·}. We observe that, by (4.62) and Lemma 4.9,
{M0,b(Î¥b,g) â‰¤Î», Kb < log rÎ·} âŠ†

Now, recalling (4.56), we show that for suitable values of r âˆˆ(0, rÎ·] and M â‰¥(log Î·)2, we can
restrict to the event {Sr â‰¤M}. Indeed, arguing exactly as in the previous case, we have that
{Sr > M, Kb < log rÎ·} âŠ†

def= E1 .
By Lemma 4.26 and (G3), there exists a constant a > 0 such that
P(E1) â‰²rdeâˆ’aM 2 .
(4.64)
By combining this with (4.13) and (4.17) of Lemma 4.10, we find that
P0,u,b(M0,b(Î¥b,g) â‰¤Î», Kb < log rÎ·, Sr > M) â‰²u

P(E1) .
Hence, recalling (4.64), this implies that we can impose finitely many conditions of the type {Sr â‰¤M}
provided that the parameters r and M are such that rdeâˆ’aM 2 â‰²Î·âˆ’Î² for some Î² > 2. In our particular
case, we can use this to impose
{SrÎ· â‰¤cÎ»Î·

and
{S1 â‰¤(log Î·)4} ,
(4.65)
where cÎ» > 0 is the same constant introduced in Remark 4.25. Therefore, it remains to show the
bound in the statement for the event

We note now that the first condition in (4.65) implies that if the maximum is achieved within the
ball of radius rÎ·, then there is a ball of area at least Î·âˆ’1 around that maximum where Î¥b,g is greater
than its maximal value minus Î». This however cannot happen if |DÎ»
