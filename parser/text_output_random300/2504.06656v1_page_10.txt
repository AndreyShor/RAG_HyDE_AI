For every applicant, this weight-adjusting procedure is repeated. Assuming that the set of weights
that minimizes the error function has been found throughout the learning phase, the ﬁnal set of
weights is selected from the last candidate and utilized to generate the classiﬁer response with
the aid of the neuron response function.
In this work, we have used 3710 signals and 102790
background events that correspond to the integrated luminosity of 3000fb−1. The cuts of P jet
