scalar mass of 125 GeV and couplings similar to the known Higgs boson are selected for numerical
assessment based on theoretical considerations.

TWO HIGGS DOUBLET MODEL TYPE III
The Two Higgs Doublet Model Type III (2HDM-III) expands the Standard Model by incor-
porating two scalar Higgs doublets, labeled as H1 and H2. This model enhances the interaction
structure, especially in Yukawa couplings that govern the connections between Higgs ﬁelds and
fermions. Here is a theoretical overview of the Lagrangian and Yukawa couplings in the 2HDM-III.
The Lagrangian of the 2HDM consists of kinetic terms, potential terms, and Yukawa interaction
terms. In the Yukawa sector, the scalar to fermion couplings are described by the most general
expressions:
−LY = ¯
QLY u
1 UR ˜
Φ1 + ¯
QLY u
2 UR ˜
Φ2 + ¯
QLY d
1 DRΦ1 + ¯
QLY d
2 DRΦ2 + ¯LY l
1lRΦ1 + ¯LY l
2lRΦ2 +H.C. (1)
where QL = (uL, dL) and L = (ℓL, νL) are the doublets of SU(2)L, and Y f,ℓ
1,2 represent the 3 ×
3 Yukawa matrices.
To maintain control over ﬂavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) while
still generating ﬂavor-violating Higgs signals [1–5] in the context of a Two Higgs Doublet Model
(2HDM), a common approach is to impose a ﬂavor symmetry that constrains the structure of the
Yukawa matrices. This allows one to keep the oﬀ-diagonal terms small, thereby suppressing FCNCs,
while still enabling interesting ﬂavor-dependent processes. The non-diagonal Yukawa couplings in
this ﬂavor-symmetric scenario can be modeled as:

COLLIDER PHENOMENOLOGY
To establish a clear and structured analysis within a Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) frame-
work, one often deﬁnes speciﬁc benchmark points (BPs) in the parameter space to facilitate predic-
tions and comparisons with experimental results. Here are three hypothetical benchmark points
(BPs) that could be considered.
These points are typically chosen to represent scenarios with
varying degrees of ﬂavor violation and charged Higgs boson masses or couplings [6]: A. BP1: tan
