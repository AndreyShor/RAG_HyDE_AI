Extended Data Fig. 7 | ρxx-νh-B maps measured with different contact pairs. Symmetrized 
ρxx at D = -5 mV/nm and T = 300 mK, measured with different contact pairs. The lower panels 
show the corresponding measurement configurations. The measurement results obtained from 
the two configurations are in excellent agreement. The results of ρxx shown in the main figures 
were mainly measured using the configuration shown in a.
