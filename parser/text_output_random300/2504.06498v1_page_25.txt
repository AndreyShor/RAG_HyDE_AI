Figure S1: The spectral amplitude and noise floor versus FT duration. The FT spectra were
obtained from the time-domain quantum oscillator signal (Fig. 1D) in using sliding time windows
starting at 100 s with increasing durations. The noise floors were sampled over 8-10 Hz range. Solid
lines are fits to the data using a linear function for the spectral amplitude and a square-root function
for the noise floor. Consequently, the SNR of the oscillator signal scales as the square-root of the
acquisition time.
