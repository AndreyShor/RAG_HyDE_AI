cross section and differential distributions. In Ref. [738], a triple-differential analysis has been
carried out at NNLOQCD + NLOEW. In addition, partial N3LOQCD as well as higher-order EW
corrections are supplemented where appropriate.
Beyond developments for QCD corrections, mixed QCD–EW corrections have been inves-
tigated further. The two-loop mixed QCD–EW amplitude to the charged current Drell–Yan
has been computed [739]. The computation is done with massive leptons, thereby regularizing
the associated collinear singularities. The results can be used in terms of numerical grids. In
Ref. [740], the corrections of initial–initial type were computed, thus completing the full mixed
QCD–EW in the pole approximation. Various differential distributions are discussed along the
forward–backward asymmetry. Following on this, the full calculation, valid over the full range
for the neutral current has been studied again in Ref. [224]. In particular, a study of bare muons
is presented there.
In Ref. [741], resummation at NLL accuracy for both EW and mixed QCD-EW correc-
tions has been presented. These corrections are then combined to N3LL corrections to provide
state-of-the-art differential predictions for the neutral and charged process. In the same spirit,
Ref. [742] presented the qT resummation of NLL accuracy in QED, LL accuracy for mixed
QCD-EW effects, and NNLL accuracy in QCD. In Ref. [743], the ResBos programm has been
promoted to NNLOQCD + N3LL
accuracy.
Along the same line, a new independent calcu-
lation at NNLOQCD + N4LL’ accuracy has presented [744]. Finally, Ref. [745] also presented
results at N3LL’ accuracy and approximate N4LL in resummed perturbation theory, matched
to the available O(α3
s) fixed-order results. In addition, parametric uncertainties associated to
αs, the collinear parton distribution functions, and the non-perturbative transverse momentum-
dependent (TMD) dynamics are discussed.
With the recent advance in theoretical predictions, several phenomenological studies have
been carried out. For example, in Ref. [746] the idea of probing the running of the weak-mixing
angle has been explored, with a focus on the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC. To that end,
a new version of the Powheg implementation of EW corrections has been released where both
on-shell and MS renormalisation scheme can be used. New ideas on how to extract the W-boson
mass at hadron colliders have also been promoted [747], where also higher-order corrections
are discussed. Finally, the sensitivity of theoretical predictions to PDFs has been discussed in
Ref. [748] by focusing on the forward-backward asymmetry.

LH21 status: Z + j [140,142,249–251], W + j [142,246,251,252], and γ + j [139,254] completed
through NNLOQCD including leptonic decays; all processes of this class, and in particular their
ratios, investigated in great detail in Ref. [313], combining NNLOQCD predictions with full NLO
EW and leading NNLOEW effects in the Sudakov approximation, including also approximations
for leading N(1,1)LOQCD⊗EW effects, devoting particular attention to error estimates and corre-
lations between the processes. Subleading EW corrections known for Z + j [749]; NNLOQCD
known for polarised W + j [366]; NNLOQCD known for Z + b [148] and W + c [185];
NLOQCD with parton-shower corrections for mass charm for W + c known [750].
Processes featuring a vector boson produced in association with a flavoured jet have be-
come of increasing interest in the last few years. One of these is W +c production, which provides
sensitivity to the strange-quark content of the proton. To that end, NNLOQCD corrections re-
taining full CKM-matrix dependence have been computed, along with NLOEW corrections [186].
In addition, the influence of flavored jet algorithms and the experimental definition of the pro-
cess has been investigated. This work has been followed by a comparison with CMS measure-
ment [751] which showed good agreement. In Ref. [150], the same calculation was performed,
