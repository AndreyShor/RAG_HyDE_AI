hydrodynamic instablities74;75 in the non-rotating CLES models and a standard model (for the
GN93 abundances), not including any of such effects.
The formalism for macroscopic transport in Eggenberger et al. (2022)32 is based on the trans-
port of angular momentum in stellar radiative zones under the hypothesis of shellular rotation,
combining the shear instability, the meridional circulation, and the Tayler-Spruit dynamo76. In
such conditions, the vertical transport of chemical elements follows a diffusion equation

with Xi a given chemical species, ρ the local density, r the radial position of a given isobar and
DX a diffusion coefﬁcient that accounts for the impact of the additional physical processes. The
shear diffusion coefﬁcient we consider is from Talon & Zahn (1997)77 and includes the effects
of the stabilizing mean molecular weight gradient in the analytical expression. This coefﬁcient
is written
DX ≈

with Dh the horizontal turbulence coefﬁcient, Ric the critical Richardson number, dU/dz =
r sin θ(dΩ/dr), the shear rate, K the thermal diffusivity and Nµ =

r AT the
chemical and thermal contribution to the Brunt-V¨ais¨al¨a frequency.
The asymptotic formulation for the diffusion coefﬁcient is derived by assuming that the denom-
inator can be simpliﬁed to the sole contribution of the mean molecular weight gradient. Namely
that N2
T/(K + Dh) ≪N2
µ/Dh and that the shear rate will be determined by the condition for the
Tayler-Spruit instability to set in, in regions where mean molecular weight gradients dominate.
This condition states that
