Note that because of the factorization in the collinear
limit, the integral over pk does not act on the initial den-
sity matrix.
To generalize this map, one can consider
next-to-soft and next-to-collinear emissions which will
lead to next-to-leading-log terms. One could also con-
sider emissions from both f and ¯f, which are formally
higher-order as well as higher loops or double emission.
All these effects will then generalize the derived maps
and will be explored in forthcoming studies.

CONCLUSION
The study of entanglement at colliders is evolving into
a more established research field. Quantum effects that
have been so far neglected, such as decoherence due to
strong or electroweak radiation and in general higher-
order corrections in the gauge couplings need to be con-
sidered when comparing theory and data. A formalism
that interprets such radiation effects in particle physics
in terms of quantum information process is therefore
needed.
In this study, we have demonstrated a proof-of-concept
approach to modeling decoherence effects arising from
soft and collinear radiation in spin entanglement at col-
liders, using standard quantum field theory techniques.
Employing the decay of a scalar boson to a f ¯f pair as a
simplified example, we showed that radiative emissions,
both real and virtual, can be represented as quantum
maps that introduce decoherence effects.
Notably, we
identified a correspondence between Kraus operators and
the integrated Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions. This
framework could prove valuable for quantum accurate
simulations of parton showers, see, e.g., [63]. Further-
more, it would be worthwhile to extend this correspon-
dence to higher-order splitting functions.
While centered on a simplified example, this initial ex-
ploration outlines a general approach that can be broadly
applied to the study of decoherence in other entangled
systems. Using our framework, it is possible to estimate
the magnitude of such effects at colliders. The simple
case presented here could already be used for t¯t pro-
duction at threshold—where the pair is in a spin-singlet
scalar state—as well as in h →τ +τ −.
Applications
to other f ¯f final states, such as e+e−→τ +τ −, t¯t, or
pp →τ +τ −, t¯t, are straightforward. These, along with
the study of higher-order effects, are left for future work.
