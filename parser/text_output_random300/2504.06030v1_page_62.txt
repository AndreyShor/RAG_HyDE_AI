We stress here that all this follows for X(x) = (a, b, c, d, e)(x, 1)4, for the choice of
Euler’s constant C = 4(s + c), defining the new integration variable s. This s is just a
fractional linear function of x e.g. as Greenhill [14, pp154] shows, if X(x) has 4 distinct
roots: α, β, γ, δ, one choice could be
s = a

Recalling that in our KLMN problem the Lorentz force is the crucial new element and
the Lorentz group is intimately related to SL(2, C), it is not surprising that the fractional
linear transformation group with non-zero determinant, PSL(2, R), appears here.
