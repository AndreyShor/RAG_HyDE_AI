realizing a topological interface between SZ4 and SZω
2 . Precisely, the 1-form sym-
metry to be gauged is generated by the line operator exp(πi∮a1 + ˆb1). Coupling
the background ﬁeld c2 for this 1-form symmetry to the theory SZ4 and summing
it over, we derive
∑
c2
exp(iSZ4)exp (πi∫M3
c2(a1 + ˆb1)).
(6.11)
It is easy to see c2 serves as a Lagrangian multipler, imposing the condition
a1 + ˆb1 = 0.
(6.12)
Substituting the above condition into SZ4 we have
exp (2πi
2 ∫M3
a1 ∪δˆa1 + 1
2a1 ∪δa1 −b1 ∪δa1).
(6.13)
We can then integrate by part and write down
exp (2πi
2 ∫M3
a1 ∪δˆa1 + 1
2a1 ∪δa1 −a1 ∪δb1 + 2πi
2 ∫M3
δ(a1 ∪b1)).
(6.14)
Redeﬁning ˆa −b →ˆa, we obtain Sω
Z2 theory
exp(2πi
2 ∫M3
a1 ∪δˆa1 + 1
2a1 ∪δa1)
(6.15)
up to a 2D boundary term
exp(πi∫M2 a1 ∪b1).
(6.16)
After shrinking the 3D bulk supporting the SZ4, the above 2D boundary term
subject to the boundary condition (6.9) becomes the SPT
exp (iπ ∫M2
A1 ∪B1)
(6.17)
stacked on the topological boundary of the Sω
Z2 theory. This reproduces the dis-
cussion at the beginning of Section 6.2. See Figure 5 for an illustration.
