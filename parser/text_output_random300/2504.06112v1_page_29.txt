small-world network (Fig. 13(a)) and a random graph network (Fig. 13(b)). As observed, in
both network structures, increasing µ significantly enhances cooperation within the system
and raises the threshold for the disappearance of cooperative behavior, which is consistent
with previous findings. Furthermore, in Fig. 13(a), at approximately b ≈1.375, cooperation
within the small-world network increases regardless of the value of µ. However, in the ran-
dom graph network model (Fig. 13(b)), when µ ≥0.6, cooperative behavior persists across
the entire system regardless of b. This suggests that, compared to the small-world network,
µ is more effective in promoting cooperation in the random graph network model.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we proposed a multi-game model with limited resources that integrates
an advantageous environmental mechanism, where individual fitness is dynamically rede-
fined based on both self-payoff and the payoffs of social peers. This framework captures
the co-evolution of strategies and resource allocation across two distinct game types: the
Snowdrift Game (SDG) and the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (PDG). By adopting an adap-
tive control approach, we examined system behavior across multiple resolution levels —
