2. Quantum Plasma dynamics 
We consider a collisionless electron-positron-ion quantum plasma, in the presence of 
constant external magnetic field along the z direction 
0 ˆ

 and an external electrostatic 
wave E

, where is the electrostatic potential interacts with the plasma. The plasma is 
assumed to be rotating in the astrophysical settings with angular frequency Ω , at an angle θ to 
the direction of the magnetic field. 
We perform linear analysis by considering the electrostatic wave to propagate obliquely to 
the external magnetic field in the x-z plane, i.e.,

2.1. Fermion dynamics 
The momentum and continuity equations for fermions, considering spin-up and spin-
down states as separated species of particles, with the subscript j = e, p denoting the electron and 
positron, respectively, are
