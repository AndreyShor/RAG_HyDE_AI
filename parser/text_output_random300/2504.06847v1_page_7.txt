Gaussian 09W software [36] was used for quantum chemical computations concerning 
geometry optimization, followed by vibrational frequency calculations of 2-Amp(1+) cation. 
Raman intensities were calculated by the RAINT programme [37], and the assignment of the 
computed vibrational modes (see Table S12, Supplementary material) is based on the 
visualization of the vibrations using the GaussView programme [38] and performed PED 
analysis by the VEDA4 programme [39]. Table S13, Supplementary material, contains the 
comparison of recorded vibrational spectra of reference 2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) chloride 
hemihydrate (2-AmpCl½H2O) with computed normal modes (scaled by dual scaling [40] or 
wavenumber-linear scale “WLS” [41] procedures). 
Solid-state DFT computational studies of 2-AmpH2PO3 focused on vibrational spectra and 
optical properties were carried out using the CRYSTAL17 program [42]. Three approaches 
named “B3LYP”, “B3LYP-advanced”, and “PBESOL0”, differing in functional and basis sets, 
were selected.  
For details of all quantum chemical computations performed, see the Supplementary 
material.  
 
 
2.4. Crystal growth of 2-AmpH2PO3  
The solubility of 2-AmpH2PO3 crystals in water is highly temperature-dependent and 
increases from 76.9 g/L (293 K), 93.6 g/L (298 K), 178.2 g/L (303 K), 237.2 g/L (308 K), and 
311.5 g/L (313 K) to 373.1 g/L (318 K). Large single crystals of 2-AmpH2PO3 were grown 
from aqueous solutions using both methods, controlled solvent evaporation at constant 
temperature or slow temperature lowering within the 45-35°C range. The best results were 
obtained by controlled solvent evaporation at 38°C. During a 12 - 14 weeks growth period, 
crystal with dimensions of up to 4 x 3 x 1 cm3 with optically clear volume of approx. 1 cm3 
resulted. The quality of the obtained crystals strongly depends on the purity of the starting 
chemicals and several steps of purification by recrystallization were therefore necessary. In Fig. 
1 an example of a grown single crystal of 2-AmpH2PO3 is given. 
 
2.5. Linear optical properties 
 
Refractive indices and their wavelength dispersion of the monoclinic crystals of 2-
AmpH2PO3 were measured using the prism method and a high-precision goniometer-
spectrometer (Möller-Wedel; for instrumental details see, e.g., [43]). For monoclinic crystals,
