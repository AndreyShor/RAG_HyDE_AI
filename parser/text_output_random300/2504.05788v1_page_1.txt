Abstract.
The non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) approach offers a
practical framework for simulating various phenomena in mesoscopic systems. As
the dimension of electronic devices shrinks to just a few nanometers, the need for
new effective-mass based 3D implementations of NEGF has become increasingly
apparent.
This work extends our previous Finite-Volume implementation—
originally developed for the self-consistent solution of the Schr¨odinger and Poisson
equations in 2D—into a full 3D NEGF framework. Our implementation begins
with exploring a few problems with the common textbook Finite Difference
implementations of NEGF. We then concisely demonstrate how Finite-Volume
discretization addresses few key implementation challenges.
Importantly, we
explain how this type of discretization enables evaluating the self-energies, which
account for the effects of reservoirs. The potential applications of this new method
are illustrated through two examples. We anticipate that this implementation will
be broadly applicable to open quantum systems, especially in cases where a fully
three-dimensional domain is essential.
Keywords: non-equilibrium Green’s function, effective-mass, Finite-Volume, three-
dimensional domain.
