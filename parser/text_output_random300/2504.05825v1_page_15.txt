 with the variation of stretched coordinate (ξ) with electrostatic potential (ϕ). The 
results demonstrate a significant rise in the electrostatic potential of the soliton's profile when 
quantum correction terms, linked to Fermi pressure, the quantum Bohm potential, and spin 
effects of fermions are integrated into the quantum plasma. These quantum corrections induce 
energy redistribution and increased electron occupancy in higher energy states, ultimately 
enhancing the stability and dynamics of solitons. Consequently, there is an overall enhancement 
in the electrostatic potential associated with the soliton profile of 60% within the quantum 
plasma. 
Figure 5 shows the variation of stretched coordinate (ξ) with electrostatic potential (ϕ) for 
soliton profile for varying ion density. The electrostatic potential of the soliton profile decreases 
by approximately 50% with increase in ion density. As the density increases, the balance of 
forces within the soliton structure is altered. The increased Fermi pressure and quantum effects 
can lead to a redistribution of charge and energy within the soliton, causing the electrostatic 
potential to decrease. The Fermi pressure tends to resist compression, as the particle density
