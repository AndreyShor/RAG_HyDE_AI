Topological strings and mirror symmetry
We now discuss the topological string A-model on a background (X, α), where X is an almost
generic Calabi-Yau threefold and α ∈B(X) the topology of the ﬂat B-ﬁeld, as well as the
B-model on the corresponding mirror Calabi-Yau Wα.
We will denote by ρ : b
X →X some choice of small resolution of X, the choice of which
doesn’t matter but will be kept ﬁxed throughout the discussion. The set of nodes in X will
be denoted by S ⊂X and Cp for p ∈S is the exceptional curve over the node p. The smooth
deformation of X will be denoted by e
X. We will assume that H2( e
X, Z) = Z and that the
torsion of X is
B(X) = Tors H3( b
X, Z) = ZN ,
(3.1)
for some N ≥1. The class α can then be represented by an integer k ∈{0, . . . , N −1} and
we denote the equivalence class by α = [k]N ∈ZN. Note that the case N = 1 corresponds to
the usual situation where X = e
X is already a smooth projective Calabi-Yau threefold.
We will assume that the B-ﬁeld stabilizes all of the nodes, i.e.
gcd(k, N) = 1.
The
reason is that “unstable nodes”, by which we mean nodes that are resolved by exceptional
curves which have a trivial B-ﬁeld holonomy, can always be removed by a complex structure
deformation and do not aﬀect the A-model topological string partition function.

Topologically non-trivial B-ﬁelds and torsion reﬁned GV-invariants
Since a singular Calabi-Yau is not a manifold, the notion of the K¨ahler cone is no longer well-
deﬁned. However, it can be naturally replaced by the cone of ample divisors. This is because
of Kleiman’s criterion, which states that a line bundle on a projective scheme is ample if and
only if the degree on every non-zero element in the closure of the cone of eﬀective curves is
positive. In all of our examples, the cone of ample divisors is one-dimensional and we denote
the generator by J ∈Pic(X). In a slight abuse of terminology, we still refer to ωX = t J as
the complexiﬁed K¨ahler form on X and call t the complexiﬁed K¨ahler parameter. 9
We denote by ZX
top.(t, [k]N, λ) the A-model topological string partition function on (X, [k]N )
with complexiﬁed K¨ahler parameter t. It was observed in [14], and subsequently in [15, 16],
that the usual expansion of the topological string partition function in terms of Gopakumar-
Vafa invariants [17, 18] has to be modiﬁed if k ̸= 0. For general k, it takes the form

9The corresponding metric can be obtained by performing an inﬁnitesimal smoothing and applying the
Calabi-Yau theorem.
10The appearance of the phase in the context of smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds with torsion was also remarked
in [50]. At genus zero it has been pointed out for singular Calabi-Yau threefolds in [13] and, in the smooth
case, was applied in [51, 52].
