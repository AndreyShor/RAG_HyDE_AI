Mirror symmetry and the conifold transitions b
Xr →(X, [1]2)
We now want to ﬁnd the fundamental periods of the mirrors of the Calabi-Yau backgrounds
(Xa, [1]2) for a = 1, 2. To this end, we ﬁnd a limit that is mirror to the transition b
Xr
a →
(Xa, [1]2). The behaviour of the ﬂat coordinates in this limit allows us to deduce the presence
of the ﬂat but topologically non-trvial B-ﬁeld. We will ﬁrst discuss the transitition b
Xr
1 →
(X1, [1]2) in detail and then provide the corresponding expressions for (X2, [1]2).
The transition b
Xr
1 →(X1, [1]2)
Using the techniques from [2, 3, 63] we can easily write
down the fundamental period of the mirror of b
Xr
1. It takes the form

Let us ﬁrst ﬁnd the values for z1, z2, z3 that are mirror to points at which we can perform
a conifold transition from b
Xr
1 to X1. We can focus on the slice of the moduli space where
z1 = z2 = z3 = z. Taking also the limit v →0 and using the Frobenius method, we obtain
the relevant logarithmic period

From this we can conclude that, in the limit v →0, the complexiﬁed volume of the exceptional
curves Cp that resolve the nodes p ∈Xr is given by
VolC(Cp) =

Recall that we want to smoothen the nodes of Type B and therefore we want the com-
plexiﬁed volume of the curves Cp for p ∈SB
1 to be trivial. Since the B-ﬁeld holonomy is only
deﬁned up to shifts by integers, this amounts to the condition 2te ∈Z. We thus ﬁnd two
points that allow for the desired conifold transition,
lim
z→1/3 te(z) = 0 ,
lim
z→1 te(z) = 1
2 .
(4.30)
In the limit z →1/3 the complexiﬁed volume of all of the exceptional curves vanishes and
therefore we can perform a conifold transition from b
Xr
1 to the generic smooth quintic Calabi-
Yau e
X1. Indeed, we can perform a suitably regularized limit of the mirror fundamental period
and ﬁnd
