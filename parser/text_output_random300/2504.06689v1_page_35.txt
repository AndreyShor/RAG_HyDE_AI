to two jets at tree level. These amplitudes can be used for NNLOQCD calculations to top-pair
production.
The scale dependence of top-pair production has been investigated in several renormal-
isation schemes in Ref. [945]. This is particularly important for the experimental extraction
of the top quark mass, especially in the low top-pair invariant mass regime. Along the same
line of research, a study [946] of the top-quark pole mass extraction has been carried out at
NNLOQCD accuracy, using total, single-, and double-differential cross sections. In Ref. [188],
non-perturbative fragmentation functions, for B-hadrons, J/Ψ and muons resulting from semilep-
tonic B decays have been derived at NNLOQCD. These fragmentation functions are then used
to study the production of top-quark pairs with these final states.
In Ref. [947], the first event generator at NLOQCD accuracy matched to parton shower for
the off-shell production of a top-quark pair in the lepton+jets channel has been presented. This
implementation also allows the separation between tW and t¯t production mechanisms.
In Refs. [948, 949], the differential transverse momentum and azimuthal decorrelation of
the top-quark pair have been computed with degrees of fixed-order accuracy combined with
resummation, including NNLL +NNLOQCD accuracy.
Particular emphasis has been put on
the interplay between soft-collinear resummation and Coulomb singularities. In Ref. [950], the
computation of the soft-parton contributions at low transverse momentum of the top-quark pair
up to NNLOQCD has been presented. This is the final ingredient for the implementation of the
qT subtraction formalism at NNLOQCD for top-quark production.
