while, we also exploit the Wilson-loop technique to track
the evolution of 1D Berry phase λz(ky) as a function of
ky. As shown in Fig. 3 (b), the Wilson loop spectrum
displays a gapless helical winding pattern with robust
Kramers degeneracies at ky = 0 and π. Both topological
invariant calculations have thus established an emergent
2D Z2 TSC phase at the pairing domain, agreeing with
this intuitive boundary picture.
On the other hand, the infinite µ limit should always
yield a trivial JT, which we have numerically confirmed
for a reasonably large µ of our setup. Consequently, as we
increase µ from 0 to ∞, there must exist a critical doping
µ(J)
c
where JT changes from ν0 = 1 to ν0 = 0, further
manifesting as a zero-energy gap closure at one of the
TRIMs. In Fig. 3 (a), we numerically plot the dispersion
relation of Andreev bound states at ˜Γ, i.e., ky,z = 0, as a
function of µ. Indeed, a pair of JT transitions at ±µ(J)
c
are found, with
µ(J)
c
≈0.86.
(16)
Notably, the Fermi level at the JT transition is outside
the normal-state TI gap [−0.5, 0.5], where the Dirac sur-
face physics is no longer valid.
Combining the above π-junction results and the crit-
icality relation in Sec. III D, we expect the µ-dependent
vortex topological phase diagram for the doped TI to fea-
ture two VLT critical points at ±µ(v)
c , within which there
should exist a topological nontrivial phase for the CdGM
states. This prediction holds for vortex lines parallel to
the (100) plane, e.g., the ones along ˆz. Since the system
respects C4 symmetry, the VLT phase can be either a
gapped Z2 Kitaev vortex phase or a gapless nodal vor-
tex phase, the distinction of which is beyond JVC. When
|µ| > µ(v)
c , we expect a trivial vortex phase.
As a confirmation, we carry out a large-scale vortex
simulation for the doped TI by regularizing the BdG
Hamiltonian on a 200 by 200 lattice with ∆0 = 0.03
and including an in-plane phase winding for the pairing
order. In Fig. 3 (c), we calculate the CdGM spectrum
at kz = 0 as a function of µ. The vortex line is further
found to be a Kitaev vortex phase with one MZM at each
end for |µ| < µ(v)
c
with µ(v)
c
= 0.9, which agrees well with
Ref. [32]. Remarkably, we find
µ(v)
c
= µ(J)
c
+ O(∆0).
(17)
directly following the criticality correspondence that we
have analytically constructed. In Fig. 3(d), we numeri-
cally track how µ(v)
c
and µ(J)
c
evolve as a function of ∆0.
We indeed find that both µ(v)
c
and µ(J)
c
will gradually
converge as we decrease ∆0, just as expected.

Superconducting Dirac semimetal
As a gapless cousin for class-AII TIs, the 3D Dirac
semimetals (DSM) is known for hosting symmetry-
protected four-fold band crossings [60, 61], whose low-
energy kinetics resemble that of a massless Dirac fermion.
The Abrikosov vortex line of a DSM, if respecting C4z,
is known to be a nodal phase [40, 41]. So what is the
corresponding JT for DSMs?
We start by noting that a minimal lattice model for
DSM is given by
hDSM(k) ≡hT I(k)|vz=0,
(18)
where the generator of C4z operation is updated to
Jz = γ34 + 1
2γ12. Keeping other parameters unchanged,
hDSM features a pair of C4-protected Dirac nodes at
K± = (0, 0, ± arccos(1/2)). Coupling the DSM with an
ˆx-directional pairing domain, it is easy to see that the
JT phase boundaries, i.e., where the Andreev spectrum
closes the gap at kz = 0 and π, are irrelevant to the value
of vz. So, the JT phase diagram of hDSM would be quan-
titatively the same as Fig. 3 (a), with critical chemical
potentials at µ ≈±0.86.
When µ is infinite, we always have a trivial JT. When µ
vanishes, a four-fold degenerate BdG Dirac node will ap-
pear as the massless domain-wall mode for each normal-
state Dirac fermion. Notably, Ref. [62] has also reported
such gapless Andreev bound states for a DSM-based π
junction.
However, we find that the nodal nature of
these Andreev bound states is, in fact, accidental and
lacks symmetry protection.
To see this, we consider a 2D effective theory to de-
scribe the nodal π-junction as
h(0)
eff (ky, kz) = vykyγ3 + [M0 −M1(k2
y + k2
z)]γ5,
(19)
where the BdG nodes live at (0, 0, ±
p
M0/M1) for
M0M1 > 0. Notably, we have adopted the definitions
of γ matrices in Eq. 15 to formulate the matrix algebra
of heff, while the physical meaning of Pauli matrices here
is fundamentally different from that in HT I or HDSM.
The important symmetries in the low-energy subspace
include the particle-hole symmetry Ξ = γ45K, the TRS
Θ = iγ13K, the inversion symmetry P = γ5. Crucially,
the π-junction geometry breaks the bulk symmetry C4z
down to a C2z = iγ23.
The odd-parity nature of the
junction is encoded in the anti-commutation relations
{Ξ, C2z} = {Ξ, P} = 0. We then find that the follow-
ing perturbation
h(1)
eff ∼kzγ4,
(20)
will gap out h(0)
eff while respecting Ξ, Θ, C2z, and P. We
highlight that heff = h(0)
eff + h(1)
eff is exactly a 2D class
DIII TSC in the continuum limit.
Since h(1)
eff is likely
small and pertubative in practice, we thus conclude that
π-junction of a weakly-doped DSM will generally host a
“quasi-nodal” Z2 JT with ν0 = 1.
