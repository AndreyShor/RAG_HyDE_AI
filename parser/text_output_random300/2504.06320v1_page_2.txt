LSTMs are adept at capturing temporal structures, their com-
plexity and resource-intensive nature do not align with our
sustainability goals, as they often result in models that are
computationally heavy and energy-intensive, and they are not
always applicable for edge applications.
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown
great promise in embedding physical laws directly into neu-
ral networks, improving generalization and interpretability in
physics-based applications [16], [17], [18]. However, applying
PINNs in complex systems like water distribution networks
is particularly challenging. These systems are governed by
numerous interdependent physical laws, and remodeling the
entire system to integrate these laws into the neural network
would require significant computational resources and exten-
sive domain expertise, making it impractical for real-world
applications [19], [20].
Recent work [1] has proposed a system-theoretic approach
inspired by classical embedding theory to analyze the di-
mensionality of a system’s latent representation. This method
introduces physics-inspired consistency principles, which ap-
proximate the causal mechanisms governing system dynamics
without explicitly enforcing physical laws. The underlying
idea is that complex systems in a stable regime exhibit
predictable behavior, allowing for well-approximated lower-
dimensional embeddings. In contrast, anomalies disrupt these
stable relationships, introducing additional complexity into the
system.
To incorporate temporal dynamics into the training process,
the proposed TDC-AE (Temporal Differential Consistency
Autoencoder) employs a Temporal Differential Consistency
(TDC) loss. This loss function enforces consistency between
the approximated time derivative of static latent variables
and the corresponding dynamic latent variables, improving
the model’s ability to detect deviations from normal behav-
ior. By integrating lightweight physics-inspired constraints,
this method provides an efficient alternative to traditional
physics-informed approaches, making it well-suited for real-
time anomaly detection in CPS with constrained computational
resources.
Finally, sustainability is a critical consideration in designing
machine learning models in CPS. Training and deploying these
models often demand significant computational resources,
leading to higher energy consumption and carbon emissions.
As infrastructure systems like water distribution increasingly
prioritize sustainability, conventional methods, while effective
in terms of detection performance, often overlook energy
efficiency. This makes them unsuitable for real-time, large-
scale applications where minimizing energy use is essential.
This challenge of sustainability was addressed in previous
research [21], where edge computing was leveraged to achieve
substantial gains in energy efficiency for anomaly detection
systems. Building on this, we now focus on refining the
internal architecture of the model to further enhance detection
performance and maximize energy efficiency.
III. METHODOLOGY
Our approach builds upon two key ideas: the benefits of
edge computing for anomaly detection [21] and the temporal
differential consistency (TDC) loss framework [1]. While
these approaches provide strong foundations, they also present
limitations. Edge computing alone does not inherently address
the challenge of finding an embedding that accurately captures
the system dynamics. While TDC aims to enforce meaningful
relationships between static and dynamic states in complex
dynamical systems, we hypothesize that a diverse range of sys-
tems may require a more refined representation that accounts
for both deterministic and non-deterministic components.
To address the challenge of distinguishing between deter-
ministic and non-deterministic contributions to system dy-
namics, we propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach,
hybrid TDC-AE, where the latent space is structured into
statistical and deterministic nodes. The deterministic nodes
are designed to capture aspects of the system that can be
described by physical principles, such as differential equations
and conservation laws, while statistical nodes account for
residual variability and unmodeled effects. We aim to guide
the autoencoder toward a latent representation that aligns with
the underlying causal structure of the system.
A. Dataset
The evaluation is conducted using the publicly available
BATADAL dataset, which stands for BATtle of the Attack De-
tection ALgorithms [22]. This dataset was developed as part of
a challenge aimed at comparing the performance of algorithms
designed to detect cyber-attacks in water supply systems. It
represents the C-Town water distribution system, modeled
after a real-world, medium-sized network. The system includes
429 pipes, 388 junctions, 7 storage tanks (T1 −T7), 11
pumps (PU1 −PU11) distributed across 5 pumping stations,
5 valves (V 1−V 4), a single reservoir, and nine Programmable
Logic Controllers (PLCs). The dataset contains 43 numerical
metrics recorded on an hourly basis, with each feature vector
representing one hour and consisting of 43 features. These
features are readings from the SCADA system, including 7
features representing tank water levels, 12 features related
to inlet and outlet pressures for an actuated valve and all
pumping stations, and 24 features representing their flow rates
and operational status.
We adopt the dataset split from this study [1], where
the BATADAL dataset is divided into three segments, each
representing a distinct edge area within the water distribu-
tion network. This segmentation is based on the network’s
topology, ensuring that the data for each model is closely
aligned with the physical layout and operational relevance of
the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) situated in these
areas. Tab. I presents the features used for each segment,
illustrating how the dataset has been tailored to reflect the
operational structure of the system.
