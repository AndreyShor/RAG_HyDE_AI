During this phase, the perturbations that enter the horizon collapse into PBH, as shown
in the next section. However, the quantity we use to compute the abundance of PBH,
i.e., the mass fraction β(k), is not the power spectrum of curvature perturbations, but the
variance of the density perturbations, σk. For modes that enter the horizon after inflation,
the curvature perturbations are related to the density perturbations δϕ,k as follows 1[60, 74]
δϕ,k ≃8
5Rk,
(2.6)
where a suffix “k” means Fourier component and k is the modulus of the wavenumber
vector k. Also, a suffix “ϕ” is introduced as a notation so that these fluctuations are not
confused with the energy density fluctuation of the PBH, which is defined below. Eqn. (2.6)
implies that the power spectrum of the density perturbations should be written as
Pδϕ(k) ≃64
25PR(k),
(2.7)
and we can approximate the variance as follows
σk ≃

Pδϕ(k).

As explained in the introduction, to terminate the preheating stage and recover the
usual reheating scenario, the inflation field must decay into radiation via a decay rate Γϕ,
which occurs at a time tr = Γ−1
ϕ . At this point, the time evolution of the temperature of
the radiation fluid is given by [15, 16, 75]

in units of Planck mass (1Mpl = 1.22 × 1019GeV). In this equation, ar = a(tr) and g∗(T)
is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom, which takes the value g∗= 106.75 for
T ≳100GeV (assuming the Standard Model is valid at those energies, see Refs. [76, 77] for
a review of the dependence of the effective degrees of freedom with temperature). However,
if after the decay the abundance of PBH is high enough, they will dominate due to the
different redshifts of the energy densities of radiation and PBH, a−4 and a−3, respectively.
In this case, since radiation becomes a subdominant component, the reheating occurs at
a later stage and through the evaporation of PBH due to Hawking radiation [59], with an
associated temperature given by (see eqn. (2.24) of [65])

1In this work, since our focus is only on the scales that are amplified during inflation, we do not consider
the subhorizon modes that never exit the horizon during inflation. Although they could contribute to PBH
formation, as shown in [27, 28], their contribution is only toward very small scales in contrast to what we
explore in this work.
