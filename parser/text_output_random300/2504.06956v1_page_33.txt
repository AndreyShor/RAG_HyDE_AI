we have that k â‰ˆec

L. As usual, we can assume that we are on the event {Kb < k}, otherwise the
conclusion follows trivially by Lemma 4.10. In particular, on the event {Kb < k}, by Lemma 4.9 (see
also (4.13)), it suffices to estimate the probability of the following event

j=1
{Bj â‰¥âˆ’Î» âˆ’Rk(j)},

To this end, we start by noticing that thanks to Lemma A.11, there exists a constant c > 0 such that,
P0,u,b

Hence, we can now assume that we are on the complement of the giant union appearing in the
probability on the left-hand side of the above display, i.e., we need to estimate the probability of the
following event
bâˆ’1
\
j=1
{Bj â‰¥âˆ’Î» âˆ’Rk(j)},
bâˆ’1

{Bj > Î» + Rk(j)},

(4.48)
For each j âˆˆ[b âˆ’1]0, we introduce the process (W j
s )sâˆˆ[j,j+1] given by
W j
s
def= ((j + 1) âˆ’s)Bj + (s âˆ’j)Bj+1 âˆ’Bs ,
âˆ€s âˆˆ[j, j + 1] .
The process W j has the law of standard Brownian bridge indexed by times in the interval [j, j + 1].
Moreover, the collection (W j)jâˆˆ[bâˆ’1]0 is independent of the values (Bj)jâˆˆ[b]0. Now, we note that by
definition of k, for all j âˆˆ[k]0, it holds that Î» + Rk(j) â‰¤L/2. In particular, this fact implies that, on
the first event, the last two events in (4.48) are contained in the following union of events

(4.49)
For the first event in (4.49), using the independence of the collection (W j)jâˆˆ[bâˆ’1]0 from the values
(Bj)jâˆˆ[b]0, the Gaussian tails of the supremum of a standard Brownian bridge, arguing as in the proof
Lemma 4.10, there exists a constant c > 0 such that

Finally, regarding the second event in (4.49), using again the independence mentioned above, and the
Gaussian tails of the supremum of a standard Brownian bridge, we have that thanks to Lemma 4.10,
there exists a constant c > 0 such that

Therefore, by combining all the bounds we have established so far, the claim follows.
We now state and prove the following results which provides a decay of the field Î¥b,g on the event that
the supremum of such a field is bounded by one.
