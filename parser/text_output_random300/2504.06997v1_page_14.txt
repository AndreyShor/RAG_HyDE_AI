variation for fitting and DL models. The error bars represent the 25th and 75th percentiles of the recovered data. 
3.5 Cerebral perfusion monitoring before and after lunch on a healthy adult 
In this section, we first evaluated the recovered cerebral perfusion waveform using the proposed 
DL model under the resting-state (baseline condition, 30 minutes before lunch) in a healthy adult 
male. Fig. 10 presents the DL-recovered and fitting-recovered cerebral perfusion waveforms at the 
baseline, with a smoothing function applied for visualization in MATLAB (default method: 
moving average, span=ceil(0.1√ólength(ùë•ùë•))). We calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient 
between the two recovered waveform series (R = 0.974), which demonstrates that our model 
closely matches the waveform recovered by the traditional curve-fitting method. Additionally, we 
observed that the amplitude of the DL-recovered waveform is larger than that obtained by single-
exponential fitting. This observation aligns with our simulation findings and suggests that the DL-
recovered waveform is closer to the true perfusion changes. Furthermore, our model amplifies 
small peaks at relatively low cerebral perfusion levels more effectively than the fitting method. 
Based on our sensitivity analysis, we surmise that the DL model is capturing subtle perfusion 
fluctuations that fitting might smooth out.
