In the calculation of GJ, only the j, j′ = J −1, J −1
block of ΣL and the j, j′ = J + 2, J + 2 block of ΣR are
non-zero. They are explicitly,

Here, GL
J−2,J−2 and GR
J+3,J+3 are the 2×2 surface blocks
of the Green’s function for the rhombohedral half-crystals
on the left and right. We derive an analytic expression
for GL from a modified Eqn. 2,

To obtain GR we interchange the diagonal elements of
GL, and then transpose if the stacking is inverted at the
junction.

Dimensional extension of junction Hamiltonians
The “bulk” Hamiltonians for the junction regions take
a form,
Hk =

The coupling blocks VJ,J+1(k) now depend on the out-
of-plane wave vector k and can be obtained from the
coupling blocks listed earlier by replacing γ1 →γ1eikc
(γ1 →γ1e−ikc), with c = 3.35 ˚A the interlayer distance
[30], in each matrix element for which the initial state is
coupled to a neighbour to the left (right). See Supple-
mentary Note 4 for diagrams showing the effective one-
dimensional periodicity for each junction.

Modelling a sliding junction
To model a sliding junction, we allow all sites to cou-
ple to sites in the neighbouring layers and introduce dis-
tance dependence into the interlayer coupling. This ef-
fectively introduces interlayer couplings γ3 and γ4 from
the Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure model of graphite; how-
ever, our assumption that the interlayer hopping depends
only the distance between sites means we do not distin-
guish explicitly between these two couplings. We adopt a
Slater-Koster scheme [48] in which a hopping between a
pz orbital on the atomic site µ on layer J and a pz orbital
on the site µ′ on layer J + 1 and distance d away is,
γµ,µ′ = Vppσ(dµ,µ′) cos2(θµ,µ′),
(11)
where Vppσ(dµ,µ′) is the distance-dependent sigma bond
integral, and θµµ′ is the angle between the out-of-plane
direction and the in-plane vector connecting the sites µ
and µ′. Note that we neglect the contribution from the pi
bond integral Vppπ as the distances involved are compa-
rable to next-nearest in-plane neighbour distances, and
we do not include the corresponding in-plane couplings
in our description. An interlayer matrix element of the
Hamiltonian includes a sum over all sites of the same
type for which Vppσ(d) > 0, with each term weighted
by an appropriate phase factor. Further details of the
model are given in Supplementary Note 5. Note that, for
consistency, we also include the skew interlayer hopping
between layers across the rhombohedral half-crystals (in
this case, only d =

is relevant). Due to
the increased number of non-zero terms in the respective
Hamiltonians, ΣL and ΣR are now obtained numerically
by decimation [49].
