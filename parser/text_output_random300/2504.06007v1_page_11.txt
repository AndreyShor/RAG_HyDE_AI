Figure 6: Composite difference in DJF precipitation (mm/day) during ENSO events (El Niño minus La Niña) for
the eight strongest ENSO years on record, as identified by the Niño3.4 index. Results are shown for CAM6 (left) and
CAMulator (right), with composites constructed using simple averaging. The Niño3.4-based El Niño years (December)
include 1979, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1991, 1994, 1997, and 2002, while La Niña years (December) include 1983, 1984,
1988, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2007. The color scale represents precipitation anomalies, where red indicates
increased precipitation during El Niño relative to La Niña, and blue indicates reduced precipitation.
Figure 7: Climatology of the annual maximum 6-hourly average two-meter temperature (TREFHT, left column) and
precipitation rate (PRECT, right column) over the period 1979–2014. The top row shows results from CAMulator, while
the middle row presents results from CAM. The bottom row displays the differences (CAMulator - CAM), highlighting
areas where CAMulator simulates warmer or colder extreme temperatures (red and blue shading, respectively) and
higher or lower extreme precipitation rates (green and blue shading, respectively). Color bars indicate absolute values for
TREFHT (K) and precipitation (mm/day) in the top and middle rows, while the bottom row represents their respective
differences.
