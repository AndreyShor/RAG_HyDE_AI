The transition b

3 →(X3, [±1]3)
Using again the techniques from [2, 3, 63] we obtain the
fundamental period of the mirror of b
Xr
3, which takes the form

We denote the three single-logarithmic periods by
̟1,i = ̟0 log zi + O(z, v) ,
i = 1, 2, 3 ,
(5.39)
and observe that they satisfy
̟1,1/̟0 = log z1 + 2z2

In the limit v →0, the complexiﬁed volume of a curve of degree (d1, d2, 0) is therefore given
by (d1 + d2)te(z). This means that the exceptional curve Cp that resolves a node p ∈Xr has
complexiﬁed volume
VolC(Cp) =

where Sr,Ai and Sr,Bj respectively denote the subsets of nodes of Type Ai and Bj in Xr
3.
In order to perform the conifold transition from b
Xr
3 to X3 we want to smoothen the nodes
of Type B and therefore need to take a limit where 3te(z) ∈Z. The two relevant limits are
therefore
lim
z→1/4 te(z) = 0 ,
lim
z→1 te(z) = −1
3 .
(5.44)
In the ﬁrst limit, z →1/4, we observe that te(z) →0. Therefore the complexiﬁed volume
of all of the exceptional curves is zero and we can deform away all of the nodes in Xr
3, leading
to a conifold transition from b
Xr
3 to the generic smooth octic e
X3 ⊂P4
1,1,1,1,4. At the level of
the fundamental period, this corresponds to the regularized limit
