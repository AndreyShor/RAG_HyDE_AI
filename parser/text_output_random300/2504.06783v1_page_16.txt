Methods 
Coupled data assimilation systems 
Two coupled models. The CESM [32] and CM2 [33] employed the historical simulation period from 1945 
to 2006 and the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP45) scenario period from 2007 to the present. 
For CESM, the atmospheric component (Community Atmosphere Model version 5, CAM5) employed a 
spectral-element dynamic core (“ne30g16” configuration) with approximately 1° × 1° horizontal resolution 
near the equator, and 26 vertical levels; the oceanic component (Parallel Ocean Program version 2, POP2) is 
configured with a horizontal resolution of approximately 1° × 1° and 60 vertical levels, with 15 levels of 10-
m thickness in the upper 150 m. For CM2, the atmospheric component (Atmosphere Model version 2.1, AM2.1) 
employed a finite-volume dynamic core with a horizontal resolution of 2° latitude × 2.5° longitude and 24 
vertical levels; the oceanic component (Modular Ocean Model version 4, MOM4) is configured with 50 
vertical levels (22 of which are 10-m thick in the upper 220 m) and a 1° × 1° horizontal B-grid resolution, 
telescoping to 1/3° meridional spacing near the equator. 
Multiscale data assimilation algorithm. A multi-timescale, high-efficiency approximate Ensemble 
Kalman Filter [28], combined with a deep-ocean bias relaxation scheme [10], is implemented into both models 
to establish two CDA systems. This CDA algorithm uses the single-model state time series to construct 
stationary, low-frequency, and high-frequency filters, markedly reducing the consumption of computational 
resources [29,30]. The algorithm consists of the following two steps:
