Figure 4: Velocity profiles predicted by (3.5) as the torus aspect ratio, 𝜖, and leading-order
term vary. Note how when 𝑓(𝑡) and 𝜅Δ𝑝/(2𝜋) cancel each other, the asymmetric flow
dominates. Moreover, the symmetry breaking becomes observable earlier for larger values
of 𝜖, though we reiterate that our theory is formally valid only for 𝜖≪1.

We can get a first hint of the symmetry breaking mechanism observed in Figure 3 by
considering when the asymmetric correction term 𝜖𝑤1 is of a similar size as the symmetric
leading order solution 𝑤0. Indeed, it is easy to verify that this will be the case when the
pressure gradient approximately cancels out the forcing 𝑓(𝑡), such that the modulating
coefficient 𝑓(𝑡) + 𝜅𝜕𝑝0
𝜕𝑠in (3.5a) is close to zero. This is visualized in Figure 4, where we plot
the velocity 𝑤= 𝑤0 + 𝜖𝑤1 for several values of 𝜖and 𝑓(𝑡) + 𝜅𝜕𝑝0

profile when 𝑓(𝑡) + 𝜅𝜕𝑝0

From the velocities (3.5), we may compute the flux, noting that the asymmetric components
of 𝑤1(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) integrate to zero because of the cos 𝜃term:

Since the flux 𝑄= 𝑄0 + 𝜖𝑄1 + ... is independent of 𝑠, we can now integrate the above
