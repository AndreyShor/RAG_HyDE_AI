and sensory factors of grasping and further studies would serve
to deepen our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms at work
here. With further studies, we may begin to look at generalisable,
biomechanical models of grasping that reveal much deeper insights
into perceptual thresholds and object selection.

Conclusion
Previous studies have estimated perception thresholds of a single
factor in grasping. In this paper, we proposed a model of illusion
space of size and angle perception in VR. Instead of single-factor
threshold estimation, we explored the interplay among four factors:
physical sizes, physical angles, virtual sizes and virtual angles with
the model. We conducted 2AFC experiments with multiple combina-
tions and summarised the pattern of the results with mathematical
expressions and figure illustrations. We reveal a multi-dimensional
illusion space for both size and taper angle.
The physical sizes and taper angles have obvious influences on
the perception. When physical objects are small, they can represent
a greater variety of virtual object sizes in VR. A more tilted physical
taper angle allows these objects to mimic a broader spectrum of
virtual sizes and angles. In addition to physical characteristics, we
found that increasing virtual object size substantially enlarges the
perceived angle and expands the range of angles a physical object
can simulate. On the other hand, increasing the virtual angle leads
to a smaller perception of size, illustrating a strong interaction
between size and angle in VR-induced illusions.
We introduce a function that better captures a physical object’s
haptic potential, highlighting how size and taper angle work to-
gether to create illusions. Moreover, we explore how these insights
could be applied to the design of haptic systems, advancing the
development of high-resolution haptic devices. We provide a model
that allows for the prediction of perception thresholds. Our find-
ings broaden our understanding of how to design for detailed and
accurate haptic feedback in VR.
