(3) If G has two oriented external half-edges and one non-oriented external half-edge, the reduction
has the form RG(N)i
a,b = rG(N)T i
ab. We construct the vacuum graph G0 by joining all external
half edges in a fundamental vertex, i.e. we multiply by T i
ba and sum over i, a, and b. Because

(4) If G has three non-oriented external half-edges, the reduction has two terms corresponding to two
triangles with opposite orientation,

We close in two different ways by contraction with T i

fd and with T k

efT i
fd, yielding the
vacuum graphs G1
0 and G2
0, respectively. The transition matrix is given by two oriented triangles
that are connected by three non-oriented edges. The orientation of the triangles can be parallel
or opposite, yielding the symmetric 2 × 2 matrix (see the last two graphs in Figure 6)
