to the reconstruction of the solar thermal structure. Here, we use the following parametrization
of the chemical proﬁles to that end
X(r)

X0(rSup) +

α3X0(0) −X0(rSup)

(α3X0(0) −X0(rSup))

with the free parameters αi. For sufﬁciently small variations of the free parameters, this ap-
proach preserves the properties of chemical composition gradients and ensures that X+Y+Z = 1
as well as a continuous connection at rS up (here 0.3R⊙). X0(r) and Y0(r) denote the hydrogen
and helium mass fraction proﬁles of the evolutionary model. The parameters will take values
close to 1, with multiple solutions being possible. Usually, α1 will be about 0.98, α2 about 1,
and α3 and α4 only vary by about 0.006.
The parametrization proposed in equations 9-11 is not unique and similar reconstruction tech-
niques applied to other evolutionary stages or masses would require modiﬁcations. Such meth-
ods could in principle be applied to other types of pulsators, provided that the inversion tech-
nique is adapted to handle the lower number of oscillation modes. The parametrizations of
regions where the mean molecular weight gradient dominates the Ledoux discriminant proﬁle
would then be highly informative on the transport of chemicals.
Tests on solar model proﬁles have demonstrated its effectiveness in replicating trends observed
in evolutionary computations, as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1. Notably, recent work by
Kunitomo & Guillot95 has suggested that considering the solar system’s formation could lead
to a local increase in the solar core’s metallicity. Such considerations should be integrated
into upcoming seismic solar models. Kunitomo & Guillot95 also conﬁrmed the necessity for
increased opacity to enhance agreement between solar models and helioseismic results, even
