Bubbling off
Figure S8: The 𝐽-oscillator on [U-13C, 15N]-butyronitrile. The data were acquired with 𝐺ext =
−2000 and 𝜏= 150 ms. (A) A 20-min acquisition produces a DC maser signal (no oscillations are
resolvable within the acquisition window). (B) The signal acquired under the same conditions, but
with para-H2 bubbling stopped at around 700 s (marked as the dashed line). The signal disappears
upon stopping the bubbling, confirming that its origin relates to sample hyperpolarization and
feedback.
