The above transformation is not a covariant one since, in general:
Xaλ(X)ϕ ̸= λ(X)Xaϕ .
(93)
Drawing ideas from the methodology of ordinary gauge theories, in which covariant derivative
is defined for similar reasons, in the noncommutative case, the covariant coordinate, ϕα, is
introduced by its transformation rule:
δ(ϕaϕ) = λϕaϕ ,
(94)
which is satisfied in case
δ(ϕa) = [λ, ϕa] .
(95)
Eventually, the covariant coordinate is defined as:
ϕa ≡Xa + Aa ,
(96)
where it is straightforward to identify Aα as the gauge connection of the theory. Putting
together equations (94) and (95), the gauge transformation of the connection, Aα, is obtained:
δAa = −[Xa, λ] + [λ, Aa] ,
(97)
giving an a posteriori explanation of the interpretation of Aa as a gauge field (for more details,
see [76]). Accordingly, the corresponding field strength tensor, Fab , is defined as follows:
Fab ≡[Xa, Ab] −[Xb, Aa] + [Aa, Ab] −Cab
cAc = [ϕa, ϕb] −Cab
cϕc,
(98)
which is easily proven to be covariant under a gauge transformation,
δFab = [λ, Fab].
(99)
The above scheme will be used in the following sections in the construction of gravity model
as gauge theory on fuzzy covariant space.

The Background Space
The next step we need to take before we move on with the gauge theory of FG, is to establish
the background space, on which this theory will be formulated. In refs [39, 41, 42, 77, 78]
extending the original Snyder’s suggestion [79] the authors have considered the group the
SO(1, 5) and have assigned the 4-d spacetime coordinates to elements of its Lie algebra.
More specifically starting with the group SO(1, 5), whose generators obey the following
Lie algebra:
[Jmn, Jrs] = i (ηmrJns + ηnsJmr −ηnrJms −ηmsJnr) ,
(100)
where m, n, r, r = 0, . . . , 5, and ηmn = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1). Performing the decompositions of
SO(1, 5) to its maximal subgroups, up to SO(1, 3), i.e., SO(1, 5) ⊃SO(1, 4) and SO(1, 4) ⊃
