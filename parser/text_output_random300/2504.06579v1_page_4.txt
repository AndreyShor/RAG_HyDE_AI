are working in the Schrödinger picture in which states and density operators evolve in
time, as opposed to the Heisenberg approach in which states and density operators are time
independent, while operators standing for dynamical variables are time dependent and follow
evolution according to the so-called quantum Langevin equation [23]. Considering Laplace
transform of both sides of Eq. (4), one obtains in the Laplace space the equation [20]
eρ(s) = eU(s)ρ(0),

with s being the Laplace variable,

and I being the identity operator.
As a specific example of a dynamics described by Eq. (6), which has the structure
emerging in a stochastic Liouville equation set-up [18,24], let us take the static Hamiltonian
H0 to represent a two-state problem – in particular a spin-half system – in the presence of a
magnetic field of strength B0 along the z-axis and a magnetic field of strength B along the
transverse x-axis. Thus, we have
H0 = −B0σz −Bσx,

where the σ’s are the Pauli matrices. Denoting the eigenstates of σz by |1⟩and |2⟩and
assuming that the spin is prepared in state |1⟩at time t = 0, so that the initial density matrix
is ρ(0) = |1⟩⟨1|, the probability of finding the spin in state |2⟩at time t is [25]

The oscillatory behavior encapsulated in the above equation, which is directly linked with
quantum coherence, is characteristic of the Rabi formula that is a generic feature of molecular
beams, masers, and so forth [25]. The central aim of our present study is to investigate how,
given that initially the system was in state |1⟩, the stay-put probability P1(t)(= 1 −P2(t)) is
affected because of decoherence induced by a neighboring state through which a stochastic
drive is triggered. In other words, in the set-up of Eq. (2), the system is subject to pulses at
Poisson-distributed random times that induce transitions between the upper state |2⟩and the
neighboring state. The presence of the neighboring state, the third level |3⟩, replenishing the
upper level is reminiscent of how a laser works. Normally, in a laser, the upper level undergoes
a ‘population inversion’ because of stimulation provided by a third level. In our scenario,
however, we are dealing with a quantum system at zero temperature, wherein population
inversion has no relevance. Furthermore, unlike the typical case in lasers where the third level
coherently pumps the upper level, in our setup, the third level acts as a source of quantum
dissipation. Specifically, coupling to the third level via applied pulses induces non-unitary
evolution in the system that would otherwise evolve unitarily.
Let us state our main results at the outset. In this work, we derive in the Laplace domain
an exact analytical expression for the stay-put probability P1(t), Eq. (31).
