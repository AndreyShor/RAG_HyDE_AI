also obtained in [HrT23, Lem. 4.4] by a slightly diﬀerent and more generally applicable argument
that only uses that σN is uniformly bounded in L∞(0, T; L1(Td)).
Having established the spatial regularity of ˜ρN in Lemma 5.3 as well as boundedness of the
ﬂuxes in Proposition 5.5, our next step is to show time regularity for ˜ρN.
Lemma 5.7 (Time regularity). Assume (4.A1) and let (cN, F N, JN) satisfy the a priori esti-
mates (5.1). Then, we have the uniform bound supN∈N∥˜ρN∥BV (0,T;(W 1,∞(X))∗) < ∞.
Proof. We ﬁrst focus on the more complicated interpolation ˜ιN and recall (3.13), which implies
for every ϕ ∈C1(X)

Similarly, for every ϕ ∈C(X) we have

With this, we consider any partition (tm)M
m=0, M ∈N of [0, T]. Then, the previous bounds, the
discrete continuity equation, and Proposition 5.5 yield, for every ϕ ∈C1(X), the estimate

Taking suprema with respect to ϕ ∈{ϕ ∈C1(X): ∥ϕ∥W1,∞(X) ≤1} and the partition, we obtain
supN∥˜ρN∥BV(0,T;(W1,∞)∗) < ∞. This ﬁnishes the proof of Lemma 5.7.
Combining the spatial regularity of ˜u from Lemma 5.3 and the time regularity of ˜ρ from
Lemma 5.7, we are now able to apply the Aubin-Lions-Simon lemma to obtain strong L1
compactness for ˜ρN. We then show that ρN has the same strong limit by comparing it to ˜ρN.
