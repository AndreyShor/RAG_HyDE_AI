Supplementary Note 1. 
In the literature, there were found some variations in details of the band structure for 
ABCB/ABAC stackings. Mostly, the differences are explained by differences in 
theoretical or computational methods, e.g., a tight-binding model or DFT based 
calculations. However, already within the DFT, there is subtlety about convergence 
with respect to the momentum space k-mesh sampling. In practice, 𝑁𝑁× 𝑁𝑁 in plane 
regular grids are used in the calculations. Note that the regular grids can be placed with 
half-grid shift to avoid the exact Γ-point or without such shift to include the exact Γ-
point. Fig. S21 shows that the convergence is particularly slow without the half-grid 
shift, and the band structures look a little different for small k-sampling numbers (e.g., 
extra band crossing at the conduction band side).

Fig. S5. Partial Löwdin charge for each layer in ABAC and ABCB stackings. a, 
Calculated partial Löwdin charge for each carbon atom. Considering ABAB case as a 
reference (black dots and dotted line), there are fewer electrons in L1 and L2 and more 
electrons in L3 and L4 in ABCB stacking, while there are more electrons in L1 and L2 
and fewer electrons in L3 and L4 in ABAC stacking. For both polar stackings, charge 
imbalance, in comparison to that of ABAB, is greater in L2 and L3 than in L1 and L4.
