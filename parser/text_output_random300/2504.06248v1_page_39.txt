Lemma S10 (Time evolution of peripheral oscillators in the frame of their source is a symmetry).
If there is a source oscillator with natural frequency ωs and it has outgoing edges toward r > 1 disjoint subgraphs
whose vertex sets are denoted by W1, ..., Wr, then the Koopman generators of the subgraphs in the rotating frame of
the source,
Sη = Kη −iωsLη
0 ,
η ∈{1, ..., r} ,
(S95)
are generators of Lie symmetries, where Kη = P
j∈Wη
P
k∈V(Ajkzk −¯Ajk¯zkz2
j )∂j with V = {s} ∪W1 ∪... ∪Wr and
Lη
0 = P
j∈Wη zj∂j.
Proof. The existence of a source connected to disjoint subsets implies that the Koopman generator splits as
K = Ks +
r
X
τ=1
Kτ = iωszs∂s +
r
X
τ=1
X
j∈Wτ
X
k∈V
(Ajkzk −¯Ajk¯zkz2
j )∂j .

Lemma S8, stated in z-coordinates on the N-torus, implies that satisfying the commutation relations [K, Sη] = 0 for
all η is a sufficient condition for the present lemma to hold. Now, as illustrated in Fig. S5, each subgraph W1, . . . , Wr
has a certain fraction of vertices contained in R1, . . . , Rr that receive from the source. The generator of the source
Ks only acts on the phase of these oscillators and it is convenient to split the generators related to the subgraphs as
Kτ = KRτ + KWτ ,
τ ∈{1, ..., r} ,
where KRτ = P
j∈Rτ (Ajszs −¯Ajs¯zsz2
j )∂j and KWτ = P
j,k∈Wτ (Ajkzk −¯Ajk¯zkz2
j )∂j. Hence,
[K, Sη] = [ iωszs∂s + Pr
τ=1(KRτ + KWτ ) , KRη + KWη −iωsLη
0 ] .
Using bilinearity and keeping only the nontrivial commutators yields
[K, Sη] = iωs[zs∂s, KRη] −iωs[KRη + KWη, Lη
0] .
But clearly, one also finds [KWη, Lη
0] = 0 with the commutation relations of Lem. S9 (or the intuition that Lη
0 is the
dilatation symmetry generator for Wη and thus commutes with KWη) and [KRη, Lη
0] = P
k∈Rη[KRη, zk∂k]. Hence,
[K, Sη] = iωs( P
j∈Rη[zs∂s , (Ajszs −¯Ajs¯zsz2
j )∂j] −P
j,k∈Rη[(Ajszs −¯Ajs¯zsz2
j )∂j, zk∂k] ) .
On the one hand, the first term is
X
j∈Rη
[zs∂s , (Ajszs −¯Ajs¯zsz2
j )∂j] =
X
j∈Rη
(Ajszs + ¯Ajs¯zsz2
j )∂j .
On the other hand, the commutation relation [ ℓm
j , ℓn
k ] = δjk(n −m) ℓm+n
j
of Lem. S9 implies that the second term is
X
j,k∈Rη
[(Ajszs −¯Ajs¯zsz2
j )∂j, zk∂k] =
X
j,k∈Rη
(Ajszs[ℓ−1
j , ℓ0
k] −¯Ajs¯zs[ℓ1
j, ℓ0
k]) =
X
j∈Rη
(Ajszs + ¯Ajs¯zsz2
j )∂j .
Consequently, [K, Sη] = 0 for all η ∈{1, ..., r}, so each Sη is indeed a Lie symmetry generator of the Kuramoto
dynamics.
Remark S28. For r = 1, the symmetry generator is S = K −iωsL0 and hence, S is linearly dependent on K and L0.
This means that the symmetry generator does not enable the creation of a new constant of motion in the way we do
in Thm. 3 of the main text.
In the next theorem, we use the possible coexistence of the symmetry generators in the last lemma and the conserved
cross-ratios (Thm. S12) to generate new functionally independent constants of motion.
Theorem S29 (Thm. 3 of the paper). Consider that the Kuramoto model in Def. (S1) has a symmetry generator Sη
as defined in Eq. (S95) related to the subgraph Wη and the source oscillator s.
