Fig. S1. Comparison of QUBO matrices for real-world optimization and Max-Cut problems. 
(a–c) QUBO matrices representing the optimization of planar multilayered structures (PMLs) with 
problem sizes of (a) 100, (b) 500, and (c) 3,000. The dense configurations of these matrices reflect 
the fully connected nature of interactions in material optimization problems. (d–f) QUBO matrices 
derived from Max-Cut problem instances in the G-setS1: (d) G5, (e) G15, and (f) G40. These 
matrices exhibit sparse configurations, with relatively few pairwise interactions compared to their 
maximum possible connections. 
 
 
 
 
Fig. S2. Example QUBO matrices. The size of the given QUBO problems is (a) 120 and (b) 
1,000 with a standard deviation of 0.1.
