FIG. 1. Reconstructed shape functions Si (i = 0, 1, 2) derived from multiple cosmic-distance measurements, displayed as a
function of redshift z. Each column corresponds to a different dataset: DESI BAO Data Release 1 (leftmost), DESI BAO Data
Release 2, PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5, (rightmost). From top to bottom, the panels show S0(z), S1(z), and S2(z), as
defined in Eqs. (4), which capture the time evolution of the energy density of dark energy, the pressure of dark energy, and
the equation of state of dark energy, respectively. In each panel, the solid white line indicates the best-fit reconstruction, while
the blue shaded region denotes the 68% confidence-level uncertainty, derived according to Eqs. (1)–(4). The green dash-dotted
curve represents the best-fit shape function from the CPL parameterization, and the horizontal dashed line is the corresponding
prediction of the ΛCDM model. See texts for further details.
at higher redshifts. Even so, the alignment between
DESI DR2 and SNe data underscores the importance of
forthcoming high-precision measurements for clarifying
the fundamental nature and potential evolution of dark
energy.

EVOLUTION OF THE EQUATION OF
STATE
To explore this further, we adopt the commonly used
w0–wa parameterization [54, 55], in which the dark en-
ergy equation of state is written as w(a) = w0 + wa (1 −
a). Here, w0 is the present-day equation-of-state value,
while wa describes how w evolves with redshift. Notably,
ΛCDM is recovered by setting w0 = −1 and wa = 0.
Fitting this model to the data constrains the possible
dynamical nature of dark energy in a simple yet effec-
tive manner. Moreover, the w0–wa approach serves as a
bridge between the shape-function reconstructions and
the fully non-parametric w(z) methods discussed later,
offering an intermediate step toward more general dark
energy modeling.
Our analysis draws upon three categories of measure-
ments: BAO observations from DESI DR1 and DR2
[37, 38], SNe samples from PantheonPlus, Union3, and
the 5-year DES survey (DESY5), and distance con-
straints from the CMB. Because dark energy chiefly af-
fects the Universe’s background expansion history, and
modeling its perturbations requires additional assump-
tions, we focus here on background observables. Specifi-
cally, we incorporate the DESI DR1/DR2 BAO measure-
ments, SNe luminosity distances, and the Big Bang Nu-
cleosynthesis (BBN) prior Ωbh2 = 0.02196±0.00063 [56].
We also include CMB distance information from Planck
PR4 [57], imposing 100 θ∗= 1.04098 ± 0.00042, where
θ∗≡r∗/DM(z∗) is the ratio of the comoving sound hori-
zon at recombination r∗to the transverse comoving dis-
tance DM(z∗) [21, 39]. The quantity r∗is computed using
RECFAST [58] within CAMB [59].3 As in [60], we inflate the
error bar from [57] (column ‘PR4 12.6’ TTTEEE in Ta-
