and so the claim follows from the dominated convergence theorem and the monotone convergence
theorem.
We are now ready to prove Proposition 2.11.
Proof of Proposition 2.11. Let λ ∈Λ and F ∈Cb
loc(C(Rd)). By applying the characterisation (2.8) of
the field Ψλ to the right-hand side of (2.10), we obtain that the claim follows if one can prove that the
following equality holds

We note that this is precisely (2.9), and thus the claim is established by Proposition 2.9.

Independence from the choice of threshold
In this section, we verify the independence of certain quantities of interest from the arbitrary threshold
λ. Specifically, we begin by proving Proposition 2.13, which establishes the independence of the law
of the field Ψλ from λ ∈Λ. Then, in Lemma 5.8, we show that the constant a⋆, defined in (2.11), is
also independent from λ ∈Λ.
We start by proving Proposition 2.13.
Proof of Proposition 2.13. Consider λ1, λ2 ∈Λ such that λ2 < λ1. Thanks to Lemma 5.1, we know
that the field eΥλ2 has the same law as the field eΥλ1, conditioned on the event M(eΥλ1) ≤λ2. Therefore,
for any F ∈Cb
loc(C(Rd)), recalling Definition 2.7, we can write
E[F(Ψλ2)] ∝E

(5.9)
where x⋆∈Rd denotes the point where the field eΥλ1 achieves its maximum. Now, one would like to
apply the resampling property (2.9) of the field eΥλ1 to the quantity on the right-hand side. However,
we observe that the function that assigns to eΥλ1 the quantity inside the expectation in (5.9) is not
a function in Cb
loc(C(Rd)). Indeed, this map is neither bounded nor dependent on the values of the
input function inside a compact set. Moreover, note that it is also not continuous. However, since λ1,
λ2 ∈Λ, its set of discontinuities has measure zero under the law of eΥλ1, so this does not pose an issue.
For k > 0, let x⋆,k ∈Bk denote the point where the field eΥλ1 achieves its maximum inside Bk. Then,
to overcome the issues mentioned above, we claim that the following quantity

converges to the right-hand side of (5.9) as k →∞first, and then L →∞. This follows from
Theorems A, B and Lemmas 4.20, 4.22. For brevity, we do not provide the details here, but we note
that similar computations are carried out in the proofs of Lemmas 7.12 and 7.14 below.
Now, we are in a position to apply the resampling property (2.9) of the field eΥλ1 to the quantity on the
right-hand side of (5.10) for fixed k ≥0 and L ≥0. Proceeding in this manner, performing some
algebraic rearrangements, and then removing the cutoff parameters, it is straightforward to see that the
quantity on the right-hand side of (5.9) coincides with E[F(Ψλ1)], as desired.
We now argue that the constant a⋆, defined in (2.11), is independent of λ ∈Λ. To establish this, we
first need to prove the following result concerning the constant c⋆,λ, defined in (2.6).
