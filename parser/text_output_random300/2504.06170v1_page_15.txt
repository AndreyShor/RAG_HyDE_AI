Figure 6. A schematic view of the possible position-velocity (PV) diagrams for cylindrical filaments in different gas motions.
The x-z plane represents the plane of the sky, and the y-direction corresponds to the line of observation, which forms a significant
angle (∼45◦) relative to the filament. (a) A rotating filament with a constant angular velocity, indicated by a curved arrow.
(b) A filament undergoing central collapse (motivated from Liu et al. 2019). (c) A filament undergoing end-dominated collapse
(motivated from Clarke & Whitworth 2015). The blue and red arrows in each panels represent the blue- and red-shifted velocity
components.
Table A1. The physical properties of the ATLASGAL clumps. The velocity, mass, and effective radius of these clumps are
obtained from Urquhart et al. (2018). The mass and effective radius values presented in the table have been rescaled to the
adopted distance of d = 4.66 kpc. Information on outflow activity associated with these clumps is sourced from Yang et al.
(2018).
