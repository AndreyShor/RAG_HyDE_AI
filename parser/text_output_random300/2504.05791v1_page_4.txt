less tilted vs more tilted) even when they cannot tell the difference
and their preferred choice would likely be ’the same’. In this sce-
nario, the 2AFC paradigm assumes that they will select a response
at random and become increasingly likely to select the correct re-
sponse as they become more perceptually-certain. This technique
enables the experimenter to identify a point-of-subject-equality
(PSE), where the participants’ choices are 50-50 and, thus, they per-
ceive the different stimuli to be the same. Research then adopts 25%
and 75% thresholds as the perceptual limits (see, e.g., [6, 16, 41]),
beyond which the participant is considered to be sufficiently certain
in their response.
The GRASP taxonomy proposed by Feix et al. [23] identifies
33 different grasp types. For our study, we chose to focus on the
grasp involving only the index finger and thumb of the right hand
(Palmar Pinch, leveraging pad opposition) due to its frequent use
in tool operation and its suitability for handling objects weighing
between 0 and 500 grams, with dimensions of 0 to 15 cm. This
“pinch-grasp” is especially beneficial as it remains unaffected by the
change in width from top to bottom in our tapered objects, ensuring
consistent size perception.

Experimental Conditions
We produced five physical cubes of different sizes and taper angles,
as shown in Fig. 1. We chose the same sized cubes used by Bergström
et al. [6] – 3cm, 6cm, and 9cm. In their paper, these cubes had a taper
angle of 0°. To study the interplay between size and taper angle (as
a simple operationalisation of shape), we introduced two further
angles – 8° and 16°. As 2AFC studies require repeated measures,
and in order to make our study tractable in size, we chose the
following combinations for the physical objects: 3cm-8°, 6cm-8°,
9cm-8°, 6cm-16°, and 6cm-0°.
The sizes defined for the cubes are the widths halfway up the
cube. There are six different virtual sizes for each physical object
size (distributed around the physical size, as shown in Fig. 1). The
step of virtual sizes is 1cm. The maximum width of grasping with
the thumb and the index finger is 12.42cm (SD=1.40cm) on average
for an adult human [26]. Therefore the size of our largest virtual
cube is set to be 11cm and the size of our largest physical cube is
set to be 9cm which is about 80% of the lower end of the standard
deviation. The physical and virtual settings of sizes are the same as
in prior work [6]. The height and depth for all physical and virtual
cubes are 6cm.
The taper angles of the cubes are angular-degree off the upright
of the bottom corner. This results in a inverted trapezoid object –
a shape that can be held steadily by the participants with a more
stable cone of friction [56] and less potential for slippage. This
constraint was selected to reduce confounding factors in the study.
For the virtual cubes, there are seven different angles with step
of 2◦for each physical cube. This step was determined through
pilot testing. For the cube with 0◦face orientation, there are virtual
inverted trapezoid regular trapezoid objects. The negative figures of
angles in Fig. 1 mean the shape of virtual cube sections are regular
trapezoid.
The experiment consisted of lifting the five physical objects,
each of them used as a proxy for virtual cubes across six distinct
sizes and seven different taper angles. Three of the designed virtual
cubes are infeasible (size of 1cm and taper angle of 10◦, 12◦and 14◦
– objects where the sides would cross themselves and so violate our
height requirements). Therefore, the total number of experimental
conditions is 207: 5 physical objects × 6 virtual sizes × 7 virtual
angles - 3 infeasible shapes.
