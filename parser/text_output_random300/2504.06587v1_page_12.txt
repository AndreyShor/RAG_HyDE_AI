fine-grained spectrum sensing via carefully scheduled scanning.
SweepSense [2] improves scanning speed and enables protocol
identification using cyclostationary analysis. Crescendo [3] fur-
ther improves SweepSense with power control and locked VCOs
for high-fidelity. However, sequential scanning inherently fails to
capture entire headers or monitor the full spectrum simultaneously.
Universal sub-Nyquist sampling: Sub-Nyquist sampling re-
duces the cost of wideband monitoring. Landau [51] proved that
the average sampling rate must be greater than the sum of oc-
cupied bandwidths if the spectrum occupancy is known. Under
the CS framework, Tropp et al.[73] showed multi-tone recovery
via random sub-Nyquist sampling. Mishali et al. [5] demonstrated
stable sampling above twice the Landau rate without occupancy
knowledge and empirically validated practical schemes such as
multi-coset sampling and modulated wideband converters [48],
achieving blind sampling at approximately 5.98 times the Landau
rate. More recently, Song et al. [8] optimize sub-sampling and re-
covery algorithms to achieve sampling rates as low as 5/2 of the
Landau rate for spectrum sensing tasks.
Beyond sparsity: The twice-Landau-rate bound limits wide-
band sniffing to sparse signals. Some studies bypass this sparsity
restriction by focusing on less detailed properties [74–78]. Cohen
and Eldar [77, 78] proved that twice-Landau-rate sampling is not
necessary of power spectrum and cyclic spectrum recovery. Guan
et al. [44] use MEMS acoustic resonators to sparsify analog sig-
nals, enabling non-sparse spectrum sensing. WISE [79] leverage
UWB signals for spectrum sensing, bypassing sparse recovery alto-
gether. Zhang et al. [43] incorporate deep learning for sub-Nyquist
spectrum sensing, outperforming traditional methods. While these
approaches mitigate sparsity constraints, they lose detailed infor-
mation, precluding deep physical-layer analysis.
Passive signal analysis: Non-cooperative signal analysis is
challenging due to the complexity of electromagnetic waves and
limited prior knowledge. Early work [80] used higher-order cumu-
lants for modulation classification. CNNs [81] demonstrate superior
performance over handcrafted features, and recent advancements
shift to Transformer models [66, 71, 72] for modulation and proto-
col classification. T-Prime [66] classifies fine-grained Wi-Fi signals
even with spectrum overlapping. Beyond classification, deep learn-
ing has been applied to channel state estimation [82, 83], signal
demodulation [83–85] and decoding [86, 87]. Li et al. [88] address
ultra-low SNR demodulation of LoRa signals with deep learning.
Cammerer et al. [89] implement a deep learning receiver for 5G NR
signals, though it lacks adaptability to varying parameters. These
methods focus on single-signal analysis and are unsuitable for wide
multiband scenarios.

Conclusion
We present SigChord, a Transformer-based system designed to sniff
physical layer signals in wide and non-sparse spectra. Existing
methods face significant trade-offs, either failing to capture the en-
tire spectrum concurrently, losing critical details, or relying heavily
on sparsity constraints. SigChord addresses these challenges by
integrating sub-Nyquist sampling with the powerful representation
capabilities of Transformer networks. It achieves signal recovery
exceeding the sub-Nyquist sampling limit through a rule-based
Transformer network, reducing the SOTA sampling rate from 2.5
times the Landau rate to 1.66 and lower. And signal analysis process
is simplified with cascaded Transformer networks. Experimental
results show that SigChord excels in key tasks such as spectrum
sensing, signal recovery, protocol identification, and header decod-
ing, all while achieving real-time on a consumer-level GPU.
