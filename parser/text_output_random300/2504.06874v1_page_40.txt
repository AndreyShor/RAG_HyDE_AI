optical contrast from Vg = 0 V to positive maximum Vg are denoted by red dots, those 
measured from positive maximum Vg to negative maximum Vg are denoted by the blues 
dots, and those measured from negative maximum Vg back to Vg = 0 V are denoted by 
green dots. The charge neutrality point roughly lies at = 170 V (indicated by the gray 
dashed lines), which can also be inferred from the vanishing amplitude of the plasmon 
fringes reflected by the domain wall. The yellow shaded area marks the carrier density 
from 0 to hole doping density of 6.24 × 1012𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐−2, where the optical contrast shows 
an increasing trend with increasing hole doping. The white boxes in (b) label the sample 
areas of the two nearby regions in adjacent ABAB and ABCB stackings in which the 
optical contrasts are extracted.

Fig. S23. Schematic illustration of a second possibility regarding the interlayer 
sliding. a-c, Schematics of the second possibility in which sliding the top two layers 
together (as shown in (b)) also corresponds to the blue DW motion in (a) and that sliding 
the bottom layer alone (as shown in (c)) also corresponds to the green DW motion in 
(a), respectively. Note that ABAB and CACA, and ABAC and CACB stackings are 
equivalent stacking orders.
