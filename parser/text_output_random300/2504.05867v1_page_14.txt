the model proposed by H. Liu & J. Bai (2015). Further,
the SMBH mass of ON 246, estimated using the optical
timescale derived from DRW modeling, is (1.56±0.66)×
108M⊙.
The estimated black hole mass of ON 246, derived
from variability characteristics in both energy bands,
falls within the range of (0.142 −8.22) × 109 M⊙. The
estimated mass also lies in the range (108–109 M⊙) of
mass of SMBH for FSRQ as derived in various studies
(G. Ghisellini & F. Tavecchio 2008; G. Castignani et al.
2013; D. R. Xiong & X. Zhang 2014; V. S. Paliya et al.
2021; X. Zhang et al. 2024) using various sample of FS-
RQs. Using the gamma-ray variability time Z. Pei et al.
(2022) have also estimated the mass of the black hole,
but the value is close to ∼8.08×107 M⊙, which is much
smaller than the value estimated above. This discrep-
ancy is because in Z. Pei et al. (2022), authors have used
a fixed variability time of 1 day and the Doppler factor
(δ) as a very small value of 0.48.
8. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated quasi-periodic signals in
the γ-ray and optical emissions of the blazar ON 246
(4FGL J1230.2+2517) over the period of 11.6 yr, from
MJD 55932 to 60081, employing three different method-
ologies as outlined in Section 3. Our analysis reveals a
distinct quasi-periodic signal in the γ-ray emissions of
the blazar ON 246, with periods of approximately 746
days, 757 days, and 781 days, as identified using the
Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP), Wavelet Weighted Z-
transform (WWZ), and REDFIT analysis, respectively.
The significance of the detected periodicity was assessed
through two independent approaches: Monte Carlo sim-
ulations and stochastic modeling using the damped ran-
dom walk (DRW) model. The dominant peaks detected
in both LSP and WWZ have a local significance level
above 3σ, based on Monte Carlo simulations, and ex-
ceed 3σ when evaluated using DRW modeling. The un-
certainties in the observed periods were estimated as
the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) by fitting the
peak profiles with a Gaussian function. The QPO de-
tected in γ-ray emissions is further corroborated by an
independent analysis of the optical light curve. Using
the same methodologies, we searched for oscillatory sig-
nals in the optical data and assessed their significance. A
similar periodicity of ∼757, ∼763, and ∼757 days were
found in LSP, WWZ, and REDFIT analyses, respec-
tively, with a significance level exceeding 3σ, reinforcing
the presence of the detected QPO.
In addition, we also employed the interpolation cross-
correlation function (ICCF) to analyze the correlation
between γ-ray and optical emissions. As display in the
figure 11, it can be seen that the correlation coefficient is
maximum at near zero time-lag, with τcent = 0.736+3.13
−2.73
d, have a significance level exceeding 4σ, indicating that
the variability features between these two bands are sim-
ilar in nature and is believed to be originated by the
lepton single-zone scenario of blazar emission (D. P. Co-
hen et al. 2014). Studying correlations across multiple
wavebands is crucial for gaining deeper insights into the
emission mechanisms of these systems. A strong correla-
tion between low-energy and high-energy emissions can
be well explained by the leptonic model. In this scenario,
low-energy radiation originates from synchrotron emis-
sion, while the same seed photons undergo synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) and inverse Compton scattering to
produce high-energy radiation, leading to a significant
correlation between the two energy bands (L. Maraschi
et al. 1992; P. Giommi et al. 1999; G. Tagliaferri et al.
2003; Y. Zheng et al. 2013; N. Liao et al. 2014; H. Li
et al. 2016).
Conversely, when high-energy emission is generated
through the external Compton process, which involves
seed photons originating outside the jet (M. P. Malmrose
et al. 2011; N. Liao et al. 2014), the correlation between
low-energy and high-energy emissions tends to weaken
or become insignificant. Our findings reveal a strong cor-
relation between the optical and γ-ray emissions of the
blazar ON 246, supporting the leptonic model’s predic-
tions. A. Acharyya et al. (2023) observed a strong corre-
lation between MeV and GeV emissions with a peak at
zero time-lag, suggesting the same origin, and also found
the positive time-lags with radio and optical emissions.
In this study, we employed three different methods
to estimate the black hole (BH) mass of the blazar ON
246 based on its variability characteristics.
First, we
determined the lower and upper limits of the BH mass
using the models proposed by J. Yang & J. Fan (2010)
and H. Liu & J. Bai (2015), respectively.
The mini-
mum variability timescale observed in the γ-ray band
yielded a lower mass limit of M∗> 0.142×109 M⊙. For
the upper limit, we obtained M∗< 2.74 × 109 M⊙for a
Schwarzschild black hole, and M∗< 8.22×109 M⊙for a
maximally rotating Kerr black hole. In a third approach,
we utilized the damping timescales of γ-ray and optical
light curves, applying an empirical correlation between
the rest-frame damping timescale (τ Damping
rest
) and the BH
mass, as established by C. J. Burke et al. (2021). This
method yielded BH mass estimates of (7.3±6)×109 M⊙
from γ-ray variability and (1.56 ± 0.66) × 108 M⊙from
optical variability.
Combining these results, we con-
strain the BH mass of ON 246 to lie within the range of
approximately (0.142 −8.22) × 109 M⊙.
