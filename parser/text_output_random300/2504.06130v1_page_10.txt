FIG. 4. Intensity-dependent SHG process and comparison with the theoretical model.
a, Power-dependent SHG datasets for 1560 nm, 1510 nm and 1490 nm (blue, orange, and green
dots) on a linear scale.
The 1560 nm data follows perfectly the lower gray dashed line, corre-
sponding to a fit with ξ = 2. Instead, the scaling for 1510 (1490 nm) decreases (increases) for
higher power values compared to the upper gray dashed line. b, Schematic of scaling deviations:
SHG emission is enhanced when two photons match the resonance condition with the A:1s exciton
state. A bandgap shift ∆E alters this resonance, increasing SHG efficiency for a different photon
energy. c, Experimental second-harmonic intensities ISHG plotted for the approximate maximum
(IFB,max ≈5 GW cm−2; blue dots) and minimum FB intensity (IFB,min ≈1.5 GW cm−2, red dots).
Dashed lines with same colors show the fitted intensities IFit calculated with the analytical expres-
sion. Dotted lines indicate the calculated respective blueshift ∆EOS/BS of the resonance by the
OS and BS shifts for Edet = 0 eV. d, Comparison of the analytical SH intensity difference (black
dashed line) caused by the perturbation α with our numerical simulations (purple dashed line).
(determined from the PL peak position in Fig. 2b). The unknown parameters include the
dephasing time T2 and the absolute value of dipole moment at the ±K-points, d. To extract
