The Lifshitz theory provides a semiclassical description of the Casimir-Polder atom-plate
interaction, where the electromagnetic ﬁeld is quantized whereas the material of the plate
is considered as a continuous medium. This places certain restrictions on its application
regarding the allowable atom-plate separation distances and the dielectric properties of
the plate material. Below we demonstrate that in some recent literature the application
conditions of the Lifshitz theory established by its founders are violated by applying it
at too short separations and using the dielectric permittivities possessing the negative
imaginary parts in violation of the second law of thermodynamics.
Keywords: Lifshitz theory; dielectric permittivity; second law of thermodynamics.

1. Introduction
The Lifshitz formula for the interaction potential between an atom and a plate
expresses it as a functional of the dynamic polarizability of an atom and the
frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity of the plate material. As established
by the founders of the Lifshitz theory,1–3 it provides a description of the Casimir-
Polder interaction under a condition
l ≪z,
(1)
where z is the atom-plate separation and l is the lattice constant of the plate
material. Just this condition allows to consider the plate material as a continuous
medium and use the idealization of the dielectric permittivity.1–3
The short-range regime of the Lifshitz formula, where the Casimir-Polder inter-
action behaves as 1/z3, holds for
z ≪λ0,
(2)
where λ0 is the characteristic wavelength for the absorption spectrum of the plate
material.2–4 Calculations show that here much less means that z should be less than
