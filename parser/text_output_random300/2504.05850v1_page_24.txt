To the author’s knowledge it is impossible to do this calculation (even numerically) with any other
method. The number PG is contained in the Q-span of periods in pure ϕ4 theory.
11.6. The status of Yukawa-ϕ4 theory. For a given completed graph G there exist many different
ways (hundreds if G has 6 loops) to choose the external vertices 0, 1, z, ∞such that the Feynman period
can be calculated with graphical functions. All results agree, which establishes a strong test for the
correctness of the implementation.
Up to four loops in the primitive graphs (six or seven loops in the completed graphs) all periods could
be calculated. By the time of writing, at five loops the evaluations of eleven out of 705 graphs are missing.
At higher loop orders the gaps grow rapidly. We calculated individual graphs up to eight loops in the
beta function of the Yukawa vertex, corresponding to 10 loops in the completed graph, see Section 11.5.
The number content of the Feynman periods that could be calculated is identical to ϕ4 theory. In
particular, the coaction conjectures also seem to hold in the presence of a Yukawa interaction [11].
However, until now the selection of graphs whose Feynman period has been calculated is biased towards
