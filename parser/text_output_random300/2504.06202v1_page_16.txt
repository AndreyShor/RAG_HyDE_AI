4.3
Proof of the separation lemma for CLE
In what follows, we aim to prove Lemma 4.3 concerning the quality Qε(Ls), and then use it to prove
the main separation result, i.e. Proposition 4.1. We begin by establishing some key ingredients,
and we then complete the proof of separation in the end.
Let M := ⌊log2(r/ε)⌋(≥1 by assumption). Set r0 := ε. For all 1 ≤i ≤M, let ri := 2iε, and
let A(i) := E2(ε, ri; Bri+1) be the local arm event. Let e
A(i) ⊆A(i) be the stable arm event that
there are exactly two clusters C1 and C2 in Lri+1 across the annulus Aε,ri, and for each j = 1, 2,
Cj contains a subcluster of Lri that crosses Aε,ri−1.
(4.8)
The following lemma upper bounds P(A(i)) by a combination of P( e
A(i)) and P(A(i −1)),
which can be roughly regarded as a kind of stability result on arm events. This stability result
is an additional technicality in the proof of Lemma 4.3, compared to those we proved in [13]. It
turns out to be quite important to make the recursive procedure (4.12) work (which is a standard
step in the proof of separation lemma). It is worth putting this lemma in the first place in order
to emphasize its importance. The other two ingredients Lemma 4.9 and Lemma 4.10 are more
standard (although additional complexities emerge due to the convoluted definition of quality),
which are indeed analogous to Lemma 4.5 and Lemma 4.4 in [13], respectively.
Lemma 4.8. There is a constant c > 0 such that the following holds. For all δ > 0, there exists a
constant b(δ) > 0 such that for all i ≥2,
P(A(i)) ≤b(δ) P( e
A(i)) + δc P(A(i −1)).
(4.9)
Proof. Let ¯
A(i) ⊆A(i) be the event that there are exactly two crossing clusters of Aε,ri in Lri+1.
By the BK inequality (similar to (3.1)), we have P(A(i)) ≲P( ¯
A(i)). Hence, it suffices to show (4.9)
for ¯
A(i) in place of A(i). First, we explore all the loops in Lri, and let Λ0 := Λ(Bε, Lri). On the
event ¯
A(i), we can find two loops γ1 and γ2 in Lri+1 that both intersect Λ0 and ∂Bri, and they
belong to two different crossing clusters in Lri+1, which are denoted by C1 and C2 below. For each
j = 1, 2, we check if Cj satisfies the condition (4.8).
Case (1). We first consider the case that both C1 and C2 do not satisfy (4.8). Given C1 and C2,
all the other clusters in Lri+1 that intersect Bε are contained in Bri−1 with some positive probability,
which is assumed now. Then, we have Λ0 ⊂Bri−1, and γ1 and γ2 are a pair of non-intersecting
loops that intersect Λ0 and cross Ari−1,ri. In fact, this is just a continuous analogue of the discrete
event ¯E2, which we already dealt with in Lemma 5.8 of [13]. Using a similar Markovian exploration
therein with Lemma 4.4 as an input now, we can show the result as follows (we refer the reader to
the proof of Lemma 5.8 of [13] for details). With a positive cost, one can modify the loops γ1 and γ2
such that they are contained in Bri, well-separated at scale 1.5 ri−1, and they retain the connection
(i.e., the refreshed crossing clusters in Lri containing them are disjoint and cross Aε,ri−1). After
this modification, we can extend the two crossing clusters to scale ri by using two loops in Lri+1
that intersect ∂Bri. This implies e
A(i), and it only costs a positive constant because the refreshed
crossing clusters are well-separated now. We conclude P( ¯
A(i)) ≲P( e
A(i)) in this case.
Case (2). Next, we consider the case that (4.8) is true for C1 but not for C2. We can further
assume that there is a subcluster C′
1 of Lri that crosses Aε,ri−1 with dist(C′
1, ∂Bri) ≤δri, and hooked
by γ1. Otherwise, we are in a similar situation as case (1): two loops crossing A(1−δ)ri,ri that make
clusters in B(1−δ)ri connect to ∂Bri. Note that the multiplicative constant now depends on δ, which
