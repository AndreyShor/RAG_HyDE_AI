The excitation rates calculations
assume a ground to Rydberg state dephasing rate κ.
Additional details are provided in the Appendix.
The corresponding rate equations are:
˙ngg =γ0n0 −(ngg −ngr)Λ −(ngg −ndd)Λ1
−(ngg −ndf)Λ2 + Γngr −γ0ngg

˙ngr =(ngg −ngr)Λ + 2Γ(ndd + ndf)
−(Γ + γ + γ0)ngr
(1b)
˙ndd =(ngg −ndd)Λ1 −(2Γ + 2γ + γ0)ndd

˙ndf =(ngg −ndf)Λ2 −(η + 2Γ + 2γ + γ0)ndf

The steady-state solution of Eqs. (1) was computed and
used to evaluate two quantities: the ground-state popu-
lation ngg assumed to be the main parameter controlling
the IR laser absorption and the total atomic population
determining the MOT fluorescence brightness.
As an
example, the ground state population obtained for fixed
inter-atomic distance R = a = 2.2 µm and polar angle
θ = π/2 is represented by the dashed magenta line in
Fig. 9.
In order to relate the theoretical results with the ex-
perimental observation, a pair distance distribution has
to be assumed in the cold sample. We consider a frozen
sample approximation [17, 37] with an isotropic distri-
bution of the orientation of the inter-atomic axis and an
inter-atomic distance distribution corresponding to the
nearest-neighbor distance distribution in an ideal gas of
point-like classical particles: p(R) = 3
a( R
a )2 exp [−( R
a )3]
[38–40] For comparison, we also consider a more localized
Gaussian interatomic distribution g(R) ∝exp [−( R−a
wa )2]
with wa = a/10 (see inset in Fig. 9).
The blue traces in Fig.
9 show the relative change
in the ground state population (representative of the
IR absorption) obtained after integration over R and θ
using the two pair-distance distributions p(R) and g(R).
The red traces correspond to the variation of the total
atomic population (MOT brightness). The parameters
used in the calculations are indicated in the figure
caption. The values of the parameters κ, ΩOpt, ΩMW
and Γ are representative of the actual experimental
conditions. The rates γ0, γ and η were estimated from
the transient signal evolutions presented in Fig. 4.
The theoretical modeling relies on several simplifying
assumptions among which:
a) Small number of basis
states limited to Rydberg levels 55D and 54F of Rb. b)
Neglect of the spin orbit interaction (preventing the in-
clusion of states 56P in the basis set). c) Simplistic treat-
ment of the vdW interaction for pairs of Rydberg atoms
in |D, D⟩states considered isotropic.
This is a conse-
quence of the reduced number of states included in the

Nevertheless, in spite of the many simplifying assump-
tions, the model succeeds in reproducing the essential
features of the spectroscopic observations. It correctly
reproduces the absorption/MOT-brightness peaks ob-
served for MW frequencies resonant with Rydberg tran-
sitions which are the consequence of the the AT effect.
It also predicts the increase in transparency/atom-loss
over a broad MW frequency range corresponding from
the lifting of the {|D, F⟩, |D, F⟩} dressed atom-pair
energy degeneracy by the DDI.

DISCUSSION
The spectrum presented in Fig. 2 reveals a significant
increase in the sample transparency when the MW
frequency is tuned over a broad frequency range to the
blue of the D →F transition. Maximum transparency
occurs around 14.5 GHz.
At this frequency the EIT
increase is comparable in size to the EIT reduction
observed on resonance with the 55D →54F transition.
The images presented in Fig.
3 confirm that the in-
