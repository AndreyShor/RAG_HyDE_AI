Introduction
The theory of Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos (GMC) involves the study of random measures that can
be formally expressed as
µγ(dx) “=” eγX(x)dx ,
(1.1)
where γ > 0 is a real positive parameter representing the inverse temperature of the model, X is a
log-correlated Gaussian field on a domain D ⊆Rd, and dx denotes Lebesgue measure on D. Since
X only exists as a random Schwartz distribution, regularisation and renormalisation are necessary to
show the existence of the measure µγ as defined above [Kah85,DS11,RV14,Sha16,Ber17].
It is by now well-known that the behaviour of the random measure (1.1) exhibits a phase transition at
γc
def=
√
2d .
Following standard convention, we call the regime γ < γc subcritical, the borderline case γ = γc
critical, and the range γ > γc supercritical. These three different regimes differ in the normalisation
needed to obtain a non-trivial limiting measure, as well as in the qualitative features of the limiting
measure (see also [LRV15] for a more detailed phase diagram including complex values of γ).
Notably, in the supercritical regime, the limiting random measure is not measurable with respect to
the underlying field X and is purely atomic. Before delving into more details and stating our main
results, we introduce the family of log-correlated fields we will be working with.
The class of ⋆-scale invariant fields. We consider log-correlated Gaussian fields X on Rd with
short-range correlations, which naturally admit an approximation by a martingale (Xt)t≥0. Here, each
Xt is a smooth Gaussian field, and for every x ∈Rd, the process (Xt(x))t≥0 is a standard Brownian
motion. Moreover, these fields satisfy a certain type of scale-invariance called ⋆-scale invariance
[RV14, Section 2.3]. In a nutshell, it states that for any s, t > 0, the fields Xt and Xt+s −Xt are
independent, and that the latter is equal in law to the field Xs, spatially rescaled by a factor et.
The key ingredient in constructing a ⋆-scale invariant field is the so-called seed covariance function
K : Rd →R, which we assume satisfies the following properties:
(K1) K is positive definite, radial, and K(0) = 1.
(K2) K ∈C∞(Rd) and it is supported in B(0, 1).
Remark 1.1. The unit ball appearing in (K2) can of course be replaced by any compact subset of Rd.
We write K : Rd →R for the (unique) positive definite function such that the convolution of K with
itself equals K.
