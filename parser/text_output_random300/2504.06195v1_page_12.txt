the benefit of applying full-spectrum linear regression in the Si-based cases. As we will observe in 
later sections, unlike our prior study where linear models could leverage the additive effects of 
multiple linearly shifting features, the current full-spectrum approach yields modest enhancements 
in silicon structures due to the global nonlinearity embedded in their resonant response. 
 
Figure 6. Peak location shift vs bulk index in Si-based meta-grating under (a) TM, and (b) TE polarizarions. Linear 
behavior is evident while the 8209 nm peak in (a) demonstrates the most linear behavior and the least MSE. Our prior 
work showed that combining the peaks results in accuracy improvement up to 3 orders of magnitude. 
Table 1 summarizes the one-dimensional linear regression performance for selected peaks 
shown in Figure 6, based on their index-dependent shifts. For each peak, the MSE and MSE 
standard deviation across five-fold cross-validation are reported. The peaks are chosen from both 
TM and TE polarization modes of the Si-based structure. Notably, the 8209 nm peak under TM 
polarization demonstrates the lowest MSE (0.0294 Â± 0.0068), indicating a highly linear 
relationship with refractive index (see Fig. 6(a)). In contrast, some TE-polarized peaks, particularly 
at shorter wavelengths, exhibit higher MSE values, highlighting their limited utility for accurate 
linear modeling. These results reinforce the importance of feature selection when using single-
variable models and provide a benchmark for evaluating data-driven multivariate approaches.
