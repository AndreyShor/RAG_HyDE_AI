Figure 4.
Distributions of the final pair sample (limited to z > 0.5, and G < 20.5) in Gaia BP - RP color (left) and separation
(right).
These distributions are based on the raw pair statistics, without corrections for the star–quasar superpositions in
< 1.′′5 pairs based on the PCA and literature search, and pair incompleteness (see Section 2.2.2 and Section 2.4, respectively).
The color distributions (left) of matched DR16Q quasars in the pair, i.e., “QSO-DR16Q” (black) and companions classified as
“QSO-like” based on proper-motion cut (blue) are different from that of companions classified as “starlike” (orange), although
the color distribution of “QSO-like” companions has more fraction of red objects compared to DR16Q quasars, suggesting the
existence of potential stellar contamination. The pair separation distributions (right) are also different for pairs with QSO-like
and starlike companions: the pair separation distribution for star-like companions decreases rapidly at smaller separations,
which is expected due to the reduced geometric cross-section for foreground superpositions; in contrast, the pair separation
distribution for QSO-like companions remains relatively uniform across these separations
Figure 5. Statistical properties of the parent pair sample. Left: G-band magnitude distribution for the quasar component in
DR16Q (G1) in each pair. Right: magnitude contrast (G2-G1) between the companion and the DR16Q quasar as a function
of pair separation. At large separations, the companion can be significantly brighter than the DR16Q quasar, particularly in
the case of starlike companions. Nevertheless, the majority of pairs exhibit a flux contrast of less than a factor of 10. Similar
to Figure 1, the pairs shown here have not been corrected for incompleteness in the subarcsecond regime nor filtered using the
PCA.
