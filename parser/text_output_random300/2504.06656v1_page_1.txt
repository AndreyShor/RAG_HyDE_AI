Abstract
We conduct a detailed exploration of charged Higgs boson masses MH± within the range of 100−190 GeV .
This investigation is grounded in the benchmark points that comply with experimental constraints, allowing
us to systematically account for uncertainties inherent in the analysis.
Our results indicate signiﬁcant
production prospects for the process H+H−→τνττντ, which could provide essential insights into the
properties of H± bosons. By examining these decay channels, we aim to illuminate the interplay between the
charged Higgs boson and the established Standard Model. The research uses machine learning methods like
Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), as well as Likelihood and LikelihoodD,
to improve the identiﬁcation of heavy charged Higgs bosons compared to Standard Model backgrounds at a
3.0 TeV γγ collider with an integrated luminosity of Lint = 3000 fb−1.
