This fact suggests that the cavity and the bubbling geometry descriptions should be reconciled
within the same SL(2, Z) duality frame. The previous match in [1] of a probe D1-brane in the
cavity with the maximally irreducible representation also suggets that the bubbling geometries
and the cavity are in the same duality frame. How this works remains to be fully understood.
