prove its integrability, for example, by developing the inverse scattering trans-
form. However, we now know that (1) it is a reduction of equations of the
integrable ALH and that (2) it possesses N-soliton solutions. These two facts
are a strong indication that (1.3) is integrable. Nevertheless, we think that
the work in this direction should be continued, and one of the first problems
to solve is to find the conservation laws of the model, which may be a topic
of the following study.
Appendix.
Here we demonstrate that ansatz (3.5)–(3.8) leads to the solutions of the
(2.7) and (2.8)
As follows from (3.5) and (3.10),
Eξ
1q−
1q
=
⟨Eξa|R−1(EξF)|b⟩−⟨a|R−1F|b⟩
=
⟨Eξa|R−1(EξF)|b⟩−⟨Eξa|R−1JξF|b⟩
which can be rewritten as
Eξ
1q−
1q= ⟨Eξa|R−1(EξF)XF|b⟩
(A.1)
where X is defined by
(EξF)XF = EξF −JξF.
Using the definition of F (3.9), (3.12) and then (3.1) one can obtain
X
=
1 −Jξ + BA −(EξB)(EξA)Jξ
=
ξR−1 + BA −(EξB)A
=
ξR−1 + ξBL−1A
=
ξR−1F−1 + ξR−1|b⟩⟨b|L−1A.
Substituting this expression into (A.1) and using (3.8) together with the
identity AF = GA, one arrives at
Eξ
1q−
1q
=
ξ⟨Eξa|R−1(EξF)R−1|b⟩+ ξ⟨Eξa|R−1(EξF)R−1|b⟩⟨b|L−1AF|b⟩
=
ξ
2r Eξu
which is nothing but the first equation from (2.7).
In a similar way one can prove that
2q satisfies the first equation from
(2.8).
Eξ
2q−
2q
=
⟨Eξa|R−1(EξF)(EξB)|a⟩−⟨a|R−1FB|a⟩
=
⟨Eξa|R−1(EξF)YG|a⟩
