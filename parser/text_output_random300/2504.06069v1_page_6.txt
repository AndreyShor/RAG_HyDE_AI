In this section we discuss the physical constraints embedded in the network architecture and loss

Sine - Cosine Representation for Phase Wrapping 
Phase prediction in the modelling of metasurface optical response presents important challenges 
compared to standard regression problems because of cyclic nature of phase values. The main 
challenge in direct phase prediction methods is discontinuities at the boundaries like 0 and 2𝜋. For 
instance, phase values of 0.1𝜋 and 1.99𝜋 seem numerically far apart, but they are close values in the 
circular phase space because 0 and 2𝜋 represent a same phase. Such a discontinuity creates artificial 
gradients during training process which do not reflect the physical nature of the problem. 
To address this issue, we used a physics-informed representation in which phase branch of the 
network is decomposed into two output nodes: its sine and cosine components. Rather than directly 
predicting phase angle 𝜑, our network simultaneously predicts sin(𝜑) and cos⁡(𝜑) using hyperbolic 
tangent (tanh) activation functions for both components. This activation function naturally constrains 
outputs to the range of [-1 , 1] which is perfectly matched with the range of sine and cosine functions. 
This sine-cosine representation offers several advantages. Unlike direct phase prediction, sine/cosine 
functions eliminate discontinuities at the boundaries because they produce same values for phases 
like 0 and 2𝜋. This representation also maps any phase angles differing by 2𝜋 (e.g., 𝜑 and 𝜑+ 2𝜋) to 
identical points. Thus, the network does not need to learn that they are the same physical states as
