 occur due to the critical balance of the 
plasma's rotation frequency with the gravitational potential, causing resonances that can alter the 
ion motion. This represent conditions where the system's stability is highly sensitive, and small 
perturbations can result in large, potentially unstable responses in the quantum plasma.
