FIG. 2: Cooperation fraction as a function of the temptation to defect b in the multi-game
system for individuals with and without an advantageous environment and resource
transfer dynamics. The following scenarios are compared: (i) Players without an
advantageous environment (µ = 0) and without resources (ϵ = 0); (ii) players with an
advantageous environment (µ = 0.2) but without resource transfer (ϵ = 0); (iii) players
without an advantageous environment (µ = 0) but with resources transfer (ϵ = 0.1); (iv)
players with both an advantageous environment (µ = 0.2) and resources (ϵ = 0.1). Other
fixed relevant parameters in the simulation are ω = 0.5, σ = 0.2.
over the last 104 full steps of a total of 105 steps. To ensure statistical accuracy, the reported
results are averaged over 50 independent realizations for each parameter configuration.
