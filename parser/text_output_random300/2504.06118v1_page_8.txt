FIG. 5. Relative logarithmic likelihood (ln L), logarithmic volume factor (ln V ), and Bayesian evidence (ln E) with respect to the
ΛCDM model, plotted against Neff—the effective number of degrees of freedom that remain after applying the Horndeski-based
correlation prior. The strength of this prior is varied by adding different values of ∆to its diagonal. For comparison, we show
both the analytically estimated ln E (calculated as ln L + ln V ) and the numerically computed values obtained via Polychord.
The top panel presents results derived using DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) BAO data, while the bottom panel corresponds to
DESI Data Release 2 (DR2). The Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) priors and constraints on the CMB acoustic scale θ∗are
imposed in all cases. The shaded region highlights values of ∆for which the correlation prior is affected by the flat prior of the
w bins. See texts for further discussion.
