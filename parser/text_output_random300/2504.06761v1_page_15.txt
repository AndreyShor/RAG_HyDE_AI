Constructing wall turbulence

streamwise velocity near the wall. Spectral analysis confirms a 𝑘−1 energy scaling at large
scales, consistent with DNS results. Moreover, SWAT demonstrates the ability to capture
higher-order dynamics, such as even-order velocity moments. While the model successfully
reproduces many key features, some discrepancies suggest avenues for further improvement,
such as refining the representation of inner-outer interaction dynamics (Marusic et al. 2010)
to enhance the accuracy of large-scale motions and their coupling with near-wall structures.
Beyond its physical accuracy, our method provides a practical advantage by enabling
the rapid generation of initial conditions for wall turbulence at any Reynolds number
within arbitrary computational domains – without requiring additional data. This capability
significantly reduces computational costs in the early stages of simulations, whether for DNS
or LES, while ensuring statistical and structural consistency with real turbulence.
Looking ahead, this framework offers exciting possibilities for extending wall turbulence
modeling to more complex geometries and rough surfaces, providing a powerful tool for
advancing turbulence research and improving turbulence models. Future work will focus
on assessing the framework in more canonical wall-bounded flows, such as the turbulent
boundary layer and pipe flow. These well-characterized cases offer critical benchmarks for
testing accuracy and robustness, laying the groundwork for applications to more complex
flow scenarios. Additionally, the ability to rapidly generate turbulence conditions makes it
well-suited for integration into adaptive and dynamic simulation environments. This could
benefit a range of applications, including aircraft aerodynamics, weather modeling, and
industrial flow simulations, where turbulence conditions frequently change.
Appendix A. Sensitivity analysis of model parameters for synthetic wall
turbulence
In this appendix, we analyze the sensitivity of the constant parameters introduced in §2 for
SWAT, specifically the core variation coefficient 𝐶𝜎in (2.5) and the circulation coefficient
𝐶Γ in (2.10).
Figures 9(a,b) illustrate the sensitivity of the mean velocity profile and Reynolds stresses to
variations in the core variation coefficient, tested at 𝐶𝜎= 0.1, 0.3, 0.5. The results indicate
that both the mean velocity and Reynolds stress profiles remain largely insensitive to changes
in this parameter, and we select 𝐶𝜎= 0.3 for our model.
For the circulation coefficient, we perform a sensitivity analysis for 𝐶Γ = 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, as
shown in figures9(c,d). Since the induced velocity of each hairpin vortex scales proportionally
with the circulation coefficient, i.e., Δ𝑈( 𝑗)

∝Γ( 𝑗)

∝𝐶Γ, variations in 𝐶Γ primarily affect
the Reynolds stress components, particularly the slope of ⟨𝑢2⟩in the logarithmic region. In
contrast, the influence on the mean velocity profile is relatively minor. Therefore, careful
selection is necessary to accurately reproduce velocity moments in SWAT velocity fields.
Based on these observations, we set 𝐶Γ = 2.0, for the cases across different Reynolds
numbers, ensuring an optimal match with the mean velocity and Reynolds stress profiles.
Appendix B. Contributions of individual hierarchies to statistical profiles
In this appendix, we analyze the influence of vortex packets at different hierarchies and
superstructures on the overall statistical properties. Specifically, we quantify how individual
hierarchical contributions shape the mean velocity profile using the velocity defect
