2.5.2
Calibration training
More explicit guarantees can be obtained under
Assumption 2.4. Let ˆYm ∼P ˆY and Ym ∼P ˆY , m = 1 . . . , M, be the noisy
and noiseless i.i.d. outputs of a QC device and
ˆ
BC(Y, ˆY ) the corresponding
empirical estimation of (1). Then, for any ˆY and Y , there exists a scalar
function, bc = bc(ˆY ), that approximates
ˆ
BC(Y, ˆY ) and obeys
εBC = |bc(ˆY ) −ˆ
BC(Y, ˆY )| ⊥⊥(ˆY , Y )
(22)
i.e. has attribute-independent residuals.
In this case, we can prove the following
Theorem 2.5. Let
ˆ
BC and bc be as in Assumption 2.4, ˆYnm ∼P ˆYn and
Ynm ∼P ˆYn, n = 1, . . . , N + 1, m = 1 . . . , M, be the noisy and noiseless
outputs of N +1 QC devices, and
ˆ
BCn, n =, . . . , N, the associated empirical
estimation of (1). Then, for any t > 0 and any α ∈(0, 1),

Remark. Assuming there exists a conditional model of a circuit’s BC
with ˆY -independent residuals is a weaker assumption than assuming the
existence of the QEM function ϵnoise in (3).
Proof of Theorem 2.5. By assumption, | ˆ
BCn −bc( ˆYn)| are i.i.d. and then
exchangeable. The definition of qα implies
