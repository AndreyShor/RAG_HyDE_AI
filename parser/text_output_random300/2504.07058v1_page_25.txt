Figure 17 presents a graphical comparison of the approximate solutions obtained using PINN and the exact solution
for the model represented by Eq. (3.23). The results indicate that the PINN-based approximation aligns closely
with the exact solution, validating its stability. Additionally, Fig. 17a illustrates the variation in tumor cell density
over time 𝑡. A three-dimensional visualization comparing the PINN and exact solutions is provided in Fig. 17b.
Furthermore, Table 8 presents the relative error E𝑟
𝐺and training error E𝑇alongside the chosen hyper-parameters.

2D extended Fisher–Kolmogorov equation:
The 2D equation has following exact solution [3] [24] :

.
The source term is derived from the exact solution. The model is solved for different parameter values over time.
Both the exact and predicted solutions are presented in contour and 3D surface formats, as shown in the following
sub-figures. Figures 18, 19, and 20 present a graphical comparison of the approximate solutions obtained using
PINN and the exact solution for varying values of 𝛽, displayed as contour plots and 3D visualizations. The results
show that the PINN-based approximation closely matches the exact solution, confirming its stability. Additionally,
Fig. 17a illustrates the changes in tumor cell density over time 𝑡. Table 9 reports the relative error E𝑟
𝐺and training
error E𝑇along with the selected hyper-parameters.
