Morioka et al. [16] irradiated 4H-SiC epitaxial layer with 2 MeV electrons to generate isolated VSi centers. 
To ensure that vacancies were in the desired negatively charged state, a slightly n-type doped material 
was used. The samples were then annealed at 300°C for 30 min to eliminate unwanted defects. Fuchs et 
al. [58] also used 4H-SiC, but instead of electron irradiation, they employed reactor neutrons with energies 
ranging from 0.18 to 2.5 MeV. The highest neutron irradiation fluence, 5 × 1017 cm-2, required a multi-step 
thermal annealing process at temperatures ranging from 125 to 700°C for 90 min [58].  
Pavunny et al. [18] have performed room-temperature 100 keV Li ion beam implantation in the form of 
10 × 10 square matrix arrays of spots. Figure 7 shows PL spectrum at 4.8 K acquired from an individual 
spot of a 10 × 10 array implanted at a dose of 1.2 × 1014 ions/cm2. The single spot (600 ions/spot) is 
identified (red circle) in the low-temperature confocal fluorescence map (Fig.7, inset).

Kraus et al. [17] demonstrated a method by using focused proton beams for controlled defect generation 
without the need for pre- or post-annealing treatments. By matching the proton energy to the stopping 
power of the material, the generation depth and resolution could be precisely controlled, and the number 
of defects in a specific volume was tunable. Similar results were achieved by laser writing [14]. The focused 
ion beam and laser writing methods represent the most promising methods for highly localized and well-
controlled defect formation in SiC. The key experimental methods used for introducing VSi into SiC are 
summarized in Table 3.
