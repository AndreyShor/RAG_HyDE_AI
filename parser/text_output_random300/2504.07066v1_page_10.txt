FIG. 4. JT and VLT phase diagrams for the tFeSC model.
(a) Gap distribution of Andreev bound states in a (100)-
directional π-junction in the (µ, ky) parameter space, with
kz = π. We find two on-TRIM JT critical points and one
off-TRIM JT critical pair. (b-c) Mirror-indexed Wilson loop
as a function of ky at µ = −0.10 (b) and µ = 0.30 (c). The
Mx = +i sector is labeled in red and the negative mirror sec-
tor is labeled in blue. (d) Evolution of CdGM states for a
(001)-directional vortex-line in the same system. Topologi-
cally distinct regions are shown in different colors.

Topological iron-based superconductor
We proceed to investigate a minimal effective model
of the topological iron-based superconductor (tFeSC),
which was first proposed in Ref. [28] to describe the
intriguing vortex physics in high-Tc iron-based systems
such as LiFeAs and Fe(Te,Se). While Ref. [28] has nu-
merically mapped out the VLT phase diagram of this
tFeSC model by conducting explicit vortex modeling, we
will, however, attempt to establish this phase diagram
with a completely different approach, exploiting only (i)
π-junction simulations and (ii) JVC relations.
The normal state of this minimal model consists of six
electron bands, as described by the basis function Ψk =
(|pz, ↑⟩, |pz, ↓⟩, |d+, ↓⟩, |d−, ↑⟩, |d+, ↑⟩, |d−, ↓⟩)T . Here,
d± is short for dxz±iyz. This effective Hamiltonian is thus
given by

htFeSC(k) preserves TRS Θ = diag[−i, i, −i] ⊗syK, spa-
tial inversion symmetry P = diag[−1, −1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and
a fourfold rotation symmetry C4z

Jz = diag[ 1

2], Mx = iI3 ⊗sx.
Our
choice of parameters are v = 0.5, vz = 0.1, b1,2 = 0,
m0 = 2m1 = −2m2 = 2, and δ = 0.5. This parameter set
ensures that the pz bands cross the bands of d-electrons
to form two consecutive band inversions along Γ-Z, as the
case in both LiFeAs and Fe(Te,Se). One band inversion
leads to Z2 topological bands that mimic the physics of a
strong TI, while the other creates a pair of C4z-protected
bulk Dirac nodes like those that can be found in a DSM.
We assume the TI gap to occur at E = 0, while the Dirac
nodes live at a higher energy E = δ. Namely, the value of
δ controls the coupling strength between the TI and DSM
bands, with δ →∞being the fully decoupling limit.
The π-junction modeling for the tFeSC system is con-
ducted in the BdG formalism with an s-wave spin-singlet
pairing potential ∆0 = 0.08 and a slab geometry compris-
ing 300 unit cells along the ˆx direction. Periodic bound-
ary conditions are applied for both ˆy and ˆz directions. In
Fig. 4 (a), we fix kz = π and plot the gap distribution of
junction-trapped Andreev bound states as a function of µ
and ky, where the red dots denote where the Andreev gap
vanishes and a JT transition takes place. Remarkably, we
find two on-TRIM JT transitions at µ(J)
c,1 = −1.05 and
µ(J)
c,3 = 1.50, as well as one off-TRIM, same kz JT critical
pair at µ(J)
c,2 = 0.25. For kz = 0, no JT phase transition
has been found.
To clarify the nature of each JT transition, we calculate
both the Z4 inversion-symmetry indicator κ and the BdG
mirror Chern number CM for Mx for all occupied states
of the π-junction. In particular, we find that
(κ, CM) =






(0, 0)
µ > 1.5,
(3, 1)
µ ∈(0.25, 1.5),
(3, −1)
µ ∈(−1.05, 0.25),
(0, 0)
µ < −1.05.
(23)
Here, we extract the value of CM by plotting the mirror-
indexed Wilson loop spectra in Figs. 4 (b) with µ = −0.1
and (c) with µ = 0.3. As expected, the off-TRIM JT
critical pair will leave κ invariant, but it can change CM
by ±2. Meanwhile, the on-TRIM JT transitions always
change the Z2 JT of the π-junction, as κ = 3 implies
ν0 = 1.
We are now ready to sketch the VLT phase diagram
based on Fig. 4 (a) and Sec. III D. This vortex phase dia-
gram should consist of five topologically distinct regions
along µ, separated by four critical points of the vortex
line at µ(v)
c,i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). Specifically,
1. We expect the on-TRIM JT transitions to induce
µ(v)
c,1 ≈−1 and µ(v)
c,4 ≈1.5. They each will represent
either a Kitaev vortex transition or a nodal vortex
transition.
