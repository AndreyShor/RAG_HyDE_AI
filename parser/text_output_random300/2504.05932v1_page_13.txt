We will not need the explicit form of these building blocks, but we need to see that they are
well defined and the limit exists. The expression is particularly worrysome as at small β we have
G+(±iβ) ∼1/√β. Additionally, the β →0 limit is not well-defined in terms of the perturbative
definition of Aα,β. This is because it is a large b expansion, and this asymptotic series is singular
for α, β →0 (see e.g. Appendix C of [22]). In order to calculate the correct small β limit of Aα,β
we have to exploit that it satisfies the Wiener–Hopf integral equation at the perturbative level,
see for instance (57,59) in [22]. The small β behaviour then can be calculated following (2.16-
2.19) of [17], which results in the form Aα,β ∼√β(b0 + b1 log(β) + . . . . Then one can explicitely
show that in the β →0 limit of (59) the square-root type singularities of G±(iβ) together with
the logarithms cancel, and the combination has a well-defined limit. We circumvent the explicit
calculations by leveraging that the limit exists, and providing a perturbative definition of Aα;ℓ
based on the ODEs (35) and (36).
In particular, we note that we can construct Aα;ℓdirectly from the leading exponential
correction in ϕα;ℓ:
ϕα;ℓ=

From the differential equation (36), we can derive a new differential equation that relates the
perturbative objects Aα;ℓ:
˙Aα;ℓ+ αAα;ℓ= aα
a0
˙A0;ℓ,
(62)
where aα was defined in (57) and (58). This equation provides a method to compute exponential
corrections to the moment ϕℓfrom its perturbative part, ϕ(0)

4
π2ℓ+1 A0;ℓ.
Using then the relationship (29) between the densities Oα,β and the moments, and applying
it to (53), we obtain

Observe that the perturbative part is simply ϕ(0)

Using (29) again, but now applying it to the densities with α ̸= 0 in (54), we might write the
analogue of (63) for the generalized moments:
