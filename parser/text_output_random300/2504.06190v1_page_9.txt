1.2 Four-dimensional no-scale models

we choose a factorised gauge kinetic function:
ef = 1
eg 2 ,
fY = aY + bY T ,
fL = aL + bL T ,
(1.15)
where (eg, aY , bY , aL, bL) are real constants. The classical potential V0 turns
out to be the sum of positive semidefinite contributions proportional to eg2
and to the field-dependent SU(2)L and U(1)Y coupling constants g ′ 2 ≡
1/(Re fY ) and g2 ≡1/(Re fL). After gauge fixing, inequivalent vacua can be
classified by ⟨H−
1 ⟩= ⟨H+
2 ⟩= 0 and
⟨T⟩= x ,
⟨H0
1⟩= ⟨H0
2⟩= 2 x v ,
(1.16)
where x > 0 and v ≥0 parametrise two real flat directions. As in [16],
the ]
U(1) gauge symmetry and supersymmetry are spontaneously broken on
flat Minkowski space at all vacua. The electroweak gauge symmetry is also
spontaneously broken on the generic vacuum, although it can be restored at
the special point v = 0. In the hidden sector, the spectrum is exactly as in
[16]. Setting here T = x (1 + t + i τ), τ is the Goldstone boson absorbed by
the massive ]
U(1) vector, and t is a canonically normalised massless scalar.
In the observable sector, the spectrum of gauge and Higgs bosons, charginos
and neutralinos corresponds to a special choice of parameters in the MSSM.
The only classically massless fields are the dilaton t in the hidden sector and
the SM Higgs boson h in the MSSM Higgs sector 4, where the masses of all
exotic scalars receive supersymmetry-breaking contributions of order m3/2.
All renormalisable interactions are exactly as in the MSSM, for a special
parameter choice, and the non-renormalisable interactions are suppressed by
inverse powers of MP . Finally, the matter sector and the strong interactions
of the MSSM can be included in the observable sector in a straightforward
way, although at the cost of some additional model dependence.
1.2.4 N = 1 non-linear realisations and inflation
No-scale models can be combined with non-linear realisations of supersym-
metry to build semi-realistic inflationary models where, at the end of infla-
tion, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken with naturally vanishing clas-
sical vacuum energy and no classically massless scalars in the spectrum. A
review of inflationary models making use of non-linear supergravity and an
extensive list of references can be found in [20]. Here [21] we recall first how,
4 A classically massless h is not a (qualitative) problem: if quantum corrections eventually
select v, a mass for h is automatically generated.
