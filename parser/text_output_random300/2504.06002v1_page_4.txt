FIG. 2. r vs. ns (upper left panel), r vs. ξ (upper right), ξ vs. ns (lower left) and λ vs. ξ (lower right) for N = 60 e-folds
in the metric (continuous) and Palatini formulation (dashed), with δ = 0.1%, δ = 1% and δ = 3% in the loop corrected
Higgs-inflation-like scenario. The gray (purple) areas represent the 1,2σ allowed regions coming from the latest combination
of Planck, BICEP/Keck and BAO data [9] (from Planck, ACT, and DESI [8]). For reference, we also plot the predictions of
quartic (brown), quadratic (orange), linear (green) and Starobinsky [2] (black) inflation in metric gravity, and, in the right
lower panel, λew ≃0.13 ( gray dashed line) i.e. the value of the Higgs-self quartic coupling at EW scale. The arrow in the
upper left panel denotes the direction of increasing ξ.
results show how and in what amount beyond standard
model (BSM) physics needs to intervene at high scale
so that the expansion in eq. (4) is still a viable approx-
imation.
For instance, it is quite common to work in
scenarios where both the Higgs self-quartic coupling and
the corresponding beta function are λH ≃βH ≃0 at MP
(e.g., [25] and references therein). In such a scenario, the
validity of eq. (4) would be all due to BSM physics.

CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have shown that by incorporating a
running self-coupling for the Higgs, the model can nat-
urally accommodate larger values of ns, bringing it into
excellent agreement with the 1σ region of the ACT data.
This effect is even more pronounced in the Palatini for-
mulation of the theory. Interestingly, we find that the
required values of the non-minimal coupling ξ are be-
low unity, in stark contrast to the large values typically
needed in conventional metric (ξ ∼104) and Palatini
(ξ ∼109) Higgs inflation, thereby pushing any potential
issues with perturbative unitarity safely above the Planck
scale. These findings suggest that quantum corrections
play a crucial role in reconciling Higgs-like inflation with
the latest observational data and motivate further ex-
ploration of radiative effects and their implications for
inflationary predictions.
