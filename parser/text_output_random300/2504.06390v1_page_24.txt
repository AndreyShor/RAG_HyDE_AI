tive features toward higher photon energies, consistent with the broadening of the polaron-
induced energy gap. Among the substrates, SiO2 and SiC again exhibit the strongest mod-
ulation, reflecting their more efficient coupling between graphene charge carriers and surface
optical phonons. Conversely, HfO2 continues to show a weaker spectral response due to its
low phonon energy despite its higher polarization parameter.
Without an applied electric field, the total relative refractive index—shown in Fig-
ure 7(a)—reveals a dispersive structure that closely resembles the linear refractive index
profile. This similarity confirms that the linear contribution dominates the overall refractive
behavior of the system, while the nonlinear component introduces only minor modifications.
As the magnetic field increases, the dispersive features become more pronounced and shift
toward higher photon energies, consistent with the enhancement of the polaron-induced en-
ergy gap. These shifts are particularly visible for SiO2 and SiC substrates, whose balanced
values of η and ℏωSO favor stronger electron-phonon coupling and thus more noticeable re-
fractive changes. The substrates h-BN and HfO2 exhibit weaker responses due to low η
or low phonon energy, respectively. While the nonlinear refractive index remains small in
magnitude, it subtly distorts the total profile, slightly altering the symmetry and slope of the
spectral features. This behavior indicates that even when small, nonlinear effects can influ-
ence light propagation characteristics in graphene-based systems under moderate magnetic
fields.
With the electric field applied (F = 0.37(b), it continues to be primarily dictated by the
linear component, but subtle field-induced modifications become evident. As in the zero-
field case, the overall spectral shape retains the dispersive character, with resonant features
shifting toward higher photon energies as the magnetic field increases. However, compared
to panel (a), these shifts are slightly enhanced in substrates exhibiting stronger polaronic
coupling, such as SiO2 and SiC. This trend indicates that while the nonlinear contribution
remains small, it becomes more influential under combined magnetic and electric fields,
subtly altering the refractive landscape. In contrast, h-BN and HfO2 show minimal change,
