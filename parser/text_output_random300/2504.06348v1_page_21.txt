Species Partitioning
We partition the degrees of freedom (electrons and nuclei) into disjoint sets, each of which forms a chemical
“species” defined by spatial proximity and chemical bonding at t = 0. For example, consider simulating a
single event of the water gas-shift (WGS) reaction
CO + H2O →H2 + CO2
(43)
on a copper catalyst, with 1 C, 2 O, 2 H, and a collection of Cu atoms. We lump all the metal Cu nuclei
and their associated electrons into one set representing the metal catalyst species, labeled s = 0. Similarly,
we lump 1 C and 1 O together representing the CO species, labeled s = 1, and lump the remaining 2 H and
1 O together representing H2O, labeled s = 2. For our purposes of a single catalyst and S reactants (e.g.
S = 2 above), we label all S + 1 species from s = 0, ..., S, where s = 0 refers to the catalyst and the rest
index the reactants. For a species s, the labels E′
s, Is denote a corresponding set of associated electrons and
nuclei, where |E′
s| = ηs
el, |Is| = ηs

Hs + HINT,
(44)
where HINT is implicitly defined by collecting all mutual interactions between different chemical species (e.g.
a reactant with another reactant, a reactant with the catalyst, etc.). We neglect interspecies interactions
HINT for the purpose of creating an initial state ansatz and further assume that all species are initially
mutually uncorrelated.
This invokes the same spirit as in the usual treatment of quantum-mechanical
scattering, wherein initial states are product states of spatially well-separated non-interacting particles,
although for efficiency purposes, we might choose to prepare species in close proximity to each other as
discussed in Sec. 2.2. Altogether, this yields a tensor product ansatz for the initial state, described by the
density operator
ρ(t = 0) = ⊗S
s=0ρs(t = 0),
(45)
where ρs(t = 0) is the initial state of species s.

Reaction geometry
Fixing a species s, for each of its constituents labeled by i ∈E′
s and I ∈Is, we move to the corresponding
center-of-mass (CoM) coordinates,

of the CoM coordinates are independent.
We choose the CoM for each species to be prepared in an isotropic minimal uncertainty Gaussian
wavepacket.
Such a wavepacket has 7 free parameters per species, 3 fixing the mean position, 3 fixing
