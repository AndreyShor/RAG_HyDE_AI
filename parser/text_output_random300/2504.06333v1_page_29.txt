Case II : Non-trivial extension
We move on to discuss the case where the two Z2’s mix non-trivially to form a Z4:
0 Ð→Z2t Ð→Z4 Ð→Z2e Ð→0.
(6.26)
In order to get a Z4, we need an additional coupling in the SymTFT action,
Sbulk = i
π ∫(a1db1 + ˜a1d˜b1 + c2db0 + c2˜b1 −1
2a1d˜b1).
(6.27)
The action is gauge invariant under (6.23) and the local equations of motion are,
˜a1 ∶d˜b1 = 0,
b1 ∶da1 = 0,
b0 ∶dc2 = 0,
c2 ∶db0 + ˜b1 = 0,
a1 ∶db1 −1
2d˜b1 = 0,
˜b1 ∶d˜a1 −1
2da1 + c2 = 0.
(6.28)
We acquire a QFT with Z4 symmetry (with a trivially acting subgroup) by im-
posing the Dirichlet boundary condition on a1, ˜a1,c2 and the Neumann boundary
condition on b1,˜b1,b0. Like before, we have a topological line operator that ends on
a point operator in the bulk, that generates the trivially acting subgroup Z2t ⊂Z4.
To see that it is in fact Z4, note that summing over the a1 gauge bundle degrees
of freedom implies that 2∮b1 −∮˜b1 ∈2πZ, and this implies that a ˜X operator
deﬁned on a loop, ˜X[φ,γ1] = exp(i∮γ1 ˜b1), will satisfy ˜X2 = X. Since X2 = 1, this
˜X operator is a generator of a Z4 symmetry.
We can gauge the Z4 symmetry by changing the boundary condition on the
symmetry boundary, produces genuine topological point operators in the bulk.
The fact that Z2’s mix non-trivially is corroborated from the fact that we can no
longer gauge Z2e like in case I. We can try to impose Dirichlet b.c. on b1, ˜a1,c2 and
Neumann b.c. on a1,˜b1,b0, which corresponds to gauging Z2e but this particular
choice of boundary conditions is no longer allowed. In order to see that we vary
the action,
δSbulk = ∫M3
(δa1db1 + a1dδb1 + δ˜a1d˜b1 + ˜a1dδ˜b1
+δc2db0 + c2dδb0 + δc2˜b1 + c2δ˜b1
−1
2δa1d˜b1 −1
2a1dδ˜b1).
