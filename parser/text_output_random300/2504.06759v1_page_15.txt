on atoms of the blue sublattice in layer J for the junctions
that host dispersing states. The dispersion relations are shown with dashed lines; these are symmetric
in energy about E = 0 but only the dispersion for E > 0 is shown, with colour differentiating between
states possessing different dispersion relations. In these results we take qy = 0.
