lines), in (a) market economy (A1), the mean 𝑐𝜇 value is smaller, and the deviation 𝑐𝜎 
value is larger than in the other economies. This is because some nodes are prioritized 
owing to the enclosure, and the difference between these and other nodes is large. In 
(b) the power economy (B1), the value of mean 𝑐𝜇 becomes larger, and the value of 
deviation 𝑐𝜎 becomes smaller than in (a) market economy (A1) due to the mitigation 
of enclosure. In (c) the gift economy (C1) and (d) the concession economy (D1), all 
nodes are treated equally, and the value of the deviation 𝑐𝜎 becomes even smaller. 
Similarly to the graph density 𝐷 shown in Fig 4, the values of the mean 𝑐𝜇 and 
deviation 𝑐𝜎 are approximately constant at 𝑡 =  200, where the total degree is limited 
by the mean degree 𝑘𝜇. The values of the mean 𝑐𝜇 and deviation 𝑐𝜎 are stable in 
contrast to the dynamic fluctuations in the mean cluster coefficient 𝐶 in Fig 4, and it is 
considered that the equality of the nodes is maintained. 
 Regarding the Gini coefficient 𝐺 (blue lines), (a) market economy (A2) has 
the highest value, and as the steps progress, the value decreases to 0.8. Wealth is 
propagated only between some nodes because of the enclosure. In (b) power economy 
(B2), the value decreases to 0.5 as the steps progress, owing to the mitigation of the 
enclosure. Incidentally, the global Gini coefficient has remained high at 0.7 over the 
years [1] and exceeded the threshold of 0.4 of the warning level for social unrest [35]. 
The values for (a) the market economy (A2) and (b) the power economy (B2) reflect 
the global situation. In contrast, in (c) the gift economy (C2) and (d) the concession 
economy (D2), all nodes are treated equally, and wealth is distributed; therefore, the 
value drops to 0.3. This value represents the level of economic health and social stability 
[35]. In addition, when comparing (c) gift economy and (d) concession economy, the 
changes in (d) concession economy are more rapid. This is because (d) the concession
