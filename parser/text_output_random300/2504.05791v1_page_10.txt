Figure 6: Angle perception results with congruent virtual sizes. Graphs show the point of subjective equality (PSE) and upscaling
and downscaling thresholds (UT and DT, respectively). The sigmoid function coefficients of each curve are provided.
For physical object 6cm-8° and 6cm-16° with different physical
angles, we fitted four lines (link the 2 points on each line) for the
vertices 𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒
𝑆𝑈𝑇×𝐴𝑈𝑇, 𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒
𝑆𝐷𝑇×𝐴𝑈𝑇, 𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒
𝑆𝑈𝑇×𝐴𝐷𝑇and 𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒
𝑆𝐷𝑇×𝐴𝐷𝑇.
For physical objects (1, 2 and 3) with different sizes, the illusion
space for size perception becomes smaller when the physical size
is larger, while the angle perception isn’t obviously influenced.
The change of size perception with physical sizes has also shown
the same pattern in the resized grasping study[6]. On the other
hand, the illusion space area of angle perception decreases when
the physical taper angle is larger, as shown in Fig. 8b. Although
physical sizes and taper angles are different properties with different
units, their influence can be compared in terms of application (i.e.
the influence of changing 1 cm on the sizes and changing 1° on
the taper angles. According to the results of Fig. 8a and Fig. 8b,
changing physical sizes has more influence on the size and
angle perception thresholds than changing physical taper
angles.
Our results show that as the physical size increases, the size of
the resultant illusion space decreases. On the one hand, this could be
seen as a violation of Weber’s law, which states that as the intensity
of a stimulus increases, so too does the JND (i.e., you need a larger
step change in stimulus to perceive a difference) [18]. However,
Smeets et al. have proposed that the size should not be seen as
the property of stimuli to be examined in Weber’s law in grasping
tasks [48]. Instead, according to Smeets et al., for different object
sizes the stimuli actually are the finger positions when grasping
with simultaneous visual feedback, while the size perception can
only be estimated in delayed grasping where the subjects remember
the size information. Similarly to Utz et al. [52], we would argue
that the stimuli is likely a complex function of joint positions, grip
forces, friction, and visual feedback. Our working hypothesis is
that the illusion space is smaller for larger items as you are towards
the maximum aperture of the finger joints nearer the hand, which
provides a clearer perceptual starting point for assessing the size
of an object (i.e., we know that our own maximum aperture is
approximately 12cm, for example, providing a starting point for
size perception). Understanding and evaluating this hypothesis
remains an interesting avenue for future work.
