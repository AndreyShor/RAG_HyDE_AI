librium is assumed for seismic solar models. To achieve this, we ensure that the luminosity at
0.3R⊙matches the solar luminosity. Inspections of solar models show a plateau in the luminos-
ity proﬁle at 0.3R⊙that corresponds to the surface value within 0.1%. Physically, this implies
that above this limit, energy generated in the core by nuclear reactions is simply transported
outward.
Achieving this involves parametrizing the chemical composition proﬁle below 0.3R⊙to ﬁnd
a solution matching the energy generation of the evolutionary model. The chemical proﬁle’s
parametrization is discussed below, and the minimization procedure is rigorously constrained
to avoid solutions with unphysical chemical composition gradients and signiﬁcant deviations
from the evolutionary model. At 0.3R⊙, the chemical composition proﬁle precisely aligns with
that of the evolutionary model. Consequently, above this limit, it remains unaffected by core
region parametrization and is solely determined by evolutionary computations.
This second reconstruction step is based on equation
dL
dr = 4πr2ρǫ(ρ, T, X, Z),
(8)
with L the luminosity, ρ the density of the seismic model, X and Z coming from the parametriza-
tion, T the temperature proﬁle given by the equation of state and ǫ is the energy generation rate
of nuclear reactions, which is computed from the nuclear energy generation routines of the
Li`ege stellar evolution code. The contribution from gravity, ǫg is less than 0.1% and thus negli-
gible.
As noted by Gough (2004)83, the reproduction of the solar luminosity by the seismic model
depends on the amount of helium in the core. Thus, the chemical composition of the core is
iterated so that the model reproduces the luminosity plateau observed around 0.3R⊙. Previous
approaches in Gough & Scherrer (2001)92, Gough (2004)83 changed the global core helium
content, or assumed a constant metallicity in the solar interior93;94 to provide a unique solution
