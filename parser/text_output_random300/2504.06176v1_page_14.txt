A Self-Supervised Framework for Space Object Behaviour Characterisation.

Awareness pipelines they become an attractive target for ad-
versarial attack, particularly through data poisoning. For this
reason, ensuring the integrity of data provenance is highly im-
portant, and blockchain approaches could be used here, treating
the dataset as the transaction to be verified on the public ledgers,
e.g., through the use of Trustchain [23].
A substantial challenge direction for further development is
multi-modal fusion - i.e., integrating the light curve analysis
presented here with other observation types (e.g., hyperspec-
tral data, orbits, radar etc.) Indeed, part of the decision to use
a Perceiver based architecture was to readily enable extension
to other data modalities, as it is well suited to this through its
cross-attention and latent bottleneck design, which could en-
able multiple modalities to be reduced to a common set of em-
beddings. However, there are substantial technical challenges
in multimodal fusion, including developing an appropriate fu-
sion strategy at different levels of the pre-training/fine-tuning
pipeline. One such method to fuse information from other sen-
sors with light curves could include implementation of con-
trastive learning using paired observations. For example, pos-
itive pairs (same space object at different dates) and negative
pairs (different objects on the same date) would help develop
more discriminative features for space object characterisation.
Additionally incorporating metadata prediction tasks as part of
the self-supervised framework could help capture characteris-
tic signatures of specific satellites, or debris. For example, a
fine-tuned metadata prediction FM could generate a likely light
curve given an orbital eccentricity, which could help unpick the
relationships between satellite structure/behaviour and orbital
path.
Our initial framework provides promising results, and as the
amount of data available increases, a basis for further analysis.
We suggest foundation Models could become powerful tools
for automated space object monitoring and space situational
awareness. As orbital populations continue to grow, automated
approaches such as ours will become increasingly crucial for
maintaining space safety & sustainability.
