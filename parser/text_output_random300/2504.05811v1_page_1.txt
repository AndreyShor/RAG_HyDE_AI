Our previous studies revealed evidence of the strange molecular partners of Pc states,
N(2080)3/2−and N(2270)3/2−, in the γp →K∗+Σ0/K∗0Σ+ and γp →ϕp reactions.
Motivated by the differential cross-section data for γp →K+Σ0 from CLAS 2010, which
exhibits some bump structures at W ≈1875, 2080 and 2270 MeV, we extend our previous
analysis by investigating the effects of N(1535)1/2−, N(1875)3/2−, N(2080)1/2−& 3/2−
and N(2270)1/2−, 3/2−& 5/2−, as strange partners of Pc molecular states, in the reactions
γp →K+Σ0 and γp →K0Σ+. The theoretical model employed in this study utilizes an
effective Lagrangian approach in the tree-level Born approximation. It contains the contri-
butions from s-channel with exchanges of N, ∆, N ∗(including the hadronic molecules with
hidden strangeness), and ∆∗; t-channel; u-channel; and the generalized contact term. The
results corresponding to the final fitted parameters are in good agreement with all available
experimental data of both cross-sections and polarization observables for γp →K+Σ0 and
γp →K0Σ+. Notably, the s-channel exchanges of molecules significantly contribute to the
bump structures in cross-sections for γp →KΣ at W ≈1900, 2080 and 2270 MeV, and show
considerable coherence with contributions from s-channel exchanges of general resonances to
construct the overall structures of cross-sections. More abundant experiments, particularly
for the reaction γp →K0Σ+, are necessary to further strengthen the constraints on the
theoretical models.

INTRODUCTION
The several Pc states observed by the LHCb experiment in 2015 and later [1, 2] are the most
convincing multiquark candidates, prompting significant interest in investigating their nature [3–
5]. In the hadronic molecular picture, the Pc(4312) can be interpreted as a narrow DΣc bound
