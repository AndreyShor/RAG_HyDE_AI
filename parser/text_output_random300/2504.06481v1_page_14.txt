this section we obtain an analogous brane description of the trivial and low-lying representations,
by considering a (p, q) fivebrane in the same cavity background. This brane configuration plays
a similar role to the fivebrane in the BMN model [21]. We will first present the solution and
afterwards discuss its regime of validity in relation to the supergravity solutions.
The cavity background [1] has a constant NSNS three-form field strength
H3 = µ dx8 ∧dx9 ∧dx10 ,
(36)
where µ is a parameter that is proportional to Ωin the matrix description. The dilaton, axion
and string frame metric are given by

This background is very similar to the IIA geometry obtained by dimensional reduction of the
BMN plane wave [22]. We are using a convention where the factors of gs are part of the back-
ground fields and do not appear in the action explicity. This will make the duality transformations
we perform shortly more transparent.
A probe D1-brane can be added to the cavity background, preserving all symmetries and
supersymmetries. The brane forms an S2 with radius r2 ≡P10
a=8 x2
a, sitting at the origin in the
other directions, and carries a worldvolume Maxwell flux F given by [1]
r = 3
4πα′µN ,
F = 1
2NvolS2 .
(38)
The D1-brane sources N units of D-instanton charge, via the
´
C0F worldvolume coupling, and
ND1 = 1 unit of electric RR flux through the S7 transverse to the brane, via the
´
C2 world-
volume coupling. It therefore has both the charge and the geometry of the maximal irreducible
representation. The D5 and NS5 charges in this case can only be seen after backreacting the
brane on the spacetime.
To obtain a brane description of other representations, we will now place a (p, q) fivebrane
in the cavity background. Such a configuration has NNS5 = q. While our main interest is in the
trivial representation, with q = 1, it is instructive to consider this more general case. The D5
charge p is unfixed at this point. To write down the brane action, following the logic of Polchinski
and Strassler [23], we will perform the SL(2, Z) transformation (see [1] for more on SL(2, Z) in
Euclidean type IIB), where F3 is the RR three-form field strength,
eC0 ± e−eϕ = a(C0 ± e−ϕ) + b
−q(C0 ± e−ϕ) + p ,

with ap + bq = 1. Integer solutions for a and b exist whenever p and q are coprime, which
is sufficient for our purposes. This transformation maps the (p, q) fivebrane to a single probe
D5-brane in a transformed cavity background. It is straightforward to obtain eH3, eF3, eC0 and
e−eϕ from (39) in terms of the original background (36) and (37). This original background has
