Table 1:
Extrapolation results for the energies (in MeV) of the 6He and 6Li ground
states and the lowest excited states in 6Li obtained using the largest training dataset
(N u
max = 18) in comparison with the variational minimum obtained in the NCSM calcu-
lations at Nmax = 18, with phenomenological extrapolation B [4], with machine learning
approaches ISU-a of Ref. [11] and ISU-b [16] utilizing a smaller range of ℏΩvalues for
training, with extrapolation TUDa using universal ensemble of neural networks [16], and
with experiment [30]. The symmetric uncertainties of the last presented digits are given
in parentheses while asymmetric uncertainties are given in super and subscripts.
3. Results
The 6Li nucleus is of particular interest since its ground state energy and
rms point-proton radius rp have been studied using the machine learning
extrapolation in the pioneering work [11]. Moreover, the training datasets
obtained in the NCSM calculations with the Daejeon16 NN interaction were
utilized in our study and in Ref. [11] as well as in a recent investigation of
Ref. [16] which benchmarks two diﬀerent approaches to the neural network
training, one is the approach of Ref. [11] and the other is the approach devel-
oped in Refs. [14, 15]. There are key diﬀerences between these approaches:
Ref. [11] suggests training an ensemble of artiﬁcial neural networks for each
observable in each particular nucleus while the Refs. [14, 15] suggest an en-
semble of universal networks for a set of nuclei trained on a particular ob-
servable in lightest nuclei. The approach of Ref. [11] is close to ours, however,
there are essential diﬀerences including the neural network topology, selection
criteria for trained networks, and several other methodological aspects.
The extrapolated energy values for the 6He ground state and a few lowest
states in 6Li, along with their associated uncertainties, are summarized in
Table 1. For comparison, we present in Table 1 the results obtained by the
phenomenological exponential extrapolation B [4], by the machine learning
extrapolation approach of Ref. [11] (ISU-a), by the same approach utiliz-
