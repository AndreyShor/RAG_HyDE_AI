At the same time, the successful attacks on the Ukrainian power
grid in 2015 and 2016, as well as the attempted attack in 2022, un-
derscore the devastating impact of such incidents and highlight the
interest of powerful adversaries exploiting these weaknesses [28].
Meanwhile, the German Federal Office for Information Security
(BSI) reported over 200 cyber incidents against the Germany energy
sector between 2023 and 2024 [13, 14].
With this paper, we introduce Sherlock, a comprehensive dataset
specifically designed for process-aware, as well as network-based,
intrusion detection. Sherlock was recorded using the co-simulator
Wattson [6], which can simulate power grids while concurrently
emulating their corresponding Information and Communication
Technologies (ICT) networks. Wattson has been validated against
a physical power grid, ensuring its accuracy, and supports both em-
ulated network components and hardware-in-the-loop integration.
Furthermore, it provides a safe research environment for replicat-
ing both routine operations and real-world cyberattacks. These
features make it an ideal tool for collecting representative, diverse,
and reproducible datasets for intrusion detection research.
We passively capture network traffic from critical vantage points
across three scenarios (denoted as 01-Basic, 02-Semiurban, and
03-Rural) during simulations spanning 35 days. For two networks,
we provide labeled attack-free and attack datasets, while for the
third, only attack data is available. This approach promotes research
into the generalizability and transferability of detection methods, a
critical goal given the expense and complexity of retraining intru-
sion detection systems with clean training data for each network.
Captured traffic is post-processed using the IPAL toolset [30] to
generate time-series data representing the system’s physical state.
This abstraction layer enhances dataset accessibility and decouples
it from region-specific communication protocols.
The IPAL representation enables us to evaluate the detection
performance of five IIDSs [4, 12, 18, 29, 31], which claim domain
generalizability. This evaluation reveals six challenges in power
grid networks that current process-aware intrusion detection mech-
anisms struggle to address, ranging from handling thousands of
data points to accommodating long-term process variations.

Related Work
Conti et al. [9] identifies 23 public datasets for cybersecurity re-
search in ICS networks. However, most lack process data and some
rely on IIDSs explicitly learning from captured attack samples,
which limits their ability to detect novel attacks or variations [19].
Among these, only five datasets of decent quality incorporate pro-
cess data, yet none represent power grid scenarios at realistic scales.
The SWaT dataset [16] captures process data from a scaled-
down water treatment plant, featuring 36 physical attacks exe-
cuted as machine-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks over 11 days. Its
single-execution attacks and focus on physical modifications limit
its generalizability. The WADI dataset [1] focuses on water distri-
bution, incorporating 14 attacks over 16 days with more physical
measurement points but fewer process stages than SWaT. Similarly,
the BATADAL dataset [26], based on a simulated water distribution
network, samples data at hourly intervals, spanning a year with
14 attacks but offering coarser granularity. The HAI dataset [24]
covers different stages of power generation processes. It features 50
diverse attacks of varying complexity. Finally, the EPIC dataset [2]
focuses on a small power grid scenario with data collected from
Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) monitoring electrical param-
eters. While it includes both network and process data, its attack
scenarios are limited to malicious reconfigurations of devices.
Current datasets in the power grid domain [2, 8, 32] focus on
network-based attacks and do either not include attacks against
the physical process or do not even accurately reflect the physical
process. Thus, large-scale power grid scenarios are not covered
by existing datasets. Moreover, there remains a general lack of
datasets that combine both network and process data, feature com-
plex, multi-stage attacks, and are grounded in realistic, scalable
scenarios. Sherlock should fill this gap.

The Sherlock Dataset
The Sherlock dataset aims to address gaps left by existing datasets,
providing a valuable resource for assessing intrusion detection
methods in power grids. Beyond this goal, Sherlock is designed
to support broader research into power grid cybersecurity and the
practical deployment of IIDSs in realistic network environments.
The following sections detail our testbed setup and provide an in-
depth overview of the Sherlock dataset. Additional information is
available on the Sherlock website at https://sherlock.wattson.it/.

Testbed Setup
The backbone of our testbed is the Wattson simulator [6]. Watt-
son is an open-source power grid co-simulator, i.e., it emulates
realistic network traffic among power grid devices while simu-
lating the power grid. Wattson uses PowerOwl [5] to model the
power grid, which offers steady-state power flow calculations based
on pandapower [27] and emulates its communication network sup-
porting switches, routers, and hosts with lightweight namespaces,
based on Docker containers, and with virtual machines in Linux.
Wattson uses tc for traffic control to configure delays, jitter, band-
width, and packet-loss for each individual link. The communication
between the control center and substations is performed using the
IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC 104) protocol.
For our scenarios, we focus on future-oriented settings with a
significant fraction of substations being digitized, i.e., they digitally
transmit measurements and—if applicable—support the remote exe-
cution of control commands. For each scenario, we include load and
optional generation profiles to control the behavior of these assets
during the evaluation. Wattson performs a real-time co-simulation
with a 14x accelerated power profile, i.e., evaluating 12 h of network
traffic reflects the power generation and usage patterns over an en-
tire week. To reduce complexity, we abstract from protective relays
as intrusion detection should alert before they trigger. The Sher-
lock dataset is composed of network captures from mirror ports at
switches that were identified as key vantage points, enriched with
logs from individual hosts and services, additional context informa-
tion, process ground-truth information, control center events, and
documentation. Our online documentation presents the details of
the different scenarios, vantage points, and grid values.
For Sherlock, we extract all relevant information passively,
aligning with a non-invasive deployment strategy well-suited for
real-world power grid networks. The alternative of active polling
