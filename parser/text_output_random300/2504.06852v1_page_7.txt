FIG. 3: Waterfall plot of the change of the magnon
energy photoconductivity with optical frequency under
different relaxation times, where the optical frequency is
in about infrared range. Here, we take J = 1 meV,
D = 0.32 meV, S = 1 and gJµBBz = −3 meV. The
waterfall plot describe the real part of longitudinal
magnon energy photoconductivity (a), the imaginary
part of longitudinal magnon energy photoconductivity
(b), the real part of transverse magnon energy
photoconductivity (c) and the imaginary part of
transverse magnon energy photoconductivity (d).
B.
The topological controlling of magnon
photo-transport
When we can ignore the scattering of magnons in the
material, we can assume that the relaxation time of
magnons tends to infinity, that is, Γ →0. As discussed
in Subsec. II D, under the condition of low optical fre-
quency and zero Γ, the magnon spin photoconductivity
satisfies Eq. 18, and the magnon energy photoconduc-
tivity satisfies Eq. 22. Here, Eq. 18 makes it possible to
control the magnon spin photoconductivity through the
topological property of the magnon system, but Eq. 22
do not. Next, to discuss the topological control of the
magnon photo-transport under the condition of low opti-
cal frequency and Γ = 0. We take a model calculation of
Eq. 18 on Hexagonal lattice and Kagome lattice in this
subsection.
We take LP light, and we orient the direction of the LP
light along the x-axis. According to Eq. 17, for the trans-
verse magnon photo-transport (j(1)
y
and jE(1)
y
), the parts
of intraband and interband are both not zero. However,
for the longitudinal magnon photo-transport (j(1)
x
and
jE(1)
x
), under the relation εn(k) = εn(−k), the intraband
part of magnon transport is zero, leaving only the inter-
band part. So we only consider magnon photo-transport
in the x direction induced by LP light in the x direction
(longitudinal transport) in this subsection. According to
Eq. 18 and Eq. 22, in the case discussed in this sub-
section, the longitudinal magnon spin photoconductivity
and the longitudinal magnon energy photoconductivity
are purely imaginary. So according to Eq. 25, under the
LP light along x-axis, the magnon photo-transport along
x-axis can be expressed as
jLP (E)(1)

(ω) = Im
h
χ(E)
xx (ω)
i
sin(ωt)E0,x
= −iE0,xχ(E)e
xx (ω) sin(ωt).
(31)
Here, jLP (E)(1)
x
(ω) has the form of a sinusoidal function.
The amplitude of the electric field E0,x and χ(E)e
xx (ω)
determine the magnitude of jLP (E)(1)
x
(ω), and the op-
tical frequency determines the oscillation frequency of
jLP (E)(1)
x
(ω).
1.
Hexagonal model
Firstly, as shown in Fig. 1 (a), we consider a model
with the Hexagonal lattice.
After the linear Holstein–Primakoff transform and
Fourier transform, the Hamiltonian of Hexagonal lattice
can be written as42,43,69
ˆH =
X
k
ˆΦ†(k)H(k)ˆΦ(k)
(32)
in which
ˆΦ(k) = (ˆak,ˆbk)T ,
H(k) =

∆+ D(k)
−3JSγk
−3JSγ−k ∆−D(k)

= d0 + d(k) · σ. (33)
Here,
∆

γk

.
And σ = (σx, σy, σz). So d0 = ∆, dx = −3JSRe [γk],
dy = 3JSIm [γk], and dz = D(k).
So the energy of
mgnon bands is
ε±(k) = d0 ± |d(k)|,
(34)
in which |d(k)| =
q
d2x + d2y + d2z. And the correspond-
ing Bloch state can be expressed as
|u±(k)⟩=
1
p
2|d|2 ∓2|d|dz

−dx + idy
dz ∓|d|

.
(35)
Because of the inversion symmetry of the Hexagonal
model, and the magnon bands satisfy εn(k) = εn(−k),
the Bose distribution satisfy f B
n (k) = f B
n (−k). So the
intraband part of longitudinal magnon spin (energy) pho-
toconductivity is zero.
