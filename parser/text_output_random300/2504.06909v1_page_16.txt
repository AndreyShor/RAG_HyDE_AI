changes in the structure of the overturning cells. This is particularly the case in the subtropics,
where the maximum in eddy transport changes (at approximately 30◦) is much stronger than in the
interactive-SST runs. As a result, the net energy convergence integrated over the subtropical and
mid-latitude regions is much larger too (Fig. 6).
Below, we relate the energy transport changes described above to radiative budget changes,
which can in turn be interpreted in terms of changes in physical fields such as temperature and
atmospheric moisture content.
b. Radiative budget changes and their relation to temperature and humidity
Writing the zonally- and time-averaged energy balance at a given latitude enables us to link
TOA radiative fluxes 𝑅(positive downwards) to the meridional energy flux introduced above.
The energy balance for a volume of air with infinitesimal meridional extent can be written as:
𝑅≡𝐹SW −OLR = ∇· [vMSE] −𝐹sfc, where 𝐹SW is the net incoming shortwave radiation, OLR
is the outgoing longwave radiation, and 𝐹sfc is the net upward surface energy flux. We do not
consider shortwave flux changes here, as they empirically prove to be negligible. It follows that

−𝛿(𝐹sfc).

For the interactive-SST runs, surface energy balance imposes that the changes in surface flux
vanish, 𝛿(𝐹sfc) = 0, because they must always equilibrate to the prescribed ocean heat transport;
in this case, the TOA radiative changes exactly balance the meridional energy flux convergence
changes. However, this need not be the case in the fixed-SST runs where the surface fluxes are not
constrained by energy balance.
We show in Figure 7 the TOA radiative budget changes (black line) in the interactive-SST runs
(panel a), in the fixed-SST runs (the radiative forcing, panel b) and the difference between the
two (i.e., the feedbacks, panel c). The meridional structure of the TOA radiative changes in the
interactive-SST runs is, as expected, in agreement with the analysis of the energy transport changes:
the excess of energy transport in the deep tropics (between 10◦S and 10◦N) and in the mid- and
high-latitudes (poleward of 40◦) is balanced by increased OLR, while the opposite holds in a broad
subtropical region (between 10◦and 40◦). The net TOA radiative budget changes (panel a) are
