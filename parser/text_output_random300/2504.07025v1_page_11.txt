6. Neural Radiance Field
Neural implicit surface.
We apply the neural volume
rendering framework to represent implicit surfaces and fol-
low VolSDF [33] to parameterize the density values with
the transformation of an SDF. For each pixel, we sample N
points along the camera ray and approximate the color ˆC
by:
  \
h
a
t {C} = \sum _{i=1}^N w_i c_i, \label {eq:volsdf_1} 
w
(13)
  \text {with}~w_i = T_i \left ( 1 - \exp (-\sigma _i \delta _i) \right ), ~T_i = \exp \left ( -\sum _{j=1}^{i-1} \sigma _j \delta _j \right ), \label {eq:volsdf_2} w
(14)
where wi is the weight of rendering, σi and ci denote the
density and color at each sampled point i on the ray, and δi
is the distance between adjacent samples. The density is de-
fined as Laplace’s cumulative distribution function applied
to a signed distance d, as follows:
  \s i

(15)
Herein, β is a learnable parameter during network train-
ing. In practice, we use MLPs to take 3D coordinates as
input and output the corresponding signed distance as well
as a global geometric feature vector. Referring to Eq. 15,
the estimated SDFs are transformed to density values for
volumetric integration of Eq. 14.
Decomposed radiance fields.
The outgoing radiance c of
a sampled point x on the camera ray can be decomposed
into diffuse radiance cd and specular radiance cs, respec-
tively, as follows:
  c ^d = f_\ th e ta (\ mathbf  {b},  \m a t hbf {x}), \; c^s = g_\theta (\mathbf {b}, \mathbf {IDE}(\eta , \omega _r)), \; \text {and} \; c = \gamma (c^d + c^s), \label {eq:rad_decomp} 
(16)
where fθ(·) and gθ(·) denote MLPs with learnable param-
eters, and b is the geometric feature vector as mentioned
above. Following the representations in Eq. 19, the diffuse
surfaces should satisfy the property of Lambertian, thus cd
in fact is only a function of position. However, for spatially-
varying specular effects, following Verbin et al. [27], the ra-
diance has strong correlations with surface roughness η and
the reflective direction of light ωr. With integrated direc-
tional encoding (IDE), the directions are encoded with a set
of spherical harmonics, which enables the network to better
reason about the inherent properties of the material. Finally,
the diffuse and specular components are combined together
with a fixed tone mapping function γ.
7. Polarimetric BRDF Model
In this work, we only consider linear polarization and build
a scalable setup for the polarization image acquisition. To
provide a clearer understanding of how polarization infor-
mation is utilized in our method, We begin by presenting in
the following the fundamental concepts.
Stokes vector.
The polarization state of light is often char-
acterized by the Stokes vector s, which is usually computed
by taking a series of measurements with different rotation
angles, for example, polarized images with four different
polarizing angles 0◦, 45◦, 90◦and 135◦, represented by I0,
I45, I90 and I135:
  \mat hbf  {s } = [ s_0 , s_1, s_ 2 ,s_3 ]^T  = [\m ath bf {I}_0+\mathbf {I}_{90},\mathbf {I}_0-\mathbf {I}_{90},\mathbf {I}_{45}-\mathbf {I}_{135},0]^T. \label {eq:comp_stokes} 
(17)
Mueller matrix.
Any change of the polarization state due
to the interaction with optical elements, such as linear polar-
izers or object surfaces, can be denoted as a multiplication
of the corresponding Stokes vector with a Mueller matrix
M ∈R4×4. The incident and outgoing Stokes vector, rep-
resented by sin and sout, respectively, are related by
  \l a bel {eq:mueller} \mathbf {s}^\text {out} = \mathbf {M} \mathbf {s}^\text {in}. 
(18)
For surface reflection, considering the distant incident
illumination Li, which is commonly assumed to be un-
polarized, its corresponding Stokes vector is denoted as
si = Li[1, 0, 0, 0]T . Based on the pBRDF model proposed
by Baek et al. [1], the Mueller matrix can be decomposed as
the sum of diffuse component Md and specular component
Ms, i.e., M = Md + Ms. Therefore, the outgoing Stokes
vector can be reformulated as follows:
  \r e siz e box {0 . 92\hsi z e

(19)
In essence, Md and Ms depend on surface albedo, sur-
face normals, refractive index, and lighting conditions. In
short, n, i, and o represent surface normal, incident and out-
going light direction, respectively. kd is the diffuse albedo,
ks is the specular albedo, T and R are the Fresnel transmis-
sion and reflection coefficients. Refer to Baek et al. [1] for
