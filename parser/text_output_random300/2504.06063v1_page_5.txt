In the previous two sets of equations, as already done in
the case of the form-factors, we have used the compact
notation
Y(i) ≡Y(i)(ω0, ω2) ,
i = 1, · · · , 5 .
(15)
By relying on the form-factors decomposition of Eq. (10),
and by working out the phase-space kinematical con-
straints in the rest-frame of the Ds meson, Eq. (7) can
be rewritten as

By using Eqs. (14) this quantity can also be expressed
in terms of the independent components of the hadronic
tensor, i.e. in terms of the distributions Y(i)(ω0, ω2).
The integration limits to be used in Eq. (16) are given

An important rˆole in deriving Eq. (18) is played by the
exclusive process in which the Ds meson decays into the
lightest possible hadronic state in each channel, that we
call P ¯
F G. In all channels the lightest state is the QCD-
stable pseudoscalar meson corresponding to the isolated
single-particle eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian H with the
given flavor. In the case of Γ¯cs the lightest state P¯ss is
the neutral pion. In the case of Γ¯cd the lightest state P¯sd
is a neutral kaon. In the case of Γ¯us the lightest state
P¯uc is a neutral D meson and, since mDs < mD + mπ,
the “inclusive” channel Ds 7→X¯ucℓ¯νℓis in fact identical
to the exclusive channel Ds 7→Dℓ¯νℓ.
The parameter r ¯
F G appearing in Eq. (18) is
r ¯
F G = mP ¯
F G

,
(19)
i.e. the mass mP ¯
F G of the lightest state P ¯
F G in units of
mDs and, therefore,
r¯ss = mπ
mDs
,
r¯sd = mK
mDs
,
r¯uc = mD
mDs
.
(20)
An important remark is now in order. In order to fully
take into account the exclusive processes Ds 7→P ¯
F Gℓ¯νℓ
in the calculation of Γ ¯
fg the integration limits ωmin
¯
F G and
|ω|max
¯
F G , which are in fact the energy and the maximum
allowed spatial momentum of P ¯
F G in units of mDs, have
to be understood as

with ϵ a small positive number. Indeed, as we are go-
ing to explain at the end of the section, the contribution
of the exclusive processes Ds 7→P ¯
F Gℓ¯νℓto the differen-
tial decay rate, being associated with the isolated single-
particle eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian in the given flavor
channel, can be separated from the multi-particle contri-
