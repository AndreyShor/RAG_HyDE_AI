appreciable holes filled in the first layer (L1) as well (see Fig. 2l), which makes the 
carrier concentration in the topmost layer increase (bottom panel of Fig. 2j). As a result, 
the ABCB stacking appears to be brighter and brighter relative to ABAC stacking, 
which explains the observed trend in SNOM with hole doping in Figs. 2e to 2h and Fig. 
2i. We note that our DFT calculations in Figs. 2k&2l do not take the gating field-
 
 
Fig. 3. DW sliding in polar stackings by electrical gating. a-e, SNOM images capturing 
sliding motions of two different types of DWs confined at different interfaces when gated. 
Two different types of DWs are indicated by the green and blue dashed lines, respectively, 
in (a-e). The corresponding sliding directions of the two types of DWs are indicated by the 
blue and green arrows in (a-e). The DW sliding motion (indicated by the blue dashed line) 
enlarges the polar ABAC stacking at the expense of polar ABCB; meanwhile it enlarges the 
nonpolar ABAB stackings at the expense of ABCA stackings on the left and right of the two 
adjacent polar stackings. The DW sliding motion (indicated by the green dashed line) 
enlarges the nonpolar ABAB and ABCA stackings at the expense of polar ABCA and ABCB 
stackings, respectively. The scale bar in (a) is 1 Âµm (same scale in (a-e)). f, A schematic 
reproducing the DW sliding motion and domain patterns observed in (a-e). g, Schematic 
illustration of the blue DW motion in (f), corresponding to sliding the bottom two layers 
together relative to the top two layers. h, Schematic illustration of the green DW motion in 
(f), corresponding to sliding the bottom layer alone. i, Calculated total energies for ABAB, 
ABCA, ABAC and ABCB stackings and energy barriers for four switching pathways 
observed in (a-e).
