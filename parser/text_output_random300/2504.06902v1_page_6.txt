tematic error, and the success probability γsuc reduced.
Finally, error correction and privacy amplification can be
applied independently to each pair of users/keys, just as
in a typical QKD protocol.

Bases Match
In the combined protocol of Section IV, the Bases
Match scenario (excluding detection Types 3 and 4) con-
tributes to 1/4 of the key sequence for each pair of users.
When treated as an independent protocol, the probabil-
ities of successful detection and erroneous outcomes are
shown in Fig. 4. The security proof for the Bases Match
protocol would require an extension of the proofs in [6] to
accommodate three users. This extension is quite com-
plex, as it would require treating the protocol as a QCKA
protocol [12].
However, we have deliberately structured the proto-
col (see Tables I-II, IV-V) so that systematic errors only
affect the bit strings of users B1 and B2, with user A serv-
ing as the reference. If we focus solely on the systematic
error and exclude other sources of noise or eavesdropping
on Alice’s signal, the error correction and hashing proce-
dures from [11] can be applied to mitigate the impact of
this systematic error. Under this assumptionthat Alice’s
signal experiences no noise or eavesdroppingthe formula
in [11] can also be used to estimate the SKR for this part
of the protocol.

DISCUSSION
In this work, we developed a QKD protocol designed
to serve three users in a pairwise manner. The protocol
is built upon the MDI framework, offering several ad-
vantages, including its centralized configuration with a
central MU and a star topology for the users.
A key
benefit of our protocol is that it significantly reduces the
discard rate caused by bases mismatchby almost a fac-
tor of twowhen compared to a straightforward approach
involving three separate MUs.
However, several open questions remain. The comple-
tion of the security proof for the protocol is still pending,
and further investigation is needed to assess its resilience
against noise, detector imperfections, and other practi-
cal limitations. Additionally, it would be valuable to ex-
plore whether this protocol can be simplified or extended
to accommodate more users, or if the single-MU design
presents any inherent bottlenecks. These aspects provide
important directions for future research in the develop-
ment of scalable and secure QKD protocols.
Appendix A: Bases Mismatch: tables for (YXY,
XYX) and (XYY, YXX) bases triplets
In the main text we provide the Tables I-II, for XXY,
YYX, XXX and YYY bases triplets. In Tables IV-V we
provide the information for the rest of the triplets. The
calculations have been performed using basic elements of
quantum optics [13].
