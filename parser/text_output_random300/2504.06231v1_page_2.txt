graph featurization. As shown in Figure 1, such models are highly scalable—often more than
10x faster and with 8x lower memory footprint than alternative MLIPs, whilst still enjoying
excellent performance when trained on large ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) datasets
such as OMAT24.

Pareto Frontier
Figure 1: The Pareto frontier for a range of universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials.
The 𝐾𝑆𝑅𝑀𝐸metric assesses a model’s ability to predict thermal conductivity via the Wigner
formulation of heat transport [31] and requires accurate geometry optimizations as well as
second and third order derivatives of the PES (computed via finite differences). The y-axis
measure a model’s forward passes per second on a dense periodic system of 1000 atoms,
disregarding graph construction time, measured on a NVIDIA H200. Point sizes represent max
GPU memory usage. Y-axis jitter (+/- 5 steps/second) has been applied to allow visualization
of overlapping points. Model families include a range of specific models with broadly the
same architecture, but may be different sizes or trained on different datasets. More details are
provided in Appendix K.
