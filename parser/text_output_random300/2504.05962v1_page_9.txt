 
 
cores. This aligns with our expectation because the 
approach is designed to detect unusual profiles as 
anomalies. 
Unlike inversion techniques, which extract physical 
parameters from Stokes profiles to analyze the flare 
formation mechanism, our approach focuses on 
detecting and evaluating direct spectral shapes. This 
method accelerates the process of identifying flare-
prone regions and provides a complementary tool for 
conventional approaches.  
In conclusion, we developed a 1D-convolutional 
autoencoder-based compression model to detect 
anomalous Stokes V spectra from Hinode/SP data, with 
the goal of identifying potential flare-triggering points 
in the early stages before flare onset. Our results 
demonstrate that the model effectively identifies spectra 
with complex and unusual profiles in pre-flare spectro-
polarimetric maps, collected 3 to 24 hours before flare 
initiation. The distinct shapes and locations of these 
spectra suggest that they are likely associated with 
magnetic energy storage and flare-prone regions. Our 
approach, which seeks to detect atypical spectral 
patterns as an early alert for upcoming flare events, 
holds promise for advancing solar spectral analysis and 
for supporting methods to predict solar flares. In future 
work, we aim to extend the detection method to apply it 
to the full Stokes spectra, enabling more sophisticated 
analysis and providing more reliable predictions.
