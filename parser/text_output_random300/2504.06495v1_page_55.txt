Proof of Theorem 4.
# Shift the process: Let Yτ := Xτ −log(ǫ), so that Yτ evolves
on [0, ∞) and satisﬁes
dYτ = −µ dτ + σ dWτ,
with absorption at 0.
# Doob’s h-transform: To condition on survival, we apply Doob’s h-transform (see e.g.
Karatzas and Shreve 1991, Chapter 5.4) using a positive harmonic function h solving L h = 0,
where L = −µ d
dy + σ2

dy2 is the inﬁnitesimal generator of Yτ.
The exponential function
h(y) = e

σ2 y satisﬁes this equation.
# Conditioned process and its stationary distribution: Under the h-transform, the
conditioned process has generator
Lhf(y) = µ d
dyf(y) + σ2

dy2f(y),
corresponding to a Brownian motion with drift +µ and diﬀusion coeﬃcient σ. As is well
known (see, e.g., Karlin and Taylor 1981, Chapter 15), this process admits a unique station-
ary distribution on [0, ∞), which is exponential with rate µ/σ2.
# Shift back: Returning to Xτ = Yτ + log(ǫ), the limiting conditional distribution of Xτ
has density
fX(x) = µ

x ≥log(ǫ).
This is what we wanted to show. We note that the harmonic function above has exponential
rate 2µ/σ2, but the stationary density of the conditioned process has rate µ/σ2. This reﬂects
the diﬀerence between the reweighting function in the h-transform and the long-run behavior
of the resulting (drifted) process.
Proof of Theorem 5.
We study the asymptotic growth of the self-consistent threshold
ξτ := ε · E[Φτ | Φτ > ξτ],
