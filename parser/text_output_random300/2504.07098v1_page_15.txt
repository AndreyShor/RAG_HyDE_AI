FIG. 5: Zero modes on the interval 0 ≤x < ∞with S-shaped, symmetric or asymmetric Pöschl–Teller, or constant fields m(x) and v(x) as in
Fig. 4, but with w > ξ.
Here, the characteristic length w is, in principle, arbitrary but will be chosen, in practice, to match the characteristic length scale
of the spatial variations of m(x) and v(x). The modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation in Eq. (3) becomes
φ′′(y) + 1 −2y + 2wsv(y)
y(1 −y)
φ′(y) −
w2m(y)
y2(1 −y)2 φ(y) = 0,
(A3)
which presents two regular singular points at y = 0, 1. Assuming a wavefunction in the form
φ(y) = ywαL(1 −y)wαRF(y)
(A4)
with F(y) ̸= 0 at y = 0, 1, and expanding asymptotically at the singular points, we obtain the indicial equations for the exponents

For each set of exponents (αL, αR) = (α±
