Silicon vacancy in 4H-SiC gives rise to well-known PL lines, commonly referred to as V1 (h site) and V2 (k 
site) [50]. Moreover,  V1 has a high temperature companion labelled as V1’ [50], as shown in Figure 7.  This 
leads us to another noteworthy issue that adds to the complexity of defect engineering. The high-energy 
particle irradiation and ion implantation also introduce electrically active defects into SiC [15,43,44,64,65]. 
Among them is the silicon vacancy, which introduces two deep levels into the bandgap. Those levels are 
known as S1 and S2 and they have been assigned to different charge states of VSi at h and k site, (-3/=) 
and (=/0), respectively [15,44]. Bathen et al. [15] have presented a very rare if not unique study where 
optically and electrically active defects (i.e. silicon vacancies) are compared, offering valuable insight into 
their fundamental properties and potential for quantum technology applications [15]. In their study, they 
successfully correlated the optical V1/V1′ signals and the electrical S1/S2 signals.  
To summarize, once introduced in SiC, VSi has been comprehensively characterized using PL, EPR and 
OMDR [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,27,28,50,51,66]. Readers are strongly encouraged to explore the 
referenced papers for further insights. Ongoing research continues to focus on optimizing spatial 
precision, charge state control, and process efficiency to meet the growing demands of quantum 
applications. It is important to note that, for the sake of clarity, numerous other equally valuable studies 
have not been included in this summary.  
 
 3.2. Divacancies (Vₛᵢ-Vc) 
Together with negatively charged VSi, a neutral divacancy VSi-Vc is considered as a very promising 
candidate for quantum applications. A divacancy is formed when two neighboring silicon and carbon 
atoms are missing from the SiC lattice as shown in Figure 5.
