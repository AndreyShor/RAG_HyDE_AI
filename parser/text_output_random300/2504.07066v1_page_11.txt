2. Both µ(v)
c,2 and µ(v)
c,3 arise from the JT critical pair
and they should obey µ(v)
c,2 < 0.25 < µ(v)
c,3. Due to
C4, µ(v)
c,2(3) must represent a Kitaev transition or a
nodal transition, respectively.
Together with Eq. 23, we thus expect the system to un-
dergo the following VLT phase transitions as we increase
µ from −∞:
trivial
µ(v)
c,1
−→Kitaev
µ(v)
c,2
−→hybrid
µ(v)
c,3
−→nodal
µ(v)
c,4
−→trivial,
(24)
where “trivial”, “Kitaev”, “nodal” are short for trivial,
Kitaev, and nodal vortex phases, respectively. The “hy-
brid” vortex phase implies the coexistence of both Ki-
taev and nodal phases, which is protected by C4 symme-
try. Remarkably, Eq. 24 qualitatively reproduces with
the VLT phase diagram found in Ref. [28].
Numerically, we further evaluate the VLT phase dia-
gram of the tFeSC by simulating a ˆz-directional vortex
line on a 150 × 150 lattice in the x-y plane.
Periodic
boundary condition is imposed for ˆz, and the pairing po-
tential is ∆0 = 0.08. As shown in Fig. 4 (d), the energy
spectrum of the vortex is calculated as a function of µ at
kz = π, where we find four VLT transitions:
(µ(v)
c,1, µ(v)
c,2, µ(v)
c,3, µ(v)
c,4) = (−0.98, −0.17, 0.38, 1.25),
which quantitatively agree with µ(J)
c
for JT, up to O(∆0).
D.
Dirac octet
We move on to discuss the eight-band “Dirac octet”
model, which captures the low-energy topological physics
of a class of anti-perovskite compounds such as Sr3SnO
and Pb3SnO [42–46].
This family features two sets of
J = 3/2 bands, one from p orbitals and another from d
orbitals, that are inverted near the Fermi level. Each set
of J = 3/2 bands forms a four-fold degenerate quadratic
band touching at Γ, similar to the ones found in HgTe
and α-Sn [63]. Notably, while hope-doped Sr3SnO is re-
ported to be intrinsically superconducting [47], there are
no theoretical studies on either JT or VLT physics that
may emerge from its Dirac octet bands. We aim to fill
this theoretical gap in this part.
We now introduce the Dirac octet model,
hDO(k) = τzm(k) + τ0α(k) + τxh1(k),
(25)
where J = {Jx, Jy, Jz} are the spin-3/2 matrices and
˜J = { ˜Jx, ˜Jy, ˜Jz} are defined as ˜Ji ≡5

j̸=i JjJiJj −7

(i, j = x, y, z). In particular, m(k) = m0+ m1
2 (3−cos kx−
cos ky −cos kz) and α(k) = 2
3α0
P
i={x,y,z} coskiJi · ˜Ji.
The hybridization term between the J = 3/2 bands is
h1(k) = v1J · sin(k) + v2˜J · sin(k), where v1,2 control
the nature of the band inversion. As a cubic system, the
Dirac octet model respects many important symmetries,
including TRS Θ = −iτ0 ⊗γ2K, inversion P = τz, and
four-fold around ˆz rotation C4z = exp(−iπJz/2) ⊗τ0,
where γ matrices are defined following Eq. 15. The sys-
tem also features two inequivalent mirror symmetries
M100 = iτz ⊗γ1 and M110 = iτz ⊗(γ15 + γ25)/
√
2,
where M100 : (x, y, z) →(−x, y, z) and M110 : (x, y, z) →
(y, x, z).
As discussed in Ref. [46], the electronic topology of the
Dirac octet can be characterized by a 3D class-AII Z4 in-
dicator ω for inversion symmetry, as well as two indepen-
dent mirror Chern numbers of C100 and C110 defined for
M100 and M110. Please note that ω is fundamentally dis-
tinct from κ, the 2D class-DIII Z4 inversion indicator we
defined earlier for the Andreev bound states. Our choice
of parameter is (m0, m1, α0) = (−1, 2, −0.1, 0.12), which
ensures the p-d band inversion around Γ and a nontrivial
indicator ω = 2.
Meanwhile, both C100 and C110 are dictated by v1,2.
For example, we have (C100, C110) = (−2, 0) when v2 >
3v1. At the critical point with v2 = 3v1, the band gap
closes simultaneously at six different k-space locations
along the high-symmetry lines, as enforced by the cubic
symmetry. This multiple Dirac transition leaves ω invari-
ant but will lead to a net change of mirror Chern num-
bers by ±6. Specifically, we have (C100, C110) = (2, 2) for
v2 < 3v1, which exactly matches our ab-initio results for
Sr3SnO in Sec. V C. Therefore, we will use v2 = 2.7v1
throughout our later discussion.
A detailed study of
Dirac octet with v2 > 3v1 is provided in Appendix D.
We are now ready to update the Dirac octet to a BdG
form with s-wave spin-singlet superconductivity and ex-
plore its JT and VLT physics. Similar to the construction
in Sec. IV C, we consider a π-junction Hamiltonian with
300 unit cells along ˆx with a pairing amplitude ∆0 = 0.08.
For kz = 0, we plot the energy gap of the junction sys-
tem as a function of ky and µ, which offers a visualization
of the JT phase diagram. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), this
phase diagram harbors four on-TRIM JT transitions and
two pairs of off-TRIM JT transitions, dividing the phase
diagram into seven topologically distinct regions along µ.
Similar to the tFeSC system, the JT physics here can
be captured through the combination of the inversion
indicator κ ∈Z4 and the BdG mirror Chern number
CM ∈Z for Mx.
Again, CM is calculated with the
mirror-indexed Wilson loop technique for all negative-
energy states of the π-junction, where examples with
µ = 0.5, µ = 0, and µ = −0.5 are shown in Figs. 5 (b–d).
Numerically, we find that
(κ, CM) =
