a Neumann boundary condition such that f(1)(˜x = ˜xk) = uN,bc, we have ( ˜D(k) · fNcheb)(˜x =
˜xk) = uN,bc, where ˜D(k) is the k-th row of the matrix ˜D.
The boundary conditions we have implemented are: I) Dirichlet condition, with U(r =
0, t) = R(r = 0, t) = 0 and Γ(r = 0, t) = 1.
II) Neumann condition with the pressure
gradient vanishing at the outer boundary of the grid, ρ′(rmax, t) = 0, to approach the FLRW
background solution and help prevent reflections from density waves. Additionally, K′(r =
0, t) = 0 ensures the regularity of the evolution at the center. To implement these boundary
conditions at the points k = 0, Ncheb, we directly modify the values of the fields at the
boundary points. For the case (II) we simply do:
uk,new = uk +
1
˜Dk,k
(uN,bc −˜D(k) · fNcheb),
(4.11)
where uk,new represents the new value of the field at fNcheb(˜x = ˜xk) such that fulfills the
Neumann condition.
On the other hand, for initial data close to its critical threshold or for sharp profiles,
large gradients will develop during the numerical evolution, for which more refinement in
the specific domain where the gradients are developed would be convinient.
To manage
these cases, we have implemented a fixed mesh refinement procedure following [74]. This
procedure consists of using overlapping Chebyshev grids to increase the number of points
in regions where large gradients develop. For this purpose, we split the domain into several
grids that we denote with index l: ˜xk,l, ˜Dl, with N(l)
cheb points in each l grid. This requires
imposing boundary conditions across the domain to propagate the information during the
numerical evolution. To achieve this, in this work, we enforce continuity of the field values
and their derivatives: f(˜xN(l)cheb,l) = f(˜x0,l+1) and f(1)(˜xN(l)cheb,l) = f(1)(˜x0,l+1) across the
domains.

This worked well for our purposes.
Finally, the numerical accuracy of our simulation is
checked using the Hamiltonian constraint equation. Eq.(2.25).

Numerical results
In the following subsections, we show the numerical results of our study using the curvature
profiles ζ from Eq.(3.15). While we usually consider a perfect fluid with a constant equation
of state w in the analytical equations, our numerical study focuses on the case of a radiation-
dominated Universe with w = 1/3.

Time-evolution of the gravitational collapse
We study the dynamics of different hydrodynamic variables, in particular R, U, ρ, M, and
Γ, as well as the time evolution of the compaction function C, the compactness 2M/R, and
the expansion of the congruences Θ±. We consider three different scenarios: PBH formation
