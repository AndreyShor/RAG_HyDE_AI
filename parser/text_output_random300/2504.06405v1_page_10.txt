Mechanical characterization was conducted in a TA Instruments RSA-G2 dynamic mechanical 
analyzer (DMA) with 25 mm parallel steel plates. The sample was cut and mounted as a cuboid 
(2.5 mm thick) and compressed up to 0.1 N of force to achieve proper contact between the plates. 
Preliminary tests were performed to ensure the applied oscillatory strain and the corresponding 
stress remained in the linear viscoelastic region over the whole temperature range. The frequency 
sweep experiments were performed at the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz. The compression 
experiments were conducted at a constant rate of 0.01 mm/s.  
 
Dynamic rheological experiments were performed using a Discovery Hybrid Rheometer (DHR-
30), TA instruments. The mixture of TTT, EDT and supporting electrolyte in DMF were 
transferred through pipette to the rheometer. A parallel-plate fixture (25 mm) with a solvent trap 
was utilized for rheological investigations. The evolution of gel formation as a function of time 
was captured using small-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments at a strain amplitude of 1% and 
a frequency of 1 Hz. The gap size was set up to 0.5 mm. The experiments were performed at least 
three times and representative results were displayed.  
 
Lap shear tests were conducted on the material tester ZwickRoell zwickiLine Z0.5 (500 N loading 
cell) at 25 °C and 60 °C. The ITO-coated slides with thiol-ene adhesive, control and commercial 
adhesive samples (25 mm x 25 mm x 0.03mm) were prepared and loaded with the tension rate of 
10 mm/min. 
 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at 25 oC on a Gamry Reference 3000 potentiostat from 
Gamry Instruments. A platinum disc electrode, platinum wire and Ag/AgCl containing electrode 
were used as the working, counter and reference electrode, respectively. A typical cycle started 
from negative potential; the cycle continues by sweeping the potential between +1.2 V to -1.0 V 
with a scan rate of 0.2 V s-1.  
 
Vibration measurements were conducted at room temperature using a Polytec PSV 400 laser 
vibrometer. MATLAB R2022b was used to send a 10 V peak to peak (Vpp) sine-modulated 
gaussian pulse (2000 Hz) to a Tektronix AFG3022C function generator, which was subsequently 
amplified by a PiezoDrive PD200 amplifier at 20V/V. The amplified signal (200 Vpp) was then 
applied to the thiol-ene samples with copper tape electrodes. The PSV laser vibormeter records the 
velocity of the resulting vibration at a sampling frequency of 51.2k Hz, with the result being 
averaged for 5000 times.   
 
Electric field- induced thiol-ene linear polymerization 
In a typical experiment, ZnO (210 mg, 2.58 mmol) was dispersed in 1.5 mL DMF by ultrasound 
for 20 seconds and allowed to rest for 30 mins. Two thiol-ene monomers, tri(ethylene glycol) 
divinyl ether (3 mmol,  606 mg, 0.612 mL) and 2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)diethanethiol (3 mmol, 546 
mg, 0.489 mL ) and Et4NBF4 (0.15 mmol, 32.5 mg) were added to the reaction mixture and took 
2 ml mixed solution into a cuboid polypropylene vial. Finally, the plastic vial was typically 
attached to the power sources (AC or DC power) with two wired Pt electrodes inside. The applied 
voltages were typically operated at 500 Hz, 8 Vrms for generating alternating electric field unless 
otherwise noted. Aliquots were collected at intervals and analyzed using 1H-NMR for calculating 
the conversion.
