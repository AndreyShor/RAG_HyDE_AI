Table 2: Summary of the performance of current models across various physical property
prediction benchmarks. The first four columns cover both low- and high-frequency vibrational
properties from the MDR phonon benchmark [27, 18]; the highest phonon frequency 𝜔max,
the vibrational entropy 𝑆, free energy 𝐹, and heat capacity 𝑐V. The last two columns cover
mechanical properties, and were obtained using MatCalc and the associated benchmark dataset
of elastic constants [25]. A full overview of all computational details is given in Appendix G.
Table 2 presents the performance of a variety of models across these properties, and it allows
us to make two major observations.
First, orb-v3-conservative-inf-omat achieves the
highest accuracy for almost all of the metrics in the table, while being faster than any of the
best-performing models currently available in literature. This is a clear demonstration that
architectural constraints can be relaxed in the interest of performance, provided that there is
a sufficient amount of high quality QM data available to train on. At present, this condition
is evidently satisfied by the OMat24 dataset, which contains ∼55 million AIMD-sampled
structures. The second observation is that even a non-conservative model with a sparse graph
featurization such as orb-v3-direct-20-omat is comparable in accuracy to the current state
of the art in literature. This is remarkable, considering that it is about 30 times faster than
SevenNet, the current best performing model in literature (see Figure 2 for speed benchmarks).
Equigrad - Learned Rotational Invariance
To incentivize learned invariance during training, we introduce equigrad, a simple, differentiable
metric which quantifies the degree of rotational invariance and which can be used as a
regularization method during training. Conceptually, we compute a gradient of the predicted
energy 𝐸with respect to an identity rotation matrix 𝑹that is inserted into the computational
graph at the input. An elegant way to achieve this is by first expressing an identity rotation 𝑹as
the matrix exponential of a skew-symmetric null matrix, and then computing the gradient of 𝐸
with respect to that null matrix:
𝑹= 𝑒𝑮−𝑮𝑇

where 𝒓are atomic positions and 𝒉is the cell matrix.
Invariant models have by definition Δrot = 0 because the predicted energy does not depend on
the global orientation of the input coordinates and cell vectors. For non-invariant models trained
with data augmentation, ||Δrot|| is naturally small but nonzero, and quantifies the hypothetical
change in energy if a rotation were to be applied at the input.
For conservative models, evaluation of Equation 1 is essentially trivial since computing the
interatomic forces and virial stress already require a backward pass through the network. As
