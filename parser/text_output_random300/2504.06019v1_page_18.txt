Note that k2 ≡k2
x + k2
y, and, a first order Taylor expansion is used to express
q′
s ≈α¯qsb′. In this formulation, we have replaced ˆb with ˆm to implement the upper
moist pseudoadiabatic boundary conditions. The second boundary condition in
equation (43) is equivalent to q = qs. We solve the eigenvalue problem numerically
using the Dedalus framework (Burns et al. 2020). The eigenvalue problem given by
equations (36) - (43) is for a smooth approximation of the Heaviside function, which
allows H to be Taylor-expanded (about ¯q−¯qs). We approximate H(x) = 1
2(1+erf(kx))
with k = 103 so that, dH(x) =
k
√πe−(kx)2. Including this dH term is essential for
accurately predicting the onset of convection for non-linear simulations which use a
smooth approximation of the Heaviside function.
The first step in the solving the EVP is to calculate the numerical basic state
solution (for smooth H). The numerical basic state solution is obtained by using
Dedalus to solve the non-linear boundary value problem (given by equations (28) -
(31)), with the analytical solution as an initial guess (to speed up convergence).
To compute the critical Rayleigh number (Rac), we first calculate the basic
state for smooth H (numerically) for a given Rayleigh number (Ra). The numerical
basic state solution is obtained by using Dedalus to solve the non-linear boundary
value problem (given by equations (28) - (31)), with the analytical solution as an
initial guess (to speed up convergence). We then solve the eigenvalue problem for
a range of wavenumbers, k =
q
k2x + k2y, and determine kmax which maximises the
growth rate (ℑ(σ)). We adjust Ra iteratively, and repeat the above method, until the
absolute value of the maximum growth rate is less than a tolerance, which we take to
be 10−8. The pair (Ra, kmax) which satisfies these conditions determines the critical
Rayleigh number, Rac, and the critical wavenumber, kc.
