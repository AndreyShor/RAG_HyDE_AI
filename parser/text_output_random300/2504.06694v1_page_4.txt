2. Two Frobenius algebra structures
In this section, we will ﬁnd two Frobenius algebra structures (namely, CY Frobenius algebra and LG
Frobenius algebra) on the primitive middle-dimensional cohomology Hm−1
pr
(X). This will be done by
transport of structures through the following isomorphisms of graded vector spaces

The CY Frobenius algebra structure exists on the cohomology of the space PV(X) of polyvector ﬁelds
for any compact Calabi–Yau manifold X by the work of Barannikov–Kontsevich in [2], which we brieﬂy
recall in Subsection 2.1. Then, in Subsection 2.2, we will construct the LG Frobenius algebra structure
on Hm−1
pr
(X); this is based on the Batyrev–Cox theorem, which says that Hm−1
pr
(X) is isomorphic to a
certain subring A(f) of the Jacobian ring R(f) = S/J(f) where J(f) is the Jacobian ideal of f.
2.1. CY Frobenius algebra. Let X be a compact Calabi–Yau manifold of dimension n. We ﬁx a choice
of a nowhere-vanishing holomorphic n-form ΩX on X. Let TX (respectively, T∗
X) be the holomorphic
tangent (respectively, cotangent) bundle on X. We write Ωk
X := ∧kT∗
X.
Let PVi,j(X) := A0,j(X, ∧iTX) denote the space of smooth (0, j)-forms valued in ∧iTX. Consider the
isomorphism A0,j(X, ∧iTX) ∼= A0,j(X, Ωn−i
X ) given by contracting with ΩX, which we denote by ⊢ΩX.
This induces an isomorphism
cΩX :

i,j=0
A0,j(X, ∧iTX)

M
i,j=0
A0,j(X, Ωn−i
X )
and hence an isomorphism Hj(X, ∧iTX) ∼= Hn−i,j(X) for each 0 ≤i, j ≤n after taking ∂-cohomology.
Moreover, by the Hodge decomposition Hk(X) ∼=
L
p+q=k Hp,q(X) and by the degeneration of the
Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence, this induces an isomorphism Hk(X) ∼=
L
j−i=k−n Hj(X, ∧iTX)
for each 0 ≤k ≤n.
Note that the space Ln
i,j=0 PVi,j(X) has a product structure coming from the product of holomorphic
polyvector ﬁelds valued in anti-holomorphic diﬀerential forms:
∧: A0,j(X, ∧iTX) × A0,l(X, ∧kTX) →A0,j+l(X, ∧i+kTX).
Now let us construct a Frobenius algebra that will correspond to Hn(X). Let us set
PVr(X) :=
M
r=j−i
PVi,j(X).
Then in the case of r = 0, the contraction map cΩX restricts to an isomorphism
cΩX :
n
M
j=0
A0,j(X, ∧jTX)
∼
=
−→
n
M
j=0
A0,j(X, Ωn−j

)
and induces an isomorphism H0(PV(X)) := Ln
j=0 Hj,j(PV(X))
∼
=
−→Hn(X) where Hj,j(PV(X)) :=
Hj(X, ∧jTX). Under this isomorphism Hj,j(PV(X)) corresponds to Hn−j,j(X). Also, it has a trace
map TrCY : PV(X) →C given by
TrCY(ω) =
Z
X
(ω ⊢ΩX) ∧ΩX.
(2.1)
Clearly, the trace map vanishes unless ω ∈PVn,n(X) and in fact it induces an isomorphism Hn,n(PV(X)) ∼=
C. Using TrCY, we deﬁne a symmetric bilinear pairing ⟨−, −⟩CY on H0(PV(X)) by
⟨ω, η⟩CY := TrCY(w ∧η) =
Z
X
((ω ∧η) ⊢ΩX) ∧ΩX,
(2.2)
for ω, η ∈PV(X). This yields a Frobenius algebra (Ln
i,j=0 Hj(X, ∧iTX), ∧, ⟨−, −⟩CY).
By construction, the product map of the form
∧: A0,i(X, ∧iTX) × A0,j(X, ∧jTX) →A0,i+j(X, ∧i+jTX)
