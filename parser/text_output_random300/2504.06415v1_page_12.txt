with z > 0.5 and G < 20.5 after cross-matching the
SDSS DR16Q catalog with GAIA DR3 data within 3′′,
proper motion classification, PCA analysis and litera-
ture search.
Here, we further correct the number of
quasar pairs in our final double quasar sample with
z > 0.5 and G < 20.5 using the completeness correction
mentioned in Section 2.4 and perform several analyses
based on this final double quasar sample as follows.
To match with previous studies (e.g., Shen et al.
2023a), we define the pair fraction as the ratio of the
number of pairs to the total number of parent quasars
with matched flux limit and redshift range. Because the
pair fraction of luminous quasars is ≪1%, we neglect
the small contribution of companion quasars in the par-
ent quasar count.
3.1. Double Quasar Fraction
We first calculate the completeness-corrected dou-
ble quasar fraction. The completeness-corrected double
quasar fraction is defined as the ratio of the number of
quasar pairs in each separation bin to the total number
of quasars in the parent sample, where each observed
quasar pair is weighted by 1/fcomp according to its Gpri,
∆G, and ∆θ. The correction is significant primarily in
the subarcsecond regime (Shen et al. 2023a). Here, we
define the parent quasar sample as all matched SDSS
DR16Q quasars in Gaia with z > 0.5 and G < 20.5
(302,940 quasars), the same magnitude and redshift cuts
as our final pair sample. Double quasars with separa-
tions of 0 −3′′ is negligible compared to the matched
SDSS DR16Q quasar population (10−3 ∼10−4 calcu-
lated in the following paragraphs), so we do not add the
potential quasar-like companions to the parent sample.
Moreover, the parent sample only serves as the denomi-
nator in the pair fraction calculation and does not affect
the relative fraction and overall evolution trend in dif-
ferent separation bins.
Only two pairs in our double quasar sample slightly
exceed the 3D grid of Gpri,
∆G,
and ∆θ
used
to calculate 1/fcomp, as their companions are too
dim and their magnitude differences slightly exceed
3.
J083056.16+062412.8
has
a
companion
with
Gpri = 17.48, ∆G = 3.01, and ∆θ = 1.′′33, while
J113625.42+100523.2 has a companion with Gpri =
17.30, ∆G = 3.16, and ∆θ = 2.′′90.
These excesses
are not significant, and their separations are beyond the
subarcsecond regime; thus, we use the 1/fcomp in bins
of 2.5 < ∆G < 3.0 as a reasonable estimate for these
two pairs.
We further estimate the uncertainties of the corrected
pair statistics using bootstrap resampling of the pairs,
which align well with Poisson uncertainties estimated
from the raw pair counts in each separation bin. The
corrected pair statistics is reported in Table 3, and Fig-
ure 8 displays the completeness-corrected double quasar
fraction as a function of angular separation in differ-
ent redshift ranges. We adopt bootstrap errors in this
analysis as they better reflect the sample characteris-
tics, while Poisson errors for each separation bin are
also provided in Table 3.
The cumulative pair frac-
tion within 0.′′3 −3.′′1 is 5.7+0.3
−0.3 × 10−4 among z > 0.5
quasars.
We further divide these quasar pairs to two
groups at z = 1.5, which is close to the median redshift
of the pair sample (⟨z⟩= 1.7). The low-redshift group
(⟨z⟩= 1.0) includes 54 quasar pairs with a cumulative
pair fraction of 4.9+0.2
−0.2 × 10−4, while the high-redshift
group (⟨z⟩= 2.0) has 82 quasar pairs with a cumula-
tive pair fraction of 6.2+0.5
−0.5 ×10−4. The cumulative pair
fraction for the higher-redshift group is only marginally
larger that that for the lower-redshift group, with a dif-
ference of 0.10+0.03
−0.03 dex. Furthermore, Figure 8 shows
that the double quasar fractions are consistent in most
separation bins for different redshift ranges, overlapping
within 1σ. The only difference occurs at ∆θ = 0.′′3−0.′′5
due to no double quasar detection for the low-redshift
group.
In Figure 8, the completeness-corrected double quasar
fraction increases toward smaller separations, consistent
with previous results using Gaia EDR3 for z > 1.5
and G < 20.25 quasars (Shen et al. 2023a). We note
that the actual fractions at separation larger than 1.′′5
should be even lower due to uncorrected stellar contam-
ination as discussed in Section 2.3. And if we assume
a stellar contamination rate of 56% for the corrected
number of quasar pairs at z > 1.5, G < 20.5, and
PAIR SEP ≥1.′′5 as estimated in Section 2.3, the cumu-
lative double quasar fractions may decrease by ∼30%,
though the overall increasing trend toward smaller sep-
arations remains unchanged. The steepening of the pair
fraction at small separations suggests an increase in
small-scale quasar clustering on physical scales of ≲30
kpc compared with the power-law extrapolation of the
large-scale clustering (e.g., Shen et al. 2023a).
3.2. Comparison with Previous Work
Due to the larger redshift coverage from z ∼0.5 to
z ∼4.5, we also investigate the redshift evolution of the
dual quasar fraction to compare with other observations
and simulations. The definition of the dual quasar frac-
tion as a function of redshift is similar to the double
quasar fraction as a function of separation, but evalu-
ated for physically-associated quasar pairs (as defined in
Section 1) in different redshift bins for all pairs at < 3′′
separations.
