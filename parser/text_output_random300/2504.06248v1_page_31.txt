2. incoming edges from the vertices outside {a, b, c, d} in the graph, i.e.,
Wak = Wbk = Wck = Wdk,
∀k ∈{1, ..., N} \ {a, b, c, d} ;
(S77)
3. natural frequencies, i.e.,
ωa = ωb = ωc = ωd ;
(S78)
Proof. When the phase lags are zero, A = 1
2(σW + i diag(ω)). In this case, the first two conditions of Thm. S12,
which only involve non-diagonal terms of A, coincide with the first two conditions stated in the corollary. Using the
explicit form of the third condition in Thm. S12, that is,
ωa −σWkaa sin αkaa = ωb −σWkbb sin αkbb = ωc −σWkcc sin αkcc = ωd −σWkdd sin αkdd ,
where kj takes any value within {a, b, c, d} \ {j} for j ∈{a, b, c, d}, the sine terms vanish due to the zero phase lags.
This directly yields ωa = ωb = ωc = ωd, as stated in the third condition of the corollary.

Corollary S21. Let SN denote an undirected binary star graph with N vertices. Then, S5 is the smallest such graph
for which a cross-ratio is a constant of motion in the Kuramoto model (1) with zero phase lags.
Proof. The cross-ratio involves 4 vertices and the stars S1 (trivial graph), S2 (path), or S3 (path) are readily excluded.
For N = 4, denote the core by a and the periphery by {b, c, d} without loss of generality. The core is connected to
all vertices in the periphery, so in particular, Wab = 1. However, Wcb = 0 ̸= Wab and thus the first condition in
Corollary S19 is not satisfied.
For N = 5, let the core be labeled e and the periphery {a, b, c, d}. The first condition is readily satisfied since there
is no edge between the peripheral vertices in Corollary S19. The second condition in Corollary S19 is also satisfied
since Wae = Wbe = Wce = Wde = 1. Setting the natural frequencies of the vertices a, b, c, d to be identical, the
Kuramoto model on the star S5 admits the cross-ratio cabcd as a constant of motion by Corollary S19.
Remark S22. In the directed case, the smallest star that admits a conserved cross-ratio is composed of 4 vertices, as
shown in Fig. S3.

LIE SYMMETRIES AND THE GENERATION OF NEW CONSTANTS OF MOTION
The concept of symmetry for differential equations has a long story that has flourished from the work of Sophus
Lie to the work of Emmy Noether. Below, we only present very briefly the theory for ordinary differential equations
in order to present the symmetry criterion under Koopman’s perspective and dive quickly into its application to the
Kuramoto model. For more details, the reader is invited to visit Refs. [60, 72, 84–89] and in particular, the great
book of Peter Olver [60] that includes pertinent historical remarks, reproducible examples, and crucial theorems for
general differential equations. The theorem of interest for us is based on the concept of prolongation of a vector field
and gives us the necessary and sufficient conditions to have a symmetry group. Without giving the details, it is stated
as follows.
Theorem S23 (Theorem 2.71 [60]). Let ∆(x, u(n)) = 0 be a nondegenerate system of ℓdifferential equations. A
connected local group of transformations G acting on an open subset M ⊂X × U is a symmetry group of the system
if and only if
pr(n) v[∆ν(x, u(n))] = 0 ,
ν ∈{1, ..., ℓ} ,
whenever
∆(x, u(n)) = 0 ,
(S79)
for every infinitesimal generator v of G.
Remark S24. The function ∆from the n-jet space X × U (n) to Rℓis considered to be smooth in its arguments [60,
p.96]. Moreover, it is also assumed that the infinitesimal generator v and its prolongations act on the space of smooth
functions, a fact that we will use later. Finally, we refer to p.20-22 of Ref. [60] for the definition of a connected local
group of transformations.
In the next subsection, we use this general result for first-order ordinary differential equations and show that the
infinitesimal criterion (S79) is elegantly written in terms of the Koopman generator.
