As expected, the one-dimensional M = 1 irreducible representation is the most common building
block of the representation at small Ω2N. At any nonzero Ω2N the full representation is not
entirely trivial, due to the Boltzmann population of nontrivial representations.
To characterise the spread of representations about the trivial representation more precisely,
we can look at the mean and variance of the Casimir (6). The variance of the nM is given by
σ2
nM = ∂2 log eZ
∂α2
M
= ⟨nM⟩.
(28)
Here we used the grand canonical partition function (21). The mean and variance of the Casimir
are both given in terms of n2, to leading nontrivial order, as the one-dimensional representation
doesn’t contribute to the Casimir and higher representations are suppressed. That is
⟨1
N Tr C2⟩≈

In particular, ⟨1

As Ω2N is increased, at fixed N, the width of the distribution decreases relative to its average.
This predicts that the distribution of Casimirs will increasingly detach from the origin, as the
average grows proportionally to Ω2N while the width grows more slowly.
We have verified the grand canonical predictions in Fig. 4, which shows a numerical com-
putation of the entire probability distribution P( 1
N Tr C2). The numerics have been done using

Figure 4: Probability distribution of the Casimir for small values of Ω2N, calculated with
N = 20. Each point gives the probability of the Casimir, not the probability density. Solid lines
are obtained from the full partition function, while the translucent lines are obtained using the
small deformation approximation (19). The two sets of curves are almost indistinguishable.
