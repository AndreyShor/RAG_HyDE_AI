We take Pr = Sm = 1, ˆγ = 0.25, ˆα = 6.0 and ˆτ = 0.05 (corresponding to a
condensational timescale of τ ∼1s). We vary the parameters ˆr, ˆbsurf and Ra. Note
that ˆr = 1 × 10−5 for a typical atmospheric cooling rate of 2Kday−1, and ˆbsurf = 0.05
for a surface temperature increase of 5K. For molecular values of κ and ν, Ra ∼1023.
The

and
buoyancy
scales
used
in
this
non-
dimensionalisation do not reflect changes in stability caused by changes in the
temperature profile via changes in surface temperature, surface moisture, or ulti-
mately, radiative cooling. Therefore Ra in this non-dimensionalisation is only sensitive
to changes in κ or ν. However, the dry adiabatic buoyancy non-dimensionalisation sim-
plifies the form of the equations, and allows easy implementation of the climate change
scenario, and we therefore employ the dry adiabatic buoyancy non-dimensionalisation
in the rest of the analysis in this paper noting that we drop the hats on the parameters
for the rest of the analysis.

Integral Constraints: Energy and Moisture Budgets
By integrating the moisture and buoyancy equations over the atmospheric column,
we can obtain integral constraints on the model. This approach is well understood
in climate science and is one basis for analysing future rainfal patterns (Held and
Soden 2006; Byrne and O’Gorman 2015). We consider these constraints for equilib-
rium, in which ∂/∂t = 0. Using equation (11), we can write the water budget (column
integrated moisture equation) as,
Z 1

where z is the height, we have defined the precipitation term (P) to be the column
integral of the moisture sink associated with condensation, with condensation defined
as,

Similarly, the energy budget (column integrated buoyancy equation) can be written
as,
