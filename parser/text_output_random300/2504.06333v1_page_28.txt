In addition to the line operators in (6.20), the additional couplings give rise to
new topological operators in the bulk, given by
˜X[∂δ1 = y,δ1] = exp(i∫δ1
˜b1 + ib0(y)),
V [γ1 = ∂Σ2,Σ2] = exp(i∫Σ2 c2 + i∮γ1 ˜a1).

We observe that the SymTFT is engineered in a way, there are no free topological
point operators in the bulk. We now turn to a discussion of various boundary
conditions (summarized in Table (2)) of this SymTFT.
• We realize Z2t ×Z2e symmetry by imposing the Dirichlet boundary condition
on a1, ˜a1,c2 and Neumann boundary condition on b1,˜b1,b0.
Under these
conditions, the line operator ˜X[∂δ1 = y,δ1] remains parallel to the symmetry
boundary and generates the trivially acting Z2t symmetry. Since they end
on topological point operators, they do not link with any other operators.
In contrast, the X[γ′
1] line operators generate eﬀective Z2e symmetry.
• We take Dirichlet b.c. for b1,˜b1,c2 and Neumann b.c for a1, ˜a1,b0, this cor-
responds to gauging Z2t × Z2e. This gauging results in free topological point
operators on the symmetry boundary, leading to a decomposing theory. The
surface operator V [γ1 = ∂Σ2,Σ2] terminates on line operators, which remain
topological on the symmetry boundary. These line operators act as domain
walls, separating distinct universes.
As a special case, one may instead gauge a subgroup of Z2t×Z2e. Gauging the
trivially acting subgroup still leads to decomposition. In contrast, gauging
the eﬀective Z2e does not result in a decomposing theory.
• Finally, we can undo the decomposition by gauging the 1-form symmetry.
In order to that we need to impose Dirichlet boundary condition on b1,˜b1,b0
and Neumann on a1, ˜a1,c2. The surface operator V [γ1 = ∂Σ2,Σ2] will now
generate a (−1)-form symmetry.
