with 𝑁𝑆𝑛𝑂 and 𝑁𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒 being the atomic number densities of Sn2+ in the oxide and Sn0 in the metal, respectively. 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒 
and 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑂 are known or calculated values of the effective attenuation length (EAL) in the oxide and in the metal. They 
are functions of the kinetic energy 𝐸𝑘= ℎ𝜈−𝐸𝑏−𝜙, for which ℎ𝜈 is the X-ray energy (here Al Kα with 1486.6 eV), 𝐸𝑏 
is the binding energy, and 𝜙 is the work function of the spectrometer. It is widely recognized that the EAL is more 
accurate than the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) for quantitative XPS depth profiling, as it takes into account the 
influence of elastic scattering.[28][29] Therefore, in the following, only 𝐿 is used instead of 𝜆. Additional discussion and 
information on the calculation of both 𝐿 and 𝜆  is given in the SI. In principle, eq. 1 should give the same result for 
every peak and emission angle. Different intensity ratios are therefore expected, because different peaks correspond 
to different values of 𝐸𝑘. 
In an earlier publication, we advanced this widely used single-energy model for the application to multiple emission 
peaks in a fixed-angle spectrum (each consisting of one metallic and one oxide component peak) to obtain a gradual 
concentration profile at the oxide-metal interface, as described by an error function 𝐶𝑆𝑛2+(𝑧) = 0.5 ∙erfc(𝑘∙
(𝑧−𝑑)) ∙100%, for which 𝑘 is the sharpness of the interface:[20]

In this equation, 𝐿𝑎𝑣 is the average of 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒 and 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑂. However, this averaging can be subject to error if 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒 and 
𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑂 differ sufficiently from each other. We have therefore revised the equation[20] to include distinct values for the 
metal and the oxide. The resulting model has three independent variables 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑂, 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒, and 𝜃 as well as two fitting 
parameters 𝑘 and 𝑑 (additional information on the derivation is given in the SI):

This equation reduces to eq. 1 in the limit 𝑘→∞, i.e. a step function profile at the interface. Both eq. 2 and 3 can 
either be applied to a single spectrum at constant 𝜃 or to an ARXPS data set for which 𝜃 is treated as an independent 
variable. Here, we utilize both variants at once, thus mapping the entire energy-angle landscape. Peak fitting models 
were developed for all emission peaks and applied to spectra measured at emission angles of 𝜃=
75°, 60°, 45°, 30°, 15°, 0°. Figure 3 shows most of these peak fittings at three exemplary angles (some peaks and some 
angles have been omitted for better readability). A more detailed discussion on the development of these peak models 
as well as binding energy values, line shapes, and backgrounds can be found in the SI. The peak fittings yield the 
𝐼𝑆𝑛2+/𝐼𝑆𝑛0 intensity ratios for every emission peak of Sn. Te shows no sign of oxidation.
