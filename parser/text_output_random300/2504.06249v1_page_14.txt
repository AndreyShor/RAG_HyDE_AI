ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION PLOTS OF FORMATION ENERGIES PER ATOM
(a) Classifier-based guidance at T = 200
(b) Classifier-free guidance at T = 200
(c) Classifier-based guidance at T = 500
(d) Classifier-free guidance at T = 500
Figure B.1: Distribution of formation energies per atom (eV/atom) for structures conditionally generated at
T âˆˆ{200, 500} using (a) classifier-based guidance and (b) classifier-free guidance. All generated structures
are relaxed using the Orb-v2 interatomic potential. The ground truth distribution corresponds to the
formation energies of the original test set structures, with all energies predicted using Orb-v2.
