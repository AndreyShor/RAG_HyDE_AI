Figure 3: Overview of the workflow for calculating an imaging-derived health disparities index (iHDI). SDOH: 
social determinants of health. 
 
Four forms of measures from the HD*Calc framework can serve as iHDIs to measure differences 
between groups: (a) absolute difference as measured by between-group variance44 (BGV), (b) 
relative difference  as measured by index of disparity45 (IDisp), (c) Theil index46 (T), and (d) mean 
log deviation47 (MLD). These are applicable to imaging-derived health rates due to the unordered 
nature of the SDOH-related phenotype data that are aggregated. Note that there are other measures 
available in HD*Calc, but they depend upon ordered data, which is outside of the scope of SDOH-
related phenotype data from medical images. Below, we describe the indices and refer the reader 
to the specific equations and interpretations provided at the HD*Calc Help System website.48
