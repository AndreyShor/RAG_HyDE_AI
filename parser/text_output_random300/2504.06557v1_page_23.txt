economy has unidirectional edges; wealth stagnates in the early stages of the step, but 
as the steps progress, wealth propagates simultaneously. 
 
Discussion 
The calculation results of the network model corresponding to the four 
economic modes reveal that, first, inequality is suppressed in the following order: (d) 
concession economy, (c) gift economy, (b) power economy , and (a) market economy; 
second, enclosure in (a) market economy is the main cause of inequality, while 
redistribution in (b) power economy contributes to mitigating enclosure; third, (c) gift 
and (d) concession economies bring about healthy and equal societies; and fourth, the 
original question of whether (d) concession economy can be established even without 
the guarantee of exchange or reciprocity can be resolved. This is the first time, from the 
perspective of a mathematical network model, that the recovery of reciprocity in a 
higher dimension by Karatani, the baseline communism of Graeber, and the We-turn of 
Deguchi are economically possible. 
 The small values of the centrality deviation and Gini coefficient in the (c) 
gift and (d) concession economies indicate that the community is equal or hollow (i.e., 
there is no specific authority). Furthermore, it was found that in a community, 
maintaining large clusters is not necessarily better, such as in (a) market and (b) power 
economies. However, the continued dynamic formation of moderate clusters leads to a 
healthier and more equal economy, such as in (c) gift and (d) concession economies. 
 The (d) concession economy is preferable to (c) gift economy in that it is 
free from the constraints of obligation to return; conversely, the key is how to continue
