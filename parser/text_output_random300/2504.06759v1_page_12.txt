SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 1: REAL AND RECIPROCAL LATTICE GEOMETRY
Rhombohedral graphite has a unit cell with primitive lattice vectors a1 = a(−1/2,
√
3/2, 0),
a2 = a(1/2,
√
3/2, 0), and a3 = (0, a/
√
3, c). The in-plane lattice parameter a = 2.46 ˚A and the
interlayer spacing c = 3.35 ˚A1. Because of broken out-of-plane periodicity for all junctions except
AB|CA, the relevant Brillouin zone is that of two-dimensional graphene.

Real and reciprocal lattice geometry. a. In-plane real space structure of
a graphene monolayer. Filled (empty) circles indicate the positions of atoms belonging to sublattice A
(B). b. The hexagonal first Brillouin zone of graphene. Equivalent corners are denoted with like colours.
c. A trilayer section of rhombohedral stacked graphite. d. Side view of the trilayer section. Hopping
processes included in the Hamiltonian used in the minimal model are denoted by γ0 and γ1.
