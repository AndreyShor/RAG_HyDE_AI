 The purpose is not to examine the properties of random graphs for a given 
probability or to fit them to measured data but to examine the generation process and 
properties of the four economic modes. Therefore, we use the simplest random graph 
model without pre-assigned probabilities or properties. This model is known as the 
button and thread model and was presented by theoretical biologist Kauffman as an 
example of self-organization [27]. When the ratio of the number of threads to the 
number of buttons exceeds 0.5, large clusters suddenly appear, and a phase transition 
occurs. This is useful in observing the emergence of the four economic modes. 
 Therefore, in this study, we simulate four economic modes using a simple 
random graph model by randomly generating edges while changing the list of nodes 
and the direction of edges. The node list represents the enclosure of (iii) market 
economy and the equality of (i) gift and (iv) concession economies, whereas the edge 
direction represents the exchange in (iii) market economy, the obligation to return in (i) 
a gift economy, and the de-obligation to return in (iv) concession economy. The 
redistribution of (ii) the power economy is a mitigation of enclosure; that is, it is 
positioned as an intermediate between (iii) the market economy and (i) the gift economy. 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: in the Methods section, we present 
the calculation methods for the network models corresponding to the four economic 
modes. In the Results section, we present the calculation results of representative 
properties such as the clustering coefficient, graph density, reciprocity, assortativity, 
and centrality, including the Gini coefficient, representing the degree of inequality. In 
the Discussion section, we review the properties of the four economic modes and 
discuss the challenges and future developments (iv) concession economy.
