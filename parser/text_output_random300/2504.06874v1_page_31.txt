Fig. S12. Examination of the extracted optical contrast between two polar 
stackings of device 1 by selecting different areas. a&b, Optical contrast between two 
polar stackings extracted along the same scanning rows (a) and different scanning rows 
(b) for the first cycle gate-dependent SNOM measurement. c&d, Optical contrast 
between two polar stackings extracted along the same scanning rows (a) and different 
scanning rows (b) for the second cycle gate-dependent SNOM measurement. In (a) to 
(d), the extracted optical contrast from Vg = 0 V to positive maximum Vg are denoted 
by red dots, those measured from positive maximum Vg to negative maximum Vg are 
denoted by the blues dots, and those measured from negative maximum Vg back to Vg 
= 0 V are denoted by green dots. When comparing (a) with (b) and (c) with (d), we can 
observe that despite the selected areas are different, the trend of the extracted optical 
contrast upon varying Vg is the same. The results shown in Fig. S8 are also consistent 
with those shown in Fig. 2i of the main text. Insets: The white boxes label the sample 
areas of the two nearby regions in the main text. The scale bars are all 1 µm. Insets in 
(a) to (d): the white boxes label the sample areas of the two nearby regions from which 
we extract the average optical near-field response and obtain the optical contrast. The 
scale bars in all the insets are 1 µm.
