that a total of three centrifuge steps were per-formed. Finally, the washed nanoparticles were dried 
at vacuum oven under 60 Â°C overnight.  
 
Electric field- induced thiol-ene reaction using thiol-ZnO nanopaticles 
 
To further explore the surface chemistry, the dried thiol-ZnO from the previous experiments was 
dispersed in 1.5 mL DMF by ultrasound for 20 seconds and allowed to rest for 30 mins. 
Tri(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether (3 mmol,  606 mg, 0.612 mL) and Et4NBF4 (0.15 mmol, 32.5 
mg) were added to the reaction mixture and took 2 mL mixed solution into a cuboid polypropylene 
vial. The plastic vial was connected to an AC power source with two wired Pt electrodes inside, 
operating at 500 Hz and 16 Vrms for 3 hours. Control experiments with the same formulation but 
without applying an AC voltage were conducted to examine the effect of the electric field on the 
polymerization process. Aliquots were collected and analyzed using 1H-NMR for calculating the 
conversion. 
 
Evaluation of E-thiol-ene radical generation 
In a typical experiment, ZnO (210 mg, 2.58mmol) was dispersed in 1.5 mL DMF by ultrasound 
for 20 seconds and allowed to rest for 30 mins. TEGDE (3 mmol, 606 mg, 0.612 mL), EDT (3 
mmol, 546 mg, 0.489 mL), MEHQ (0.15 to 0.60 mmol) and Et4NBF4 (0.15 mmol, 32.5 mg) were 
added to the reaction mixture and underwent three cycles of freeze-pump-thaw treatment to 
eliminate dissolved oxygen. Finally, the plastic vial with 2 ml mixed solution was directly attached 
to the power sources (AC, 4 Vrms, 500 Hz) with two wired Pt electrodes. Aliquots were collected 
and analyzed using 1H-NMR for calculating the conversion.  
 
Evaluation of E-thiol-ene linear polymerization in glove-box 
In a glove-box equipped with an AC power supply, ZnO (210 mg, 2.58 mmol) was weighed and 
mixed with 1.5 mL DMF in a sealed tube. The resulting ZnO dispersion was then transferred 
outside and dispersed by ultrasound (sealed tube with Ar) for 20 seconds and allowed to rest for 
30 mins in the glove-box. Subsequently, TEGDE (3 mmol, 606 mg, 0.612 mL), EDT (3 mmol, 
546 mg, 0.489 mL) and Et4NBF4 (0.15 mmol, 32.5 mg) were added to the reaction mixture and 
transferred outside the glove-box under Ar protection for three cycles of freeze-pump-thaw 
treatment to eliminate dissolved oxygen. Finally, the degassed reaction mixture was transferred 
back to glove-box and 2 ml mixed solution was dispensed into a plastic vial with two wired Pt 
electrodes inside. Finally, the plastic vial was then directly attached to the AC power sources. The 
applied voltages were operated at 500 Hz, 8 Vrms for generating alternating electric field at 1-, 5-, 
15- and 30-min. Aliquots were collected at intervals and analyzed using 1H-NMR for calculating 
the conversion.  
 
Quantitative Evaluation of EDT adsorption on ZnO nanoparticle surface 
In a typical experiment, ZnO (210 mg, 2.58 mmol) and Et4NBF4 (0.15 mmol, 32.5 mg) were 
dispersed in 1.5 mL DMF by ultrasound for 20 seconds and allowed to rest for 30 mins. 3 mmol 
EDT (546 mg, 0.489 mL) was then added into to the suspension and took 2 mL mixed solution 
into a cuboid polypropylene vial. Then, the plastic vial was typically attached to the power sources 
(AC power supply) with two wired Pt electrodes inside. The applied voltages were operated at 500 
Hz, 16 Vrms for 3 h to generate alternating electric field. Aliquots were collected and analyzed 
using 1H-NMR for calculating the EDT adsorption.
