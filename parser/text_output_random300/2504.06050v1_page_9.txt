and titanium occurs. As demonstrated in the case of hBN18 and MoO370, isotopic enrichment of 
the membranes may enhance the SPhP propagation length and lifetime even further. Besides 
SrTiO3, various perovskite oxide membranes can be synthesized, each with unique optical phonon 
modes and infrared properties. Exploring these membranes could expand capabilities and enable 
ultra-low loss PhPs, enhancing functionality and performance. Another advantage of the 
membranes is the ability to control the growth of epitaxial superlattices, where SrTiO3 layers are 
alternated with other perovskite oxides that have an opposite sign of optical permittivity. The 
optical property of superlattice membrane can be tailored on demand by selecting functional oxide 
layers with varying dielectric functions and controlling the thicknesses ratio of the constituent 
layers. This approach should open avenues to creation of novel optical metamaterials supporting 
low-loss infrared hyperbolic phonon polaritons, with additional confinement and possibility of 
engineering the optical density of states in photonic applications.
