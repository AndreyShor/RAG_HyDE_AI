Table 4.5: The N3LO cross-sections and uncertainties for the inclusive gauge boson production processes
displayed in Figs. 4.25 to 4.27 and evaluated using the NNPDF4.0 and MSHT20 aN3LO
PDFs. We show the percentage total theory uncertainty δth, obtained adding in quadrature
the 7-point scale variation MHOUs and the PDF uncertainty δPDF (not including MHOUs
in the fit), which is also separately provided. In the case of NNPDF4.0 the value of δPDF
with MHOUs in the fit is also listed. All uncertainties are expressed as percentage of the
cross-section. We finally show the error ∆exact

N3LO, and the estimate of this error ∆app

code [278] for different ranges in the final-state dilepton invariant mass, Q = mℓℓfor NC
and Q = mℓν for CC scattering. Fig. 4.25 displays the inclusive NC DY cross-section pp →
γ∗/Z →ℓ+ℓ−and Figs. 4.26 and 4.27 the CC cross-sections pp →W ± →ℓ±νℓ. We consider
one low-mass bin (30 GeV ≤Q ≤60 GeV), the mass peak bin (60 GeV ≤Q ≤120 GeV), and
two high-mass bins (120 GeV ≤Q ≤300 GeV and 2 TeV ≤Q ≤3 TeV), relevant for high-mass
new physics searches. In all cases, we compare the NLO, NNLO, and aN3LO predictions using
NNPDF4.0 and MSHT20 PDFs determinations, with the same perturbative order in matrix
element and PDFs, and also the aN3LO result with NNLO PDFs, and then we compare the
aN3LO with NNPDF4.0 aN3LO PDFs with and without MHOUs. The values of cross-sections and
uncertainties are collected in Table 4.5.
In general, we observe a good perturbative convergence, with predictions at two subsequent
orders in agreement within uncertainties, and generally improved convergence upon including
MHOUs on the PDF. Predictions based on NNPDF4.0 and MSHT20 are always consistent with
each other within uncertainties. From Figs. 4.25 to 4.27 and Table 4.5 we can draw three
main conclusions. First, in many cases differences between the NNLO and N3LO predictions
tend to be reduced when using consistently the appropriate PDFs at each order, rather than
NNLO PDFs with N3LO matrix elements (though in some cases the results are unchanged). For
instance, for the two lowest mℓℓbins for NC production aN3LO PDFs drive upwards the N3LO
prediction, making it closer to the NNLO result. Second, the difference between PDFs with and
without MHOUs, while moderate, remains non-negligible even at N3LO, where it starts being
comparable to the overall uncertainty, and thus it must be included in precision calculations.
Third, the impact of using aN3LO instead of NNLO PDFs is actually smaller than the guess based
on the estimate of Eq. (4.30).
