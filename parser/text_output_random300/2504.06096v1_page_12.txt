Figure 5: Distribution of (left) the dimuon invariant mass of Σ+ →pµ+µ−decays in a signal
region of ±2 times the resolution on mpµ+µ−, for which no background subtraction is applied.
The local p-value (right) is shown in each dimuon invariant-mass window, obtained as described
in the text. The horizontal dashed lines correspond to the p-values of one and two standard
deviations.
A.3
Scan for a structure in the dimuon invariant mass
A scan for a possible resonant structure in the dimuon invariant mass is performed
as described in the main text. The distribution of Σ+ →pµ+µ−candidates in the
signal region as a function of the dimuon invariant mass is shown in Fig. 5(left). The
mass resolution σ(mµ+µ−) as a function of the dimuon invariant mass is shown in the
Supplemental Material [52]. The local p-value of the background-only hypothesis obtained
from the scan for possible structure is shown in Fig. 5(right) as a function of the dimuon
invariant mass.

Fit to the Σ+ →pπ0 invariant mass
The extended maximum-likelihood fits to the corrected pπ0 invariant-mass distribution in
data for the TIS and TOS samples are reported in Fig. 6.
