mations in active crystals [73]. In this study, we charac-
terize crystal deformations using non-affine fluctuations,
deriving a scaling law in terms of activity Λ and den-
sity.
Our scaling argument predicts a Λ2 dependence,
confirmed over three decades through detailed numerical
simulations – one of the key achievements of this paper.
The non-affine parameter diverges at large Λ, signaling
defect proliferation and activated melting of the solid to a
hexatic phase, marked by vanishing shear modulus, solid
order, and eventually the hexatic order. The softening
and melting are further characterized analyzing the pro-
liferation of topological defects. Finally, we propose lo-
cally tuned activity as a means to control non-affinity
and the mechanical properties of a solid.

MODEL
We consider an excluded volume solid in two dimen-
sions characterized by a triangular lattice and quasi-
long-range order, composed of N = nxny particles in-
teracting via the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) po-
tential [74, 75], U(rij) = 4ϵ[(σ/rij)12 −(σ/rij)6] + ϵ for
|rij| < rc = 21/6σ and U(rij) = 0 otherwise. The system
is maintained at high density ρ = N/LxLy with mean
inter-particle separation a = [2/
√
3ρ]1/2.
The equilib-
rium phase diagram, based on the WCA potential, re-
veals that for fixed temperature kBT/ε = 1.0, the solid
undergoes a continuous BKTHNY transition to a hexatic
phase at ρσ2 = 0.92, followed by first-order melting to a
liquid at ρσ2 = 0.906 [76].
We investigate the behavior of an equilibrium solid
at high density (ρσ2 ≥1) under self-propulsion, mod-
eled by Active Brownian Particles (ABP). Each parti-
cle moves with self-propulsion speed v0 in a direction
ˆni = cos θi(t), sin θi(t), with the angle θi(t) evolving via
rotational diffusion. The dynamics of the i-th particle is
governed by the following coupled Langevin equations:
dri(t) = v0ˆni(t)dt −µ∇i

jϵRi
U(rij)dt +
p
2Dtdt dBi(t)
dθi(t) =

2Drdt dBr
i (t),
(1)
where Dt and Dr are the translational and rotational
diffusivities, and dBi(t) and dBr
i (t) are independent and
univariate Gaussian white noise terms with mean zero.
The Euler-Maruyama method is used to directly inte-
grate the dimensionless forms of the above equations
(see Appendix-A) in numerical simulations. The units
of energy, length, and time are set by ϵ, σ, τu = σ2/µϵ.
The system property is controlled by the following di-
mensionless parameters: activity Λ = v0σ/µϵ, transla-
tional diffusivity ˜Dt = Dt/µϵ, and orientational diffusiv-
ity ˜Dr = Drσ2/µϵ. In this paper, we focus on the impact
of activity Λ, by setting ˜Dr = 3, ˜Dt = 1, and ρσ2 = 1.1,
unless otherwise specified.

NON-AFFINE PARAMETER
The non-affine fluctuation χ0 at lattice position R0
is defined within a coarse-graining volume Ωcontaining
neighbors {Ri} (see Fig. 1c). Instantaneous positions r0
and {ri} yield displacements u0 = r0 −R0 and ui =
ri −Ri relative to reference coordinates {Ri} on an ideal
triangular lattice. The local strain matrix E is obtained
by minimizing the mean-square difference D2 between
the observed relative displacements ∆i = ui −u0 and
estimated displacements E[Ri −R0] [17],
χ0 =
X
i
(∆i −E[Ri −R0])2 .

Note that D has the dimension of length.
After min-
imization, the αβ-th component of the affine strain is
given by
Em

where
xαβ =

i=1
(riα −r0α) (Riβ −R0β) ,
yαβ =
NΩ

i=1
(Riα −R0α) (Riβ −R0β) .
The residual D2 value using the minimized E denoted
by Em in Eq.(3) gives the non-affine fluctuation χ0 of the
0-th particle [17, 35]:
χ0 =
X
i
(∆i −Em[Ri −R0])2 .

A projection operator formalism [36] showed that this
procedure projects the relative displacement field ∆i onto
mutually orthogonal subspaces of the affine strain tensor
Em and the non-affine parameter χ0. The global non-
affine parameter X = N −1 PN
i=1 χi is the system average
with χi denoting non-affine parameter associated with i-
th particle. Note that χ and X have dimensions of length
squared, which we use in the next section to develop a
scaling argument.

Scaling analysis
In an equilibrium harmonic solid with spring constant
k and temperature kBT, the characteristic length scale
of displacement fluctuations is ℓ2 = kBT
k , and the mean
non-affine parameter is ⟨χ⟩eq ∼ℓ2 [36]. With transla-
tional diffusion Dt = µkBT, similar scaling is expected
in our system, where the elastic constant k, derivable
from U ′′(a), increases with density.
