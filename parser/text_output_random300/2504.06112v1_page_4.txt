influence of external factors on individual decision-making in different systems has gained
significant attention, leading to important findings [37–39]. However, existing studies have
yet to examine the impact of an advantageous environment on cooperative behavior under
multiple dilemmas. In real-world scenarios, when individuals face multiple dilemmas, they
aim to minimize losses and mitigate risks. Rational individuals will only consider environ-
mental factors if the environmental payoff exceeds their personal payoff. In this study, we
refer to the social neighborhood of an individual in the system as the social environment,
or environment for short, and define an environment as advantageous when an individual’s
environmental payoff is higher than their own payoff.
In multiple dilemmas, not only does the social environment influence individual decision-
making, but an individual’s resources also play a crucial role in shaping their strategic
behavior. Here, resources refer to the material necessities required for the survival of or-
ganisms and individuals in both nature and human society, such as food, water, habitat,
and money. These resources are essential for survival and have played a fundamental role
in biological evolution. The primary objective of living organisms is to acquire as many
resources as possible to ensure survival and reproduction. However, limited resources often
lead to competition, particularly among individuals or groups. In competitive environments,
cooperative behavior can emerge spontaneously as a means to maintain collective benefits
and defend against external threats. Thus, resource dynamics is inherently intertwined with
strategic interactions: resource acquisition depends on game outcomes, and the amount of
resources an individual possesses influences their strategic choices. Moreover, competition
for resources can create substantial imbalances, making unfair distribution a pressing issue
of concern in modern society. To address the challenge of equitable resource allocation,
scholars across various disciplines have conducted extensive research. For example, Loumio-
tis et al. [40] investigated the allocation of backhaul network resources in base stations using
evolutionary game theory, modeling interactions between users and base stations. Similarly,
Semasinghe et al. [41] proposed a distributed resource allocation scheme based on evolu-
tionary game theory (EGT) for small cells within a macro-cellular network. Additionally,
Hazarika et al. [42] introduced a priority-sensitive task offloading and resource allocation
scheme for Internet of Vehicles networks.
In this paper, we propose a multi-game model incorporating an advantageous social envi-
ronment mechanism using an adaptive control method, as well as resource dynamics under
