THEORETICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN QUASI-TOPOLOGICAL NUMBER AND FIDELITY
11.1
Mathematical Definition of Quasi-topological Number
Set the parameter space to be a tight manifold X with the boundary ∂X corresponding to experimental constraints,
then the weak topological number is defined as:
νqua = 1
2π
Z
S−Sref
F ∈Z
(S41)
where:
• F = dA is the Berry curvature, A is the Berry connection.
• S, Sref are the relative 2-dimensional chains enclosed by the open path and the reference path, respectively.

Geometric Phase Representation of Fidelity

Fidelity Calculation Steps
1. Parametric path design: Non-closed path λ(t) = (µ(t), ∆(t)), such as:
µ(t) = µ0 + δµ sin(πt/T),
∆(t) = ∆0 + δ∆(1 −cos(πt/T))
