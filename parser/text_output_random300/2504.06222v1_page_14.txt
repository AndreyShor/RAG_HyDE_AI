Videos 
Video S1. In-situ SEM imaging of FAPbBr3 single crystal under the e-beam radiation of 1E9 e/µm3 
@ 10 keV, 3E9 e/µm3 @ 10 keV, 8E9 e/µm3 @ 10 keV, 8E9 e/µm3 @ 12 keV, and 8E9 e/µm3 @ 
15 keV (The video is sped up 16 times). 
 
Video S2. In-situ SEM imaging of MAPbBr3 single crystal under the e-beam radiation of 1E9 
e/µm3 @ 10 keV, 3E9 e/µm3 @ 10 keV, 8E9 e/µm3 @ 10 keV, 8E3 @ 12 keV, and 8E9 e/µm3 @ 
15 keV (The video is sped up 16 times). 
 
Video S3. In-situ GI-XRD patterns of FAPbBr3 single crystal under the X-ray beam radiation of 
5E9 ph/µm3 @ 11 keV, 14 keV, and 17 keV (Each XRD pattern is displayed for 1 second, and the 
real time interval of each two patterns is 120 seconds). 
 
Video S4. In-situ GI-XRD patterns of MAPbBr3 single crystal under the X-ray beam radiation of 
5E9 ph/µm3 @ 11 keV, 14 keV, and 17 keV (Each XRD pattern is displayed for 1 second, and the 
real time interval of each two patterns is 120 seconds).
