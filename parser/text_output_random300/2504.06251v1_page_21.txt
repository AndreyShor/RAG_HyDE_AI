Methods
Sample preparation and characterization. Few-layer RG flakes were mechanically exfoliated
from natural graphite onto SiO2/Si substrates, and their thickness was determined by optical re-
flectance contrast and AFM measurement. The RG domains were identified by using SNOM or
infrared imaging, and subsequently isolated from the surrounding BG by AFM tip48. We sequen-
tially picked up the BN flake and R5G using polypropylene carbonate (PPC) film. During this
process, the straight edges of the R5G flakes were intentionally aligned at specific angles with
respect to the bottom BN to form a moir´e superlattice or non-aligned sample. The R5G/BN was
then flipped and transferred onto a clean SiO2/Si substrate, which was then annealed at 350 ◦C in
vacuum to remove the PPC film underneath the heterostructure. Metal electrodes were deposited
following standard e-beam lithography. During the entire sample preparation process, the rhom-
bohedral stacking was frequently checked and verified by SNOM measurements to ensure that the
stacking order remains the same.
ARPES measurements. NanoARPES measurements were performed at beamline ANTARES of
the Synchrotron SOLEIL in France and beamline I05 of the Diamond Light Source in the UK
with beam sizes smaller than 1 µm. Before NanoARPES measurements, the few-layer RG samples
