accessibility of the spin-z correlation function did not rely on the Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation, nor did it depend on
V , 0. In particular, one can derive a similar Bethe–Salpeter–type equations for other spin correlation functions Cαβ. However,
since thermalization properties of the spin degrees of freedom are not anticipated to differ across different components, the spin-
z correlation functions were sufficient for the current work. For more details on how higher-order correlation function can be
extracted within the 2PI formalism, we refer to [135–137].

FIG. S1. (a) Absolute values of the “occupation numbers” n at τ = 140 for photon and spin degrees of freedom, respectively. The shaded
areas represent the frequency windows (ωmin, ωmax) taken in Eq. (S.25) for the respective degree of freedom. For consistency, we use the same
frequency windows for all the parametric regimes considered in this work. We note that, since the definition of n involves the quotient of F
and ρ, cf. Eq. (2) and the subsequent discussion, the high-frequency region, where the value of ρ drops below the numerical tolerance, suffers
from the numerical artifacts and is thus not shown here. (b) Effective spin temperatures extracted from the local correlation functions on each
sublattice. The two sublattices quickly thermalize with each other, exhibiting no qualitative difference throughout the entire dynamics.
EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURES
In order to reduce the influence of numerical errors when extracting effective temperatures (cf. discussion in the main
text), we first average the correlation functions over a small time window, ¯F(τ, ω) = T −1

τ−T1/2 dτ′ F(τ′, ω) and ¯ρ(τ, ω) =

R τ+T1/2
τ−T1/2 dτ′ ρ(τ′, ω), with T1 = 8 chosen for the results presented in this work such that it is much smaller than any equilibra-
tion timescale. Therefore, the averaging procedure does not affect the slow dynamics of macroscopic observables (e.g., effective
temperatures). At the same time T1/∆t ≫1, so that each bin contains a statistically significant number of points.
To extract the low-frequency effective temperatures, we then average over the appropriate frequency windows (ωmin, ωmax)
and perform one final temporal averaging in order to reduce the residual oscillations:

We choose T2 = 4 in this work, which effectively smoothens oscillations with frequencies up to 2π/T2 ∼1.6, covering all major
frequencies in the excitation spectra, cf. Fig. 3(b). As before, however, T2 is much smaller than any equilibration timescale.
The frequency windows are chosen as (ωmin, ωmax) ≈(8 · 10−3, 7 · 10−2) and (8 · 10−3, 4 · 10−1) for the photon and spin degrees
of freedom, respectively. In both cases, ωmin corresponds to the smallest available nonzero frequency mode set by the evolution
time τevol = 400. In Fig. S1(a), we show the thermal fits together with the frequency windows (ωmin, ωmax) employed to compute
the effective temperatures Tph and Ts.
While the definition for the photon effective temperature is unambiguous, the spin effective temperature allows for more than
one definition due to its rich spatial structure. In this work, to define the spin temperature, we use on-site correlation functions,
