In this study, we theoretically investigate the influence of polaron interactions on the
linear and nonlinear optical properties of a graphene monolayer placed on a substrate under
the effect of electric and magnetic fields. Our analysis focuses on the optical absorption
coefficient and relative refractive index. The magnetic field is assumed to be translationally
invariant along the y-direction, while the electric field is applied within the graphene plane.
We employ the Lee-Low-Pines formalism to determine the ground-state energy, followed by
the compact density matrix approach to evaluate the optical properties. The manuscript is
structured as follows: Section 2 describes the theoretical model and calculations, Section 3
presents the numerical results and discussion, and Section 4 concludes the study.
Methodology
Model Hamiltonian
Consider a graphene monolayer in the (x, y) plane on which a substrate rests in the presence
of an electric field applied25 in the x-direction and influenced by an inhomogeneous mag-
netic23 field normal to the plane of the graphene, invariant along the y-direction and varying
along the x-axis, ⃗B = B(x, y)ˆez. The vector potential is chosen such that ⃗A(x, y) = A(x)ˆey.
By considering the substrate vibrational modes and their interaction with the charge carriers
of the graphene, the Hamiltonian is written as
H = He + V (r) + Hph + He−ph,
