I.
DERIVATION OF EQ. (3)
We derive Eq. (3) in the main text, by following the argument of Refs. [74, 75]. As explained in the main text, Qt
can be measured by performing the two-time measurement of NR = ∑x≥1 nx. Due to particle conservation, Qt can be
obtained as the difference between the measurement outcomes of NR at time t and time 0, therefore Pr[Qt = n] can
be written in terms of the Born probabilities as follows,
Pr[Qt = n] = ∑
m≥0
Tr[Pm+neLt[PmρPm]],
(S-1)
where ρ is an initial density matrix and Pm is the projection operator onto the eigenspace of NR with the eigenvalue
m. Using the above equation, we have
⟨eλQt⟩= ∑
n∈Z
eλnPr[Qt = n] = Tr[eλNReLt[e−λNRρ′]]
(S-2)
with ρ′ ∶= ∑m≥0 PmρPm. For the step initial condition ρini, it holds that ρ′
ini = ρini. Thus we obtain Eq. (3) in the
main text.
II.
PROOF OF THE ω-DEPENDENCE
We prove the ω-dependence. Namely, we show that ⟨eλQt⟩can be expanded in terms of ω = ρa(eλ −1) + ρb(e−λ −
1) + ρa(eλ −1)ρb(e−λ −1) as
⟨eλQt⟩= ∑
n≥0
qn(t)ωn
(S-3)
with
qn(t) =
∑
y1<⋯<yn≤0<x1<⋯<xn
⟨x∣eLt[∣y⟩⟨y∣]∣x⟩.
