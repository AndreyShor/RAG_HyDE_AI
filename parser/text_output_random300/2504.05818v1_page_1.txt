After treating hybrid as a three-body system, we recalculate the spectra and decay widths of the
1−+ light hybrids via the Gauss Expansion Method (GEM). Our result shows that, after adding
into only one more parameter mg=450 MeV, i.e., the constituent gluon mass, we can reproduce
nearly all the results in our previous work by just using the model parameters from meson spectra
calculation, which shows the unification of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). As a result, π1(1600)
and η1(1855) may not be explained as 1−+ hybrids simultaneously, and the η1(1855) observed by
BESIII may not be a hybrid. In addition, we predict an existence of a hybrid η1(1640), which can
be verified by searching the a1(1260)π channel. Furthermore, to search for an isospin-0 and an
isospin- 1
2 hybrid, the golden channels may be K1(1270) ¯K and K1(1270)π, respectively.

INTRODUCTION
As the fundamental theory of strong interaction, Quan-
tum Chromodynamics (QCD) reveals us all the possi-
ble interactions between quarks, anti-quarks, and glu-
ons. Thus, theoretically, it can present us explanations
on nearly all the phenomena in strong interaction field.
However, due to the complex mathematical structure of
this theory itself, direct calculations that based on the
first principle are usually too difficult to carry on. As a
result, various phenomenological models that obey the
basic requirements of QCD are successfully proposed,
which stands for our further understandings on the strong
interactions.
Among these QCD based phenomenological models,
potential model is one of the most successful ones, where
quark model, one-gluon exchange potential that directly
derived from QCD Lagrangian, and a phenomenological
description on color confinement are combined together.
After considering different modifications such as Gold-
stone boson exchange [1–5], hidden local symmetry [6, 7],
scalar meson exchange [8–10], semi-relativistic or rela-
tivistic [11–14], unquenched effects [15–20], etc., a global
description on the spectra of traditional hadrons (mesons
and baryons) can be actually well obtained. Especially,
for the low-lying states, their masses can be very nicely
reproduced [1–3, 7].
However, with the rapid development of experiments,
there appears a large number of hadronic states that can-
not be contained into the traditional quark model, al-
though their existences are permitted by QCD. Among
these states, one kind of the convincible ones might
be those with exotic quantum numbers.

three JP C = 1−+ states π1(1400/1600) [21–34], π1(2015)
[35, 36], and a new iso-scalar state η1(1855) that was ob-
served by the BESIII Collaboration in the J/ψ →γηη′
process [37, 38].
Apparently, with the experimental observations of
these three states, the classification of them naturally be-
comes an issue in the community. Nowadays, there are
two main opinions for their interpretations, one is the
tetraquark state [39–43], the other is hybrid [44–53], or
a mixture of tetraquark and hybrid [54]. The conception
of tetraquark state is actually a simple generalization of
the quark model, which means the hadron is composed
by four constituent quarks. While hybrid is a little dif-
ferent, as this kind of state is composed by serval valence
quarks and gluons, where the simplest case is q¯qg.
Thus, for hybrid, here instantly comes a question, i.e.,
how we understand constituent gluon, and at least, where
is the location of its proper mass. As we have mentioned
before, the application of QCD on the potential model
can reproduce spectra of low-lying traditional hadrons
well. Thus, considering the unification of QCD, we be-
lieve that if we have proper constituent gluon mass, after
adding it into the potential model, together with interac-
tion between (anti-)quark, we should give proper expla-
nations or predictions on the hybrids without modifying
the model parameters in quark model anymore (or do a
fine-tuning at most), especially for the low-lying hybrids.
Fortunately, studies on the effective mass of gluon had
already been carried out [55–57]. As a result, it is pointed
in Refs. [55–57] that gluons can be massive via Schwinger
mechanism, i.e., non-perturbative effect of the gauge field
itself will bring a correction into the gluon propagator
and resulting into a mass term, and it is extracted to be
mg ≈1
2mp, with mp being the mass of proton. More-
over, it brings us that for quarks, the effective masses are
mu/d ≈1
3mp, ms ≈500 MeV, etc. [56].
Obviously, these effective masses of up/down and
strange quarks that Schwinger mechanism presents us are
very close to the commonly used values in constituent
quark model. Since in QCD Lagrangian, there is only
