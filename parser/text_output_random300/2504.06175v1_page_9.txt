averaging over random iterations, as we did in the pre-
vious section. However, an effective T1/T2 idling error is
not obtained by simply waiting on an actual device; due
to ZZ interactions between neighboring pairs the Bell
state fidelity can strongly degrade. We show a simple
example of this in Fig.(8). Here we can get tremendous
improvement in the Bell fidelity, but this is because we
allowed the Bell fidelity to decrease via a coherent error
term; the purity of the state is unchanged. One has to
be careful of similar situations where distillation provides
an apparent benefit, but where improvement could more
easily be achieved without post-selection. In this exam-
ple, the ZZ coherent error term can be also be canceled
by applying staggered dynamical decoupling (DD) [50–
52] (see App. G, Fig. 13a). With staggered DD, the cir-
cuit is now well described by T1 and T2 errors.
Once we apply staggered DD, typical data is shown in
Fig. 9 with dotted lines. We see some natural features of
the experiments. One, the starting Bell fidelity is lower
than one due to the creation and swap operations (for in-
stance see the Bell fidelity in Figs. 9a and 9b at t = 0 is
less than one). Second, there is a natural asymmetry in
the initial fidelity due to the variability of noise parame-
ters between qubits (for instance the Bell fidelity of the
two bell pairs in Fig. 9b are unequal). Third, depending
on the distillation protocol used, Z2B or X2B, one may
or may not see broad improvement in Bell fidelity (see
Fig. 9d with improvement and 9c without); however we
do not yet see broad across the device. To understand
these features better we look to build a more involved
device noise model.

Device Model and Numerics
To build a more involved device model we must include
T1/T2 noise [44, 45] (see App. F for a mathematical de-
scription) during the wait periods. These include when
the swap is occurring, when the Bell states are idle and
when the measurements are occurring. Furthermore, due
to the effect described in Ref. [53] it’s not enough to use
the bare T1/T2 even though we performed staggered echo
sequences. We must still include the ZZ terms and sim-
ulate the echo sequence to get the proper decay of the
Bell states during the wait. We continue to add in the
gate and measurement noise as described in Sec. III A.
We pull the ZZ, T1, T2, gate times and measurement er-
ror from the backend of the device (see Tables III and IV
in App. E).
For recurrence Z2B the simulations are given by the
solid lines in Fig. 9a and we notice fairly good agree-
ment between the experimental and numerical simula-
tions. Confirming the general trend of the data is con-
sistent with the calibration data.
However, the figure
