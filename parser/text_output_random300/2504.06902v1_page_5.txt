They then proceed to estimate two important parameters
of the channel: the BER and the Phase Error Rate. The
average probabilities for a successful detection and for
systematic error in the protocol are presented in Fig. 5.

Bases Match: Error and Success Probabilities
FIG. 4: Bases match. Using the information in Table II, we
calculate the average probability of a successful detection for
Types 0 or 1, as well as the probability of a systematic error
for these detection types. For the latter, we average the
probabilities that an input of Type 1 (0), 3, or 4 in Table II
results in a detection of Type 0 (1).

IS THE PROTOCOL SECURE?
We offer only a partial answer to this question. By
decomposing the protocol into the Bases Mismatch and
Bases Match cases, the security of the first part di-
rectly follows from the security proofs in [6].
For the
Bases Match case, however, we can only establish a non-
rigorous connection to concepts derived in [11].
A.
Bases Mismatch
Assuming the protocol applies only in the Bases Mis-
match case, the plots in Fig. 3 represent the probability
of successfully distributing a key to a pair of users and
the associated systematic error. From these plots, it is
clear that the key generation rate for the Mismatch pro-
tocol is lower than that of the one in [6], and the presence
of a systematic error further reduces the SKR. However,
the security parameters and the formula for estimating
the SKR from [6] still apply here, with the necessary ad-
justment for the inclusion of the systematic error factor
in the estimations.
In more detail, for the Bases Mismatch protocol, the
states sent by the three users are unentangled. As seen
in Tables I, IV, and V, the bit value of the unmatched
user does not correlate with the key of the matched users.
Therefore, if the unmatched state is attributed to Eve,
it does not increase her knowledge or influence over the
protocol.
One can re-design the virtual protocol from
Section 5 of [6] by taking the density matrix represent-
ing the ensemble of two different encodings for the un-
matched user and putting it in product with the states of
the paired users and Eve. This approach preserves ∆ini,
the key security parameter of the protocol that quantifies
the basis mismatch flaw.
On the other hand, the input of the unmatched state
introduces noise into the output of the paired users,
thereby inducing the aforementioned systematic error
(Fig. 3).
To calculate the secure key generation rate,
one can still apply the formula (10) from [6], with the bit
error rates, δX and δ′Y , now augmented due to the sys-

mismatch and match. After announcing the detection type
and selected bases, an event is discarded if the triplet of
bases does not match the detection type as shown in this
table. The occurrence of two ∧along a row implies that both
detectors simultaneously fire.
