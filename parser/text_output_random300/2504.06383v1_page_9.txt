the −x boundary enters the domain and transitions to an X-mode upon entering the plasma. The
initial plasma region from x = −13 to x = −5 c/ωpe is marked by the red dashed lines. (b) Wave

excitation, the microwave primarily heats electrons in the perpendicular direction, as evident
from the phase space density difference. Once whistler waves are generated, they rapidly
scatter electrons through cyclotron resonance, transferring energy from the perpendicular
to the parallel direction, suppressing the instability and leading to a noticeable increase in
