Fig. 3 Spectrum of negative parity tetraquarks predicted in Ref. [27]. Note that the masses of the 1−−states used as input are slightly
different compared to those employed in the other sections, however, an adaption would not change the overall picture. Note that the
quantum numbers 0−−and 1−+ are exotic—they cannot be reached from quark-antiquark states. Fig. from Ref. [11].

If the (anti-)diquark structures can be treated as well defined building blocks of the emerging hadrons, to estimate the spectrum of compact
tetraquarks one can straightforwardly write down the pertinent interactions within the given hadron in analogy to what is known from atomic
physics as
H = 2m[cq] + 2(κcq)¯3[(⃗S c · ⃗S q) + (⃗S ¯c · ⃗S ¯q)] + 2(κc¯q)[(⃗S c · ⃗S ¯q′) + (⃗S ¯c · ⃗S q)] + 2κ¯qq(⃗S q · ⃗S ¯q′) + 2κ¯cc(⃗S c · ⃗S ¯c) + BQ

where the first term captures the diquark masses and the next four account for the spin-spin interactions between the different quarks in
the hadron. The following two terms need to be added to describe states with inter-diquark angular momenta larger than zero [27], where
⃗S = ⃗S Q + ⃗S ¯Q with ⃗S Q = ⃗S c + ⃗S q and analogously for ⃗S ¯Q. Finally, the tensor-operator is defined via
S 12 = 3(⃗S Q · ⃗n)(⃗S ¯Q · ⃗n) −⃗S Q · ⃗S ¯Q ,
where ⃗n is either ⃗r/r or ⃗q/q for calculations in coordinate space or momentum space, respectively, with ⃗r the distance between the building
blocks and ⃗q the momentum transfer. The matrix elements of the above operators can be evaluated with standard methods and the strength
parameters need to be determined from experiment. The label on the first spin-spin term indicates that in the model sketched here the
diquarks are considered in the color [¯3] representation only. Heavy quark spin symmetry suggests that κcq/κq¯q ∼Mq/Mc and κc¯c/κq¯q ∼
(Mq/Mc)2.
We start with a discussion of S wave states (L = 0). The Hamiltonian of Eq. (8) is diagonal in the JPC = 1++ and 2++ channels and

having identified the 1++ state with the χc1(3872) aka X(3872) and estimated the various spin-spin interactions from the masses of regular
charmonia. It is furthermore argued that the 2++ state can be identified with the tensor state observed at 3940 MeV. The given interaction
predicts a 1+−state at 3882 MeV which is nicely consistent with the mass of the isovector state Tc¯c1(3900)+ also known as Zc(3900).
However, the corresponding spin partner state is predicted at 3754 MeV, significantly lighter than the X(3872), while it is observed experi-
mentally more than 100 MeV above, namely at 4020 MeV. To accommodate this, in Refs. [28, 29] it was proposed that contrary to the heavy
quark spin symmetry scaling quoted above, all spin-spin interactions but the first should be negligible. A justification for this unexpected
pattern was provided later in Ref. [30], where it was argued that the diquarks are separated by some potential well, no allowing the short
ranged spin-spin interactions to operate between different diquarks—also the dynamical diquark picture proposed in Ref. [31] leads to a
sizeable separation of diquark and anti-diquark within the exotic hadron. Then the strength parameter of the remaining spin-spin interaction
is estimated from the mass difference of Zc(3900) and Zc(4020) aka Tc¯c1(3900)+ and Tc¯c1(4020)+, respectively, to be (κcq)¯3 = 67 MeV [28],
about three times larger than the value provided in Ref. [26], where it was extracted from the Σc-Λc mass difference. In this way the 2++ and
the second 1+−state are predicted to have a mass quite close to the D∗¯D∗threshold (in line with the prediction in the molecular approach as
detailed below).
The building blocks for tetraquarks containing a heavy quark and its anti-quark with negative parity are still the ones provided in Eqs. (4),
(6), and (7). The negative parity is then provided by an angular momentum between the diquark and the anti-diquark. For charge and flavor
neutral states an odd angular momentum changes also the charge parity. Thus, one get e.g. five states with JPC = 1−−: Two by adding
