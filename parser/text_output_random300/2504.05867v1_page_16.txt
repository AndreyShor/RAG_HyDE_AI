model, emission is enhanced due to relativistic beaming,
and as the blob follows a helical path within the jet, the
viewing angle changes over time. Such helical jet tra-
jectories can result from jet bending, wiggling motion,
or the presence of helical magnetic fields within the jet,
leading to periodic emission patterns. Consequently, the
blob’s motion causes a continuous variation in the view-
ing angle relative to the observer’s line of sight, which
can be characterized as
cos θobs(t) = sinϕ sinψ cos(2πt/Pobs) + cosϕ cosψ (26)
where ϕ represents the pitch angle between the blob mo-
tion and the jet axis, ψ is the viewing angle or inclination
angle between the observer’s line of sight and jet axis,
and Pobs represents the observed period of oscillations
in the light curve. Due to the helical motion of emitting
region in the jet, the Doppler factor undergoes temporal
variations, defined as
δ =
1
Γ (1 −β cosθobs(t))
(27)
where, Γ =
1
√
1−β2 represents the bulk Lorentz factor
and β = vjet/c. Following this, the observed flux is de-
fined as Fν ∝δ3. The relationship between the observed
period and rest frame period of blob can be defined by
the following expression:
Prest =
Pobs
1 −β cosψ cosϕ
(28)
The blazer ON 246 is BL Lac type, therefore, we con-
sidered typical values of ϕ = 2◦, ψ = 5◦(E. Sobacchi
et al. 2017; J. Zhou et al. 2018; A. Sarkar et al. 2019;
R. Prince et al. 2023), and Γ = 4.85 as estimated above.
The period of oscillations in the rest frame to be Prest ∼
78.85 yr.
As discussed earlier, F. M. Rieger (2004) outlined
three potential mechanisms, one of which suggests that
if the observed periodicity exceeds 1 year, it can be rea-
sonably attributed to the helical motion of the jet driven
by the orbital motion of an SMBBH system.
Using
the expression in Equation 16 and periodicity in rest
frame, we estimate the mass of the primary black hole
to be M ∼1.083 × 109, 4.314 × 109, 1.71 × 1010M⊙for
R=1,10, and 100, respectively. The estimated primary
black hole mass in SMBBH for R=1,10 is consistent with
the derived mass value utilizing different approaches as
described in section 7.
Therefore, our comprehensive
analysis suggests that the observed periodicity is most
likely attributed to the jet being driven by the orbital
motion of the SMBBH system.
9. CONCLUSION
In this study, we investigated the γ-ray and optical
emission of the blazar ON 246 over the period of 11.6 yr
(MJD 55932–60081). The key findings of our analysis
are summarized as follows:
• We identified a potential quasi-periodic signal of
approximately 746 days in the γ-ray and optical
emissions of blazar ON 246 with a significance level
exceeding 3σ.
• Cross-correlation analysis reveals a strong correla-
tion between γ-ray and optical emissions, indicat-
ing a common origin for both. Additionally, we
assessed the significance of the peak in the cross-
correlation plot, finding it to be at the 4σ level.
• We estimated the black hole mass range of ON
246 to be (0.142 −8.22) × 109 M⊙based on the
shortest variability timescale observed in the γ-ray
band. Furthermore, using the rest-frame damping
timescales in the γ-ray and optical emissions, the
black hole masses were found to be (7.3 ± 6) ×
109 M⊙and (1.56 ± 0.66) × 108 M⊙, respectively.
Both estimated values fall within the derived black
hole mass range.
• To explain the observed QPO, we explored var-
ious scenarios that could potentially account for
the flux modulation with a period of ∼746 days
in both light curves. Our analysis suggests that
a non-ballistic jet driven by the orbital motion of
a close supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH)
system is a plausible explanation for the long-term
periodic variations observed in the light curves.
