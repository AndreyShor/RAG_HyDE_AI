Table 1.1: Electroweak charges. ef denotes the electric charge, I3 the third component of the electroweak
isospin. Note that for antiparticles all the charges are reversed.
interaction is dominant for particles with low momentum and why quarks are only observed
inside bound colorless states, i.e. mesons and baryons (often referred ad QCD confinement).
In principle also the mass of the heavy quarks, i.e. the ones with mq > ΛQCD, should depend on
the scale. However, in a realistic scenario, this effect is much smaller than the strong coupling
running thus, for our purposes, it will be neglected. In the following we assume mc = 1.51 GeV,
mb = 4.92 GeV, mt = 172.5 GeV as pole masses [36].
Other Standard Model parameters.
For completeness, we also list the convention used for
the electroweak coupling of quarks and leptons to the γ, Z and W. We define the interaction
vertex to be on the form −ieΓµ
b,f, with e the electric charge unit. The couplings can then be split
for each fermion f into axial-vector and vector-vector as

with sin2(θW ) = 0.2315 and the corresponding electroweak charges given in Table 1.1. For the
QED coupling we assume a fixed expansion parameter aem = e2/(4π) = 1/137.04.
Finally, note that we treat the charged leptons electrons and muons to be massless and, we
neglect tau effects.
1.2. Deep Inelastic scattering
The simplest type of interaction involving hadrons in the initial state is the electron-proton
scattering. The spectrum of the cross-section for energies much smaller than the proton mass
