Figure 4. The folded Fermi-LAT and ASAS-SN light curves
of ON 246 with a period of 746 and 757 days are shown in
the top and bottom panels, respectively. The dashed blue
line represents the mean value, and the sine functions (red)
with frequencies of 0.00134 and 0.00132 day−1 were fitted to
the folded γ-ray and optical light curves, respectively. Two
full period cycles are shown for better clarity.
each frequency value, which correspond to the 1σ, 2σ,
3σ, and 4σ significance level. In this first approach, the
significance level of the dominant peak in γ-ray LSP sur-
passes the 3σ and just touches the 3σ significance level
in ASAS-SN LSP.
In the second approach, considering that AGN vari-
ability is stochastic and well-characterized by a red
noise process, we employed the Damped Random Walk
(DRW) model to describe both light curves and deter-
mine the optimal model parameters, including the am-
plitude and damping timescale. Using the EzTao pack-
age, we simulated 10,000 synthetic light curves with a
sampling rate consistent with the real observations. Af-
ter generating these synthetic light curves, we computed
Lomb-Scargle periodograms (LSPs) for each, following
the same procedure as for the original γ-ray and ASAS-
SN light curves. The significance levels were then esti-
mated using the same methodology as described earlier.
From this analysis, the peaks at 0.00134 day−1 in γ-
ray LSP, while the peak at 0.00132 day−1 in the optical
LSP surpasses the 4σ threshold. Additionally, we cal-
culated the spectral window periodogram by construct-
ing a light curve with a total number of time stamps
ten times larger than the original within the observed
temporal frame. In this synthetic light curve, the time
stamps matching the original observations were assigned
a value of one, while all others were set to zero. Fur-
ther, we applied the LSP method to generate the peri-
odogram, as shown in pink in Figure 10.
6. GAMMA-RAY/OPTICAL CROSS
CORRELATIONS
We investigate the possible time lags between the γ-
ray and optical light curves of ON 246 utilizing the in-
terpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF: B. M. Pe-
terson et al. (1998, 2004)), which is one of the commonly
used methods in the time-series analysis of AGNs. As
we know, AGN light curves generally are not regularly
sampled in time but are discretely sampled N times at
time stamps ti, where ti+1 −ti = ∆t for all values
1 ≤i ≤N −1. ICCF method emerges as a powerful
technique to estimate the time-leg between two-time se-
ries. The method uses the linear interpolation method
to deal with unevenly sampled light curves and calculate
the cross-correlation coefficient as a function of the time
lag for two light curves:

where N is the number of data points in the light
curves L and C. Each light curve has a corresponding
mean value (¯L and ¯C ) and uncertainty (σL and σC).
The ICCF is evaluated for a time lag (τ) in a range
[-1000,1000] days with searching step ∆τ, which should
be smaller than the median sampling time of the light
curves.
We adopted ∆τ=7 days and used the public
PYTHON version of the ICCF, PYCCF (M. Sun et al.
2018) in this study. As applying the ICCF to the light
curves, a strong peak is obtained, and its correspond-
ing centroid is calculated using the ICCF for the time
lags around the peak. We adopted the centroid of the
CCF (τcent) using only time lags with r> 0.8rmax, where
rmax is the peak value of the CCF. The 1σ confidence
on the time lag is estimated using a model-independent
