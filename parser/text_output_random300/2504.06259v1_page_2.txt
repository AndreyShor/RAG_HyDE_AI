FIG. 1: Illustration of sideband transitions and Raman
detunings used in an MS(θ) gate. The hyperfine states
|0⟩and |1⟩are separated with an energy splitting of
ω|1⟩−|0⟩= 12.643 GHz. For a chain of N ions, there are
also 2N radial motional modes k where {k : 0...2N −1},
and each blue (red) mode is characterized by frequency
νk(−νk). The Raman tones applied to the IA beams are
symmetrically detuned from the blue (red) motional
mode k by δk(−δk). We also denote δc(−δc) indicating
the equivalent blue (red) detunings from the carrier
transition such that δk = δc −νk.
2S1/2 |F = 1, mF = 0⟩(|1⟩) serve as the qubit states,
split by 12.6 GHz. We utilize Raman transitions to drive
between the qubit levels for all laser-based gates. The
single-photon detuning of the Raman transition is posi-
tioned between the 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 levels, roughly 33
THz away from 2P1/2. During an MS(θ) gate, motional
sidebands of the two target qubits are addressed by
red- and blue-detuned Raman transitions to implement
the necessary spin-dependent force for the entangling
interaction [3, 4]. As these Raman transitions must be
sensitive to the motion of the ions, they are performed
in a counter-propagating configuration – achieved by
applying a single-toned, all-encompassing beam from
one direction orthogonal to the full length of the chain
(i.e. the ‘global’ beam) and individual addressing (IA)
beams on each of the target ions from the opposite
side. Each of the IA beams consist of two tones, which
are symmetrically blue- and red-detuned by δc from
the qubit splitting (i.e.
carrier transition) as shown
in Fig. 1.
To control these tones we use our custom
control hardware system Octet, an RF system-on-chip
(RFSoC) device that is specifically designed to support
two tones per channel.
Each Octet channel controls
an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) for the global and
IA beams, and provides independent amplitude, phase,
and frequency modulation specified either as splines or
discrete changes.
More details of the beam geometry
and Octet hardware control can be found in Ref. [12].
In support of the discussion that follows we introduce

Here, k denotes any of the 2N motional modes along
the radial directions within a chain of N ions (i.e. two
orthogonal radial principal axes each host a manifold of
N motional modes), ηk,i is the Lamb-Dicke parameter of
mode k for ion i, Ωi is the Rabi drive frequency targeting
ion i, and a†
k and ak are the creation and annihilation
operators of mode k characterized by frequency νk
2π. As
shown in Fig. 1, δk is the detuning of the applied light
from the blue or red sideband resonance frequency of
mode k.

FREQUENCY ROBUSTNESS VIA
GAUSSIAN-PULSE SHAPE AND MODE CHOICE
Motional modes are subject to frequency drift, and so
frequency and amplitude modulation can be utilized as
a tool to combat these drifts and other sources of noise
when the driving field becomes entangled with the ion’s
motional modes [26, 27]. We use amplitude modulation
along with a specific fixed detuning to limit these types
of errors. As described in Ref. [21], we find that using
a spectrally compact pulse shape can minimize displace-
ment errors that result in residual spin-motion entangle-
ment after a gate. This pulse shape requirement is ful-
filled by a Gaussian envelope which is approximated as a
spline and applied to the amplitude of the RF waveform
driving the AOMs.
We choose the fixed frequency such that the detuning
balances contributions to θ from multiple modes. From
this, the gate becomes significantly more robust to vari-
ations in motional frequency up to 10 kHz [21].
This
implementation is robust to symmetric changes in mode
frequencies typical of variations in driving RF power, but
not to antisymmetric changes due to DC voltage or stray
field instability. We choose the detuning for each pair of
ions such that both of the nearest detuned modes,k−, k+,
have strong ηk,i for each of the ions i in the pair and have
signs such that the contributions of the nearest modes
add constructively. More expressly, we select modes such
that |ηi,k+ηj,k+ −ηi,k−ηj,k−| is maximized.
For even numbers of ions, this mode selection criteria
is straightforward within a single radial mode manifold.
However, for odd chain lengths, the center ion does not
participate in antisymmetric modes where the behavior
on either side of the center ion is equal and opposite.
Therefore, we select operating detunings slightly nearer
to a symmetric mode for gates involving the center ion
and forgo the robustness to motional frequency changes
provided by motional mode balancing.
