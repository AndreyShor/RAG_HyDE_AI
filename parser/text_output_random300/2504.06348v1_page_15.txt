Table 1: Instances for all 3 classes of problems considered. Superscripts on the HGH pseudoions indicate the
number of valence electrons. ηtot = (ηval, ηion, η) indicates the total particle counts for electrons, pseudoions,
the sum total of both. The vectors Λ = (Λ1, Λ2, Λ3) (Λ = (Λ1, Λ2, Λ3)) indicate the anisotropic momentum
cutoffs for electrons (pseudoions), and Λtrunc is the anisotropic momentum cutoff for the pseudoion-pseudoion
interaction. The vectors n = (n1, n2, n3) (n = (n1, n2, n3)) indicate the number of qubits in each reciprocal
lattice direction for electrons (pseudoions), and |G| (|G|) indicates the the basis size for electrons (pseudoions).
The super cell types are “Cuboid” with lattice vectors a1(1, 0, 0), a2(0, 1, 0), a3(0, 0, 1) and “Rhombohedron
120◦” with lattice vectors a1(1, 0, 0), a2(- 1

2 , 0), a3(0, 0, 1), with (a1, a2, a3) given in the table. The last
column denotes the total number of qubits (space cost) required for the system, excluding all ancilla needed
in the computation.
3. Water Gas Shift (WGS): The WGS reaction CO + H2O ⇌CO2 + H2 plays a pivotal role in energy
production, the hydrogen economy, and environmental sustainability, making its study essential for
both scientific and industrial advancements. We consider 2 increasingly demanding representations of
bilayer Cu(100) systems of the form 2 × m × m conventional unit cells, where the the center 5 atoms
on the top surface are Cu11 and the rest of the copper atoms are Cu1. Both instances have a single
CO and a single H2O molecule.
In Fig. 2, we compute the quantum resource estimate (QRE) in terms of Toffoli gates for time-evolving
the pseudoion Hamiltonian (Eq. (3)) for each of the 7 instances above for time t (in atomic units) with
evolution error δ. We perform a detailed cost analysis of the time-evolution circuit, neglecting the one-time
and significantly sub-leading costs of initial state preparation and information extraction. Note that QSP-
based time-evolution gives a linear scaling in the simulation time and an additive cost in the log of the inverse
error (details in Sec. 5.2). For molecular identification, a further multiplicative cost in the square root of
the inverse of the (potentially biased) chemical rate has to be included. A detailed analysis of asymptotic
scaling and a discussion of practical quantum resource estimates is given in Sec. 7.
For the smallest instance of NH3BF3 with η = 40, we find the cost per time-step to be ∼4 × 109 Toffolis
with a spatial cost of 808 qubits (excluding ancillae). For the largest instance of DMTM 9 × 9 with η = 845,
we find the cost per time step to be ∼2 × 1012 Toffolis with a spatial cost of 18753 qubits (excluding
ancilla). Elementary chemical processes are likely captured within ≲1ps and so a useful simulation likely
requires ≲4 × 104 time steps, adding an additional few orders of magnitude overhead.
Deploying our
framework on the limited resources available on early generation FTQCs requires careful consideration of
the appropriate problem instances and evolution time, in order to extract scientifically useful information.
Addressing this issue is a subject of future work, perhaps involving co-development of classical methods to
pair with quantum dynamical simulations, as well as further improvements to the quantum algorithm. We
see the above estimates as a starting point for further development.
