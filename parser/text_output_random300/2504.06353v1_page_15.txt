Figure 6. Predictions for the NLL′ TBj ≤T cut theory uncertainty using theory nuisance parame-
ters for the on-shell Z boson production cross section. The predictions are shown split by individual
nuisance parameter contribution (left) and compared with scale variation uncertainties (right).

NNLL′ Implementation
To construct the NNLL′ TNP uncertainty estimate, we shall assume the size of the N3LL′
ingredients follows a similar pattern as observed for the NNLL′ ones, so that we can use the
variations in table 1, and also just use the variations in the TNPs for the soft ingredients
to get a reasonable estimate of the total TNP uncertainty. This is possibly a conservative
estimate at NNLL′ – in ref. [59] (see also ref. [37]) it was observed that for the (rapidity)
anomalous dimension for pTj, the leading log(R) jet clustering term is somewhat smaller
at O(α3
s) than the corresponding term at O(α2
s), so if this pattern extends to TB/Cj and
the full jet clustering correction, we overestimate the uncertainty associated with γS2.
Figure 7 shows comparisons of the NNLL′ theory uncertainty using scale variations
and our (likely conservative) TNP approach. We observe that above the nonperturbative
region, the MaxDev and TNP uncertainty estimates agree fairly well, and are both larger
than the standard scale variation uncertainty.
This gives us some confidence that the
MaxDev uncertainty is reasonable at the NNLL′ level.

Resummed Predictions up to NNLL′ + NNLO
In section 5.1 we present our final results for the Drell-Yan process pp →Z/γ∗+ X →
l+l−+ X in the presence of the TB/Cj jet vetoes, at both NLL′+NLO and NNLL′+NNLO.
These are compared to the fixed order NLO and NNLO results to assess in what region
of T cut the resummation has an impact. In section 5.2 we study the impact of the π2
resummation (discussed in section 2) on both our NLL′+NLO and NNLL′+NNLO results.
We first summarise the setup used in our analysis: we use the MSHT20nloas120 PDFs
for the NLO and NLL′ + NLO predictions, and the MSHT20nnloas118 PDFs for the NNLO
and NNLL′ + NNLO predictions [60]. These predictions were implemented in Mathematica
[61] using a PDF interpolation package created and described in ref. [62]. The mass and
width of the Z boson were set to be MZ = 91.1876 GeV and ΓZ = 2.4952 GeV respectively.
We give predictions for the production of massless lepton pairs of a single species (e.g.
electron-positron pairs). We consider the centre-of-mass energy to be 13 TeV, integrate Q
