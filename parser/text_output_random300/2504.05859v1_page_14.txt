Figure 2. The hot-electron extraction and lattice temperature increase distinguished in 
transient reflectance spectra. (a) Contour plot of transient reflectance (TR) spectrum as 
a function of pump-probe delay 𝜏𝜏 with probe energy covering AW  and AW
− 
resonances of WS2. With 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷= 2.6 V and 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸=0 V, 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 in MoSe2 and Δ𝐶𝐶 are 
about 1.3 × 1012 cm-2 and 120 meV, respectively. The pump fluence of 63 𝜇𝜇J/cm2 
generates an initial exciton density 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 about 2.5 × 1012 cm-2, which is determined 
by multilayer interference calculation (see the SI). (b) Spectral linecuts at various 𝜏𝜏, 
extracted from (a). The curves are vertically displaced for clarity, with dashed lines 
denoting ΔR/R=0. (c, d) The two-profile analysis of the TR spectra at 𝜏𝜏=1.2 and 40.2 
ps. The upper panel shows the experimental data and fitting; the lower panel shows the 
two TR profiles used in the fitting, revealing 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 and ∆𝑇𝑇∗. (e, f) The dynamics of 
𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 and ∆𝑇𝑇∗, fitted with a two-exponential function (dashed).
