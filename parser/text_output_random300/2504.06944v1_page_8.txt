Figure 5. Crater cross section of a) 40-80 µm glass beads and b) LMS-1 without compaction;                                                       
Both craters were formed with similar ambient conditions and a constant mass flow rate of 215 slpm. 
3.3 Volumetric Erosion Rate and Bulk Density 
From gamma ray attenuation measurements, the observed ranges of bulk density 
during this study were 0.87-1.16 g/cm3 for LHS-1D, 1.34-1.86 g/cm3 for LHS-1, 1.60-2.03 g/cm3 
for LMS-1, and 1.56-1.62 g/cm3 for 40-80 µm glass beads. The volumetric erosion rate, 
calculated from linear fitting of time histories, is shown in Figure 6 as a function of bulk density 
and mass flow rate for LHS-1, LMS-1, LHS-1D, and 40-80 µm glass beads. The vertical error bars 
represent the 1- error calculated from repeat trials, while horizontal error bars have been 
omitted for clarity. Density has been measured with a resolution of 0.07 g/cm3 for each run. 
 
Figure 6. Volumetric erosion rates as a function of bulk density and mass flow rate. 
The average observed volumetric erosion rates ranged between 2.5-16.2 cm3/s for trials 
with a constant mass flow rate of 215 slpm, 1.0-6.2 cm3/s for trials with a constant mass flow 
rate 170 slpm, and 0.1-2.4 cm3/s for trials with a constant mass flow rate of 125 slpm. In Figure 
6, dashed lines have been added between data points to highlight the general pattern in the 
measurements with respect to mass flow rate. These lines are intended for illustrative purposes 
and do not represent any specific model or mathematical relationship between the variables. 
While volumetric erosion rate generally decreases with an increase in bulk density for all mass 
flow rates, the influence of bulk density on volumetric erosion rate was most pronounced for
