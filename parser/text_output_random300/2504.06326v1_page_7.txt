3. Application:Detection of characteristically near stable vector
fields
on motion waveforms in infrared video frames
. This section illustrates how to identify characteristically near motion waveforms
in stable or unstable vector fields recorded in sequences of infrared video frames.
This application presents an advance over the method of evaluating motion wave-
forms in video frames that was introduced in [17]. In the following example, the
vector fields emanate from seqiences of runner waveforms is recorded in frame se-
quences in infrared videos. Be comparing the stability characteristics of the runner
vector fields in pairs of video frames, we can then determine the overall stability
of the runner. This approach carries over in assessing the characteristic closeness
