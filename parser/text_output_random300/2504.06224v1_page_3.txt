where one has also to account for the fact that at large
radii r∗is not exactly equal to r and subleading terms
are relevant to catch the nonlinear tails.
The closed
form of GF is obtained in the Supplementary Material.
For instance, for ℓ= 2, it reads

For ℓ= 4, using the Green function given in the Sup-

Furthermore, by using the general form of the

Let us notice here that a similar result holds for the
Reissner-N¨ordstrom BH with metric of the form (1)
with f = 1 −2M/r + Q2/r2. In this case, using the
corresponding relation r∗(r) in the integral (10), we get

There is one more passage to perform though to arrive
at the ﬁnal result.
From the RW to the asymptotic ﬂat gauge – The
last necessary step we have to take in order to obtain
the correct power-law tail of the gravitational waveform
is to go to an asymptotic ﬂat (AF) gauge from the RW
gauge. This is because the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli for-
malism that we have employed is under the RW gauge
and this gauge is not asymptotically ﬂat. Following Ref.
[39], we can write the fundamental modes at inﬁnity in
the asymptotic ﬂat gauge at ﬁrst- and second-order for
the modes (2, ±2) and (4, ±4) as
h(1)AF

From this expression, we deduce that the leading power-
law tail for the gravitational waveform for the even
modes is
h(2)AF

ℓm ∼t−2ℓ−1.

This is our ﬁnal result for the nonlinear tail of the even
gravitational degrees of freedom.
Conclusions – It is well-established that, when a BH
reaches its static conﬁguration, linearized ﬂuctuations
at ﬁxed spatial positions decay over time according to
the Price’s power law. In this Letter, we have provided
an analytical explanation for the power-law tail that
governs the decay of nonlinear perturbations at sec-
ond order in perturbation theory. The exponent of this
power law is determined by the fact that the second-
order source decays as the inverse of the square of the
distance, which may result in a signiﬁcantly longer de-
cay time compared to the linear case. Speciﬁcally, the
quadratic even modes decay as ∼t−2ℓ−1, in contrast
to the linear Price’s scaling ∼t−2ℓ−3. In other words,
the linear perturbation theory might be inadequate for
predicting the late-time evolution of the ringdown, ne-
cessitating the inclusion of higher-order corrections.
Note Added
When ﬁnalizing this work, we became aware of Ref.
[71], which addresses the nonlinear tail of an interacting
scalar ﬁeld in a Schwarzschild spacetime. In contrast
to this reference, we have focused on the nonlinear tail
of the second-order gravitational degrees of freedom.
Nevertheless, where overlap occurs, our results are fully
consistent.
