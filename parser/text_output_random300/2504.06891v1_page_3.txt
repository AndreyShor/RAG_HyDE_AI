The Sun is the most studied of all stars, and thus constitutes a benchmark for stellar mod-
els. However, our vision of the Sun is still incomplete, as illustrated by the current debate
on its chemical composition. The problem reaches far beyond chemical abundances and
is intimately linked to microscopic and macroscopic physical ingredients of solar models
such as radiative opacity, for which experimental results have been recently measured that
still await theoretical explanations. We present opacity proﬁles derived from helioseismic
inferences and compare them with detailed theoretical computations of individual element
contributions using three different opacity computation codes, in a complementary way
to experimental results. We ﬁnd that our seismic opacity is about 10% higher than the-
oretical values used in current solar models around 2 million degrees, but lower by 35%
than some recent available theoretical values. Using the Sun as a laboratory of funda-
mental physics, we show that quantitative comparisons between various opacity tables
are required to understand the origin of the discrepancies between reported helioseismic,
theoretical and experimental opacity values.
