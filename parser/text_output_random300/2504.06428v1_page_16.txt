FIG. 10: Spinors based at b on the cusps of Oct(1).

1 = ⟨ξ23 ∧ξ25⟩⟨G23ξ35 ∧ξ24⟩
⟨ξ23 ∧G23ξ35⟩⟨ξ25 ∧ξ24⟩.

Using the identity for any three framing flags s1, s2, s3:
s1⟨s2 ∧s3⟩+ s2⟨s3 ∧s1⟩+ s3⟨s1 ∧s2⟩= 0 ,
(58)
one can immediately prove that the definitions (56)–(57b) satisfy the defining relation for L∆, i.e.
x1x′
1x′′
1 = −1 ,
x′′
1 + x−1

= 1 .
(59)
The same calculation follows for other ideal tetrahedra as long as the framing flags on the cusp boundaries are fixed.
See Appendix C. In total, 10 spinors need to be given, one associated to the cusp located on a link of Γ5. Keeping in
mind that the only base point of S3\Γ5 is b2, we use G2a to parallel transport the spinor ξab to b2 when the link eab
is not connected to node 2. For a, b ̸= 2, we choose the spinor ξab with a < b on Sa (instead of ξba on Sb). This fixes
all the spinors we use:
e12 : ξ21
e13 : G21ξ13 e14 : G21ξ14 e15 : G21ξ15
e23 : ξ23
e24 : ξ24
e25 : ξ25
e34 : G23ξ34 e35 : G23ξ35
e45 : G24ξ45

It is straightforward to check that
xiyiziwi = 1 ,
∀i = 1, · · · , 5 .
(61)
This allows us to eliminate wi and define
pzi = z′′
i −w′′
i ,
zi = xi, yi, zi ,
(62)
which is indeed the conjugate momenta of zi as symplectic coordinates of LOct(i) as the algebraic curve equation
pzi −xiyizi + z−1
i
= 0
(63)
is satisfied. We give the explicit formulas (C1) for all the FG coordinates on Oct(1) in Appendix C. The vectors
of coordinates ⃗ϕ := (xi, yi, zi)⊤
i=1,··· ,5 and ⃗π := (pxi, pyi, pzi)⊤
i=1,··· ,5 are the exponential coordinates of ⃗Φ and ⃗Π
respectively(r.f. (32)). They enter the “machine” of symplectic transformation and define the exponentiated FN
coordinates on annuli and the exponentiated FG coordinates on 4-holed spheres:

The parameters of ⃗Q and ⃗P then enters the spinfoam amplitude formula (43). The FN lengths {ℓ2
ab ≡qI} with
I = 1, · · · , 10 are those that satisfy the first-class simplicity constraints, i.e. ℓ2
ab = e−4πijab/k.
