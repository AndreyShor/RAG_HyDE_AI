RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.
Fitted results
We construct χ2
weight with weights shown in Table I, then determine the fitted values of the
model’s free parameters by minimizing χ2
weight with MINUIT. Due to the large number of fit
parameters and the sparsity of experimental data for some observables, the fitting process yields
a few different convergence results. We have selected the most representative set of results as our
final fitted results. The results of all 77 fit parameters are listed in Table II and Table III, and the
corresponding values of χ2 are listed in Table IV.
Table II and Table III present the specific values of 77 fit parameters and some other fixed
parameters in our theoretical model.
It should be noted that that during the fitting process,
we observed that the widths of N(1535)1/2−, N(1875)3/2−, N(2270)3/2−& 5/2−, ∆(1910)1/2+
and ∆(1940)3/2−tend to be larger; however, they have no significant impact on the fitted results.
Consequently, the widths of N(1535)1/2−, N(1875)3/2−, N(2270)3/2−& 5/2−are set at 450 MeV,
while the widths of ∆(1910)1/2+ and ∆(1940)3/2−are set at the upper limits of the width ranges
recorded in PDG. Apart from these parameters, the other fit parameters have convergent fitted
values with associated errors.
For the molecules, as calculated in Refs. [15, 18], the widths exhibit a significant dependence on
the cutoff parameters, and the range of widths for the molecules can cover the possible width range
of the general nucleon excited states. Thus, it is difficult for us to provide accurate predictions for
both the total width and the coupling constants of the molecules. The fitted values of them listed
in Table II are deemed consistent with the calculations in Refs. [15, 18] and regarded as reference.
For the general resonances in the s-channel, Table II lists the fitted values of their fit parameters
along with their basic information. Besides the coupling constants, some widths and masses are
treated as fit parameters, with fitted values basically falling within the range recorded in the PDG.
For K1(1270), only three products of coupling constants serve as independent free parameters, and
their fitted values are also presented in Table II.
Table III presents the fitted values of the free cutoff parameters, with the exchanged particles
listed below sharing the same cutoff value, as noted in Sec. III B.
Table IV clearly illustrates the fit quality of the final fitted results.
Here, χ2 presents an
unweighted chi-squared statistic, while Ndata and Npar. indicate the number of experimental data
points and free parameters, respectively. Nearly all the χ2/Ndata values of the observables in the
