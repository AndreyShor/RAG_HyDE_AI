For a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on an infinite interval, we exactly calculate the
variance of the integrated current for a step initial condition with average densities, ρa on the
negative axis and ρb on the positive axis. Our exact solution reveals that the presence of dephasing,
no matter how small, alters the nature of current fluctuations from ballistic to diffusive in the
long-time limit. The derivation relies on the Bethe ansatz on the infinite interval and a nontrivial
parameter dependence, referred to as the ω-dependence, of the moment generating function for the
integrated current. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the asymptotic form of the variance and
a numerically obtained cumulant generating function coincide with those in the symmetric simple
exclusion process.
Introduction.— Nonequilibrium fluctuations have been
central objects of study in classical statistical mechanics
for many years. Investigating them has provided deep
insights into the universal behavior of nonequilibrium
phenomena in classical systems, such as absorbing-state
phase transitions including the directed percolation uni-
versality class [1], and dynamical critical phenomena [2],
as well as interface growth phenomena described by the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class [3, 4].
Recently, nonequilibrium dynamics in isolated quan-
tum many-body systems has attracted significant atten-
tion, as exemplified by the development of generalized
hydrodynamics [5, 6] and studies of electron fluids [7, 8].
While these approaches focus primarily on average be-
havior, there has been growing theoretical interest in
nonequilibrium fluctuations as a means to explore univer-
sal dynamics [9–34]. This interest has been further fueled
by state-of-the-art experimental platforms, which now
make it possible to investigate fluctuations [35–41]. For
example, in an experiment using superconducting qubits,
KPZ-type behavior was observed in the lower moments of
currents, while non-KPZ-type behavior appeared in the
higher moments [39].
These efforts naturally motivate the study of how dis-
sipation affects the nature of nonequilibrium fluctuations
[42–48]. This is because dissipation is not only unavoid-
able in experiments, but is also known to dramatically
alter the properties of quantum systems. A well-known
example of such dissipation is dephasing noise, a simple
and fundamental form of particle-conserving dissipation
that is also experimentally feasible [49–51]. Dephasing
changes the long-time behavior of systems from ballis-
tic to diffusive, even when it is arbitrary weak. While
this has been demonstrated for an average current in a
few simple models [52–64], whether such a drastic change
also occurs for current fluctuations remains a fundamen-
tal and intriguing question [45, 46].
In this work, we theoretically study current fluctua-
tions in a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise start-
ing from a step initial condition with two densities (see
Fig. 1). We derive an exact expression for the variance
of an integrated current and show that the presence of
dephasing, no matter how small, changes the growth of
current fluctuations from ballistic to diffusive in the long-
time limit. Our derivation consists of two essential steps.
First we show that the moment generating function of an
integrated current exhibits a nontrivial parameter depen-
dence on the counting field and initial densities. Second
we prove the integral formula for the Green’s function by
employing the Bethe ansatz technique on an infinite in-
terval. Both techniques have been successfully applied to
the study of fluctuations in classical interacting systems
[65–68]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ex-
ample of their application to the study of fluctuations in
open quantum many-body systems. In addition to these
results, we demonstrate that both the asymptotic form of
the variance and a numerically obtained cumulant gener-
ating function of an integrated current agree with those
in the symmetric simple exclusion process (SEP) [66].
Setup.— We consider a tight-binding chain with de-
phasing noise on an infinite interval. Under the Markov
approximation, the time evolution of the density matrix
ρ(t) is governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarhan-
Lindblad (GKSL) equation [69–71],
dρ
dt = L[ρ] ∶= −i[H,ρ] + ∑
x∈Z
LxρL†
x −1
2{L†
xLx,ρ},
(1)
where L is referred to as the Liouvillian.
In Eq. (1),
the Hamiltonian is given by the one-dimensional tight-
binding model H ∶= −∑x∈Z(a†
xax+1 + a†
x+1ax) and the
Lindblad operator Lx ∶= √4γnx describes dephasing.
This Lindblad operator can be derived from continu-
ous weak measurements [71], incoherent light scattering
[72], or noisy on-site potentials [73]. Here, ax, a†
x, and
nx ∶= a†
xax are the annihilation, creation, and number op-
erators of fermions at site x, and γ represents the strength
of the dephasing. In this work, we consider a step initial
condition with two densities,
ρini ∶= ∏
x∈Z
[ρxnx + (1 −ρx)(1 −nx)],
(2)
where we define ρx ∶= ρa for x ≤0 and ρx ∶= ρb for x > 0.
