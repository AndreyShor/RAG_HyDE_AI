time. Two polar ABAC and ABCB stacking orders in tetralayer graphene are clearly 
identified through the gate-tunable nanoscale imaging technique. We also 
unambiguously demonstrate the DW sliding mechanism on switching one polar 
stacking to another with opposite out-of-plane polarization in graphitic multilayers. The 
attainable fusion of gate-tunable optical imaging at the nanoscale with spontaneous 
electric polarizations in 2D elemental carbon at room temperature expands the research 
of 2D ferroelectricity. Our study may open new and exciting opportunities in exploring 
new forms of 2D sliding ferroelectricity and developing high-performance multiferroic 
devices.  
 
Methods 
Scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) 
The SNOM measurements were performed under ambient condition. An infrared laser 
at ~ 10.6 µm was focused onto the apex of the gold-coated conductive AFM tip that 
was operated in a tapping mode (~ 200 kHz) during the sample scanning. The scattered 
signal by the oscillating tip was subsequently detected by a high-speed HgCdTe 
detector and demodulated at the third harmonic of the tip tapping frequency by a lock-
in amplifier to suppress the large back-reflected background. SNOM and topography 
images were simultaneously obtained.  
Raman spectroscopy 
Raman spectra were taken using a 532 nm laser focused by an objective (Nikon with 
NA = 0.60). The backscattered signal was collected by the same objective and filtered 
before being dispersed by a 1200/mm grating spectrometer and detected by a liquid-
N2-cooled silicon detector (Princeton Instruments). The typical laser power and 
exposure time used were ~ 1.1 mW and ~ 60 s. 
Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) 
KPFM measurements were conducted using a commercial scanning probe microscopy 
system (Dimension Icon, Bruker) under FM-KPFM mode. Tips with a mechanical 
resonance frequency of ~ 75 kHz and a force constant of ~ 3 N/m were used.   
Near-field optical contrast between polar domains 
To extract the optical contrast between, for example, the regions I and II (𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼−𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼) 𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
