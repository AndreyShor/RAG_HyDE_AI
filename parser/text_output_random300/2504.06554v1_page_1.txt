We experimentally demonstrate a qubit-efficient variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm using a
superconducting quantum processor, employing minimal quantum resources with only a transmon qubit cou-
pled to a high-coherence photonic qubit. By leveraging matrix product states to compress the quantum state
representation, we simulate an N +1-spin circular Ising model with a transverse field. Furthermore, we develop
an analog error mitigation approach through zero-noise extrapolation by introducing a precise noise injection
technique for the transmon qubit. As a validation, we apply our error-mitigated qubit-efficient VQE in deter-
mining the ground state energies of a 4-spin Ising model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of performing
quantum algorithms with minimal quantum resources while effectively mitigating the impact of noise, offering
a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theoretical advances and practical implementations on current
noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Quantum technology has seen rapid advancement, from
its theoretical beginnings [1, 2] to the development of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices [3]. These de-
vices, which leverage tens to hundreds of qubits, are ca-
pable of solving problems that challenge classical comput-
ers, marking an important step toward realizing quantum ad-
vantage [4, 5]. Despite these achievements, NISQ devices
face considerable limitations, including shallow circuit depths
and the inability to implement full quantum error correction,
which restrict the scope of quantum algorithms that can be
executed effectively [6, 7]. Among the algorithms designed
for these NISQ devices, the variational quantum eigensolver
(VQE) stands out due to its hybrid quantum-classical ap-
proach, which has proven effective in finding the ground state
energies of quantum systems [8–10]. The VQE has already
been used to compute molecular energies and solve quantum
many-body problems [11, 12], generating significant interest
in both research and industry [13, 14]. However, the practical
implementation of VQE on NISQ devices remains challeng-
ing due to the constraints imposed by high noise level and lim-
ited qubit resources. These challenges necessitate the devel-
opment of qubit-efficient strategies [15] and error mitigation
techniques [16–20] to improve the scalability and accuracy of
quantum simulations.
Qubit-efficient methods, such as those leveraging matrix
product states (MPS), tensor networks, and circuit-cutting
techniques, reduce the number of qubits required for simula-
tions while maintaining accuracy [21–27]. These approaches
enable the simulation of larger quantum systems on current
hardware by effectively managing qubit resources, making
them promising solutions for scaling quantum computations
within the constraints of NISQ devices. In particular, MPS
provides a compact and efficient representation of quantum
states, particularly for systems with limited entanglement. On
a quantum computer, MPS can be implemented using fewer
qubits than the physical degrees of freedom by sequentially
measuring and reusing qubits. This approach effectively in-
creases the bond dimension, allowing the representation of
more entanglement with fewer qubits [28, 29]. For example, it
has been shown that even a 1D cluster state of arbitrary length
can be represented using just two qubits [21]. Additionally,
error mitigation techniques, such as zero-noise extrapolation
and probabilistic error cancellation, play a crucial role in re-
ducing computational errors without the need for full error
correction [6, 17, 30]. These methods are particularly suited
for NISQ devices, where the overhead required for full quan-
tum error correction remains prohibitively high [3].
In this work, we experimentally implement a qubit-efficient
VQE algorithm using a superconducting quantum processor.
By leveraging MPS [21], we reduce the qubit requirements
for simulating an N +1-spin circular Ising model with a trans-
verse field. Specifically, we simulate a 4-spin system using
just two physical qubits, demonstrating the potential for scal-
ing quantum simulations with fewer resources.
To further
enhance the accuracy of our simulations, we employ analog
error mitigation using zero-noise extrapolation, which miti-
gates errors by extrapolating results from multiple noise lev-
els. This combination of qubit-efficient algorithms and error
mitigation allows us to push the boundaries of what is achiev-
able on current quantum hardware, highlighting the feasibility
of tackling larger quantum problems within the constraints of
existing technologies.
