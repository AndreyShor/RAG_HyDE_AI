data, with small uncertainties in the peak region. The contribution from ∆¯u and ∆¯d are almost
identical and opposite at all scales. The polarization of the other flavors is suppressed, both at
low- and high-Q scales and affected by larger uncertainties. The gluon contribution instead, is
positive in the large-x region and compatible with 0 in the small-x limit. Its magnitude has a
stronger dependency on the scale, with the DGLAP mixing pulling ∆g in the positive direction
at smaller x’s in favor of a depletion of the valence quark polarization for higher-Q.
We now turn to scrutinize the perturbative stability of our results, in terms of fit quality and
of parton distribution functions, and analyze the differences of our new determination with
respect to the previous NNPDF analysis. We then conclude examining the implications of our
fits on the total proton spin decomposition.
5.3.1. Dependence on theory and dataset variations
We begin the discussion looking at the fit quality. In Table 2.1 we report the number of data
points and the χ2 per data point in the LO, NLO and NNLO NNPDFPOL2.0 PDF determinations
before and after inclusion of MHOUs. Datasets are grouped according to the classification of
Section 5.1 and MHOUs are computed with the 7-point prescription described above. All the
fits display an overall good quality with the χ2 being closer to the unity. As observed in the
unpolarized case (cf. Section 4.3.1), fits which include MHOUs are more stable at different
perturbative orders. Here, we can notice that the largest difference in χ2 between fits with and
without theory uncertainties is indeed visible for the LO fits. While inclusive jet and dijet data
are equally described at all orders, the effect of QCD corrections is mainly noticeable in the DIS
data, especially when going from LO to NLO.
The remarkable stability of the polarized PDF fits at different QCD orders is also visible directly
on the PDFs, as shown in Fig. 5.6. There we display the gluon ∆g, the total singlet ∆Σ and total
valence ∆V at Q = 100 GeV for each perturbative order with the set including MHOUs. All the
flavor combinations are compatible at the one σ level, with the major differences visible only in
the size of the uncertainties bands, for specific kinematic regions. In particular, LO fits have
broader uncertainties in both in the gluon and the valence-like PDFs and have lower central
