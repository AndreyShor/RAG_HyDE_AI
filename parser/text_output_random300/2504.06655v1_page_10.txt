mixing signal as given by equation 8 and shown schematically in Fig 2)b) through density matrix 
descriptions.56,57 Fig 2)c) Shows the typical 2DES spectra for coupled oscillators, where on the 
left side there are corresponding linear spectra. Where practically ω1 is the pump frequency and ω3 
is the probe frequency and are obtained by effectively Fourier transform of t1 and t3 time delays. 
Fig. 2)d) is the wave vector for rephasing the pulse sequence. This clearly reflects that we can 
expect spatial shift for (nlooscillating) and (nlostatic) depending on the extent of phase mismatch 
(∆kz).

Here pertinent to mention that there are some standard assumptions and experimental tricks to 
handle the equations reasonably like the dipole approximations are valid, there is an ordering of 
the pulse sequence, the rotating wave approximations are taken into account and the pulses are 
considered to be ultra-fast so that can be assumed to be delta functions.56,57 Hence for different 
phase matching conditions, different response functions (Equation 9) can be obtained which gives 
the spectral details of the FWM signal.

Now the colloidal nano/micro particle systems can have surface-enhanced properties. In that 
case, the interfacial potential will contribute to the total nonlinear polarization. So we can consider 
the total nonlinear polarization as a sum of both from oscillating contribution and the static electric 
field contribution from the surface, similar to equation 2.
