From eqn. (4.15), it is clear that the solutions of the self-duality and background gauge
conditions (4.14) are the zero modes of T. Defining the inner products in the two spaces as
(W′, W) ≡
R
T4
W
′∗
µ Wµ and ((f′, g′), (f, g)) ≡
R
T4
(1

′∗
µνfµν + g
′∗g), the adjoint operator T † is:
T † : (fµν, g) →Wµ = −Dνfνµ −Dµg .
(4.16)
The operators T †T and TT † can also be worked out, as in [49, 50]. For use below, we note
that TT † is the second order differential operator acting on (fµν, g), which depends on ¯Aω
µ as
well as Sµ:
TT † : (fµν, g) →(f′
µν = −Dµ(Dλfλν −Dνg) + Dν(Dλfλµ −Dµg) + ϵµνησDη(Dλfλσ −Dσg),
g′ = −DµDνfνµ −DµDµg)
(4.17)
As usual the index is defined as dimker(T †T) −dimker(TT †) and, as per the index theorem,
depends only on the topological properties of the manifold on which the operators are defined
as well as on the topological properties (Chern classes) of the gauge background. For the
abelian gauge background in (4.14) only the second Chern classes (quantized fluxes through
various two-planes) are nonzero. We now will argue, first, that generally
dimker(T †T) −dimker(TT †) = 2r
(4.18)
and, second, that (at least for sufficiently small Sµ)
dimker(TT †) = 0.
(4.19)
To show this, as we now explain, the operator TT †, with Sµ = 0, was studied in [1], using
a different language, and was shown to have no normalizable zero modes. The important point
is that, for Sµ = 0 (recall that Sµ is, by definition, an x-dependent periodic background) the
operator T maps to the abelian Dirac operator, which we call ¯D, with a background U(1)
gauge field 2πNAω
µ, acting on two sets of undotted two-component Weyl spinors. These Weyl
spinors are equivalent to the four complex-dimensional space of Wµ through the quaternion
map Wµ →W = σµWµ already introduced in section 2. Further, as eqn. (2.18) there shows,
for S = 0, the self-duality equations for W are written as ¯DW = 0.
This quaternionic
equation is equivalent to two Dirac equations, with the Dirac operator acting on undotted29
two-component spinors λα:
T →two copies of ¯D : ¯Dλ = 0, or ¯D ˙ααλα = 0, with ¯D ≡¯σ ˙αα
ν Dµ
(4.20)
with Dµ from (4.13). The conjugate operator T † maps then to the conjugate Dirac operator
D, acting on dotted spinors ¯λ ˙α, as σµ
α ˙αD∗
µ¯λ ˙α, where D∗
µ = ∂µ −i2πNAω
µ, as already defined
after (4.11). The equation for zero modes of D then has the form
T † →two copies of D : D¯λ = 0, or Dα ˙α¯λ ˙α = 0, with D ≡σν α ˙αD∗
µ .
