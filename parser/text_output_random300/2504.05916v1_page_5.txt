are decoupled from each other [12]. The matrix representation of the Hamiltonian has

where the blocks
ˆHi, which only contain terms involving |gi⟩, |ei⟩, can be further
decomposed into sub-blocks of even and odd parity. In summary, this example is readily
understood in terms of the properties of the standard 2-level QRM. As illustrated in Fig.
1, there are 2 families of energy eigenvalues corresponding to doublets of type (index) 1
or 2, each of which can be further subdivided into sub-families with even or odd parity.
3.2. Non-Diagonal Couplings and the Radiation Basis
We now consider the case where the off-diagonal terms of the coupling matrix are non-
zero, such that for some b ∈(0, 1]
Λ = λ

In this situation, it is helpful to switch from the original bare basis to a radiation
basis [10,12]. The radiation basis is defined by using the singular value decomposition
(SVD) of the coupling matrix to define a new atomic basis, together with two effective
coupling constants. This allows us to view the model directly from the point of view of
the interaction with the field mode: The change of basis groups the collective atomic
modes that are either strongly or weakly coupled to the field. In particular, it reveals
how specific superpositions of atomic states (rather than the bare states themselves)
take part in the light-matter interaction.
The SVD is described in detail in Appendix A, the corresponding transformation
to the radiation basis is given by
|g1⟩= 1
√
2(|G1⟩+ |G2⟩), |g2⟩= 1
√
2(|G1⟩−|G2⟩),
|e1⟩= 1
√
2(|E1⟩+ |E2⟩), |e2⟩= 1
√
2(|E1⟩−|E2⟩),

and the eigenvalues of Λ are λ1 = λ(1 + b), λ2 = λ(1 −b). The interaction part of the
Hamiltonian reduces from 4 terms to 2,
ˆHint = λ1 (|G1⟩⟨E1| + |E1⟩⟨G1|) + λ2 (|G2⟩⟨E2| + |E2⟩⟨G2|) .

This is now structurally the same as the case described in the previous subsection [12,13]:
a direct sum of two independent 2-level Rabi models with effective couplings λ1(2), as
illustrated in the upper panel of Fig. 2. Note that the system retains a doublet symmetry
whereby the appropriate doublet operator (Eq. A.7 in Appendix A) commutes with the
Hamiltonian. Note that we adopt the convention that the lower the type index, the
higher the corresponding effective coupling.
