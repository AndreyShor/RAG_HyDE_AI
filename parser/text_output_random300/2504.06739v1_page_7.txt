ity χ as shown in Fig.6(c) where the inverse susceptibil-
ity χ−1 is plotted for the visibility. The susceptibility
increases very sharply approaching the zero temperature
limit due to the appearance of the Van Hove singularity.
This indicates a strong ferromagnetic instability which
could be triggered by a very small residual interaction
between the quasiparticles in realistic materials. So the
itinerant ferromagnetic order and other correlated eﬀect
are expected due to the appearance of the Van Hove sin-
gularity and the ﬂatness of this metallic band.

The three hybridization bands in the SKS phase are plotted

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS
In
summary,
unlike
the
twisting
in
the
bilayer
graphene, the sliding process in the present correlated
heterostructure does not change the unit cell but induces
rich multiorbital KS physics owing to the semimetallic
nature of the conduction electron bath and the inver-
sion symmetry breaking. This allows a general descrip-
tion for the real-space interlayer hybridization matrix el-
ements proportional to a single hybridization strength
V , usually chosen as the nearest-neighbor interlayer hy-
bridization parameter.
The hybridization matrix ele-
ments decrease substantially with distance and the ma-
jor elements can be reasonably approximated using the
cutoﬀscheme. The systematical evolution of the Kondo
phase can be mapped out by tuning the sliding distance
δx0 and the hybridization strength V .
Three phases,
i.e., the full-decoupled, the full-coupled, and the selec-
tively coupled phases, are distinguished by two critical
hybridization strengths Vc,A and Vc,B, corresponding to
the onsets of the KS for the local f electrons in the A-
or B-sublattice, respectively. The corresponding Kondo
scales, represented by the mean-ﬁeld parameters rA and
rB, are distinct due to the inversion symmetry breaking (

tributed from the respective bands at β = 400 (upper panel)
are well-separated. The DOS around the central peak is mul-
tiplied by a factor 1/10 for illustration. (b) A zoom-in look for
the DOS of the second band with temperatures ranging from
β = 400 to β = 10000 (middle panel). The peak position ( the
gray full circle) shifts towards to the zero frequency, and its
location ωpeak is plotted as a function of temperature in the
inset. (c) Temperature dependence of the inverse spin sus-

except for δx0 = 0, 3a0/2, where the inversion symmetry
is restored ). It turns out further that the main features
of these phases can be captured by the cases of δx0 = 0
and δx0 = a0, where the high symmetry C6 and low sym-
metry C3 are respected. In these two stack patterns, the
nearest-neighbor interlayer hybridization element V1 is
optimized, dominating over all other hybridization el-
ements, while the next-nearest-neighbor interlayer hy-
bridization element V2 can be treated as a major per-
turbation. Due to the Dirac metal nature of the host, a
critical hybridization strength (Vc > 0) is necessary for
