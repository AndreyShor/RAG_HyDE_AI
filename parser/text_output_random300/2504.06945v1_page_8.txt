FIG. 2. Dispersion relation of the zero-sound mode, showing the behaviour of the real and imaginary parts, ¯Ωr and ¯Ωi. In subfigures
(a) and (b), we have compared the numerical solutions of Eqs. (31) and (32) with the analytically-estimated power-law fittings,
depending on the energy scales, as discussed in the text. Subfigure (c) shows that the ratio of |Ωi| and |Ωr| (obtained from the
numerical solutions) falls off rapidly with increasing |¯q|.

Comparing Eq. (31) with Eq. (28), we find that the effect of not throwing away F I
0 is manifested in extra terms. Addi-
tionally, we have a nonzero imaginary part behaving as
¯Ωi =
[F R
0 (¯Ωr)]2
¯Ωr + F R
0 (¯Ωr) −F R
0 (¯Ωr) .

We can determine the asymptotic behaviour in two opposite limits as follows:
(1) For eΩr ≪1, the solutions are obtained as eΩr ≃(˜q/2)6/5 ⇒¯Ωr ≃Ω−1/5

. In
this regime, the applicable range of values of |¯q| are much less than Ω0. We have kept the subleading term (in terms of
powers of |¯q| for |¯q| ≪1) in eΩr’s expression because the coefficients are comparable and are essential to get a good fit
with the full numerical solutions.
(2) For eΩr ≫1, the solutions are obtained as ¯Ωr ≃|¯q| and ¯Ωi ≃−Ω1/3
0
|¯q|2/3 + Ω2/3
0
|¯q|1/3. In this regime, the applicable
range of values of |¯q| are much greater than Ω0. Again, we have kept the subleading term (this time, in terms of powers
of Ω0 for Ω0 ≪1) in eΩr’s expression in order to get a good fit with the full numerical solutions.
In Fig. 2, we show a comparison of the numerically-obtained solutions [of Eqs. (31) and (32)] with our analytical approxi-
mation of the power-law behaviour. Our solutions demonstrate the fact that the zero sound is indeed long-lived, because
the magnitude of imaginary part, ¯Ωi, is parametrically smaller than that of the real part, ¯Ωr. In fact, |Ωi/Ωr| falls off
swiftly with |¯q|, as illustrated in Fig. 2(c). All these observations then uphold our conclusions of Ref. [36], where we had
ignored F I and, hence, any measure of decay of the collective mode. We would like to emphasize that, there too, the
dispersion relation was found to behave as ∼|¯q|6/5 and ∼|¯q|, in the regimes below and above a characteristic crossover
scale, respectively.
For generic values of ℓ, when F I is ignored [36], we end up with two distinctly different types of excitations, appearing
in two avatars: particle-hole like localized modes forming an energy band (or continuum) and delocalized collective modes
with discrete energy-levels. However, on incorporating the F I-part correctly, we find here that such a clear-cut distinction
is lost. This is because, s is now complex-valued and, for any generic value, the integral in Eq. (27) will not vanish.
Therefore, the excitations now have mixed characters.
B.
Bosons away from the equilibrium
In this subsection, we remove the assumption that the bosons are in equilibrium. We allow both the fermionic and
the bosonic to be slight away from the equilibrium condition, with fluctuating nonequilibrium distribution functions, and
study the corrections coming from it to the Fermi-surface’s deformation modes.
Following the same approach as with the fermions [cf. Appendix C], the bosonic part of the QBEs is captured by
