From (15) one may obtain the statistical error for all quantities defined in terms of the IR, in
the usual way. With N = 100 we find that the error on the observables computed below, which
are sums over representations, is less than a few per cent. Some individual IR have larger errors
but are subdominant in the final results.
With the numerical expression (14) at hand, we obtain the partition function and Casimir as
Z =

These sums are over partitions, the number of which grows rapidly with N. We have been able
to perform the sums exactly, using a laptop, for N = 40. It is likely possible to get to much
higher N by statistically sampling from the partitions, but this has not proved necessary for our
purposes. Our results for the quantities (16) are shown in Figs. 2 and 3.
Fig. 2 shows log Z as a function of Ω.
The dashed lines show the asymptotic behaviour
at large and small Ω(and large N).
In these limits the partition function is dominated by
the maximally irreducible or the maximally reducible ‘trivial’ representation, respectively. The
partition function is seen to exhibit a kink at a value of Ωconsistent with the estimate (7) for
the crossover of dominance between these two saddles. On the large Ωside, the asymptotic
behaviour is followed down to the transition. This indicates the continued dominance of a single
representation. On the small Ωside, however, there is a deviation from the asymptotic behaviour.
We will see in detail in §3 and §4 below that this is due to a spread in representations contributing.

points are generated using (16) and N = 100, with the values of N shown in the legend. Dashed
lines show the large N expressions (4) and (5) for the large and small Ωasymptotics, respectively.
