The derivation of K groups by the Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence
The reduced K-groups eK(Mα) provide the stable classification of topological insulators over the ten Brillouin
platycosms. Each K-group K(Mα) can be analyzed through the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence. For each Mα,
consider a spectral sequence {Ep,q
r (Mα), dr}r≥1 with the first page given by
Ep,q
1 (Mα) ∼= Cp(Mα, Kq(pt)),
(S4)
where Cp(Mα, Kq(pt)) denotes the p-cochains with coefficients in Kq(pt), and the differential d1 is the standard
coboundary operator. The second page is given by
Ep,q
2 (Mα) ∼= Hp(Mα, Kq(pt)),
(S5)
which represents the p-th cohomology of Mα with coefficients in Kq(pt). The K-groups of a single point Kq(pt)
satisfy
Kq(pt) ∼=
(
Z,
if q is even,
0,
if q is odd.
(S6)
We adopt the notation K(Mα) ∼= K0(Mα). The spectral sequence evolves according to the differential
Ep,q
r+1 = ker dr : Ep,q
r
→Ep+r,q−r+1
r
im dr : Ep−r,q+r−1
r
→Ep,q
r
,
(S7)
where dr : Ep,q
r
→Ep+r,q−r+1
r
vanishes for even r, as Ep,q
r
∼= 0 for all odd values of q. Therefore, there are no updates
from E2 to E3, i.e., Ep,q

∼= Ep,q

for all p and q.
The E2 and E3 pages are depicted in Fig. S1, where the horizontal axis corresponds to p and the vertical axis to
q. Pages with p ≥4 or p ≤−1 are omitted, as all elements in these pages are zero. Note that the E2 and E3 pages
exhibit a periodicity in q with period 2.

FIG. S1: E2 and E3 pages of Mα, α = 0, . . . , 9. The horizontal axis corresponds to p and the vertical axis to q. The red dashed
line represents filtration of K0(Mα) and the blue dashed line represents filtration of K1(Mα).
When updating from the E3 to the E4 page, it is sufficient to consider the following chain complex:
0 →H0(Mα, Z) →H3(Mα, Z) →0,
(S8)
which is indicated by the arrow in Fig. S1. We need to treat the cases of orientable and non-orientable platycosms
separately. The zero cohomology group H0(Mα, Z) is isomorphic to Z for all platycosms. The third cohomology
group H3(Mα, Z) is isomorphic to Z if Mα is orientable, and is isomorphic to Z2 if Mα is non-orientable. Since
platycosms are 3-manifolds, the spectral sequence stabilizes at the fourth page.
For orientable Mα with α = 0, 5, . . . , 9, the chain complex in Eq. (S8) takes the form:
0 →Z
d−→Z →0.
