[17] The pairwise e3dtf interaction νe3dtf(r, L), defined in Eq. (5)
and employed frequently in previous work (e.g. Eq.(5) of
Ref.[14], Eq.(2) of Ref.[15], and Eq.(6) of Ref.[16]) differs
from the pairwise Ewald potential ν1(r, L)+ν2(r, L) proposed
in Eqs.(2) and (3) of Ref.[12] by Demyanov et al.. A key dis-
tinction is that νe3dtf(r, L), even in its computable form (e.g.
Eq.(3) of Ref.[14]), is independent of auxiliary parameters such
as δ or α, rendering it more physically meaningful.

[37] Eqs.(15) and (16) of Ref.[16] predict the asymptotic behavior
of the charge structure factor for conducting ionic fluids and in-

for the system interacting via the angular-averaged potential,
where ˆν(k|l, α) = ˆwaa(k)/(4πε0), remains to be confirmed
by numerical simulations.
