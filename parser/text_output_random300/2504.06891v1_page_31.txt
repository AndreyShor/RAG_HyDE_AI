Supplementary Figure 6: Effects of abundances on the seismic proﬁles. Purple curves are
related to Model 10 using MB22 abundances, red and orange curves to Model 7, a standard
solar model using GN93. Reference opacity proﬁles are indicated by dashed lines, while plain
lines indicate the seismic opacity proﬁles.
