The band gap energy (Eg) of a semiconductor is one
of the critical parameters in determining the efficiency of
solar cells. The Shockley-Queiser (SQ) limit prescribes
that the theoretical maximum efficiency (approximately
33.7 %) of single-junction cells is achieved at an op-
timum band gap of approximately 1.34 eV29.
This is
an optimum between efficient photon absorption across
the solar spectrum and minimized thermalization losses.
Practically, cost-efficient and stable materials such as
crystalline silicon (Eg ∼1.1 eV) dominate the market
despite offering practical efficiencies of around 27.3%,
lower than the SQ limit30.
High-efficiency III-V semi-
conductors such as GaAs (Eg ∼1.43 eV) record effi-
ciencies near 30% under concentrated illumination; how-
ever, their high cost limits widespread adoption31. New
materials, like perovskites, such as FAPbI3, offer band
gaps around 1.5 eV and have demonstrated high power
conversion efficiencies (up to 25.8%) with excellent sta-
bility, making them promising candidates for integration
into tandem solar cell architectures that aim to surpass
the single junction efficiency limit 32. Multijunction so-
lar cells utilizing stacks of semiconductors with progres-

sively lower band gaps (such as InGaP/GaAs/Ge)have
demonstrated record laboratory efficiencies approaching
47% under concentrated illumination, thanks to their op-
timized spectral utilization across the solar spectrum4,30.
However, deviations from the ideal band gap create
trade-offs: smaller band gaps (less than 1.1 eV) enhance
thermal losses, whereas larger band gaps (greater than
1.7 eV) decrease photocurrent generation33. Thus, the
ideal range of band gaps for efficient solar cells is deemed
to be around 1.1–1.7 eV, successfully compromising be-
tween theoretical ideals and practical limitations.
The calculated band gap of 1.37 eV in this work for
SbH4PbI3 signifies that SbH4PbI3 could be a more ef-
fective perovskite material than MAPbI3 for band gap
utility in solar cells. However, it is acknowledged that
