Under this assumption, we can prove the following
Lemma 2.3. Let Sn = ϕ(ˆYn), n = 1, . . . , N + 1 be defined as in Assumption
2.2 and assume BC(Yn, ˆYn) ∼N(Sn, 1) for all n = 1, . . . , N +1 with Sn = s1
for n = 1, . . . , ¯n, Sn = s2 > s1 for n = ¯n + 1, . . . , N, and SN+1 = s3 > s2
Then, if |s3 −s1| <
1
40, and
|s3 −s1| >
N −n
N −¯n + 1|s2 −s1|
(18)
the validity gap defined in (10) is reduced by discarding the first ¯n samples.
Proof of Lemma 2.3 Let An = BC(Yn, ˆYn), n = 1, . . . N + 1. Under the
Lemma assumptions, the validity gap of Barber et al. (2023) becomes
gap =
PN
n=1 wndTV (An, AN+1)
1 + PN
n=1 wn
= γ

¯n|s1 −s3| + (N −¯n)|s2 −s3|
N + 1
(19)
where γ = 1
5 as shown in Devroye et al. (2018). The claim is obtained by requiring
¯n
N + 1|s1 −s3| +
¯n
N + 1|s2 −s3| <
N −¯n
N −¯n + 1|s1 −s2|
(20)
□
In the experiments, we let Sn = s(Zn) be the number of qubits in the n-th
circuit, n = 1, . . . , N + 1 and assume the total variation distance between
the corresponding BCs grows linearly in |Sn −Sn′|. In this case, the validity
gap can be reduced if
PN
n=1 |Sn −SN+1|
1 + N
> min
smin∈R
PN
n=1 1(Sn > smin)|Sn −SN+1|
1 + PN
n=1 1(Sn > smin)
(21)
While searching for smin ∈R requires trying N + 1 values and is always
feasible, smin is not guaranteed to fulfil (21) if the range of available circuit
sizes is limited, however.
In our experiments, we let smin be the second
largest circuit size in the calibration set.
Calibration samples associated
with smaller sizes are discarded or used to fit the shift model described in
the next paragraph.
