2 Bean model and pinning mechanisms
In this section, we provide a concise overview of the Bean model for extracting Jc
and summarize the ﬂux pinning mechanisms. Numerous studies cited in this review
frequently reference the Bean model and the analysis of pinning mechanisms.
The Bean model predicts the response of a superconductor with Jc to variations
in the external magnetic ﬁeld under isothermal conditions and explains the magnetic
hysteresis loop[63]. This model assumes that ﬂux motion within a sample induces a
local current density of Jc. When the external magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the sample
surface, the magnetic ﬁeld within the sample decreases linearly with distance from the
surface, as dictated by Amp`ere’s law. Consequently, Jc is expressed as follows:
Jc =
20∆M
a (1 −a/3b)
(1)
where ∆M represents the vertical width of the magnetic hysteresis loop, and a and b
(a<b) denote the sample dimensions perpendicular to the external ﬁeld. Thus, a larger
hysteresis loop area corresponds to a higher Jc.
To elucidate the pinning mechanism, the ﬁrst step involves calculating the mag-
netic ﬁeld dependence of the ﬂux pinning force density, deﬁned as Fp =
µ0 ⃗H × ⃗Jc
,
where µ0 is the vacuum permeability, and H is the external magnetic ﬁeld. Next, the
normalized ﬂux pinning force density, fp (= Fp/Fp,max), is computed as a function of
the reduced ﬁeld h (= H/H∗) at various temperatures. Here, Fp,max denotes the max-
imum value of Fp, and H∗represents the irreversible ﬁeld. The functional form of fp
depends on the speciﬁc pinning model. The Dew-Hughes model[64] provides a general
expression for fp as ∝hp(1 −h)q, where p and q are determined by the nature of the
ﬂux pinning in the superconductor. Representative pinning mechanisms discussed in
this review are as follows:
• normal surface pinning: fp ∝h0.5(1 −h)2
• normal point pinning: fp ∝h(1 −h)2
• ∆κ pinning: fp ∝h2(1 −h)
In the normal surface pinning and normal point pinning models, grain bound-
aries and precipitates serve as pinning centers, respectively. If spatial variations in
the Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ arise due to compositional ﬂuctuations in the
superconductor, these lead to ﬂux pinning described by the ∆κ pinning model. The
functional form of fp is often scaled with h′ = H/Hp instead of h. Here, Hp repre-
sents the magnetic ﬁeld corresponding to Fp,max. In this context, the scaling functions
are typically modiﬁed[65–67] as follows: fp = 25/16h′0.5(1 −h′/5)2 for normal surface
pinning, fp = 9/4h′(1 −h′/3)2 for normal point pinning, and fp = 3h′2(1 −2h′/3)
for ∆κ pinning. These formulations are frequently applied to HEA superconduc-
tors. To model the magnetic ﬁeld performance of Jc in two-gap superconductors,
the double exponential model is employed[68]. In this model, Jc(h) is described by
J1 exp(−A1h) + J2 exp(−A2h) where A1 and A2 are proportionality constants, and
J1 and J2 are the critical current densities corresponding to the large and small gaps,
respectively.
