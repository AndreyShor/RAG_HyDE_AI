anti-commutes with L2,1 (see around (III.8)),
L1,m ◦D±(ϕ2,1) = D∓(ϕ2,1) ◦L1,m ,
L2,1 ◦D±(ϕ1,2) = D∓(ϕ1,2) ◦L2,1 .

The m = 4 case also agrees with Table I as expected. Similarly for m odd, the answers are

L2,1 ◦D±(ϕ2,1) = D∓(ϕ2,1) ◦L2,1 ,

Pinning flows in 3-state Potts model
Pinning flows in non-diagonal Virasoro minimal models can be deduced from those in the diagonal theories by generalized
gauging (orbifold) of non-invertible symmetries (see [104] for a review). In particular, the IR factorization property obviously
persists if the symmetry being gauged commutes with the pinning flow.
Here we give one simple example of the pinning flow in the 3-state Potts model with O = ϕ2,1 of dimension ∆= 4
5. The
Potts model is related to the M5,6 minimal model by gauging the Z2 symmetry generated by the topological defect L1,3. While
ϕ2,2, ϕ1,2 are Z2 odd, ϕ2,1 is Z2 even and thus the corresponding pinning defect D±(ϕ2,1) survives the orbifold. Nonetheless,
the reshuffling of the bulk operator spectrum under the orbifold changes the boundary states [105, 106], and the symmetries
[78, 107] and in turn, the IR behavior of D±(ϕ2,1)Potts. The eight conformal boundaries organize into a multiplet with respect
to the bulk symmetries generated by the Z3 topological defect ω satisfying ω3 = 1, the Fib topological defect W, and the Z3
Tambara-Yamagami duality defect N satisfying N 2 = 1 ⊕ω ⊕ω2 and ωN = Nω = N,

(A.12)
There is also a charge conjugation symmetry C which extends the Z3 to an S3 symmetry and permutes the boundaries. In the
first equation above we give the explicit expression for the identity brane in the Potts model from those in M(5, 6). As before,
the g functions of the general boundaries follow from topological fusion and the quantum dimensions of the topological defects.
The symmetry subcategory that commutes with ϕ2,1 in the Potts model is VecS3. The bulk RG flow is integrable and for the
positive deformation, the IR phase is trivially gapped and for the negative deformation, there are three degenerate ground states
[101, 108]. Following the general discussion in Section III and Section IV A, the factorization channels of the pinning defect in
the IR is fixed to be the following,
D+(ϕ2,1) = |N⟩⟨N| ,
D+(ϕ2,1) =
2
M
n=0
|ωn⟩⟨ωn| ,
(A.13)
which are obviously related by ND±(ϕ2,1) = D∓(ϕ2,1)N (and have the same g-function) since the operator ϕ2,1 anti-commutes
with the defect N [78] (also see around (III.7)). One can also check that (A.13) follows from (A.10) directly by the orbifold
procedure [109].

Pinning flows from nontrivial topological defects
In the main text, we have briefly mentioned the generalization of our pinning flows to cases where the UV defect is a nontrivial
topological defect LUV and the operator O is a general operator on LUV (thus in general in a twisted sector when LUV is non-
invertible). Here we consider a few examples in the Ising CFT. Recall that the nontrivial topological defects here are the Z2
generator η and the duality defect N (not to be confused with the Z3 duality defect in the previous section).
For simple LUV, the only interesting possibility is N with primary operators in the Z2 twisted sector (since η is the only
nontrivial fusion channel of N with itself),
