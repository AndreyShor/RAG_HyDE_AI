Proof. First, rewrite Eq. (38) as:
E
h
ei(θ−α)ψ
i
= 1 + ei(θ−α)
2
ψ
(42)
As a sanity check, α is covariant under translations in θ (i.e., if we send θ →θ + β then α →α + β). This equation
implies that 1+ei(θ−α)
2
ψ is a constant, i.e.,
1 + ei(θk−α)
2
ψk = C
∀k ∈Ω
(43)
where C is some constant. But then
C = E
h
ei(θ−α)ψ
i
= E
h
1 + ei(θ−α)
ψ
i
−E [ψ]
= 2C −E [ψ]
(44)
so C = E [ψ]. The equation becomes:
E [ψ] = 1 + ei(θ−α)
2
ψ
(45)
By the same strategy one can also show that the above equation implies backwards to Eq. (43). So they are equivalent.

We now assume α is such that there is no k ∈Ωsuch that ei(θk−α) = −1. When this is not true (i.e., ∃k ∈
Ωei(θk−α) = −1), the case can be found in Appendix B because it is not relevant to later discussions in this paper.
With this assumption we derive
ψ =
E [ψ]
1+ei(θ−α)

= E [ψ]

1 −i tan θ −α

where we used the fact that

=
e−i θ−α

e−i θ−α

+ei θ−α

We have now found the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue eiα. Note that E [ψ] is effectively a overall constant,
which can be set such that the state |ψ⟩is normalized. We find
⟨ψ|ψ⟩= E [ψ]2

Ignoring phases we can pick E [ψ] =
1
√
E[ψ], which gives

This proves the first half of the theorem. As mentioned, proof to the second half is not important but can be found
in Appendix B.
A natural result is that if we were to do phase estimation with input state |1⟩, the probability of outcome α is
1
1+E[tan2 θ−α
2 ], as formally stated in the following remark.
6 We can also take the expectation on top of Eq. (43) and also get E
