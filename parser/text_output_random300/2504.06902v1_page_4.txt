TABLE I: Bases mismatch: XXY and YYX bases choices of the users A, B1 and B2. For each possible encoding on a
bases triplet, the amplitudes of the coherent states reaching the detectors are listed (rounded to the second decimal digit).
We attribute two different types of detection: Type 0 when the matching pair of users encodes the same bit value (phase)
and 1 when the users send encoded pulses with phase difference of π. In the latter case, one of the user needs to flip
her/his registered bit value to create a common bit in the shared key. The symbol ∧∧on the same row signifies
simultaneous clicks on detectors (D1 and D2).

TABLE II: Bases match: XXX bases choices for the users. For each possible users’ input we list the amplitudes of the
coherent states reaching the detectors and identify admissible types of detection. The results are identical for the

2. The signal pulses propagate through the fibers and
arrive simultaneously at the MU, where they pass
through the IU and are measured by the detectors
(see Fig. 2). The measurement outcome is consid-
ered successful if: a) one detector fires, or b) two
detectors fire simultaneously (see Table III). If the
outcome is successful, the detection type is also an-
nounced. If the measurement is unsuccessful, the
users discard their data and restart from Step 1.
3. Each user announces the basis used for encoding.
If the triplet of bases does not match the detec-
tion type in Table III, they discard their data and
restart the process. If the bases match, the pair(s)
with the matching bases generate a bit for their
shared key by following the actions outlined in Ta-
bles I-II, IV-V.
The users repeat the steps of the protocol until they
generate pairwise keys of sufficient length for their needs.
