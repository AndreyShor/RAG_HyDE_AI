Considerations on scaling laws and autocorrelation as an EWS
In the previous subsections, the scaling laws of the time-asymptotic variance along various modes are considered for p →0−and
κ →0+. In such limits, the EWS are shown to display different behaviours depending on the assumption of the spectrum of the
linear drift operator in the SPDE that defines u. As a concrete example, if the boundary noise does not perturb the solution along
the critical mode, the system may not exhibit CSD. The correlation of u and ξj for j ∈{0, 1} and, in the case of boundary noise, the
degeneracy of the stochastic component imply that the effect of the stochastic perturbation on ξj on u is not trivial. Fortunately,
the simple form of the linear operator B0(p) in (3.1), (3.5) and (3.7) enables the study of the problem along its eigenmodes.
We consider first the limit p →0−. In (2.2), the spectrum of A0(p) is discrete for any p ≤0 and the EWS displays hyperbolic
rate of divergence along the sensible eigenfunction e(p)
1
∗of its adjoint in Theorem 3.1. Furthermore, the EWS along the sensible
generalized eigenfunctions e(p)
1,k
∗of A0(p)∗indicate a faster scaling law depending on their rank k. Through the biorthogonality
of the generalized eigenfunctions of A0(p) and A0(p)∗we know that the the projection of g ∈H1 on e(p)
1,k
∗is equivalent to the
coefficient of g on the e(p)
1,M1−k+1, for any k ∈{1, . . . , M1}. This is intended in the sense that for M ∈N>0 and

for any i ∈{1, . . . , M}, k ∈{1, . . . , Mi} and p ≤0. As a result, the time-asymptotic covariance along e(p)
1,k1
∗and e(p)
1,k2
∗refers to
the time-asymptotic covariance of the oscillations of the coefficients of ud, the solution of (2.2), along e(p)
1,M1−k1+1 and e(p)
1,M1−k2+1.
This observable collects also the oscillations along e(p)
1,j1 and e(p)
1,j2 for j1 ∈{M1 −k1 + 2, . . . , M1} and j2 ∈{M1 −k2 + 2, . . . , M1}.
This is implied by the fact that oscillations along e(p)
1,k imply further perturbations along the mode e(p)
1,k−1 for any k ∈{2, . . . , M1},
as shown in (2.3).
The limit in (2.4) is different in nature from the previous case. The absence of eigenfunctions entails that there are no preferred
directions along which the EWS captures the bifurcation. As shown in Corollary 3.4, the shape of the spectrum can dampen the
EWS and hinder the scaling law of the time-asymptotic variance. Furthermore, for a non-differentiable f, the EWS is silenced or
assumes a logarithmic rate of divergence. In applications, the first case corresponds to the crossing of the bifurcation threshold
being unnoticed by the EWS.
The system (2.5) displays a similar scaling law to (2.2). Nonetheless, the noise perturbation is filtered by (A0 −q)D(p), an operator
often unknown in applications. As such, its dependence on p can affect the scaling law of the EWS and hinder the divergence
of the observable. Conversely, the operator D(p) is known for simple models [6, 19] and may not be dependent on p. A related
example is described in the section to follow.
The limit κ →0+ implies the (at most) hyperbolic divergence of the EWS in (2.2), (2.4) and (2.5). Such a behaviour is entailed
by the structure of B0(p) in (3.1), (3.5) and (3.7), respectively. While in the limit p →0−, at most only one eigenvalue tends to
the imaginary axis, in this case, an infinite number of real eigenvalues tend simultaneously to 0−along an equivalent number of
eigenfunctions. The assumptions of Q1, or Λ(p) in the case of (2.5), imply that the corresponding scaling law is captured along a
large set of modes in H1.
The resemblance of the scaling laws in the limit p →0−of the time-asymptotic variance of the models (2.2), (2.4) and (2.5)
compared to the corresponding deterministic models perturbed by white noise [6, 7] indicates that it should be possible to also
consider other observables, in analogy to the situation for finite-dimensional dynamics with white noise. Under the assumption of
discrete spectrum, a natural example is the time-asymptotic autocorrelation, which is known to behave as an exponential function
if studied along eigenmodes. We consider the case of (2.2). Then, we construct the time-asymptotic autocovariance with lag time
