both the value function ϱ (estimated by RL) and the A
population ρA, as a function of σA, for various λA, ϕE.
Survival of the weakest corresponds to ϱ, ρA decreasing
with σA. However, if σA falls too low then species B be-
comes very numerous and species C is suppressed, lead-
ing to ecosystem collapse and ϱ = −1.
We note that
the inclusion of hunger and natural death in the model is
necessary for ecosystem collapse and extinction. Without
these effects σA = 0 is typically the optimal parameter
value [6, 10, 36, 53, 81].

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF
ADVANTAGEOUS STRATEGIES
This Section describes in more detail the model be-
haviour, including the competition between species’ pop-
ulations and the role of hunger levels and spontaneous
death processes. We focus on pω = 0.015 (sparse case),
the behaviour for the crowded case is provided in Ap-
pendix A, for comparison.

A.
Survival of the Weakest (non-directional
movement)
To complement the results of RL, Fig. 10 illustrates
the behaviour of the system with non-directional move-
ment strategy, with parameter scans for λA, σA. We take
L = 300, consistent with Sec. III. Fig. 10(a) shows the
A population density ρA, showing extinction for small
λA, σA (leading to ρA = 0); there is a stable ecosystem
for larger λA, σA, with ρA decreasing with σ due to sur-
vival of the weakest (recall Fig. 9). Fig. 10(b) shows that
the C population ρC is anti-correlated with ρA. How-
ever, as discussed in Sec. V B, this effect cannot continue
to arbitrarily small σA because species C tends to die
out, and the ecosystem collapses.
To see this more clearly we identify three represen-
tative state points which have λA = 1.0 and σA =
0.0, 0.5, 1.0.
Figs. 10(c,d,e) show snapshots from these
state points:
the C-population is small in (d) which
favours species A. Figs. 10(f,g,h) show the time series
of the species densities. The oscillations are characteris-
tic of cyclic dominance (and for predator-prey dynamics
more generally). For case (g) the oscillations in C popu-
lation are significant but the population remains always
away from extinction. For case (h) where σA = 0 there
is no predation on the B species so its population grows
quickly, and this results in extinction.
Note that σA = 1.0 is the symmetric case where all
species behave identically.
Table IV shows a compar-
ison of this case with the non-symmetric state point
σA = 0.5. Specifically, the Table decomposes the steady-
state populations according to their hunger level. The
non-symmetric case has the higher A population, but this
increase is mostly among the particles with the highest
hunger level (A′′). These particles have a reduced repro-
duction rate so they contribute little to the propagation
of the species: the low value of σA means that they do
not consume too much prey (B), so the B population re-
mains large, which reduces in turn the density of preda-
tors C. This is how survival of the weakest operates in
this model, notwithstanding the differences from previ-
ous work (that too small a value for σA leads to the death
of the C species and hence extinction of all species).
