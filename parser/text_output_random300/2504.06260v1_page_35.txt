Multi-Turn Agent Prompts
The following prompt is used in the ToolLookupAgent to call tools. tool snippet is popu-
lated with the descriptions of each tool. state info is the execution and verifier feedback
for the solution to iterate upon (left panel of Figure 3).
Tool Selection
You are a COMSOL engineer. You are attempting to gather information relevant to
execution feedback that you received from the COMSOL client after you executed
some code. The relevant information can be queried as ‘ToolCall‘. Each ‘ToolCall‘
must consist of str along with the relevant arguments, if any. A ToolCall may or may
not require arguments. Identify the relevant tool calls and return your reply as a
‘ToolCalls‘ object, which consists of a list of ‘ToolCall‘s.
===
Here is some information on each tool
{{tool snippet}}
===
Now return the relevant ToolCallList for the following execution feedback / error
message.
FEEDBACK: {{ state info }}
Correction Prompt
You are an engineer solving the following PROBLEM in COMSOL, by generating a
solution that consists of the JAVA COMSOL API code needed to solve the problem.
You have so far generated the code in CODE. On executing the lines in CODE you
encountered the issue described in CURRENT EXECUTION FEEDBACK. CURRENT
EXECUTION FEEDBACK is formatted as ‘Line →Status: Error (if Status=‘Error‘)‘
where Status is ‘Correct‘ if the line of code was able to execute and ‘Error‘ if it raised
an error. You have additionally been provided with EXECUTION HISTORY which
is a record of some of your previous code solutions and their execution results. You
may use it as relevant context to understand what blocks of code work and what
you’ve already tried.
You must return a BETTER solution by correcting lines of code that raised errors, or
substituting blocks of code with other equivalent code snippets that would solve the
problem. The solution must be a full contiguous block of CODE. Use the example
provided below to understand how to format your CODE.
