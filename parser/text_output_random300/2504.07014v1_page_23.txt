As an additional consistency check we look at the density correlation function near the
critical point (kF →0, ξI →∞). As follows from the above formulas the behavior of the

Free Dirac fermions
Using methods of the finite-temperature quantum field theory [69], the partition function
of the gas of relativistic Dirac fermions can be expressed as a determinant of the inverse
Green’s function operators
ˆG−1(k, ωn) = ˆγ0(iωn + µ) + ˆγk −m ,
(B35)
which include in addition to the momentum-(Matsubara) frequency space, the Dirac ˆγ-
matrices. The condition for zeros of the partition function amounts to

k2 + m2 is the spectrum of the Dirac fermions. We consider µ ≥0 which
accounts over the surplus ¯n of fermions (

k2 + m2) over antifermions (−

k2 + m2). The
negative band is filled at µ ≥0. For simplicity we will present the results per one fermionic
flavor (spin). The critical properties of fermions with the Dirac spectrum are relevant not
only for relativistic electron gas per se, but also in the context of condensed matter physics
[19, 70].
For the Dirac fermions µ(T = 0) = εF =

The system is gapless with the linear excitation spectrum E(k) ≈|k −kF|kF/εF near the
FS. The characteristic energy scale (depth of the Fermi sea) εF −ε(0) = µ −m implies
zν′ = 1 →z = 2. At the QCP µ = m the spectrum is E(k) = k2/2m + O(k4), also in
agreement with z = 2. The order parameter P and ¯n are given by the formulas (B9,B10)
