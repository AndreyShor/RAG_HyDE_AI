DETAILS OF THE NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION
Numerical approaches to solving the Kadanoff–Baym equations are covered in great detail in, e.g., [93, 94, 134]. Mathemati-
cally, the problem amounts to solving a set of coupled nonlinear Volterra integro-differential equations:
y′
i(t) = Φi[t, y(t)] +
Z
D∈[t0,t]
ds Ki[t, s, y(s)] ≡gi(t, y) ,
y(t0) = y0.
(S.19)
Note that the Bethe–Salpeter-type equations (S.9) have a similar form, albeit with y′
i(t) ≡0 on the left-hand side. We solve these
equations numerically using the iterative Heun’s scheme,

y(0)
n+1 = yn + ∆t g(tn, yn) ,

and employing the trapezoidal rule to compute the memory integrals. The correction step is iterated until the desired convergence
is reached. A measure of convergence for given tolerances is

n+1 −y(k)

(S.21)
where ∥·∥p denotes the standard Lp-norm, with p = 2 chosen in this work. The step is accepted if ϵ(k)
n+1 < 1. For all data
presented, we used atol = 10−8 and rtol = 10−6. The timestep for all plots except Fig. 2(b) was taken as ∆t = 0.25 in units of
ω0. The points in Fig. 2(b) were evaluated on a coarser grid with timestep ∆t = 0.4 instead. In all cases, the evolution time
was fixed to τevol = 400, corresponding to Nt = 1600 timesteps for the finer lattice and Nt = 1000 timesteps for the coarser
lattice, respectively. Note that ∆t is much smaller than any other timescale (ω−1
0 , λ−1, etc.) in the problem, which implies that all
relevant physical processes were resolved.
SPIN CORRELATION FUNCTIONS
In this work, we restrict ourselves to spatially homogeneous states. In this case, it is suggestive to work in Fourier space:
fk =
X
j
eik·j fj ,
fj = N−1 X
k
e−ik·j fk .
(S.22)
To capture the antiferromagnetic nature of the Rydberg interaction, we then introduce even and odd sublattices, denoted by A
and B, respectively. Consequently, correlation functions involving spatial dependence will carry sublattice indices: Ga, Dχχ
k,ab,
Dχϕ
a , where a, b ∈{A, B}. In addition, the original Brillouin zone is replaced by two magnetic (or reduced) Brillouin zones, each
twice as small as the original one. For a two-dimensional square lattice with unit lattice spacing, the reciprocal basis of the
reduced Brillouin zone (RBZ) is spanned by the vectors G1 = (π, π)T and G2 = (π, −π)T. The map back to the original Brillouin
zone is given by

(S.23)
where r0 is the displacement vector between the two sublattices, which for the simple square lattice with unit lattice spacing can
be chosen as either (1, 0)T or (0, 1)T.
As discussed in [93], the HS correlator can be readily mapped to a connected spin correlation function:
˜Dχχ
ij (t, t′) ≡Dχχ
ij (t, t′) −iVijδC(t −t′) = VimVjl

(S.24)
Going to momentum space, the expression takes a particularly simple form in the limit Ns →1: Czz

k.
Decomposing the nonsingular part ˜Dχχ
k (t, t′) of the HS propagator as shown in (S.13) then allows one to extract spectral and
statistical properties of the spin degrees of freedom and thus probe for their thermalization using the generalized fluctuation-
dissipation relation, as discussed in the main text. It is worth noting that, despite what Eq. (S.24) might naively suggest, the
