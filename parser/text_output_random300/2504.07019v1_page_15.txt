FIG. S2. Illustration different truncation schemes for NH-NRG for the free Wilson chain with imaginary on-site potentials. The
four truncation schemes discussed in the text are shown, comparing NH-NRG results (red diamonds) with exact diagonalization
(black circle points) for the complex eigenvalues of ˆHN for different iterations N. The full spectrum from exact diagonalization
is shown in each case; NH-NRG reconstructs a different part of this spectrum due to the different truncation schemes employed.
Plotted for Λ = 3 and Nk = 400.
