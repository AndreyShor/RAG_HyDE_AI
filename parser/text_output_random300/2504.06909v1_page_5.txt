2. Methodology
a. Numerical experiments
In this study, we use the GCM Isca (Vallis et al. 2018) in a relatively idealized moist aquaplanet
configuration. The model, based on the GFDL dynamical core (Gordon and Stern 1982), solves the
moist primitive equations in vorticity-divergence form on 40 (unevenly spaced) ùúélevels (Bourke
1974) at T42 horizontal resolution.
Latent heat of condensation and the radiative effects of water vapor are simulated, with the
former represented through the large-scale condensation parameterization of Frierson et al. (2006).
A standard Betts-Miller scheme for moist convection is also employed (Betts 1986; Betts and Miller
1986). Radiative fluxes are computed using the comprehensive SOCRATES scheme (Manners
et al. 2017), with a CO2 concentration of 300 ppm and a modern ozone climatology. There is a
diurnal cycle in the model but no seasonal cycle; a permanent equinox configuration is used for
insolation. Clouds are not represented in our configuration of the model and the radiative effect of
aerosols is not taken into account.
The lower boundary is a global slab ocean with a 20 m mixed layer depth. We impose prescribed
meridional heat fluxes in the ocean, following Merlis et al. (2013). Sea ice is not represented in
the model and the surface temperature is allowed to reach values below 0‚ó¶C. The surface albedo is
prescribed to 0.25 and standard drag laws govern the exchanges of momentum, sensible and latent
heat at the surface, based on Monin-Obukhov theory as described in Frierson et al. (2006).
This type of idealized configuration (with variations regarding, for example, how radiative
transfer is treated or whether prescribed or interactive SSTs are used) has been used extensively,
not only as an evaluation framework for model intercomparison (Neale and Hoskins 2000a,b; Lee
et al. 2008) but also as a conceptual framework to connect theory with numerical models which
remain interpretable (Blackburn and Hoskins 2013). For instance, similar configurations have
been used to study meridional energy transport (Caballero and Langen 2005; Frierson et al. 2007;
Rose and Ferreira 2012; Merlis et al. 2022) and the water cycle (O‚ÄôGorman and Schneider 2008;
Byrne and Schneider 2016; Donohoe et al. 2019) over a range of climates, the response of the
Hadley cells to various forcings (Levine and Schneider 2011; Merlis et al. 2013; Hilgenbrink and
