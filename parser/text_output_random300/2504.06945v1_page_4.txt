The imaginary part of the self-energy represents the lifetime of the underlying quasiparticles.
For a Fermi liquid,
the self-energy turns out to be proportional to ω2, which is much smaller than the excitation energy ω, in the limit
ω ≪1. This is the reason why we can define long-lived Landau quasiparticles for a normal metal (or Fermi liquid).
But here we find that ImΣ ∝|ω|

3 , whose magtinude is much much greater than |ω| in the limit ω →0. Thus the
quasiparticle-picture fails for the Ising-nematic QCP, making the traditional Boltzmann formalism inadequate to derive
the corresponding kinetic equations.
A.
Keldysh formalism
To deal with a generic nonquilibrium situation, a widely used method is to use the closed-time Keldysh contour [41].
Using the field operators on the forward and the backward branches of the time contour, we write down the total Keldysh
action, as shown in Refs. [35, 36]. which we do not repeat here. The Keldysh formalism comes to include various types of
Green’s functions, which appear as a consequence of the respective locations of their time arguments on the folded contour.
These are shown in Appendex A for the sake of completeness. Using these ingredients, we finally change the spacetime
coordinates to (trel = t1 −t2, rrel = r1 −r2) and (t = t1+t2
2
, r = r1+r2
2
), which are also known as the Wigner coordinates.
While the former refers to the relative coordinates, the latter comprises the centre-of-mass description. Through this step,
we can easily describe the system in the equilibrium limit, because the dependence on (t, r) drops out due to the emergent
translational insurance both in time and space, causing all the Green’s functions to depend only on (trel, rrel). Defining
k1 ≡(ωk1, k1) and k2 ≡(ωk2, k2) to be the canonically conjugate energy-momentum variables of x1 ≡(t1, r1) and
x2 ≡(t2, r2), respectively, we can then easily perform our calculations by going to the Fourier space, with the canonically
conjugate variable defined as k = k1−k2
2
. In a generic nonequilibrium situation, the additional dependence on (trel, rrel)
needs to be accounted for, when we can use the canonically conjugate variables q = k1 + k2, respectively. For the sake
of notational simplification, we define the shorthand symbols of xrel = (trel, rrel), k ≡(ωk, k) and q ≡(ωq, q) [and set
ωq = Ω], combining everything into three-vectors.

Equilibrium properties and generalized distribution functions
For our system, the explicit expressions for the bare (aka noninteracting) Green’s functions, at equilibrium, are given

for the fermions and the bosons, respectively. The superscripts “R” and “A” refer to the “retarded” and ”advanced” ones,
respectively. The expressions follow straightforwardly from Eqs. (6) and (7). While performing the analytic continuation,
i k0 →ωk + i 0+, one has to use

and an analogous relation for the case of i k0 →ωk −i 0+, required to derive DA
1 . We note that α represents the analogue
of the fine-structure constant of the electromagnetic interactions.
The feedback of the overdamped bosons on the fermions are computed via the the retarded and advanced fermion self-
energies at one-loop order. The equilibrium expressions for these self-energies at one-loop order, after analytic continuation
of Eq. (8) to real frequencies, are obtained as
