architecture, when paired with HOSVD, was sufficient to achieve accurate predictions,
effectively capturing simpler dynamics. However, the addition of one or more dense layers
in the LSTM architecture displayed an improvement across various metrics, specifically
along the spanwise and normal directions. The LSTM 2 dense and LSTM time-distributed
configurations enhanced the predictive accuracy across all the datasets. The RRMSE
metrics further reinforced these observations, with HOSVD achieving lower error values
across all LSTM architectures. In particular, the LSTM 2 dense architecture achieved the
lowest RRMSE for HOSVD, underscoring its ability to balance complexity and prediction
accuracy in turbulent flow cases. They help to preserve uncorrelated dynamics connected
to small flow scales typically found in transient and turbulent flows.
The comparison between the HOSVD-based LSTM 2 dense and the time-distributed
model reveals minimal differences in metrics and snapshot predictions across all cases.
However, the time-distributed architecture performs better in the spanwise predictions for
