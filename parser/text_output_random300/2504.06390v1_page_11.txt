Figure 1: Zero-energy Landau level branches (E0+ and E0âˆ’) as a function of magnetic field
strength for different polar substrates: h-BN, SiC, SiO2, and HfO2. (a) Without and (b)
with an applied in-plane electric field (F = 0.3 V/nm).
(compared to 206meV for SiO2) weakens the polaronic effect despite stronger polarization.
Thus, both parameters must be considered jointly to predict the resulting energy shifts.
With the electric field applied (Figure 1(b)), the splitting becomes more pronounced for
all substrates. The electric field breaks the in-plane symmetry and enhances the localization
of the carriers, reinforcing the interaction with SO phonons. We observe that the electric field
refines the energy for low values of the magnetic field. For large values of the magnetic field
the energy is constant for F = 0 but increases for F other than 0. This cooperative effect
between electric and magnetic fields amplifies the polaron-induced energy gap, providing a
tunable mechanism for gap engineering.
These observations are consistent with prior studies on polaron effects in low-dimensional
systems such as quantum dots,32,33 where similar external field configurations lead to en-
hanced optical transitions. Importantly, the formation of the gap facilitates interband tran-
sitions at the zero Landau level, implying that surface polar phonons can activate optical
