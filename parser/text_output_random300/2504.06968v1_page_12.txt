In the process of calibrating the ∆χ2 test distribution through simulation, the intensity, lo-
cation and width of the line, are not fixed to predetermined values but are allowed to vary freely
during the fit. This is a standard setup when performing the simulation. The number of indepen-
dent search trials conducted by dividing multiple time intervals in the time series of different GRBs
must be considered (the look-elsewhere effect59). The chance probability value p-valuesim-trial after
considering the correction for the number of independent search trials on the basis of the p-valuesim
is 59–61:
p-valuesim-trial = 1 −(1 −p-valuesim)t.

where t is the number of independent search trials. We searched for GRBs spectral lines from the
Fermi-GBM catalog (https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/fermi/fermigbrst.html) in descend-
ing order of fluence29. We excluded GRB 221009A, which already has identified narrow emission
features 22,23. The extreme brightness of GRB 130427A and GRB 230307A caused detector pile-
up effects, so we excluded the saturated time intervals of 4.5−11.5 s for GRB 130427A and 3−7 s
for GRB 230307A62,63. We searched a total of 9 GRBs, for each burst, time intervals were divided
based on BGO light curve signal-to-noise ratio greater than 40. This resulted in a total of 256
searches. Therefore, the number of independent search trials t = 256.
We found the highest statistical significance of narrow emission feature in the time interval
8 −30 s, with the chance probability value p-valuesim < 1 × 10−7 obtained from results of 1.00 ×
107 simulations, corresponding to the Gaussian-equivalent significance > 5.32σ. Considering the
correction for the number of independent search trials, the chance probability value decreases to
p-valuesim-trial < 2.56 × 10−5, corresponding to the Gaussian-equivalent significance > 4.20σ.
The chance probability values for the other time intervals are shown in Table 2.
