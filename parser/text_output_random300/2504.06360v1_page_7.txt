Resonant condition for the waves emitted in the su-
personic regime
The dispersion (17) in the main text can be verified
by comparison with the results of direct numerical sim-
ulations. We perform numerical simulations of the one-
dimensional version of (14) perturbed by a moving po-
tential
V = V0exp(−(x −vpt)2
w2p
),
(1)
where V0 = 0.3 meV , wp = 0.56 µm. The initial condi-
tions are taken in the form of a resting spatially uniform
condensate of the density ρ0 = 50 µm−2.
We observe that the potential produces a radiation tail
if the velocity is high enough; in the spectral domain, this
effect leads to the appearance of a narrow resonant line.
The position kr of this spectral line can be found from the
dispersion characteristics by solving the phase-matching
condition
Re[ω(kr)] = vpkr.
(2)
So, the resonant wavevector is a function of velocity
kr(vp).
This dependency is shown in Fig. 1(a) by the
solid curve. The positions of the resonant spectral lines
observed in the numerical simulations of (14) are shown
by the blue circles in the same plot. One can see that all
dots are situated on the analytical curve, and so we can
claim that the numerical simulations are in very good
agreement with the numerics.
To check the imaginary part of the dispersion charac-
teristic, we can extract the decay rate of the resonantly
emitted waves in the numerical simulations of (14). We
observe that in the stationary regime, the wave reso-
nantly emitted by the moving obstacle decays exponen-
tially in space, with a certain propagation length Ld de-
pending on the velocity of the obstacle.
The relative
velocity of the radiation with respect to the potential is
|vg −vp|, where vg = Re[∂kω|kr] is the group velocity of
the emitted waves. Thus, the spatial decay rate

Ld is
related to the decay rate in time as

So, the imaginary part of the dispersion can be extracted

FIG. 1.
Panel (a) shows the dependence of the resonant
wavevector of the emitted waves on the velocity of the mov-
ing localized potential obtained from the phase matching con-
dition. The blue circles show the positions of the resonant
spectral lines in the spatial spectrum of the condensate field
obtained by direct numerical simulations of Eq.(14) in the
main text. Panel (b) shows the dependency of the imaginary
part of the dispersion characteristic (solid line) and the decay
rate of the resonant radiation extracted from the numerical
simulations. The simulations and analytics are done for the
spatially uniform condensate of density ρ0 = 50 µm−2, the
polariton-polariton interaction g = 6 · 10−3meV · µm2, the
energy relaxation λ = 1.4 · 10−3µm4 · ps−1, the potential is
given by V = V0exp(−(x−vpt)2

The imaginary parts of the eigenfrequencies found by for-
mula (14) are shown in panel (b) of Fig. 1 by the solid
line. The blue circles show the eigenfrequencies extracted
from the numerical simulations. It can be seen that the
decay rate found in the numerical simulations also agrees
well with its analytical counterpart.
The development of the instability
Let us discuss the stability of the condensate moving in
the reference frame at a velocity higher than the critical
velocity. As long as the velocity in the laboratory refer-
ence frame is less than the critical velocity of the conden-
sate, the condensate is stable, according to formula (19)
in the main text. This analytical result perfectly matches
our numerical simulations of (14) in the main text with
initial conditions taken in the form of a spatially uniform
condensate perturbed by weak noise. All excitations de-
cay in time, and the stationary state is the condensate
