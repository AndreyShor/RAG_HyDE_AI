Figure 2: OPAL utilizes a multi-head architecture to process the data observed over the course of a task
rather than relying on purely data-driven priors.
The theoretical foundation rests on the formal description
of string configurations on edges of a lattice, governed by
local fusion rules. These fusion rules specify mathemati-
cally which configurations can meet at vertices, analogous
to how certain actions can only follow or precede others in
a physically valid sequence. The fusion rules are encoded
by tensors F ij
k that specify the amplitude for configura-
tions i and j to fuse into configuration k. For physical
consistency, these tensors must satisfy mathematical con-
sistency conditions known as the pentagon and hexagon
equations:

These equations ensure that global consistency emerges
from the local rules, a property essential for generating
physically valid action sequences.
We establish a formal mapping from this topological
field theory to robotic action sequences. Action tokens
correspond to string types in the topological formalism.
Physical prerequisites and constraints correspond to
fusion rules. Invariant physical properties, such as object
integrity, correspond to topological charges.
Physical
consistency conditions correspond to the pentagon and
hexagon equations of the topological theory.
This
mapping provides a mathematically rigorous framework
for imposing physical constraints on robotic action
generation.
We formally define our topological attention mechanism
as:

Att(Q, K, V ) = softmax

The topological mask Mtopo encodes the physical con-
straints:

Mtopo(i, j) =

F ij
k · δ(C(i, j, k))
where F ij
k represents the fusion coefficient between ac-
tion tokens, and C(i, j, k) enforces consistency condi-
tions.
Unlike standard attention mechanisms that learn uncon-
strained relationships between tokens, topological atten-
tion operates within a mathematically constrained man-
ifold of physically valid configurations. This constraint
provides several formal advantages.
It enforces physi-
cal consistency by restricting information flow to valid
configurations, mathematically guaranteed by the proper-
ties of Mtopo. The approach improves sample efficiency
by constraining the action space, reducing the effective
dimensionality of the learning problem.
The topologi-
cal constraints represent universal physical principles that
generalize across tasks, a property derived from the task-
independence of the underlying physical laws. Further-
more, the structure of Mtopo provides interpretability by
revealing the physical constraints the model has learned.
The implementation incorporates a three-level hierarchy
of fusion rules, each with formal mathematical properties
that ensure physical consistency at different scales.
At the most granular level, local fusion rules govern in-
teractions between adjacent action tokens within a primi-
tive. These rules ensure basic physical consistency, such
as ensuring that a gripper must open before grasping. For-
mally:

is the fusion tensor determining whether ac-

one valid continuation, a necessary condition for physical
feasibility.
At an intermediate level, non-local fusion channels en-
able long-range dependencies with topological protection.
These channels ensure that distant parts of the action se-
quence remain physically consistent even when they do
