Following Ref. [47] we employ the concurrence C as a
convenient measure of entanglement. For a normalized
state |ψ⟩= (α, ζ, β, δ)T the concurrence is defined by
C := 2|αδ −βζ|.

As initial conditions we choose the four Bell states (see
Ref. [47])

For these maximally entangled states the concurrence C
is unity. Figure 1(a) shows that at the EP C decays for
all Bell states as predicted by the phenomenon of EP-
induced disentanglement, except for |e4⟩where C stays
constant.
The latter is consistent with the discussion
around Eq. (5) in Sec. III as |e4⟩is an eigenstate of
the Hamiltonian. Slightly away from the EP, the situ-
ation can change drastically (here for ε > 0), as shown
in Fig. 1(b). The concurrence recovers, reaching values
up to unity. This phenomenon is referred to in Ref. [47]
as the speeding up of entanglement in the proximity of
an EP. For ε < 0 (not shown) we do not observe the
recovering of the concurrence which again is consistent
with Ref. [47] where the entanglement generation only
appears in the parity-time-unbroken regime.
Finally, let us mention that Eq. (41) can be used for
an alternative proof of Eq. (28). To do so, we utilize the
property of the Kronecker sum [64]

From Eq. (1) then follows for the time evolution opera-
tor (38) of the composite system
ˆK(t) = e−i
ℏˆ
HAt ⊗e−i
ℏˆ
HBt = ˆKA(t) ⊗ˆKB(t)
(46)
where ˆKA(t) and ˆKB(t) are the time-evolution operators
of system A and B. From Eq. (41) we conclude that ˆKA(t)
behaves asymptotically as tnA−1 and ˆKB(t) as tnB−1.
Hence, according to Eq. (46), ˆK(t) behaves asymptot-
ically as tnA+nB−2. This is in agreement with an EP of
order n given by Eq. (28), see also Ref. [65].

FIG. 1. Time evolution of concurrence C [Eq. (42)] for four
initial Bell states |ej⟩[Eqs. (43)-(44)] in the composite non-
Hermitian system defined by Eqs. (1) and (8). Time t is in
dimensionless units. (a) ε = 0, i.e., the system is at the EP.
(b) ε = 0.01, i.e., the system is not at the EP but close to it.
revealed a number of interesting findings to be summa-
rized in this section.
If each individual system exhibits a leading-order ex-
ceptional point of some order nα then the composite sys-
tem exhibit a single leading-order exceptional point with
order n [Eq. (35)] larger than any of the nα.
This is
an interesting mechanism for creating higher-order ex-
ceptional points that might have applications, e.g., for
sensing. A perturbation that involves all subsystems—a
global perturbation—can be a generic perturbation yield-
ing a large splitting with ε1/n-scaling. In contrast, lo-
cal perturbations restricted to a given system lead to a
smaller splitting with ε1/nα-scaling. Hence a sensor de-
vice where the signal is given by a global perturbation
(interaction of the systems) is, in this sense, protected
against local perturbations, such as decoherence due to
the local environment.
Since the order of the EP given by Eq. (35) is less
than the total algebraic multiplicity, there are additional
eigenstates that must be entangled. This is highly re-
markable, but it seems that it does not have any obvious
physical consequences. It is, for instance, not related to
the reported speeding up of entanglement in the proxim-
ity of an EP [47].
A simple equation [Eq. (37)] for the spectral response
strength of the higher-order EP has been derived in terms
of the response strengths of the leading-order EPs in the
individual systems.
Ultimately, we unveiled the surprising phenomenon of
EP-induced disentanglement, which occurs without any
interactions between the individual systems.
We believe that our findings contribute significantly to
the deeper understanding of non-Hermitian quantum sys-
tems and may help to advance practical applications in
