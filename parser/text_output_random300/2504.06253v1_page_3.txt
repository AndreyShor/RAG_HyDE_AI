Quadratic Combinatorial Optimization Problems
Here we only consider two types of (quadratic) problems. Given a symmetric matrix 𝑄∈R𝑛×𝑛the associated
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimzation (QUBO) problem is [10, 11]
max
𝑥∈{0,1}𝑛𝑥𝑇𝑄𝑥
(1)
Notice that this structure allows for linear terms as well because for 𝑥∈{0, 1}𝑛, 𝑥2
𝑖= 𝑥𝑖for all 𝑖= 1, 2, . . . ,𝑛, and
hence,
𝑥𝑇𝑄𝑥+ 𝜇𝑇𝑥= 𝑥𝑇(𝑄+ diag(𝜇))𝑥.
(2)
Likewise for a symmetric matrix 𝐽∈R𝑛×𝑛the corresponding Ising Problem is
max
𝑦∈{−1,1}𝑛𝑦𝑇𝐽𝑦.
(3)
With this definition, Ising problems, unlike QUBOs, do not allow for linear terms.
Ising problems are closely related to the Ising model studied in physics, which is a statistical model for spin
couplings in ferromagnetic materials [12, 13].1
Here we define a well-studied combinatorial optimization problem: (weighted) Max-Cut [14–16] where the
objective is to partition the vertices of a weighted graph into two disjoint groups so that the sum of the weights
of the edges between the groups is maximized. More formally, given a graph 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸) with weighted adjacency
matrix 𝐴, Max-Cut can be written as the following maximization problem:
max
𝑦∈{−1,+1}𝑛𝐶(𝑦),
(4)
with,
𝐶(𝑦) = 1

∑︁
1≤𝑖,𝑗≤𝑛
𝐴(1 −𝑦𝑖𝑦𝑗),
(5)
where the elements of {−1, 1}|𝑉| are referred to as cuts with corresponding cut-value of 𝐶(𝑦).
This differs by a constant value from the Ising problem associated with −𝐴/4,
𝐶(𝑦) = 𝑦𝑇


4𝐴

𝑦+ 1
4sum(𝐴).
(6)
We call the Ising problem associated with −𝐴/4 the Max-Cut problem for graph 𝐺.
The (instance-specific) cut ratio of 𝑦is given by
𝛼(𝑦) =
𝐶(𝑦) −min𝑦∈{−1,1}𝑛𝐶(𝑦)
max𝑦∈{−1,1}𝑛𝐶(𝑦) −min𝑦∈{−1,1}𝑛𝐶(𝑦) .
1In the context of physical systems, the addition of a linear term would correspond to the introduction of an external magnetic field.
