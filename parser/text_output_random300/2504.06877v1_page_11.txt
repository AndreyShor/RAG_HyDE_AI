allow us to neglect any nonlinear effects in the dynamics of the LC-circuit induced by the
junction [51, 58, 59]. We also assume that the drive frequency of the junction is highly off-

LrCr. This condition allows us to neglect the off-resonant Josephson
current related to the driving field as well as frequency conversion of the microwave field in
the resonator. Thus, the dynamics of the resonator flux degree of freedom φr is governed by
the following equation:

Here, we assume that the noise component of the current (see Eq. (11)) is not affected by the
flux degree of freedom φr of the LC-circuit but only by the external drive (16). The solution
of this equation can be expressed through the retarded Green’s function of the resonator:

We also define the Keldysh Green’s function of the LC-circuit as a flux-flux correlator
