This corresponds to say that the PDFs introduced in Eqs. (1.38) and (1.55) are unmeasurable

for each collinear gluon emission.
As the final structure function in l.h.s of Eq. (1.59) must be independent on the choice of the
factorization scale, it is possible to derive a differential equation which properly resums the
collinear emissions inside the physical PDF.
It is possible to show that the singularities arising in the parton model correspond precisely to
the infrared divergences of the PDF, defined with the operator point of view, when these are
evaluated for on-shell massless partonic states [49, 50].
1.3.2. DGLAP equations
The dependency of the PDFs on the factorization scale is governed by the RGEs, known as the
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) equations [51, 52, 53]

where Pij are the Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions, ⊗denotes the Mellin convolution and the
sum runs over all the active flavors. As the splitting kernels are not diagonal, Eq. (1.60) is a
system of coupled equations. However, the gluon distribution has to be flavor blind and couples
only with the total quark PDF. Thus, it is possible to maximally disentangle the system, rotating
to the evolution basis
