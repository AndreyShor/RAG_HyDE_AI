regions. The action of the linear perturbation in an updraft region on the conditional
instability remains the same, for each of the different parameter values: ˆb < 0 in the
lower region, which extends to just below zs (and just above the LFC). There is a
reduction in the pCAPE in the upper region where ˆb > 0, and a sharp change in the
gradient of ˆb (and ˆq) just above zs.

Buoyancy eigenvectors at criticality, plotted for varying: surface temperature (top left), surface
relative humidity (top right), and radiative cooling (bottom). Dashed lines mark the LFCs and dotted lines
mark the LCLs of the different environments. The eigenvectors are normalised such that max(wr) = 5 × 10−4
and wi = 0.
The buoyancy and moisture fluxes can be used to give an initial indication of
the non-linear transport of buoyancy and moisture. Figure 15 shows how the
horizontally averaged vertical transport of the buoyancy perturbation ( ˆwˆb ∼⟨w′b′⟩)
changes with the climate parameters. Apart from the RHsurf = 0.974 case, all of
the buoyancy fluxes w′b′ display a similar structure: they have a negative peak of
flux in the lower region, which occurs just below the LFC and a larger positive peak
in the upper region. The height of the positive peak is dependent on zs, such that
if zs increases, we expect the height of the positive flux to increase with it. The
nearly saturated RHsurf = 0.974 case does not exhibit a significant region of negative
flux, which we conjecture is a result of the CIN being close to zero in this region.
The perturbation moisture flux is shown in Figure 16. Again, the nearly saturated
case shows different behaviour than the rest of the parameter values displayed. The
general behaviour of the moisture flux shows the peak moisture flux occurs around
the LFC and below zs, with a second smaller peak occurring in the upper saturated
