For our particular example and choice of gauge, Cφφφ =
30(1−9
5 φ)
φ3(1−27φ)(1+27φ2).
The metric on the
moduli space is Gφφ = ∂φ∂φK, which defines the Levi-Civita connection L on M. The holomorphic
3-form Ωis a section of the K¨ahler line bundle L−1 over M.
The B-model free energies F(g)(φ, φ) are polynomials in certain propagator functions Sφφ, Sφ, S,
as well as the K¨ahler potential K. These propagators are respectively sections of L2 ⊗Sym2(TM),
L2 ⊗TM, and L2. They are defined as anholomorphic potentials17,
∂φSφφ = GφφGφφ Cφφφ,
∂φSφ = −KφGφφGφφ Cφφφ,
∂φS = 1
2KφKφGφφGφφ Cφφφ,
(A.2)
where Kφ = ∂φK. The integrated special geometry relation is used in practice to compute Sφφ.
This reads18
CφφφSφφ = −Lφ
φφ + 2δφ
φKφ + sφ
φφ.
(A.3)
Here sφ
φφ is a propagator ambiguity, a holomorphic function of φ that we can freely choose. sφ
φφ
is not a tensor, and under a coordinate transformation has the same transformation law as the
Christoffel symbol Lφ
φφ so that the LHS of (A.3) is tensorial.
The BCOV ring Q(φ)[Sφφ, Sφ, S] is closed under differentiation. To see this, one takes a covariant
derivative of any of (A.2) using the K¨ahler and Levi-Civita connections. The special geometry
relation [∂φ, Dφ]φ
φ = ∂φLφ
φφ = 2δφ
φGφφ−CφφφC
φφ
φ
allows one to change the order of differentiation,
and then everything can be collected under a ∂φ that is removed at the expense of adding a
holomorphic ‘constant of integration’ tensor h•
• with the appropriate legs. This leads to
∂φSφφ = CφφφSφφSφφ + 2δφ
φSφ −2sφ
φφSφφ + hφφ

∂φSφ = CφφφSφφSφ + 2δφ

2CφφφSφSφ −hφφSφ + hφ,
∂φKφ = KφKφ −CφφφSφφKφ + sφ
φφKφ −CφφφSφ + hφφ.
(A.4)
There is a freedom in choosing the propagator ambiguities h•
•, sφ
φφ. We make a choice
sφ
φφ = 0,
hφφ
φ
= 0,
hφ
φ = 0.
(A.5)
The h•
• are tensors, and so choosing any of them to be zero in a patch leads to them being zero
in every patch. However, sφ
φφ has the same transformation law as a Christoffel symbol and so our
choice sφ
φφ = 0 gives sϕ
ϕϕ = −2/ϕ.
The BCOV closure relations (A.4) and integrated special geometry relation (A.3) then provide the
remaining propagator ambiguities, in addition to the propagators themselves. First one reads off
Sφφ from (A.3) - to do this, one must divide by Cφφφ. One then reads off hφφ from the fourth
equation in (A.4), then reads off Sφ from the first equation in (A.4), then reads off S from the
second equation in (A.4), and finally reads off hi from the third equation in (A.4). Before we
actually do this, we will pass to the holomorphic limit. This will need to be done anyway when
17Note that these relations are not [66, equation (4.27)]. The equations (A.2) define the tilded propagators in (4.29)
of [66], which we display here without tildes.
18We are working in the one-parameter setting. In (A.3), one should read 2δφ
φKφ as δl
iKj +δl
jKi with l = i = j = φ.
We shall throughout this section write δφ
φ instead of 1 where appropriate, so that there is no abuse of indices.
