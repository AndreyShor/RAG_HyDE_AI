Fig. 11: Left: Comparison of the inferred parameters of the Be star companion to MIST single star evolutionary tracks. The position
of the Be star in the HRD is consistent with a MBe,evol = 6.5 ± 0.9 M⊙B-type dwarf.
Right: Summary of constraints on stellar mass for the Be star companion. The temperature and luminosity-based mass estimate is
shown as a red horizontal line, with the shaded region indicating the uncertainty estimate. The spectroscopic mass is shown in black
with the uncertainties exceeding the plotted mass range. Blue, green, and grey curves indicate Be star masses inferred from the
binary mass function (fbin) as a function of inclination angle. The different colours correspond to different estimates of the mass of
the stripped star; MB,spec = 0.69 M⊙as inferred from the spectroscopic analysis and MB,evol = 0.99 M⊙, the stripped star mass of the
best-fit MESA evolutionary model. Note that for the Be star, the minimum allowed dynamical mass; MBe,dyn ≥7.0 M⊙assuming
MB = 0.69 M⊙; is somewhat larger than the inferred evolutionary mass.
Fig. 10 compares the fitted model SED to observed pho-
tometry. A corner plot of the posterior PDFs for all parameters
is provided in Fig. H.1 in the Appendix. We find good agree-
ment between models and data for a reddening of E(B −V) =
0.69 ± 0.06 mag with RV = 2.7 ± 0.5, although the latter is
less constrained. The inferred extinction AV = E(B −V)RV ≈
1.88+0.36
−0.32 mag is consistent with values inferred in the Milky Way
dust extinction map by Zhang & Green (2024). We infer a radius
of RB = 9.0+2.1
−1.7 R⊙for the narrow-lined B star. With a light ratio
of fB/( fB + fBe) = 0.6 ± 0.08 at 4300 Å, this yields a radius of
the broad-lined Be star of RBe = 6.0+1.6
−1.3 R⊙. All values quoted
here are the medians of the posterior PDFs, with the uncertain-
ties corresponding to the 68% quantiles.
7.2. Stellar masses and luminosities
We applied the Stefan-Boltzmann law to infer the stellar lumi-
nosities of both stars from the samples in the equally weighted
posterior distribution of the SED fit. We report median values
with 1-σ uncertainties, yielding LB/L⊙= 2300+1300
−800
for the
narrow-lined B star and LBe/L⊙= 2700+1600
−1100 for the broad-lined
Be companion. Similarly, we combined the posterior samples
for radii and surface gravities to estimate stellar masses using
Newton’s law of gravitation; g = GM/R2, yielding MB,spec/M⊙=
0.69+0.63
−0.31 and MBe,spec/M⊙= 10.5+21.5
−7.1 .
The inferred spectroscopic mass of the narrow-lined B-type
star is much lower than the value of 4.9 ± 0.2 M⊙inferred by
Gaia Collaboration et al. (2023a) based on single-star evolution-
ary tracks, and it is unreasonably low for a regular B5 supergiant
(e.g., Haucke et al. 2018). Together with the low inferred sur-
face gravity and large radius, this suggests that, similar to LB-1
(Shenar et al. 2020) and HR 6819 (Bodensteiner et al. 2020a; El-
Badry & Quataert 2021), the narrow-lined star in HIP 15429 is a
bloated stripped star. In this scenario, the initially more massive
star in the binary got stripped of its envelope, transferring mass
to its companion and leaving it in a short evolutionary stage with
inflated size, hence the term "bloated", and temperatures in the
mid- to late-B regime. For a more detailed discussion of the evo-
lutionary history of the system, see Sect. 8.
The inferred spectroscopic mass of the Be star is higher than
those of typical B stars of similar temperatures (Pecaut & Ma-
majek 2013), but note the substantial uncertainties due to poorly
constrained surface gravity. However, we can get independent
evolutionary and dynamic mass estimates of the companion. The
evolutionary mass estimate is illustrated in Fig. 11, where the in-
ferred spectroscopic temperature and luminosity of the Be star
are compared to a selection of stellar evolution tracks of sin-
gle B-type stars from the MESA Isochrones & Stellar Tracks
(MIST) library (Dotter 2016; Choi et al. 2016; Paxton et al. 2011,
2013, 2015, 2018, 2019; Jermyn et al. 2023). We used a grid
of stellar evolution tracks of solar metallicity with masses be-
tween 4 and 9 M⊙in steps of 0.1 M⊙. Each track was sampled at
1000 evenly spaced time steps, resulting in a regular grid of pre-
dicted stellar effective temperatures, luminosities, and masses.
The best-fit mass was determined by minimising the χ2 statis-
tic, which quantifies the deviation between observed and pre-
dicted values, weighted by their respective uncertainties. To es-
timate uncertainties, we fitted a parabola to the χ2 distribution
around its minimum and identified the parameter values cor-
responding to χ2
min + 1. This yielded an evolutionary mass of
MBe,evol = 6.5 ± 0.9 M⊙for the Be star.
We can estimate the minimum mass of the companion also
dynamically, by combining the inferred stripped star mass of
MB,spec/M⊙= 0.69+0.63
−0.31 with the binary mass function
