Visualization of vortex surfaces in SWAT, displaying hierarchically attached vortex packets with spanwise
meandering features. The vortex surfaces are colour-coded according to the wall distance. (b,c) Comparison

data from Lee & Moser (2015), while solid lines in matching colours represent SWAT. The gray area marks

Our primary objective is to determine whether such vortex assemblies can faithfully
reproduce the mean velocity profile of wall turbulence, particularly the scaling law in the
logarithmic region, which is fundamental to the physics of wall turbulence. Figure 4(b)
presents the mean velocity profile of SWAT, obtained through ensemble-averaging. Com-
pared to DNS data, the SWAT model accurately captures the mean velocity distribution
across different wall distances in turbulent flow. It is important to emphasize that no pre-
averaged flow data from numerical simulations or experiments were used in the construction
of SWAT.
In the near-wall region (with the wall unit ùë¶+ < 5), the velocity profile is primarily
determined by the imposed damping function in (2.12), which controls the flow in the
viscous sublayer. In the logarithmic region (ùë¶+ > 30), the emergence of the log law in
the mean velocity profile arises entirely from the collective contribution of all the hairpin
vortices, without any explicit enforcement. The buffer layer (5 < ùë¶+ < 30) provides a smooth
transition between the viscous sublayer and the logarithmic region, further validating the
self-consistent nature of the synthetic turbulence model.
. Reynolds stresses characterize the momentum transfer induced by turbulent eddies.
Figure 4(c) compares the Reynolds stress components obtained from SWAT with those from
DNS of channel flow. The SWAT effectively reproduces the Reynolds stress distributions
across different wall-normal locations, demonstrating the expected anisotropic characteristics
of wall turbulence. The components ‚ü®ùë£2‚ü©, ‚ü®ùë§2‚ü©, and ‚ü®ùë¢ùë£‚ü©exhibit strong agreement with
DNS data, indicating that the vortex structures incorporated in SWAT capture key features
of momentum transfer. The gray region in figures 4(b,c) highlights the strictly logarithmic
region, defined as 3Re1/2
