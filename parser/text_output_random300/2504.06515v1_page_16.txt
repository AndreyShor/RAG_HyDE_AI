obtained by expanding (91) for p << m, κm|z| << 1. Typically, the sum mc2 + µc2 of the
rest-energies (where we have set c = 1 in the above) is subtracted from the non-relativistic
Hamiltonian (92). However, for a proper comparison of the energy to the relativisitic case,
these terms need to be retained.
Figure 1 shows a comparison between the relativistic case (91) and non-relativistic
case (92) in the phase space of the test particle. Even for the relatively small values of
the total energy, the non-relativistic motion (red) is notably distinct. For the given value
of H = 1.125m and an initial condition of z = 0, the initial momentum p = 0.075m
in the relativistic case as compared to p = 0.071m in the non-relativisitic case. In both
cases, the static mass m attracts the test particle, but in the relativistic case, its momentum
initially decreases less rapidly. However, this situation changes once the particle reaches its
maximal separation from m. This occurs at κm|z| = 1 in the non-relativistic case, but at a
shorter separation κm|z| = 0.89 in the relativistic case—relativistic gravitational attraction
is stronger for the same total energy. One can observe the rather counter-intuitive feature
that the particle is then attracted back to the source even though it has positive momentum
in the relativistic case! The loss of momentum is more rapid than in the non-relativistic
case, and continues to be so until the test particle returns to the origin, after which (in both
cases) the motion repeats.
