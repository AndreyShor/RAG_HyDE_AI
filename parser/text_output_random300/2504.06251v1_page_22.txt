were annealed at 180 ◦C for several hours in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) until sharp dispersions
were observed. Sample regions with different stacking orders were directly distinguished from the
experimental spectra (Extended Data Fig. 4), and the homogeneity across the sample was checked
(Extended Data Fig. 5).
Data shown in Figure 2a,l,m,n were measured at Diamond Light Source at a temperature of
25 K using a photon energy of 75 eV with LC polarization, with total energy resolution better than
33 meV. Other data were measured at SOLEIL at temperature of 78 K using a photon energy of 95
eV with LH polarization, with energy resolution of 40 meV.
Twist angle and electronic structure of two non-aligned R5G/BN samples. The twist angle of
non-aligned R5G/BN samples are determined both from the real-space armchair directions and
momentum-space K points of R5G and BN as shown in Extended Data Fig. 3. Here the twist angle
of non-aligned sample S2 and sample S3 are determined to be 36◦± 1◦and 42◦± 2◦. Extended
Data Fig. 6 shows the comparison of dispersion images measured on sample S2 and sample S3,
showing the same electronic structure intrinsic to R5G despite the different twist angles.
Momentum range of the flat band in non-aligned R5G/BN. Extended Data Fig. 7 shows the
Fermi surface and dispersion images cutting along the Γ-K directions, with a flat band being clearly
observed spanning a momentum range of 0.10 ± 0.02 ˚A
−1 as labeled by black arrows in Extended
Data Fig. 7a,c.
Enhancement of the flat band from EDC analysis along Γ-K direction. Extended Data Fig. 8
shows the dispersion images cutting along the Γ-K direction and the corresponding EDC analysis.
