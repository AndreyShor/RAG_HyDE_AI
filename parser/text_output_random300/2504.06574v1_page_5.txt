Figure 3: Comparison between empirical and simulated datasets. Each black point represents the ensemble
average of the average OF area and the number of passes over 500 simulated games for a set of randomly chosen
parameter values. The simulated dataset covered the empirical data for both high- and low-level teams (cross
markers). The simulated dataset contained 14,105 samples that remained after the preprocessing.
Table 2: Statistically significant effects of model parameters with the significance level of 0.1%. For linear
and square effects, directions of influences, i.e. signs of coefficients, are indicated. For interaction effects, each
entry shows the number of interaction terms whose coefficients were significant. Since we put 13 parameters as
independent variables, there were 12 interaction terms for each parameter.
