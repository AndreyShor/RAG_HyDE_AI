Appendix B: MESA modeling
For our stellar evolution calculations, we utilized the Modules
for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, version
24.08.1 (Paxton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019; Jermyn
et al. 2023). The physical setup follows the framework estab-
lished by Brott et al. (2011). Convection is modeled using the
Ledoux criterion and the standard mixing length theory (Böhm-
Vitense 1958), adopting a mixing length parameter of αmlt = 1.5.
Semiconvective mixing in layers that are stable according to
the Schwarzschild criterion but not the Ledoux criterion is in-
cluded with an efficiency parameter of αsc = 1. For overshoot-
ing, we apply step overshooting for H and He convective cores,
allowing the cores to extend by 0.335 HP, where HP is the pres-
sure scale height at the convective boundary (Brott et al. 2011).
Additionally, thermohaline mixing is incorporated with an effi-
ciency of αth = 1. Rotational mixing is treated as a diffusive
process, accounting for dynamical and secular shear instabili-
ties, the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability, and Eddington-
Sweet circulations (Heger et al. 2000). Consistent with Brott
et al. (2011), we adopt rotational mixing efficiency factors of
fc = 1/30 and fµ = 0.1.
The chemical abundances of H, He, C, N, O, Mg, Si, and
Fe are tailored for the different galaxies following Brott et al.
(2011), with the used values listed in Table B.1. For elements
not explicitly specified, abundances are scaled to the solar val-
ues from Asplund et al. (2005) according to the metallicity of the
galaxy. To reduce computation time all models are only evolved
until core helium depletion. For the most massive stars, con-
vergence issues were encountered during core He-burning. To
address this, we applied the MLT++ prescription, as detailed
in Sect. 7.2 of Paxton et al. (2013), for stars with helium core
masses exceeding M > 12 M⊙.
Within the binary model calculations, mass transfer during
the main sequence is modeled using the “contact” scheme im-
plemented in MESA (Marchant et al. 2016). For subsequent evo-
lutionary stages, we employed the updated mass transfer scheme
from Martins & Palacios (2021), which accounts for outflows
from the outer Lagrangian points.
