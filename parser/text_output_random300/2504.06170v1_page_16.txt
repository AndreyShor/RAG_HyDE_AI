Figure 7. (a) The N(H2) map in the y-z plane at 0.1 Myr, showing the collision of a turbulent molecular cloud (radius = 1.5
pc) and a sea of dense gas moving with a relative velocity of 10 km sâˆ’1 along the z-direction. (b) The N(H2) map in the y-z
plane at 0.4 Myr. Panels (c) and (d) present the PV diagrams along the x- and y-axes, respectively, for a width of 0.4 pc. The
area enclosed by the black lines indicates the velocity of the compressed gas. These figures are taken from Maity et al. (2024).
The schematic diagrams in panels (e) and (f) depict the initial and current configurations of our target filament in position
and velocity space, respectively. The current configuration shows the presence of a HFS at the center of the filament, bubble
N59-North, and its role in creating blue- and red-shifted velocity components. Stars indicate the presence of radio continuum
sources toward N59-North. Similar to Figure 6, the x-z plane represents the plane of the sky, while the y-direction corresponds
to the line of observation. The blue and red arrows represent the blue- and red-shifted velocity components in the filament.
Note that the schematic figures are not to scale.
