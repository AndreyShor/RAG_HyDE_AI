(Note that the ground-state energy density scales differently: E◦∝(µ −m)d/2). At this
point one can straightforwardly find all critical indices which are the same as for the non-
relativistic fermions found in Sec. B 1. In particular, the value of index η′ (B32) can be
inferred directly from (B33). Getting η′ directly from the response and correlation functions
amounts to the calculation of the matter contribution to the polarization operator Π(q) in
lowest order [69], which is straightforward, but tedious. Luckily, it is not necessary, since
the limiting behavior of the correlation functions we need to know to extract η′, corresponds
to the nonrelativistic limit kF ≪m, when the results of Sec. B 1 are applicable.10

The linear gap dependence ∆= m −µ, i.e., zν = 1, implies that z = 2 on the both sides
from the critical point. We also find ν = ν′ which allows us to replace ν′ 7→ν in the results
for the critical indices and thus to conclude that all the scaling relations we found, are the
standard ones known from the theory of critical phenomena. Note however that the equality
ν = ν′ does hold in general.
At µ < m we get an incompressible state, since χ◦= 0, the counterpart of the plateau
states in chains and ladders.

10 For instance, one can check by direct inspection that the matter contribution of the fermionic loop to
Π(q) given in Ch. 6 of [69] yields the series identical (in the limit kF ≪m) to the expansion of L(x) defined
in (B18).
