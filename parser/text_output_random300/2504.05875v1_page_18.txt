Figure 5: Mass of the PBH as a function of the frequency at which the fractional energy density of GWs
peaks and the initial fractional energy density of PBH. The green, pink, and purple bands correspond to
the range of detectable frequencies of the LSD, ET, and LISA GW detectors, respectively.
consider the whole evolution of the PBH, from formation mechanism to their domination
and final evaporation, along with details of inflaton decay. Since the energy density of
SIGWs IGW relies on the PBH domination duration (determined by the inflaton decay
rate (through (3.19)) and the PBH mass fraction (See (3.1) and (3.3)), our results are
significantly different from [62]. Therefore, our considerations of PBH formation details
and inflaton decay produce high-frequency GWs induced by PBH domination in contrast
to the results in [62], which indicate a low-frequency domain. Note that the authors in
[62] evaluate the plot at the late matter-radiation equality, whereas Fig. 5 is evaluated at
present time.

Conclusions
In this work, we have explored the formation and evolution of PBH in an early matter-
dominated universe, focusing on their potential dominance, which provides an alternative
reheating mechanism through Hawking radiation. Our approach focuses on the Khlopov-
Polnarev formalism [17, 21–26, 94] to describe PBH formation during the preheating
(matter-dominated) phase, considering an extended distribution of perturbations rather
than a monochromatic one.
This scenario differs significantly from the standard ones
considered in the literature [62–66], where PBH are considered to form during radiation
domination and the mass fraction is computed using the Press-Schechter formalism [20].
To achieve a significant amount of PBH, we consider a Starobinsky-like inflationary model
[79] with some feature in the potential that amplifies perturbations around a particular
scale, parametrized with a Gaussian peak, eqn. (2.3). PBH domination, in our framework,
