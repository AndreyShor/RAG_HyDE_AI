the motion which do not carry over to the quantum situation. Is it by chance that the
result above relates so simply to near circular orbits for which

We now ask for KLMN problems ”What is the corresponding momentum space
wavefunction, ˜ψE(p), for the distribution of the momentum of WIMPish cloud particles
in a neighbourhood of C0?”. After all, this will affect directly the collision processes
responsible for forming planetesimals and larger heavenly bodies.

on C0, classically, α = θ −ψ0(θ), ψ0(θ) being the angle between the x −axis and the
tangent to C0 at (r0(θ), θ). For the r integral we use
