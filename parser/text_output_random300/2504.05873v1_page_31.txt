to probing muonphilic ALPs. Contrary to the previous scenario, E137 is only relevant for
couplings between about 10−3 GeV−1 and 10−4 GeV−1, and masses above 100 (10) MeV,
for the derivative (pseudoscalar) case. However, if NA64µ extends its programme to 1014
MOT, it is expected to push its constraints down to 10−5 GeV−1, hence totally encompass-
ing E137 ones. Complementary constraints also come from Belle II and from LEP (only in
the derivative case) and SNe. We therefore conclude that, as for Scenario E, the parameter
space is more constrained in the derivative coupling case than in the pseudoscalar coupling
one.
Concerning Scenario T, from figure 12, it becomes clear that currently not many con-
straints are stronger than the unitarity bounds. We also observe that, in this scenario, the
main additional bound comes from E137, which is stronger in the pseudoscalar coupling
case than in the derivative one. As a result, in this scenario, the pseudoscalar coupling
case is more tightly constrained than the derivative one. Current bounds from NA64 have
marginal relevance in the former case, namely only in the ALP mass range 10–30 MeV,
while in the latter one, they improve the unitarity bound by a factor of 2. The final NA64µ
results will be able to provide much stronger constraints, improving the current bound by
about two orders of magnitudes in the coupling and encompassing almost completely the
ones from E137 in the derivative case.
We conclude with Scenario U, for which constraints are reported in figure 13.
As
expected, if the ALP couples to all charged leptons, the different constraints from the three
previous scenarios become relevant simultaneously. We therefore find that the combination
of E137, NA64µ, BaBar and Belle II measurements exclude ALP couplings above about
10−2 GeV−1. The strongest constraint comes again from E137, which pushes the bound
down to almost 10−5 GeV−1 in the 1–200 MeV ALP mass range, while for smaller ALP
masses NA64 excludes couplings larger than 10−3 GeV−1.
With 1014 MOT, NA64µ is
expected to push the coupling bounds down to about 10−5 GeV−1 for ALP masses up to
the muon threshold, going beyond the E137 reach and covering the vast majority of the
currently unconstrained parameter space studied here. For the case of universal couplings to
