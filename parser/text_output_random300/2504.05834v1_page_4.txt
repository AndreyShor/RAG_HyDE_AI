κ, λ0, and θ0. (B) Minimum channel length required for alignment, Lmin, as a function of κ for the same channel geometry as

align the particle. We observe that smaller values of ∆x
generally improve particle guidance, except in the ex-
tremely small wavelength regime (∆x ≪D2 ≤D1), where
the walls eﬀectively become smooth again.
Our key ﬁnding is that particle elongation enhances
alignment success.
The alignment phase diagrams in
Fig. 4 show that decreasing κ increases the range of pa-
rameters that lead to successful alignment. This eﬀect
can be qualitatively understood as elongation increases
the frequency with which the particle encounters high-
velocity nodes, thereby raising the probability of align-
ment. Velocity nodes can be also created through alter-
native techniques, such as acoustic waves [30, 31].
As
shown in Fig. 5A, greater elongation also improves the
robustness of the alignment process against variations in
the particle’s initial entry conditions. We note that in-
creasing the overall particle size expands the successful
alignment regime along both the W and ∆x axes in the
phase diagrams of Fig. 4 (not shown).
The elongation of the particle also inﬂuences the travel
distance required for successful alignment. By averag-
ing over initial entry conditions, Figure 5B shows that
the minimum channel length Lmin required for alignment
doubles as κ increases from 0.1 to 0.5. To explore the
range of Reynolds numbers Re over which alignment oc-
curs, we vary Re by adjusting the dynamic viscosity or
ﬂuid velocity. As shown in Fig. 5C, the alignment phe-
nomenon is not limited to highly viscous ﬂows (Stokes
regime) but persists at higher Re values.
For κ = 0.1,
alignment is observed even at Re on the order of a few
hundred (which approaches the turbulent ﬂow regime),
though Lmin also doubles. While the validity range is
more constrained for larger κ values, alignment is still
consistently observed for Re ∼1−10, which is the typical
range in microﬂuidic devices.
Elongation-induced segregation and applications in mi-
croparticle ﬁltering.— The dependence of the mini-
mum alignment length Lmin on κ can be exploited for
geometry-based microparticle separation.
To demon-
strate elongation-induced segregation, we modify the tex-
tured channel by introducing a narrow bottleneck at the
outlet (Fig. 6A), with a width equal to the immobile disk
diameter δ. An elongated particle with a minor diameter
D2 < δ can pass through only if it aligns with the center-
line. As shown in Fig. 6B (and Suppl. MoviesS4 and S5),
highly elongated particles align quickly, increasing their
chance of passing through, whereas nearly round parti-
cles reach the bottleneck with a random orientation and
lateral position, preventing successful passage. For com-
parison, a particle with κ=0.25 always passes (given a
suﬃciently long channel and a proper texture geometry)
but the success rate drops to ∼15% for κ=0.9; see Fig. 6C
for an ensemble of diﬀerent initial entry conditions.
Since a single trapped particle can block the chan-
nel, a more sophisticated design is required for eﬀec-
tive microﬂuidic ﬁltering.
To address this, we intro-
duce an escape gap (Fig. 6D) that allows elongated par-
ticles to exit while trapping more rounded ones at the
nose with controlled storage capacity.
The sequence
in Fig. 6E conﬁrms that elongated particles successfully
exit, whereas round particles accumulate at the nose (see
also Suppl. Movie S6). This setup serves as a fundamental
unit of a larger ﬁltering device, as illustrated in Fig. 6D.
When a mixture of particles with varying aspect ratios
enters the device, the more rounded particles are stochas-
tically trapped inside the ﬁltering units, while elongated
ones pass through. Consequently, the particles reaching
the outlet are predominantly elongated. The eﬃciency of
the ﬁlter depends on the degree of elongation diﬀerences
within the particle mixture and the storage capacity of
