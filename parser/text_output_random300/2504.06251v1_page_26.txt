Extended Data Fig. 2 | Homogeneity of the moir´e period. a, Optical image of aligned R5G/BN
(sample S1). The red curve indicates R5G region. b, AFM image by zooming in a region indicated
by black dotted box in a. c-h, Lateral-force AFM images to show the moir´e pattern measured at
different positions from P1 to P6 as labeled in b. i, AFM line profiles measured along colored lines
in c-h, with all positions share similar moir´e period of λm = 14.0 ± 0.3 nm.
