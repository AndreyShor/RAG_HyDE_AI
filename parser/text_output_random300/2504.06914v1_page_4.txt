at density ρσ2 = 1.1. (b), (c), (d): Variation of solid order ⟨ψG⟩, hexatic order ⟨ψ6⟩, and defect fraction ⟨δd⟩with Λ; respective
variances are shown in the insets. ⟨(∆ψG)2⟩peaks at Λ = 10.0, ⟨(∆ψ6)2⟩shows a peak at Λ = 15.0. Whereas ⟨(∆δd)2⟩exhibits
two kinks at Λ = 10.2 and 15.0.

Scaling verification via numerical simulations
For this purpose, we analyze the global non-affine pa-
rameter X = N −1 PN
i χi. Its evolution reaches a steady
state for Λ < 10, but diverges for Λ > 10 due to irre-
versible reorganization of particle positions. Examples of
such trajectories of X(t) at Λ = 4 and Λ = 10 are shown
in Fig. 2(a). The steady-state regime is used to test the
scaling hypothesis presented above.
We
now
consider
the
deviation
of
the
global
and steady-state non-affine parameter ∆X(Λ, ρ, T) =
X(Λ, ρ, T) −Xeq(ρ, T) from equilibrium.
Simulations
with N = 4096 ABPs, Λ ∈[0.5, 8.0], ρ ∈[1.0, 1.4], and
˜Dt = 1.0 yield a reasonable data collapse when data from
different densities are plotted as ⟨∆X⟩/aρ versus Λ. The
excess non-affinity shows a scaling form ⟨∆X⟩/aρ ∼Λν
with ν = 2.112 ± 0.006; see Fig. 2(b).
The inset in
Fig. 2(b) shows the density dependence aρ ∼(ρ −ρ0)−1
with ρ0σ2 = 0.971 ± 0.004, surpassing the equilibrium
melting point ρeq
mσ2 = 0.92 [76], reflecting active soften-
ing.
At Λ ≲1, thermal fluctuations dominate over activity,
making the Λ dependence on the non-affine parameter
difficult to discern. To address this, we set ˜Dt = 0 and ex-
plore the range Λ ∈[10−2, 8]. The results (filled symbols
in Fig. 2) collapse onto a single curve across densities, re-
sembling the ˜Dt = 1.0 case. Fitting the power law aρ Λν
gives ν = 2.00 ± 0.01, validating our predicted scaling
for both thermal and athermal systems and confirming
∆X ∼Λ2 across three decades. The density-dependent
prefactor aρ ∼(ρ −ρ0)−1, with ρ0σ2 = 0.947 ± 0.008
(inset of Fig. 2(b) ). Though density scaling remains un-
changed, ρ0σ2 is suppressed in the absence of thermal
noise, as expected.
The above analysis confirms both
scaling forms presented in Eq. (8).
The robustness of
the scaling properties is further verified simulating larger
system sizes in Appendix-B.

Probability distribution of X
In Figure 4, we explore the probability distributions
of the global non-affine parameter X for an ABP solid
at ˜
Dt = 1 and ρσ2 = 1.1. Figure 4a compares P(X)
for N = 4096 particles across different Λ values, showing
that as Λ increases, the mode of the distribution shifts
to larger X (consistent with the ⟨X⟩∼Λ2 scaling) and
broadens with higher activity. This behavior capturing
softening even in the absence of defect formation (as we
show later, the onset of defect formation appears at Λ ≈
10).
As shown in Fig. 4b for Λ = 4 and N ranging
from 1024 to 16384, the probability distribution P(X) is
nearly Gaussian with variance σ2 ∼1/N, consistent with
the central limit theorem for the mean of uncorrelated
entities. Similar scaling behavior for fluctuations in X
was observed before in equilibrium solids [39].

ANALYZING STRUCTURAL INDICATORS
Thus far, we have characterized the softening of a high-
density solid through the non-affine parameter X and its
scaling with the P´eclet number and density. In this sec-
