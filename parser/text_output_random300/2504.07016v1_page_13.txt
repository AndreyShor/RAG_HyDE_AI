where fs(z) = 1 + s δf(z) and δf is an unknown perturbation, |s| ≪1, and l is the radius of
curvature. e corresponds to the line element of other directions which do not play a key role in what
follows. Minimal surfaces Σs of the above metric have an infinite area. However, linearization of the
area with respect to s yields a finite quantity if we impose sufficiently strong decay conditions on
the perturbation δf near the conformal boundary. From a field theory perspective, this corresponds
to focusing on deformations of the quantum state, i.e., no operators have sources that would trigger
a renormalization group flow. Then we can pose the following inverse problem: Given linearized
area data associated to hemispheres that foliate (at least an open subset of) the interior manifold,
and its first and second radial variations, find δf. A natural reference frame for studying this setup
is the spherical coordinate system
x = ρ sin θ cos ϕ,
y = ρ sin θ sin ϕ,
z = ρ cos θ.

Now we choose the radial coordinate ρ instead of z as the embedding function, which we parametrize
in terms of the angles θ, ϕ. The minimal surface solution depends on s, which parametrizes the
family of perturbed metrics, so we denote the solution by ρs = ρs(θ, ϕ).
Moreover, the area
functional itself now explicitly depends on s so we write it as
As[ρs] =
Z
Ls[ρs, ∇ρs],

where Ls is the associated Lagrangian that depends on s. Linearization of the area with respect to
s is

where ρ0 is the hemisphere solution satisfying
ρ0(θ = π

Notice that after differentiating the integrand and applying the chain rule, only the ˙L0 term is
non-vanishing since ρ0 is a minimizer. δA is now a function that takes in a radius r and outputs a
