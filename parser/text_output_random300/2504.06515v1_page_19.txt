As the energy H0 of the two-body system increases, the departure from non-relativistic
motion is quite striking. This is illustrated in Figure 3 for H0 = 25m. We see that the period
of the relativistic motion is only slightly longer than a half-period of its non-relativistic
counterpart. Furthermore, the relativistic system is much more tightly bound, with the
maximal separation approximately half that of the non-relativistic case.
Figure 3. A comparison of the relativistic and non-relativistic trajectories of the neutral particles
of equal mass as a function of their mutual proper time at a large value of the conserved energy
H0. Both motions begin at r = 0 with an initial momentum given by solving (93) (solid line) and its
corresponding counterpart (92) with z = r and µ = m.
