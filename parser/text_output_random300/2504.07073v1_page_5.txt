indicate stars from different evolutionary stages as indicated in the legend. Solid lines and the shaded areas mark the best fit and the uncertainty,
respectively. For the Galactic sample, the central stars of planetary nebulae ([WR]) stars are shown, but since their mass is not known and fixed to
an average mass of 0.6 M⊙they are not included in the fit. Lower: Residuals between the observed mass-loss rates and the best fit. A histogram

data from such systems. Removing these outliers from the fitting
process does not significantly affect the quality of our linear fit,
indicating that the overall power-law trend remains robust.
In the left panel of Fig. 3, where the mass-loss relation for
the Galactic stars is displayed, we also include the positions of
central stars of planetary nebulae ([WR]). These objects exhibit
WR-like spectra but have much lower theoretical mass estimates,
ranging between 0.4M⊙– 0.8M⊙(Tylenda 2003). Despite their
significantly lower wind efficiencies compared to classical WR
stars -— and consequently lower Γe – they still align well with
our derived mass-loss relation. This alignment supports the work
from Toalá et al. (2024) who suggest that the winds in these stars
operate under similar physical principles as those in classical
WR stars. This further supports the capability of our mass-loss
relation in describing the UV-radiation-driven winds of hot stars.
4. Discussion
4.1. Metallicity dependence of radiation-driven winds
Understanding the metallicity dependence of UV-radiation-
driven winds is of major importance for understanding stars
formed in the young Universe. Over the years several stud-
ies focused on deriving the metallicity dependence of OB-
type star winds, yielding values in between m = 0.5 – 1.64,
centering around a value of m ≈0.85 (see Table 1). The
metallicity exponent of m
=
0.86 ± 0.09 derived in this
work aligns well with these previous results. However, a crit-
ical distinction lies in the assumed metallicity of the SMC.
For instance, in this work, we assume that the winds of mas-
sive stars are driven by the iron group elements, which yields
ZSMC, Fe-group = 1/7 Z⊙, Fe-group. In the work of Mokiem et al.
(2007) and Marcolino et al. (2022) only the iron abundance is
considered yielding ZSMC, Fe = 1/5 Z⊙, Fe. If we only consider a
metallicity scaling with iron, our derived metallicity exponent
increases to m = 1.03 ± 0.11. This highlights the sensitivity of
metallicity-dependent wind scaling laws to the adopted metal-
licity of a host galaxy. Hence, when incorporating our mass-loss
relation into stellar evolution codes it is recommended to adjust
the metallicity scaling to the assumed iron-group abundance rel-
ative to the solar value.
For the optically thick winds of WR stars metallicity expo-
nents in the range from m = 0.25 – 1.3, centering – as for OB-
type stars – around m ≈0.85 (see Table 1), are reported. The
metallicity trend of WN-type stars agrees well with our derived
metallicity dependence. However, previous studies focusing on
WC/WO type stars report noticeably lower metallicity exponents
which are out of line with our finding, but approximately agree
with the asymptotic behavior of WR stars in hydrodynamically
consistent calculations (Sander & Vink 2020; Sander 2024). Due
to the constraints of our sample and selection criteria, only very
few WC and WO type stars are included in this work, such that
we cannot investigate whether similar trends for individual WR
subtypes exist in our data.
Recently, Sander & Vink (2020) calculated hydrodynami-
cally consistent stellar atmosphere models for WR stars which
suggest that the metallicity dependence of UV-radiation-driven
winds might not follow a simple power-law relationship. Instead,
their models predict that WR star mass-loss rates sharply de-
cline below the metallicity of the SMC. For OB-star winds, Ku-
dritzki (2002) also found a breakdown of the power-law behavior
