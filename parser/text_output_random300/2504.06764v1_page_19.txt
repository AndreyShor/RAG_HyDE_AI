Figure 4 | Macrospin model of SOT switching in an A-type antiferromagnet. (a) 
Simulated curves of SOT 180° switching of the Néel vector in FCGT of 1 and 9 layers at 
fixed in-plane magnetic fields of ±0.4Han. (b) Magnitude of SOTs to switch the Néel vector 
as a function of in-plane magnetic fields by macrospin simulations. (c) Trajectories of Néel 
vector during the switching by macrospin simulations in FCGT with 1 and 9 layers. The 
colour in trajectory lines indicates the time. (d) Simulated dynamics of out-of-plane Néel 
vector in FCGT with 1 and 9 layers. The in-plane magnetic field of 0.4Han and the critical 
switching SOTs are applied at t = 0. For N = 1, the direction of n is given by m1.
