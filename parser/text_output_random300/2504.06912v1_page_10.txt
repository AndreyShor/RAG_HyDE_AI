Appendix A: Integration in the singular sub-interval
For completeness, we note the specific form of the func-
tional S that enters the modified-residue term used to
compute the bare Raman response.
Specifically, from
the local asymptotic form of s(ω, θ) = 1/
p
ω/2|∆θ| −1
identified in Eq. (8) and for η →0, we need
Sm(ω) =
Z θm
θm−1

ω
2|∆θ| −1
dθ .
(A1)
As argued in the main text, this integration is only
really relevant in the singular sub-interval where ω ∼
2|∆θ|. It is then desirable to remove the modulus sign
by choosing s(ω, θ) = 1/
p
[ω/(2∆θ)]2 −1 and
Sm(ω) =
Z θm
θm−1

s ω

dθ .
(A2)
Since the interval [θm−1, θm) is small, one can perform
the expansion ∆θ = ∆¯θm + vm(θ −¯θm), where vm ≡
∂θ∆¯θm. The above two forms of s(ω, θ) lead to (in the
end-point prescription):
Sm(ω) =

(A3)
where Am = ω/(2|∆¯θm|)−1 and A2,m = [ω/(2∆¯θm)]2−1.
This formally poses a problem near the stationary points
where vm = 0, but the sample points can be chosen to
be misaligned with the stationary points, which takes
care of the numerical ambiguity. However, observe that
if ω ̸= 2|∆θm| then the smallness of θm−θm−1 and/or vm
would render both the above forms to Sm(ω)/s(ω, ¯θm) =
[θm −θm−1]. This demonstrates that irrespective of the
choice of representation of s(ω, θ), the intervals are al-
ways appropriately weighted.
