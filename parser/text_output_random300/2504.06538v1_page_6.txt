not directly interact, a property crucial for tasks requiring
coordination between different limbs or sequential phases.
Mathematically:
(7)
Inv(P i
t ⊗P j
t ) = Inv(P i
t ) · Inv(P j
t ) · Ω(i, j)
The coupling term Ω(i, j) is learned during training but
constrained to satisfy braiding relations that preserve
physical consistency. These braiding relations can be for-
mally expressed as:
(8)
Ω(i, j) · Ω(j, k) · Ω(i, j) = Ω(j, k) · Ω(i, j) · Ω(j, k)
for all triplets of primitives (i, j, k). This condition en-
sures that the coupling terms respect the underlying phys-
ical constraints regardless of the order in which they are
applied.
At the highest level, invariant subspaces in the attention
mechanism correspond to global properties that must be
preserved throughout the action sequence. These invari-
ant subspaces are mathematically represented as projec-
tion operators:
(9)
Πa =
X
α
|ψα
a ⟩⟨ψα
a |
These projectors ensure that the attention mechanism re-
spects the topological sectors of the action space, pre-
venting transitions that would violate global invariants.
The mathematical properties of these projectors, partic-
ularly their idempotence (Π2
a = Πa) and orthogonality
(ΠaΠb = 0 for a ̸= b), guarantee that the resulting action
sequences respect the fundamental physical constraints of
the problem domain.

Implementation and Training
In practice, Mtopo is initialized using physical priors de-
rived from fundamental physical laws and refined dur-
ing training.
To maintain the topological constraints
while allowing adaptation to task-specific requirements,
we project the learned attention patterns onto the mani-
fold of valid topological masks after each update:
(10)
Mtopo ←ΠT (Mtopo + η∇ML)
where ΠT is a projection operator that enforces the
pentagon and hexagon equations, ensuring that the mask
maintains its topological properties throughout training.
Operationally, after each gradient update, we project the
updated attention weights back onto the subspace of “al-
lowed” mask values that preserve fusion-rule consistency.
This step effectively prunes any minor violations intro-
duced by data noise or optimization errors. Concretely,
we solve a small-scale consistency check that verifies
the matrix Mtopocontinues to satisfy the local fusion con-
straints and global invariants (e.g., object continuity, con-
servation of kinematic feasibility). By doing so, we guar-
antee that the final topological mask used at inference
never diverges into physically invalid regimes, even as it
adapts across training epochs.
The mathematical structure of the topological attention
mechanism provides formal guarantees about the physical
validity of the generated action sequences. These guaran-
tees derive from the properties of the underlying topolog-
ical framework and ensure that the model can only gen-
erate physically plausible actions. The hierarchical nature
of the fusion rules allows the model to capture physical
constraints at multiple scales, from local interactions to
global task structure. This multi-scale approach is partic-
ularly effective for complex tasks requiring long-horizon
planning and precise physical interactions.
We extend the flow matching framework by introducing
topological constraints. Given a trajectory from noise to
data distribution:
(11)
q(Aτ
t |At) = N(Aτ
t ; τAt, (1 −τ 2)I)
We train a vector field vθ(Aτ
t , ot) to match the optimal
transport direction u(Aτ
t |At):
Lτ(θ) = Ep(At|ot),q(Aτ
t |At)∥vθ(Aτ
t , ot) −u(Aτ
t |At)∥2
T
(12)
Where ∥·∥2
T is a norm that respects the topological struc-
ture of the action space, encoding invariances present in
the task domain. This is implemented as:
(13)
∥v∥2
T = vT Mtopov

Topological Constraints via Mtopo
The matrix Mtopo serves as the bridge between topologi-
cal field theory and practical robotic control constraints.
This matrix encodes three critical categories of physical
constraints necessary for coherent action generation.
Physical admissibility constraints are encoded through
each entry Mtopo(i, j), which represents whether action
token i can physically precede or coexist with action to-
ken j. For instance, in a robotic manipulation scenario,
a "grasp" action must necessarily precede a "lift" action,
