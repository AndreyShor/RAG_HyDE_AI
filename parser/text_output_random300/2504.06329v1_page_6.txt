APPENDIX
Here we derive the Green function for 1 + 1D Klein–
Gordon equation. The Green function should satisfy
 1
c2 ∂2
t −∂2
x + M2

G(x −x′, t −t′) = δ(x −x′, t −t′)
which can, using the Fourier transformation, be solved
as
G = −1
4π2
¨ +∞
−∞
exp(i(k(x −x′) −ω(t −t′)))
ω2
c2 −k2 −M2
dωdk.
(32)
There are two singular points ω = ±c
√
k2 + M2 on the
integral path k = constant. To avoid them, we should
choose a contour going clockwise over (anti–clockwise un-
der) both poles to give the retarded (advanced) Green
function. Integrate Eq. (32) over ω and replace k with
M sinh η, giving
G± = θ(±(t −t′))
2π
ˆ ∞
−∞
θ(s2) sin(Ms cosh(η))dη.
(33)
Using the integral representation of Bessel function [23],
Eq. (33) yields Eq. (21).
