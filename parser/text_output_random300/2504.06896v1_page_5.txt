where A and B are the factors from the Lagrangian (1) relating the quark and meson ﬁelds and containing the
mixing angles.
The branching fraction of the process calculated using the amplitude given above turns out to be lower than
the experimental data presented in the PDG:
Br(τ →ππηντ)NJL = (0.75 ± 0.11)× 10−3,
(11)
Br(τ →ππηντ)exp = (1.39 ± 0.07)× 10−3 [21]
(12)
The theoretical uncertainty of the NJL model can be estimated approximately at the level of 15%[26, 27].
According to the works [19, 28], the phase factors eiφ with φ = 180◦describing the phase shift between the
ground and ﬁrst radially excited states are of great importance. However, this factor is not described by the
NJL model and can be included on the basis of experimental data by redeﬁning the Breit-Wigner propagator for
excited meson states:
BW p
ρ′ →eiφBW p
ρ′.
(13)
Then the absence of this factor is appropriate for the case φ = 0◦.
While taking into account eiπ, the branching fraction of this process in the NJL model turns out to be higher
than the average value given in the PDG but close to recent BaBar and CMD-3 data
Br(τ →ππηντ)NJL = (1.84 ± 0.27)× 10−3
(φ = 180◦).
Br(τ →ππηντ)BaBar = (1.63 ± 0.08)× 10−3 [19],
Br(τ →ππηντ)CMD−3 = (1.68 ± 0.17)× 10−3 [20].
(14)
The theoretical result obtained with eiπ is in agreement with the experimental data [19, 20] in the framework
of the theoretical and experimental uncertainties. Note that the inclusion of the phase factor previously led to a
noticeable improvement in the results obtained for the processes of τ-decays and e+e−annihilation containing
intermediate channels with radially excited mesons [26].
The structure of the amplitude of the decay τ →ππη′ντ almost coincides with the structure of the amplitude
of the decay τ →ππηντ with the replacement of vertices related to the η meson by the vertices related to the
η′ meson under the integrals.
The experimental limit on the branching fraction of this process is [21]
Br(τ →ππη′ντ)PDG < 1.2 × 10−5.
(15)
The theoretical results in the case φ = 0◦satisfy this constraint
Br(τ →ππη′ντ) = (0.32 ± 0.04)× 10−5
(φ = 0◦).
(16)
However, the use of the phase φ = 180◦leads to exceeding the experimental threshold
Br(τ →ππη′ντ) = (2.45 ± 0.36)× 10−5
(φ = 180◦).

THE DECAY τ →π−2ηντ
The total decay amplitude of τ →π−2ηντ consists of the contributions from the intermediate axial-vector
and pseudoscalar channels in the ground and ﬁrst radially excited states. For these channels, we take into
account a0(980) as the second intermediate state. The total decay amplitude can be written as
M (τ →π−2ηντ) = 64GFVudLµ
