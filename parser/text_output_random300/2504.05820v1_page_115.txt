The Path to aN3LO Parton Distributions
101
Our goal is to determine an approximate expression for the corresponding seven γ(3)
ij (N) N3LO
terms. The information that can be exploited in order to achieve this goal comes from three
different sources: (1) full analytic knowledge of contributions to the anomalous dimensions
proportional to the highest powers of the number of flavors nf; (2) large-x and small-x
resummations provide all-order information on terms that are logarithmically enhanced by
powers of ln(1 −x) and ln x respectively; (3) analytic knowledge of a finite set of integer
moments. We construct an approximation based on this information by first separating off the
analytically known terms (1-2), then expanding the remainder on a set of basis functions and
using the known moments to determine the expansion coefficients. Finally, we vary the set of
basis functions in order to obtain an estimate of the uncertainties.
Schematically, we proceed as follows:
1. We include all terms in the expansion
γ(3)
ij (N) = γ(3,0)
ij
(N) + nfγ(3,1)
ij
(N) + n2
fγ(3,2)
ij
(N) + n3
fγ(3,3)
ij
(N) ,
(4.2)
of the anomalous dimension in powers of nf that are fully or partially known analytically.
We collectively denote such terms as γ(3)
ij,nf (N).
2. We include all terms from large-x and small-x resummation, to the highest known logarith-
mic accuracy, including all known subleading power corrections in both limits. We denote
these terms as γ(3)
ij,N→∞(N) and γ(3)
ij,N→0(N), γ(3)
ij,N→1(N) respectively. Possible double
counting coming from the overlap of these terms with γ(3)
ij,nf (N) is removed.
3. We write the approximate anomalous dimension matrix element γ(3)
ij (N) as the sum of the
terms which are known exactly and a remainder eγ(3)
ij (N) according to
γ(3)
ij (N) = γ(3)
ij,nf (N) + γ(3)
ij,N→∞(N) + γ(3)
ij,N→0(N) + γ(3)
ij,N→1(N) + eγ(3)
ij (N) .

We determine the remainder as a linear combination of a set of nij interpolating functions

with nij equal to the number of known Mellin moments of γ(3)
ij (N). We determine the
coefficients bij
ℓby equating the evaluation of eγ(3)
ij (N) to the known moments of the splitting
functions.
4. In the singlet sector, we take nH = 2 and we make eNij different choices for the two
functions Hij
ℓ(N), by selecting them out of a list of distinct basis functions (see Section 4.1.4
below). Thereby, we obtain eNij expressions for the remainder eγ(3)
ij (N) and accordingly for
the N3LO anomalous dimension matrix element γ(3)
ij (N) through Eq. (4.3). These are used
