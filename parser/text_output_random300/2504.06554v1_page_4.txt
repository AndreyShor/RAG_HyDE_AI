FIG. 3. Error-mitigated variational optimization of a 4-spin circular Ising model (shown in the bottom left inset) with a transverse field
intensity of J = 0.5. Energy minimization is performed using a 3-layer parameterized circuit tailored to the system. The top insets show the
optimization of the variational parameters during the learning process for each layer. At each iteration, the energies of the trial states, measured
under different noise coefficients c = 1 (red) and c = 2.2 (green), are averaged over 20,000 samples. The mitigated energies (blue), derived via
first-order Richardson extrapolation, are fed back into the optimization process to adjust the circuit parameters for subsequent iterations. The
darker and lighter data points represent perturbations in opposite directions within the parameter space throughout the optimization process.

However, due to the dispersive coupling, the photon num-
ber in the storage cavity influences the transition frequencies
in Fig. 2(a). Consequently, during the experiment, we ex-
tend the gate duration to minimize the photon number in the
storage cavity as much as possible, which inevitably increases
the impact of decoherence and reduces the gate fidelity [34].
With the amplitude of Ωf0g1 fixed, T1 and T ∗
2 of the trans-
mon qubit depend on Ωef for different Fock states in the stor-
age cavity, as illustrated in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c), respectively.
We now turn to the evaluation of gate fidelity, as shown in
Fig. 2(d). It has been shown that in 3D superconducting cav-
ity QED systems, gate performance is primarily limited by
incoherent errors arising from the decoherence of the trans-
mon qubit [31, 32]. In particular, when the coherence time of
the transmon qubit is reduced by a factor of 1/c, the gate fi-
delity is expected to degrade by the same factor. The changes
in identity gate fidelity align with the reduction in qubit co-
herence times as Ωef varies. However, a notable reduction in
Hadamard gate fidelity occurs specifically upon activating the
pump Ωf0g1. This reduction could be attributed to the poten-
tial transitions between the transmon qubit and nearby two-
level systems, possibly triggered by the strong multiplexing
pump. Despite this issue, we utilize a parameter of c = 2.2,
where both gate fidelity and coherence time degrade by the
same factor, allowing us to proceed with error mitigation.
We now apply the qubit-efficient VQE approach combined
with the analog error mitigation technique to determine the
ground state energy of an N +1-spin circular Ising model with
a transverse field. In this case, the entanglement is typically
low except near the quantum critical region. Therefore, out-
side of this region, it can be expected that a two-qubit system
is sufficient to capture the essential features of the system,
effectively representing the key dynamics of the model with
minimal computational resources. The Hamiltonian is given
by
H = ∑

where X and Z are Pauli operators, and J is the amplitude of
the transverse field. The spin-spin interaction ZiZj is summed
over nearest-neighbor pairs ⟨ij⟩on a ring formed by the N +1
spins. The quantum circuit, shown in Fig. 1(b), serves as the
ansatz for the VQE algorithm, enabling us to generate a pa-
rameterized quantum state that approximates the ground state
of the system.
