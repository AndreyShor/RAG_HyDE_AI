In Ref. [951], linear power corrections have been computed using renormalon techniques
for the top-quark pair production, in the quark-antiquark partonic channel. It is shown that for
the total cross section, linear power corrections vanish, provided a short-distance scheme is used
for the top-quark mass. In general, the effects computed are relatively small.

t¯t j
LH21 status: NLOQCD corrections calculated for on-shell top quarks [952–954], full off-shell
decays included at NLOQCD [955,956]; NLOEW corrections known [334] for on-shell top quarks;
matching to parton showers [957,958] for on-shell top quarks;
In order to compute NNLOQCD corrections, the last missing piece is the two-loop virtual
amplitude. Therefore, much effort is being focused in this direction. In Ref. [959], two-loop mas-
ter integrals for one of the planar topologies contributing to the process have been presented.
In particular, it is the two-loop five-point pentagon-box integral configuration with one internal
massive propagator. Following this work, the differential equations for the two remaining inte-
gral topologies contributing to the leading colour two-loop amplitudes were also computed [960].
Along the same line, one-loop QCD helicity amplitudes up to O(ϵ2) in the dimensional regular-
isation parameter, which are relevant for the calculation of NNLOQCD corrections, have been
presented [961]. The amplitudes have been expressed in terms of a set of uniformly transcenden-
tal master integrals. Finally in Ref. [962], a numerical evaluation of the two-loop QCD helicity
amplitudes for gg →t¯tg at leading colour has been presented.
In Ref. [963], the one-loop soft anomalous dimension matrices have been presented. It is a
key ingredient for resumming logarithms associated to soft-gluon emissions in t¯t + j production.

t¯t+ ≥2j:
LH21 status: NLOQCD corrections to t¯tjj known for many years [964, 965]; t¯tjjj at NLOQCD
calculated [966].
In Ref. [967], resonant top quarks are considered in the NWA and NLOQCD corrections
have been computed for both the production and the decay part of the process, retaining all
spin information.
3.4.4
t¯t + b¯b
LH21 status: NLOQCD corrections to t¯tb¯b with massless bottom quarks known for off-shell top
quarks [968–970]; NLOQCD corrections for t¯tb¯b production in association with a light jet [971]
for on-shell top quarks;
NLOQCD with massive bottom quarks and matching to a parton shower investigated [972,973]
for on-shell top quarks.
In Ref. [974], NLOQCD predictions for t¯t + b¯b production with b-quark mass effects have
been matched to a t¯t+jets simulation in a variable flavor number scheme. In Ref. [975], NLOQCD
corrections have been matched to parton shower in the five-flavour scheme.
3.4.5
t¯tt¯t
LH21 status: NLOQCD known [976]; NLOEW known [977];
matching of NLOQCD corrections to parton shower known [978].
In Ref. [979], NLOQCD corrections were presented for the four-lepton channel using the
NWA approximation while retaining top-quark spin correlations. NLOQCD corrections are con-
sidered for both the production and decays of the top quarks. The authors conclude that the
