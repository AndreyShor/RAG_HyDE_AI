22 = ρ11 +ρ22 +ρ33=1.
Transit also causes relaxation of the coherences be-
tween the two ground states, as atoms potentially in a
superposition of states |1⟩and |2⟩are replaced by atoms
in a statistical mixture. This leads to the rate equations:

The notation {...}transit denotes the contribution of the
transit in the rate equation. The full rate equation would
include the [H, ρ] commutator, as well as the Lindbladi-
ans. The Rabi frequencies, decoherence and decay rates
in the three-level system are represented in Figure 6(a).
We numerically solve the resulting equations to obtain
ρ13 in a steady state, to deduce χ = N

ε0E . We fit χ
with a polynomial expansion of |E/Es| and obtain χ(3)
as the coefficient of the second-order term. The result is
plotted in Figure 6(b), along with the linear absorption.
Interestingly, optical pumping can also be used to lo-
cally change the atomic population in the two ground
states. Typically, this is done using an arrangement of
two lasers: one on the D2 line (the fluid beam), and one
localized one on the D1 line (the potential beam). The
D1 laser modifies locally the number of atoms visible by
the D2 line laser. This will lead to a local change of re-
fractive index δn(r) and therefore an effective potential
for the fluid of light (Truscott et al., 1999) as shown in
Section II.C. How to use this approach experimentally
will be described in Section VI.B and can be modeled
by the master equations of a four-level system (Aladjidi,
2023).
3. Corrections to the Kerr model
A simple Kerr model with a real linear susceptibility
and a nonlinear susceptibility restricted to a local χ(3)
response does not capture the full picture of alkali va-
pors. Other important mechanisms have to be consid-
ered, which are notably influenced by the effect of atomic
transit discussed previously.
a. Non-locality
A phenomenon in hot atomic vapors that
can significantly modify the effective nonlinearity is non-
locality. Due to atomic motion, the nonlinear response
at a given point in the fluid is not solely determined by
the local density but rather by the density within a char-
acteristic interaction radius. Taking into account a non-
local optical response, the nonlinear term in Eq. (28) is
modified into:
k0
nE
2
n0
Z
S
dr′
⊥G(r⊥−r′
⊥)|E(r′
⊥, z)|2E(r′
⊥, z),
(75)
where G is the non-local response function in real space,
and S is the beam surface. This non-local response has
been observed and identified as a crucial stabilizing factor
in the study of collapse instabilities (Azam et al., 2021).
Two processes compete, the mean distance before atoms
de-excite lb, and the mean distance between atomic col-
lisions lcol. If lb ≤lcol, which is valid until ∼155°C for
87Rb vapors (Skupin et al., 2007), the atomic motion can
be considered ballistic. This model leads to a non-local
kernels in Fourier space:
G(k⊥) =
√π
Γ

(k⊥lb)2
k⊥lb
Erfc

1
k⊥lb

,
(76)
where lb =
1
Γ
q
2kbT
m
∼7.6 µm. Accounting for the ef-
fects induced by non-locality amounts to convolving the
electric field E(r⊥, z) at each z with the function G. In
other terms, non-locality can be understood as a smooth-
ing of the nonlinear interactions. For example, we will
see in Section V.C that this effect is predominant in case
of thermo-optic nonlinearity (Vocke et al., 2016). Impor-
tantly, the presence of non-locality modifies the Bogoli-
ubov dispersion relation as:
ΩB(k⊥) =
s
k2
⊥
2k0
 k2
⊥
2k0
+ k0∆n × G(k⊥)

.
(77)
It is actually possible to exploit this effect to observe
an inflection in the dispersion relation and it has been
predicted that this effect could lead to self-organization
of superfluid light similar to supersolidity (Maucher et al.,
2016).
b. Saturation
At large optical intensity,
the atomic
medium becomes saturated and the nonlinear response is
not of purely χ(3) type (McCormick et al., 2004). A quin-
tic term χ(5), with opposite sign, starts to play a role and
reduces the nonlinearity. This effect (actually accounting
for all higher order terms) is known as saturation. For a
two-level system at resonance, the saturation intensity is
expressed as
Isat(0) = πℏω0Γ
3λ3
,
(78)
where ω0, λ and Γ are respectively the pulsation, the
wavelength and the linewidth of the atomic transition.
For a field detuned by ∆= ω −ω0, the saturation inten-
sity depends on the detuning as Isat(∆) = Isat(0)(1+ ∆2
Γ2 ).
