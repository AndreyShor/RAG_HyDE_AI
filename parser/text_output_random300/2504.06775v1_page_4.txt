cal vibrations. These types of noise are usually modelled
by their impact on qubits; namely, thermal relaxation,
where energy in the qubits dissipates as a result of in-
teraction with the thermal environment, and dephasing,
where the relative phase between quantum states starts
randomising due to external EM fields, slow environmen-
tal changes or noise in the control systems. For these
experiments, we do not consider errors associated with
state preparation or measurement read-out.
As stabiliser codes can only detect and correct combi-
nations of X and Z errors, we only consider X, Y and
Z errors for our noise models, in the form of probabilis-
tic gate noise and depolarising noise. This means that
our noise models are inherently unable to capture the
full range of noise and errors that might arise in physical
NISQ systems. However, since our aim is to evaluate the
effectiveness of the [[4,2,2]] stabiliser code in improving
training outcomes, we only need to simulate noise that
the code is theoretically capable of detecting.
We implement the gate noise model with single-qubit
“error” gates applied after each single-qubit gate, where
there is a probability (or Pauli Error Rate), given by p
(with 0 < p < 1), of either an X, Y or Z error occurring,
and a 1−p chance of no error occurring. Additionally, we
apply each single-qubit error gate after each 2-qubit gate,
on the same qubits targeted by the 2-qubit gates. We also
alter the Pauli Error Rate for 2-qubit gates so that it is
double the error rate used for single-qubit gates, in order
to better model the increased error rate for multi-qubit
gates compared to single-qubit gates.
Our environmental noise model is a highly simplified
model that again consists of X,Y and Z errors. We inject
Pauli errors into the system at regular intervals through-
out the circuit, to each physical and ancilla qubit at the
