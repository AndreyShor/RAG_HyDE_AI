ESM1-5 and CNRM-CM6-1). This large internal variability presents a challenge in extracting the 
forced response from the spatial maps. 
4 Summary and Discussions 
In this study, we investigate the historical evolution of ocean heat uptake efficiency (OHUE), 
defined as the ratio of ocean heat uptake rate to changes in global mean surface temperature 
(GMST), using both observations and CMIP6 model simulations. We observed a relatively low 
OHUE in the late 1980s, a peak around 2000, and a subsequent decline until now. Simulations 
from seven models with large-ensemble simulations generally matched observational OHUE 
variation from in-situ measurements and based on a Green’s Function approach, confirming an 
externally forced response in OHUE. 
One key finding is the significant influence of natural external forcings, particularly volcanic 
eruptions, on the temporal variability in OHUE. Specifically, the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption 
caused a significant decline in OHUE, followed by a recovery period, indicating a lasting volcanic 
effect on ocean heat uptake and its efficiency. The changes in OHUE due to greenhouse gas (GHG) 
and aerosol (AER) forcings are more linear, largely compensating each other, and do not exhibit 
the observed change. Notably, the impact of natural external forcings on OHUE has been largely 
overlooked in previous studies. The long-lasting impacts of volcanic events on OHUE underscore 
the importance of considering natural variability in understanding climate dynamics. 
The substantial increase in global OHUE since the 1980s found in this study confirms previous 
findings based on different methods (Cael, 2022; Watanabe et al., 2013). In this study, we show 
that the observed global OHUE increase from 1988 to 2000 by 0.13 (+25%), 0.11 (+20%), and 
0.23 (+41%) Wm⁻² K⁻¹ from the IAP dataset, Ishii dataset, and GF, respectively. Watanabe et al. 
(2013) used the global energy balance equation to estimate observed ocean heat uptake, given the 
radiative forcing and climate feedback parameters estimated from CMIP5 models. The observed 
OHUE increased from approximately 0.6 W m⁻² K⁻¹ during 1971–2000 to around 2.1 W m⁻² K⁻¹ 
during 1991–2012. This increase (+1.5 W m⁻² K⁻¹) appears somewhat overestimated compared to 
other studies which report a range of 0.5–1.0 W m⁻² K⁻¹ (Kuhlbrodt & Gregory, 2012; Newsom et 
al., 2023). Cael (2022) integrated the GMST rather than calculating the trend of OHC to estimate 
OHUE, assuming that the rate of increase remained constant over the integration period. The 
magnitude of change reported by Cael (2022), +0.83% per year since 1970 with a base value of 
0.48 W m⁻² K⁻¹, is similar to our findings. While the increase in OHUE has been strong during 
certain periods, we show that it has already passed its peak value and is now trending downward. 
This temporal variation is also observed in Sohail et al. (2023; Figure 2f herein), though their focus 
is on the effect of anthropogenic aerosols, without considering the role of natural external forcing. 
The global OHUE derived from observations falls within the range of model results (Figure 1).
