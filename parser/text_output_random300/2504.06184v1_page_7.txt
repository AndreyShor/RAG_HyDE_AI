The amplitudes for Higgs + three partons at NLL accuracy
Since only the antisymmetric octet 8a is exchanged in the t channel, which is odd under
s ↔u crossing, we expect that also the kinematic part of the amplitudes for Higgs + three
partons is odd under s ↔u crossing. Then at next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) accuracy,
we write the amplitude for Higgs + three gluons as [27]
