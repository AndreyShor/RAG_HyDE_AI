To leading accuracy, the Mandelstam invariants (A.6) are reduced to
s12 ≃p+
Hp−
3 ,
s23 ≃−p+
Hp−
3 ,
s13 ≃−p+
3 p−
3 .
(A.13)
Eq. (A.11) implies the hierarchy on the Mandelstam invariants,
s12 ≫−s13 .
(A.14)
Introducing a parameter σ, the hierarchy above is equivalent to the rescaling, s13 = O(σ).

The amplitudes for Higgs + three partons in the HEFT
In the HEFT, where the loop-mediated Higgs-gluon coupling is replaced by an eﬀective
tree-level coupling, the amplitude for Higgs + three gluons, p1p2 →p3H, can be written
as
MH3g(pν1
1 , pν2
2 , pν3
3 , pH) = λ g
2 (F a3)a1a2 mH3g(pν1
1 , pν2
2 , pν3
3 , pH) ,
(B.1)
with λ as in Eq. (2.3), and where colour matrices in the fundamental representation are
normalised as Tr (T aT b) = δab, such that [T a, T b] = (F b)acT c, with (F b)ac = i
√
2f abc. The
tree-level colour-ordered amplitudes are [159]

with spinor products and currents deﬁned in app. A. All of the other colour-ordered am-
plitudes can be obtained by relabelling and by use of reﬂection symmetry, and parity
inversion. Parity inversion ﬂips the helicities of all particles, and it is accomplished by the
substitution, ⟨ij⟩↔[ji].
