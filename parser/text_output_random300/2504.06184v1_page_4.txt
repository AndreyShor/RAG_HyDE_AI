LL accuracy requires jet impact factors, and thus quark or gluon impact factors, at leading
order in αS; for the same amplitude and for the jet cross section at NLL accuracy [15, 17],
jet impact factors at NLO in αS [87, 88] are required. They are based on the one-loop
impact factor [27, 37, 39, 89, 90], and the impact factor for the emission of two gluons or of
a quark-antiquark pair [26, 30, 33, 34, 85, 91], evaluated in NMRK. Likewise, for amplitudes
and for the jet cross sections at NNLL accuracy, jet impact factors at NNLO in αS will
be required. They will be built out of two-loop impact factor [42, 46, 78, 80, 81], one-
loop impact factors for the emission of two gluons or of a quark-antiquark pair, evaluated
in NMRK [92, 93], and the impact factors for the emission of three partons evaluated in
NNMRK [83].
Likewise, the amplitude and the cross section for the production of a Higgs boson in
association with a jet displays the exchange of a gluon ladder in the t channel, which is
convoluted with a jet impact factor and a Higgs impact factor at the ends of the ladder [94–
97]. The coupling of the Higgs boson to the gluons is mediated by a heavy-quark loop [98],
which in the Higgs Eﬀective Field Theory (HEFT) [99–101] may be replaced by an eﬀective
tree-level coupling. In Higgs boson production in association with a jet, the HEFT is a
good approximation of the full theory as long as the jet transverse energies are smaller
than the top-quark mass [102], pT < mt, and larger than the b-quark mass [103], pT > mb,
however the HEFT approximation is quite insensitive to the value of the Higgs–jet invariant
mass [104, 105]. At leading order in αS, the Higgs impact factor is known both in the full
theory with heavy-quark mass dependence [106] and in HEFT. At NLO, the Higgs impact
factor is known only in HEFT [107–109]. It is based on the one-loop Higgs impact factor,
computed in HEFT [107, 108] and the impact factor for the emission of a Higgs and a
gluon evaluated in NMRK, which is known both in the full theory with heavy-quark mass
dependence [106] and in HEFT ∗
In this paper, we consider the HEFT two-loop amplitude for Higgs boson production in
association with a jet, expanded to NNLL accuracy. Thanks to the simpler colour structure
of the amplitudes for Higgs + three partons with respect to parton-parton scattering, we
are able to absorb the cut contributions, which would break Regge factorization, into
single-Reggeon exchange and thus into the impact factor, which we determine at two-
loop accuracy. Accordingly, we are able to predict the single-logarithmic coeﬃcient of the
HEFT three-loop amplitude for Higgs boson production in association with a jet, expanded
to NNLL accuracy.
In sec. 2, we consider the amplitudes for Higgs + three partons in the Regge limit,
at tree-level in sec. 2.1, at NLL accuracy in sec. 2.2 and at NNLL accuracy in sec. 2.3,
where we discuss the issue of the Regge cut in this context. In sec. 3, we consider the
two-loop amplitudes for Higgs + three partons in general kinematics, expand them in the
Regge limit and lay out their infrared structure. Finally, in sec. 4, we present the Higgs
impact factor at two-loop accuracy.
In sec. 5, we draw our conclusions.
The paper is
furnished with four appendices, which display the kinematics of Higgs + three partons, the
∗In the MRK limit of this NMRK, also the leading-order Higgs CEV is known both in the full theory
with heavy-quark mass dependence [106] and in HEFT.
