At the loop level due to interactions with supersymmetric particles, parameters λi acquire
threshold corrections λi = λtree
i
+ ∆λthr
i . Using the renormalization group equations (RGEs),
one can evaluate λi and the corresponding Higgs boson masses at the electroweak scale (MEW)
where they can be measured.
Radiative corrections have a signiﬁcant impact on the model
predictions. A review of diﬀerent methods and approaches for radiative correction calculation
in the MSSM is presented in [27] (see also [28]). In the case where all non-2HDM states are
decoupled, eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT) approach is suﬃcient.
An additional type of corrections comes from nonrenormalizable operators of Higgs potential
decomposition at the loop level. Due to self-interactions, the potential U, (2), acquires inﬁnite
number of terms of dimension six, eight, and etc., Uloop = U(2) + U(4) + U(6) + ... [29] . Within
the MSSM, it was found [30] that the decomposition up to dimension four operators is suﬃcient
if
2|mtopµ| < M2
SUSY,
|mtopA| < M2
SUSY,
(4)
where A = At = Ab, At,b, µ are soft SUSY breaking parameters, mtop is the top quark mass.
These model parameters must also satisfy an approximate ’heuristic’ bound [31] according to
which the deepest minimum of the eﬀective SUSY potential coincides with the EW minimum
max(At,b, µ)
MSUSY
≤3,
(5)
so the condition (4) is always fulﬁlled2.
In the general 2HDM without other new ﬁelds the corrections to U(4+i) (i = 1, 2, ...) may
play an important role to Higgs phenomenology. The case of nonzero U(6) was considered in [33],
where 13 invariant operators of the type κi(Φ†
iΦj)3 were investigated and threshold corrections
to parameters κi were obtained. If the condition (4) is not required then one can explain the
observed excess in the invariant mass of 28 GeV by taking into account the additional threshold
corrections to the dimension six operators [28, 34] .
One must carefully check vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity constraints (see details
in [34, 35]). The conditions for the EW minimum are less constrained, the allowed parameter
space is nearly the same as the one considered for the renormalizable Higgs potential (2) [36].
For correct model predictions, the obtained threshold corrections to κi must also be evaluated
at the EW-scale. RG-improvement of scalar potentials in non-renormalizable theories is discussed
in [37] where it is assumed that divergences are subtracted some way. For potentials similar to our
case – gψ6/6! – there are no RG-analytic expressions and only numeric estimations are possible
[37]. The loop-level Higgs potential in our case has a more diﬃcult structure, so we evaluate
the RG eﬀects to κi by taking into account the RG-dependence of Yukawa and gauge couplings
at the scale MEW3. The dependence of the CP-even Higgs boson mass on the parameter A is
presented in Fig. 1 for mA=200 GeV or mA = MSUSY where κi are evaluated on the scale MSUSY
or mtop. The predictions diﬀer in both cases, and the most noticeable discrepancy is observed
at lower mA.
2Unstable values of At,b, µ, however, are also considered in some analyses [32] .
3The explicit representation for κi and RGEs for hU,D, g1,2 one can ﬁnd in [33, 38].
