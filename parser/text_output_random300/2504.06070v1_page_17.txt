Fluid 2D. In this study, the dataset used consists of image sequences of fluid-driven mass diffu-
sion, generated using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method through COMSOL soft-
ware (Multiphysics, 1998). The physical setup involves an active flow field of width W and height
H, filled with a fluid of density ρ and viscosity coefficient µ. At the left side of the field is the input,
where a material with a diffusion coefficient Dc and concentration c flows and diffuses, driven by
an initial velocity u. The temperature is set to standard conditions, and the pressure is one atmo-
sphere. The data used in the experiments consists only of concentration data. The parameters for
data generation are shown in Figure S4.
This dataset, generated by COMSOL, is used for training and evaluating the model. The training
dataset consists of five subsets, each containing 500 concentration images representing the diffusion
of materials in the fluid. These images form a time series, with each image having a resolution of
640 × 256 pixels. The test dataset is divided into seven subsets, each containing 200 images of the
same resolution, also forming time series data. Differences in physical field parameters across the
subsets are primarily reflected in changes in obstacle positions.
To evaluate the spatial generalization ability of the model, the test set includes three special subsets:
one involves changes in the shape of obstacles, another simulates the removal of an obstacle, and the
third adds a new obstacle to the original physical field. These conditions are absent in the training
data to assess the model’s generalization performance and to determine if it has successfully learned
the underlying physics.
To evaluate the model’s temporal extrapolation ability, we used a strategy during training where the
model predicts the subsequent four frames based on the first four frames. In the testing phase, the
model is tasked with predicting up to 40 frames using the first four frames.
Smoke 2D. Compared to the fluid dataset, the smoke dataset features more complex scenes. We
focus on the process of smoke rising and diffusing in the air, with a square boundary defining the
space. The data was generated using ΦFlow (Holl & Thuerey, 2024), with each image having a
resolution of 256 × 256 pixels, and the location of the smoke source varies between the training and
test sets. The data used in the experiments consists only of concentration data.
Similar to the fluid dataset, we use a strategy where the model predicts the next ten frames based on
the first four frames during the training phase. In the testing phase, the model is required to predict
up to 100 frames using the initial four frames. Different data has varying smoke source location.
