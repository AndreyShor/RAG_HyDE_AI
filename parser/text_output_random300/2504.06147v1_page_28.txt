The subscript k = 0 means that there is no B-field, and so no obstructions to the deformations of
X that produce a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold Xdef. The A-model topological string free energy is
insensitive to complex structure deformations, and so the k = 0 expansion (3.25) is the ‘ordinary’ A-
model free energy for the smooth target manifold Xdef. Knowledge of Xdef and its BPS expansions
is necessary in order to extract the n(g)
β,l, which can only be read off when the full set of F (g)
k ,
0 ≤k ≤⌊N/2⌋is known. For each k, there is a different MUM point to expand about belonging to
a different moduli space. It is quite remarkable that, as shown in [2, 4], integer invariants n(g)
β,k can
be computed by comparing the topological string free energies in expansions about various MUM
points in this manner.
The second Chern number c2 of the singular threefold X, the smooth threefold Xdef, and the
resolution b
X are all equal, since the smoothing/resolution does not affect this quantity. Similarly,
the triple intersection number κ111 is the same for all three spaces. The Euler characteristics differ,
they are related by the formula
χ(Xdef) = χ( b

t in (3.25) is insensitive
to the choice of k. The perturbative genus-0 piece c(N,k)(t) is a cubic polynomial15 in t,

c(N,k) does depend on k, but only through the constant term CN,k which replaces χ/2 in (3.20).
This replacement occurs because in this setup, with singularities supporting fractional B-fields, the
constant map (degree 0) contribution to the A-model free energies differs to the smooth case. In
[4] it is argued that, locally, each singularity together with the supported B-field is modelled by a
noncommutative conifold.
The Donaldson-Thomas partition function for the resolved conifold is ZDT,A±(t, λ), where A± is
either of the two independent resolutions. This depends on the parameter t = b + iv and the string
coupling λ. This t is the complexification of the volume v of the exceptional curve in the resolution.
It is explained in [4] that sending t to zero restores the conifold singularity, but sending v to zero
while b is kept nonzero leads to a situation where the exceptional curve has zero volume but the
string worldsheet physics is regular. As was studied in [62], the volume parameter v can be sent to
15We have included the quadratic term Y011t2, which equalled 0 for the main example in [4].
