Figure 3.21: Left: the 3FNS (intrinsic) valence charm PDF xc−, compared to the 4FNS result (same as
Fig. 3.15 right). The 3FNS also includes MHOU due to the inversion from the 4FNS to the 3FNS. Right:
the pull for valence xc−charm PDF in the 3FNS. Results are shown both for the default fit and also when
including the EMC F c

3.3.3. Charm asymmetries at LHCb and EIC
The LHCb LHC Run 2 data, which, as shown in Section 3.2.4, reinforce the evidence for an
intrinsic total charm component, correspond to measurements of forward Z production in
association with charm-tagged jets [248]. They are presented as a measurement of Rc
j(yZ),
the ratio between c-tagged and untagged jets in bins of the Z-boson rapidity yZ, and they are
obtained from tagging D-mesons from displaced vertices. The higher statistics available first at
Runs 3 and 4 and later at the HL-LHC will enable the reconstruction of the exclusive decays of
D-mesons, and thus the separation of charm and anticharm tagged final states. We thus define
the asymmetry
Ac(yZ) = Nc
j (yZ) −N ¯c
j (yZ)
Nc
j (yZ) + N ¯c
j (yZ) ,
(3.11)
where Nc
j (N ¯c
j ) is defined in the same manner as Rc
j (Eq. (3.5)), but now restricted to events
with D-mesons containing a charm quark (antiquark). This asymmetry is directly sensitive to a
possible difference between the charm and anticharm PDFs in the initial state.
In Fig. 3.22 we display the asymmetry Ac(yZ), Eq. (3.11), computed for √s = 13 TeV using the
PDFs determined here, that allow for a non-vanishing valence component, as well as the default
NNPDF4.0 with c = ¯c. Results are computed using MG5_AMC@NLO [142] at leading order
(LO) matched to PYTHIA8 [256, 259], with the same D-meson tagging and jet-reconstruction
algorithm as in [254, 248]. The leading order parton-level result is also shown.
It is apparent from Fig. 3.22 that, even though the forward-backward asymmetry of the Z decay
generates a small asymmetry Ac ̸= 0 even when c = ¯c [263, 264], the LO effect due to an
asymmetry between c and ¯c PDFs is much larger, and stable upon showering and hadronization
corrections. Indeed, higher-order QCD corrections largely cancel in the ratio Ac(yZ).
