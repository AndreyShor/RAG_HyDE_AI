Introduction
The Sun is the most studied star in the Universe. For decades, it has been observed by numerous
ground-based and space-based instruments, establishing it as a benchmark in stellar physics.
With the advent of helioseismology, the study of solar oscillations, we gained a direct access to
its internal structure (see e.g. Christensen-Dalsgaard 20211 and references therein) and could
use the Sun as a laboratory of fundamental physics. The ﬁeld achieved many breakthroughs:
the location of the base of the solar convective envelope (rcz = 0.713 ± 0.001RSun (hereafter
BCZ),2;3), the determination of its internal rotation (e.g. Couvidat et al. 20034, Howe et al.
20095) and sound speed proﬁles (e.g. Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 1985, 19896;7, Antia & Basu
19948) as well as the helium mass fraction in the solar envelope (Ycz = 0.2485 ± 0.0035,9;10),
inaccessible to surface spectroscopy. The excellent agreement between standard solar models
(SSM) and helioseismic constraints (e.g. Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 199611) also impacted
the resolution of the “solar neutrino problem”.
However, the beginning of the 21st century brought a 25% downward revision of the solar car-
bon, nitrogen and oxygen surface abundances12;13;14;15;16 with respect to Grevesse & Sauval
199817 and 40% with respect to the widely acclaimed solar Model S11. Using the updated
surface abundance values, this previous agreement was signiﬁcantly worsened, rcz and Ycz did
not ﬁt observations anymore and large discrepancies appeared in sound speed. This deﬁned
the “solar modeling problem”, that is actually not limited to the solar case. In stellar mod-
eling, solar abundances deﬁne the “metallicity scale” that relates stellar abundances to solar
ones, so that any change of the solar reference impacts stellar astrophysics globally. The so-
lar problem is still extensively studied today (see e.g. Serenelli et al. 200918, Song et al.
201819 and Zhang et al. 201920 and references therein, and Basu 201621 for a review), as it
impacts the ingredients entering stellar evolution computations such as, amongst others, the
