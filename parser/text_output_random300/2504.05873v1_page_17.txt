Figure 6: Resonant ALP production through the process e−e+ →a.
The first delta distribution in eq. (3.15) is equivalent to the condition s = m2
a. After insert-
ing this cross section into eq. (3.6), the two delta distributions cancel out the integrations,

Here, E∗and la∗are the positron energy and decay length, respectively, after applying
the conditions given by the two delta distributions in eq. (3.15). The mass range in which
resonant production can be detected is bounded from below by the fact that the ALP
must have an energy larger than the cutoff energy of the detector and from above by the
maximum possible positron energy, i.e.
Ea = E + me = m2

This means resonantly produced ALPs can only be detected when the ALP mass is in the
interval √2meEcut < ma <

2me(E0 + me).
In addition to the resonant production discussed above, electron-positron annihila-
tion can also proceed non-resonantly. The corresponding cross sections are discussed in
appendix B.2.

ALP Yields in NA64
While eq. (3.6) holds for E137 and the visible mode setup of NA64, there are some relevant
changes when calculating the expected yield of ALPs for the invisible setup as well as the
muon setup of NA64.
NA64 in invisible mode
Since the invisible setup of NA64 is an active beam dump that measures the missing energy
of an event instead of detecting particles downstream of the dump, one can consider the
decay volume to be infinitely large, i.e. one can set Ldec →∞. This simplifies the equation
