Introduction 
Health disparities (HDs) are differences in the burden of disease experienced by different 
groups within a population.1 They have been tied to variation in social conditions over the course 
of a lifetime also known as social determinants of health (SDOH).2,3 The United States Department 
of Health and Human Services has outlined five domains of SDOH, incorporating health care 
access and quality, built environment, social and community context, economics, and education at 
both the individual and structural level. The National Health Service in the United Kingdom 
outlines the relevant domains as protected characteristics, socioeconomic deprivation, social 
vulnerability, and geography.6 SDOH variables include economic stability, educational access, 
social cohesion, neighborhood-level racial segregation, and health care access. Distinctive clusters 
of these non-medical factors can be considered SDOH phenotypes.7 There is evidence that in the 
United States, SDOH accounts for a substantial proportion (47%) of health outcomes at the county 
level, even more than health behaviors (34%), clinical care (16%), or physical environment (3%).8 
Using SDOH to study population-level health disparities can have a substantial impact for health 
outcomes, contributing to targeted interventions and advocacy.9  
Many measures of health for HD studies are currently collected from numerical or text-based 
information in EHRs, such as laboratory results or natural language processing of provider notes, 
such as is done for diabetes10 or patient adherence to medication.11 Aggregations of these clinical 
data has been shown to correlate to disease and be studied in the context of SDOH to identify 
population-level HDs and address them, including studying patient concerns and challenges,12–14 
and tailoring interventions.15–17 Recent advances have led to genomic data also being used to 
identify SDOH phenotypes (such as for accelerated aging18).
