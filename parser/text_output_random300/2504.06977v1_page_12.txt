FIG. 10. Simulated spectral broadening versus the number of nearest KRb molecules in the Monte Carlo model. Blue: 1-σ
confidence interval of the measured broadening. Orange: 1-σ confidence interval of the simulated Rydberg spectrum’s FWHM
as a function of the number of included KRb molecules (n = 1 to 10). FWHM are extracted from fitting a Lorentzian curve to
measured and calculated spectra.
of the experimental cycles by initializing molecules and atoms according to a 3-dimensional normal distribution set by
the cloud dimensions directly measured in the experiment (Rb : (σx = 7.3±0.25, σy = 53.2, ±4.3, σz = 7.3±0.25) µm;
KRb : (σx = 6.0 ± 0.34, σy = 36.3 ± 1.7, σz = 6.0 ± 0.34) µm). For each cycle, we randomly picked one Rb atom
from the cloud to be driven to the Rydberg state with a Rabi-rate accounting for the finite beam diameters of 60
µm and 55 µm for the 1011 nm and 420 nm drive, respectively. The drive was simulated in the presence of dynamics
of the Rydberg atom interacting with its 10 nearest KRb molecules. The Rydberg population from each cycle was
extracted by taking the observation value of the density matrix, and it was averaged over 512 repetitions for a given
set of experimental parameters.
