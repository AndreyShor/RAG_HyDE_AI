Figure 2. Maximal possible final fidelity F as a function of the total protocol time T for three
different experimental limitations set on external strength g. The lowest bound of the fidelity
is presented by the bottom horizontal dashed line. The vertical dashed red line indicates the
estimated quantum speed limit time TQSL. In all plots, time is measured in units ¯h/∆.
the limit of previously discussed limiting time TL when the desired final fidelity approaches
1. It is clear that for all three scenarios obtaining the target state |tar⟩with high fidelity is
possible. However, stronger limitations put on the range of accessible values of the control
parameter lead to an evident increase in the minimum propagation time. In particular,
when the requested target state is defined for an interaction of opposite sign, a meaningful
improvement of the final fidelity from its lower bound requires a significantly long protocol.
However, the simple fact that it is possible to arrive at a strongly repulsive ground state
using only weak non-positive interactions is appealing. Similar conclusions can be obtained
for arbitrary values of g2 and the range [gA, gB]. In general, for a given g1 and fixed range
[gA, gB] a limiting TQSL increases with g2.
4. Mixture of three fermions
To illustrate the method for quantum systems having larger Hilbert spaces, let us now
consider a two-component mixture of three interacting ultracold fermions confined in a
one-dimensional harmonic trap of a given frequency ω. We assume the simplest possible
scenario in which fermions belonging to different components interact only via zero-range
forces while intra-component interactions are not present.
