from the feedback loop triggers initial transitions. The signal from these spontaneous transitions
is amplified by the feedback loop and the phase is tuned for positive reinforcement. The resulting
amplified field (𝐵ext = 𝐺ext𝐵OPM) drives the transitions, pushing the population imbalance away
from the SABRE-pumped hyperpolarized steady state (30). With high enough external feedback
gain, this SABRE-pumped population imbalance can be temporarily inverted (see Fig. S4). De-
viations from the hyperpolarized steady state manifest experimentally as transient bursts. Such
bursts represent the so called “overshooting,” where the feedback-amplified transition intensities
rise beyond sustainable levels (28,31). The SABRE pumping and nuclear spin relaxation processes
oppose the feedback amplification, dampening coherences and partially restoring the hyperpolar-
ized steady state. Over successive faded bursts, the system stabilizes into what we call the “dynamic
steady state” under the feedback, in which the combined effects of SABRE-pumping (replenishing
population imbalances), the feedback-amplified transitions (driven by 𝐵ext), and relaxation come
into a balance.
The quantum oscillator operating on the molecular 𝐽-transition was continuously recorded for
over 3000 s. Fourier transformation (FT) (Fig. 1E) revealed a sharp, delta-function-like peak with a
full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 337 𝜇Hz (Fig. 1E, inset). This linewidth is approximately
the inverse of the measurement time, indicating minimal frequency drift of the experimentally
observed quantum oscillation. Consequently, the linewidth of such stable quantum oscillations
scales inversely with measurement duration, suggesting prolonged measurements may yield even
narrower FWHM. In contrast, the linewidth obtained from conventional zero-field NMR spectra
does not improve with increased measurement time, as it is fundamentally limited by nuclear spin
relaxation. For instance, the [15N]-ACN has a FWHM of 37 mHz for the same transition (Fig. 1H).
Similarly to high-field rasers (14), the reduced linewidth achieved with the 𝐽-oscillators facilitates
resolving overlapping resonance lines.

For a negative external feedback gain (𝐺ext = −20, Fig. 2C), the 1-𝐽quantum oscillator is sustained
for feedback delays ranging from 60 to 274 ms (minimal delay in our system is 60 ms). Under
the same negative feedback gain conditions, the 2-𝐽quantum oscillator emerges only within a
