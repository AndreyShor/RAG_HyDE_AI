Fig. S10. The formation of 2-Amp(1+) cation in aqueous solution studied by Raman 
spectroscopy (780 nm laser excitation). The particular spectra represent systems prepared by 
mixing of 2-aminopyrimidine solution with hydrochloric acid in the following molar ratios 
(base to acid) - i.e. 1:0 (spectrum 1), 1:0.125 (spectrum 2), 1:0.250 (spectrum 3), 1:0.375 
(spectrum 4), 1:0.500 (spectrum 5), 1:0.625 (spectrum 6), 1:0.750 (spectrum 7), 1:0.875 
(spectrum 8) and 1:1 (spectrum 9). 
 
 
The formation of 2-Amp(1+) cation in aqueous solution was studied by Raman spectroscopy 
(Raman titration) using 780 nm laser excitation. The studied solutions were prepared by mixing 
of 1 mol/l solution of 2-aminopyrimidine with 4 mol/l solution of hydrochloric acid in the molar 
ratios (base to acid) ranging from 1:0 to 1:1. The resulting spectra are presented in Fig. S10. 
The formation of 2-Amp(1+) cation is clearly demonstrated by the appearance of new Raman 
bands at ~1550 cm-1, ~1300 cm-1, ~640 cm-1 and ~580 cm-1.  
 
The crystallization of equimolar 2-aminopyrimidine solution with hydrochloric acid led to 
the formation of the only product 2-AmpCl½H2O – see Table S23 and Fig. S9, Supplementary 
material.
