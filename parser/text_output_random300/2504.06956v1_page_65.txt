From this point, it suffices to follow the proof of [Mad15, Lemma 5.1] to conclude.
7.2.4
A renewal result
Combining Lemmas 7.5, 7.6, 7.8, and 7.9, we have shown in the previous subsection that for any
λ > 0 and ε > 0, there exist 0 ≤A < L sufficiently large such that there exists b0 > 0 and s0 > 0
sufficiently large, such that for any s ≥s0 satisfying (es + 1)/(R + 1) ∈N and any b ≥b0, there
exists a sufficiently large T ≥0 such that for all t ≥T and any function χ : [0, R]d →R satisfying
the conditions in (6.6), it holds that

Therefore, in what follows, we fix λ > 0 and A, L, b ≥0, and we study the quantity E(7.22). Given a
function g : Rd →R, we introduce the fields Υb and Υb,g on Rd by letting
Υb(x)
def= Yb(e−bx) −Yb(0) ,
Υb,g(x)
def= Υb(x) + g(x) .

Lemma 7.10. For any λ > 0 and A, L, b ≥0, consider the function Fλ
A,L,b : R × C(Rd) →R
defined in (7.29). Then, there exist two functions h : R →R+ and F∗: C(Rd) →R+, possibly
depending on the parameters λ, A, L, b, such that:
6As we mentioned in Remark 7.7, the reason we included the indicator function of the event {Mm,bt+1,bt −dt < −A}
is due to a technical reason. Indeed, without this indicator function, we would not be able to bound the integral by one. It is
not difficult to construct a “pathological example” for a possible realisation of the field Yt for which the integral becomes
arbitrarily large.
