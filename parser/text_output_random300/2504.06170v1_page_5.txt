Physical processes in the IRDC hosting N59-North

cluding ATL-2) exhibits velocity variations compared
to its surrounding areas. This suggests that the mas-
sive stars responsible for the bubble N59-North might
have influenced the morphology and gas kinematics in
the filament. This aspect is explored in detail in Sec-
tion 3.3.2. The study by Chen et al. (2024) identified
H ii regions driven by massive OB-type stars within the
filament hosting the N59-North bubble (see Figure 1 in
their work). Therefore, this filament can also be exam-
ined in the context of the escape and confinement of
ionizing radiation from massive stars forming within it
(e.g., Whitworth & Priestley 2021).
3.3.2. Position-velocity and position-position-velocity
diagrams using 13CO(J = 1–0) and 13CO(J = 3–2)
data
To reveal the kinematics of the dense gas, we produced
the Galactic longitude-velocity (i.e., l-v or position-
velocity (PV)) diagram using the 13CO(J = 3–2) data,
which is shown in Figure 4a. The white arrows in Fig-
ure 4a represent the velocity gradients identified in the
PV diagram toward the eastern and western parts of
the filament. We have estimated these gradients to be
about −0.32 and 0.36 km s−1 pc−1, respectively. In the
case of the l-v diagram, the integration range in Galactic
latitude is too large (i.e., [−0.◦046, 0.◦059]) to properly
reveal the gas kinematics toward the bubble N59-North.
Therefore, we performed the spectral decomposition of
the 13CO(J = 3–2) data using the Python-based tool
SCOUSEPY (Henshaw et al. 2016, 2019).
The process
began by defining the size of the ‘Spectral Averaging
Areas (SAA)’ in pixels, with a selected size of 3 × 3
pixel2. These SAAs are spatially distributed to cover all
emission above a specific threshold (∼1.5 K). From each
of these SAAs, an averaged spectrum was extracted and
fitted with single or multiple Gaussian components. The
best-fit parameters from the SAA-averaged spectra were
then utilized to fit the spectra at each pixel in the SAA.
To visualize the results, the centroid velocity/velocities
of the fitted Gaussian(s) is/are plotted for each pixel in
position-position-velocity (PPV; here, l-b-v) space. The
resulting PPV diagram from our analysis is shown in
Figure 4b, where the moment-0 map of the filament is
displayed using filled contours in the l-b plane. The PPV
map is consistent with the PV diagram, revealing oppo-
site velocity gradients toward the eastern and western
parts of the filament.
Notably, the PPV map clearly
highlights the red- and blue-shifted gas components to-
ward the bubble N59-North (see the arrows).
3.4. Star fomation activities in the filamentary cloud
Figures 5a, 5b, 5c, and 5d present overlays of the
locations of the ATLASGAL clumps and the 13CO(J
= 3–2) emission contour at about 3.7 K km s−1 (i.e.,
∼10σ) on four different maps: the Spitzer 8.0 µm im-
age, the MeerKAT 1.3 GHz continuum emission map,
the Herschel H2 column density map, and the Herschel
dust temperature map, respectively. These maps help
us to identify the presence of dense molecular gas, dust
clumps, ionized emission, cold dust, warm dust, and col-
umn density toward the filamentary cloud. The filamen-
tary cloud is linked to material exhibiting column densi-
ties exceeding 2.25 × 1022 cm−2, and is assoicated with
warm dust (Td = 20.5–24 K) as well as relatively cold
dust emission (Td = 17–18.5 K). All the ATLASGAL
clumps are seen toward the areas where column densities
exceed 3.2 × 1022 cm−2. The radio continuum emission
map reveals the association of extended ionized regions
with the filamentary cloud, where the presence of warm
dust emission is evident. In the filamentary cloud, dust
emission at Td = 17–18.5 K is traced in regions within
the longitude range of [33.◦25–33.◦40].
The detection of YSOs within a molecular cloud pro-
vides as direct evidence of ongoing star formation. The
IR excess observed in YSOs arises from their envelopes
and dusty circumstellar disks (Sharma et al. 2017; Kuhn
et al. 2021). To analyze the distribution of YSOs within
the filamentary structure hosting N59-North (outlined
by the magenta dot-dashed lines in Figure 1a), we used
the SPICY catalog by Kuhn et al. (2021). In the Spitzer
8.0 µm image, the positions of Class I, Flat Spectrum,
and Class II YSOs from the catalog are highlighed by
red, cyan, and green diamonds, respectively (see Fig-
ure 5a). Using the color conditions [4.5] −[5.8] ≥0.7
and [3.6] −[4.5] ≥0.7 (Getman et al. 2007), we have
also identified additional Class I YSO candidates, repre-
sented by blue diamonds in Figure 5a. These YSOs are
distinct from those reported in Kuhn et al. (2021). Over-
all, numerous YSO candidates are detected within the
13CO(J = 3–2) moment-0 contour, indicating the asso-
ciation of higher-density gas with ongoing star-forming
activity.
4. DISCUSSION
Through a comprehensive multi-wavelength obser-
vational investigation, we have gained new insights
into the MSF activity toward the bubble N59-North.
Our findings include the identification of an extended
IRDC/filamentary structure that exhibits significant ve-
locity variation along its length. Additionally, we have
revealed several dust clumps as potential candidates for
MSF and identified a C-HFS. These results are discussed
in this section to infer the ongoing physical processes re-
lated to the origin, evolution, and MSF activity of the
IRDC hosting the bubble N59-North.
