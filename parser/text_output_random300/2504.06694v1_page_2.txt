COMPARISON OF FROBENIUS ALGEBRA STRUCTURES ON CALABI–YAU TORIC HYPERSURFACES
2
To proceed and ﬁnd a promising direction to pursue, let us revisit the case of an isolated singularity.
Suppose f is a homogeneous polynomial of degree r that deﬁnes a smooth Calabi–Yau hypersurface Xf
embedded in the projective space Pr−1, yielding a compact K¨ahler manifold X := Xf(C) of dimension
r −2. According to Griﬃth’s theorem [9], there is a C-vector space isomorphism2
φ :
∞
M
a=0
R(f)ar ∼= Hr−2
pr (X)
(1.1)
where R(f)k =
C[z]k
J(f) ∩C[z]k
is the homogeneous component of R(f) of degree k and Hr−2
pr (X) =
Hr−2
pr (X, C) is the primitive middle-dimensional cohomology of X with the coeﬃcient C. Moreover, if we
consider the Hodge decomposition Hr−2
pr (X) ∼= Lr−2
a=0 Hr−2−a,a
pr
(X), then φ maps R(f)ar to Hr−2−a,a
pr
(X)
for each a. This is compatible with the Macaulay theorem [13] that R(f)ar = 0 for a ≥r −1.
In fact, we can choose a C-vector space isomorphism φ so that it preserves additional structures. Specif-
ically, there exists a trace map Tr: R(f)(r−2)r ∼= C corresponding to the integration map
R
X : Hr−2,r−2
pr
(X) ∼=

whenever a + b = r −2 (see the proof of Proposition 2.8 given at the end of Subsection 3.2 for details
for where the sign (−1)b comes from).
Note that the bilinear map mul is symmetric (respectively,
skew-symmetric) if r −2 is even (respectively, r −2 is odd).
Let us denote the sub-algebra L∞
a=0 R(f)ar of R(f) by
A(f) :=
∞
M
a=0
R(f)ar
and the above symmetric bilinear pairing (by declaring ⟨u, v⟩= 0 for u ∈R(f)ar, v ∈R(f)br unless
a + b = r −2) by
⟨−, −⟩: A(f) × A(f) →C.
The bilinear pairing extends to a symmetric bilinear pairing ⟨−, −⟩: R(f) × R(f) →C given by ⟨u, v⟩=
Tr(u · v); we still have ⟨u, v⟩= 0 unless deg u + deg v = (r −2)r. Then the triple (R(f), ·, ⟨−, −⟩) is
a Frobenius algebra and (A(f), ·, ⟨−, −⟩) is its Frobenius subalgebra. As the aforementioned theory of
K. Saito promotes the Frobenius algebra (R(f), ·, ⟨−, −⟩) to a Frobenius manifold structure on R(f), it
restricts to (A(f), ·, ⟨−, −⟩) and provides a formal Frobenius manifold structure on A(f) as well.
The goal of this article is to identify a class of polynomial functions f on Cr for which the critical
locus Crit(f) may be non-isolated and non-compact in Cr, yet the following are satisﬁed:
(1) there exists a ﬁnite-dimensional C-vector subspace A(f) ⊂R(f) that is equipped with a Frobe-
nius algebra structure;
(2) there exists a formal non-trivial Frobenius manifold structure on A(f) that extends the Frobenius
algebra A(f).
In the rest of the introduction, we sketch our approach. Our setup begins with an m-dimensional sim-
plicial Gorenstein toric Fano variety P whose toric homogeneous coordinate ring is C[z] = C[z1, · · · , zr].
Thus P is a complete normal orbifold whose anti-canonical divisor is Cartier and ample.3
Suppose
f ∈C[z] deﬁnes a smooth ample Calabi–Yau hypersurface Xf in P and a compact K¨ahler manifold
X := Xf(C). In this case, the coordinate ring C[z] is graded by the class group of P. As we write
2Without Calabi–Yau condition, one still has the following isomorphism
φ :

(X).
3These assumptions on P are crucial in using the Batyrev–Cox theorem [3, Theorem 10.13]; see Theorem 2.5.
