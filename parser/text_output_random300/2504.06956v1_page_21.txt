Remark 4.7. For each b âˆˆN, j âˆˆ[b âˆ’1]0, and l âˆˆ[j]0, recalling (4.1), we have, for all x âˆˆBl,
Î¥b,g(x) âˆ’Î¥j,g(x) = âˆ’
Z b
j
(1 âˆ’K(eâˆ’sx))dBs + Zj,b(x) .
Now, on the event {Kb â‰¤j}, one has
sup
xâˆˆBl
|Zj,b(x)| â‰²eâˆ’(jâˆ’l)/2(log j)2 ,
as well as

eâˆ’iÎ˜j(i + j) â‰²eâˆ’(jâˆ’l)(log j)2 .
Therefore, combining the previous two bounds, we obtain that for all l âˆˆ[j]0, on the event {Kb â‰¤j},
it holds that
sup
xâˆˆBl
|Î¥b,g(x) âˆ’Î¥j,g(x)| â‰²eâˆ’(jâˆ’l)/2(log j)2 .
(4.9)
Thanks to Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4, we have the following result concerning the tail behaviour of the
control variables.
Lemma 4.8. There exists a constant c > 0 and k0 âˆˆN such that for b âˆˆN with b > k0, and
u âˆˆ[b1/4, b3/4],
P0,u,b(Kb = k) â‰¤eâˆ’c(log k)2 ,
âˆ€k âˆˆ{k0, . . . , b} .
(4.10)
Similarly, there exists a constant ec > 0 and ek0 âˆˆN such that
P(Kâˆž= k) â‰¤eâˆ’ec(log k)2 ,
âˆ€k â‰¥ek0 .
(4.11)
Proof. We start with (4.10). Fix b âˆˆN, u âˆˆ[b1/4, b3/4], and let k âˆˆ[b]. By Definition 4.6, the event
{Kb = k} is contained in the union of the following events,

The conclusion then follows since there exists constants c1, c2 > 0 such that the probabilities of the
events appearing in the unions of the above display are bounded either by c1 exp(âˆ’c2Î˜kâˆ’1(j)2) (for
the ones on the first line) or by c1 exp(âˆ’c2Î˜kâˆ’1(j)) (for the ones on the second line). Summing over
j then yields the desired bound.
Indeed, for the events in the union on the top-left, this follows since for all u âˆˆ[b1/4, b3/4], the
oscillation norms Oscj(B) have Gaussian tails uniformly over the probability laws P0,u,b, for all
j âˆˆ[b âˆ’1]0. For the event in the union on the top-right this follows from (G2). Finally, regarding the
events in the union on the bottom-left and bottom-right, this follows by Lemma 4.3 and Lemma 4.4,
respectively. To conclude, we note that the proof of (4.11) proceeds in the same exact way.
We are now ready to state and prove the following key lemma. For a diagrammatic representation
related to this lemma, we refer to Figure 1.
