Randomly selecting a node and assigning it a wealth of 1 is represented as an 
𝑛-row column vector 𝒗0, with only one element being 1 and the rest being 0. By 
repeating the product of the propagation matrix 𝑷 with 𝒗0 for a number of steps 𝜏, 
the column vector 𝒗𝜏 after the propagation of wealth can be obtained as in Eq (10). 
The elements of 𝒗𝜏 represent the distribution of wealth for all nodes. 
 
𝒗𝜏= 𝑷𝜏∙𝒗0

The Gini coefficient is a well-known index for evaluating the degree of 
inequality in the distribution of wealth [30] and is calculated by drawing the Lorenz 
curve and the equal distribution line [31]. Various indices can be calculated from the 
Lorenz curve; however, we used the Gini coefficient, which is the most common. 
 By operating on Eq (11), the elements 𝑣𝜏𝑖 of 𝒗𝜏 at step 𝜏 are sorted from 
smallest to largest, and the 𝑗-th wealth from smallest is taken as 𝑢𝜏𝑗, and the Gini 
coefficient 𝐺 is calculated using Eq (12). If wealth is distributed evenly, 𝐺 is 0; if in a 
delta distribution (all wealth is concentrated in just one node), 𝐺 is 1. In other words, 
the greater the inequality, the larger the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient for 𝒗0 is 
1.

First, we set the parameters that are common to four-mode network models.
