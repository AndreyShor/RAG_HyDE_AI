In order to ﬁnd out the hi-alignment limit conditions (i = 1, 2, 3), we analyze the following
forms of Higgs interactions with up and down SM fermions and gauge bosons [6, 42]
g(hiuu)
=
(sαa2i + cαa1i −icβa3iγ5)/sβ,
g(hidd)
=
(cαa2i −sαa1i −isβa3iγ5)/cβ,
g(hiV V )
=
cβ−αa2i + sβ−αa1i.

Then the Higgs alignment limit conditions can be presented as
h1 :
(I) β −α ≃π/2, c1 ≃0;
(II) tan(β −α) ≃−c2/c1, mh1 ≃mH;
(11a)
h2 :
(I) α ≃0, β ≃0, c2 ≃0,
(II) tan(β −α) ≃−c2/c1, mh2 ≃mh;
(11b)
h3 :
(I) α ≃0,
β ≃0, mh3 ≃mH;
(II) β −α ≃π/2,
mh3 ≃mh,
(11c)
where for each hi-alignment two diﬀerent sets of conditions are possible.
The hI
1-alignment
limit4, (11a), resembles the one in the model with CPC added by relation c1 ≃0 which ﬁxes the
CP-violating phase as solutions of equation ac2
ϕ + bcϕ + c ≃0, where

In the limit κi=0 the phase is deﬁned by
cos ϕ = |λ6|sαcβ −|λ7|cαsβ
|λ5|cα+β
.

Alignments hI
2 and hI
3 are valid for cos(β −α) = 1 and as far as the only point where α and
β are close to each other is 0, we end up with conditions α ≃0, β ≃0. The choice of tan β ≃0
is not relevant for phenomenology as it leads to a massless b quark, so we rule out the hI
2 and
hI
3 alignments.
The last hII
1 , hII
2 and hII
3 alignments can be realized with Higgs boson masses of the EW-scale
mhi ∼MEW. Taking into account the current experimental bounds for searching Higgs neutral
scalars [4], the alignment limits with mhi ∼MEW for tan β ≥10 are excluded. For the case
of tan β ≤10 the situation is more unambiguous as far as we do not know the experimental
constraints on the neutral Higgs bosons in this region. Numerical estimations performed for
ﬁxed parameters
tan β = {2, 7},
MSUSY = {2.5, 5} TeV,
mA = {96, 125} GeV
