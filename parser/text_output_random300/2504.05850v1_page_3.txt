Upon integration, such an edge will contract.
The transition from Qν;α to Qα

The left-hand side of (11) may be considered as a mixed numerator differential propagator Qα
ν+1/2λ;β.
Solving (11) for the last term on the right-hand side lowers the number of upper indices. This gives rise
to a bootstrap algorithm for the conversion from numerator form to differential form. We arrange all
spin k −2j, j = 0, 1, . . . , ⌊k/2⌋propagators built from subsets of indices in α into a vectors Qk
ν and Qν,k
for numerator and differential forms, respectively. Then, the transformation matrix T k

between the vectors Qk
ν and Qν,k is triangular (for a suitable arrangement of the entries). The diagonal
entries of T k
ν are (−2)k−2jΓ(λν + k/2 −j)/Γ(λν −k/2 + j) for j = 0, . . . , ⌊k/2⌋.
Example 1. For k = 0, we trivially have T 0
ν = (1). For k = 1 (see k = 0 in (11)), we have Qν;α1(x, y) =
(−2λν + 1)Qα1
ν (x, y), yielding T 1
ν = (−2λν + 1). For k = 2 we have

Let 0 be the origin in RD and let ˆz1 be a fixed, constant unit vector, ∥ˆz1∥= 1. We obtain Qα

to define Qν;α(x, 0) = (−1)|α|Qν;α(0, x) and Qν;α(x, ˆz1) = (−1)|α|Qν;α(ˆz1, x).
For the definition of
Qν;α(0, ˆz1) = (−1)|α|Qν;α(ˆz1, 0) we use the transition matrix T k
ν . In general, both propagators depend
on ν.
Example 2. From Example 1 we obtain Qν;α1(0, ˆz1) = (−2λν + 1)ˆzα1

3. Feynman integrals
Consider an oriented graph G whose edges are labeled by the same indices as the propagators (weight
and spin). Let V ext
G
be a set of external vertices z0, z1, . . . , z|V ext
G
|−1 and V int
G
be a set of internal vertices
x1, . . . , x|V int
G |. We define the Feynman integral AG(z0, . . . , z|V ext
G
|−1) as the integral

Qxy(x, y),
where the product is over all edges e = xy ∈EG. For each edge we have Qe = Qαe
νe for an edge in
numerator form and Qe = Qνe;αe for an edge in differential form. We assume that G is such that the
integral exists. Typically, on the right-hand side some (or all) indices are contracted, so that the indices
of the propagators form a larger set than α.
The scaling weight of the graph G in D = 2λ + 2 dimensions is the superficial degree of divergence

The existence of (13) only depends on the scaling weights of G and its subgraphs, so that we can refer
to spin zero, Proposition 11 in [2], for convergence.
