which is the determining equation of the Hamiltonian.
Note that K± must both be real in order for the Hamiltonian (76) to have a deﬁnite
meaning. This imposes a restriction on X corresponding to a value of the effective cos-
mological constant Λe. But K0 is not necessarily real; indeed, for a sufﬁciently strong
electromagnetic repulsion (sufﬁciently large positive e1e2), K0 will be imaginary. In this
case, in the (0) region, the solution for ϕ becomes

instead of (78). Indeed (81) and (79) can, respectively, be obtained from (78) and (73) by
formally replacing K0 with i ˜K0.
Consequently, (77) is applicable for all values of K0. This transcendental equation
determines H in terms of the momenta and positions of the particles. Although (77) cannot
