SOLUTION OF THE SELF-CONSISTENT
EQUATIONS FOR W
We adopted an iterative procedure to solve the
self-consistent relation for W of eq. (10) the main
text, which we rewrite here more conveniently as:
W(E) =
P′
j
nj(E)
gj

1−W (E)
Zj

P′
k
Nk
Zkgk

1−W (E)
Zk
 =
P′
j
nj(E) Zj
gj(Zj−W (E))
P′
k
Nk
gk(Zk−W (E))
,
(S1)
where:
Zj =
X
Emin(j)≤E≤Emax(j)
W(E) ,
(S2)
and the W array is subject to the normalization con-
dition:
X
E
W(E) = 1 ,
(S3)
The prime in eq. S1 indicates that the sum is re-
stricted to intervals that include E.
In the following we shall use a superscript (i) to
indicate the W and Z arrays at the ith iteration step,
i.e., W (i)(E) and Z(i)
j . Additionally, we shall assume
that W (i)(E) = 0 in correspondence of energy bins
where no states have been observed.
A.
Iterative procedure
With the above proviso, the density of states is
initialized to a trial profile W (0)(E), such as the one
obtained with the procedures discussed in subsec-
tions C and D. The jth element of the correspond-
ing Z array, Z(0)
j
is then calculated from eq. S2 using
W (0)(E) in place of W(E).
At the ith iteration step the W array elements
are updated with a relaxation procedure based on
eq. S1:
W(E)(i+1) = (1−α) W (i)(E)+α
P′
j
nj(E) Z(i)
j

Z(i)
j
−W (i)(E)


Z(i)
k −W (i)(E)
 .
(S4)
where the mixing coefficient α ∈(0 : 1) is small
enough to ensure convergence.
Next, the newly
computed W(E)(i+1) are rescaled by a normaliza-
tion factor to satisfy eq. S3. Finally, the normalized
W (i+1) array is used to compute the updated Z ar-
ray:
Z(i+1)
j
=
X
Emin(j)≤E≤Emax(j)
W (i+1)(E) ,
(S5)
The maximum usable values of the mixing param-
eter α depend on the number of energy bins in the
intervals and the dynamic range of the W elements
in the intervals, as discussed below. In practical im-
plementations, we found that the convergence rate
of the procedure is improved by nesting the updates
of eqs. S4 and S5 within a damped update of an
auxiliary Z array, see subsection D.
B.
Stability of the fixed point solution
We now consider the stability of the iterative pro-
cedure, showing that its fixed point is an attractor.
We shall indicate the fixed point solutions of eqs. S1–
S3 with a ∗superscript, i.e. W ∗and Z∗. In addition,
we shall set all gs equal to 1 for clarity, equivalent
to assuming that histogrammed data have been re-
sampled with a stride sufficiently large to remove
correlations.
Consider a perturbed density of states, f
W, ob-
tained by modifying the fixed point solution in cor-
respondence of a single energy value, ¯E,
f
W(E) =
(
W ∗(E) + ∆W
for E = ¯E,
W ∗(E)
otherwise,
