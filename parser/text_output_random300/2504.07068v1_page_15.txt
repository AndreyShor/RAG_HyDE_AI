where the second line is due to Lemma 14. The last line follows from the deﬁnitions of a(ρ1, γ) and a(ρ2, γ).
4. The function is convex for γ ≥0, so it is continuous for γ > 0. Furthermore, since the function is non-increasing,
the convexity implies that it is lower semi-continuous at γ = 0. On the other hand, since the ﬁdelity and the
quantum mutual information are all continuous functions of CPTP maps, and the domain of the optimization is
a compact set, the optimum is attained [10, Thms. 10.1 and 10.2], so, the function is also upper semi-continuous
at γ = 0. Combining the two observation, the function is continuous at γ = 0.

Lemma 13 (Alicki-Fannes [11]; Winter [12]). Let ρ and σ be two states on a bipartite Hilbert space A ⊗B with trace
distance 1
2∥ρ −σ∥1 ≤ǫ, then
|S(A|B)ρ −S(A|B)σ| ≤2ǫ log |A| + (1 + ǫ)h(

The quantum mutual information also satisﬁes a property called superadditivity.
Lemma 14 ([13]).
Let ρA1R1 and σA2R2 be pure quantum states on composite systems A1R1 and A2R2.
Let
N A1A2→B1B2 be a quantum channel, and ωB1B2R1R2 := N A1A2→B1B2(ρA1R1 ⊗σA2R2). Then,
I(B1B2 : R1R2)ω ≥I(B1 : R1)ω + I(B2 : R2)ω.
We apply quantum state redistribution [14, 15] as subprotocol to construct our direct (achievability) proofs, which
can be summarized as follows.
Theorem 15 (Quantum state redistribution [14, 15]). Consider an arbitrary tripartite state on ACB, with puriﬁcation
|ψ⟩ACBR. Consider n copies of the state for large n, on systems A1, · · · An, C1, · · · Cn, B1, · · · Bn, R1, · · · Rn. Suppose
initially Alice has systems A1, · · · An, C1, · · · Cn, and Bob has systems B1, · · · Bn. Then, there is a protocol transmitting
Q = n( 1
2I(C : R|B) + ηn) qubits from Alice to Bob, and consuming nE ebits shared between them, where Q + E =
S(C|B), so that the ﬁnal state is ǫn-close to (|ψ⟩ACBR)⊗n but C1, · · · Cn is transmitted from Alice to Bob, and such
that {ηn}, {ǫn} are vanishing non-negative sequences.
The properties of Koashi-Imoto decomposition are stated in the following theorem.
