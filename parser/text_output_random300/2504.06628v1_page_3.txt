equality is related to the rate of heat dissipation in the
medium
˙q(t) = F (r) ⋄˙r ≡kBT ˙sm,
(10)
where we identify the exchanged heat with an increase in
entropy of the medium sm at temperature T = DthΓ/kB.
The last term in the second equality of (9) corresponds
to the entropy increase caused by the active fluctuation

Then Eq. (9) is naturally written as a dynamic balance
equation for the trajectory-dependent total entropy pro-
duction

which is our first central result. The first term on the
right-hand side signifies a change in P(r, t), due to relax-
ation from a nonstationary initial state P(r, 0) ̸= P s(r).
Upon averaging, the total entropy production rate ˙stot
has to be non-negative as required by the second law.
This ensemble average proceeds in two steps. First, we
average over all trajectories of (4) that pass a given po-
sition r at time t leading to ⟨˙r | r, t⟩= J(r, t)/P(r, t) =
V (r, t), see Supplemental Material for the derivation de-
tail. Second, with
R
dr∂tP(r, t) = 0 due to total proba-
bility conservation, averaging over all r with P(r, t) leads
to
˙Stot(t) ≡
⟨˙stot(t)⟩=

dr|V (r, t)|2P(r, t)/Dth ≥0,
(13)
where the equality “=0” holds in equilibrium only. Aver-
aging the increase in entropies of the medium and active
fluctuation along similar lines leads to
˙Sm(t) ≡⟨˙sm(t)⟩= ⟨F (r) ⋄˙r⟩/(kBT )

is the L´evy
score function [43]. Hence upon averaging, the increase in
entropy of the system itself becomes ˙Ssys(t) ≡⟨˙ssys(t)⟩=
˙Stot(t) −˙Sm(t) −˙Sact(t). The foundation of this result
is that we have obtained entropy production (or annihi-
lation) along a single stochastic trajectory in Eq. (12),
splitting it up into a medium part, a system part, and an
active fluctuation part. These new developed concepts
facilitate the discussion of fluctuation theorems.
Fluctuation theorem—For Langevin dynamics driven
solely by Gaussian white noise, fluctuation theorems
arise from the transformation properties of the trajec-
tory weight under time reversal, which associated with
the reversed trajectory ˜r(t) = r(T −t), see e.g.
[42].
For a given initial condition r0 ≡r(0) = ˜r(T) ≡˜rT and
final condition rT ≡r(T) = ˜r(0) ≡˜r0, the ratio of the
probabilities of the forward path, P[r(t) | r0], and of the
backward path, ˜P[˜r(t) | ˜r0], can be readily calculated
for Langevin systems with only Gaussian thermal noise
using the path integral representation [42, 48].
For system described by (4), the time reversal process
˜r(t) is governed by [49, 50]:
d˜r(t)
dt
=
−F (˜r(t))/Γ + 2Dth∇log P(˜r(t), T −t)
+˜ηth(t) + ˜ηact(t),
(16)
where ˜ηth(t) is the Gaussian white noise with the same
statistical property of ηth(t), ˜ηact is the compound Pois-
son process with time- and state-dependent L´evy mea-
sure ˜νT −t(r, dz) dt := P (r+z,T −t)
P (r,T −t) ν( dz) dt. The explicit
definition of the path integral representation for r(t) of
(4) and ˜r(t) of (16) becomes infeasible [51, 52]. To ad-
dress this, we slice the trajectory r(t) into discrete time
intervals, i.e., 0 = t0 ≤t1 ≤· · · ≤tn = T. To see how
time reversal matters, we “redefine” the system entropy
as ssys(t) = −log ˜P(x(t), t) for a trajectory {x(t)}t∈[0,T ].
Furthermore, the transition densities, P(r, t|ri, ti) and
˜P(r, t|ri, ti), can similarly be transformed into continu-
ity equations via the probability flux method we used
before. Thus we can define the forward and backward
transition densities-based L´evy scores as:
SL,r(ti)(r, t) := −
Z 1
0
dθ
Z
ν( dz)z P(r −θz, t | r(ti), ti)
P(r, t | r(ti), ti)
,
˜SL,r(ti)(r, t) := −
Z 1
0
dθ
Z
˜νT −t(r, dz)z
˜P(r −θz, t | r(ti), ti)
˜P(r, t | r(ti), ti)
.
(17)
This generalization reveals a local-global statistical cor-
respondence that bridges the global statistical descrip-
tion and local dynamical behavior of the system. From
a mathematical perspective, the probability distribution
P(r, t) is the marginalization of the transition densi-
ties over all initial conditions, P(r, t) =
R
driP(r, t |
ri, ti)P(ri, ti). Hence, the transition density-based L´evy
score function captures the conditional, path-dependent
dynamics of the system (4),
while the probability
distribution-based definition in (15) reflects its global
statistical behavior. Physically, this correspondence em-
beds dynamical information from transition densities
