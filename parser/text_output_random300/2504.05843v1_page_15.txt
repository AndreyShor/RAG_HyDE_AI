However, singularities in a linear combination of the regulators complicate this step. While there is a
definite answer for the double box it will be interesting to see how this problem can be handled in more
complicated situations. Our scheme is definitely operational, yet it would be good to establish why the Euler
integrals we study can be singular in these parameters while the series from which they originate are apparently
regular.
Finally, the MB representation of any Feynman graph can be translated into an A-hypergeometric system
[22, 23]. What is more, it is possible to construct a Pfaffian system starting from the ideal of differential oper-
ators annihilating the underlying generalised hypergeometric function [24, 25]. In general, the resulting partial
differential equations are not of canonical form, though. Both approaches start from the MB representation
— can we pinpoint a link between the methods? While mathematically more advanced techniques are put
forward e.g. in [26] we emphasize that our calculations are not restricted to any cut; they rather give a full
evaluation.

Appendix A: MB representations for the one- and two-loop ladders
As the two box integrals are finite we work in exactly four dimensions. Further, since they are both conformal
we may amputate the propagators attached to one outer point without loss of information. To this end we
send the bottom point to infinity. In case of the one-loop box integral this leaves the propagators
