X1,...,10 = f 1,...,10(σ3),
(5.5)
where f 1,...,10(σ3) are functions that satisfy the gauge-ﬁxing condition.
This solution represents a particle-like state in the matrix model, where the
spatial components of the membrane are governed by the functions f 1,...,10(σ3),
and the temporal component is linearly dependent on σ3. The particle interpre-
tation arises because all spatial coordinates are reduced to functions of a single
parameter, σ3, resembling a worldline rather than an extended membrane.

Non-Commutative Membrane Solutions
Another class of solutions is the non-commutative membrane conﬁguration:
X0 = σ3,
(5.6)
X1 = x1,
(5.7)
X2 = x2,
(5.8)
X3,...,10 = 0,
(5.9)
with the non-commutative relation:
[x1, x2] = iθ.
(5.10)
This conﬁguration describes a two-dimensional membrane (M2-brane) that
is extended in a non-commutative manner. The coordinates x1 and x2 obey the
Heisenberg-like commutation relation, indicating a quantum geometry in the
membrane’s spatial extension.
In this scenario, σ3 plays the role of time, with the membrane evolving
over time while maintaining its non-commutative structure in the two spatial
dimensions.
This non-commutative solution provides a concrete example of
how the matrix model can describe extended objects with inherent quantum
geometric properties.
5.4
Multiple Non-Commutative Membranes
To describe multiple non-commutative membranes, one can use block-diagonal
matrices.
For example, in the case of two membranes, the matrices can be
chosen as:
X1 =
 x1
0
0
x1

,
(5.11)
X2 =
 x2
0
0
x2

.
