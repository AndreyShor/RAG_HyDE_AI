Figure 7: The above figures show the numerical plots of the mutual information (the top panel) and the concurrence
(the bottom panel) with two static UDWs as a function of the proper distance of the detector A from the event horizon
on a constant Painleve-Gullstrand time slice (x-axis) while keeping the distance between two detectors and all other
parameters fixed. In the plots, the black line represents the Unruh state, the red line represents the Hartle-Hawking-
Israel (HHI) state, and the purple line represents the Boulware state. Here, the two-point function corresponding to the
preserving conformal symmetry in the coupling frame is taken. We keep Ω= 2σ in all cases.
system is the Gullstrand–Painlev´e coordinates. In this scenario, both the proper distance between the detectors and
the gravitational redshift are subject to change over time. Additionally, the local temperature perceived by detectors,
defined in Eq.(68), also changes due to the combination of Hawking and anti-Hawking effects. We perform entanglement
harvesting by maintaining a constant proper separation, d(rA, rB), between the detectors at the time of peak of their
Gaussian switching function, τs0, as defined in Eq. (81). The entanglement harvesting is repeated with this setup multiple
times, varying the distances of the switching peak from the horizon while keeping d(rA, rB) constant, as shown in Figs. 9
and 10. The Gaussian switching is centered at the proper times of the individual detectors, given by

which is precisely the time taken by a freely falling test particle to arrive at rA or rB, respectively, starting from
infinity with zero initial velocity. It’s worth noting that in the case of the Boulware vacuum, we refrain from conducting
measurements very close to the horizon, as the freely falling detector must inevitably cross the horizon, and the state is
not well-defined in that region. Hence, we can compare entanglement measures at locations far away from the horizon
for the Boulware vacuum.
We have employed a pointlike detector, which means that in the case of free fall, it does not locally experience
any gravitational field.
This characteristic allows us to collect entanglement data very near the black hole horizon.
