FIG. 4. Panel (a) shows the temporal evolution of the prop-
agating droplet.
At t = 0 the field envelope is Gaussian
ψ(x, t = 0) = √ρm exp(−x2
w2p ) exp(ik0x), where ρm is the ini-
tial maximum of the condensate density, wp = 19.1 µm is the
width of the droplet, and k0 = 2 µm−1 is its initial central
wavevector. The upper picture of the panel corresponds to
ρm = 50 µm−2, the middle to ρm = 125 µm−2 and the bottom
one to ρm = 200 µm−2. The evolution of the spatial spectra of
the droplets is shown in panel (b). The white line marks the
central wavevector defined as kc =
R
kS(k)dk/N, the black
lines are kc±∆k S, where ∆k S =
qR
(k −kc)2S(k)dk/N. The
physical meaning of the black lines is that they show the area
filled by the condensate. The other parameters are g = 0,
λ = 1.4 · 10−3µm4 · ps−1.
cies of these parameters on the maximum density of the
initial distribution of the condensate after relatively long
propagation time. The results are summarized in Fig. 5.
Let us note that for the chosen parameters, the velocity of
the condensate is equal to its wavevector with good accu-
racy. Our conclusion is therefore that energy relaxation,
as expected, results in a decrease in the mean wavevec-
tor and hence in a decrease in the droplet velocity. This
effect also leads to a broadening of the spectrum. For
energy relaxation to be a nonlinear effect, the spectrum
modification is more pronounced for the droplets with
higher maximum densities.
Next, we study the evolution of the velocity of the
Gaussian droplets and find that there are asymptotics
at short and long times. To do this, we introduce the
quantity

FIG. 5.
Numerically calculated dependencies of the mean
wavevector kc
=
R
kS(k)dk/N and the spectrum width
∆k S =
qR
(k −kc)2S(k)dk/N on the maximum density ρm
of the initial condensate droplet are shown in panels (a) and
(b) correspondingly.
The parameters of the spatial spec-
trum of the condensate are measured after propagation time
t = 75 ps. The initial condensate field distribution is Gaus-
sian ψ(x, t = 0) = √ρm exp(−x2
w2p ) exp(ik0x) with the width
wp = 19.8 µm.
The blue line corresponds to the droplets
with the initial mean wavevector k0 = 0.7 µm−1, the red
curves are for k0 = 2 µm−1. The other parameters are g = 0,
λ = 1.4 · 10−3µm4 · ps−1.
The dependencies of these parameters on time are shown
in Fig. 6(a),(b) on the double logarithmic scale for differ-
ent initial wavevectors k0 and maximum densities ρm of
the condensate. It is seen that in a short time the depen-
dencies look as horizontal straight lines, and so z can be
approximated by a constant. This means that ˙v = −γv
and, consequently,
v(t) = v0 exp(−γt).
Let us note that the equation that governs the evolution
of the droplet at short propagation times coincides with
the equation for a particle moving under the action of
the viscous friction force.
In our equations, the non-linear terms (energy relax-
ation) scale linearly with the condensate density, and
from this we can expect that the deceleration rate γ
should also be proportional to ρm.
We check that in-
deed this is the case, and the deceleration rate can be
expressed as γ = γ0ρm. From our numerical simulations,
we find that γ0 ≈0.17 µm2 · ps−1 for the Gaussian pulse
of the width wp = 19.1 µm.
The fits overlapped with the numerically calculated de-
pendencies of the droplet velocity on time are shown in
Fig. 6(c),(d). It is seen that the fit describes the evolution
of the velocity well at short propagation times. At longer
times, the dispersive spreading of the envelope starts to
play a role, and the fit becomes inapplicable.
More surprisingly, there are asymptotics that work at
long propagation times. As one can see in Fig. 6(a),(b)
the dependencies z(t) look like inclined straight lines on
