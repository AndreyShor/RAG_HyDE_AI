This indeed coincides with the holomorphic solution of the Picard-Fuchs equation, see (3.9) below.
We proceed to confirm the topological data of the Calabi-Yau in the ζ ≫0-phase by computing
the central charge of the D6-brane associated to the structure sheaf. For this purpose, we consider
the following matrix factorisation
Q =
3
X
i=1
piηi + ∂W
∂pi
ηi,
(2.64)
where ηi, ηi are Clifford matrices satisfying {ηi, ηj} = δij with all other anticommutators zero. It
is easy to see that this is G-invariant13 and has R-charge 1. As explained in detail in [46], M can
be characterised in terms of “Wilson line branes”: M = ⊕W(q1, q2, q3)r labelled by weights qi, r of
irreducible representations of G and U(1)V , respectively. Combining this with the maps encoded
in the matrix factorisation, the GLSM B-brane is characterised by a (twisted) complex of Wilson
line branes. The object related to (2.64) that corresponds to the structure sheaf is
W(0, 0, 0)0
W(1, 1, 1)⊕3
1
W(2, 2, 2)⊕3
2
W(3, 3, 3)3.
(2.65)
The associated brane factor is
fB = −(−1 + e2π(σ1+σ2+σ3)).

We evaluate the hemisphere partition function in the ζ ≫0-phase and express the result in terms
of the Frobenius basis ϖ(LV )
i
(φ) of mirror periods. The overall normalisation is not fixed, however
it was demonstrated in [45] that the overall factor should include a scaling |W|, where W is the
Weyl group. Taking into account the Z3-factor in G, this suggests to set C = i(2π)6

For the ζ ≫0-phase we read off:
H3 = 30,
c2 · H = 36,
c3 = −30,
(2.69)
which is the expected result.
13In particular, this brane is invariant with respect to that Z3-symmetry.
It would be interesting to compare
D-brane categories of Calabi-Yaus and their free quotients by some discrete group.
