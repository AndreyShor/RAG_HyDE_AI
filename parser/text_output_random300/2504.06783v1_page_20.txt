Tropical diffusive mixing. We evaluate the kinetic energy dissipation rate for the analysis of the tropical 
diffusive mixing effects, which are crucial for maintaining global circulation. Because the turbulence is not 
resolved in our experiments, only the diagnosed kinetic energy dissipation rate of turbulence is computed. The 
following equation represents the diapycnal advection-diffusion balance, which is fundamental in our analysis:

where, 𝑁−2 = −

𝜕𝑧, ρ represents the potential density, ρ0 is the reference density, and ε is the diagnosed 
kinetic energy dissipation rate. The buoyancy flux is related to the turbulence ε through the constant efficiency 
factor Г [67]. The expression for ε on each layer, which is derived from relevant physical principles, is as 
follows: 
𝜀= ∫−𝑔

In this study, we set Г=0.2 and ρ0=1026 kg/m3. The constant C is ascertained by ensuring that the minimum 
value of the integration equals 0. The vertical mean of 𝜀 is defined as the mean energy dissipation rate εm in 
30° S–30° N. The tropical energy dissipation index εm(t) is defined as the linear regression coefficient of the 
monthly time slice of εm with respect to its temporal mean distribution. 
Correlation statistics significance 
Correlation significance is assessed via t-test, with critical values (rα) calculated as: 𝑟𝛼=
𝑡
√𝑡2+𝑑𝑓. For a 960-
month sample (α=0.001), coefficients r>0.105 indicate 99.9% significance, while r>0.089 denotes 99% 
significance. For ORAS5 comparisons (780 monthly data points, 1958–2022), the critical rα is 0.117.
