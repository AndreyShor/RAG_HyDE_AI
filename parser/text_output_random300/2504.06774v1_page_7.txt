neurons may lead to underfitting, while an excess can result in overfitting and increased
computational costs. Additionally, managing computational resources is vital, as complex
architectures will incur additional costs [32]. The complexity of the model must be care-
fully balanced with the available resources to ensure practical training and deployment.
A broad overview of these foundational aspects, not specific to any case but general prin-
ciples and strategies that were followed for the development of the optimization model,
are presented in the Appendix.
This integrated approach addresses the challenges of processing high-dimensional spatio-
temporal data by effectively capturing the underlying dynamics of fluid flows, which are
crucial for simulations in engineering and research applications. This section is organized
as follows: (i) data structure, (ii) modal decomposition techniques, (iii) deep learning
model, (iv) data preprocessing, and (v) autoregression.
The proposed hybrid ROM methodology is summarized in Figure 2. The approach
consists of the following key steps:
(a) The model is provided with N previous snapshots of the flow field, capturing its
evolution over time.
(b) The dimensionality of the snapshot data is reduced using SVD or HOSVD, resulting
in a set of dominant spatial modes and corresponding temporal coefficients.
(c) The temporal coefficients obtained from SVD/HOSVD are used as input to train
the DL model with an LSTM architecture, which learns their temporal evolution.
The trained LSTM model predicts the temporal evolution of the coefficients over a
specified future time horizon.
(d) The predicted coefficients are then used to reconstruct the solution and predict
the evolution of the flow field over time. Autoregression has been implemented to
predict over multiple timesteps.
