stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling, and provide instructive guidelines for prac-
titioners.
Molecular dynamics describes complex processes in microscopic detail but is limited in
timescale. Occasionally restarting the simulations can signiÔ¨Åcantly enhance the sampling
of rare events and overcome this timescale problem.
