As we have already mentioned above, the solution of the static problem of Eq. (S3) is rℓ+1, so that Hℓshould
have a solution, which for large z scales like z−ℓ−1. Since the solution of
L+
ℓφ = 0,
(S25)
is solved by
φ = (z2 −1)−(ℓ+1)/2,
(S26)
which has the correct z−ℓ−1 at large z; inspection of Eq. (S19), reveals that
a = ℓ+ 1,
(S27)
as we found above, in order Hℓto have the correct scaling solution z−ℓ−1 at large z.
NONLINEAR TAILS: THE RETARDED GREEN FUNCTION
Let us consider the diﬀerential equation for a generic scalar Ψ(r, t)
∂2Ψ(t, r)
∂t2
−∂2Ψ(t, r)
∂r2
(t, r) + ℓ(ℓ+ 1)

Ψ(t, r) = 0,
(S28)
where for large r we confuse r∗with r. The corresponding Green function GF (t, r; t′, r′) satisﬁes
∂2GF

−∂2GF
∂r′2 + ℓ(ℓ+ 1)

GF = δ(t −t′)δ(r −r′).

Expanding GF (t, r; t′, r′) in Fourier modes as
GF (t, r; t′, r′) =

φ = 0,
(S32)
which is just the Schr¨odinger equation for the scattering of stationary states in an 1/r2, corresponding to 1D
conformal quantum mechanics. Eq. (S32) is solved by the modes

(S33)
where jℓand nℓare spherical Bessel functions. Then, the Green function eG(ω, r, r′) turns out to be
eGF (ω, r, r′) = ωrr′

jℓ(ωr)nℓ(ωr′) θ(r −r′) + jℓ(ωr′)nℓ(ωr)θ(r′ −r)

so that the Green function in the time domain for r > r′ is given by
