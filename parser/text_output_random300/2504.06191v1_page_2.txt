II core collapse supernovae and can produce rare elements, it is not a major contributor to 
galactic scale production, the i-process [15, 16] for the intermediate neutron flux case and occurs 
in He-shell flashes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, it is of limited significance on the 
galactic scale, the ν-process [17, 18, 19] or neutrino process is involved in neutrino induced 
nucleosynthesis via neutral and charged currents which usually produces lighter elements and 
requires a large neutrino flux not present here, the rp-process [20, 21] for rapid proton capture 
followed by beta decay which is most relevant in light element production and the f-process for 
extremely fast neutron capture, much faster than the r-process, which is considered very exotic 
and not impactful in our kilonova and galactic environments. These processes are influenced by 
astrophysical conditions and nuclear physics inputs, including the equation of state (EoS), 
opacity functions κ, cross sections σ, neutrino interactions, masses and/or oscillations, where we 
model using the neutrino upper bound value [22, 23], and galactic scale stellar environments. 
The early work by Bethe [24], followed by Alpher, Bethe, and Gamow [25], with the 
development of the r and s processes by Cameron [26], which were critical for the foundation of 
the work of Suess and Urey [27], and the detailed work by Margret Burbridge, Geoffrey 
Burbridge, William Fowler and Fred Hoyle [28], established the relationship between stellar 
nuclear reactions and the production of chemical elements after the Big Bang [29]. The path 
from light elements to isotopes of Fe is complex and involves an understanding of relativistic 
hydrodynamics, r process relativistic nuclear reaction networks [30], weak interactions and 
neutrino physics [31], cross sections [32] and high-density reaction rates [33] well beyond 
nuclear saturation number density near 0.16 fm-3, energy transport with convection [34] and 
radiation, and numerous stable islands along with issues of stability [35] and energy release [36].  
Understanding these details often requires significant computational resources to focus on the 
best nuclear EoS. There are also several analytical models used to develop insightful and 
intuitive understanding of nuclear processes such as effective field theory [37], nuclear shell 
models [38], liquid drop models [39], lattice models [40], fission barrier and fission yield models 
[41], mean field theories [42], isospin theories [43], interacting plasma and fluid models [44, 45] 
and models based on phase changes similar to the modified and multicomponent van der Waals 
(MvdW) model [46, 47, 48, 49]. Once a star leaves the main sequence its future is intimately tied 
to its mass value.  Many final states will involve mass transfer and mass ejections resulting in 
violent or unusual shock waves and perhaps free quark matter or a superconducting color flavor 
locked compact core [50, 51]. On the galactic scale the magnitude and distribution of the stellar 
birth rate and metallicity distribution and gradient varies for each galaxy type. The spirals exhibit 
relatively flat disk metallicity and constant stellar birth rates with higher core values indicating 
sustained r and s processes with compact binary mergers actively promoting events [52, 53], 
elliptical galaxies show enhanced core metallicity with early high r process yields with less 
metal-rich outskirts [54, 55], while dwarf galaxies show weak metallicity gradients and low 
metallicities with the potential for multiple starburst eras indicative of bursty and stochastic rates 
with long quiescent periods [56, 57].  These differences can be captured with the Galactic Star 
Formation Rate function dM/dt, for each galactic type.  
Analytical modified equations of state can lead to an intuitive representation of dense 
astrophysical environments, such as neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernovae [58, 59]. 
Additionally, neutrino oscillations and masses affect the neutron-richness of these environments,
