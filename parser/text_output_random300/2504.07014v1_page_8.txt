and (A19) in four different phases. The plot is done for µa = 0.4, δ = 0.25, t⊥= 0.8. For those
parameters the critical points are: µc,1 = 0.68, µL = 1.12, µc,2 = 1.36.
Those zeros coincide with manifold of zeros of the inverse Matsubara single-particle Green’s
function.
At T = 0 the latter defines the (d −1)-dimensional FS which separates the
occupied and empty states. It is the surface of quantum criticality, and its appearance or
restructuring constitutes a Lifshitz quantum phase transition.
We propose to introduce the order parameter P for the gapless metallic phase as a d-
volume of the Fermi sea in the momentum space.
The goal of the following analysis is
to demonstrate that such bold proposal is consistent with the scaling properties of other
physical parameters, and in particular, with all scaling and hyperscaling relations, known
from the theory of quantum phase transitions, see, e.g., [31, 32].
Chain, ladder: Whether we consider the chain limit (t⊥= 0) of the Hamiltonian (2), or
the ladder with three critical points, we infer from the results of Sections II B and II C that
the order parameter near the critical points (µc,1, µc,2, µL) on the gapless side behaves as:
P = δkF ∝
p
|µ −µc| = |µ −µc|β,
where δkF ≡|kF −π
2 |

which, together with the results (8,9) for compressibility, determines two critical indices:
β = γ = 1/2
(18)
Since P is defined as the measure of the full Fermi sea, it adds up (P = P1 + P2) the
contributions of two disconnected Fermi seas when µL < µ < µc,2. From the scaling relation
α + 2β + γ = 2
(19)
we find
α = 1/2 .

At zero temperature the critical index of the heat capacity α is usually identified from the
