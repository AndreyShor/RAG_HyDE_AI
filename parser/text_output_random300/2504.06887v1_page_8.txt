2.3.2
Unruh state
In an astrophysical context, black holes are typically formed through the collapse of massive stars, and they do not
possess a white hole region. Consequently, astrophysical Schwarzschild black holes do not have radiation coming from
infinity. Instead, they only emit outgoing Hawking radiation, leading to a gradual decrease in their mass. Nevertheless,
due to their enormously long lifetimes, one can effectively consider the situation to be nearly time-independent. To
describe such a scenario, one constructs a state, namely the Unruh state, defined only by the black hole and the universe
region, and it reproduces the late-time thermal radiation [62]. Furthermore, the energy density and flux of outgoing
radiation far away from the horizon are numerically equal in this state [54]. One can understand the Unruh state as a
squeezed state of the initial state that closely resemble the Minkowski vacuum on I−. Here, one quantizes the field using
positive frequency on the past horizon with respect to the null generator ∂U of H−, and positive frequency modes are
derived with respect to the null generators ∂v on past null infinity.
Again, by imposing the conformal invariance discussed in the subsection 2.3.1, one can write down a two-point
function in metric shown in Eq.(4) by the knowledge of the two-point function in the Minkowski spacetime. This is the
same as substituting
bµ

in Eq.(99), which yields the following two-point function:

Converting the timelike component of the above tetrad (25), which represents the four-velocity of a frame moving with
tetrad, in the t-r plane by usual tetrad transformation and integrating, one gets the following trajectory:
r∗= −u/2 −Rse−u/2Rs + C2
(27)
with proper acceleration
a :=

aµaµ = ±cosh (u/4Rs) −2R2
s cosh (u/4Rs)/r2 + sinh (u/4Rs)

,
(28)
where C2 is an integration constant. For illustrative purposes, we show the plots for the trajectory and acceleration for
a particular value of C2 in Fig. 1.
The 2-bein corresponding to a static observer in the metric Eq.(4) are given by,

Using the above 2-bein, Eq. (29), in Eq. (99) yields the two-point function for the scalar density of the Fermionic field
in the Unruh vacuum:

where ∆U = (U −U ′) and ∆v = (v −v′). The 2-bein moving with a freely falling detector, expressed in terms of the
coordinates used in metric Eq.(4), is given by
