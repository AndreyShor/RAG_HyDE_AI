Finally, the pure singlet quark-to-quark splitting function starts at next-to-next-to-leading power
as x →1, i.e. it behaves as (1 −x) lnk(1 −x), with k ≤4. The coefficients of the higher logs
k = 3, 4 can be extracted by expanding the x = 1 expressions from Refs. [297, 298]. Hence, we
let

Note that for the qq and qg entries we also include the (known) next-to-leading power contri-
butions, while we do not include them for gq and gg because for these anomalous dimension
matrix elements a significantly larger number of higher Mellin moments is known, hence there
is no risk that the inclusion of these contributions could contaminate the intermediate x region
where they are not necessarily dominant. The explicit expressions of γ(3)
ij N→∞(N), γ(3)
ij N→0(N)
and γ(3)
ij N→1(N) are given in Appendix A of [3].
As discussed in Section 4.1.1, the remainder contribution eγ(3)
ij (N), Eq. (4.4), is determined by
expanding each of its matrix elements over a set of nij basis functions, where nij is the number
of known Mellin moments, and determining the expansion coefficients by demanding that
the known moments be reproduced. Specifically, the known moments are the four moments
computed in Ref. [296], the six additional moments for γqq,ps and γqg computed in Ref. [298]
and Ref. [299] respectively, and the additional moment N = 10 for γgg and γgq evaluated in
Ref. [300]. These constraints automatically implement momentum conservation:
γqg(N = 2) + γgg(N = 2) = 0 ,
γqq(N = 2) + γgq(N = 2) = 0 .
(4.23)
The additional 5 moments N = 12, . . . , 20 of γqg [302] were not available by the time of
writing, and are not included in the study. However, we refer to Appendix A for a discussion on
the impact of this newer constraints.
The set of basis functions is chosen based on the idea of constructing an approximation that
reproduces the singularity structure of the Mellin transform of the anomalous dimension viewed
