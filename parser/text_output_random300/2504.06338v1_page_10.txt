energy regime, oscillation in the concurrence for the sec-
ond (η = 3) and first (η = 6) harmonic can be clearly
noted in Γ1 = −1 polarisation state. We note, just as in
the circularly-polarised case, the order of which photon
polarisation state leads to the largest concurrence again
switches in the high energy regime, although both com-
ponents have a low value ≲0.3 of the concurrence.
We conclude this section by reiterating that the highest
level of spin-entanglement of the electron-positron pair
can be found in the intermediate intensity regime for a
highly polarised source of photons. An example scheme
to generate these photons is given in the next section.

Compton photon source
In this section, we consider the scattering of an
initially unpolarised electron beam with a laser pulse
to produce spin-entangled electron-positron pairs. The
laser pulse can split into a double-pulse that act in two
stages: I) the first pulse colliding via nonlinear Comp-

Figure 7. The electron-positron spin entanglement’s depen-
dence on the photon energy parameter η in a 4-cycle, linearly-
polarised laser background with ξ = 2.
Fig.
(a) contains
the dependence of fully polarised photons with Γ1 = ±1 and
fig. (b) for partially polarised photons with −1 < Γ1 < 1.
Fig. (c) is a plot of the total probability where the pertur-
bative contribution from the pulse envelope is clearly visible
for η ≲0.06. The collision energy parameter η changes from
0.03 to 10, with the corresponding change in photon energy,
from 2.7 GeV to 100 GeV, shown on the top axis in (a). The

ton scattering (NLC) with the electron beam to pro-
duce a polarised photon source [96, 97]; II) the second
pulse colliding with the photons (after filtering away any
charges with magnets) to produce pairs, whose spin is
then measured downstream after further separation with
magnets. For the electron and laser beam parameters,
we take those typical of upcoming experments such as
LUXE [51, 54, 98] and E320 [53] operating with electron
energies ∼O(10) GeV (η ∼O(0.1)) and laser intensities
ξ ∼O(1).
In stage I) nonlinear Compton produces photons most
abundantly in the same polarisation state as that of the
laser pulse [93, 99].
For the parameters of interest, it
can be seen from Figs. 3 and 4 that spin-entanglement
is maximised in a circularly polarised background if the
photon is perpendicular to the laser beam (Γ3 = −c)
but from Figs. 6 and 7 maximised in a linearly po-
larised background if the photon is polarised parallel to
the laser beam. This suggests two experimental scenar-
ios: one with two circularly polarised pulses rotating in
opposite directions (which we will refer to as the ‘CP-
