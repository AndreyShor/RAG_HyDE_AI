3. ESTABLISHING AN INFORMATION 
DATABASE FOR EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF 
THE RECONSTRUCTED GAS PIPELINE SYSTEM 
During the reconstruction phase of complex gas 
pipelines, the acquisition of analytical expressions for 
operational management in an engineering context, along 
with the computational sequence for practical examples, 
has been investigated. Initially, known mathematical 
expressions reflecting the gas-dynamic processes of the 
transported gas flow under unsteady conditions were 
theoretically examined to justify the practical application 
of the proposed efficient technological model for the 
reconstruction of complex gas pipeline systems. 
To substantiate the targeted technological variant for 
reconstruction, the process of pressure variation with 
respect to time along the pipeline length was studied in 
three specific sections (Figure 5). Two gas pipeline 
systems, with different parameters and suitable for 
practical operation, were selected for analysis. For the 
goal-oriented 
solution 
of 
the 
defined 
problems, 
simulations were conducted for various failure scenarios, 
where gas leakage occurred at different locations (near 
the start, end, and central parts) of the pipeline. 
The pressure variation process in the beginning and 
end sections of both pipelines during emergency 
conditions was analyzed in detail. The results of 
parameter calculations for each pipeline variant were 
compared. The analysis revealed that despite differences 
in the dimensions and parameters of the selected gas 
pipelines, the results of the obtained analytical function 
and calculation performance remained consistent. 
This finding demonstrates that regardless of the 
location of gas leakage during an emergency, the defined 
analytical function reaches its maximum and minimum 
values simultaneously in both pipelines. This indicator 
confirms the accuracy of the proposed analytical 
expressions and supports the practical applicability of the 
obtained data. 
The fixed time duration is deemed acceptable for 
pipeline management at the agreed operational level. The 
analysis of the calculated values of the analytical 
expressions at the specified fixed time reveals that these 
values constitute a reliable and effective information base 
for the dispatcher control center. Thus, the analysis of the 
parameters at a particular time, t=t1, enables the 
identification of whether the pressure changes in the end 
sections of the pipeline are due to an emergency or a 
change in the technological regime. In this context, the 
dispatcher control center can make an informed decision 
regarding the activation of the modern pipeline 
management system. 
To establish an information database for the efficient 
management of the reconstructed gas pipeline system, the 
reporting Figure was implemented in the following 
sequence. First, let's assume that the integrity of the 
second pipeline in the parallel gas pipeline has been 
compromised, resulting in a large amount of gas leaking 
from the damaged section (
2
x = ) into the environment 
(Figure 4).   
At this time, the undamaged pipeline continues to 
operate in its previous stationary regime. In other words, 
the non-stationary regime that arises in the damaged 
pipeline does not affect the undamaged pipeline. As 
shown in Figure 4 the non-stationary regime of gas flow 
in the damaged gas pipeline due to the accident is divided 
into three different technological sections:

The hydraulic models of all three sections are 
different. The hydraulic model of the pipeline system is 
constructed from the models of its components: multi-
line pipelines with loops and connectors, shut-off valves, 
compressor 
stations, 
etc. 
The 
models 
of 
these 
components, in turn, consist of the computational 
expressions for the elements. The solution to this problem 
necessitates considering the entire system as a whole 
rather than just a separate section of the pipeline. Initially, 
there is a significant need for analytical expressions to 
solve the equations describing non-stationary events in 
parallel gas pipelines and for mathematical expressions to 
solve these equations that reflect real events in the 
pipeline. The non-stationary operating conditions of 
pipelines lead to significant pressure changes and 
disruptions in the normal operation of gas delivery to 
consumers. Studying these processes to efficiently 
manage the pipelines and considering the results of the 
obtained analytical solution methods at dispatcher control 
points will significantly enhance the reliability of gas 
supply and the efficiency of transportation processes. 
For this purpose, it is essential to obtain the analytic 
expressions reflecting the non-stationary events in the 
two-line 
parallel 
gas 
pipelines 
and 
ensure 
the 
management of physical processes through the solution of 
these equations. The mentioned analytic expressions have 
been determined based on the resolution of the problem 
addressed in our published work [7], which specifically 
deals with the non-stationary flow of gas in each of the 
three sections. These expressions are as follows [7].
