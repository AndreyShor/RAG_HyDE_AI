Like Vsi, divacancies are often introduced through high-energy irradiation or ion implantation.  Shafizadeh 
et al. [67] have used high-purity 4H and 6H SiC samples and studied the selection rules of divacancies 
which were introduced by electron irradiation and subsequent annealing.  Sun et al. [68] have used proton 
irradiation 250 keV to introduce both, silicon vacancies and divacancies.  Almutairi et al. [69] have 
achieved direct writing of divacancy arrays in 4H-SiC using the femtosecond laser and subsequent thermal 
annealing. He et al. [28] fabricated single divacancy arrays in 4H-SiC using the He FIB with an energy of 30 
keV. The samples were annealed after implantation at 500 ∘C for 2 h to generate monovacancies, followed 
by a post-annealing at 900 ∘C for 1 h to facilitate monovacancy migration and divacancy formation. 
Additionally, the authors have used C ion with the same energy, but enhanced optical and spin 
characteristics were notably observed after He ion compared to C ion implantation. Figure 8 shows 
confocal scanning image of the introduced divacancy arrays.

As already said, the divacancy has four configurations in 4H-SiC (hh,kk,hk and kh) which are shown in 
Figure 5. Correspondingly, there are four PL lines in 4H-SiC known as Pl1, PL2, PL3, and PL4. [22,54,67]. 
The PL5 and PL6 lines, which have been previously detected but not convincingly assigned, are suggested
