Figure S4(a)(b) shows the functional forms of Eq. (16) for different resonator frequencies.
The downward shift at lower temperatures (kBT < hfr) can be attributed to the digamma
function (Fig. S4(c)), while the upward shift originates from the logarithmic term (Fig.
S4(d)). Additionally, Fig. S4(e)(f) shows the individual contributions of each term used
to fit the laser-induced frequency shifts. The exponential function, g′(x), approximately
reproduces the digamma function (Fig. S4(c)(e)). Moreover, when hfr/(2πkBT) ∼1, the
logarithmic term can be approximated by a linear function (Fig. S4(f)), since

Based on the above considerations (Fig. S4 and Eq. (17)), we adopt 1−exp(1 −ax) and bx
as the fitting functions for estimating the fitting parameters in the main text. We also assume
that (1) laser irradiation can induce excitation of TLS and alter their average population,
(2) the effect of these changes can be captured by the basic temperature-dependent TLS
model, and (3) the optical power does not correspond to the equilibrium temperature (i.e.,
Popt ̸∝T).
Temperature and Optical Power Dependence of the Resonance Frequency
To clarify the differences between equilibrium temperature increases and the effects of
laser irradiation, we measure the laser-induced frequency shifts at different temperatures.
Figure S5 shows the laser power dependence of ∆fr/fr for different mixing chamber temper-
atures ranging from 15 mK to 600 mK. The overall trend of the frequency shifts, whether
they are lower or higher, remains unchanged with increasing temperature. Additionally, the
