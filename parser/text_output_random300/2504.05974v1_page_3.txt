FIG. 2: The 68% (inner) and 95% (outer) C.I. bounds
on cφ (upper) and δκ3 (lower panel) in linear and
quadratic EFT fits to different datasets.
sult, consistent with Fig. 1, indicates that in the global
SMEFT analysis there is a negligible correlation between
Oφ and other operators. Third, quadratic EFT correc-
tions to the determination of κ3 at the HL-LHC are small
but not negligible, loosening the linear bound by 15%.
The Higgs trilinear coupling at the FCC-ee. As
mentioned above, Oφ can be constrained at the FCC-
ee through NLO electroweak corrections to Zh produc-
tion [27–30]. To illustrate the correlation between cφ and
other contributions to Zh at the FCC-ee, Fig. 3 presents
the same information as Fig. 1 now for the projected
Zh signal strength measurement at √s = 240 GeV. The
displayed 68% C.I. constraints are derived from a global
quadratic HL-LHC+FCCee@240 fit excluding Zh. Un-
like the HL-LHC case, at the FCC-ee several SMEFT
operators will be constrained from Zh at the same time
as cφ, in particular cφW and cφ□, and hence one ex-

pects potentially large differences between individual and
marginalised constraints for the Wilson coefficient cφ.
These expectations are validated by the results shown
in Fig. 2 and Tables I and II. The marginalised 68% C.I.
bound on δκ3 from the linear global SMEFT analysis at
the FCC-ee is |δκ3| ≤0.29 without the √s = 365 GeV
run, and |δκ3| ≤0.17 when including it.
Compar-
ing with the corresponding projections for the HL-LHC,
|δκ3| ≤0.32, one finds that the FCC-ee operating at
up to √s = 240 GeV would not improve significantly on
the HL-LHC legacy constraints, while the addition of the
√s = 365 GeV run enables a factor of two improvement.
A similar picture holds for the marginalised bound in
the quadratic analysis, where the HL-LHC expectation
of −0.26 ≤δκ3 ≤0.49 improves to −0.20 ≤δκ3 ≤0.41
at FCC-ee@240 and −0.15 ≤δκ3 ≤0.16 after the full
FCC-ee program.
A striking feature of Fig. 2, consistent with Fig. 3,
is the large difference between the individual and
marginalised bounds on κ3 at the FCC-ee@240.
In
the linear analysis, the individual bound of |δκ3| ≤
0.09 becomes a factor of 3 worse at the marginalised
level, |δκ3| ≤0.29, with a similar degradation found in
