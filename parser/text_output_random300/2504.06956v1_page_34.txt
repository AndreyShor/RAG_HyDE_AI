Lemma 4.20. For each λ > 0, for 0 ≤k ≤k′ ≤b −1, and u ∈[b1/4, b3/4], by choosing k large
enough, it holds that

Similarly, for all k ≥0 sufficiently large, one has that

Proof. We only prove the bound for the Brownian bridge since the bound for the Brownian motion can
be obtained in the same way. As usual, we can assume that we are on the event {Kb ≤k}, otherwise
the conclusion follows trivially from Lemma 4.10. For j ∈{k, . . . , b −1}, thanks to Lemma 4.9, it
holds that

and also
{M0,b(Υb,g) ≤λ, Kb ≤k} ⊆

{Bj ≥−λ −2Rk(j)} .
The claim follows since by Lemma A.11 it holds that

Finally, we note that the bound (4.52) follows directly from Theorem A by taking the limit as b →∞
in (4.51).
Remark 4.21. An immediate consequence of (4.52) is that there almost surely exists a (random)
k ≥0 such that, for all j ≥k, the supremum of the field eΥλ on the annulus Aj is less than −(log j)2.

Tail estimates for near-maximal level sets
In this section, we establish a key result concerning the tail behaviour of the volume of “near-maximal
level sets” |Dλ
0,j(Υb,g)|, for j ≤b, where here we recall the notation introduced in (3.3), as well as the
definition of Υb,g in (4.3). Throughout this section, we assume that the field gb satisfies (G1) – (G3).
Lemma 4.22. There exists δ = δ(d) ∈(0, 1) such that for any j0 > 0 sufficiently large and b > j0
sufficiently large, it holds for any λ > 0, j ∈{j0, . . . , b}, u ∈[b1/4, b3/4], and η ≥0,
P0,u,b(|Dλ
0,j(Υb,g)|−1 ≥η, M0,b(Υb,g) ≤λ) ≲u
b (1 ∧η−(1+δ)) .
(4.53)
Moreover, for all σ ∈[0, δ), it holds that
E0,u,b

Remark 4.23. As usual, the previous lemma admits a corresponding version for Brownian motions
in place of Brownian bridges. Specifically, if we replace the conditional probability law P0,u,b with
the unconditional probability law P, then the conclusions of the previous lemma remain valid, with
the only difference that u/b is replaced by 1/
√
b.
