of the roots z± must leave the real axis, while it is not sufficient, as we infer from the case
µ > µc,2. The arguments of the complex z+ and z−cancel, and the phase is fully filled
(polarized) with ¯n = 1. See Fig. 4.
Appendix B: d-dimensional fermions - Lee-Yang zeros, scaling, and correlation
functions
The static density-density response function, defined in the standard way [67]
χ(q) = χ◦L(q)
(B1)
is given for the free Fermi gas by the contribution of the particle-hole loop of the single-
particle Green’s functions. The dimensionless Lindhard function is normalized such that
L(0) = 1. The homogeneous response χ◦= χ(0)
χ◦= ∂¯n
∂µ = dN(µ) ,
(B2)
is equal (up to a factor d) to the density of states per spin or flavor:
N(µ) ≡

Free non-relativistic fermions
Consider the grand canonical ensemble of non-relativistic d-dimensional fermions with the
spectrum ε(k) = k2/2m (2mµ(T = 0) = k2
F, µc = 0). The Lee-Yang zeros of the partition
function are the zeros of the inverse temperature Green’s function [28]:
Y
k,n
G−1(k, ωn) = 0 ,
(B4)
where
G−1(k, ωn) = iωn −ε(k) + µ .
(B5)
No phase transition can occur at T ̸= 0, since ∄k ≡|k| ∈R to solve (B4,B5). Using
notations (14) for the complex solution of (B4,B5) one can easily find [28] for T/εF ≪1 the
wave vector of the IC oscillations9
q = kF + O((T/εF)2)
(B6)
and the inverse correlation length
κ = πmT/kF .
(B7)
In the limit T →0 the roots (B6,B7) yield the manifold of the QPT points in the range of
real k:
µ = ε(k) ,
(B8)
9 Note that in the analysis of the Lee-Yang zeros of the ladder model, z is just a convenient parameter
to map the 1D BZ onto a unit circle |z| = 1. The actual task is to identify the transition point(s) as the
solutions for zeros of the partition function in the real range of parameters and, in particular, for real values
k ∈Rd in the reciprocal space at finite volume V .
