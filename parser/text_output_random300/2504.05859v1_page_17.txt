Figure 5. The electric field dependence of hot-electron extraction with electron doped 
and neutral MoSe2. (a, b) The 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 dynamics with varying 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸. 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷 is set to 1.9 V and 
0 V, corresponding to electron doped MoSe2 with 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 about 0.7 ×1012 cm-2 (a) and 
neutral MoSe2 (b), respectively. The dynamics is fitted with a two-exponential function. 
(c, d) The electric field dependences of 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸,𝑚𝑚 and the corresponding hot-electron 
extraction efficiency for the two doping scenarios. Dashed lines are eye-guidance to the 
linear behavior.
