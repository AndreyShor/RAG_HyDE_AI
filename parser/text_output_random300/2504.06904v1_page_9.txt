From the analysis of Figure 7, it can be noted that the 
variation of pressure over time in the outer sections 
depending on the location of the gas pipeline's leakage is 
similar to that observed in Figure 6. Specifically, when 
θ>0.5, the p(t) function takes its minimum value 
(indicated by the 3rd line in Figure 7), while for θ<0.5, 
the p(t) function takes its maximum value (indicated by 
the 1st line in Figure 7). 
However, regardless of the location of the gas 
pipeline's leakage, the p(t) function takes its maximum or 
minimum value over a duration of t=120 seconds. This 
means that the fixed duration t1=120 seconds is 
applicable for this gas pipeline. It can be concluded that 
the fixed duration varies depending on the length of the 
gas pipeline and the parameters of the gas flow. Thus, as 
the length of the pipeline segment decreases, this duration 
decreases accordingly. This is because the time required 
for the parameters of the non-stationary gas flow during 
the accident to reach the starting point of the gas pipeline 
is related to the change in the parameters. Considering the 
short length of the analyzed gas pipeline segment and the 
reliability of the information transmitted to the dispatcher 
station, it is necessary to accept a minimum duration of 
fixation that is sufficient to record the change in pressure 
of the non-stationary gas flow at the dispatcher station. 
In other words, even if the speed of the non-stationary 
gas flow in the pipeline matches its sound propagation 
speed, the delivery time of information from the last three 
points of a 100000-meter pipeline segment to the starting 
point cannot be faster than 261 seconds. It should be 
noted that considering this indicator during the 
reconstruction stage of gas pipelines for efficient 
management allows for the optimization of the issue of 
minimizing the transfer time of information and control 
system data to dispatcher control centers.  
We conduct theoretical research to examine the 
consistency of the method for determining the fixing time 
t=t1, which is one of the measures taken to reduce the 
workload of the dispatcher station. For this purpose, we 
perform engineering calculations based on theoretical 
research. Using Equation (5), we determine the location 
of the pipeline's instability point at each of the three 
characteristic points, depending on time. First, we 
calculate based on the data of the gas pipelines under 
consideration, with a length of L=100000 m, and record 
the calculation results in Table 3.

Sequentially, based on the given data for the next gas 
pipeline with a length of L= 30000 m, we calculate the 
locations of instability points at each of the three 
characteristic points using Equation (5) and record the 
results in Table 4. Based on the analysis of Tables 3 and 
4, it can be noted that the prescribed Equation (5) is 
useful for engineering calculations. The results of both 
analyzed gas pipelines' calculations showed that only at 
the fixed time t=t1 is the location of instability accurately 
determined, with its relative error value not exceeding 
0.04, or in other words, less than 4%. 
Therefore, the prescribed calculation Figure is a 
suitable method for verifying the compliance of gas 
pipelines with the requirements for safe and efficient 
utilization, determining the parameters of gas flow in 
non-stationary regimes, as well as selecting appropriate 
parameters for the reconstruction of gas pipelines.
