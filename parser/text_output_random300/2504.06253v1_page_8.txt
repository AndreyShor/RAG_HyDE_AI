Because the superscript on 𝛼, P will be made clear by the warmstart in consideration, it will be dropped from
here on.5
Because 𝛼, P ∈[0, 1] by construction, they serve as a comparable performance metric for the different warmstarts
applied to either 𝐻Q
𝑄or 𝐻M
𝐴.6 In principle, one could compute (𝛼, P) for the Max-Cut case first, or first project
down onto the QUBO space and then compute (𝛼, P). Because of how these metrics are defined, either procedure
for computing the metrics gives the same result, allowing for a fair comparison.

Example Problems Instances
Representative quadratic optimization problems were utilized for benchmarking, with most being non-QUBO-
Relaxed. These example problems include
• Random QUBOS. These are QUBOs where the matrix elements of 𝑄are chosen either uniformly from
[−1, 1] or discretely from {−1, 1}.
5Obtaining the optimal solution to either the QUBO or Ising problem by measuring the QAOA output requires sufficiently large P. With that
being said, there is no way to directly optimize P without knowing the optimal solution ahead of time, so QAOA optimizes the expectation
directly instead, which is turn optimizes for the approximation ratio 𝛼.
6The approximation ratio 𝛼is not evenly distributed over states. See Appendix D
