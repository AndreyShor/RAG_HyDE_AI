FIG. 2: The Feynman checkerboard model: The
red line is the projection of the light cone on the right
half x–t plane. Here we only plot the first quadrant of
the x–t plane for convenience.
particle can only move forward or backward in one di-
mension at a speed of light, c. The particle occasionally
reverses its direction at a rate proportional to the rest
mass, m. This generates a random walk, as sketched in
Fig. 2. The corresponding wave function of that particle
is assumed to change its amplitude by a factor iMϵ after
each reversal, where ϵ is the small time step into which
the path is discretized. Thus the propagator K for the
Dirac equation is given as [15]
K =
X
R
N(R)(iMϵ)R,
(23)
where M = mc/ℏ, R is the number of reversals or corners
on the path illustrated in Fig. 2, and N(R) is the total
number of paths with R corners. The sum in the propa-
gator Eq. (23) can—according to Ref.[22]—be evaluated,
giving,
K = σxJ0(Ms) + icτ
s J1(Ms) + i∆x
s σzJ1(Ms).
(24)
with s =
√
c2τ 2 −∆x2 where τ = t−t′ and ∆x = x−x′.
The Pauli matrices in the propagator Eq. (24) assume
the following representation of the 1+1D Dirac equation
(iγµ∂µ −mc/ℏ)Ψ = 0
with γ0 = σx and γ1 = −iσy. We should also note that,
in Feynman’s model, all paths are confined inside the
light cone which is illustrated as a red line in Fig. 2.
Thus we should multiply Eq. (24) with a factor θ(s2)
with θ being the Heaviside step function. As we shall now
show, the propagator in Eq. (24) omits two delta function
terms.
To find those missing terms, let us apply the
method described in the previous sections to the 1 + 1D
Dirac equation.
Using the same approach given above, we see the func-
tion F(Ψ, G) in Eq. (9) is,
F(Ψ, G) = iG†γµΨ.
(25)
Similarly, we choose the volume V in Eq. (8) to be the
upper hemisphere of the spacetime coordinates, x and t
(if xA is in the upper hemisphere). Since ∂µ(iG†γµΨ) =
δ(xA −xB)Ψ(xB), we have
Ψ(xA) =
ˆ
t=0
−iG(xA −xB)†γ0Ψ(xB)d3x
which shows directly that the propagator for the Dirac
equation is
K(xA −xB) = −iG(xA −xB)†γ0.
(26)
There are four choices of contours for the Green’s func-
tion in Eq. (26). Two of them are not restricted in the
light cone. In order that paths are confined inside the
light cone, we choose the retarded Green’s function
G = −(iγµ∂µ + M)G+
(27)
where G+ is the retarded Klein–Green function in
Eq. (21). Explicitly, the 1 + 1D retarded Dirac–Green
function Eq. (27) is
G = −Mθ

The first three non–delta terms in propagator Eq. (29)
are identical to those in the propagator Eq. (24) that
is derived from the Feynman checkerboard model [22],
except for a normalization factor iM.
The propagator
Eq. (29) becomes a δ function when τ vanishes. In con-
trast, the propagator Eq. (24) does not. Notably, when
the mass vanishes— a case not considered by Feynman,
namely, m = 0, the first three terms in Eq. (29) also
vanish as does the propagator Eq. (23).
In this case,
the Dirac equation is identical to the 1 + 1D Maxwell
equations in free space. These δ terms in the propagator
Eq. (29) simply mean that the wave propagates freely
with a retarded time |∆x|/c. This fact is excluded from
Feynman’s propagator Eq. (23) [15] which vanishes when
m = 0. In fact, the additional δ (τ −|∆x|/c) is related to
those paths on the light cone which have no corner in the
Feynman checker board model, as illustrated as a red line
