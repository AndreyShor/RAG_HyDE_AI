GRAPHICAL FUNCTIONS WITH SPIN

6. Three-point functions and the definition of graphical functions
A three-point function has three external vertices 0 = z0, z1, and z2. By scaling all internal variables
we obtain
(41)
Aα
G(0, z1, z2) = ∥z1∥−2λNGAα
G(0, z1/∥z1∥, z2/∥z1∥).
To define the graphical function of G we use the coordinates (in a suitably rotated coordinate frame)
(42)
ˆz1 =
z1
∥z1∥=


.
Note that ˆz2 is normalized by the length of z1 and hence not a unit vector in general. With (42) we
obtain
(43)
f α
G(z) = Aα
G(0, ˆz1, ˆz2).
Alternatively, we may express the invariants
(44)
∥z2 −z0∥2
∥z1 −z0∥2 = zz,
∥z2 −z1∥2
∥z1 −z0∥2 = (z −1)(z −1)
in terms of the complex variable z and its complex conjugate z.
With these identifications we can
equivalently define the graphical function of G as the function f α
G(z) that fulfills the equation
(45)
Aα
G(0, z1, z2) = ∥z1∥−2λNGf α
G(z).
The Feynman integral Aα
G(0, ˆz1, ˆz2) is a linear combination of products of the metric g and the vectors
ˆz1, ˆz2. To express this linear combination, we proceed in analogy to the previous sections and define a
partition of the spin index set α = {α1, . . . , α|α|} into π0
1, . . . , π0
N, π1, π2, where the sets π0
i = {π0
i1, π0
i2}
are pairs. The slots π1 and π2 may have any number of elements. We always distinguish between π0, π1,
and π2, see Section 5. Let Πα
2 be the set of all these partitions. The set Πα
2 has
(46)
|Πα

for the corresponding expansion into products of g, ˆz1, and ˆz2 (where 2N + m + n = |α|).
Using (42), we can express the scalar products ˆzα1
i ˆzα1
j , i, j ∈{1, 2} in terms of z and z,

ˆzα1

With the above notation we obtain
(49)
f α
G(z) =
X
π∈Πα
2
fG,π(z)gπ0 ˆzπ1
1 ˆzπ2
2 ,
with an analogous expansion for Aα
G(0, z1, z2) from Equation (45).
In the following we often consider the graphical function f α
G(z) as a vector with components fG,π(z),
(50)
f α
G(z) ↔(fG,π(z))π∈Πα
2 .
Note that f α
G(z) depends via ˆz1, ˆz2 on the orientation of the coordinate system, while the vector
(fG,π(z))π∈Πα
2 does not. We can use any orientation of the coordinate system (and in particular (42)) to
determine the scalar functions fG,π(z).
It is possible to follow the previous sections and express f α
G(z) in terms of spin zero graphical functions
by dualizing π ∈Πα
2 and lifting ˆπ to the graph algebra with coefficients in Q(D, z, z). In particular, we
define the bilinear form
(51)
⟨π1, π2⟩2 = gπ0

for π1, π2 ∈Πα

Lemma 10. The bilinear form ⟨·, ·⟩2 is nondegenerate.
