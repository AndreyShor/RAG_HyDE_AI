Figure 4. Time evolution of interaction strength g(t) and corresponding temporal fidelity F(t)
for the system of three fermions, obtained for different numbers of single-particle orbitals C.
We notice that for C = 14 further increasing of the cut-off does not change the results and
they are well converged. In both plots the system parameters are fixed at T = 3.5ω−1, g2 = 2
and −gA = gB = 0.5
.
the system |ini⟩= |Ψ0(0)⟩and we aim to reach the target state |tar⟩= |Ψ0(g2)⟩in finite time
T having experimental access only to strengths bounded by |g| ≤0.5. As anticipated in Sec.
2, we consider three different scenarios with g ∈[−0.5, 0.5], g ∈[0, 0.5], and g ∈[−0.5, 0].
Determination of the maximal possible final fidelity for this system is straightforward. First,
we optimize the time-dependence of the interaction strength g(t) for a given protocol period
T and a fixed number of optimization instants M. Then, we increase the number of points
M and we monitor a saturation of the fidelity to its upper bound. In this way, we obtain
the maximal possible fidelity which is presented in Fig. 3 for three different experimental
limitations and two different target interactions, g2 = 1 and g2 = 2.
In all the cases
the final fidelity can be saturated close to 1 for sufficiently large protocol time T and, of
course, for smaller g2 saturation becomes faster. Moreover, similarly, as in the case of a
two-qubit system, access to a wider range of interactions supports the reduction of the
minimal time required. This fact is well-reflected by estimated quantum speed limit time
TQSL which strongly depends on the assumed range. Also in this case, for the opposite-sign
interactions scheme, the final fidelity is robust against improvements if the protocol time is
not sufficiently long.
To show that our results are well-converged in terms of the assumed cut-off C = 14
of single-particle basis, in Fig. 4 we present example results of the optimization procedure,
with the target interaction g2 = 2, performed for fixed protocol time T = 3.5ω−1 and the
number of optimization instants M = 10 obtained under different cut-offs C assumed. When
the assumed cut-off is insufficient (red solid line) the target state |tar⟩is not determined
appropriately and even initial fidelity is not accurate. However, the optimization scheme
enables one to find interaction path g(t) saturating the final fidelity close to 1. Along with
increasing cut-off C optimization is improved and for a sufficiently large value its further
increase does not change the results (black solid line and black circles).
