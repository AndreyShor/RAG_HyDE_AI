We adopt the same setting assumption in this paper. In addition we assume the SU(5)GUT
representations for all the fermions.
But, we gauge only the standard model (SM) group,
SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)Y , that is a subgroup of the SU(5)GUT.
There are three fixed points, I, II and III, in the extra two dimensions of T 2/Z3. We put
each 10i (i = 1, 2, 3) on the each fixed point, separately. We assume all 5∗
i (i = 1, 2, 3) and
the SM Higgs H are living in the two dimensional bulk. We assume the Higgs H belongs to
a 5 representation of the SU(5)GUT and 10i10jH Yukawa coupling at the fixed points. We
realize a diagonal mass matrix for the up-type quarks by taking the size of the T2/Z3 orbifold
dimensions sufficiently large [1]. Notice that all masses for the up-type quarks are real, since
all Yukawa coupling constants are real because of our basic assumption of the CP invariance at
high energies. The vacuum-expectation value (vev) of the Higgs, < H >, can be always taken
real by using the U(1)Y hypercharge gauge transformation.
We now impose an anomaly free discrete Z2 flavor symmetry to have several zeros in the
mass matrix for the down-type quarks. There are four choices for the Z2 charges for the 10s,
that is, three + s and zero −; two +s and one −; one + and two −s; zero + and three −s.
However, the first and fourth choices are unable to reproduce the observed CKM matrix with
a real determinant of the down-type quark mass matrix, and the second and third choices are
essentially equivalent. Thus, we have only one choice for the Z2 charge. We fix it as two +s
and one −. Then, the charges of the 5∗are determined as two +s and one −so that the
discrete Z2 is free from anomaly 3. We take the SM Higgs to be even(+) for the Z2.
We have three generations for the 10s, that is, 101, 102 and 103. Thus, we have three
assignments of the Z2 charges as 101,2,3 = (−, +, +); (+, −, +); (+, +, −) 4. And we have
three charge assignment for the 5∗s as 5∗
1,2,3 = (−, +, +); (+, −, +); (+, +, −), too. Therefore,
we have 3 × 3 = 9 assignments for the Z2 charge in total. However, it turns out that only the
case of 101,2,3 = (−, +, +) can reproduce correctly the observed CKM matrix and charged
lepton mass ratios. Thus, we have only three type of the charge assignments called Ai type:
A1; 101,2,3 = (−, +, +),
5∗
1,2,3 = (+, −, +);
A2; 101,2,3 = (−, +, +),
5∗
1,2,3 = (+, +, −);
A3; 101,2,3 = (−, +, +),
5∗
1,2,3 = (−, +, +).

We show, in Table 1, Z2 charges and locations in the extra two dimensions for each particles
for the case of A1. For the cases of A2 and A3, the only Z2 charges of 5∗
1,2,3 are replaced as
shown in Eq. (1).
3The choice of three −s is also anomaly free, but it can not reproduce the correct CKM matrix with a real
determinant of the down-type quark mass matrix.
4We name 101,2,3 in order of mass.
