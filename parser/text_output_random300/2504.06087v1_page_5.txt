Figure 3: Relative energies on a series of challenging strongly-correlated systems. a) Energy deviations versus
CCSD(T) for non-covalent interaction energies of 11 systems of the S22 dataset [20, 21]. b) Detailed comparison
of benzene dimer interaction energy across methods. c) Singlet-triplet energy gap in n-acene from naphthalene
to hexacene.
d) n-acene energy gap error to ZPVE corrected experimental results [22–26].
Shaded region
corresponds to typical experimental uncertainty: ±1 kcal/mol for S22 (a) and acenes (c-d), and experimental
uncertainty for benzene dimer (b).
Organometallic compounds
Organometallic com-
pounds are of interest due to their widespread use
in catalysis.
However, their description is compu-
tationally challenging: methods, such as MRCI and
CCSD(T), are either too costly to be applied in suffi-
ciently large basis sets or require additional correction
terms for an accurate assessment.
As a first example, we compute the ionization poten-
tial (IP) of chloroferrocene, a known failure case of
DFT [35]. Like the singlet-triplet gaps, we set the FiRE
cutoff to c = 3a0 because the system composes only
short bond lengths. The convergence of the IP in the
number of optimization steps is visualized in Fig. 4a.
FiRE converges to an energy gap of 256.5 mEh close to
the experimental results of 258 mEh [36]. This agree-
ment is unmatched by various other methods, e.g.,
DFT with B3LYP [37] deviates by 20 mEh, and 15 mEh
with the PBE0 functional. CCSD(T) in a ccpvDZ ba-
sis – the largest CCSD(T) calculation we could afford
– underestimates the IP by 13 mEh, and the DLPNO-
CCSD(T) approximation in the complete basis set
limit (CBS) deviates by 8 mEh. Only when combin-
ing DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS energies with a CCSD(T)
correction at the DZ level (denoted as CCSD(T)/FPA)
do the energies match FiRE’s accuracy.
Even more challenging is the protonation of the
iron-sulfur complex [HFe2S(CH2)(SCH3)4]3–, which has
been studied as a model system for catalysis in nitro-
genase [38]. This iron-sulfur complex has four compet-
ing binding sites for an added proton: HC, HS, HFe,
and HFe2. Zhai et al. [38] found that even CCSD(T)
in the complete basis set limit (CBS) is insufficient to
resolve the energy differences between these binding
sites at chemical accuracy. Their final best estimate is
a compound estimate, requiring a relativistic coupled
cluster calculation, perturbative triplets, CBS extrap-
olation, and estimation of multireference effects based
on a separate DMRG calculation.
Omitting any of
these corrections substantially increases the error, as
depicted in Fig. 4b.
