tures are generally very unstable. Therefore, a strategic
solution is required to achieve a balance between keep-
ing the band gap at an optimal value and enhancing the
stability of the material simultaneously. In addition to
iodide perovskites, bromide-based and mixed-halide ar-
chitectures have also been extensively researched as out-
standing alternatives to satisfy the conditions of achiev-
ing photovoltaic efficiency with long-term stability. As a
demonstration, PbBr−
3 is generally more thermally and
humid-stable than PbI−
3
2. Substitution of I−ions with
Br−ions results in the decrease of lattice parameters due
to the smaller radius of Br−ion, which has the potential
to increase stability. The calculated structural data are
listed in Table I.
The contrast between MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 shows
dramatic structural and electronic modifications due to
the substitution of iodine with bromine. For MAPbBr3,
the unit cell parameters (a = 5.96 ˚A, b = 5.96 ˚A, c =
5.99 ˚A) are considerably smaller than those for MAPbI3
(a = 6.36 ˚A, b = 6.33 ˚A, c = 6.37 ˚A). This contraction of
the perovskite lattice is consistent with the smaller ionic
radius of Br−compared to I−. Additionally, the 3.03 ˚A
Pb–Br bond length is shorter than that of the 3.22 ˚A Pb–
I bond, and the 2.47 ˚A H–Br bond length is shorter than
the 2.71 ˚A H–I bond length. These differences indicate a
tighter hydrogen-halide interaction and a tighter crystal
structure for the bromide perovskite.
Electronically, MAPbBr3 possesses a larger valence
band maximum (VBM) of 2.8141 eV over 2.1799 eV for
MAPbI3, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) is
larger as well (4.7151 eV for MAPbBr3 vs 3.7387 eV
for MAPbI3). Consequently, the band gap is enlarged
from 1.5588 eV in MAPbI3 to 1.9010 eV in MAPbBr3.
Moreover, the electron effective mass is increased from
0.254 to 0.268 and the hole effective mass is altered from
0.232 in MAPbI3 to 0.222 in MAPbBr3, which means
bromine substitution influences both the band alignment
and charge carrier dynamics, and hence the material’s
optoelectronic properties.
A similar trend is observed in the comparison of
SbH4PbI3 and SbH4PbBr3. The lattice parameters for
SbH4PbBr3 (a = 5.84 ˚A, b = 5.91 ˚A, c = 5.96 ˚A) are
distinctly smaller than those of SbH4PbI3 (a = 6.23 ˚A,
b = 6.30 ˚A, c = 6.36 ˚A), further confirming the contrac-
tion due to the smaller size of Br−. The Pb–Br bond
length in SbH4PbBr3 is 2.96 ˚A, which is shorter than the
Pb–I bond length of 3.14 ˚A in SbH4PbI3, and the H–
Br bond length (2.75 ˚A) is also less than the H–I bond
length (2.94 ˚A). Electronics of SbH4PbBr3 are similarly
affected: its VBM is 3.6940 eV compared to 2.9328 eV
in SbH4PbI3, and the CBM rises from 4.3003 eV in
SbH4PbI3 to 5.4169 eV in SbH4PbBr3. This results in
an increased band gap from 1.3675 eV in SbH4PbI3 to
1.7229 eV in SbH4PbBr3, indicating a stronger quantum
confinement effect with bromine incorporation. Further-
more, the effective masses of both electrons and holes in-
crease, with the electron effective mass rising from 0.215
to 0.289 and the hole effective mass increasing from 0.164
to 0.182. These variations emphasize that bromine sub-
stitution not only alters the band alignment but also
modulates the charge carrier transport properties, which
can significantly affect the material’s optoelectronic per-
formance.

of
MAPbBr3 and SbH4PbBr3.
When comparing the
MAPbBr3 and SbH4PbBr3 structures, the lattice param-
eters are very similar, with only a slight contraction in the
a parameter observed upon substituting MA+ with SbH+
4
(Table I). Such subtle differences in hydrogen-bonding in-
teractions, where MA+ forms N–H· · ·Br bonds and SbH+
4
establishes additional H· · ·Br contacts, are also reflected
in the electronic structures. The DOS of both materials
shows a valence band predominantly composed of Br−
states and a conduction band dominated by Pb states
(Figure 5). As can be seen in Figure 6, the minimum
band gap is located at the R symmetry point, and the
nature of the transition is direct in both structures. Re-
placing the MA+ cation with the SbH+
4 cation in the
PbI−
3 inorganic framework narrows the band gap, result-
ing in a more suitable value of 1.36 eV. However, when
the PbI−
3 anion is replaced with the PbBr−
3 anion to en-
hance stability, the band gap increases from 1.36 eV to
1.72 eV, as shown in Table II. This indicates that a fine-
tuning process is necessary to optimize both electronic
properties and stability.
A suitable strategy would be
the gradual substitution of Br−ions with I−ions.
The
optimized
structure
of
MAPbBr2I
and
SbH4PbBr2I are presented in Figure 7 and relative
data for such structure are in Table I. Lattice param-
eters a = 5.96, b = 5.96, and c = 5.99 ˚A, Pb–Br and
H–Br bond lengths 3.03 ˚A and 2.47 ˚A, respectively.
Substitution of a Br−by an I−to form MAPbBr2I
increases the c-axis to 6.362 ˚A and causes a and b to
be little changed. The substitution adds a Pb–I bond
of 3.20 ˚A and an H–I bond of 2.60 ˚A, as might be
expected of I−’s increased ionic radius and localized
structural impact. The same holds true for SbH4PbBr3,
whose lattice parameters are a = 5.84, b = 5.91, and
c = 5.96 ˚A, and whose Pb–Br and H–Br bond distances
are 2.96 ˚A and 2.75 ˚A, respectively. If one Br−is sub-
stituted by an I−to form SbH4PbBr2I, the c parameter
increases to 6.287 ˚A, while a and b increase very slightly
(a = 5.883 ˚A, b = 5.936 ˚A). The Pb–I bond length in
SbH4PbBr2I is also slightly shorter (3.15 ˚A) than in
MAPbBr2I (3.20 ˚A), while the Pb–Br bond is close to
its original value (2.97 ˚A versus 3.03 ˚A in MAPbBr2I).
The hydrogen-bonding arrangement is also severely
altered, with H–I and H–Br bond lengths increasing to
2.86 ˚A and 2.82 ˚A, respectively, in SbH4PbBr2I, from
the respective 2.60 ˚A and 2.41 ˚A in MAPbBr2I. Both
complexes preserve the perovskite structure, with Pb
coordinated to the halide anions.
The electronic properties of the perovskite materials
MAPbBr3, MAPbBr2I, SbH4PbBr3, and SbH4PbBr2I
have been examined with particular interest in the ef-
fects of halide substitution and A-site cation change.
