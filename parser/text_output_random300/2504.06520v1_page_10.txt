The SWS map for each frequency was estimated using the AIA approach. For 500 Hz and 
1000 Hz, an autocorrelation window size of 7.9 mm × 7.9 mm was used, whereas a smaller 
window size of 4.9 mm × 4.9 mm was applied for higher frequencies (1500 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 
2500 Hz). A larger autocorrelation window was generally used to ensure uniform SWS 
estimates, particularly for lower frequencies, due to their longer wavelengths. Figure 8 
illustrates the estimated SWS at different frequencies, where a slight increase in SWS with 
increasing frequency was observed, indicating low dispersion behavior in the phantom.

Fig. 8. The 3D SWS map estimated using MFR-OCE on a 5% gelatin phantom across different 
excitation frequencies: (a) 500 Hz, (b) 1000 Hz, (c) 1500 Hz, (d) 2000 Hz, and (e) 2500 Hz. 
The plot in Fig. 9 displays the mean SWS as a function of frequency (black data points), 
along with a power law fitting (black trendline). The power law fit of SWS has an exponent of 
0.13, indicating that the phantom exhibits non-purely elastic behavior with a viscosity 
component. This viscosity is likely attributed to the 3% concentration of intralipid powder 
added to the phantom for optical scattering purposes. Additionally, the mean SWS estimated 
from the reverberant shear wave field in the phantom at three single-frequency experiments 
(i.e., 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz, and 2000 Hz) is presented in Fig. 9 (orange data points). The power 
law exponent for these single-frequency excitations was found to be 0.12. The close agreement 
between the mean SWS values from the multi-frequency and single-frequency experiments 
across all three frequencies, with a less than 3% difference, validates the accuracy of shear 
wave field extraction in the MFR-OCE experiment.
