ran over 40 years ago, is still able to set some of the most stringent constraints on the
electrophilic ALP models, especially for high ALP masses. However, the bounds set by
NA64, both in its visible and invisible modes, complement those by E137, particularly for
higher values of the coupling. This is particularly relevant in the pseudoscalar case, where
these additional constraints cover all the otherwise unconstrained regions for ALP masses
below 10 MeV and couplings above 10−2 GeV−1. While most of the parameter space under
consideration is now covered for the derivative case, this is not the case in the pseudoscalar
one. In particular, the absence of constraints coming from LEP and W + decays leave the
large coupling region for an ALP mass above ∼200 MeV unconstrained. To determine the
viable parameter regions of smaller couplings, it would be desirable to perform a detailed
calculation of the constraints from SNe for pseudoscalar couplings, including the effect of
loop-induced couplings to photons.
Moving onto Scenario M, for which bounds are shown in figure 11, we observe, as ex-
pected, that the strongest constraints come from NA64µ, which is exceptionally well suited
