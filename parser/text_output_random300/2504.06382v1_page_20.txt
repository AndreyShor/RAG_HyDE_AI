where the function α(z, x) characterizes the geometry along the normal ˆn2

At each surface ∂Σϵ located at z = ϵ (see Fig. 1), the set of vectors (n2, n3) and (ˆn2, ˆn3)
can be connected through the transformations
n2 = A(z, x)ˆn2 + A⊥(z, x)ˆn3 ,
(4.57)
n3 = −A⊥(z, x)ˆn2 + A(z, x)ˆn3 ,
(4.58)
where the coefficients satisfy the orthogonality condition
A2(z, x) + A⊥(z, x)2 = 1 .
(4.59)
The fact Σ is orthogonally anchored to ∂M, is translated into the boundary conditions
A⊥(0, x) = 0 ,
A(0, x) = 1 ,
(4.60)
which imply that the normal vectors (ˆn2, ˆn3) coincide with (n2, n3) at z = 0.
At this point, one needs to perform the asymptotic analysis for the behavior of the
co-dimension 2 conformal invariants which enter in the energy functional (4.50). For the
the term involving the traceless part of the extrinsic curvature, i.e.,
PµνP µν = KA

(4.61)
one may notice that, in the static case, K(1)
µν = 0. Hence, one may denote K(2)
µν = Kµν for
simplicity, that is cast in the form
Kµν = γα
