Local approximations (the LCFA and LMA) were de-
rived for the spin-polarisation density matrix of the pro-
duced pair and benchmarked with values calculated di-
rectly from QED. Although there was in general good
agreement in the intensity regimes in which these approx-
imations are expected to be valid, it was again demon-
strated (as has been noted in e.g. [93] and [105]) that the
LCFA failed to fully capture the physics in a circularly-
polarised background.
The results can be used to de-
termine the experimental parameters for which these lo-
cal approximations can be employed in numerical simula-
tions of particles scattering in intense EM fields. In turn,
this may help us understand what effect entanglement
has on more complicated strong-field processes, such as
the development of QED cascades.
Recent developments in particle physics phenomenol-
ogy have led to the measurement of entanglement at
high energies; our work opens the door to probing entan-
glement in electromagnetic backgrounds at high intensi-
ties. The measurement of entanglement at high-intensity
would provide a new test of quantum field theory, poten-
tially shedding light on new physics effects. One applica-
tion of our results is in ghost imaging [106] in which an
idler particle is used to gain information about a target
without directly interacting with it, by being entangled
with another particle that probes the target.
The approach we have outlined in the current paper
can be further used to study other strong-field QED pro-
cesses, in particular higher-order processes that could
lead to entanglement of larger numbers of particles. It
would also be important to consider more real-world ef-
fects that would be present in any experimental realisa-
tion, such as the method chosen for spin measurement
and the influence of laser focussing.

Light-front spin quantization axis
One can define a covariant spin basis vector: lightfront helicity,

p = pµ
m −m
k · pkµ ,

in the lab reference, corresponding to the spin quantization axis
n =
p+ + m
p+(p0 + m)(p1, p2, p3 + m p0 + m
p+ + m) ,
(A2)
antiparallel to the laser propagating direction in the particle rest frame, and where p+ = p0 + p3 = k · p/k0. For a
positron, the momentum pµ should be replaced with qµ.
