Figure 4. The electron-positron spin entanglement’s depen-
dence on the photon energy parameter η in a 4-cycle, circu-
larly polarised (c = +1) laser background with ξ = 2. Fig.
(a) contains the dependence of fully polarised photons with
Γ3 = ±1 and fig.
(b) for partially polarised photons with
−1 < Γ3 < 1.
Fig.
(c) is a plot of the total probability
where the perturbative contribution from the pulse envelope
is clearly visible, here for η ≲0.05. The collision energy pa-
rameter η changes from 0.03 to 25, with the corresponding
change in photon energy (for a laser frequency of 1.55 eV),
from 2.7 GeV to 100 GeV, shown on the top axis in (a). The
magenta dashed line in Fig. (b) indicates a region in which
C = 0.
pairs with much larger concurrence than those created
by photons polarised perpendicular to the laser polarisa-
tion (Γ1 = −1). For the parallel polarisation case we find
C(0.5) = 0.92 while for perpendicular polarised case we
find C(0.5) = 0.07. Any significant degree of entangle-
ment requires the incident photon to be highly polarised
with Γ1 ≈1, with the magenta dashed lines in Fig. 5 (b)
again outlining regions where the concurrence is exactly
zero.
The variation of the spin entanglement with intensity
ξ of a linearly-polarised background is shown in Fig. 6.
Three different regimes can be identified, just as in the
case of a circularly-polarised background, however there
are important differences. In the plot for the two photon
polarisation eigenstates, Fig. 6(a), it can be seen that
the concurrence in the perturbative regime is similar to
the circularly-polarised case (the concurrence C = 0.52
for Γ1 = −1 and C = 0.45 for Γ1 = +1). However, as
the intensity is increased to the intermediate regime, the
concurrence varies significantly and actually increases in

collides head-on with photons of energy parameter η = 0.2.
Fig. (a) contains the dependence of fully polarised photons
with Γ1 = ±1 and fig.

with −1 < Γ1 < 1. The probability spectra from fully po-
larised photons with Γ1 = ±1 are also given in (a) with the

the Γ1 = +1 eigenstate to a maximum of C = 0.9 at
ξ = 0.8 whilst the concurrence falls in the Γ1 = −1
eigenstate. In the high intensity regime, the relative en-
tanglement of the two polarisation eigenstates switches
sign; the concurrence of the Γ1 = +1 decreases mono-
tonically (at ξ = 100, C = 0) whereas the concurrence
of the Γ1 = −1 eigenstate increases monotonically (at
ξ = 100, C ≈0.39). Similar to the circularly polarised
background case, the strongest entanglement is created
with the highly polarised photons |Γ1| ≈1, as shown
in Fig. 6 (b). However, different to the circular polar-
isation case, there is an island of high entanglement at
0.5 ≲ξ ≲5 for photons mostly polarised in the Γ1 = +1
eigenstate, providing an example of how a highly entan-
gled pair can be created in the non-perturbative ξ ̸≪1
regime.
The variation of concurrence with energy for fixed in-
tensity ξ = 2 is shown in Fig. 7, where again a per-
turbative η ≲0.05, an intermediate and a high-energy
regime can be noted. In fact, there is a strong similarity
with the intensity plots in Fig. 6. An important differ-
ence in the linearly polarised case can be seen in Fig. 7
(a); in the intermediate energy regime the concurrence
changes markedly from the linear regime and increases
for the photon polarisation Γ1 = +1, parallel to the laser
field, while decreasing for the perpendicular polarisation
Γ1 = −1. The maximum concurrence of approximately
C = 0.91 is hence found at η = 0.075, corresponding
to 6.4 GeV for a laser frequency of 1.55 eV. As the en-
ergy parameter is increased still further into the high
