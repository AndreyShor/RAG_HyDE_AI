to be the condensible algebra on our physical boundary.
Gauging Rep(D4) with (γa,γb,γc) = (−1,1,1) corresponds to changing the sym-
metry boundary condition to 1⊕eG ⊕eR ⊕eRG ⊕2mB; this is the Rep(D4) gauging
‘without discrete torsion’, i.e. the one which is dual to gauging the entire D4 sym-
metry. The other two gaugings, with (γa,γb,γc) equal to (1,−1,1) and (1,1,−1),
correspond to the symmetry boundary conditions 1 ⊕eB ⊕eG ⊕eGB ⊕2mR and
1 ⊕eB ⊕eR ⊕eRB ⊕2mG, respectively.
These are dual to gauging the Z2 × Z2
subgroups of D4 with discrete torsion turned on. By examining which anyons are
condensed on both boundaries we see that, given our choice (7.3) for the physical
boundary, we expect the (−1,1,1) gauging to produce a theory with four ground
states and the other two gaugings to produce theories with two ground states.
We can conﬁrm this by looking at the behavior of the partition function.
Given the trivial action of the Z2 × Z2 subgroup, we expect the partial traces
of the Rep(D4) obifold to map to partial traces of a Z2 orbifold, as Z2 is the only
eﬀectively-acting symmetry present. Letting g be the generator of that eﬀective
Z2, it must be the case that the elements {1,a,b,c} of Rep(D4) map to the iden-
tity in Z2, with the only non-trivial element coming from m →g +g. Letting i,j,k
stand for any of {a,b,c}, the Rep(D4) traces map to Z2 orbifold partial traces as
follows:
Z1
1,1 →Z1,1,
Zi
1,i →Z1,1,
Zi
i,1 →Z1,1,
Z1
i,i →Z1,1,
Zk
i,j →−Z1,1,
(7.4)
Zm
1,m →2Z1,g,
Zm
m,1 →2Zg,1,
Z1
m,m →2Zg,g,
Zm
a,m →−2Z1,g,
Zm
m,a →−2Zg,1,
Za
m,m →−2Zg,g,
Zm
b,m →2Z1,g,
Zm
m,b →2Zg,1,
Zb
m,m →2Zg,g,
Zm
c,m →2Z1,g,
Zm
m,c →2Zg,1,
Zc
m,m →2Zg,g.
The coeﬃcients here can be determined by imposing consistency with the case
where the remaining Z2 acts trivially (hence all of Rep(D4) acts trivially), and
demanding that the result match with [25, section 5.4.2], [26] (after ﬁxing to the
appropriate gauge). Plugging (7.4) into (7.2) produces
Z(γa,γb,γc) = 2Z1,1 + (γb + γc)(Z1,g + Zg,1 + Zg,g).
(7.5)
This result is consisent with the SymTFT calculations: the choice (γa,γb,γc) =
(−1,1,1) produces
Z(−1,1,1) = 2(Z1,1 + Z1,g + Zg,1 + Zg,g),
(7.6)
which is the sum of four copies of a Z2 orbifold partition function. Similarly, either
of (1,−1,1) or (1,1,−1) produces
Z(+1,∓1,±1) = 2Z1,1,
