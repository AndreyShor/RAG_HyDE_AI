tions slightly increase performance but demand more com-
putational resources.
Population Size. Fig. 14 and Fig. 15 show a minor performance
boost when increasing the population size, but the gains do not
justify the substantial rise in computational costs. Generally, allo-
cating resources to run more generations may be more beneficial
than increasing population size.
Adaptive Mutation. Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 illustrate that adaptive
mutation reduces variance but tends to yield lower overall fitness.
Although it balances exploration and exploitation by altering rates

Figure 17: Impact of adaptive mutation on deletion. Similar
patterns of reduced variability coincide with reduced fitness.
in response to population diversity and convergence, those adjust-
ments appear to curb performance. A well-tuned static rate often
suffices and may simplify implementation while producing stronger
final results.

CONCLUSION
This work investigated how different mutation strategies affect
GA performance in quantum state preparation. We conducted ex-
tensive experiments in a highly parameterized quantum circuit
environment, concluding that the swap, deletion strategy generates
optimized quantum circuits with the greatest efficiency.
