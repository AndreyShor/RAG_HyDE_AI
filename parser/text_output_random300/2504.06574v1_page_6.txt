Figure 4: Statistically significant (0.1%) quadratic effect of each model parameter on the number of passes. The
value of 0 on y-axis corresponds to the reference value which is the prediction of the fitted regression model (9)
when all the parameters assume their sample average values within the simulated dataset. Each panel shows
the predicted deviation in the number of passes from the reference value against the change in a parameter
value (x-axis), when the other parameters are kept at their means. We refer readers to ‘Sensitivity analysis’ in
Methods section for methodological details.
