for a commuting pair g,h ∈Γ and z ∈K. The phases β weight the sectors in the
list above, so tthat they are no longer equal. For example,
gz
h
= β(π(h),z)(g
h
),
g
hz
= β(π(g),z)−1 (g
h
),

for π ∶Γ →G = Γ/K the projection, where we have used the fact that an element
β ∈H1(G, ˆK) is equivalent to a map
β ∶G × K Ð→U(1).
(2.12)
Let us describe these phases explicitly in the case of an anomalous Z2 ex-
tended to Z4 described in section 2.2. Because the K = Z2 subgroup of Γ = Z4 is
trivially-acting, we can identify Z4 partial traces with the torus partial traces of
the underlying eﬀectively-acting Z2. In this case, we let β be the (only) nontrivial
element of
H1(Z4/Z2, ˆZ2) ≅Z2.

Let m,n ∈{0,⋯,3}, then we can describe these phases explicitly in partial traces
Zm,n as illustrated in table 1, where
Zm,n = m
n
.
(2.14)
We can understand these phases at the level of diagrams decorated by topo-
logical defect lines (TDLs) by using the (non-trivial) local operators bound to the
trivially-acting symmetry lines. This procedure requires pulling the local opera-
tors through the lines for the eﬀectively-acting symmetry, and here is where the
phases from above enter, as the crossing of these operators may generate a phase.
We will describe such alternative approaches to these ‘quantum symmetry’ phases
in examples in sections 6.2.2, 6.4.
So far we have brieﬂy reviewed the anomaly resolution construction for ordinary
groups. Next, we turn to constructions for more general cases.

General case: SymTFT construction
First, let us explain what we mean by resolving a (not-necessarily-invertible)
anomalous symmetry in the language of SymTFTs. For a given anomalous global
symmetry, labeled by a fusion category D, its resolution corresponds to embedding
the D-symmetric theory into a larger non-anomalous symmetry as an intrinsically
gapless SPT (igSPT) phase. The notion of an igSPT phase is introduced in [10]
and is deﬁned as follows.
