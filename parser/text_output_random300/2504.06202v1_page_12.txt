Figure 3.2: Exploration process 2. The red curve is ℓ([0, t1]). The brown curve is bγ.
Let us now turn to the interior case. For this purpose, we consider the following Markovian
exploration of Γ.
Exploration process 2. See Figure 3.2 for an illustration. Let ℓbe a curve which first goes from
−i to −ri in a straight vertical line, and then follows the circle ∂Br in the clockwise direction.
We trace every loop in Γ that ℓencounters in the counterclockwise direction, in the order that ℓ
encounters them. We stop this exploration the first time that we reach Br/2, namely we stop at a
time that we are tracing along a loop γ that intersects Br/2, exactly at the moment that γ reaches
∂Br/2, so that we have discovered a piece bγ of γ. If none of the loops in Γ intersect both ∂Br
and ∂Br/2, then we stop this process at the time that we have discovered all the loops in Γ that
intersect [−i, −ri] ∪∂Br.
On the event E1 that there exists a loop in Γ which intersects both ∂Br and ∂Br/2, we define γ
and bγ just as above. Let t1 be the first time (according to the parametrization of ℓ) that ℓintersects
γ. Let a := ℓ(t1). Let b be the other endpoint of bγ. Let K(t1) be the union of ℓ((0, t1)) together
with all the loops in Γ that ℓ((0, t1)) intersects. Let U be the connected component containing 0
of D \ K(t1) ∪bγ. Let f be the unique conformal map from U onto D with f(0) = 0 and f(a) = i.
Let Σ be the σ-algebra generated by E1, bγ and by all the loops in Γ that ℓ((0, t1)) intersects.
Note that f and U are measurable w.r.t. Σ. Conditionally on Σ and on E1, the image of γ \ bγ
under f is a chordal SLEκ in D between f(a) and f(b), which we denote by eγ.
Proof of Proposition 3.2, interior case. We perform Exploration process 2 for Γ, and use the nota-
tions there. We work on the event E1. By the Schwarz lemma, we have 1 ≤f′(0) ≤2/r. By the
Koebe 1/4 theorem, we have
Bε/4 ⊆f(Bε) ⊆B8ε/r.

Let E2 be the event that eγ intersects Bε/4. If both E1 and E2 hold, then A2(ε, r) occurs. Therefore
