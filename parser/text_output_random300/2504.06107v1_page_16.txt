SUMMARY
In the field of hadron physics, the study of novel ex-
otic states is a central research focus. Inspired by the
observed T +
cc(3875), this study focuses on the doubly-
charmed hexaquark system (cc[qq][qq]). We replace the
two antiquarks ¯q in the T +
cc(3875) (cc¯q¯q) state with two
strongly correlated light diquarks [qq], and conduct an
in-depth study within the diquark picture.
In this research, we first construct total wave func-
tions that satisfy the Spin-Statistics Theorem, covering
the flavor, spatial, color, and spin parts. Then, within the
framework of the constituent quark model, we systemat-
ically calculated the mass spectra of the doubly-charmed
hexaquark system using the Gaussian expansion method.
Finally, through detailed calculations, we also obtained
corresponding internal mass contributions, root-mean-
square radii, two-body strong decay partial widths, and
total decay widths.
The mass spectra of the doubly-charmed hexaquark
system are in the range of 5000–6000 MeV, and the
analysis of the mass spectra shows that there is no sta-
ble state in this system. All states can decay into two
final-state singly-charmed baryons through two-body re-
arrangement strong decay.
The analysis of the inter-
nal mass contributions shows that the contributions of
the kinetic energy and the confinement potential are of
the same order of magnitude, while the contribution of
the hyperfine interaction potential is suppressed and rel-
atively small, leading to low configuration mixing and
small mass gaps between certain configurations, result-
ing in partner states.
Regarding the RMS radii, most results are in the range
of 1.2-1.6 fm, roughly in the same order of magnitude.
This implies that the spatial distribution between quarks
is relatively close and the internal interactions within the
system are strong, which is consistent with the expecta-
tions of the compact doubly-charmed hexaquark config-
uration.
After that, we deeply analyzed the decay behavior of
the doubly-charmed hexaquark system. The analysis in-
dicates that most observed states possess total decay
widths ranging from 30 to 100 MeV. However, there are
still some narrow states. Even though these states gen-
erally have a large two-body decay phase space, the total
widths of some of them are even less than 10 MeV. Upon
further investigation of the reason, we found that for
some specific decay channels, the signs of the Feynman
amplitudes M(A →BC) from the four quark-exchange
diagrams are opposite. This causes their contributions to
largely cancel each other out, ultimately leading to the
suppression of the decay width.
In
the
doubly-charmed
hexaquark
system,
the
Hc2[nn]2(5043, 0, 0+) state is an ideal candidate for ex-
perimental detection. Composed of two scalar [nn] di-
quarks (I = 0, S = 0), its structure enhances the internal
confinement potential and chromomagnetic interaction,
resulting in the lowest mass (5043 MeV) in the mass spec-
trum. It mainly decays to the ΛcΛc final state with a to-
tal width of 14.3 MeV, with a narrow hadronic resonance
characteristic.
Given the experimental detectability of
doubly-charmed multi-quark systems confirmed by the
discovery of T +
cc(3875), we suggest the LHCb, CMS, AT-
LAS collaborations to analyze the ΛcΛc invariant mass
spectrum in the 5000–5100 MeV range in high-luminosity
pp collisions to search for this state.
Furthermore,
several
narrow
states
also
show
great
potential
for
experimental
detection.
The
Hc2[nn][ns](5482, 1/2, 0+) state in the cc[nn][ns] subsys-
tem has a total width of less than 5 MeV and decays
only to ΛcΞ′
c, with high detectability in the 5400-5500
MeV window.
The Hc2[nn][ss](5586, 0, 0+) state in the
cc[nn][ss] subsystem has a total width of about 7 MeV
and decays only to ΛcΩc.
It may form a resonance
peak in the 5500-5600 MeV range of the ΛcΩc invariant
mass spectrum.
The Hc2[ns]2(5828, 1, 1+) state in the
cc[ns][ns] subsystem has a total width of less than 10
MeV and its dominant decay channel is Ξ∗
cΞ′
c, showing
distinct lineshape compared to the background in the
5800-5900 MeV range.
In summary, these results comprehensively reveal the
mass spectra, internal structures, and decay characteris-
tics of doubly-charmed hexaquark states. We hope they
can provide some perspectives for further theoretical re-
search. Meanwhile, we also look forward to more exper-
imental collaborations focusing on doubly-charmed hex-
aquark states in the future. Conducting more experimen-
tal measurements can not only test our research results,
but also deepen the understanding of the interactions
within multi-quark systems.
