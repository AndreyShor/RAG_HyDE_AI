where we also used the fact that min{|Dg1(1)|, |Dg2(1)|} ≥|Dg1(1/2)|. Therefore, proceeding
similarly to the above, we obtain that

To conclude, it remains to handle (B.5). For this term, it suffices to show that Ez[∆(g1, g2)4]1/4 ≲

∞, which follows from some elementary computations.

We collect here some well-known results on Gaussian fields. In all the subsequent lemmas, we assume
D ⊆Rd to be a bounded domain. We begin with the well known Cameron–Martin theorem [CM44].
Lemma C.1. Consider an almost surely continuous centred Gaussian field (X(x))x∈D and a real-
valued random variable Z belonging to the L2 closure of the vector space spanned by {X(x)}x∈D.
Let F : C(D) →R be a bounded measurable functional. Then the following equality holds

= E[F(X(·) + E[X(·)Z])] .
We have the following standard concentration inequality for Gaussian fields which is known as
Borell-TIS inequality. We refer to [AT07, Theorem 2.1.1] for a proof.
Lemma C.2. Consider an almost surely continuous centred Gaussian field (X(x))x∈D. Then it holds

We now state Fernique’s majorizing criterion, and we refer to [AT07, Theorem 1.3.3] for a proof.
Lemma C.3. Consider an almost surely continuous centred Gaussian field (X(x))x∈D. Consider the
pseudometric on D defined as follows
dX(x, y) :=
p
E[|X(x) −X(y)|2],
∀x, y ∈D .
Then there exists a universal constant C such that for any probability measure σ on D,
