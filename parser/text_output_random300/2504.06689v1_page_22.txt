corrections for electroweak Higgs production (i.e. including both the V H and VBF processes)
have been matched to parton showers in Ref. [572].
The current experimental error on the H+ ≥2j cross section is on the order of 25% [532],
again dominated by statistical errors, and again for the diphoton final state, by the fit statistical
error. With the same assumptions as above, for 3000 fb−1, the statistical error will reduce to the
order of 3.5%. If the systematic errors remain the same, at approximately 12% (in this case the
largest systematic error is from the jet energy scale uncertainty and the jet energy resolution
uncertainty), a total uncertainty of approximately 12.5% would result, less than the current
theoretical uncertainty. To achieve a theoretical uncertainty less than this value would require
the calculation of H+ ≥2j to NNLOHTL ⊗NLOQCD in the gluon fusion production mode.

LH21 status: The total cross section is known at N3LOQCD [473]. Inclusive NNLOQCD correc-
tions are available in VH@NNLO [573–575], and soft-gluon resummation effects are known [576].
NNLOQCD differential results are known for WH [207] and ZH [209]; matched to parton shower
using the MiNLO procedure in Ref. [577, 578]; supplemented with NNLL’ resummation in the
0-jettiness variable and matched to a parton shower within the GENEVA Monte Carlo framework
in Ref. [579]. In this last reference, H →b¯b decays were included at LO through the parton
shower. NLOQCD corrections to the H →b¯b decay are available in MCFM [253], using massive
b-quarks. The consistent combination of NNLOQCD corrections to V H production and H →b¯b
decay were presented in Refs. [144,292,580], where the first of these studies considered ZH and
W +H production, the second considered W −H production, and the third considered all three
processes W ±H and ZH. All of these calculations employed massless b-quarks in the decay.
Bottom quark mass effects in NNLOQCD corrections to pp →W +H(→b¯b) production were
presented in Ref. [344]. NNLOQCD predictions for pp →ZH(→b¯b) and pp →W ±H(→b¯b)
were matched to a parton shower using the MiNNLO method in Ref. [581], for massive b-quarks.
NLOEW corrections calculated [582–585] also including parton shower effects [585]. The process
b¯b →ZH in the 5FS, but with a non-vanishing bottom-quark Yukawa coupling, was investigated
in the soft-virtual approximation at NNLOQCD [586]. The polarised q¯q →ZH amplitudes were
studied at NNLOQCD in Ref. [587]. The loop-induced gg →ZH channel accounts for ∼10%
of the total cross section and contributes significantly to the pp →ZH theoretical uncertainty.
The NLOHTL results reweighted by the full LO cross section were presented in Ref. [588]; finite
mt effects at NLOQCD known in a 1/mt expansion [589]; threshold resummation calculated in
Ref. [590]. The NLO virtual amplitudes were computed in a small-pT expansion [591], high-
energy expansion [592], and numerically [593]. The complete NLO corrections were recently
presented in Ref. [594] (based on a small-mH, mZ expansion), in Ref. [595] (based on a com-
bination of the numerical results and high-energy expansion), and in Ref. [596] (based on a
combination of the small-pT and high-energy expansion [597]). NLOQCD with dimension-six
Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) operators investigated [598], matched to a
parton shower in the Madgraph5_aMC@NLO framework. Higgs pseudo-observables investi-
gated at NLOQCD [599]. Anomalous HV V couplings were studied at NNLOQCD for W ±H and
ZH in Ref. [600]. In the SMEFT, a NNLOQCD event generator for pp →Z(→l¯l)H(→b¯b) was
presented in Ref. [601].
The process pp →W +H(→W +W −) with a subsequent leptonic decay of the two W +
bosons and the hadronic decay of the W −was considered in Ref. [602] as a contribution to the
µ+νµe+νejj final state. Full NLOQCD +NLOEW corrections have been calculated. In addition,
the NLOQCD corrections, matched to the SHERPA parton shower, as well as virtual NLOEW cor-
rections, are presented in this reference. The NNLOQCD corrections to V H production, matched
