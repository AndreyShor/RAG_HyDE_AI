From the experimental perspective, this model can be viewed as a generalization of the
previous model of 40K-6Li mixture to cases when an additional 6Li atom in a different
hyperfine state is present in the system. The parameter G controls interactions between the
additional particle with the two-component system. We aim to examine the performance of
the control protocol for different values of G. Particularly, we want to answer the question
if in the presence of interactions with a third-component particle, we are able to obtain
the desired target state of two components by optimizing solely interactions within this
subsystem.
We assume that at the beginning the system is prepared in the non-interacting ground
state, i.e., it can be written as a product state |Ψ(0)⟩= |ini⟩|Φ0⟩, where |ini⟩is the initial
state of two-component mixture exactly as considered before while |Φ0⟩is the lowest single-
particle orbital describing third component particle in its harmonic trap. The evolution of a
whole system is governed by the Hamiltonian (6) and thus its quantum state |Ψ(t)⟩evolves
according to the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. To have a full correspondence to the
previously studied cases, we demand that at the final instant, T the state of the system is as
close as possible to the product state |Ψ(T)⟩= |tar⟩|Φ(T)⟩. In this way we demand that the
two-component subsystem is driven by optimized protocol to a desired target state |tar⟩,
the state of the third-component particle is arbitrary, and there are no correlations between
these two subsystems. Since during the evolution, the state of the system is not necessarily
a product state, we will calculate all temporal properties of the two-component subsystem
from its reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out the third-component particle

To get a better comparison with previously studied two-component scenarios, let us focus on
the simplest generalization of a previous case with the target interaction g2 = 1 and allowed
range of control field g ∈[−0.5, 0.5]. We will check the performance of the optimization
method for different strengths of interactions.
In the top row of Fig. 6 we show the
results obtained for this scenario, assuming protocol duration T = 3ω−1, for three different
interactions G. In the left plot, we display optimized time dependence of the control field
g(t) while in the right plot the temporal fidelity F(t) is presented. We notice that along
