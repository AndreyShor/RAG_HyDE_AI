This calculation is crucial because it systematically reduces the governing equation for the
cupular deflection into a solvable integral equation by leveraging the Laplace transform.
By transforming the original time-dependent equations, the problem is converted into
an algebraic form where the pressure gradient can be explicitly isolated, and integrated
in space to obtain the pressure jump. Furthermore, inverting the transform and applying
the convolution theorem ultimately yields an explicit time-domain equation governing the
evolution of 𝜂0. This final equation is particularly useful, as it expresses the cupular deflection
in terms of a convolution integral. This approach allows for the computation of the solution in
arbitrary domains, linking the problem to that solved in a simpler domain via the transformed
Kernel.
