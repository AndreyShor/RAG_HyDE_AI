If Fγ,t(·) were a deterministic, t-independent function, then the conclusion would follow by a direct
application of [MRV16, Proposition 4.1]. However, by following the proof of [MRV16, Proposition 4.1],
the same conclusion holds also in our more general setting by using (W1) and (W4).
For A ≥0, we introduce the quantity

(7.17)
The upshot of Lemma 7.5 is that for any ε > 0, we can find A ≥0 sufficiently large such that for any
s ≥0 sufficiently large satisfying (es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N, there exists T ≥0 sufficiently large such
that for any t ≥T and χ : [0, R]d →R satisfying the conditions in (6.6),

Therefore, in what follows we we can just focus on the expectation E(7.17) for a fixed A ≥0.

Path constraint
We now want to exclude the points m ∈[0, R]d such that Yχ
t (m) −dt ≥−A with an unlikely path
[0, t] ∋s 7→Ys(m). To this end, for A, L, z ≥0, we consider the set of functions

Lemma 7.6 ([MRV16, Lemma 5.1]). For any ε > 0 and A ≥0, there exists L ≥0 sufficiently
large such that for any s ≥0 sufficiently large satisfying (es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N, there exists T ≥0
sufficiently large such that for any t ≥T and χ : [0, R]d →R satisfying the conditions in (6.6), it
holds that
