and a ﬁshtail eﬀect are distinctive features. Therefore, we address this alloy in a
separate chapter.
To the best of our knowledge, the annealing eﬀect on Jc in HEAs has been
investigated for the ﬁrst time in this particular alloy by Gao et al[54]. A polycrys-
talline sample was prepared using the arc-melting method and subsequently annealed
at various temperatures (Ta) for 5 hours. Figure 15 presents the phase diagram of
(TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5, revealing that the bcc structure remains stable up to Ta=500
◦C. At Ta=700 ◦C, the Bragg reﬂection peaks in the X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) pattern
shift to higher angles, indicating a reduction in the lattice parameter. The authors
attribute this phenomenon to the emergence of TaNb with a bcc structure. Fur-
thermore, metallographic analysis of the sample annealed at 500 ◦C revealed the
precipitation of clusters approximately 10 nm in size. Tc=7.13 K of the as-cast sample
remains nearly unchanged after annealing. In the sample annealed at 500 ◦C, µ0Hc2(0)
is estimated to be 10.07 T, corresponding to ξGL(0) of 5.72 nm.
Figures 16(a)-(f) summarize the M-H curves, magnetic ﬁeld dependencies of Jc,
and Fp/Fp,max curves for the as-cast and 500 ◦C-annealed samples. While the as-cast
sample exhibits magnetic hysteresis loops characteristic of a conventional alloy super-
conductor, a ﬁshtail eﬀect is observed in the 500 ◦C-annealed sample at high magnetic
ﬁelds. The second peak in the magnetization shifts to higher ﬁelds and becomes more
pronounced as the temperature decreases. The self-ﬁeld Jc of the sample annealed at
500 ◦C is 6.81×105 A/cm2 at 2 K, an order of magnitude higher than that of the
as-cast sample. Notably, the Jc of the annealed sample exhibits a broad maximum in
the high-ﬁeld region due to the ﬁshtail eﬀect. Similar behavior is observed in YBCO
