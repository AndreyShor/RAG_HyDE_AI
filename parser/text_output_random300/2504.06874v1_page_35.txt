between the two adjacent polar stackings, as a function of Vg. The extracted optical 
contrast from Vg = 0 V to positive maximum Vg are denoted by red dots and those 
measured from positive maximum Vg to negative maximum Vg are denoted by the blues 
dots. The charge neutrality point roughly lies at Vg = 140 V (indicated by the gray 
dashed lines), which can also be inferred from the vanishing amplitude of the plasmon 
fringes reflected by the domain wall. The yellow shaded area marks the carrier density 
from 0 to hole doping density of 5.46 × 1012𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐−2, where the optical contrast shows 
an increasing trend with increasing hole doping. The white boxes in (b) label the sample 
areas of the two nearby regions in adjacent ABAB and ABCB stackings in which the 
optical contrasts are extracted.

white box marks the scanning area of (b). b, SNOM image of the same tetralayer 
graphene shown in (a), which contains four different optical near-field contrasts at Vg 
= 0 V. The yellow dashed frame labels the scanning area of KPFM mapping shown in 
Fig. S13. c, Raman spectra of the four different stackings. Different symbols in (b) mark 
the positions where the Raman spectra in (c) are taken. Note that the small area of polar 
domains (at the corner of the yellow dashed frame in (b)) makes direct far-field Raman 
measurements challenging. We instead measure the Raman spectra of the nearby polar 
domain that shows identical optical near-field response (red triangles in (b)). The scale 
bar in (b) is 4 µm.
