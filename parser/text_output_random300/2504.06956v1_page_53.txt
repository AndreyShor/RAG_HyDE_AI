6.3
Convergence of the large scales
The main goal of this subsection is to compute the conditional Laplace functionals of the random
measures (µγ,t)t≥0 conditioned on the σ-field Fs defined in (1.5). Heuristically speaking, we want to
get the expectations appearing in the statement of Lemma 6.3 to be of order one, and so we want
to absorb some normalisation factor r(s) into µγ,s,t. Proceeding formally for the moment, given a
function χ : [0, 1]d →R satisfying the conditions in the statement of Lemma 6.3, we consider the
function eχ : [0, 1]d →R such that, for all x ∈[0, 1]d,
e−γχ(x) = e−dsr(s)e−γeχ(x) ,
so that, by Lemma 6.3 with n = 1, W1,· = 0, and θ1 = 1, the following approximate identity holds

for some constant c > 0. Now recalling the definition (6.5), it is easily seen that to get something of
order one on the right-hand side of the above expression, we need to choose r(s) such that

Definition 6.4. We say that a function χ : [0, 1]d →R is admissible if for all ε > 0, there exists
R0 ≥1 such that ρχ,s(BR,s) ≤ε for all s ≥0 sufficiently large and for all R ≥R0 such that
(es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N.
It is immediate to check that Lemma 6.3 for the measure eµγ,s,t can be stated as follows.
Corollary 6.5. Let ε > 0. Then, for s ≥0 sufficiently large, for t > s sufficiently large, and for any
admissible function χ : [0, 1]d →R in the sense of Definition 6.4, such that
