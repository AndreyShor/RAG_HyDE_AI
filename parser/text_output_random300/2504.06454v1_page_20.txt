the lattice strain in NbScTiZr[90]. The interface between the bcc and hcp phases serves
as a barrier to dislocation motion due to the mismatch in structural and mechanical
properties at the interface. The Vickers microhardness, which attains its maximum
value at 400 ◦C, supports the enhancement of interface strengthening[90]. Figures
18(a)-(e) present scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showing the eutectic
microstructures, where the bright and dark phases correspond to the bcc and hcp
phases, respectively. In all samples, the volume fraction of the bcc phase is approx-
imately 50 %. The as-cast sample exhibits a lamellar-like microstructure with an
average thickness of ∼70 nm (Fig. 18(a)), which is retained in the sample annealed
at 400 ◦C. With further increases in annealing temperature, the grain size grows sys-
tematically. Chemical analysis of the as-cast sample reveals that the bcc phase is
Sc-deﬁcient, while the hcp phase is Sc-rich. Signiﬁcant shifts in chemical composition
