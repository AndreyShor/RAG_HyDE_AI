LINEAR TAILS
In this Supplementary Material we oﬀer an alternative derivation for the Price’s tail for the odd modes. The
corresponding metric perturbations for the Schwarzschild BH are the functions h(1)
ℓm(t, r) and h(0)
ℓm(t, r) and they
are determined by the solution Qℓm(t, r) of the RW equation as

where Qℓm(t, r) is the time derivative of qℓm(r, t), such that [10]
qℓm(r, t) =

dt′ Qℓm(r, t′).
(S2)
At large radii, qℓm satisﬁes the equation

qℓm = 0.
(S3)
This diﬀerential equation is invariant under the rescaling (t, r) →(λt, λr) with a constant λ, so that we we may
look for self-similar solutions of the form
qℓm(t, r) = 1

z = t

It then turns out that qℓm(z) satisﬁes

Expressing φℓm as

Eq. (S7) is the associated Legendre diﬀerential equation and it is solved by the associated Legendre functions

fℓm = AℓmP a

As we are interested in the region z > 1, we may use the following expressions of P a

On the other hand, the static problem of Eq. (S3), i.e. qℓm = qℓm(r), is solved by the two independent modes
q(1)
ℓm(r) = r−ℓ,
q(2)
ℓm(r) = rℓ+1.
