Our contributions:
(1) we study, reveal, and describe the interplay between size and
taper angle when grasping objects in VR
(2) we provide visualisations of the multi-dimensional illusion
space, to provide designers with guidelines on VR haptic
perception
(3) we provide mathematical functions that enable designers to
calculate whether a given physical object can represent an
intended virtual object.
(4) We provide an online tool that allows designers to calculate
physical-virtual object pairings within the illusion space.

Related Work
When designing for advanced haptics in VR, researchers have to
consider both co-location – ensuring the haptic feedback is deliv-
ered in the correct location – and object similarity – ensuring the
haptic feedback matches the material and geometric properties of
the virtual object [40]. In this section, we begin by discussing the
different approaches to increasing haptic fidelity, before presenting
the current knowledge in illusory techniques and the associated
perceptual limits.
2.1
Providing Haptics in VR
Research has been exploring two avenues for achieving advanced
haptics: (i) active haptics, and (ii) passive haptics. Some mechani-
cally reflect the exact properties of the virtual objects (active con-
trollers, e.g., Choi et al. [10]) while others use proxy objects and
illusions to render them (passive approaches, e.g., Bergström et al.
[6]).
Much of the recent effort in active haptics has focused on hand-
held and wearable device designs. These can be portable and are
most akin to the controllers we see being adopted commercially.
Prominent examples here include wearable controllers for grasping
rigid objects [10, 11], axisymmetric devices for grasping pseudo-
cylindrical objects [29], and multiple degree-of-freedom controllers
for grasping asymmetric objects [33]. To date, however, these con-
trollers have remained specialist, cumbersome, and heavy.
On the other hand, grounded and encounter-type devices provide
just-in-time feedback, that is only available at the exact moment
the user needs it and can leave them otherwise hands-free. Exam-
ples of such devices include the commercially available Touch1
and Omega2 devices, alongside research prototypes such as in-
FORM Follmer et al. [24], ShapeShift [47], and REACH+ [27]. While
high-resolution, inFORM, for example, features 30×30 individu-
ally controllable haptic pins [24]. This resolution highlights how
these devices are often mechanically complex, bulky, expensive,
and necessitate a step towards infrastructuring that makes them
impractical for everyday use.
As a result of high-resolution active controllers remaining com-
plex, specialist, and bespoke, research has also been exploring op-
portunities for leveraging passive physical objects and haptic illu-
sions, both to enable the use of physical objects in the user’s reach
for feedback and to extend the capacity of haptic controllers. Using
13D Systems, USA - formerly Phantom from Sensable Technologies
2Force Dimension, Switzerland
passive haptic techniques has proven effective across a range of ap-
plications, including for objects in the kitchen [31], for perception
of ledges on the floor [32], to experience spiders [9], and to better
leverage cups in the environment [46]. Furthermore, passive objects
with simply designed geometry features can display various shapes
with edges, curves, and surfaces by altering the visual presentation
and taking advantage of VR visual feedback [3, 4, 53].
By more carefully considering and tailoring the physical props,
however, we might be able to push the ability of the passive hap-
tics further. By designing 3D printed materials and structures, for
example, different textures can be simulated in VR [17, 20]. As for
the geometry properties, a toolkit named Haptwist was developed
to combine passive proxies in a flexible way to represent more
complex virtual objects [57].
Furthermore, there have been new methods developed in attempt
to further push capabilities and to understand better users’ percep-
tion in VR. To figure limits of hand redirection techniques, gaze
detection and electroencephalogram (EEG) have been applied in
some studies [21] instead of merely psychomotor metrics. Research
has also explored the possibility of rendering haptics for complex,
arbitrary shapes with visual feedback [55].
These techniques seek to obscure the visuo-proprioceptive mis-
matches to convince the user they are interacting with the virtual
object when, in fact, they are interacting with something else, poten-
tially somewhere else, creating visuo-haptic illusions. When illusions
are applied within perceptual limits, users are considered unlikely
to notice their occurrence, which results in another type of haptic
techniques using illusions such as retargeting [2] and resizing [6].
These techniques expand the ability of passive objects in VR haptics.
2.2
Illusions in Haptic Feedback
Due to the influence and application potentials of illusions in VR
haptics, numerous studies have concentrated on exploring how
illusions affect users’ perceptions. This illusory work has one of
two focuses: co-location (where the object is), or similarity (what
the object is) [40].
Illusions of co-location have been heavily influenced by redirected
touching [36], haptic retargeting [2] and haptic remapping [38].
These illusions seek to guide the user’s physical hand towards a
proxy object that is spatially decoupled from its virtual counterpart.
Examples have demonstrated redirect controller buttons [28, 54], en-
abled users to grab objects placed around them [13], and attempted
to retarget random, unscripted reaches [12]. From work on these
illusions, we have come to understand the spatial haptic coverage
of a physical object – the area within which it can provide haptic
feedback for virtual objects [14].
Illusions of similarity explore the extent to which one physical
object can feel like another. These illusions aim to convince users
they are interacting with an object with one property (for example,
a heavy hammer), while they in fact interact with an object with
a different property or, at least, with an object with a different
magnitude of that property (e.g., a lightweight bottle). For example,
illusions have been used to simulate factors in interaction such as
geometry [51], force feedback [37], weight [39], stiffness [43] and
texture [7].
