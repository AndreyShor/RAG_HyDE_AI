and the effective number of replicas [257, 258] after reweighting is only moderately reduced,
from the prior Nrep = 100 to Neff = 92 or Neff = 84 in the ρsys = 0 and ρsys = 1 scenarios
respectively. This demonstrates that the inclusion of the LHCb Z+charm measurements affects
the PDFs only weakly.
The charm PDF in the 4FNS before and after inclusion of the LHCb data (with either correlation
model), and the intrinsic charm PDF obtained from it, are displayed in Fig. 3.12 (left and right
respectively). The bands account for both PDF and MHOU. The results show full consistency:
inclusion of the LHCb Rc
j data leaves the intrinsic charm PDF unchanged, while moderately
reducing the uncertainty on it.
We can summarize our results through their so-called local statistical significance, namely, the
size of the intrinsic charm PDF in units of its total uncertainty.
This is displayed in Fig. 3.13 for our default determination of intrinsic charm, as well as after
inclusion of either the LHCb Z+charm or the EMC data, or both. We find a local significance
