Constructing wall turbulence

where the core size decreases with height above the wall and the core variation coefficient
is set to 𝐶𝜎= 0.3, which is found to be largely insensitive (see Appendix A). The average
core size of the vortex tubes is set to 𝜎0 = 0.05ℎ, consistent with the parameters used in the
attached-eddy model described in the literature (Perry & Maruˇsi´c 1995). The geometry of a
single hairpin vortex is depicted by the vortex surface in figure 1(c). Here, vortex surfaces
represent the coaxial envelope of vortex lines. To analyze the complex vortex topology, we
use the normalized vortex surface field (VSF), 𝜙𝑣= 2𝜋𝜎2 𝑓𝑡, as an effective tool (Yang &
Pullin 2010; Yang et al. 2023; Shen et al. 2024).
2.2. Attached-eddy model
Hairpin vortices of various length scales are distributed along the wall surface according
to the attached-eddy hypothesis (Marusic & Monty 2019). In this model, the distance of a
hairpin vortex from the wall is proportional to its characteristic length scale, and vortices
at different scales follow distinct population densities. Attached-eddy models describe how
these vortices are arranged: they can be randomly distributed (Perry & Maruˇsi´c 1995) or form
coherent structures (Marusic 2001). The latter is supported by experimental and numerical
observations (Adrian et al. 2000; Zhou et al. 1999), which reveal that hairpin vortices often
align spatially in wall turbulence, forming coherent vortex packets along the flow direction.
We determine the scale range, hierarchical levels, and number of hairpin vortex packets in
wall turbulence based on the friction Reynolds number, Re𝜏≈0.09Re0.88 (Pope 2000), and
a boundary layer height of 𝛿= 1. The Reynolds number is defined as Re ≡2𝛿¯𝑈/𝜈, where
¯𝑈≡1
𝛿
∫𝛿
0 ⟨𝑈⟩d𝑦= 1 represents the bulk velocity, and 𝜈is the kinematic viscosity. To ensure
consistency with known turbulence structures, these parameters are carefully designed and
calibrated using attached-eddy models that have been extensively studied in the literature. By
systematically incorporating and refining these models, we construct a self-similar hierarchy
of hairpin vortex packets, ensuring that the vortex distribution and scaling behavior align
with established theoretical frameworks.
The number of hierarchical vortex packet levels, 𝑁𝑝, follows a logarithmic-linear relation-

𝜏is the minimum vortex packet height. Subsequent hierarchical levels
display geometric progression in their length scale with the packet scaling factor 𝛼= 2 (Perry
& Chong 1982). At level 𝑖, vortex packets exhibit characteristic heights

The population density of packets of scale 𝑖, defined as the number of packets attached to
the wall per unit area, follows a −2 power law
𝑀𝑖= 𝜅ℎ−2

∝𝛼−2𝑖,
(2.8)
where 𝜅= 0.2 is a constant. These vortex packets are randomly distributed along the wall
while maintaining a minimum spacing of 2ℎ𝑖between any two eddies of the same height to
preserve the sub-Gaussian behavior of the streamwise velocity component (de Silva et al.
2016b).
Each vortex packet consists of 𝑁𝑣= 7 sub-level hairpin vortices arranged along the flow
direction (de Silva et al. 2016a). As illustrated in figure 2(a), these sub-level vortices are
evenly distributed along the streamwise length of the packet, defined as 𝐿𝑖= 3ℎ𝑖. The heights
of individual sub-level vortices within a level-𝑖packet follow
