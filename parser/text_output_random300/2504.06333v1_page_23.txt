Mixed anomaly phases from SymTFT anyons
Let us describe the ‘quantum symmetry’ phases from the 3d TFT perspective.
Instead of the Lagrangian description, from now on, we will use the abstract
language of anyons. Since our overall (enlarged) symmetry is a non-anomalous
Z4, the theory in question will have a Z(VecZ4) SymTFT. There are 16 anyons,
generated by the bosonic lines e4 = m4 = 1. That is, we have both a magnetic and
electric Z4 symmetry, such that Z(VecZ4) ≃Z4⊠ˆZ4. In the Lagrangian description
of the SymTFT (6.8), anyons correspond to
e = eiπ ∮b, e2 = eiπ ∮a, e3 = eiπ ∮a+b,
m = eiπ ∫ˆa, m2 = eiπ ∮ˆb, m3 = eiπ ∮ˆa+ˆb.

The SymTFT has both a physical and symmetry boundary. For the symmetry
boundary we choose a topological boundary condition, which in this case corre-
sponds to a maximal (Lagrangian) algebra. Here we will mimic the selection in [10,
Figure 1], choosing the symmetry boundary’s algebra to be Bsym. = 1 ⊕e ⊕e2 ⊕e3,
corresponding to the boundary condition (6.9). This means that the e lines are
condensed along this boundary, and can end on it. The m lines, on the other hand,
furnish the symmetry boundary with its Z4 symmetry.
Upon interval compactiﬁcation, some or all of this Z4 may be trivially-acting
in the resulting theory. In order for this to be the case, there must be anyons
stretching from the symmetry boundary to the physical boundary which describe
topological point operators (TPOs) living on the symmetry lines, allowing us to
