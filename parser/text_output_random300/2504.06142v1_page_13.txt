The scalar expanded on the generators is:
ϕ = ϕabMab + ˜ϕaPa + ϕaKa + ˜ϕD .
(62)
In accordance with [72], we pick the specific gauge in which ϕ is diagonal of the form
diag(1, 1, −1, −1).
Specifically, we choose ϕ to be only in the direction of the dilatation
generator D:
ϕ = ϕ0 = ˜ϕD
ϕ2=m−214
−−−−−−→ϕ = −2m−1D.
(63)
In this particular gauge, the action reduces to
S = −2aCG
Z
d4x tr ϵµνρσFµνFρσD,
(64)
and the gauge fields e, b and ˜a become scaled as me, mb and m˜a correspondingly. After
straightforward calculations, using the expansion of the field strength tensor as in eq. (56),
and the anticommutation relations of the generators, we obtain:
S = −2aCG

In this point we employ the trace on the several generators and their products. In particular:
tr[KdD] = tr[P dD] = tr[Mab] = tr[D] = 0,
and
tr[MabMcdD] = −1
2ϵabcd.

The resulting broken action is:

while its invariance has obviously been reduced only to Lorentz. Before continuing, we notice
that there is no term containing the field ˜aµ present in the action. Thus, we may set bµ = 0.
This simplifies the form of the two component field strength tensors related to the P and K
generators:
˜Rµν
a = mT (0)a
µν (e) −2m2b[µeν]
a −→mT (0)a
µν (e),
Rµν
a = mT (0)a
µν (f) + 2m2b[µfν]
a −→mT (0)a
µν (f).
(68)
The absence of the above field strength tensors in the action, allows us to also set ˜Rµνa =
Rµνa = 0, and thus to obtain a torsion-free theory.
Since Rµν is also absent from the
expression of the broken action, it may also be set equal to zero. From its definition in eq.
(60), then we obtain the following relation among e and f:
eµ
afνa −eν
afµa = 0.
(69)
The above result reinforces one to consider solutions that relate e and f. We examine two
possible solutions of eq. (69).
