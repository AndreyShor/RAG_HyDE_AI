the Tc of the SC phase.24 These observations highlight the emergence of the hysteresis phase
with a gradual weakening of the SC phase, which is achieved here by increasing the sample
(TBG) temperature around the Tc.
Figure. 3a shows ∆Rxx vs. B|| at (ν, D) = 2.1, 0.00 V/nm for four different ramp-rates of
B||: 100 mT/min, 50 mT/min, 20 mT/min, and 10 mT/min. The |∆Rxx| for ±B|| diminishes
with a slower ramp-rate.31 Still, even for the slowest ramp-rate, we could get a significant
magnitude of ∆Rxx outlining the robustness of the hysteresis observed here. The anomalous
behavior, though, is revealed through the shift in the positions of Bm
|| where we get the
maxima and minima of ∆Rxx at different magnetic field ramp-rates for the magnetic sweep
in the forward and backward direction. We find that the higher the ramp-rate, the higher is
the |Bm
|| | highlighted in the inset of Figure. 3a for B|| < 0.
Another surprising behavior is revealed for the observed hysteresis in Rxx(B||) through
the ‘time-series’ experiment (for detailed measurement protocol, see SI- 5). In brief, for a
given ν with a BMR hysteresis, we start sweeping the applied B|| continuously from +300
mT to a field value of B||stop(∈[−300 mT, 300 mT]), the magnetic field is stopped sweeping
and held at the B||stop for a ‘stop interval’ of 300 seconds and then the in-plane field is again
swept from B||stop either to +300 mT or −300 mT. One such sweep is shown in Figure.
3b for B||stop = −12.5 mT, where Rxx, B|| and temperature of the mixing chamber plate,
TMC (SI-Fig. 27b), is plotted with time, t, in three vertical panels. Let us break down the
behavior of Rxx observed for B||stop = −12.5 mT with t in the top panel of Figure. 3b. With
the continuous sweep of B|| from +300 mT to −12.5 mT, Rxx traces the familiar trace of
RFW

(red curve) as shown Figure. 1d (top panel) but in time, t. We should note here that
the value of B|| where RFW
xx
peaks with magnetic field sweep is ∼−17.5 mT, which signifies
