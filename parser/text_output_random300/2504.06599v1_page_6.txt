parameter a′′ is widely determined compared with other parameters. We have taken positive
values for a, a′, b, c, c′ and d without loss of generality, but we should take both negative
and positive values for a′′ in our numerical calculations. This convention for the parameters
is possible because of the presence of two zeros in the down-type quark mass matrix and the
diagonal up-type quark one.
2.2
The charged lepton mass matrices
Let us discuss the charged lepton mass matrices in this subsection. The matrices are given
by transposed matrices of the down-type quark mass matrices in Eqs. (4), (5) and (6) if the
heavy Higgs bosons HI and HII belong to 5 of the SU(5)GUT. However, those matrices can
not reproduce the observed mass ratios, me/mµ and mµ/mτ. Therefore, we consider the heavy
Higgs bosons are mixtures of 5∗and 45 of the SU(5)GUT. Thus, we have two free parameters
ke and k′
e [3] which represent the two mixing parameters between 5∗and 45.
Now, the textures of the charged lepton mass matrices are given for each type, A1, A2 and
A3 as follows;
M (A1)
e




a′′

We reproduce the observed mass ratios me/mµ and mµ/mτ at the electroweak scale [5] by
taking ke = 3 and k′
e = 1 6. The results on mass ratios me/mµ and mµ/mτ are presented,
respectively in Figs. 1 and 2 7. Notice that the mass eigenvalues are all the same among in
the three cases, A1, A2, A3. Thus, the mass ratios are the same, too. However, the mixing
matrices of the left-handed charged leptons are all different for each others in the three cases
A1, A2, A3. This becomes very important when we consider the neutrino oscillation in the
next section.
6The mass ratios of the charged leptons are almost unchanged by the evolution of the renormalization group
equations.
7Frequency plots in Figs. 1 and 2 are obtained by assuming the normal distribution of parameters in Table
2. The standard deviations are taken to be 2σ for the listed parameter ranges.
