node 𝑖 is expressed in Eq (1), using the degree 𝑘𝑖 of node 𝑖 and the number of actual 
links 𝑒𝑖 of the neighboring nodes. The mean cluster coefficient 𝐶 for the entire graph 
is the mean of the local cluster coefficient 𝐶𝑖 for the number of nodes 𝑛, and is 
expressed as in Eq (2).

Graph density is a feature that indicates the density of the edges connecting 
nodes and is calculated as the ratio of the number of actual edges to the number of 
possible edges. The density 𝐷 of a directed graph is expressed as in Eq (3), using the 
number of nodes 𝑛 and the number of actual edges 𝑚. 
 
𝐷=

Reciprocity is a feature that indicates the mutual relationship between edges 
and is calculated as the ratio of the number of bidirectional edges to the number of edges 
in the graph. The reciprocity 𝑅 is expressed as in Eq (4), using the number of edges 𝑚 
and the number of bidirectional edges 𝑚𝑟. 
 
𝑅= 𝑚𝑟

Assortativity is a feature that indicates the connectivity from one node to 
another similar node and is calculated based on the correlation coefficient of the degrees 
between two nodes. Specifically, the assortativity 𝑆 is expressed as in Eq (5), using the 
element 𝑎𝑖𝑗 of the adjacency matrix 𝑨 for nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗, the out-degree 𝑑𝑖 and 𝑑𝑗, 
the number of edges 𝑚, and the presence/absence 𝛿𝑖𝑗 (0 or 1) of an edge between 𝑖
