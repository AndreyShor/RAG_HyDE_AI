to be underestimated by scale variation, because while it generates the fourth-order leading
pole present in the N4LO (the fifth-order pole vanishes), it fails to generate the sixth-order pole
known to be present in the N5LO splitting function.
We now turn to the IHOU and find again contrasting behavior in the different sectors. In the
quark sector, thanks to the large number of known Mellin moments and the copious information
on the large-x limit, the IHOU are significantly smaller than the MHOU, by about a factor three,
and become negligible for x ≳10−2. In the gluon sector instead the IHOU, while still essentially
negligible for x ≳0.1, is larger than the MHOU except at very small x ≲10−4 where the MHOU
dominates.
Consequently, for all matrix elements at large x ≳0.1 the behavior of the singlet is similar to the
behavior of the non-singlet: IHOU and MHOU are both negligible, meaning that aN3LO results
are essentially exact, and the perturbative expansion has essentially converged, see Fig. 4.5. At
smaller x, while the aN3LO and NNLO results agree within uncertainties, the uncertainties on
the aN3LO are sizable, dominated by MHOUs in the quark channel and by IHOUs in the gluon
channel.
