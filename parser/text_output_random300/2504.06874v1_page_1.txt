Abstract  
The recent discovery of sliding ferroelectricity has sparked intense interests in studying 
interfacial polarizations in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials. However, 
akin to the conventional ferroelectrics, the studies have predominantly reported 
semiconducting and/or insulating moiré systems and binary compounds. Spontaneous 
electric polarizations in elemental metallic phases remain scarcity. Here, we report the
