Our physically-based indirect illumination modeling helps us
achieve natural relighting results. More results are in the supple-

We evalu-
ate the impact of our Spatially-varying Gaussian representa-
tion in Tab. 3 and Fig. 10. As shown in Fig 10, our Spatially-
varying Gaussian shows a smoother surface, and fewer arti-
facts compared to the Constant Gaussian.

in-depth ablation study on components (visibility, indirect
illumination) of our physically-based indirect illumination,
as shown in Tab. 4.

6.4. Discussion and limitations
We have identified several limitations of our method. We
do not introduce geometric prior, leading to unsatisfied re-
covery for highly specular objects. This issue can be al-
leviated by introducing SDF like GS-ROR [38], which we
leave for future work. Additionally, our model brings 50%
∼80% more GPU memory cost compared to 3DGS/2DGS
and 10% ∼20% more compared to Relightable 3DGS [6],
due to the Gaussian vertices.
7. Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented a novel framework for in-
verse rendering. At the core of our framework is a spatially-
varying Gaussian representation and a curve Gaussian ren-
dering scheme, which allows spatially-varying material and
normal parameters, showing more powerful representa-
tion capability than typical Gaussian primitives. Besides,
we present a physically-based indirect illumination mod-
eling method, which brings physical constraints for train-
ing and enables natural indirect light for relighting. Conse-
quently, our method outperforms existing NeRF-based and
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods without losing
efficiency. In future work, improving the geometric accu-
racy is a potential direction.
