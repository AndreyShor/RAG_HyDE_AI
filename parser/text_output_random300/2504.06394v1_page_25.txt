this finding suggests that under certain conditions, such as during rapid head movements, the
vestibular system may exhibit enhanced sensitivity to acceleration due to inertial effects.
The assumption of an idealized toroidal geometry allowed for significant analytical
simplifications but is also a significant simplification of the true anatomy of the semicircular
canals, which exhibit variations in cross-sectional shape. To address this, we extended our
analysis to more realistic geometries, focusing on domains with a single enlarged region that
deviates from the perfect torus. In these regions, we found thatsignificant deviation in radius
gives another mechanism for the breaking of flow symmetry (in addition to the rigidity–
induced effect already discussed). These results provide new insights into the functional
implications of anatomical variability in the semicircular canals. For example, variations
in canal geometry across species or due to developmental differences may influence the
sensitivity and response characteristics of the vestibular system.
In each of the scenarios considered, our analytical approach enabled us to derive explicit
expressions for the transition point between physical regimes, that is we obtained formulas
for the critical values of the relevant system parameters at which the transition between
different regimes occurs. These formulas lend insight into the fine balance between different
components of the system, and enable to speculate on how the vestibular system may have
been fine tuned by evolution in different organisms, and/or key considerations in engineering
an artificial vestibular system. We turn to such considerations next.
7.1. Implications and applications
The findings of this study have several implications for both biology and engineering. In
the context of vestibular physiology, our results contribute to a deeper understanding of how
the semicircular canals transduce head motion into neural signals. The distinction between
velocity-sensitive and acceleration-sensitive regimes suggests that while the mechanical
properties of the cupula, combined with canal geometry, enable the system to function under
a wide range of motion frequencies (Bronstein et al. 2013) it emphasizes that what is sensed
differs markedly across this parameter space. This flexibility of sensing may be useful for
maintaining balance and spatial orientation across diverse locomotor activities (Golding &
Gresty 2005, 2015).
Here, it is worth considering the distinction between the soft cupula (𝜅≪1) and stiff
cupula (𝜅≫1) regimes in terms of dimensional quantities. Recall that 𝜅is defined as
𝜅= 𝐵T/(𝑎2𝑅𝜇), where T is the timescale for the head motion, 𝑎and 𝑅are respectively
the small and large radii defining the canals, and 𝐵is the cupula’s bending stiffness. We see
that the soft cupula regime may be attained for fast movements (small T), large canals (𝑎, 𝑅
large) and of course soft cupulas in absolute terms (small 𝐵). The converse holds for the
stiff cupula regime. Inserting parameter values for 𝑎, 𝑅, 𝐵and 𝜇into the transition value
predicted by our model, 𝜅𝑐= 16𝐼4𝛼(𝑏), we obtain a critical value

which may be interpreted as a critical frequency of rotation below which the system responds
to angular velocity, and above which the system responds to angular acceleration. Inserting
typical values for a human adult, we compute a transition frequency of 0.27 Hz. Interestingly,
human experiments with controlled oscillation frequencies have reported a maximum motion
sickness when the frequency is around 0.2 Hz (Golding et al. 2001). Our analysis suggests
an intriguing possible explanation for this maximal sickness at intermediate frequencies:
intermediate frequencies correspond to motion for which the response of the cupular system
follows neither the angular acceleration nor velocity. The “neural mismatch” hypothesis
