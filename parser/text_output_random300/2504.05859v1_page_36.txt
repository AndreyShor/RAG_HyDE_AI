termed as the two-profile analysis. For each fitting, the two TR profiles are rescaled 
and spectrally shifted within a narrow range about 1 nm, which are optimized based on 
the principle of least squares; the maximums of the rescaled TR profiles are used to 
extract 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 and ∆𝑇𝑇∗, according to the relations obtained in Figure S4d and Figure S5c, 
respectively. Noteworthy, choosing another set of the TR profiles with different 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 or 
∆𝑇𝑇 will not alter the results, as the normalized TR profiles with varying either 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 or 
∆𝑇𝑇 have similar shapes (Figure S4c and Figure S5b).

Figure S8. The two-profile analysis of the TR spectrum. (a) and (b) are respectively 
the contour plots of the temperature-increase and electron-transfer TR profiles as a 
function of 𝜏𝜏, obtained by fitting the TR spectra in Figure 2 with the two-profile 
analysis. (c) The TR spectra (solid) and fitting results (dashed) at varying 𝜏𝜏. The curves 
are displaced vertically for clarity.
