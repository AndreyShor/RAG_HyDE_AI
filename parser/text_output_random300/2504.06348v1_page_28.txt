A generic state preparation algorithm can achieve this unitary with a number of gates scaling linearly with
the Hilbert space dimension in the worst case, hence as O(log(1/ϵ)) due to Eq. (72) [76, 77]. We apply the
following protocol to each of the k = 1, ..., 3ηs
ion −6 modes, to obtain the state in Eq. (71):
• Initialize all qubits in zero: |0⌈log2 lmax
s,k ⌉⟩⊗|0nvib⟩.
• Perform the unitary V s,k on the |0⌈log2 lmax
s,k ⌉⟩qubits.
• Perform the controlled unitary U s,k
C
= Plmax
s,k
l=0 |l⟩⟨l| ⊗U s,k

.
The total cost of this procedure across all ions scales as O(ηionnvib log(1/ϵ))) in the worst case, and in practice
it can be neglected compared to the rest of the algorithm.
Note that the protocol we have described can be generalized to other non-thermal mixtures as desired.
For example, we might create a mixture of modes in an specific energy band that is relevant to a reaction
mechanism of interest, or rather understand a reaction mechanism itself by creating an energy band of
vibrational excitations and moving the energy band higher/lower while observing the resulting products.
Electrons.
We prepare the electrons in an approximate ground state of the BO Hamiltonian (Eq. (50)) as
computed by classical computational methods such as DFT. Explicitly, for each particle on a grid r that is
the inverse Fourier transform of the plane wave basis, we wish to create,
|gel
s (Rs,0)⟩= A

i1,...,iηs

r1,...,rηs
val
ci1,...iηs
val(Rs,0)ϕi1(r1; Rs,0)...ϕiηs
val(rηs
val; Rs,0)|r1, ..., rηs
val⟩
where {ϕi(r; Rs,0)} are a suitably chosen set of normalized spin orbitals in which the classical calcula-
tion is performed, and A denotes the anti-symmetrization operator. Since classical methods often give a
single (single-reference/single-determinant, e.g. the Hartree-Fock state) or at most a superposition (multi-
reference/multi-determinant) of a few product states,20 most of the coefficients ci1,...iηs
val (Rs,0) vanish.
For the typical case of a single product state given by single set α = {i1, ..., iηs
val}, we load the ηs
val single-
particle states in parallel and use the efficient anti-symmetrization circuit of Ref. [78] for A, to prepare a
single-reference state,
|ϕs
α⟩= A
ηs
val
O
j=1
X
rj
ϕij(rj; Rs,0)|rj⟩
Recalling that |G| is the size of the basis, the loading procedure has a worst case cost O(ηs
val|G|), and the
anti-symmetrization circuit costs O(ηs
val logc ηs
val log |G|) (with c ≥1). More refined techniques than simple
loading could be used to lower the cost to logarithmic in the number of plane waves and polynomial in the
number of primitive Gaussian functions approximating the Slater determinant [79], but in practice including
these is not currently a priority in our setting. For example, with |G| ∼106, ηval ∼100, S ∼10 one can
expect an overall gate cost ∼109, which as we shall see is a sub-leading contribution to the overall cost of
the algorithm.
Multi-reference states of ndet products can be prepared using an additional LCU procedure. Defining
U s
α|0⟩= |ϕs
α⟩for the sets of determinants α1, ..., αndet, V s|0⟩= Pndet
α=1
p
csα(Rs,0)|α⟩for their associated
coefficients, and the select operator S = P
α |α⟩⟨α| ⊗U s
α, we obtain,
(V s)†SV s|0⟩|0⟩=
1
λs
det
|0⟩|gel
s (Rs,0)⟩+ |0⊥⟩
20Increasing the amount of determinants in the state comes with significant classical computational overhead. Often a single
determinant is sufficient for practical situations but, on occasion, one might want to refine this approximation with additional
terms.
Note again that very high accuracy in the initial state should not be needed for our purposes, since it is only an
approximate initial state from which significant entanglement can arise through full Hamiltonian dynamics.
