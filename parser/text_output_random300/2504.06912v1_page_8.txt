FIG. 6. Error analysis. Normalized root mean square error (RMSE) for all the comparisons between the RSum and mRes
methods presented before. The cuts a, b and c are at the same value of N’s in all the plots, namely 64, 128 and 512. The
corresponding responses are shown as insets for reference. We see that in every case the mRes approach yields a smaller RMSE
for lower N. The non-universal critical N beyond which the RSum performs better is found only for a relatively large N.

FIG. 7. A lower bound on the sub-interval size. The coloured region represents the natural spread δ0 of a singularity at
x = x∗. This scale is non-universal and depends on the nature of the singularity. The blue region represents the spread of the
singular sub-interval which depends on the choice of δ, which is reduced across panels. When δ ≳δ0, mRes correctly integrates
the singularity. For δ < δ0, we introduce the grey regions that we wish to avoid. In this region the singularity is medium-varying
and is not accounted for in the mRes prescription. At the same time, the narrowing of the singular sub-interval (blue) also
indicates that we do not adequately pick up the correct contribution from the singularity, leading to an underperformance of
the mRes prescription. The avoidance of the gray regions and the narrowing of blue regions set a lower limit to the interval
size δ which are delimited here by the dashed vertical lines.
idea is illustrated. In these sub-intervals (shown in gray),
our approximation of slow-varying I(ω, x) breaks down
leading to incorrect weights for the intervals.
This is
the source of the prescription eventually underperform-
ing compared to the Riemann sum for larger N – that is,
as δ →0.
Unfortunately, there is not a universal scheme to iden-
tify a ‘critical’ length of the sub-interval δ0 as different
singularities have different ranges over which they need
to be integrated over. Fortunately, however, this is not
usually a concern as it is encountered only at large N’s,
where the use of conventional integration routines would
be sufficient to obtain good results. We remind the reader
that this is a prescription designed to help improve the
results when the mesh is coarse.
