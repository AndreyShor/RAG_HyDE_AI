Furthermore, for 0 ≤s < t, we let Zs,t be the field on Rd given by
Zs,t(·)
def=
Z t
s
Z
Rd(K(e−r(· −y)) −K(e−r·)K(e−ry))e−dr
2 ξ′(dy, dr) ,
(3.11)
with the notational convention that Z0,t = Zt.
We observe that, for any x, y ∈Rd and s, t ≥0, it holds that
E[Z∞(x)Z∞(y)] =
Z ∞
0
(K(e−r(x −y)) −K(e−rx)K(e−ry))dr ,
(3.12)
E[Zs(x)Zt(y)] =
Z s∧t
0
(K(e−r(x −y)) −K(e−rx)K(e−ry))dr .
(3.13)
It is straightforward to check that the field Zt(·) converges weakly in law with respect to the local
uniform topology in C(Rd) to Z∞(·) as t →∞(see e.g. [Mad15, Proposition 2.4]).
We also record here a decomposition result for ⋆-scale invariant fields originally stated in [DRSV14a]
and which can be proved by standard computation of covariances.
Lemma 3.10 ([DRSV14a, Lemma 16]). For z ∈Rd, the field (Xt(x))t≥0,x∈Rd admits the following
decomposition
Xt(x) =
Z t
0
K(er(x −z))dXr(z) + Zz
t (x) ,
∀t ≥0 , ∀x ∈Rd ,
where (Zz
t (x))t≥0,x∈Rd is a centred Gaussian field independent of (Xt(z))t≥0 and with the following
covariance structure,
E[Zz
s(x)Zz
t (y)] =
Z s∧t
0
(K(er(x −y)) −K(er(x −z))K(er(y −z)))dr ,
∀s, t ≥0, ∀x, y ∈Rd .
We emphasise that for all t ≥0, it holds that Z0
t(e−t·)
law= Zt(·), where Zt is the field introduced in
Definition 3.9.

Local structure of extremal points
The main goal of this section is to prove Theorems A and B. We emphasise that the arguments
for the proofs of these two theorems are inspired by and follow similar lines to the proofs of
[BL18, Theorems 2.3 and 2.4].
This section is structured as follows. In Section 4.1, we introduce the precise setup and state a slightly
stronger version of Theorems A and B. In Section 4.2, we explain how to convert the statement about
the supremum of the field being less than λ into a condition on the driving process to stay above a
polylogarithmic curve. In Section 4.3, we collect some technical lemmas that are needed for the proof
of the main theorems, while their proofs are contained in Section 4.4.

Setup and statement of results
Recalling Definition 3.9, for b ∈N ∪{∞}, we introduce the field Φb on Rd given by
Φb(·)
def= −
Z b
0
(1 −K(e−s·))dBs + Zb(·) ,
(4.1)
where (Bs)s≥0 is a standard Brownian motion independent of the space-time white noise ξ′ used in
the definition of the field Zb introduced in Definition 3.9. We observe that the field Φb defined in (4.1)
