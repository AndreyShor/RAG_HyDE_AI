neglecting non-factorizable electro-weak corrections, the
hadronic and leptonic parts do not interfere with each
other, the contribution to the differential rate (for each
combination of flavors) can be written in terms of the
contraction between the leptonic tensor Lαβ(pℓ, pν) =

Using
special relativity, H can be decomposed in terms of five
independent spectral-densities form-factors which, in the
reference-frame of the Ds meson, are functions of ω0 and
of ω2. From these, one can construct three linear com-
binations, Z(0), Z(1), and Z(2), that enter the expression
of the differential decay rate integrated over the lepton
energy. Denoting the upper integration-limit for ω0 as
ωmax, one has

Indeed, the hadronic
tensor of Eq. (1), and therefore its linear combinations
Z(p)(ω0, ω2), cannot be directly computed on the lattice.
It is possible, instead, to compute the (amputated) corre-
lator ⟨Ds(p)|T{J†

clusive decay rate Γ is then reduced to the problem of
establishing a connection between Eq. (3) and Eq. (4).
The problem can be addressed in a mathematically well-
defined, systematically improvable way through the HLT
method of Ref. [18]. The basic idea consists in relying on
the Stone-Weierstrass theorem to represent the smooth
kernels of Eq. (3) according to

i.e. on the basis-functions given by the exponentials ap-
pearing in Eq. (4) with coordinates given by the vector
of the coefficients g(p).
These coefficients are fixed by
minimizing a linear combination of the so-called “norm”
and “error” functionals. The norm functional measures
the distance between the exact kernel Θ(p)
σ (ωmax −ω0)
and its approximation according to the r.h.s. of Eq. (5)
at finite N. The error functional, originally introduced
by Backus and Gilbert [31], is defined in terms of the
covariance matrix of the correlators ˆZ(p) evaluated at fi-
nite lattice spacing. Thus, the HLT algorithm improves
on the classical Backus-Gilbert method by using a desired
smearing kernel as input, and is designed to provide an
optimal trade-off between the “accuracy” and the “pre-
cision” of the numerical solution to the problem.
By using the coefficients g(p) obtained through the HLT
algorithm, the differential decay rate can be obtained ac-

Similar formulae can be introduced for the leptonic mo-
ments Mn (defined by weighting the differential decay
rate with the n−th power of the lepton energy and nor-
malizing by the total rate) and the associated differential
quantities dMn/dω2 (see Sec. IV of Ref. [1]).
