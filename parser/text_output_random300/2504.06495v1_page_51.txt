diﬀerential equation
Lϕ0 = −λ0ϕ0,
together with the boundary condition ϕ0(log(ǫ)) = 0.
Solving this ODE explicitly, one
obtains a general solution of the form:
ϕ0(x) = Aeµx/σ2 + Ber−x,
with r−< µ/σ2,
and the boundary condition determines the constants A and B. For all x > log(ǫ), the
dominant term is the exponential eµx/σ2, and the eigenfunction satisﬁes
ϕ0(x) ∝eµx/σ2.

This establishes equations (30) and (31), which form the basis for our proof of Theorem 3.

Proof of the main text theorems
The above results from Karlin and Taylor (1981) provide the foundation needed for proving
Theorem 3. We will prove Theorem 3 ﬁrst, then us it to prove Theorem 2, and then ﬁnally
use that to prove Theorem 1.
Proof of Theorem 3.
We consider the continuous-time process {Xτ : τ ≥0} deﬁned
in (18). Let P(τ, x) := P(Xτ ̸= −∞| X0 = x) denote the survival probability. From the
spectral representation results summarized in Equations (30) and (31), we know that for
large τ, the survival probability admits the asymptotic form
P(τ, x) ∼ϕ0(x)e−λ0τ,
where λ0 is the smallest eigenvalue of the generator, and ϕ0(x) is the corresponding eigen-
function. Therefore, for any two initial conditions xa, xb > log(ǫ), we have:
lim
τ→∞
P(τ, xa)
P(τ, xb) = ϕ0(xa)
ϕ0(xb).
