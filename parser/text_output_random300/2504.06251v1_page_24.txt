where ω = ei2π/3. g1,g2 and g3 denote the three moir´e reciprocal lattice vectors. We take the
zeroth and first-harmonics of the moir´e potential V0 = 20 meV and V1 = 30 meV in the calculation
of Extended Data Fig. 9b,d. However, neither the moir´e bands nor the enhancement of the flat
band is captured in the calculations, indicating that the moir´e potential is still underestimated.
The NanoARPES intensity is simulated based on the Fermi golden rule, taking into account

where UG,l,α;n(k) and Ek,n are the wavefunction and energy of the initial Bloch state, p|| and
pz denote the in-plane and out-of-plane photoelectron momentum, and c0 denotes the inter-layer
spacing of RG which is typically 0.33 nm. An imaginary part of pz is also introduced to model
the signal decay beneath the surface. A is the polarization vector of the incident light, and v =
∇kH(k) denotes the velocity operator.
