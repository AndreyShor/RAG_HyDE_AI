almost unchanged even when an edge is deleted. 
Fig 5A1 shows the calculation results of the mean 𝑐𝜇 and deviation 𝑐𝜎 of 
centrality for (a) market economy. The horizontal axis is the number of steps 𝑡, and the 
vertical axis is the mean 𝑐𝜇 and deviation 𝑐𝜎. The results of the three calculations are 
shown by the three blue and three green lines, respectively. Similarly, 5B1 shows (b) 
the power economy, 5C1 shows (c) the gift economy, and 5D1 shows (d) the concession 
economy. Fig 5A2 shows the calculation results of the Gini coefficient 𝐺 for (a) market 
economy. The horizontal axis represents the number of steps 𝑡, and the vertical axis 
represents the Gini coefficient 𝐺. The results of the three calculations are represented 
by three blue lines. Similarly, 5B2 shows (b) the power economy, 5C2 shows (c) the 
gift economy, and 5D2 shows (d) the concession economy.
