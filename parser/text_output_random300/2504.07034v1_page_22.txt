Condition (a) is satisfied since Λ1 is the region of state (1) as shown in Figs. 4.3–4.4 above,
and Γshock = ∂Λ1 ∩∂Ωin both the supersonic and subsonic cases.
We now check condition (b) of Lemma 4.1. Assume that Γshock is a straight segment. Recall
that S1 = Γ1
shock is the straight shock between states (1) and (2), i.e., the line passing through
points P0 and P2 for the supersonic reflection, and through P0 for the subsonic reflection. Using
Definition 4.7(iv), we obtain that (ρ, v)(P2) = (ρ2, v2)(P2) for the non-symmetric supersonic
reflection, and (ρ, v)(P0) = (ρ2, v2)(P0) for the non-symmetric subsonic reflection, where (ρ, v)
in both cases is computed from the Ω–side. Thus, the tangent line to Γint
1
= Γshock at the upper
endpoint, i.e., at P2 for the non-symmetric supersonic reflection and at P0 for the non-symmetric
subsonic reflection, is line S1. Similarly, we have the tangent line to Γint
1
= Γshock at the lower
endpoint, i.e., at P3 for the non-symmetric supersonic reflection and at P1 for the non-symmetric
subsonic reflection, is line S2 = Γ2
shock. Hence, if Γshock is a straight segment, then Γshock lies
on both lines S1 and S2; in particular, these lines coincide. It follows that S1 = S2 is the line
passing through P0 and P1, and Γshock lies within interval P0P1. However, the wedge is convex
since θi
w ∈(0, π
2 ) for i = 1, 2, so P0P1 lies within the wedge, thus outside Λ. It follows that
Γshock ⊂P0P1 lies outside Λ, which contradicts the structure of regular reflection-diffraction
configuration. That is, the assumption that Γshock is a straight segment leads to a contradiction,
which verifies (b) of Lemma 4.1.
Next, we show condition (c) of Lemma 4.1 is satisfied.
Consider first the case of reflections that are supersonic at P0, i.e., |v2(P0)| > c2; see Fig. 4.3.
Then we need to show that (v·τ shock)(P2) ̸= 0. Assume this is not true, then (v·τ shock)(P2) = 0.
Note that τ shock(P2) = τ S1 and v|Ω(P2) = v2(P2) by Definition 4.7(ii, iv) so that v2(P2)·τ S1 = 0
and
|v(P2) · νshock| = |v2(P2) · νS1| = |v2(P2)| = c2,
which contradicts the last inequality in (2.12). Thus condition (c) of Lemma 4.1 is proved in
the case when |v2(P0)| > c2.
In the case of reflections that are sonic at P0, i.e., |v2(P0)| = c2 (see Fig. 4.4), the argument
is the same as above with only notational change: we use point P0 here instead of point P2.
It remains to consider the case of reflections that are subsonic at P0, i.e., |v2(P0)| < c2;
see Fig. 4.4. Assume that (v · τ shock)(P0) = 0. Recall that (ρ, v)(P0) = (ρ2, v2)(P0) for the
subsonic reflection and S1 is tangent to Γshock at P0, as we have shown above. Thus, from
(v · τ shock)(P0) = 0, we obtain that (v2 · τ S1)(P0) = 0. Since S1 is the line shock between states
(1) and (2), the last equality implies by (2.10) that (v1 · τ S1)(P0) = 0, so that line L through
centers O1 = (u(1)
1 , 0) and O2 = (u(2)
1 , u(2)
2 ) of states (1) and (2) (which is orthogonal to S1)
intersects S1 at P0. Since P0 ∈Γwedge, O2 ∈L∩Γwedge (where O2 ∈Γwedge because v2 ·ν = 0 on
Γwedge), and L ∩Γwedge = {P0}, it follows that O2 = P0 so that v2(P0) = 0. Since v2(P0) = 0,
it follows from the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions (2.9)–(2.10) on S1 between states (1) and (2)
that v1(P0) = 0, that is, O1 = P0. However, this is not true since O1 = (u(1)
1 , 0) for u(1)
1
> 0,
while P0 = (l cos θ1
w, l sin θ1
w) for some l > 0. This contradiction shows that (v · τ shock)(P0) ̸= 0,
i.e., condition (c) of Lemma 4.1 holds for the subsonic reflection at P0.
Now all the conditions of Lemma 4.1 are verified for the regular reflection solutions. Applying
Lemma 4.1, we obtain that Definition 3.1(viii) holds.
4. Now, all the conditions of Theorem 3.2 are verified for the regular reflection solutions.
Then the conclusion of Theorem 4.10 follows from Theorem 3.2.

past a Solid Ramp. The second example is the Prandtl reflection problem for the isentropic
Euler system (2.1). This is of a self-similar structure that occurs when a 2-D supersonic flow
with density ρ∞> 0 and velocity v∞= (u∞, 0), u∞> 0, along the wedge-axis hits the wedge in
the direction at t = 0. See Figs. 4.5–4.6; also see Bae-Chen-Feldman [2,3] and Elling-Liu [26].
