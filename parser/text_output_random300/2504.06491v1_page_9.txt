METHODS
A.
Crystal Grown and Sample Preparation
In the first step of crystal growth, hydrothermal reac-
tions were performed in 45 ml PTFE-lined stainless steel
autoclaves. Zn-substituted barlowite powder was synthe-
sized in this reaction using CuO (Aldrich), NH4F (Alfa,
96%), ZnBr2 (BTC, 99.999%), and 20 ml D2O (Aldrich,
99.9%). These contents are heated over 2.5 hrs from 35
◦C to 185◦C, held for 48 hrs, then cooled back to 30◦C
over 30h. The complete products of this pre-reaction (in-
cluding both the Zn-barlowite powder and ion-rich D2O)
were placed into a 11.8mm OD thin-walled PFA Teflon
liner and frozen.
The end of the liner was then vac-
uum sealed (∼10−2 Torr) and the liner and the contents
were placed into a quartz tube with an inner diameter
of 12.7mm and outer diameter of 18.7mm.
With the
contents frozen, vacuum was pulled in the quartz tube
(∼10−3 Torr) and it was sealed. The PFA Teflon liner is
necessary for this growth to ensure the present fluorine
ions do not react with the quartz tube; this removes them
from the reaction and weakens the quartz tube, leading
to an explosion hazard.
Note that the pre-reaction to
form Zn-barlowite powder can also be performed directly
in the Teflon-lined test tube; both methods are effective,
but the separate pre-reaction in the autoclave seemed to
work more consistently for us.
Two separate quartz tube assemblies were made with
this above process. Each was placed inside a three zone
furnace for continued hydrothermal synthesis. The zones
formed a temperature gradient with a ∼180◦C hot end
and a ∼170◦C at the cold. The pre-reacted powder is
manipulated to start at the hot end. In these furnace
conditions, Zn-substituted barlowite powder will dissolve
in the D2O fluid at the hot end and will nucleate at the
cold end as it is slowly thermally transported there. The
growths were monitored regularly and ran for approx-
imately one year. Each growth yielded several clumps
of large crystals that were strongly attached to each
other at domain walls. Manually separating these clumps
yielded single-domain crystals up to ∼5×5×0.1mm in
size. ICP-AES measurements on the resulting groups of
crystals revealed Zn concentrations of x=0.78 for batch
one and x=0.85 for batch 2. Electron microprobe analy-
sis was also performed and corroborated the above mea-
surements, revealing Zn-concentrations x=0.75 for batch
one and x=0.85 for batch 2. 0.57 g of crystals from the
first batch and 0.19 g from the second were coaligned
on two mounting plates using CYTOP adhesive. This
yielded a total sample mass of 0.76 g. Figure 6 in the
Extended Data shows the final sample assembly.
