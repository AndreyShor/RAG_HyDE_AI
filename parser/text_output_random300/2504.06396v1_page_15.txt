Verification
The outcomes for each test case across the three different topologies are detailed in Table 4. The
average path length, denoted as 𝐿𝑎𝑣𝑒, exhibits minimal variation between the star and radial
topologies, typically ranging from four to six hops between routers, indicative of more direct
paths. In contrast, the statistics-based topology demonstrates a considerably greater path length,
averaging about 13 hops for the 500-bus case, 18 hops for the 2,000-bus case, and 6 hops for the
