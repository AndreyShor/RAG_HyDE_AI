of π, a tensor subcategory of C. In particular, this subsumes the notions of exact
sequences of groups and Hopf algebras [31,32]. Here, by a tensor functor we mean
a linear functor equipped with a strong monoidal structure (without braiding) [30].
We unpack this deﬁnition. A dominant tensor functor F ∶C →D is a tensor
functor such that every object d ∈ob(D) is the subobject of an object F(c) in the
image of F. That is to say, every object d admits a monomorphism i ∶d →F(c)
to some F(c).
On the other hand, a tensor functor F ∶C →D is normal if for every object
c ∈ob(C) there is an object c0 ∈ob(C) such that F(c0) is the largest trivial
subobject of F(c). An object d is called trivial if it is isomorphic to a sum of n
copies of the monoidal unit
1D for some n ∈Z≥0.
Now, given a dominant normal tensor functor π ∶C →D, one can consider the
full subcategory Kerπ ⊂C spanned by objects c ∈ob(C) whose image is trivial in D.
This subcategory is a tensor subcategory C and is referred to as the kernel of π.
In an exact sequence of tensor categories (C.1), the image ı(K) of the embedding
category ı ∶K →C is tensor equivalent ı(K) ≅Kerπ to the kernel of π.
