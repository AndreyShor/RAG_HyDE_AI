model naturally gives rise to a centrality measure on influence networks, with PageRank emerging as a special case [1,
49]. A corresponding centrality measure can be defined for the FJ-MM model, naturally prompting the question of
how memory and higher-order neighbors influence a node’s centrality. Even for classical FJ models, the relationship
between the convergence rate (i.e., the spectral radius) and the properties of influence networks has not been fully
explored (some relevant results can be found, e.g., in [15,43]) – a challenge that becomes even more pronounced for
the FJ-MM model. While the limitation L = 2 (capturing only the influence of neighbors-of-neighbors, or one-step
memory) can be easily relaxed by considering longer walks, it is plausible that the effective depth of memory is both
time-varying and potentially random. For example, social media platforms like Facebook can randomly retrieve
events or posts from several months or years ago. This type of randomness in social interactions is notably distinct
from that observed in randomized gossip-based models [48] and appears to be underexplored.
