FIG. 4. Experiment results for the ground state energy of the 2-spin (a), 3-spin (b), and 4-spin (c) circular Ising model with varying transverse
field intensities J. Noise-free simulation results are indicated by the yellow triangles, while the exact ground state energy is shown by the black
dashed line. Error-mitigated results obtained through first-order Richardson extrapolation are shown in blue, along with data for noise scaling
factors c = 1 in red and c = 2.2 in green. The short transverse lines represent numerical simulations incorporating measured decoherence rates,
where each data point corresponds to 20 different random initial parameter sets for direct comparison with experimental results.
To optimize the circuit parameters, we employ the simul-
taneous perturbation stochastic approximation algorithm [11,
39], which is particularly effective in quantum optimization
tasks due to its ability to estimate the gradient with only two
measurements per iteration, regardless of the number of pa-
rameters involved. The red dots in Fig. 3 illustrate the learning
process of the 4-spin model, where each iteration of the opti-
mization algorithm includes two measurements correspond-
ing to perturbations in opposite directions in the parameter
space, represented by the lighter and darker data points, re-
spectively. Throughout the optimization process, each data
point represents the average of more than 20,000 measure-
ment samples. Given the long lifetime of the photonic qubit
in the storage cavity, the standard initialization method, which
relies on waiting for spontaneous relaxation of the population
in the cavity, would introduce significant delays and poten-
tial system drift before convergence. To address this, we im-
plement an active population purge by applying measurement
and feedback control to the cavity, allowing for faster initial-
ization [34, 40].
To improve the precision of the VQE, we implement the
analog error mitigation that involves measuring the energy of
the system under different noise levels and using Richardson
extrapolation to estimate the zero-noise energy. Specifically,
as previously mentioned, in each iteration, the energy of the
quantum state is first obtained under normal noise conditions
with a noise coefficient c = 1, as shown by red dots in Fig. 3.
Then, the transmon qubit noise is amplified by a factor of
c = 2.2 through the noise injection, and the energy is recalcu-
lated. Using Richardson extrapolation, we estimate the zero-
noise energy by combining these two measurements, mitigat-
ing the impact of transmon qubit noise to the first order. The
mitigated energies are then iteratively incorporated into the
optimization process to refine the circuit parameters, leading
to improved accuracy of the results. Despite these efforts, a
discrepancy remains compared to the exact energy, primarily
due to the extended gate duration, which increases the impact
of decoherence. While error mitigation reduces noise effects,
first-order mitigation alone is insufficient for achieving the de-
sired precision, underscoring the need for higher-order tech-
niques to close the gap.
We further validate the qubit-efficient VQE algorithm and
explore the effect of analog error mitigation by solving the
ground state energy of systems with varying spin numbers
(N = 1,2,3) and different transverse field intensities J. Fig-
ure 4 summarizes the experimental results, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach across a range of system sizes
and parameters. For each system configuration, we perform
numerical simulations incorporating the measured system de-
coherence rates, using 20 random initial parameter sets. The
corresponding simulation data (horizontal bars) are plotted to
the right of the experimental data points for direct comparison.
As evident from Fig. 4, the experimental data exhibit a con-
sistent trend with the exact ground state energy as the trans-
verse field intensity J varies. However, a systematic deviation
from the ideal eigenvalues is observed, which can be attributed
to the presence of unmitigated noise in the quantum system.
Remarkably, our numerical simulations, which take into ac-
count the systemâ€™s decoherence rates, show excellent agree-
ment with the experimental data. This consistency highlights
