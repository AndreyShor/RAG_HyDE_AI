Polarised predictions with higher-order corrections have been of particular interest for di-
boson production in the last few years. In particular, NLOQCD corrections have been obtained
for WZ production in final states with two charged leptons and jets [358]. Furthermore, NLOEW
corrections have also been computed for WW [361,362] and WZ [363] production (in the latter
case, first results were already provided in Ref. [360]). In addition to strictly fixed order pre-
dictions, a first step toward matching higher orders with parton shower has been achieved. In
particular, in Ref. [367], NLOQCD corrections were matched to parton shower for all production
mechanisms. In addition, results on how to enhance doubly-longitudinal polarised states and
study the radiation amplitude zero effect in WZ production have been made public [820]. In
Ref. [821], a study of the bottom-quark contribution at NLO QCD+EW accuracy has been
presented. In Ref. [822], polarised predictions for ZZ pairs in gluon fusion and in vector-boson
fusion have been presented.
In Ref. [823], two-loop planar master integrals for the massive NNLOQCD corrections for
WW production have been obtained. In addition, in Ref. [824], analytical results for three-loop
ladder diagrams with two off-shell legs have been presented. These contributions constitute rele-
vant ingredients for the computation of N3LOQCD corrections to equal-mass diboson production.

V V ′ + j
LH21 status: NLOQCD corrections known for many years [825–832]; Full NLOEW corrections
available [335,336] along with matching with parton shower with approximate EW corrections.

V V ′+ ≥2j
LH21 status:
Full NLOSM corrections (NLOQCD, NLOEW and mixed NLO) available for
W +W +jj [833, 834] and ZZjj [835, 836]; NLOQCD +NLOEW known for WZjj [837] and
W +W −jj [838]; NLOQCD corrections known for the EW production for all leptonic signatures in
the vector-boson scattering approximation [839–845]; Same holds true for the QCD production
modes [846–853]; NLOQCD calculated for WW + 3j [854];
All above computations matched to parton shower [855–863] (in the VBS approximation for EW
production); NLOEW to same-sign WW matched to parton/photon shower [864]. Comparative
study at NLOQCD and with parton-shower corrections for same-sign WW [865].
In Ref. [866], the final state W ±W ±jjj has been computed at NLOQCD matched to parton
shower. This allows a better description of observables using the third jet (in addition to the
two tagging jets), e.g. for jet veto in the central region in experimental analyses.
So far, most work in VBS has been focused on leptonic channels, but new results are becom-
ing available for semi-hadronic and fully hadronic signatures. For example, the implementation
of the NLOQCD corrections matched to parton shower for WZjj [863] in POWHEG has been
extended to allow to consider the semi-leptonic and fully hadronic channels [867]. Results are
shown for current and future possible hadron colliders up to 100 TeV. The spin-correlations and
off-shell effects are also studied. Along the same line, Ref. [868] presented results at LO for the
VBS production of ℓνjjjj using a double-pole approximation.
In Ref. [869], full NLOQCD +EW corrections have been presented for the W +W +jj, con-
firming the results of Ref. [833,834]. In addition, the NLOQCD corrections have been compared
to those in the double-pole and VBS approximations.
One of the key properties of the VBS is that it is particularly sensitive to the longitudinal
polarisations of heavy gauge bosons. In an effort to provide reliable predictions to experimental
collaborations for the extraction of polarisation fractions, NLOQCD +EW corrections have been
