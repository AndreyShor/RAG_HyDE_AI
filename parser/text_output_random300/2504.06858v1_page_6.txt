|g(1 + it)|2 = | cosh(x) cos(tx) + i sinh(x) sin(tx)|2
cosh2(x)
= cos2(tx) + tanh2(x) sin2(tx) ≤1 .
On the interior 0 < Re α < 1 the function is furthermore bounded
|g(α)| = |eαx + e−αx|
ex + e−x
= e(Re α−1)x|1 + e−2αx|
1 + e−2x
≤1 + e−2 Re αx ≤2 .
By the Hadamard three-lines theorem (or the Phragm´en–Linedl¨of principle on
vertical strips), we have that |g(α)| ≤1 for all α with 0 ≤Re α ≤1, which
proves (3.4).
As a consequence for any such α ̸= 0 and any y ∈R \ {0}

Applying this result with α = ω/π and y = πx/b we obtain that

sinh(ω

 ≤

sinh(π

for all ω ̸= 0 with 0 ≤Re ω ≤π and all x ∈R \ {0}. Rearranging yields the
desired result and the proof is complete.

Note that in [28] L. Faddeev and L. A. Takhtajan studied the resolvent in a
slightly different form
Gλ(x −y) =
σ
sinh(πiκ
σ )

e−2πiκ(x−y)
1 −e−4πiσ(x−y) +
e2πiκ(x−y)
1 −e4πiσ(x−y)

which coincides with (3.1) with σ = i/2b, λ = 2 cosh(2bπκ) and κ = ω−π
2πib .
It was also pointed out in [28] that the free resolvent can be written using the
analogues of the Jost solutions
f−(x, κ) = e−2πiκx
and
f+(x, κ) = e2πiκx
that appear in the theory of one-dimensional Schr¨odinger operators. Namely
Gλ(x −y) =
