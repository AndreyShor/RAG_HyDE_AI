Definition 2. (Vector Field in the Complex Plane).
Let U = {p ∈C} be a bounded region in the complex plane containing points
p(x, jy) ∈U. A vector field is a mapping F : U →2C defined by
F (p(x, jy)) = {⃗v} ∈2C denoted by ⃗V f.

Remark 1. A complex number z in polar form (discovered by Euler [6]) is written
z = rejθ .
■
Example 1. Three examples of vector fields in polar form are given in Fig. 1.
