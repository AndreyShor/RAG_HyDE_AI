extends into the bulk is ([y2],b).

Figure 7: A diagram of an a line connected to a c line. There is a topological point
operator at their junction, which connects to diﬀerent bulk anyons depending on
whether or not the eﬀective Z2 symmetry has an anomaly.
To see the consequence of this diﬀerence on the partial trace decomposition,
consider the diagram implied by Zm
a,m. There is an a line which we wish to map to
the identity using topological junction operators, akin to the calculations done in
Figure 6. In order to do so, we must pull that topological junction operator past
an m line, which has the potential to generate a phase. We can pinpoint what
this phase must be by imagining that the m line in question is raised oﬀof the
symmetry boundary, so that instead we are passing the bulk anyon connected to
that junction operator through the m line. For concreteness, assume that when
we gauge we take the symmetry boundary to be 1 ⊕eG ⊕eR ⊕eRG ⊕2mB, which
corresponds to (γa,γb,γc) = (−1,1,1). Then, in decompsing the partial trace Zm
a,m
to a multiple of Z1,g we need to pass the (1,a) = eRG anyon through the (1,m) = mB
anyon. These braid trivially, so we do not pick up any additional phases. However,
