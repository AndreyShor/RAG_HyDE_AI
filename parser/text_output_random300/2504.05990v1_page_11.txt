to the average of the population (i.e., all patients in a dataset). These are summarized via a 
summation.  
2.4 Statistical analysis 
We calculated the iHDIs for the lung parenchyma score for each group within each SDOH 
demographic correlate (sex and race) (see Table 1) and rounded each to two significant digits. 
Since the goal of this work was to introduce the concept of our novel image-based health disparities 
probe, we have chosen to present a relatively qualitative demonstration here, with more 
quantitative analyses to be the focus of future collaborations with HD researchers.

Results 
3.1 Phenogroups 
Unsupervised clustering on the surrogate features resulted in two clusters, i.e., phenogroups 
(Figure 4), with assignment of patients to one of the phenogroups (Table 2, Table 3). Note that the 
number of clusters was not determined a priori but rather through an unsupervised optimization 
routine within the clustering algorithm.
