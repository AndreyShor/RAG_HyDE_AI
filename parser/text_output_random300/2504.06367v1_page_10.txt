FIG. 8: Best-fit plot with individual 𝜒2 for each redshift bin for our default analysis (Gaussian 𝑇0 priors + 𝑅𝑠cdm) with four redshift dependent
parameters (𝑇0, 𝛾, 𝜏eff, 𝑢0) and fixed dark matter parameters, 𝑚WDM−1 and 𝑓WDM. The combined weighted 𝜒2 is 45.6/34.
the (𝑚WDM−1 −𝑓WDM) plane (bottom row); therefore, the 2𝜎
constraints for pure WDM (see Table II) are also very similar.
The addition of 𝜏CMB only slightly shrinks the posterior in the
thermal parameter space at 𝑧= 4.2, resulting in smoother 1𝜎
contours, but the inferred parameters are practically the same.
For mixed DM models, we find that 𝑓WDM ≲16%, 35%, 50%
and 67% for fixed 𝑚WDM = [1,2,3,4] keV, respectively, where
the choice of different thermal priors only changes these con-
straints by ≤5%.

FIG. 9: Marginalized mean of the posteriors and corresponding error
bars for 𝑇0 (𝑧) with other thermal evolution constraints. We show in
different tones of blue the inferred temperature and mean density for
a variety of analyses. The gray and pink bands show independent
measurements from [110] and [111]. The black line show the pre-
dicted evolution from our simulated models ([113]). Inferred values
from other works ([69], [62], [104] and [46]) are also shown. We
have shifted the redshift axis for each new measurement for visual
clarity.

Effect of small scale cut
The previous data sets used to infer the WDM constraints
extend to 𝑘≈0.1 s/km [46, 57, 114].
We check whether
we reproduce their results on pure WDM thermal relics by
performing an analysis with both uninformative and default
thermal priors and without the last 3 𝑘-bins in the data. These
scales are key to disentangle thermal effects from dark matter
free-streaming, meaning that without them, constraints in this
parameter space will be dominated by the priors. The best-fit
model for the default analysis with the small scale cut precisely
recovers 𝑇0𝑧𝑖, within the Gaussian prior’s peak. The case for
uninformed priors expands along the 𝑢0 −𝑇0 degeneracy axes,
effectively showing no sensitivity to these parameters at the
scales considered. The recovered 𝜒2 when including or not
including thermal priors are 12.3/20 and 11.6/20, respectively.
We further recover weaker constraints for pure 𝑚WDM < 3.67
and 𝑚WDM < 3.82 keV (2𝜎) for each analysis, consistent with
[46, 70]. In terms of mixed dark matter models, the scale cut
weakens the allowed 𝑓WDM by 15%, with a stronger effect for
𝑚WDM = 3 keV, where the difference is ≈30% as shown in
Figure 11.
C.
Effect of noise
The small scale power in the Lyman-𝛼power spectrum in-
cludes contributions from metal lines, instrumental resolution,
and potentially underestimated instrumental noise. As men-
tioned in Section II, we correct for instrumental resolution
and pixel size of the data following [69]. Furthermore, we
use the analysis results of [69] that corrects for the effect of
the intervening metal lines. However, to address instrumental
noise, [69] estimated the "noiseless" power spectrum by sub-
