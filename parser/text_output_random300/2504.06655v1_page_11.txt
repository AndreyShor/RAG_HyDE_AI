Where the NLOoscillating part will be the same as equation 8 and NLOstatic, the static part will 
be contributed by the interfacial potential and the phase mismatch due to the dispersion caused by 
the interfacial distribution of the solvents. 
Hence the NLOstatic can be defined as the signal due to the three incoming laser fields and the 
static electric field at the interface and also the contributions from the phase mismatching.
