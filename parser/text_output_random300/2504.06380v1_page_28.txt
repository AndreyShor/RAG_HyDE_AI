SI-Fig. 1: Loading device for B|| experiment in dilution fridge: a) Side and b) Front view of the wire
bonded device on a chip carrier loaded on a homemade chip holder. In this arrangement, the device plane
is parallel to the ‘Z’−axis. c) Side and d) The front view of the arrangement is attached to the cold finger
sitting on a ‘sample puck’ to load in the dilution fridge through the bottom loader. The magnetic field lines
generated by the superconducting magnet run parallel to the central axis of the sample puck/cold finger
(schematically shown by red arrows), making them parallel to the device plane.
