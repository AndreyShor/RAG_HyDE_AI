evolution tracks of the primaries with initial orbital periods of Pini = 10 d (left) and Pini = 100 d and a fixed mass-ratio of qini = 0.8. Tracks
calculated using our mass-loss recipe and the standard wind mass-loss rates are shown as solid and dashed lines, respectively. The individual stars
are color-coded by their current mass.
quence (He-ZAMS). In contrast, primaries calculated with the
new mass-loss recipe lose less mass and temporarily remain
between the He-ZAMS and H-ZAMS before becoming H-free
WN-type stars, which might help to explain the observed spread
in temperature of WR stars.
For the 60 M⊙primaries, the divergence between the tracks
is more pronounced. Models with the standard mass-loss rates
shed approximately 10 M⊙after mass-transfer, ending their lives
as WC-type stars. Meanwhile, primaries calculated with the new
mass-loss recipe lose only about 5 M⊙after mass transfer and
conclude their evolution as H-free WN stars, without transition-
ing to the WC phase. Such a huge difference in the mass dras-
tically alters predictions for the formation mass of black holes
in environments with different metallicities and hence, also has
implications for the merger rates of compact objects.
A similar pattern emerges in the LMC models. Binary evo-
lution models using the new mass-loss recipe fail to produce
WC-type stars under the explored initial conditions. However,
it remains plausible that WC stars could form when not us-
ing MLT++, with recalibrated mixing efficiencies, or in bina-
ries with shorter orbital periods where mass transfer is more ef-
ficient in removing the envelope. Interestingly, the few known
WC binaries in the LMC have orbital periods ranging between
2 d – 15 d (Bartzakos et al. 2001), suggesting that systems with
tighter initial configurations may favor WC star formation even
under the new mass-loss regime. Alternatively, as discussed in
Sect. 4.3.2 it remains possible that we underestimate the mass-
