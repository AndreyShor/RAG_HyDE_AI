where the Ut are i.i.d. standardized shocks.
Over many time steps, the cumulative sum
Pt
s=1 Us becomes approximately normal due to the central limit theorem, and more precisely,
the path of Xt (linearly interpolated) converges in distribution to a Brownian motion with
drift:
Xt ≈X0 −µt + σWt,
where Wt denotes standard Brownian motion.
This approximation becomes increasingly
accurate as t grows, provided the process is not absorbed.
While the truncation mechanism introduces complications, we again argue that the spe-
ciﬁc implementation of the trunction — whether discrete or continuous — does not aﬀect
our main results. Consequently, the continuous-time model remains a valid approximation
to the discrete-time process, even in the presence of truncation. The fact that both models
yield the same limiting behavior in Theorems 2 and 3 provides strong ex post justiﬁcation
for this approximation.
More general truncation mechanisms
The truncation criterion adopted in this paper — eliminating a branch when its squared am-
plitude φt(b) falls below a deterministic threshold ξt — is admittedly a stylized simpliﬁcation.
More broadly, the small-signal truncation mechanism should be viewed not as fundamental,
but as an emergent feature of deeper underlying dynamics (e.g. a fundamentally discrete
evolution, as previously suggested). In any case, we argue that the precise physical imple-
mentation of truncation is not essential for the emergence of the Born rule.
For example, one natural extension is to allow the truncation threshold to vary randomly
over time:
Xt =





Xt−1 −µ + σUt,
if Xt−1 −µ + σUt ≥log(Et),
−∞,
otherwise,
(23)
where Et are i.i.d. positive random variables independent of Ut.
If we parameterize the
random barrier as log(Et) = log ǫ+Vt, where log ǫ = E log(Et), then we expect the asymptotic
