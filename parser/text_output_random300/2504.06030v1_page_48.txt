S(x, t) = ˜St(Φ(x)),
˙Φt(x) = ∇S(Φt(x), t).
More properly this should be taken to define Φs with Φs=0 = id, s ∈(0, t), t ∈(0, T), T
sufficiently small.
Of course Φt ceases to be a diffeomorphism when det(DΦt(x)) = 0, i.e.

= 0,
i.e. when classical paths focus at a point forming caustics. We assume this does not
happen for 0 < t < T, for a global T, called the caustic time. We then have the result:
Theorem 5.2. (Elementary formula). Given that the no-caustic condition holds with a
caustic time T > 0, then for all t ∈[0, T),

Thus, from the Girsanov-Cameron-Martin theorem for the change of measure applied
to the Feynman-Kac formula,
