Then, we can do the same surgery as before to split the large loop eγ into two separated small
loops, that contain eη1 and eη2, respectively, such that E2(ε, r) occurs in the end (note that in
this subcase, the cost can depend on α or κ, but it is still independent of ε). This finishes
the proof in this case.
• Case (2). Exactly one cluster of Lr across Aε,r/2. If there already exists a cluster C of Lr
that crosses Aε,r/2, then we can reduce it to the case that C is not too big, that is, C ⊂B3r/4
(similar to the argument used in the proof of Lemma 5.9 in [13]). On the event EC
1 (ε, r),
there is a loop bγ that contains an excursion bη inside Br, which is connected to some other
cluster C′ inside Br/2, and furthermore, the filling of Λ(bη ∪C′, Lr) does not intersect C. Still,
we allow the remaining part bγ \ bη to intersect C. By a continuous version of separation lemma
associated with disconnection events (see Remark 4.5), analogous to Proposition 4.9 in [13],
we get that bη is separated from C at scale r. Hence, we can reconnect the endpoints of bη to
get a new loop, which is also separated from C. This implies E2(ε, r).
This completes the proof for EC
1 (ε, r).
The other possible case, indicated by the left part
of Figure 1.1, can be proved in a similar way by using an inward exploration and a continuous
version of the reversed separation lemma (corresponding to Proposition 4.8 in [13]), so we omit the
details.

Boundary case
Now, we give a corresponding separation lemma for Γ+. Suppose 0 < 2ε < r < 1/2. On the event
E+
2 (ε, r), there are two loops γ1 and γ2 that intersect both ∂Bε and ∂Br. Let G+
2 (ε, r) be the event
that the following conditions all hold
• γ1 ⊂Br ∪Br/10(reπi/4) \ Br/10(re3πi/4) and γ2 ⊂Br ∪Br/10(re3πi/4) \ Br/10(reπi/4),
• all the loops in Γ+ \ {γ1, γ2} that intersect D have diameter less than r/40.
Lemma 4.12. For κ ∈(8/3, 4], there exists a constant c > 0 such that for all 0 < 2ε < r < 1/2,
P(E+
2 (ε, r)) ≤c P(E+
2 (ε, r) ∩G+
2 (ε, r)).
The proof is similar to that of Proposition 4.1, and thus omitted. Using Lemma 4.12, and
adapting the proof of Lemma 4.11, it is not hard to derive the following result.
Lemma 4.13. For κ ∈(8/3, 4], we have
P(E+
1 (ε, r)) ≍P(E+
2 (ε, r)).
Proof. We only give a sketch of proof for the direction
P(E+
2 (ε, r)) ≲P(E+
1 (ε, r)).
First, by Lemma 4.12, we can replace the left-hand side by the event E+
2 (ε, r) ∩G+
2 (ε, r), which is
assumed to hold now. On this event, we can find a Brownian loop in Br/10(reπi/4)∪Br/10(re3πi/4)∪
Bc
r that surrounds both Br/20(reπi/4) and Br/20(re3πi/4), to realize the event E+
1 (ε, r). Note that
the total mass of such Brownian loops is positive and only depends on r. Thus, we conclude the
result immediately.
