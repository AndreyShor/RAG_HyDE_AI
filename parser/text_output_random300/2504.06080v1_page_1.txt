Abstract
Higher order calculations in chiral gauge theories such as the Electroweak Standard
Model require a sound treatment of the notoriously problematic γ5-matrix in Dimen-
sional Regularization (DReg). In the all-order consistent BMHV scheme anticom-
mutativity has to be sacriﬁced, resulting in spurious breakings of BRST invariance,
the restoration of which necessitates ﬁnite, symmetry-restoring counterterms. Fol-
lowing recent advances in successfully applying this scheme to multi-loop calculations
for Abelian models, we shall here present the ﬁrst complete non-Abelian two-loop
result for the case of SU(2), which is of particular interest to the Standard Model.
We provide the complete list of ﬁnite, two-loop symmetry restoring counterterms and
discuss intricacies of the non-Abelian implementation. Except for one novel term,
the ﬁnite counterterm action exhibits the same structure as at one-loop order.
