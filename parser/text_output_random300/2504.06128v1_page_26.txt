Proof of (4.17). Let us define a variant ˜Zoff
N,j of (4.15) where we only switch off disorder in
a given interval p ˜Nj, Njs, namely
for j “ 1, . . . , M :

It then suffices to estimate separately each term in this sum.
In order to prove (4.19), recall the polynomial chaos expansion (2.11) for the point-to-
plane partition function Zβ
Npxq, which yields a corresponding polynomial chaos expansion
for the averaged partition function Zβ
Npφq “ ř
xPZ2
even φpxq Zβ
Npxq. The polynomial chaos
expansion for Zoff
N from (4.15) is a subset of the polynomial chaos expansion for Zav
N : it is
obtained by restricting the sum to times n1, . . . , nk which avoid all intervals p ˜Nj, Njs for
j “ 1, . . . , M (see Remark 2.2), hence its variance admits a formula like (2.17) with the
same restriction on the sum. Then the difference Var

is given again by
formula (2.17) where the sequence of times n1, . . . , nk is now required to intersect at least
one of the intervals p ˜Nj, Njs for j “ 1, . . . , M. By a union bound, we obtain precisely (4.19).
Let us finally focus on a given term in the RHS of (4.19). Since Var

see (2.26), it is enough to show that

We recall that ˜Zoff
N,j corresponds to switching off disorder between AN “ ˜Nj and BN “ Nj.
It is instructive (and more transparent) to fix 0 ă a ď b ă 1 and consider general times
AN “ N pδ2ϱ

BN “ N pδ2ϱ
N q1´b`op1q “ N e´p1´bq ϱ |ϑN|`op|ϑN|q .
Later we will specialize to b “ a “ j´1
M due to the choice of Nj and ˜Nj in (4.5) and (4.6).
We compute Var

by formula (2.17) where the sum is restricted to times n1, . . . , nk
that do not intersect the interval pAN, BNs. We split Var

‚ part I1: all times ni take place before AN;
‚ part I2: all times ni take place after BN;
‚ part I3: the first time n1 takes place before AN, the last time nk takes place after BN.
The first contribution I1 is nothing but the variance of the averaged partition function of
polymer length AN, that is (recall (4.1))
