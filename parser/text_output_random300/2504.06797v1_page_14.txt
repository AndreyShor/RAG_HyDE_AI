Figure 1: Running of the gauge couplings of the standard model, which asymptotically reach
constant values.
Implications for the standard model.
Within the multifractal spacetime, the standard model
becomes automatically finite at any order in perturbation theory and avoids UV Landau poles.
Consequently, it achieves asymptotic safety and remains valid at all scales—see [36] for an
in-depth discussion on the asymptotic safety paradigm in QFT. For example, figure 1 illustrates
the one-loop running of the standard model’s gauge couplings.
It’s worth commenting on the nature of asymptotic safety shown in Fig. 1. Wilson first
argued for the necessity of a non-trivial UV fixed point for theoretical consistency [37]. In
our case – QFT with diminishing dimension – the UV fixed point is reached only at infinity.
Nevertheless, the couplings remain finite and possibly small. While the fixed point is attained
at infinite energy, the running exponentially converges to a constant value. Additionally, as
explained previously for the ϕ4 model, the absence of UV renormalons enhances perturbation
theory’s robustness.
Last but not least, as illustrated in (42), the multifractal QFT predicts direction-dependent
cross-sections. Phenomenologically, within the standard model, this would probably be the
most striking “smoking gun” signal of the underlying space-time fractality. In parallel, the
Lorentz violating aspects of the proposed scenario should be phenomenologically bounded,
being this kind of studies an active research field [38]. A detailed phenomenological analysis is
beyond the scope of this work.

Conclusions and outlook
Motivated by the possibility that spacetime’s effective dimension may evolve with energy scale,
we have explored this concept from a quantum field theory perspective, particularly within
canonical quantization. Crucially, consistency of the quantum field theory points to a quantum
