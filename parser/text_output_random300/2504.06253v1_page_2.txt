QAOA falls under the broader class of quantum algorithms called Variational Quantum Algorithms [4], which
all use this hybrid quantum-classical optimization loop to minimize a cost function evaluated on a quantum circuit.
For current and near-term quantum devices, it is important to be mindful of the circuit depth since an in-
crease in circuit depth and gate count as the former will causing to an increase in total runtime leading to
increased decoherence and the latter will cause an increase in the compounded gate errors. Tate et al. [5, 6]
developed a “warm-start" heuristic that modifies the initial quantum state of QAOA from |+⟩⊗𝑛(the uniform
superposition of all bitstrings) to warm-start initial state that is designed to be biased towards better solutions.
The idea is that with an improved initial state, fewer QAOA layers (and hence fewer gates and lower circuit
depths) are needed to transform the initial state into a quantum state whose measurement yields good solutions,
and indeed, this was what has been empirically observed.
In particular, when solving Max-Cut problems, one can relax the problem into a semidefinite program (SDP) as
is done in the Goemans-Williamson algorithm [7]; the SDP is a convex problem that can be solved efficiently
and Tate et al. uses the solutions from this SDP relaxation (which are high-dimensional vectors) to construct the
warm-start initial quantum state.[6].
Around the same time that Tate et al. [6] developed their warm-start approach, Egger et al. [8] had inde-
pendently developed their own warm-start approaches. For any given QUBO, one of their approaches considers a
simple QUBO-relaxation that relaxes the integer constraints 𝑥𝑖∈{0, 1} of the QUBO to an interval constarint
𝑥𝑖∈[0, 1]; the optimal solutions from the QUBO-relxation are then used to generate a warm-started quantum
state. If the matrix defining the QUBO satisfies certain criteria, the relaxation is convex and can thus be solved
efficiently; however, for general QUBOs, solving this relaxation is known to be NP-Hard [9]. For an arbitrary
QUBO, one possible approach is to perform the above QUBO-relaxation and to find an approximate optimal
solution (of the relaxation) via local optimization.
Alternatively, this work proposes a new approach: a mapping that takes arbitrary QUBOs and maps them
to equivalent Max-Cut instances. Using the warm-start approach of Tate et al. [5, 6], these Max-Cut problems
can be solved to obtain solutions that can then be mapped back to solutions for the original QUBO.
This “QUBO to Max-Cut” mapping introduces an additional auxiliary qubit/variable. In Tate et al.’s approach, a
global rotation is typically applied to the solution of the SDP relaxation before mapping it to a warm-started
initial quantum state. They propose a vertex-at-top heuristic where the global rotation rotates one of the qubits
so that it is on top of the Bloch sphere in the warm-start quantum state. However, some choices of vertices are
better than others, and hence, an 𝑂(𝑛) overhead (where 𝑛is the number of vertices) is required to test all possible
vertex-at-top rotations. Interestingly, when mapping a QUBO to a Max-Cut instance, we find that the auxiliary
qubit is frequently the best choice of qubit for the vertex-at-top heuristic; this observation can be used to reduce
the overhead of trying multiple random vertices in the vertex-at-top heuristic.
We empirically compare the two warm-start approaches above for a variety of different types of QUBOs up to 16
variables. The QUBOs we test come from randomly generated matrices or QUBOs that arise from specific problems
in combinatorial optimization (e.g. portfolio optimization, traveling salesman, and maximum independent set).
We find that the best warm-start approach is highly problem-dependent and also dependent on the metric of
success (e.g. approximation ratio vs probability of finding the optimal solution).
