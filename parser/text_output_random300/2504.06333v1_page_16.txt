Clearly, Hopf algebras are special cases of quasi-Hopf algebras, where Φ =
1 ⊗1 ⊗1, and α = β = 1.
Less trivial examples of quasi-Hopf algebras are given by pairs (G,α) for G
a ﬁnite group and α ∈Z3(G,U(1)) a group 3-cocycle. The bialgebra structure
is given by the dual group algebra CG and coassociator is simply the 3-cocycle
ω ∈CG ⊗CG ⊗CG viewed as a three-parameter C×-valued function on G. We will
denote this quasi-Hopf algebra as CG
α.
Now, we come to the notion of gauge twist, which as we argued above, is the
correct equivalence relation for classifying ’t Hooft anomalies in representation
categories of quasi-Hopf algebras. Given a quasi-Hopf algebra (H,∆,ǫ,S,α,β),
a gauge twist is an invertible element F = ∑j F (1)

Note that the notion of a Drinfeld twist [14] is a special case of a gauge twist,
with the crucial diﬀerence that while the Drinfeld twist of a Hopf algebra is again
a Hopf algebra, the gauge twist of a Hopf algebra is generally only a quasi-Hopf
algebra.
Gauge twists are important for the theory of representation categories because
if a pair H1,H2 of quasi-Hopf algebras are gauge equivalent, meaning there is a
gauge twist F ∈H1 ⊗H1 such that HF
1 ≅H2, then their representation categories
are tensor equivalent Rep(H1) ≅Rep(H2). In particular, this says that a quasi-
Hopf algebra with a coassociator that is not of the form 1⊗1⊗1 (as that of a Hopf
algebra) might still have a representation category that admits a ﬁber functor.
Intuitively, a coassociator Φ coming from a gauge twist F is trivial in the same
sense that a group anomaly 3-cocycle is trivial if it is a 3-coboundary.
