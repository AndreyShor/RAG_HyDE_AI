that has a zero Ricci scalar, so the Ricci scalar term will be absent. Writing Gϕ(x, x′) in terms of scalar Wightman
function, Wϕ(x, x′), we have [54; 52]
iSF
αβ(x, x′) = θ(t −t′)[iγµ(x)∇x
µ + m]αβWϕ(x, x′) + θ(t′ −t)[iγµ(x)∇x
µ + m]αβWϕ(x′, x).
(10)
Again, relativistic causality ensures that the Feynman propagator (10) is analytic at equal times, and furthermore, the
first time derivative is also continuous at equal times. Comparing the above equation, Eq.(10), with Eq.(7), we get the
following expressions for the Wightman function of the Dirac field:
S+
αβ(x, x′) = [iγµ(x)∇x
µ + m]αβWϕ(x, x′),
S−
αβ(x, x′) = −[iγµ(x)∇x
µ + m]αβWϕ(x′, x).

Here 1 is the identity matrix. Using the property of conformal invariance, discussed above, we get the following Wightman
function for the massless Dirac field in any spacetime which is conformally related to the (1+1) D Minkowski spacetime

Different vacuua
One usually defines a vacuum state as a Gaussian pure state. The term ‘pure’ means that one cannot decompose the
state into a convex combination of other states, and the Gaussian states are states that can be fully described by their
one and two-point correlation functions. Generally, it’s not anticipated that the vacuum should be devoid of particles
for observers following distinct worldlines. Nevertheless, the symmetries inherent in spacetime dictate the emergence of
certain mode sets as natural choices for specific observers. Guided by the principles of normalization and equivalence,
one opts for Hadamard states, which are physical states that exhibit a resemblance to the Minkowski vacuum in the
high-energy ultraviolet (UV) limit. In a stationary spacetime with a bifurcate Killing horizon, one can identify at most
one stationary Hadamard vacuum (see theorem 5.1 of [58]). One can refer [59] for the detailed discussion of states using
massless Dirac fields in the Schwarzschild spacetime. For ease of application in the later sections where we use the
detectors coupled to the scalar density of the massless fermionic field, this section delves into an exploration of three
distinct vacuum states associated with the Schwarzschild spacetime 2 and their corresponding two-point functions

Here :: represents the normal ordering, and α denotes different states. The second expression (16) has been derived
in Appendix [A]. One finds that the two-point function now depends on the choice of 2-bein b.µ

ϕ (x, x′) is the Whitman function of a massless scalar field in the corresponding
vacua.

HHI vacuum
In the eternal Schwarzschild spacetime, there exists exactly one stationary Hadamard vacuum state, which is defined
over the entire maximally extended spacetime, known as the Hartle-Hawking-Israel (HHI) state [60]. One understands
2We note that only one is Hadamard over the maximally extended Schwarzschild spacetime. Moreover, uniqueness does not necessarily imply
existence in a more general scenario [58].
