(a) Maximum linear growth rates extracted from wave number space for each plasma
state, characterize by β∥e and T⊥/T∥. The red dashed line represents γmax = 10−2 ωce, indicating
the threshold of whistler anisotropy instability. (b) Wave frequency and (c) wave normal angle
corresponding to the maximum linear growth rate for each plasma state shown in (a). Solid arrows
in (b) sketch the potential evolution path of plasma states in our experiments, while the dashed
arrow points to the quasi-steady state with stable whistler wave excitation.
cles crossing this boundary are reinjected into the simulation with the same initial thermal
velocity. Absorbing boundary conditions are applied to all wave fields.
Results show that the electrons are gradually heated in the perpendicular direction due
to ECRH (see Figure 4(d) and Supplementary video [48]), increasing their temperature
anisotropy. The microwave penetration depth, inferred from the thermal velocity ratio in
Figure 4(a), is ∼5 de, in agreement with theoretical predictions and previous experiments
[34]. When the electron temperature anisotropy exceeds the instability threshold, whistler
waves are excited, as seen in Figures 4(b) and 4(c). Following whistler wave onset, the
electron parallel temperature increases as the anisotropy relaxes.
Figures 4(e) and 4(f)
illustrate the evolution of the electron distribution near the equator. Before whistler wave
