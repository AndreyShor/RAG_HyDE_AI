4.2. Step 2: almost diffusive approximation. In this step, we prove the second
relation in (4.3):

Let Dm be the event that the random walk is “almost diffusive” at time m, in the following
sense:

(4.23)
We define Zdiff
N
by restricting Zoff
N in (4.15) to the event ŞM
j“0 D ˜
Nj X DNj. It is actually
useful to define Zdiff
N,i for each scale Ni, see (4.5) (note that Ni “ N for i “ M):
for i “ 1, . . . , M :

Let us prove (4.22). Since |Zoff

We recall that under Pp ¨ | S0 „ Uδϱ

and (4.6), for m ě ˜N1 we can bound δϱ

Then (4.22) holds because for any m P t ˜N1, N1, . . . , ˜NM, NMu, we can use Gaussian tail

This concludes the proof of (4.22).
4.3. Step 3: polymer distribution. In this step we give a convenient representation
for the ratio Zdiff
N,i{Zdiff
N,i´1 in terms of a directed polymer. This will be exploited to estimate
the moments of ∆N,i, see (4.9).
Let us introduce the polymer endpoint distribution µN,ip¨q at time Ni, corresponding to
the partition function Zdiff
N,i in (4.24):
for i “ 1, . . . , M and x P Z2
