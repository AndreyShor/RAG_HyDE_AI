Extend Data Fig.1 | Verification of ocean currents in coupled reanalyses. a–b, Argo period (2000–2023) 
temporal mean distributions of 950–1150 m ocean current velocities (unit: cm/s) in CESM-HIS and CM2-HIS, 
respectively. c–g, Same as a–b but for CESM-CDA, CM2-CDA, SODA3, ECCO4 and ORAS5, respectively. h, 
Argo-drifting estimated ocean current velocities (unit: cm/s) for 950–1150 m ocean depth [34]. i, The distribution 
of average ocean current velocities with latitude at 950–1150 m. j, Same as panel i, but for root mean square errors 
(RMSEs).
