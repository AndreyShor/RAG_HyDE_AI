obscure expression for β in Theorem 1 simpliﬁes elegantly to β = µ/σ2, where µ and σ
are given in (13) — or more speciﬁcally in (12). The assumptions across both theorems
correspond naturally — for instance, the condition δ < α translates to µ > 0 here.
Secondly, and more signiﬁcantly, this stochastic process representation broadens the scope
of the branching model considerably. It shows that the power-law relationship between initial
conditions and survival probabilities holds across a wide class of processes characterized by
negative drift and absorption. This generality is further explored in Subsection 4.3 below.
For future reference, it is helpful to express the coeﬃcient β in an alternative form.
Notably, the parameter µ is not fundamental to the branching model, but instead decomposes
as µ = log α + eµ, where log α captures the rate of decay of the exogenous threshold ξt = ǫαt,
and eµ = −E log(∆t) is the drift of the logged process log Φt. Substituting this decomposition
into (15), we obtain:
β = eµ + log α
σ2
.
(16)
This form highlights the relationship between the power-law exponent β, the decay rate α
of the threshold, and parameters eµ and σ characterizing the branching process. Achieving
β = 1 requires the threshold rate to satisfy log α = σ2 −eµ, which generalizes equation (10).
Heuristic Proof of Theorem 2.
Consider the process Xt that evolves according to
equation (14). Without the absorbing barrier, Xt would be a simple random walk:
X∗
t = X∗
t−1 −µ + σ Ut = X0 −µ t + σ
t
X
s=1
Us .
By the central limit theorem, under our assumptions on Ut, for large t, the sum t−1/2 Pt
s=1 Us
converges to Z ∼N (0, 1), a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. Therefore, for
large t, X∗
t itself is approximately distributed as X0 −µ t + σ t1/2 Z, which is a normally
distributed random variable with mean X0 −µ t and variance σ2 t.
