results for TBj we take rs = 1 in eq. (3.1), whilst for TCj we take rs = 2, following ref. [17].

Drell-Yan Jet Veto Predictions
We present in figure 8 and figure 9 our predictions for the NLL′ + NLO and NNLL′ +
NNLO Drell-Yan cross section, for TBj < T cut and TCj < T cut respectively. We use the
MaxDev prescription for the resummation uncertainty as discussed in section 4.2. One
observes that, under this prescription, the NNLL′ uncertainty band is smaller than the
NLL′ band (above the ‘nonperturbative region’ as defined in section 3), and the bands
overlap (unlike the ‘standard’ uncertainty bands in figure 3). Note that, as discussed in
section 4, the theoretical uncertainties at NLL′ + NLO are likely still under predicted,
whilst those at NNLL′ + NNLO should be reasonable.
We compare our resummed predictions with fixed-order NNLO π2-improved cross sec-
tion predictions in figure 10 for TBj and TCj vetoes. The uncertainty bands on the NNLO
predictions are simply obtained by the variation of µFO by a factor of 2 around MZ, so we
do not expect them to be reliable for T cut ≪MZ. We see that the central predictions for
NNLO and fixed NNLL′+NNLO differ appreciably below around 20 GeV – this is roughly
consistent with figures 1 and 2, where the singular contributions dominate in this region
(recall that we set the end of the resummation region to be ∼18 GeV). At very small values
of T cut, the fixed order prediction actually becomes completely unphysical (< 0), whilst
our resummed prediction goes to zero as expected. At large T cut, we find that our matched
NNLL′ + NNLO predictions precisely coincide with the fixed order ones, as required.
In table 2, we present cross section values in the presence of a TB/Cj veto, for T cut =
10, 20, 30 GeV, at various fixed order and resummed accuracies. For the resummed predic-
