FIG. 34. The same as Figure 10 for the first lepton-energy
moment. Data for the ¯cs and ¯cd are displayed together.
ables P(p)
σ
are shown in Figures 41 and 42 for the first and
second lepton-energy moment respectively. Again, P(p)
σ
is very small and |P(p)
σ | < 0.5 in all the cases showing the
goodness of the σ 7→0 extrapolations.
Figure 43 shows the quantity dM1, ¯
fg/dω2 for the ¯cs (top-
panel) and ¯cd (bottom-panel) channels. The analogous
plot for the second lepton-energy moment is displayed
in Figure 44. Our final results for the differential lep-
ton energy moments are shown in Figures 32 and 45, re-
spectively. Finally, Figure 33 shows the error budget of
dM1, ¯
fg/dω2 for the ¯cs (top-panel) and ¯cd (bottom-panel)
channels. The corresponding plots for the second lepton-
energy moment are shown in Figure 46. Analogously to
what we found in the case of the decay rate, also for
lepton-energy moments the main source of uncertainty is
the statistical one.

Appendix B: Experimental measurements of the
branching-ratios and the decay rate
The experimental decay rate is given by
Γexp = Γexp
tot · Bexp(D+
s 7→Xe+νe),
(B1)
where
Bexp(D+
s
7→
Xe+νe)
is
the
experimental
branching-ratio for the semileptonic mode and Γexp
tot is
the total decay rate of the Ds meson. By using for the
mean lifetime the of Ds meson the value τ = 501.2(2.2)×
