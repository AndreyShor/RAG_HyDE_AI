Main results

since the field eΥλ is itself defined by a singular conditioning proving this fact would require additional
effort. Since our main result does not require ruling out the existence of bad values, we will not
investigate this fact further. In any case, we have to exclude at most countably many points, so Λ is
dense.
Definition 2.7. For λ ∈Λ, we let Ψλ be the field on Rd uniquely characterised by the fact that, for all
F ∈Cb(C(Rd)),
E[F(Ψλ)] ∝E

where x⋆= argmax{eΥλ(x) : x ∈Rd} and the proportionality constant is chosen in such a way that
E[1] = 1.
Remark 2.8. The fact that the proportionality constant in the previous definition lies in (0, ∞) is
proved in Lemma 5.6.
We now state the following key “resampling property” of the field eΥλ, whose proof is given in
Section 5.2.
Proposition 2.9. For each λ ∈Λ and for all F ∈Cb
loc(C(Rd)), it holds that
E[F(eΥλ)] = E

where we recall that x⋆= argmax{eΥλ(x) : x ∈Rd}.
Remark 2.10. In fact, Proposition 2.9 is quite general and applies to a large class of Gaussian fields
of the form Φ −ηa where Φ is centred with E[(Φ(x) −Φ(y))2] = a(x −y). In particular, one can
replace the field eΥλ in (2.9) by a drifted, conditioned Brownian motion. Specifically, for λ > 0 and
η ≥0, let (Xλ,η
t
)t∈R be a two-sided Brownian motion with drift t 7→−η|t| for t ∈R, conditioned to
remain below λ at all times. When η > 0 this is a condition that happens with positive probability,
while the case η = 0 can be covered by a limiting procedure, yielding a two-sided three-dimensional
Bessel process. Furthermore, consider the set
Aλ,η

and let ρλ,η be the (random) probability measure on Aλ,η defined as follows

Then, if t⋆is a point sampled from the probability measure ρλ,η, we have the identity in law
(Xλ,η

law= (Xλ,η

)t∈R ,
which we were unable to find in the existing literature. Note that, in particular, when η = 0, the
probability measure ρλ,0 is the uniform measure on Aλ,0.
Now, returning to our setting, we observe that, thanks to Proposition 2.9, an alternative way to
characterise Ψλ is by inverting (2.8). More precisely, we have the following result, whose proof is
given in Section 5.2.
