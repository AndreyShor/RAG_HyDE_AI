Figure 10. The Lomb-Scargle periodograms of the γ-ray (left panel) and ASAS-SN (right panel) observations of the blazar ON
246 are shown. The figure presents the LSPs of the original light curves (black) and spectral windows (pink). The significance
levels (blue) of the dominant observed peaks in both periodograms are estimated using DRW synthetic light curves.
The
detected peaks at 0.00105 day−1 (∼950 days) and 0.00105 day−1 (∼950 days) in γ-ray and ASAS-SN observations exceed 3σ
and 4σ significance levels, respectively. The shaded regions in both figures represent the invalid areas estimated using the mean
cadence and baseline of the light curves. Logarithmic versions of the periodograms are provided in the sub-figures.
propagates outward along the jet, it expands with an
average velocity (¯vexp). Since the expansion velocity is
non-relativistic (¯vexp << ¯vjet, where ¯vjet is the rela-
tivistic jet velocity), we have the condition D0 ≲DR.
Following Equation 12, we can express this relationship
as:
D0 ≲DR ⩽δ∆tobs
min
1 + z c
(21)
where ∆tobs
min is the observed minimum timescale of vari-
ability. Relativistic jets are believed to originate from
the inner regions of the accretion disk, close to the cen-
tral black hole (R. D. Blandford & R. L. Znajek 1977;
R. D. Blandford & D. Payne 1982; D. L. Meier et al.
2001). The inner radius of the disk is typically assumed
to be near the marginally stable orbit, also known as the
innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). The ISCO radius
(rms) is expressed in terms of the gravitational radius
(rg) and the dimensionless spin parameter j = J/Jmax,
where the maximum angular momentum is given by
Jmax = GM 2
∗/c, as defined in Equation 5 of H. Liu
& J. Bai (2015). For a Schwarzschild black hole (j = 0,
non-rotating), the ISCO is located at rms = 6rg, where
