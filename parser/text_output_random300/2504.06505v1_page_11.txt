FIG. 4. Comparison of coarse-grained (CG) models run with Langevin dynamics and all-atom (AA) simulations. Each 
panel shows results from two CG models initialized with different parameters, represented in orange and green. (A) 
Radial distribution function; (B) Three-body correlation; (C) Mean squared displacement. The results from the AA 
simulations are displayed in blue. Transparent curves indicate results from the initial models, while solid curves 
represent those from the trained models. 
 
We also evaluated the effect of increasing the CG integration timestep on simulation stability and 
dynamic fidelity. Figure 5 presents the MSD of the CG model with different timestep choices. The CG 
model was trained using a timestep 2.5 times that of the all-atom (AA) simulation. Notably, the MSD curve 
of the CG model remains close to the AA reference even when the timestep is increased to 5 times the AA 
timestep. However, we observed that further increasing the timestep leads to unstable simulations. 
Nevertheless, these results suggest that we can improve the computational efficiency of the CG model by 
increasing the CG timestep while still maintaining dynamical accuracy. By identifying the largest stable 
timestep, our method enables longer simulations with reduced computational cost, making it a valuable tool 
for studying largescale biomolecular systems.
