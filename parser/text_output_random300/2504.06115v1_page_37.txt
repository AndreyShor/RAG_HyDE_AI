6.2
Integral basis and monodromies
Using a basis of solutions (3.7) that is annihilated by the Picard-Fuchs operator (6.1), we
obtain the ﬂat coordinate (3.9) and in terms of q = e2πit we ﬁnd that the inverted mirror map
takes the form
z(q) = q −q2 (32 −6v−) + q3 (345 −805v−) −q4 (11650 −77220v−) + O(q5) .
(6.13)
We have veriﬁed to order 300 that the coeﬃcients take values in Z[v−].
We now want to assume that there is a basis of solutions that takes the form (3.11), (3.12)
for some values N, κ, σ, b and that has integral monodromy around all of the singular points.
The monodromy matrices can be calculated using numerical analytic continuation and we
denote the monodromy around z = zc,1 by f
MC,1. It turns out that this is only real if we set
ǫ = −4.7490038227443091059086866245 . . . .
(6.14)
The resulting matrix then takes the form
f
MC,1 =

(6.15)
One immediately sees that the only possible values for (N, κ) are (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 25) and
(5, 1). However, if we assume that N = 1 then we do not know how to interpret the value for
ǫ. Therefore we ﬁx N = 5 and κ = 1. We then observe that the value (6.14) can be written
as (3.13),
ǫ =ζ(3)

with χ( e
X) = −120, n1 = 30 and n2 = 20. The Euler characteristic χ = −120 and the triple
intersection number κ = 1 can be recognized as being those of the complete intersection
X(6,6) ⊂P5
1,1,2,2,3,3 .
(6.17)
We therefore propose that the Picard-Fuchs operator (6.1) can be interpreted as annihilating
the periods of the mirror of a Q-factorial degeneration X of X(6,6) with n1 + n2 = 50 isolated
nodes that carries a Z5 B-ﬁeld. Moreover, we claim that there is an analytic small resolution
ρ : b
X →X such that H2( b
X, Z) = Z×Z5 and the exceptional curves resolving 30 of the nodes
represent the class (0, [1]5) while 20 nodes are resolved by exceptional curves that represent
the class (0, [2]5).
