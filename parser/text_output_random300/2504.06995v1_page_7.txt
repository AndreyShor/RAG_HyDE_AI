Left: Pulse-width measurement from the MEMS chopping system at warm temperature with a 660 nm LED. Right:
Pulse width from the MEMS chopping system at cold temperature.
Combining the known geometry, component values,
and resonant frequency constraint, an estimate of the
minimum achievable pulse duration can be readily cal-
culated in terms of LED wavelength λ, assuming oscil-
lation at the resonant frequency, assuming the system is
geometrically optimal for pulsed measurement:
tpulse,ideal ≳2.4µs
p
1 + (0.31λ · 106)2
(8)
The diffraction correction for optical wavelengths is at
the percent level, and thus equation 9 implies a mini-
mum pulse width of ∼2.4 µs at 650 nm for a perfectly
optimized drive signal and exactly aligned optics.
A large caveat is that the mirror positions in this sys-
tem were designed around larger NA fiber optics for the
first mems version. As a result, the mirror position (la ∼
84mm) is substantially shorter than the maximum dis-
tance the mirror could be positioned. Using equation 6,
we find that for the geometry implemented here, we have
tpulse ≳4.0µs
p
1 + (0.31λ · 106)2
(9)
Thus, even without re-optimization, our existing scanner
should be able to produce ∼4µs-scale pulse widths.
Note that equation 9 sets the minimum obtainable
pulse width for the current set-up, but pulses can be
tuned above this value to arbitrarily slow pulse widths
and long duty cycles by simply adjusting the harmonic
drive frequency of the MEMS mirror.
For the case of
the square drive, we are thus testing the highest achiev-
able mirror drive frequency while retaining the filtering
needed to produce stable MEMs control. While we ex-
pect we could achieve results close to this limiting value
by removing hardware filtering, we would risk mirror
damage, and opted to keep these limits in place for this
test.
To measure the pulse chopping time using the output
plate, the y-position of the mirror was set to the centroid
of the beam spot and the x-position was set to oscillate
with time, driven by the filtered square wave as discussed
above. The APD output signals were used as a scope
trigger.
After signal averaging, the data were fit to a
Gaussian profile to extract the 4σ pulse width for each
wavelength. Example pulse-width measurements made
at both 300 K and 10 mK for 660 nm photons are shown
in Figure 5. Results from similar measurements made at
10 mK for different λ are summarized in Table I. We note
that the warm measurements are 50–100% higher than
our predicted minimum value of 4µs, while the cold values
are less than 15% higher than our predicted limit, with a
wavelength-dependent trend consistent with an increase
due to the astigmatism effects discussed earlier. We ex-
plore the reason for this difference in the next section, as
it requires comparing the pulse width to measured spot
size to separate focusing and temporal effects.
Due to limitations in performance of the APD and
fibers in the IR regime, as well as the measured (in situ)
∼7x reduction in fiber optic light transmission with the
scanner operating at cryogenic temperatures compared
to 300 K, cold pulses were indistinguishable from noise
for 940-nm and 970 nm sources. We note, however, that
although the IR pulses were not detected by the APD
in our tests, a cryogenic detector coupled to the scanner
unit for detector characterization would be sensitive to
these smaller energy deposits. We discuss our extensive
fiber optic testing performed to cross-check these results
in Appendix A. We find that this reduction is not due
to any property of the reflective optics, but a reduction
in transmission in the Thorlabs fibers due to jacket com-
pression when cold. The 100µm fiber shows substantially
worse temperature dependence and is the leading cause of
increased attenuation when cold. We anticipate that just
replacing the thorlabs fiber with our standard Accuglass
fibers would yield a 20x higher SNR than this measure-
ment based on the tests discussed in the appendix.
