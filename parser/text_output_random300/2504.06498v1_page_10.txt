Figure 1: The concept of a zero-field 𝐽-oscillator. (A) Schematic representation of the real-
time programmable feedback loop used for observing 𝐽-oscillators; the signal from hyperpolarized
molecules is detected by an optically pumped magnetometer (OPM), processed digitally with de-
fined feedback delay (𝜏) and gain (𝐺ext), and reapplied to the molecules via a piercing solenoid.
(B) Energy-level diagram of the 𝐽-coupling transitions of [15N]-acetonitrile ([15N]-ACN) at zero
field. (C) [15N]-ACN is hyperpolarized in situ at zero field via SABRE; the Ir-based catalyst
facilitates spontaneous spin-order transfer from parahydrogen (para-H2) to the population imbal-
ances in the target molecules. (D) Experimentally recorded quantum oscillator time-domain signal;
observation of the spontaneous emergence (< 100 s) and subsequent steady-state (SS) coherent
oscillation is obtained with 𝜏= 222 ms and 𝐺ext = +20. (E) Real part of the Fourier transform of
the SS oscillation (100–3100 s); the inset shows a 𝛿-function-like peak at the 2-𝐽frequency with a
measurement-time-limited FWHM of 337 𝜇Hz (Δ 𝑓is referenced to 3.374 Hz). (G-H) conventional
time-domain and frequency-domain zero-field NMR signals from the same sample.
