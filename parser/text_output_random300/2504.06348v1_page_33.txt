Figure 3: High level circuit for block-encoding the Hamiltonian HPI in Eq. (3). Note that we have shown
the block-encoding of the kinetic terms individually for conceptual clarity in viewing the target registers,
but they are jointly block-encoded (and equivalently for the Coulomb terms).
3. Apply SWUPel, a unitary that controlled on the i, j labels of the second register, swaps the ith and 1st
electron momentum registers, and swaps the jth and 2nd electron momentum registers. Then apply
SWUPion, a unitary that controlled on the I, J labels of the second register swaps the Ith and 1st
pseudoion momentum registers, and swaps the Jth and 2nd pseudoion momentum registers.
4. Conditioned on label p from the first register, apply on the first two electron and the first two pseudoion
momentum registers, the block-encoding of the single or two-particle versions of the kinetic, Coulomb,
local and non-local terms, as indicated in Fig. 3. Note that these block-encodings bring in further
ancilla qubits that are not represented.
5. Uncompute the controlled SWUPs, and all of the state preparation unitaries.
The resulting unitary acts as H/λ on the momentum registers, when conditioned on the qubits of the first
two registers as well as the ancilla flags in each of the block-encoding pieces being |0⟩. The costs for the
shared subroutines across all block-encoding terms are given in Table 2.

Table 2: The resource costs for the subroutines shared across all terms in the block encoding, assuming the
compilation scheme in App. E.1. The parameters n and ¯n were introduced in Eq. (21) and (24), respectively,
ηion is the total number of pseudoions and ηval the total number of valence electrons. The parameters in red
(defined in Appendix E) are tunable, and must be chosen to satisfy an overall error budget for the block
encoding.
