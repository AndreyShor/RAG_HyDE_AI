ASHiTA with two iterations for the high-level task of "Quick bathroom cleaning". (b) From the initial hierarchy, only the toilet is successfully
grounded in the generated scene graph. From this iteration, the suggestions of "door", "sink", "towel rack", and "tiles" are generated. These suggestions are
used to update the task hierarchy, successfully recovering part of the human-annotated reference task hierarchy (recall that our evaluation is object-centric,
as discussed in Sec. 5).
8. Qualitative Examples
8.1. SG3D Hierarchical Task Analysis
We include some qualitative examples of ASHiTA with the
SG3D [50] high-level tasks in the HM3DSem [47] dataset.
In Fig. 7, ASHiTA is given a single high-level task of "mea-
sure weight", and is able to correctly identify the scale.
Note that ASHiTA is an object-centric approach and does
not refine or evaluate on the specific description of the sub-
tasks. In Fig. 6 we show ASHiTA at a larger scale in a
kitchen and a dining room for "set dining table for a meal",
ASHiTA comes up with reasonable subtasks and identified
relevant items associated with the task. Lastly, in Fig. 8, the
task given is "watch late-night show on TV", ASHiTA also
mostly identifies the correct subtasks and items. A few mis-
takes are: selecting the TV in the neighboring dining room
instead of the bedroom, and associating the non-item word
"channel" to the bed. Note that ASHiTA is also able to clus-
ter the two primitives (green) together for the "couch" item.
8.2. Detailed Example of ASHiTA
In this section, we demonstrate in detail the alternating it-
erations of ASHiTA with specific examples from the SG3D
dataset. In Fig. 10 we show the comparison between the ini-
tial task hierarchy given to ASHiTA, the final task hierarchy,
and the reference task hierarchy from SG3D [50] alongside
two iterations of ASHiTA. In the first iteration, only the sub-
task related to the toilet is grounded in the scene graph, but
incorporating the suggestions from this iteration, the task
hierarchy is refined and we end up with four grounded sub-
tasks.
In Fig. 11 we give ASHiTA the task of "inspect
the cleanliness of the utility area". With three iterations,
ASHiTA is able to incorporate a more complete grounded
set of relevant objects and subtasks.
8.3. Rooms and Objects
While ASHiTA is not designed to recover traditional geo-
metric structures such as room layouts that other prior scene
graph construction approaches do [12, 15, 45], with a spe-
