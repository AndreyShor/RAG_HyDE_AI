A general version of four-arm event for SLE
In this section, we aim to prove Theorem 1.3, which provides up-to-constants estimates for general
versions of interior and boundary four-arm events for SLE, defined as W+
4 (ε, r) and W4(a, ε, r) in
(1.5) and (1.6). We first review in Section 6.1 some related results on SLE arm exponents obtained
in [42]. Then, we deal with the interior case in Section 6.2, and the boundary case in Section 6.3.
6.1
Some results on SLE arm exponents in [42]
We now recall and discuss some related results on SLE arm exponents in [42]. We follow the original
notations and statements in [42], with a few exceptions that we indicate in footnotes. Throughout,
we write ξ2j for the interior 2j-arm exponent, and ξ+
j for the boundary j-arm exponent, given by
(1.2).1
First recall the following boundary arm events defined in [42]. Let η be a chordal SLEκ in H
from 0 to ∞. Fix y ≤−4r < 0 < ε ≤x. Let bτ0 = bσ0 = 0. For j ≥1, let bτj be the first time after
bσj−1 that η hits the connected component of ∂Bε(x) \ η([0, bσj−1]) that contains x + ε, and let bσj
be the first time after bτj that η hits the connected component of ∂Br(y) \ η([0, bτj]) that contains
y −r. Define
Hα
2j−1(ε, x, y, r) := {bτj < ∞}.
(6.1)
Let eτ0 = eσ0 = 0. For j ≥1, let eσj be the first time after eτj−1 that η hits the connected component
of ∂Br(y) \ η([0, eσj]) that contains y −r. Let eτj be the first time after eσj that η hits the connected
component of ∂Bε(x) \ η([0, eσj]) containing x + ε. Define
Hα
2j(ε, x, y, r) := {eτj < ∞}.
(6.2)
Note that the definitions of Hα
2j−1(ε, x, y, r) and Hα
2j(ε, x, y, r) are restrictive on the arcs that each
crossing first hits. For instance, the events depicted in Figure 1.3 do not belong to this type of arm
events.
The following result is part of [42, Proposition 3.1].
Proposition 6.1 (Proposition 3.1, [42]). Fix κ ∈(0, 4].2. Suppose r ≥1 ∧(200ε). We have
P[Hα
2j−1(ε, x, y, r)] ≲xξ+
2j−1−ξ+
2jεξ+
2j, provided |y| ≥(40)2j−1r,
(6.3)
P[Hα
2j(ε, x, y, r)] ≲xξ+
2j+1−ξ+
2jεξ+
2j, provided |y| ≥(40)2jr,
(6.4)
P[Hα
2j−1(ε, x, y, r)] ≳xξ+
2j−1−ξ+
2jεξ+
2j, provided x ≍r ≤|y| ≲r,
(6.5)
P[Hα
2j(ε, x, y, r)] ≳xξ+
2j+1−ξ+
2jεξ+
2j, provided r ≤|y| ≲r,
(6.6)
where the constants in ≲and ≳are uniform over x and ε.3
1The definition of the boundary j-arm exponent α+
j in [42] is shifted by one, namely α+
j = ξ+
j+1.
2There is another parameter ρ in [42, Proposition 3.1], which corresponds to a force point v ≥0 of the SLEκ(ρ).
Here we take ρ = 0 and v = x. The statement in [42, Proposition 3.1] was made only for κ ∈(0, 4), but we believe
that the same argument also works for κ = 4 in the case considered here
3This is the statement given in [42, Proposition 3.1]. To be precise, in (6.6), the constant in ≳can be made
uniform over x in a bounded interval (0, c0], but should depend on c0. Similarly, in (6.5), there are implicit constants
c1, c2 involved in the condition x ≍r. The constant in ≳can be made uniform over x in the interval c1r ≤x ≤c2r,
but should at least depend on c1.
