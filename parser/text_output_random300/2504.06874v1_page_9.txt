deviations of near-field signals over two areas selected in regions I and II, respectively. 
We also carefully examine the gate-dependent optical contrast between regions I and II 
by selecting different areas, and it shows a consistent trend (Fig. S8). Same analyses 
are also performed for the SNOM images obtained in the second cycle scan (Fig. S7b 
& Fig. S8) with an extended Vg range. Since after a complete gating loop of the first 
cycle scan (see Fig. S5)), region II changes into a very small area due to DW sliding 
when gated (to be discussed in details in Fig. 3), we instead extract (𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼−𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼) 𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼

where region III and region II have identical polar stacking orders. The result is plotted 
by the black dots in Fig. 2i, with the error bars determined in the same way as described 
above. We can see from Fig. 2i that the two consecutive scan cycles reveal an almost 
identical trend: (i) the optical contrasts for both (𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼−𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼) 𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼

  and (𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼−𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼) 𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼

reverse signs when the carrier type swaps from electrons (positive Vg) to holes (negative 
Vg); (ii) the absolute optical contrast for both curves shows an increased trend with 
increased carrier doping for both electrons and holes. ABCB-type stacking orders are 
predicted to host spontaneous vertical electric polarizations because of the broken 
inversion and mirror symmetries [37, 39-40]. The systematic evolution of gate-
dependent near-field response observed in Figs. 2a-2i suggests the existence of two 
distinct polar stackings hosting opposite vertical electric polarizations. This was not 
observed in previous optical studies of tetralayer graphene [52, 53].  
The presence of two polar stacking orders with opposite vertical electric 
polarizations observed in gate-dependent SNOM is further verified by our KPFM 
results (data shown in Fig. S9), performed after the two consecutive SNOM 
measurements (Fig. 2i) without applying a backgate voltage. Distinct work function 
between two adjacent polar stacking orders, regions I and III, is observed (the area of 
region II vanishes after SNOM scans), in which the measured work function of region 
I is smaller than that of region III. Therefore, region I corresponds to ABAC stacking 
based on our DFT calculations (Fig. 1c & Fig. S1) where the largest charge imbalance 
occurs in between the middle two layers (polarization downward) and the topmost layer
