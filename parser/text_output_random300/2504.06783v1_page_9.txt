Fig.1 | The convergent mean state of global meridional overturning circulations (GMOCs) estimated in two 
coupled reanalyses. a–f, Stream functions (unit: Sv = 106 m3/s) of GMOCs for historical simulations (1950–2022) 
of CESM and CM2 (denoted as CESM-HIS and CM2-HIS), coupled data assimilation (CDA) results (1950–2022) 
with CESM and CM2 models (denoted as CESM-CDA and CM2-CDA), as well as the ocean reanalysis products 
SODA3 (1980–2019) and ORAS5 (1958–2022). g–l, Mean states of potential density distributions in the North 
Atlantic over the domain of 55°–35° W for CESM-HIS (g), CM2-HIS (h), ORAS5 (i), CESM-CDA (j), CM2-CDA 
(k) and observational dataset EN4 (l). The shadings with white contours represent potential density referenced to a 
depth of 1500 m (unit: kg/m3). The black contours represent salinity (unit: PSU). m–n, Potential density (σ) root 
mean square error (RMSE) reduction rate against the observation product WOA18 for CESM-CDA and CM2-CDA 
compared with their respective model simulation as well as reanalysis products.
