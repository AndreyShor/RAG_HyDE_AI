constraints on a derivative coupling geff
aee for various values of geff
aγγ, which are however
taken to be constant. Our results can be compared by taking the constraints in ref. [70] for
geff
aγγ = 0 and comparing them to our tree-level model constraints from figure 9 (“Constant
(P)” for Scenario E). This comparison is shown in figure 15. For low ALP masses, our
constraints are in good agreement with those in ref. [70], but we obtain substantially
stronger bounds for high masses.
It should be noted that ref. [70] does not consider the contributions to ALP production
arising from electron-positron annihilation. Therefore, we also compare our constraints
with those given in ref. [35], based on ref. [45], where this contribution is included. The
original analysis from ref. [45] did not discuss the bounds for large couplings, which were
estimated in ref. [35] assuming the ALPs to be monoenergetic. Clearly, this approximation
is not very accurate and leads to a very different upper bound. However, the shape of
the bound coming from the annihilation of electrons and positrons matches that of ours
relatively well.
The constant shift between the lower bound from ref. [45] and ours may be attributed
to the different implementations of the track length. Indeed, the track length distribution
that we use (see figure 3) is larger for low energies than the one given in figure 14 of ref. [45],
which is based on the (unpublished) EGS shower code. We note that our implementation
agrees very well with the results from ref. [107], which has run GEANT4 simulations for
E137.
Another potential difference between our analysis and the one from ref. [45] is
that the E137 analysis uses a much more sophisticated implementation of the detector
acceptance, tracking the ALP decay products and their interactions with the detector,
which is beyond the scope of our analysis.
As discussed in appendix B.2, our bounds have a discontinuity at ma = √2meEcut ≈
45.2 MeV, because we conservatively neglect the non-resonant production channels. In-
cluding these channels is expected to further improve the agreement with ref. [45], which
finds a continuous bound.
