RealAmplitudes vs QAOA Ansatz (Hamiltonian agnostic vs informed)
QAOA is popularly used for optimisation problems as it is Hamiltonian informed. The form of the
QAOA circuit ansatz is:
|ψ(β, γ)⟩=
p
Y
k=1

e−iβkHM e−iγkHC

|+⟩⊗n
(8)
where, p is the number of layers.
β = (β1, β2, . . . , βp) and γ = (γ1, γ2, . . . , γp) are variational
parameters. HC is the problem Hamiltonian, which encodes the cost function of the optimisation
problem and makes it Hamiltonian informed.
HM is the mixer Hamiltonian, typically chosen as
HM = Pn
i=1 Xi, where Xi is the Pauli-X operator acting on the i-th qubit. |+⟩⊗n is the initial state,
which is an equal superposition of all computational basis states [105].
When comparing different ansatz in our hyperparameter search we found that the RealAmplitudes
ansatz returned higher values of Ps (results in Figure 8e). The simple explanation for this is that the
RealAmplitudes ansatz has more parameters and is therefore more expressive allowing it to find a state
with good overlap with the ground state. But what happens if we increase the depth of QAOA so that
it has the same number of parameters as the RealAmplitudes ansatz? At p = 2, for the 18 variable
problem size, QAOA has just 4 independent parameters, but already has a depth of 58 gates, whereas
the RealAmplitudes depth is 20 gates (these are the abstract circuits before transpilation). This is due
to the fact that our problem Hamiltonian HC, is fully connected. Consequently, the QAOA circuit has
full connectivity (a fully connected entanglement arrangement), implementation of which on the IBM
QPU is possible only with the introduction of SWAP gates. Running and simulating these QAOA
circuits at p = 2 can already take a long amount of time which makes increasing p quite infeasible.
However, Ref. [106] shows QAOA can have good performance at p = 12 on a fully connected SK-
problem. This is possible due to the concentration of parameters found with QAOA, where parameters
at smaller problem sizes can be extrapolated to larger problem sizes. The power of QAOA is that it
can perform well with a relatively small number of parameters at low depth which should allow scaling
to larger problem sizes. Future work could further explore the practical implementation of QAOA,
using concentration of parameters to scale to large, dense QUBOs.
