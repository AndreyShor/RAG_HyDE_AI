• If we assume A is Hermitian and negative semi-definite, we can apply Lemma III.4 and Lemma A.7 to
obtain a quite tight bound on the terms within the max{·} operator. We have

• If A is an arbitrary matrix, but we choose m = ⌈∥AT∥2⌉such that ∥Ah∥2 ≤1, we can apply

Appendix B: Definition and Lemmas for block-encoding
Definition B.1 (block-encoding). Given an n-qubit matrix A ∈CN×N with N = 2n, if we can find α, ϵ ∈R+,
and an (m + n)-qubit unitary matrix UA such that
∥A −α (⟨0m| ⊗IN) UA (|0m⟩⊗IN)∥2 ≤ϵ,
then UA is called an (α, m, ϵ)-block-encoding of A. In particular, if the block-encoding is exact, i.e., ϵ = 0,
then UA is referred to as an (α, m)-block-encoding of A.
Lemma B.2. Suppose A ∈CN1×N1 , and B ∈CN2×N2, where UA is an (α1, m1)-block-encoding of A and UB
is an (α2, m2)-block-encoding of B. Then, the tensor product UA ⊗UB is an (α1α2, m1 + m2)-block-encoding
of A ⊗B.
