Materials and Methods
The following section details the methods employed in this study, covering sample preparation, op-
tical microscopy for crack monitoring, and synchrotron XRD and XRF experiments at PETRA III,
DESY.
2.1
Sample preparation
The specimens were prepared from high-strength martensitic spring steel SAE 9254 (DIN/EN:
54SiCr6). The steel was austenitized under vacuum at 1080◦C for 100 minutes, quenched with
nitrogen, and tempered at 400◦C for 1 hour in argon to form a martensitic structure. Following
heat treatment, three samples were machined from 12 mm diameter wire rods via electric discharge
machining, featuring a gauge section of 10 mm length, 5 mm width, and 2 mm thickness to pro-
mote surface crack initiation. Two specimens were shot-peened (Guagliano, 2001) with an Almen
intensity of 0.16 mm using a pneumatic system equipped with dual nozzles, operated at 1.5 bar
pressure, and steel shots with a diameter of 0.4 mm (700 HV, G3 per VDFI 8001). This ensured
full surface coverage and introducing compressive residual stresses estimated at 900 MPa (Wildeis
et al., 2021; Wildeis et al., 2022). The third specimen remained unpeened.
To study crack behavior, cracks were initiated by applying uniaxial cyclic loading at a stress ratio
of R = −1 (i.e., the ratio of minimum to maximum stress), a frequency of 10 Hz, and stress
amplitudes varied between 550 MPa and 680 MPa, corresponding to high cycle fatigue conditions.
Slip bands formed at prior austenite grain boundaries, acting as crack initiation sites, with shot-
peened specimens showing delayed crack growth due to residual stresses (Wildeis et al., 2021;
Wildeis et al., 2022).
2.2
Optical microscopy
Optical microscopy was used to track crack initiation and early propagation across the specimens.
Surface preparation involved progressive grinding with SiC paper up to grit 4000, followed by a
final polish with a colloidal silicon suspension of 0.25 µm grain size to yield a smooth, reflective
finish. A confocal laser microscope (Olympus LEXT OLS4000) was employed to acquire detailed
images of the specimen surfaces at scheduled intervals during fatigue testing. These images allowed
for the measurement of crack lengths and the evaluation of crack density, offering insights into the
progression of fatigue damage across both treated and untreated conditions (Wildeis et al., 2021;
Wildeis et al., 2022).

Synchrotron-radiation experiment
The synchrotron-radiation experiment was conducted at the P06 beamline of PETRA III at DESY,
Hamburg (Falkenberg et al., 2020). A sketch of the utilized setup is shown in Fig. 2(a), which was
also described in (Chakrabarti et al., 2022). A monochromatic x-ray beam of 35 keV was selected
