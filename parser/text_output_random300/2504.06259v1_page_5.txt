the sign of δ is opposite for the red and blue drives, if
Ωeff can be made equal for the two transitions during the
MS gate, these contributions cancel, as is the case for a
continuous-wave laser [32].

FIG. 4: Raman transitions and frequency combs to
generate MS(θ). In a), the level structure for the
MS(θ) Raman transitions. |n⟩is the initial phonon
number in a particular motional mode, and red- and
blue-sideband transitions are |n −1⟩and |n + 1⟩
respectively. The Raman transitions operate through
virtual states to address the qubit motional modes. The
grey arrow is the global beam ωg acting as one leg of
the transition, while the individual beams complete the
transition as symmetric red-(blue-) detuned transitions
ωr (ωb). As the qubits never occupy the virtual
intermediate states, the population oscillates between
|00⟩and |11⟩. b) A graphical representation of the three
frequency combs involved in the MS(θ) gate. frep
indicates the repetition rate of the laser, δAOM/2π
represents the median frequency shift of the red and
blue combs relative to the global comb. These are then
shifted further from δAOM/2π by ±δc/2π (not denoted
here). To generate the necessary transitions to drive the
gate near ω|1⟩−|0⟩/2π, tooth j of the global comb and
teeth j + 105 of the red and blue combs combine. Comb
tooth separation of 105 is represented by a smaller
number of comb teeth in the figure for graphical
purposes.
However, in our implementation of the MS gate,
we split a mode locked laser (repetition rate frep =
120.125 MHz, and pulse duration τpulse = 3.9 ps) into
two paths, the global and IA paths. Using AOMs, differ-
ent frequency shifts are produced on each of the paths.
To drive the MS gate, we need two separate Raman tran-
sitions as shown in Fig 4a. The frequency on global beam
ωg is shared between these transitions. To complete the
gate, red- and blue- detuned sidebands are needed, and
these tones ωb and ωr are both applied to the IA AOM.
By definition, a pulsed laser is also a frequency comb,
thus each of those tones has a corresponding comb offset
from each other, shown in Fig 4b [12]. The angular fre-
quencies of the j-th comb tooth of each comb are offset
from one another,

in which δAOM/2π ≈30 MHz is the difference between
the singular frequency applied to the global beam AOM
and the median frequency applied to the IA beam AOM.
We can define ω(j)
g
in terms of the frequency comb:
ω(j)
g
= ωSP + ∆+ j2πfrep,
(11)
where ωSP /2π is the 2S1/2 |F = 1, mF = 0⟩−2 P1/2
|F = 0, mF = 0⟩transition frequency, and ∆is the single-
photon detuning of tooth zero of comb g from this tran-
sition.
To drive the MS gate, our Raman transition
needs to have a frequency difference of approximately
ω|1⟩−|0⟩/2π ≈12.643 GHz.
This is realized with comb
teeth separated by 105 harmonics (105 × 120.125 MHz
≈12.613 GHz) plus the additional shift δAOM ± δc.
To be precise, the the jth tooth of comb g combines
with the j + 105th teeth of combs r and b to primarily
drive the blue and red motional sidebands of the two-
photon Raman transition between qubit states, respec-
tively. As described below, these frequency combs cre-
ate a significant contribution to the fourth-order light
shift [31], which we need to account for in our calibra-
tion routine.
We describe the resonant 2S1/2 −2 P1/2 Rabi rate of
the jth tooth of each frequency comb α = g, b, r by a
hyperbolic secant envelope [33],

sition generated from tooth j of comb α and tooth j + l
of comb β is,
