where for the light-to-light element the underscore h denotes that at least one heavy fermion
line is present in the corresponding diagram. At LO only the diagonal element are present,

Polarized matching follows the same structure, with all the 2-loop [105] and 3-loop light
initiated contributions known.
Zero-Mass VFNS.
The simplest VFNS construction is the Zero-Mass VFNS (ZM-VFNS): quarks
are assumed decoupled below their respective threshold and light above. The scheme resums
