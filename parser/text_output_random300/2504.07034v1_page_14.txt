Thus, sending M →∞in (3.47), we obtain
Z
Γint ρ|X|2 (v · ν) dl = 0.
Since ρ ∈[C−1
0 , C0] by assumption (ii) and v · ν ≤0 on Γint
i , for i = 2, · · · , N2, from Definition
3.1(vii), we obtain
Z
Γint
1
ρ|X|2 (v · ν) dl ≥0.
This is a contradiction since ρ ∈[C−1
0 , C0], v · ν ≤−C−1 on Γint
1
by Definition 3.1(vii), and ω
(and thus X) is continuous and not identically zero on Γint
1
by Lemma 3.5.
This completes the proof of Theorem 3.2.

4. Applications to Transonic Shock problems
In this section, we employ the general framework of Definition 3.1 and the main theorem, The-
orem 3.2, established in §3 to analyze the low regularity of entropy solutions of several transonic
shock problems including the regular shock reflection problem, the Prandtl reflection problem,
the Lighthill diffraction problem, and the Riemann problem with four-shock interactions.
First of all, in verifying the conditions of Definition 3.1, condition (viii) is often difficult to be
verified directly. The following lemma is useful for that; in fact, it is used in all the applications
we describe below.
Lemma 4.1. Let (ρ, v) be a solution of a Riemann problem which satisfies conditions (i)–(vii)
of Definition 3.1 and assumption (i) of Theorem 3.2. Assume that
(a) Γint
1
= ∂Ω∩∂Λj for some j ∈{1, · · · , M}, where Λj are defined in Definition 3.1(i).
(b) Γint
1
is not a segment of straight line. In particular, denoting by P1 and P2 the endpoints of
Γint
1 , there exists a point P ∗∈Γint
1
\ {P1} such that τ(P1) ̸= ±τ(P ∗), where τ(·) is a unit
tangent vector to Γint
1
at a point.
(c) (v · τ)(P1) ̸= 0.
Then condition (viii) of Definition 3.1 is satisfied.
Proof. By re-indexing sets Λj, we can assume that Γint
1
= ∂Ω∩∂Λ1. Then (ρ1, v1) is the uniform
state in Λ1, where ρ1 is constant and v1 = (u(1)
1 , u(1)
2 ) −ξ with a constant state (u(1)
1 , u(1)
2 ). This
state is called state (1).
We show the existence of a point ˆP in the relative interior of Γint
1
such that the curvature of
Γint
1
is non-zero at ˆP and (v · τ)( ˆP) ̸= 0. Denote by S the line tangential to Γint
1
at P1.
Denote by Q the intersection point of line S and line L through center O1 = (u(1)
1 , u(1)
2 ) of
state (1) perpendicular to S. Note that, for any point P, v1 = O1 −P so that (v1 · τ S)(Q) = 0
and (v1 · τ S)(P) ̸= 0 for all P ∈S \ Q, where we recall that v1 is the pseudo-velocity of the
uniform state in Λ1 which also defines v1 on the whole R2.
Denote by ˆQ the point on S such that Γint
1
coincides with S between points P1 and ˆQ, but not
on any larger interval extended through ˆQ. Note that it is possible that ˆQ = P1, but ˆQ ̸= P ∗
since the tangential line to Γint
1
at P ∗is not parallel to L by our condition (b).
If ˆQ ̸= Q, then (v · τ)( ˆQ) = (v1 · τ)( ˆQ) ̸= 0, where v is the velocity on Γint
1
from the Ω–side
and we have used (2.10). Also, from the definition of ˆQ, in any neighborhood of ˆQ, there exists
a point P ∈Γint
1
with nonzero curvature. Thus, it follows from the C2–regularity of Γint
1
in its
relative interior (by condition (v) of Definition 3.1) and the continuity of v in Ωnear and up
to Γint
1
(by assumption (i) of Theorem 3.2) that there exists a point ˆP ∈(Γint
1 )0 with non-zero
curvature and (v · τ)( ˆP) ̸= 0.
Therefore, the remaining possibility is that ˆQ = Q. Note that (v1 · τ S)(Q) = 0. Moreover,
using condition (c), the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, and the regularity of Γint
1
and of (ρ, v)
