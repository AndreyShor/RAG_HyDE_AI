Figure 1 shows the variation normalised propagation vector 
p
kc , which represents 
energy or power transmission direction and magnitude with 
p
 (transmissibility of wave in 
plasma). As the wave's angular frequency increases, the magnitude of the propagation vector 
decreases, indicating an inverse proportionality between dispersion and frequency. This implies 
that lower angular frequencies correspond to higher photon energies, which leads to increased 
plasma interaction and faster energy loss as wave energy rises. This trend is evident in both 
quantum plasma as well as in the absence of quantum effects 

, though the latter shows a 
53% lower magnitude of this effect. This discrepancy arises due to the substantial Fermi pressure 
in quantum plasma compared to the thermal pressure, leading to an increased number of 
accessible energy levels and a higher state density in the plasma. Consequently, the plasma's 
ability to transmit waves is constrained, resulting in a noticeable reduction in angular frequency 
as the propagation vector grows.

H  Across all three cases, a similar trend is observed. As the quantum parameter 
decreases, the value of the propagation vector increases by 33.3% in the first case and 23% in the 
next case. This phenomenon arises due to the interaction between degeneracy pressure and the 
quantum Bohm potential. As a result, we can conclude that wave transmission becomes 
constrained by the influence of the quantum Bohm potential, which incorporates quantum 
tunneling effects.
