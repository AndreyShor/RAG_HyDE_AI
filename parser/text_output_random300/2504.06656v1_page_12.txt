Under (AUC) the Curve with cuts and without cuts valuestable.1 demonstrates that MLP and
BDT are the best classiﬁers overall; they improved after applying cuts and provided the biggest
area under the curve.
To improve the performance of the BDT, we used 800 trees with a node splitting threshold of
2.5%. The maximum tree depth is set to 3. The optimal cut value for a node’s variable is determined
by comparing the sum of the indices of the two daughter nodes, which are trained using Adaptive
Boost with a learning rate of β = 0.5 for the parent node. The Gini Index is used as the separation
index. The variable range is divided into 20 equally sized cells. In Figure 6BDT signal signiﬁcance
without applying cuts (a) and with applying cuts (b), respectivelyﬁgure.6, the signal signiﬁcance
of the BDT classiﬁer increases as we apply cuts, as shown in Table IIThe signal signiﬁcance for
the classiﬁers of signal and background with applied cuts and without applied cuts at Lint =
3000 fb−1table.2, for signal events with an integrated luminosity of Lint = 3000 fb−1. BDT has an
optimal cut −0.0048 when cuts are applied, which shows that signal purity is higher corresponding
to the signiﬁcance 12.7414.
