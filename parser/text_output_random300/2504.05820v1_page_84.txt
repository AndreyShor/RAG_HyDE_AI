study [244], in which the global fit provided only very loose constraints on the charm PDF,
which was then determined mostly by the EMC data. Indeed, a DIS-only fit, for which most
data were already available at the time of the previous determination, determines charm with
very large uncertainties. On the other hand, both the central value and uncertainty found in the
collider-only fit are quite similar to the baseline result. This shows that the dominant constraint
is now coming from collider, and specifically hadron collider data. Among these, LHCb data
(which are taken at large rapidity and thus impact PDFs at large and small x) are especially
important, as demonstrated by the increase in uncertainty when they are removed.
In all these determinations, the charm PDF at x â‰ƒ0.4 remains consistently nonzero and positive,
thus emphasizing the stability of our results.
Dependence on the parametrization basis.
Among the various methodological choices,
a possibly critical one is the choice of fitting basis functions.
Specifically, in our default
analysis, the output of the neural network does not provide the individual quark flavor and
anti-flavor PDFs, but rather linear combinations corresponding to the so-called evolution basis
(cf. Section 1.3.2). Our charm PDF is given in Eq. (3.1) as the linear combination of the two
