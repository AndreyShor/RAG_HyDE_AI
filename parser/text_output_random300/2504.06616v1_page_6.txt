Type IL GRB by the observation properties of prompt
emission.
4.2.1. Belonging to Type I GRB
Traditionally, the Amati relation mostly contains
Type II GRBs, while Type I GRBs were regarded as out-
liers of the correlation. Type I GRBs are found to form
a class distinct from Type II GRBs. Therefore, the Am-
ati relation is widely used to classify Type I GRB and
Type II GRB because of its significant distinction be-
tween the two types of GRBs. Based on the correlation,
some studies integrated Ep,i and Eiso from the Amati re-
lation into a single parameter, considering the duration,
thus proposing a new classification method (Minaev &
Pozanenko 2020; L¨u et al. 2010).
Here we adopt the parameter ε = Eγ,iso,52/E5/3
p,z,2
from L¨u et al. (2010), and plot the Amati relation
and logε - logT90,z diagram (Fig. 5a,b). It shows that
both GRBs with determined redshift, GRB 230307A
and GRB 211211A, fall in Type I GRB region, while
the three GRBs without redshift measurements, GRB
200914A, GRB 200311A and GRB 170228A fall largely
in Type I GRB region as the redshift varies. This clearly
indicates that the five Type IL GRBs all belong to Type
I GRBs in terms of spectral and energetic characteris-
tics.
Since Type I GRBs are more likely to occur in high
magnetic environments, the Epeak of Type I GRBs is rel-
atively higher than that of Type II GRBs. We measured
Epeak of five Type IL GRBs using Pyxspec software
(Gordon & Arnaud 2021) and found that their Epeak
is closer to that of Type I GRBs compared to Type II
GRBs (see Table 2) .
Spectral lag, a parameter that characterizes temporal-
spectral property, was also used to classify GRBs
(Gehrels et al. 2006). Type I GRBs normally have negli-
gible spectral lags, whereas larger positive spectral lags
are characteristic of Type II GRBs. We calculate the
spectral lag for these Type IL GRBs following treat-
ments in Ukwatta et al. (2012) and find that the spectral
lag of these Type IL GRBs are consistent with Type I
GRBs.
In addition to their spectral properties, the time vari-
ability properties can also help distinguish Type I GRBs
from Type II GRBs. Since the emission region of Type
I GRBs is smaller than that of Type II GRBs, Type I
GRBs exhibit a smaller minimum variability timescale
(MVT) (Golkhou et al. 2015). We calculated the MVT
of Type IL GRBs using Bayesian blocks and found that
they also fall within a region closer to that of Type I
GRBs rather than Type II GRBs.
In summary, we confirmed that the four GRBs iden-
tified using the criterion, as well as GRB 230307A, all
belong to Type I GRBs based on their spectral and time
variability properties of the prompt emission.
After demonstrating that all five GRBs belong to
Type I GRB, we look back at the position of their dura-
tions in the GRB sample. We obtain all GRBs from the
Fermi GBM Burst Catalog and fit their durations and
fluence with a double-log-Gaussian function (Fig. 5f). If
the distribution of long and short bursts is considered
to be continuous rather than truncated at 2 s, then the
durations of the five Type IL GRBs are basically on the
3σ edge of the short burst distribution. According to
the short burst sample, the expected number of Type I
GRBs with a duration greater than 3σ of the distribu-
tion is about 0.8 in the last decade, that is, the number
of Type IL GRBs we found is significantly larger than
the expected number.
4.2.2. Forming a distinct subclass
After confirming that these five GRBs belong to Type
I GRBs, we now demonstrate that they form a distinct
subclass. We found that in samples summarized in pre-
vious studies, the precursors and quiescent periods for
Type II GRBs are generally longer, while those for Type
I GRBs are relatively short (Wang et al. 2020). For the
five Type IL GRBs, they all locate in the same region to
form a separate cluster of GRB with a short precursor
and short quiescent period but long duration, making
themselves a distinct class in T90-Twt distribution map
(Fig. 6c).
4.2.3. Different from typical “long-short” GRB
Since GRB 060614, GRBs with similar characteristics
and properties (including GRB 211227A) have been re-
ferred to as “long” short bursts. However, we would like
