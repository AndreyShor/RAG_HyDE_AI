Fig.3 | Composited GMOC with its physical modes in CESM model simulation and coupled reanalysis. a–c, 
The first principal component (PC1) derived from empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition of GMOC 
over the area north of 30° N (denoted as MOCn) and 5–30-yr filtered time series of normalized North Atlantic Deep 
Water (NADW) for CESM-HIS (a), CESM-CDA (b), and ORAS5 (c). d–f, Same as a–c, but for PC1 of GMOC 
over the area of 30° S–30° N (denoted as MOCt) and 6-month–20-yr filtered kinetic energy dissipation rate (εm). g–
i, Same as a–c, but for PC1 of GMOC over the area south of 65° S (denoted as MOCs) and the 1–20-yr filtered 
Antarctic Circumpolar Current residual circulation (ACC-RC). j–l, Time series of the 24-month running mean 
GMOC index and linear combination of ACC-RC, εm, and NADW with coefficients α, β, and γ, respectively. The 
parameters α, β, and γ are the linear regression coefficients between the GMOC indices and ACC-RC, εm, NADW 
indices, respectively, as [α1, β1, γ1] = [0.64, −0.05, 0.24], [α2, β2, γ2] = [0.46, 0.12, 0.07], and [α3, β3, γ3] = [0.31, 
−0.01, 0.08].
