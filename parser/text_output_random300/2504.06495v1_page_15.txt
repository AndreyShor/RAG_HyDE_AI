⟨ψ0|ψ0⟩. While φt(b) depends on this initial value φ0, we leave this dependence implicit in
our notation. As explained in Subsection 2.1, in the absence of truncation, the total squared
norm is preserved over time, that is, φt−1(b1, . . . , bt−1) = PK
k=1 φt(b1, . . . , bt−1, k). In our basic
model, we consider K-way branching with ﬁxed ratios δk ∈(0, 1) for k = 1, . . . , K where
PK
k=1 δk = 1. Thus, in the absence of truncation, our branching process would be given by
φt(b) = δbt φt−1(b1, . . . , bt−1),
(5)
for all t ∈{1, . . . , T} and b ∈{1, . . . , K}t. To introduce truncation into this model, we
incorporate time-dependent threshold values ξt ∈(0, ∞). Our basic branching model with
truncation is then deﬁned as:
φt(b) =





δbt φt−1(b1, . . . , bt−1)
if δbt φt−1(b1, . . . , bt−1) ≥ξt ,
0
otherwise.

This formulation implements small-signal truncation by eliminating branches whose squared
amplitude falls below the threshold ξt at time t. When a branch’s squared amplitude becomes
zero (φt(b) = 0), the corresponding state vector vanishes (ψt(b) = 0), which we interpret as
the termination of that branch of the process. Through the threshold ξt, this model modiﬁes
the standard Schr¨odinger evolution by terminating branches whose squared amplitude falls
below the threshold. For the basic model, we choose the threshold ξt to be exogenously
determined as
ξt = ǫ αt,
(7)
where α ∈(0, 1) and ǫ > 0 are ﬁxed parameters. To motivate this functional form, consider
how φt(b) would evolve in the absence of any threshold (as in equation (5)). Obviously, φt(b)
would decay exponentially with t, with decay rate determined by the sequence of branching
ratios δbt along the path b. Therefore, any positive threshold not decaying exponentially
would eventually truncate all paths.
The exponentially decaying threshold ξt guarantees
