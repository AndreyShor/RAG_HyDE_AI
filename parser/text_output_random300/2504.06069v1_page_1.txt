Abstract: A physics-constrained neural network is presented for predicting the optical response of 
metasurfaces. Our approach incorporates physical laws directly into the neural network architecture 
and loss function, addressing critical challenges in the modeling of metasurfaces. Unlike methods that 
require specialized weighting strategies or separate architectural branches to handle different data 
regimes and phase wrapping discontinuities, this unified approach effectively addresses phase 
discontinuities, energy conservation constraints, and complex gap-dependent behavior. We 
implement sine-cosine phase representation with Euclidean normalization as a non-trainable layer 
within the network, enabling the model to account for the periodic nature of phase while enforcing 
the mathematical constraint 𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝜑+ 𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝜑= 1. A Euclidean distance-based loss function in the 
sine-cosine space ensures a physically meaningful error metric while preventing discontinuity issues. 
The model achieves good, consistent performance with small, imbalanced datasets of 580 and 1075 
data points, compared to several thousand typically required by alternative approaches. This physics-
informed approach preserves physical interpretability while reducing reliance on large datasets and 
could be extended to other photonic structures by incorporating additional physical constraints 
tailored to specific applications. 
 
1. Introduction 
The interaction of light with matter at the nanoscale is a high interest research direction due to a 
diverse range of potential applications from photodetection [1], and optical imaging [2], to 
telecommunication [3] and quantum technology [4,5]. Among nanophotonic structures, metasurfaces 
consisting of arrays of nanoantennas have attracted great interest for their ability to control light-
