by high-latitude effects, while the flux in the X-ray
energy range is explained by the spin-down radiation
of the magnetar (Sun et al. 2025).
GRB 170228A,
GRB 200914A and GRB 200311A do not comply with
the high-latitude effects in the gamma-ray energy range
(Fig. 9b), thus requiring additional components to ex-
plain the extended emission. Considering the prolonged
emission, and the fact that the occurrence rate of Type
IL GRB within Type I GRB (about 5/400) is compara-
ble to the proportion of magnetars among neutron stars
(∼1%) (Kaspi & Beloborodov 2017), it is reasonable to
consider the magnetar as the central engine.
If the accretion-powered engine is considered, the du-
ration of main emission could by defined as(Zhang 2025):
TGRB ≃max(tff, tacc) −tbo,

where tff is free-fall timescale of the progenitor star,

, where ρ is the density of progeni-

The tacc is the characteristic

2 are the disc’s radius,
disk thickness and Keplerian rotation rate, respectively.
The H/R0 is taken as 0.2 within the neutrino cooled disc
accreting at
˙M ≃0.1 ∼1M⊙s−1 (Chen & Beloborodov
2007). The tbo is the timescale for the jet to break out
the envelope of the progenitor, which is usually taken as
∼1s for a compact binary merger remnant.
In this scenario, as one can see, the characteristic
timescale for accretion is relatively small, so we need
to consider the duration of main emission from the per-
spective of progenitor. The involvement of progenitor
system with a white dwarf (WD) seems to be reason-
able, as the density of a WD is smaller than that of a NS,
resulting in a longer free-fall timescale, which is compa-
rable to the long duration of the main emission. This
is similar to the explanation for GRB 211211A (Yang
et al. 2022).
In the binary merger system involving WD, Chen et al.
(2024) proposed that during the coalescence process, the
repeated partial disruptions (RPDs) of the WD would
take place by the NS (or the BH). This process would
likely modulate the luminosity variation of an accretion
driven jet, resulting in light curves exhibiting weak pe-
riodicity, known as quasi periodic modulation (QPM).
Moreover, GRB 230307A and GRB 211211A did exhibit
relatively weak periodic activity in the main emission
phase (Chen et al. 2024).
We perform the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (Lomb
1976; VanderPlas 2018) to search for this periodicity
in the remaining three Type IL GRBs.
It turns out
that during the main emission of GRB 170228A and
GRB 200311A, the weak periodicity shows in the light
curve, with the period about 2.1 s and 2.2 s, respectively
(Fig. 10). The weak periodicity lasts for about 11 s for
GRB 170228A and 17 s for GRB 200311A, correspond-
ing to the ∼5 cycles and ∼8 cycles, respectively. Sub-
stituting the period we obtain in Equation (3) and using
Equation (1) in Chen et al. (2024), the mass of the WD
is estimated to be M∗∼1.4M⊙for GRB 170228A, and
GRB 200311A (taking e ≃0 ). The resulting WD mass
is very close to the Chandrasekhar limit, which is con-
sistent with the statements made in Yang et al. (2022).
This result further validates the scenario that the pro-
genitor is the compact binary merger involving a WD,
and the merger product (central engine) is a magnetar.
It is worth noting that there could be another situ-
ation in which the duration of GRB can be explained
in terms of the emitter rather than the progenitor or
