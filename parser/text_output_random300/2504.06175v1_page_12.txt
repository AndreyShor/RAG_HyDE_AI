of success is improving average Bell fidelity over several
pairs or removing coherent errors in a single pair, we find
the simplest distillation protocols can provide broad im-
provements (see discussions in Sec. IV A and Sec. IV B).
However, for using distilled Bell pairs in modular com-
puting it is valuable to consider a stricter metric: distill
(physically) non-local Bell pair with higher fidelity than
what can be obtained using other available means. This
work leaves open the question of broadly improving upon
this metric. One way to obtain such improvements using
the protocols discussed here would be to make noise more
uniform on the Bell pairs; another would be to lower the
measurement errors on the qubits; while a third would
be to go beyond the types of protocols discussed in this
work.
In our analysis, we found it particularly useful to view
distillation as stabilizer checks. This made it ‘easy’ to
view different distillation protocols as tools to catch dif-
ferent types of errors (which need not be Pauli errors, and
are not necessarily modeled as such here either). This can
help guide the selection of distillation protocols depend-
ing on the source of the dominant noise in one’s error
model.
A variety of prior work focusses on the optimal trade-
offs between success probability and Bell fidelity upon
distillation over Pauli noise channels. For practical stud-
ies, our work motivates the study of T1/T2 noise chan-
nels (these have experimentally available noise param-
eters) and benchmarking protocols when starting with
unequal bell pairs that incur measurement errors.
