or modified retrospectively to ensure proper behaviour).
In this work, we propose an alternative perspective on
CBF synthesis. In particular, we argue that the synthesis
of CBFs should begin with the design of their gradients.
By constructing CBFs from their gradients, we can directly
mitigate issues such as varying relative degrees. Since CBFs
inherently involve boundary conditions that are meant to
capture the geometry of the safe set, the problem of CBF
synthesis naturally leads to solving boundary value problems.
Solving such problems is non-trivial, especially for generic
control-affine systems; to address this, we leverage physics-
informed neural networks (PINNs) [11], [12] as a tool for
solving the associated boundary value problems through
supervised learning. This overall approach enables us to
mitigate the varying relative degree issue without relying on
retrospective modifications or conservative safe set approx-
imations (Fig. 1). As compared to existing CBF synthesis
methods such as sum-of-squares (SOS) approaches [13],
learning-based methods [14]–[16], and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)
reachability-based techniques [17], [18], our approach specif-
ically focuses on addressing the varying relative degree issue
through gradient-based design.
Our contributions are as follows:
1) We introduce a new perspective on addressing the
varying relative degree issue by treating the problem
of CBF synthesis as solving boundary value problems.
2) We propose a PINN-based method that allows us to syn-
thesize CBFs that are free from inactivity issues without
relying on retrospective modifications or conservative
approximations.
3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
both simulation and real-time quadrotor experiments.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
We consider the control architecture shown in Fig. 2 and
systems with continuous-time control affine dynamics:
˙x = f(x) + g(x)u,
(1)
where x ∈X ⊂Rn is the state of the system with X denoting
the set of admissible states, u ∈Rm is the input of the
system, and f : Rn 7→Rn and g : Rn 7→Rn×m are locally
Lipschitz continuous functions.
Given an uncertified policy π(x), our goal is to design a
safety filter to safeguard the system—ensuring that the state
of the system remains within a given safe set C ⊆X. The
safe set C is assumed to be compact and is parameterized
as the zero-superlevel set of a continuously differentiable
function h : X 7→R:
C = {x ∈X | h(x) ≥0}.
The boundary of the safe set is ∂C = {x ∈X | h(x) = 0}
with ∇h(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈∂C, and the interior of the safe
set is Int(C) = {x ∈X | h(x) > 0}.

III. BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide the background on CBF-
based safety filters to facilitate our discussion. We begin by
introducing our notations and necessary definitions.
We denote the Euclidean norm as ∥·∥. A set of consecutive
integers is denoted by Z[a,b], where a and b are positive
integers with a ≤b. The notations Int(·) and Conv(·)
correspond to the interior and the convex hull of a set,
respectively. The Lie derivative of a function h along a vector
field f is written as Lfh, and ∇represents the gradient
operator. The symbol ◦denotes function composition.
Definition 1 (Forward Invariant Set): Consider a system
with dynamics ˙x = f(x) with f : X 7→X being a Lipschitz
continuous function. A set C ⊆X is a forward invariant set
for the system if x(0) ∈C implies x(t) ∈C for all t ∈T+
x0,
where T+
x0 is the maximum time interval of existence for the
state trajectory initialized at x(0) = x0.
Definition 2 (Extended Class-K Function): A continuous
function γ : R 7→R is an extended class-K function, denoted
by Ke, if it is strictly increasing and passes through the
origin (i.e., γ(0) = 0).
Definition 3 (Relative Degree [4]): Let h : X 7→R be a
ρth-order differentiable function. A system with dynamics (1)
and output equation y = h(x) is said to have a relative degree
of ρ if ρ is the smallest integer between 1 and n such that
LgLρ−1
f
h(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈X.
In this work, we consider systems with dynamics as spec-
ified in (1) and say that a ρth-order differentiable function,
h(x), has a relative degree of ρ if the system with (1) and
output equation y = h(x) has a relative degree of ρ.
Definition 4 (CBF [4]): Let C ⊆X be the zero-superlevel
set of a continuously differentiable function h : X →R with
∂C = {x ∈X | h(x) = 0} and ∇xh(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈∂C.
The function h is a CBF for (1) if there exists a function
γ ∈Ke such that the following condition is satisfied:
max
u∈Rm [Lfh(x) + Lgh(x)u] ≥−γ(h(x)),
∀x ∈X.
Based on Def. 4, we can define a set of certified inputs
for every x ∈X:
Ucbf(x) = {u ∈Rm | ˙h(x, u) ≥−γ(h(x))},
where ˙h(x, u) = Lfh(x) + Lgh(x)u.
As discussed in [4], CBFs can be used to verify the for-
ward invariance of a safe set under the closed-loop dynamics
of a system.
