performance. This metric indicates how much of the variance in true phase values can be explained 
by our model.  
The model demonstrates consistent performance across both dataset sizes, with a slight improvement 
in performance metrics and a reduction in standard deviations when using the larger dataset. It 
indicates that the physics-constrained approach maintains robust performance even with the smaller 
Dataset B. These results show the effectiveness of the physics-constrained neural network despite the 
small dataset sizes and the challenging behavior of phase. The model's strong performance with 
limited data is especially beneficial for metasurface design, where generating training samples via full 
electromagnetic simulations is both computationally time-consuming and expensive.

Figure IV shows the prediction capabilities of the model from two perspectives: relationship between 
gap size and phase response, and direct correlation between the true and predicted values of phase. 
The relationship between gap size and phase response is shown in Figure IV-a, that illustrates how the 
model captures this relationship across different gap sizes. The scatter plot shows that the physics-
constrained network is capable to capture the complex, non-linear relationship between gap size and 
phase values across entire range. Figure IV-b provides a direct comparison between the true and 
predicted values of phase using color scale indicating prediction error in sine/cosine space. There is a 
strong diagonal alignment along the perfect-prediction line (red dashed line) visually confirms a high 
value for the metric R2. An interesting example of the model’s handling of phase wrapping is observed 
at the point highlighted by black arrow, where the true phase is 0 radian, while the prediction is near 
2π. Despite the large numerical difference between these values, the color indicates a low error, as 
the sine/cosine representation recognizes them as physically close states. This is a powerful example 
demonstrating the advantage of the physics-informed approach in handling the circular nature of 
phase values.
