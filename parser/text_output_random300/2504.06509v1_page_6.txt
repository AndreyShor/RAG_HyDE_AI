VCMA and VCEC induced effective magnetic field 
 
Fig 2(a) shows normalized electrical minor loops of the 500 nm device under different voltages. 
Before measurement, a large magnetic field was applied to saturate magnetization in the 
positive direction, ensuring that in the AP state, only the free layer's magnetization is reversed. 
A constant current was used for resistance measurements, and the average voltage between AP 
and P states was recorded. Under an applied voltage, two effects are observed: VCMA and 
VCEC. The VCMA effect alters anisotropy, manifesting as changes in coercivity. A positive 
voltage increases anisotropy, leading to a wider loop, consistent with prior VCMA studies, 
where electron depletion enhances the free layer anisotropy24,25. On the other hand, VCEC 
shifts the minor loop center due to modulation of the exchange coupling field. The loop shifts 
left or right, depending on voltage polarity. Loop center field and coercivity measurements, 
averaged over three trials per voltage, exhibit linear voltage dependence (Fig. 2(b-c)). The 
extracted VCEC and VCMA strengths are -1.39 ± 0.36 mT and -7.29 ± 0.43 mT, respectively. 
 
FIG. 2 | VCEC and VCMA induced effective magnetic field.  (a) Normalized minor loops of a 500 nm 
MTJ under different applied voltages. A positive (negative) voltage reduces (increases) the loop width due to 
VCMA and shifts the loop leftward (rightward) due to VCEC. (b) Loop center field and (c) coercivity of the 
minor loops as functions of the applied voltage. Three loops per voltage are collected to minimize errors. 
VCEC and VCMA are extracted from the slopes of the linear fits. (d) Extracted VCEC strength in MTJ pillars 
of different diameters. Error bars represent uncertainties from the linear fitting process.
