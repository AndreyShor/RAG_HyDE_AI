increases, the Fermi pressure also increases, which resists further compression of the electron 
and positron clouds acting as a repulsive force that counteracts the potential. 
 
Figure 6 is a 3D representation of soliton profile in quantum plasma with the variation of 
electrostatic potential (ϕ) and the stretched coordinates ξ and τ. A contour of the 3D structure is 
also mentioned describing the stability of soliton’s peak for approximately 2 seconds and soliton 
structure for approximately 10 seconds, in the presence of coriolis force and gravitational effects. 
The red colour shows the stability of peak of soliton and the blue, green and yellow colours are 
representing the width of soliton and the orange colour shows starting and ending phase of 
soliton structure. 
5. Summary and discussion 
 
The dynamics of uniform astrophysical magnetised quantum plasma consisting of 
electrons, ions, and positrons have been studied with the investigation of ion-acoustic solitary 
waves and finally the soliton solution has been obtained. The Separated Spin Evolution Quantum 
Hydrodynamic (SSE-QHD) model is introduced as the analytical framework, incorporating 
quantum diffraction, quantum statistical effects and separated spin-up and spin-down effects for 
fermions. The dispersion relation for coupled ion, electron, and positron modes considering 
various quantum effects and environmental influences has been established. The solitary wave 
structures due to ion acoustic wave and its solution by the use of KdV method have been 
investigated. Through theoretical formulation and graphical analysis, the paper aims to provide a 
better understanding of quantum plasma dynamics. 
 
Plasma wave transmission exhibits an inverse correlation with the magnitude of the 
normalized propagation vector, indicating decreased transmission efficiency as vector magnitude
