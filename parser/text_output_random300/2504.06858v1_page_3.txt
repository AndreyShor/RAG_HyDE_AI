in [13], [6], [10]. Further development of estimates of complex eigenvalues for
Schr¨odinger operators were obtained in [11], [21], [5], [15], [25] and many oth-
ers.
It turns out that the inequality (1.3) can be generalised to the non-selfadjoint case.
Let R+ = [0, ∞) and R−= (−∞, 0]. Denote by
(1.4)
Ω= {ω ∈C : Re ω ∈[0, π); Im ω ∈R}
and
(1.5)
Ω± = {ω ∈C : Re ω ∈[0, π); Im ω ∈R±}
Then the mapping ω 7→λ(ω) = −2 cos(ω) transfers Ωto C \ [2, ∞) and Ω±
to C± \ [2, ∞), where C± = {z ∈C : Im z ∈R±}.
Our main result is the following.
Theorem 1.1. Let V ∈L1(R) be a complex-valued potential. Then the eigenval-
ues λ ∈C \ [2, ∞) of the operator WV(b) satisfy the inequality

|V(x)| dx,
where λ = −2 cos(ω) and where ω ∈Ω.
The constant in this inequality is sharp in the sense that there are potentials V
such that inequality (1.6) becomes an equality.
The study of different aspects of the spectrum of functional difference operators
WV(b) was considered before. In the case when −V = V0 = e2πbx is an expo-
nential function, the operator WV(b) first appeared in the study of the quantum
Liouville model on the lattice [9] and plays an important role in the representa-
tion theory of the non-compact quantum group SLq(2, R). The spectral analysis
of this operator was studied in [28]. In the case when −V = 2 cosh(2πbx) the
spectrum of WV(b) is discrete and converges to +∞. Its Weyl asymptotics were
obtained in [23]. This result was extended to a class of growing potentials in
[24]. More information on spectral properties of functional difference operators
can be found in papers [16], [17], [19], [20], [27].
2. RESONANCE STATE
We begin by proving that in the self-adjoint case the spectral point 2 is the reso-
nance state for the operator (1.1).
