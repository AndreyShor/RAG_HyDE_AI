The equations can be written in real form as
Im(Acc −Abb) = Im(Ac −Ab)
Im(Abb −Add) = Im(Ab −Ad)
Im(Add −Acc) = Im(Ad −Ac)
Im(Aaa −Acc) = Im(Aa −Ac)
Im(Add −Aaa) = Im(Ad −Aa)
Im(Abb −Aaa) = Im(Ab −Aa) .
One observes that only three of them are independent, which leads to
Im(Abb −Aaa) = Im(Ab −Aa) ,
Im(Acc −Aaa) = Im(Ac −Aa) ,
Im(Add −Aaa) = Im(Ad −Aa) ,
and
ωb −ωa = 2 Im(Ab −Aa) ,
ωc −ωa = 2 Im(Ac −Aa) ,
ωd −ωa = 2 Im(Ad −Aa) .
Combining these finally provide the third condition
ωa −2 Im(Aa) = ωb −2 Im(Ab) = ωc −2 Im(Ac) = ωd −2 Im(Ad) .
Altogether, the three conditions are necessary and sufficient to have K[cabcd](z) = 0 and the proof of the theorem is
complete.
Remark S13. It may be surprising to observe that the natural frequencies do not have to be identical when nontrivial
phase lags are present. Yet, as shown in subsection III E, the third condition in fact guarantees that the oscillators
whose positions on the unit circle participate in a conserved cross-ratio have the same effective frequency. Note that
in terms of the original parameters, the third condition is equivalent to
ωa −σWkaa sin αkaa = ωb −σWkbb sin αkbb = ωc −σWkcc sin αkcc = ωd −σWkdd sin αkdd ,
where kj takes any value within {a, b, c, d} \ {j} for j ∈{a, b, c, d}.
Remark S14. Note that there is no restriction on the outgoing edges from the vertices involved in conserved cross-
ratios to the vertices not involved in a conserved cross-ratio. This means that, although the conditions of the theorem
make the equations for each oscillator of the cross-ratio identical, their contribution within the whole network can be
very different.

Basic examples for Theorem 2
One of the simplest, but instructive, example with a conserved cross-ratio is the following.
Example S15. Consider a graph of N = 5 vertices with complex weight matrix

where ω and ω1 are fixed to arbitrary real values while
ωj = ω1 + 2 Im(Aj −A1) ,
j ∈{2, 3, 4} .
By construction, the effective natural frequency of oscillators 2, 3, 4 is Ω= ω1−2 Im(A1). In fact, one can readily verify
that this yields identical equations for oscillators 1,2,3,4 (although they have different contributions to oscillator 5):
˙zj = ρ(z) + iΩzj −ρ(z)z2
j where j ∈{1, 2, 3, 4} and ρ(z) = PN
k=1 Akzk. In such a case, from Thm. S12 and Lem. S6,
there is only one functionally independent cross-ratio, say
c1234(z) = (z3 −z1)(z4 −z2)
(z3 −z2)(z4 −z1) ,
that is conserved.
