Here, 𝐼𝑆𝑛2+ and 𝐼𝑆𝑛0 are the measured signal contributions and 𝑁𝑆𝑛𝑂 and 𝑁𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒 are the atomic number densities of 
Sn2+ in the oxide and Sn0 in the metal, respectively. 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒 and 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑂 are the effective attenuation lengths (EAL) in the 
oxide and in the metal, 𝜃 is the emission angle, 𝑑 is the oxide layer thickness. 
Eq. 2/S2 was first published in Ref. [3]:

Here, the EALs 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒 and 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑂 were averaged (𝐿𝑎𝑣) and the resulting depth distribution function 𝜑𝑎𝑣(𝑧) was 
convoluted with an decreasing and an increasing error function for the oxide and the metal, respectively. Eq. 3/S3 is 
the revised version of eq. 2/S2, for which 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑂 and 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒 are considered as distanced quantities again:

Figure S3. Schematic illustrations of the integrals of the depth distribution functions 𝜑(𝑧), which were solved to derive 
eq. 1-3/S1-S3. 𝜑𝑆𝑛𝑂(𝑧) is the integrand of the numerator and 𝜑𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒(𝑧) the integrand of the denominator of the respective 
equation. 
 
5. XPS Peak Fitting 
Peak fitting of the XPS data was performed in CasaXPS version 2.3.22PR1.0. All metallic component peaks (denoted by 
superscript 0) have been fitted using different asymmetric peak functions (Table S2) as determined from the sputter-
cleaned metallic reference. All other component peaks, such as oxides (denoted by superscript 2+) and satellite peaks, 
have been fitted using symmetric Voigt functions, which is a convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian. The intensity 
ratios of all spin-orbit split peak doublets, both oxide and metal, were fixed to 1:2 for p-orbitals and 2:3 for d-orbitals.
