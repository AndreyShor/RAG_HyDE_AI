W function [111]

which has two real branches W0 and W−1 for real x.
Since the Hamiltonian (93) is exact for arbitrary values of m and p to inﬁnite order in
κ, the whole structure of the theory can be studied, from the weak ﬁeld to the strong ﬁeld
limits. As in the test particle case, a phase space trajectory in (r, p) space can be obtained
by setting H = H0. Alternatively, the equations of motion (82)–(85) yield

vanishes, corresponding to W(x) = −1.
This is the transit point between two branches W0 and W−1 and are a consequence of t
being a coordinate time.
This problem can be dealt with by describing the trajectories in terms of the proper
time τa of each particle. Using (89), this is

which remarkably have an exact solution.
This is procured as follows. Noting that H is constant, (99) is an ordinary differential
equation that can be solved for p(τ). The trajectory r(τ) can then be obtained by solving
(77) or by directly solving (100) after substituting the solution for p, yielding an exact
expression for the proper separation of the two bodies as a function of their mutual proper
time. The result is [108]
