Steady-state behaviour for pω = 0.015 comparing the null and evade & spread (E&S) strategies. (a, b) Snapshots
from the steady state for the null and E&S cases respectively. (c, d) The normalised same-species correlation functions cX,X(r)
and the normalised cross-species correlation functions cX,Y (r), coloured data are for E&S, black for null. (e) The fraction of

bination of the clustering and the exclusion constraint
but it is also affected by predation.
For example, the
fact that the non-symmetric case has less predation of B
by A means that cA,B is less negative at short distances,
compared with symmetric case. The non-symmetric case
also has cB,C less negative at intermediate distances (for
example, r ≈10), indicating a change in the arrange-
ment of the patches of different species. See Sec. VI B for
further discussion of this effect.
A complementary measure of clustering is obtained
by choosing a random circular area in the system and
counting the number of each species within that “probe”
area [97–100] We take circles of radius r0 = 5, compa-
rable with the cluster size inferred from the two point
correlations. Results for individual species are shown in
Fig. 12(e). From the tail of the histogram, we observe an
increased probability of having no C particles at all, and
a decrease in the number of large clusters of the C species
(we attribute this to the reduced C density.) Fig. 12(f)
shows the distribution of the total number of particles
in the probe area. In the non-symmetric case, there is
a significant increase in the probability to have very few
particles in the probe area, which we again attribute to
the reduced C density, which promotes larger fluctua-
tions. (For example, C is more likely to die out locally,
causing their prey A to proliferate, until such time as
predators arrive some elsewhere and control them.)
Overall, we find mild differences between symmetric
and non-symmetric cases, as one may expect because
particles’ interactions still have random directions, even
if one species behaves differently from the others. In the
following we discuss some effects of directional strategies.
B.
Evade and Spread strategy (sparse case)
We consider the sparse case (pω = 0.015) in which the
Evade and Spread strategy leads to the largest popula-
tion of A particles (recall Fig. 7). The results of this sec-
tion have L = 120, consistent with Sec. IV. The relevant
demographic analysis and spatial structures are charac-
terised in Fig. 13. The parameters are those of Tab. III,
note in particular that (σA, λA) have the same values as
the non-symmetric strategy of Secs. VI A 1 and VI A 2,
but the E&S strategy means that particles also have sig-
nificant directional preferences.
We compare in Fig. 13(a,b) the behaviour of the Evade
and Spread (E&S) strategy with the symmetric (null)
case. As well as the more numerous A particles in the
E&S case, one also sees in Fig. 13(b) that A particles
tend to be more spread out inside their domains, due to
spreading.
Fig. 13(c) shows that the predation count of A par-
ticles is significantly reduced by E&S. This is expected
because of the reduced σA, but the effect is much stronger
than Fig. 11, presumably because the spreading strategy
causes A particles to move away from their prey species
B. Fig. 13(d) shows that the lifetime of A particles is
enhanced. Again, this is a stronger version of the effect
shown in Fig. 11, which we attribute to A evading their
