Abstract
Due to their superior fatigue strength, martensitic steels are the material of choice
for high cyclic loading applications such as coil springs. However, crack propagation
is influenced by residual stresses and their interaction is poorly understood. In fact,
Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics predicts un-physical singularities in the strain around
the crack tip. In this study, we have combined synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction, x-
ray fluorescence, and optical microscopy to map the factual strain fields around crack
tips with micrometer spatial resolution. X-ray fluorescence and optical images were co-
registered to locate the crack in the x-ray diffraction maps. Observed crystal recovery
close to cracks confirmed that the diffraction signal originates at least in parts from
the cracks. The retrieved local strain field around the crack was further improved by
averaging information over carefully selected diffraction peaks. This procedure provided
strain maps around crack tips with a spatial resolution of about 1 µm and enabled a
prediction of further crack growth.

Introduction
Martensitic steel is widely used in engineering applications due to its high strength, high wear re-
sistance (Wu et al., 2023), and favorable fatigue properties (Heshmati et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2020;
Zhou et al., 2024). The transformation from austenite to martensite occurs through a diffusionless
process (Shewmon, 1969; Kelly, 2012), resulting in a highly distorted lattice structure that enhances
