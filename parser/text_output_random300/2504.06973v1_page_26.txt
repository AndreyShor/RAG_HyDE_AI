Notes. Columns list the model index, initial stellar masses and periods, mass accretion efficiency, masses and periods during the stripped star
phase. The first set of models is computed with varying primary star masses. For the second set of models with indices 3a - 3d, Md,initial is fixed to
5.5 M⊙.
Fig. E.1: Estimating rotational and macroturbulent line broad-
ening of the stripped star. Comparison between the disentangled
spectrum (grey) and a PoWR model atmosphere around the Si III
4552 Å line for the narrow-lined stripped star. Shaded regions
indicate estimated uncertainties, calculated as the standard devi-
ation of the flux residuals between the observed spectra and the
disentangled spectrum. The model spectra were calculated with
different values for rotation and macroturbulent velocities that
are given in the legend.
tial mass, a higher overshooting efficiency results in a larger con-
vective core on the main sequence and in turn a larger He core.
Semi-convective mixing is modelled with semi-convective coef-
ficient αSC = 10, following Schootemeijer et al. (2019); Klencki
et al. (2020). We include thermohaline mixing (Kippenhahn et al.
1980) with the standard thermohaline coefficient αTH = 1 but we
do not expect thermohaline mixing to have a significant impact
on the stellar structure of the stripped stars (e.g., Götberg et al.
2018).
Binary interaction and mass transfer during Roche-lobe
overflow are handled using the implicit mass transfer approach
proposed by Kolb & Ritter (1990). The parameters α, β, δ and
γ as described in Tauris & van den Heuvel (2006) control the
efficiency of mass transfer. We initially ran our simulations at
a coarser resolution and then tested numerical convergence by
Fig. E.2: Estimating rotational broadening of the broad-lined Be
star. The disentangled spectrum of the broad-lined companion
star around the He I 4026 Å line is shown in grey. Shaded re-
gions indicate estimated uncertainties, calculated as the standard
deviation of the flux residuals between the observed spectra and
the disentangled spectrum. Over-plotted are simulated spectra
from the Tlusty library with Teff = 17 kK and log g = 4.0. The
model spectra have been broadened using a fixed macroturbulent
velocity of 50 km/s and differing rotation velocities; the best fit
value of vrot,Be = 270 ± 70 km/s and ±2 −σ uncertainties.
increasing the mesh and time resolution for the final models, en-
suring that the results remained qualitatively consistent.
The MESA EOS is a blend of the EOSs OPAL (Rogers &
Nayfonov 2002), SCVH (Saumon et al. 1995), FreeEOS (Ir-
win 2004), HELM (Timmes & Swesty 2000), PC (Potekhin &
Chabrier 2010), and Skye (Jermyn et al. 2021).
Radiative opacities are primarily from OPAL (Iglesias &
Rogers 1993, 1996), with low-temperature data from Fergu-
son et al. (2005) and the high-temperature, Compton-scattering-
dominated regime from Poutanen (2017). The electron conduc-
tion opacities are from Cassisi et al. (2007) and Blouin et al.
(2020).
Nuclear reaction rates are from JINA REACLIB (Cyburt
et al. 2010), NACRE (Angulo et al. 1999), and additional tab-
ulated weak reaction rates Fuller et al. (1985); Oda et al. (1994);
