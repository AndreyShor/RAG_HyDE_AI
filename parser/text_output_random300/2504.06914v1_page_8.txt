Appendix A: Dimensionless equations
To perform numerical simulations, we use the dimen-
sionless equations by applying the following substitu-
tions: ri →˜ri = ri/σ, t →˜t = t/τu = tµϵ/σ2, the
dimensionless activity Λ = v0τu/σ = v0σ/µϵ, the dimen-
sionless translational diffusivity Dt →˜Dt = Dtτu/σ2 =
Dt/µϵ, ∇i →˜∇i = σ∇i, U(rij) →˜U = U/ϵ, ˜µ =
µϵτu/σ2 = 1 and the dimensionless rotational diffusiv-
ity ˜Dr = Drσ2/µϵ.
By using these substitutions, one
obtains the dimensionless form of the equations
d˜ri(˜t) = Λ ˆni(˜t)d˜t −˜∇i

We perform numerical simulations with ˜Dr = 3, ˜Dt =
1 for thermal, and ˜Dt = 0 for athermal cases.
Appendix B: Scaling ansatz for X at different
system sizes
In Fig. 2 of the main text, we showed the scaling be-
havior ⟨∆X⟩∼Λ2 for a system of size N = 4096. To ver-
ify the robustness of this scaling, we present additional
data for a larger system size (N = 16384) at density
ρσ2 = 1.1 in Fig. 9. We confirm that the quadratic scal-
ing ⟨∆X⟩∼Λ2 remains valid for both thermal ( ˜Dt = 1)
and athermal ( ˜Dt = 0) cases, consistently across system
sizes.

As in Fig. 2, we plot ⟨∆X⟩for two system sizes
(N = 4096, 16384) at density ρσ2 = 1.1, demonstrating that
the scaling ⟨∆X⟩∼Λ2 holds for both the thermal ( ˜Dt = 1)
and athermal ( ˜Dt = 0) cases at the larger system size.
Figure 10. (a) Shear stress, σtot
xy , vs. shear strain, Exy = γ,
at Λ = 7 for 24 ensembles without significant non-linearity
or hysteresis. Different colors represent individual ensembles,
with the black line showing the linear fit, where the slope
gives the shear modulus, ⟨G⟩= 105.7 ± 0.679 in units of ϵ/σ2.
(b) Linear response trajectories and (c) non-linear response
trajectories exhibiting significant hysteresis and nonlinearity.
Non-linear trajectories are excluded from shear modulus cal-
culation. Raw data are shown as semi-transparent circular
markers, with opaque square markers representing averages
over 100 consecutive values of γ and σtot
xy . Markers are color-
coded by shear direction: forward shear 0 →γm in red, back-
ward shear γm →−γm in green, and −γm →0 in blue. (d)
Fraction of linear ensembles, nlin/ntot, as a function of activ-
ity Λ.
