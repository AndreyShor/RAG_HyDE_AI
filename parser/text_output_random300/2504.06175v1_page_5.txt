error m we notice a decrease in r. On the other hand,
if we fix the measurement error m, increasing the gate
error g has two effects. First, it decreases the initial Bell
fidelity Fb at q = 0 (i.e., the plot begins at a smaller Fb
value) and also decreases the initial r value corresponding
to that initial Bell fidelity. Second, it shrinks the interval
of Fb values over which r > 1.
In the second plot, Fig 4b, the two Bell pairs have
unequal Bell fidelity, i.e., Λp in Fig. 3a is noisy with p ̸= 0.
After the action of this noisy identity gate, the first Bell
pair (across qubits 0 and 1) becomes more noisy than
the second (across qubits 2 and 3) and Bell fidelity of the
first Bell pair F1 is 2.5% lower than that of the second,
F2. Salient features of the plot in Fig. 4b resemble those
of Fig. 4a discussed above. The key difference is that for
fixed g and m values the value of r in Fig. 4b are smaller
than the corresponding values in Fig. 4a.
In fact, we
only see improvement in a small region where the gate
and measurement errors are ≤1%.
In Fig. 4c and 4d we focus on smaller gate and measure-
ment errors, g = 1 × 10−2 or 5 × 10−3 and m = 5 × 10−2
or 1 × 10−2. Here the Y axis is the percentage decrease
in error, i.e.,
ϵd = Fa −Fb
1 −Fb
× 100,
(16)
while the X axis is the initial Bell fidelity Fb. We ob-
tain points along these axis by varying the waiting error
q in Λq. Here, the initial Bell fidelity is typically greater
than 0.9 and we notice a 10% −20% decrease in error
by performing distillation on Bell pairs with equal Bell
fidelity (see Fig. 4c). When the Bell pairs have unequal
Bell fidelity, recurrence does not necessarily decrease the
error for very high Bell fidelity but manages to decreases
error as the initial Bell fidelities become smaller (see
Fig. 4d). This observation is consistent with results in
Fig. 2a which show that the range of initial Bell fideli-
ties where distillation improves is narrow when the initial
Bell fidelities are high.
2.
Three Bell Distillation
Next, we simulate the ZX3B protocol using the circuit
in Fig. 3b. This circuit prepares three Bell pairs, which
we label as AA, BB, and CC, initialized on qubits 0−1,
2 −3, and 4 −5, respectively.
Next, the circuit adds
noise to Bell states AA and CC via Λp. After the first
barrier (labelled t0) a sequence of CNOT gates re-order
the Bell pairs into ABCABC, such that one half of each
Bell pair is separated from its other half by two qubits.
