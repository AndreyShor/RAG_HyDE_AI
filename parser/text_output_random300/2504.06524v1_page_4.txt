an example, when W = 64a ∼20.21ξ ∼34.6 nm and
λa = ta = 5∆a ∼810 meV˚A, the resulting induced gap
is Eg = 0.044∆∼1.3 meV, which remains suﬃciently
large for experimental observation. Moreover, compati-
ble or even stronger SOCs, reaching several eV˚A, have
been theoretically predicted in various 2D systems with
a PST (see, for example, Refs. [68, 69]). Thus, while a
more microscopic evaluation of Eg remains an important
future task, these results suggest that topological phases
protected by the induced gap of ABSs could be experi-
mentally accessible.
Eﬀective theory. To obtain an intuitive understanding
of the numerical results, we derive a low-energy eﬀective
Hamiltonian.
For this purpose, we consider the BdG
equation in the continuum limit:
Hs(kx, y)ψs(kx, y) = Eψs(kx, y),

derivation for Eq (11) is provided in the SM. Notably,
the total number of zero-energy band crossings coincides
with the number of propagating channels, Nc = 2nc [see
Fig. 3(a)]. To proceed with our analysis, we treat the
SOC, Hλ
