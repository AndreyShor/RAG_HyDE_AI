Simulation Parameters:
The model includes three key parameters: 𝐼1J, 𝐼2J and 𝑇𝑠. For Fig. 2C-
2D, we used 𝐼1J = 58 pT, 𝐼2J = 106 pT and 𝑇𝑠= 28s. For Fig. 2E-2F, these parameters were
𝐼1J = 66 pT, 𝐼2J = 124 pT and 𝑇𝑠= 32 s. Note the difference between the two parameter sets arise
because the samples were prepared on different days.
The Intrinsic Magnetic Gain of Samples
To calculate the intrinsic magnetic gain of the system, 𝐺int, we update the master equation to include
the interaction between the sample and and a weak magnetic field applied via the piercing solenoid.
Consider the applied field with magnetic field intensity 𝐻(𝑡) that oscillates at frequency 𝑓. The
updated master equation for the system is
𝑑
𝑑𝑡ˆ𝜌(𝑡) = −𝑖[ ˆ𝐻0 + ˆ𝑉(𝑡), ˆ𝜌(𝑡)] + ˆˆ𝑅ˆ𝜌(𝑡) + ˆ𝑃,
(S11)
with
ˆ𝑉(𝑡) = −𝜇0𝐻(𝑡) · (𝛾15N ˆ𝑆y + 𝛾1H ˆ𝐾y).
(S12)
At the dynamic steady state, the magnetization 𝑀(𝑡) of the sample oscillates at the same frequency
𝑓as the applied field 𝐻(𝑡). This magnetization generates a detectable magnetic flux at the OPM.
When the applied field amplitude is sufficiently small (i.e., when the perturbation from the applied
field is weak compared to the system’s relaxation rate), the ratio between the amplitudes of the
measured magnetic flux (at the sensor) and the applied magnetic flux becomes independent of the
applied field amplitude. Instead, it depends solely on the frequency 𝑓.
We define the internal magnetic amplification 𝐺int( 𝑓) as this frequency-dependent ratio, ex-
pressed mathematically as
𝐺int( 𝑓) = 𝑟3
3𝑑3 · |𝑀(𝑡)|
|𝐻(𝑡)| = 𝑟3
3𝑑3 |𝜒( 𝑓)|,
(S13)
where 𝑟is the radius of the sample and 𝑑is the distance between the sensor and sample, |𝜒( 𝑓)| is
a frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility.
Simulation shows maximal internal gains at 𝑓= 𝐽and 𝑓= 2𝐽, with internal gains 𝐺int(𝐽) ≈
13.8 % and 𝐺int(2𝐽) ≈17.2 %, respectively (Fig. S2).
