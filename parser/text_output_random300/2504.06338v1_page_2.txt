from the density matrices of the final state. Thereby, we
derive and present local approximations (locally constant
field (LCFA) and locally monochromatic (LMA)) of the
density matrix that can be employed in numerical simula-
tions and benchmark these approximations against direct
evaluation of full QED result in a plane wave pulse back-
ground. We consider mono-energetic photons as well as a
two-stage scenario where photons are produced via non-
linear Compton scattering before colliding with a second
laser pulse to create pairs.
The paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2, the the-
oretical model is presented and information on the local
approximation is given. In Sec. 3 the numerical results
for the mono-energetic (Sec 3.1) and the two-stage set-
up (Sec 3.2) are presented and discussed. The paper is
concluded in Sec. 4. Appendix A gives technical details
of the spin quantisation used, and Appendix B gives fur-
ther details about calculation of the spectrum from the
Compton photon source.

THEORETICAL MODEL
In the NBW process, a photon in the initial state is
converted to an electron and a positron in the final state.
We represent this with state vectors:
|in⟩= |γ; ℓ, ε⟩;
|out⟩=
 [e
−; p, σ] , [e
+; q, ς]
E
,
where a photon with momentum ℓand polarisation ε is
converted to a spin-entangled two-particle state compris-
ing an electron with momentum p and spin state σ and a
positron with momentum q and spin state ς as depicted
in Fig. 1. The in and out states are related via the scat-

|out⟩= ˆS |in⟩.
To investigate the spin entanglement between the elec-
tron and positron, we formulate the spin correlation den-
sity matrix, ρb = |out⟩⟨out| by tracing out their momen-
tum states:

so that Tr(ρb) = 1. The 4 × 4 density matrix ρb con-
tains the full information of the paired particles’ spin
states.
By partially tracing over the spin freedom of
the positron (electron), the spin density matrix of elec-
tron (positron) can be acquired as ρ−= Trς(ρb,σ,ς;σ′,ς)
(ρ+ = Trσ(ρb,σ,ς;σ,ς′)) [63].
It is a principle feature of
entanglement that the full denstiy matrix ρb cannot in
general be factorised into a direct product ρ+ ⊗ρ−of
density matrices of each independent particle. Further-
more, we emphasise that the selection of spin quantum
axis is arbitrary and whilst it can change the expression
for the components of the density matrix, it cannot affect
the prediction of any physical results (see the discussion
in Appendix. A).
The degree of the spin entanglement can be assessed by
calculating an entanglement witness; in this work we use
the concurrence, C, for this purpose. The concurrence
can be written [27, 64]:
C = max(0, √e1 −√e2 −√e3 −√e4)

where ej for j ∈{1, 2, 3, 4} are the eigenvalues, ranked in
order of decreasing magnitude, of the auxiliary matrix
R = ρb (σ2 ⊗σ2) ρ∗
b (σ2 ⊗σ2) ,
(4)
with ρ∗
b a matrix having entries equal to the complex
conjugate of the corresponding entries in ρb and σ2 is the
second Pauli matrix. The concurrence satisfies 0 ≤C ≤
1: if C = 1, the quantum state is maximally entangled; if
C = 0 the state is not entangled and the density matrix
can be factorised.

Polarised NBW in pulsed plane waves
The NBW process forms a scientific aim of upcom-
ing experiments that collide high energy photons with a
high power laser pulse such as the LUXE experiment [51].
Because the typical energies of photons available in such
set-ups are ∼O(GeV) and the frequency of laser pho-
tons ∼O(eV), the centre-of-mass energy of a collision
