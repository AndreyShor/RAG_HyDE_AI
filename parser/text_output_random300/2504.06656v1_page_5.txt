MH± = 100 GeV has a value of 5.50894711 × 10−1 and at MH± = 130 GeV it has larger value
4.15123279 × 10−1 but for BR(H+ −→W +h0) at MH± = 130 GeV the value is 2.39630652 × 10−7
much smaller than the leptonic branching ratio. We examined the creation of charged Higgs boson
pairs by photon fusion, their subsequent decays into charged leptons, and the undetected missing
energy transverse (MET) caused by neutrinos. The plots in Figure. 3Branching ratios of three
benchmark pointsﬁgure.3 show that the branching ratio is dominant for the BR(H+ −→τντ). By
the increase in mass of charged Higgs, the BR(H+ −→W +h0) dominants for BP1 at higher mass
of charged Higgs.
The ﬁnal decay products of the charged Higgs bosons in each scenario will be
analyzed. Identifying all potential charged Higgs products is the ﬁrst step in studying the collider
process. The total decay rate per unit time Γ is the sum of all individual decay rates.

Since Γ is the inverse of mass, it is comparable to mass (or energy) in our system of natural units.
At MH± = 100 GeV the decay width of charged Higgs is small, 4.48155347 × 10−4 for BP1, and
