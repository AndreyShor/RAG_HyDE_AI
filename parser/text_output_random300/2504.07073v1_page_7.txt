Fig. 4. Mass-loss rates of stars in the Galaxy (left), LMC (middle), and SMC (right) as a function of the Eddington parameter. The discrete symbols
indicate stars from different spectral classes. The symbols are color-coded according to a star’s current mass. To enable a comparison to different
mass-loss recipes (different rows) that do not have a direct dependence on Γe, we calculated stellar evolution models that predict how Γe changes
during a star’s evolution. Lines indicate how ˙M and Γe change in the stellar evolution models with initial masses of Mini = 15 M⊙(solid line),
30 M⊙(dashed line), 60 M⊙(dash-dotted line), and 90 M⊙(dotted line) using different mass-loss recipes. The models shown here are calculated
until either the surface hydrogen abundance drops below XH < 0.7 (i.e., when the models would interpolate between MS and WR wind) or until a
temperature below T < 12 kK (i.e., when the models would switch to an RSG wind) is reached. Hence, these models should not be compared to
the classical WR stars. The different symbols on the lines mark the zero-age main sequence (squares), the terminal-age main sequence (circles),
and the aforementioned stopping criterion (diamond).
tently up to an order of magnitude higher than the observed val-
ues for stars with comparable properties. Additionally, the pre-
dicted temperature-dependent jumps in mass-loss rates, are not
reflected in the empiric ˙M −Γe plane, indicating that the Vink
et al. (2001) prescription may overestimate these effects or that
the physical assumptions underlying these jumps do not hold
uniformly across the stellar population.
Recently, Björklund et al. (2023) calculated dynamically
consistent stellar atmosphere models providing new theoretical
mass-loss rates for massive OB-type stars. Their models do pre-
dict a temperature dependence, but without jumps in the mass-
loss rates. In the lower panels of Fig. 4, we compare stellar evolu-
tion models incorporating their mass-loss prescription to the em-
piric ˙M −Γe plane. The models generally align well with the em-
piric mass-loss rates across all metallicities. However, the mod-
els exhibit a notable trend: when a star expands and its surface
temperature decreases during the supergiant phase, the predicted
mass-loss rates tend to decline. One exception is seen in the
60 M⊙SMC model at its terminal-age main sequence (TAMS),
where it experiences two sign flips that briefly enhance its mass-
loss rate. If this trend of decreasing mass-loss rate for later evo-
lutionary stages were strictly followed, one would expect a clear
distinction along the ˙M −Γe plane, namely that main-sequence
stars (with log(g/(cm s−2)) ≥3.8)) should cluster in the upper-
left region, while supergiants (log(g/(cm s−2)) < 3.8) should oc-
cupy the lower-right. However, this distinction is not apparent
in any of the three galaxies studied. It is unclear whether this
discrepancy arises from intrinsic scatter and observational un-
certainties or from unresolved physical processes in the theo-
retical models. A deeper investigation, potentially incorporating
more precise observational constraints and refined modeling, is
needed to resolve this question.
4.3.2. Mass-loss rates of He- and WR-stars
To compare different mass-loss recipes for He- and WR-star
winds with observations and our newly derived relation, we cal-
culated models of pure He stars. In Fig. 5, we present how the
He-star models evolve in the ˙M −Γe plane in dependence on
different mass-loss recipes. Note that most of the He- and WR
stars in our sample are not completely free of H at the surface.
Adding H to the surface increases Γe, so from our recipe, these
