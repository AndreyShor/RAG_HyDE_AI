NUMERICAL ERROR ANALYSIS FOR MULTI-QUBIT SYSTEMS
The Berry curvature directly contributes to the friction term and suppresses topological decoherence. For a system
of N qubits, correlated noise introduces cross-talk errors. The total infidelity is bounded by
1 −Ftotal ≤N(1 −Fsingle) +

ρδγ2,
where ρ is the noise correlation strength. Numerical simulations with ρ = 0.1 show that Ftotal > 0.997 for N = 50,
consistent with experimental observations in Rydberg atom arrays.
Assuming Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise ⟨δλ(t)δλ(t′)⟩= σ2e−|t−t′|/τ, the fidelity correction becomes:

.
For a 50-qubit system, Monte Carlo simulations (Fig.
S3) show Ftotal ≥0.997 under σ = 0.01, validating the
scalability of our protocol.
The transient population of the 5P state is bounded by:

as verified by Floquet simulations (Fig. S4). This confirms the effectiveness of nonlinear parameterization in sup-
pressing intermediate-state leakage.
