results, additional experiments were conducted on phantom samples using single-frequency 
reverberant shear waves at 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz, and 2000 Hz. 
 
5. Results and discussion 
5.1 Multi-frequency reverberant elastography simulation 
The angular integral autocorrelation (AIA) [39] method was employed to estimate the SWS 
across various frequencies. Given that the wavelength increases as the frequency decreases, a 
larger autocorrelation window size was used for lower frequencies to ensure that an adequate 
number of waves were included in the autocorrelation calculation. Figure 5 presents the 3D 
SWS maps for different excitation frequencies. The two distinct sides of the simulated medium 
with different SWS are clearly visible in all SWS maps. As the frequency increases, the 
estimated SWS becomes more uniform within each side of the medium. The variation in SWS 
at the boundary between the two materials is attributed to the windowing effect, an inherent 
limitation in this analysis.

Fig. 5. Estimated SWS for the simulated two-sided (soft and hard) medium at different 
excitation frequencies: (a) 500 Hz, (b) 1000 Hz, (c) 1500 Hz, (d) 2000 Hz, and (e) 2500 Hz. 
Figure 6 presents the mean SWS for each side of the simulated medium across different 
excitation frequencies. At all frequencies, the estimated SWS values on both sides closely 
matched the defined values for the model, with an error of less than 4%. The power law 
exponent was estimated to be 0.01 (higher SWS, orange) and 0.04 (lower SWS, blue), 
indicating a nearly dispersionless elastic response in the simulated system.
