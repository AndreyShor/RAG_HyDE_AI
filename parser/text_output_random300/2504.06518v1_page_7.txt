Figure 2: (left panel) LF momentum distribution of the deuteron as a function of cos 𝜃, for different values
of 𝑘. (right pane). Tensor asymmetry as a function of cos 𝜃for different 𝑘. Dashed lines - deuteron with 𝑝𝑛
component only, solid lines - with 𝑃-wave like component included.
As Fig.2 (left panel) shows one may expect measurable angular dependence at 𝑘≳1 GeV/c,
which is consistent with the expectation that non-nucleonic transition in the deuteron takes place at
𝑘≳800 MeV/c.
For tensor polarized deuteron ( Fig.2 (right panel)) we estimated the effect using Eq. (13). As
the figure shows, in this case, the presence of a non-nucleonic component will be visible already at
𝑘≈800 MeV/c, resulting in a qualitative difference in the asymmetry.

Outlook on experimental verification of the predicted effects
The predictions discussed in the previous section which are related to the existence of non-
nucleonic component in the deuteron wave function can be be verified at CM momenta 𝑘≳1 GeV/c.
These seem an incredibly large momenta to be measured in experiment. However, the first such
measurement at high 𝑄2 disintegration of the deuteron has already been performed at Jefferson
Lab[17] reaching 𝑘∼1 GeV/c. It is intriguing that the results of this measurement qualitatively
disagree with predictions based on conventional deuteron wave functions once 𝑘≳800 MeV/c.
Moreover the data seems to indicate the enhancement of momentum distribution as predicted in
our calculations. New measurements will significantly improve the quality of the data allowing
possible verification of the second prediction, that is the existence of angular asymmetry for LF
momentum distribution. What concerns to the tensor asymmetry, it can show a strong sensitivity
the non-nucleonic component in the deuteron influencing also the repulsive character of bound 𝑝𝑛
system at very short distancesde.[18] Currently there are significant efforts being made in measuring
high 𝑄2 deuteron electro-disintegration processes at Jefferson Lab employing polarized deuteron
target[19].
It is worth mentioning that the analysis of exclusive deuteron disintegration experiments will
require a careful account for competing nuclear effects such as final state interactions, (FSI) for
which there has been significant theoretical and experimental progress during the last decade[20–
22]. The advantage of high energy scattering is that the eikonal regime is established which makes
FSI to be strongly isolated in transverse kinematics and be suppressed in near collinear directions.
If the experiments will not find the discussed signatures of non-nucleonic components then they
will set a new limit on the dominance of the 𝑝𝑛component at instantaneous high nuclear densities
