presented in Ref. [706] in the 4FS. Two-loop leading colour planar helicity amplitudes in the
5FS computed in Ref. [707].
The N3LOQCD corrections to b¯b →H are available in the public code n3loxs [473]. The
NNLOQCD corrections have been matched to parton shower using the MiNNLOPS method in
Ref. [708], and the resulting transverse momentum distribution of the Higgs was compared to
NNLOQCD + NNLL results of Ref. [688]. Results for the Higgs transverse momentum spectrum
resummed to N3LL’ and matched to NNLOQCD and approximate N3LOQCD were presented in
Ref. [709]. The perturbative uncertainties are small, opening the possibility of distinguishing
different flavour production modes.
Soft-virtual (SV) and next-to-soft-virtual (NSV) terms,
resummed to N3LL accuracy, were presented in Ref. [710] for the inclusive cross section and
Higgs rapidity distribution.
The authors observe that the improvement in the perturbative
precision when including the SV and NSV terms on top of the N3LOQCD results is quite small,
indicating good convergence of the series.
In b¯bH production, the calculation of Ref. [698], which included both O(y2
b) and O(y2
t )
contributions to NLOQCD in the 4FS, has been matched to PS in Ref. [636]. NNLOQCD results
matched to parton shower were presented in Ref. [711], using the MiNNLOPS framework. The
bottom quarks are treated as massive, with the two-loop amplitudes being evaluated using a
small-mass expansion.
The authors find that the NNLOQCD corrections in the 4FS resolve
tensions between this scheme and the 5FS. Analytic expressions for the two-loop amplitudes for
b¯bH production with massless b quarks are now available for all color structures [712].

An overview of the status of jet final states is given in Table 3.

LH21 status: Differential NNLOQCD corrections available from two independent groups using
the antenna [136,713] and the sector-improved residue subtraction [179] formalisms. Complete
NLO QCD+EW corrections available [714].
NNLOQCD interpolation grids were made available for this process in [715], which facilitate
the inclusion of this process into PDF fits without K-factor approximations. Such grids were
used to perform an αs extraction based on LHC di-jet data in [716]. Based on the NNLOQCD
corrections to massive bottom quark production [218], NNLO+PS predictions were obtained for
B-hadron production at the LHC in [717]. Ref. [718] explored new slicing variables at NLOQCD
for jet processes.
Jet angularities in a resummed and matched calculation were studied in
Ref. [719] that also took into account non-perturbative corrections from the underlying event
and hadronisation.
