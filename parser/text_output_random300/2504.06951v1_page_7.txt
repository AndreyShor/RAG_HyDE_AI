where Tr2N denotes the trace on HN = NN
i=1 C2. The convergence in (3.7) for all possible test functions F
implies that the sequence ( ¯HCW
ΛN )N is a zero-distributed GLT sequence.
Since the spectrum of the normalized Curie-Weiss Hamiltonian ¯HCW
N
is uniformly bounded in N and
contained in a connected compact subset C ⊂R (see also [28, 29] for further details), it suffices to consider
functions F supported on C. By the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, any continuous function F on C can be
uniformly approximated by polynomials restricted to C: in fact this argument is standard and was used
e.g. in [16] in the context of the zero distribution of orthogonal polynomials, when the Jacobi operator is
perturbed by a non self-adjoint compact operator. Moreover, since the (normalized) trace operation is linear
and continuous with respect to uniform convergence of continuous functions on the spectrum, it suffices to
prove (3.7) for all polynomials P restricted to C. Thus, we will establish (3.7) for all such polynomials P,
which by approximation will imply the result for any general F ∈Cc(R) supported on C.
To do so, we stress that the Hamiltonian is homogeneously decomposable [10, Section 2], implying that the
model is block diagonal with the following tracial decomposition
Tr2N [ ¯HCW
N
] = 1

C(J, N)Tr2J+1[ ¯HCW

where, by [18], the quantities

,
are the multiplicities of the (2J +1)-dimensional irreducible unitary representations arising in the decompo-
sition of the N-fold tensor product representation of SU(2) onto C2 with itself. Here, JN = {0, 1, , ..., N/2} if
N/2 is an integer, and equals {1/2, 3/2, ..., N/2} if N/2 is a half-integer. The (2J +1)×(2J +1)-dimensional
matrix ¯HCW

(J) is defined as
¯HCW
