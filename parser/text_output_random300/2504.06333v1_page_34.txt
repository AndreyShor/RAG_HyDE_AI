in terms of the 2-cochain j as
Jγ1,γ2 = j(γ1,γ2)−1ϕπ(γ1γ2).
(6.45)
The commutativity of the diagram (we assume that the associator in Vec(Γ) is
trivial, aγ1,γ2,γ3 = ϕγ1γ2γ3) becomes
α(π(γ1),π(γ2),π(γ3))j(γ2,γ3)−1j(γ1,γ2γ3)−1 = j(γ1,γ2)−1j(γ1γ2,γ3)−1,
(6.46)
which is simply the group cohomology statement that dj = π∗α.

Anomalous Z2 extended to Z4 via quasi-Hopf algebra
6.5.1
Algebraic approach
Algebraically, we can understand the anomaly resolution as follows. The anoma-
lous Z2 is described by the fusion category Vec(Z2,[α]), where [α] ∈H3(Z2,U(1))
encodes the anomaly. As discussed in section 4, to resolve the anomaly, we pick
another fusion category C, which admits a ﬁber functor (hence a special symmetric
Frobenius algebra object), and so is gaugeable, together with a functor
C Ð→Vec(Z2,[α]).
(6.47)
To describe the anomaly resolution, we will describe Vec(Z2,[α]) as the rep-
resentation category of a quasi-Hopf algebra which we denote as H(2), not gauge
equivalent to a Hopf algebra.
The quasi-Hopf algebra H(2) ∶= CZ2
α is an example of the algebras CG
α described
in section 4, with G = Z2 and α a 3-cocycle belonging to the unique nontrivial class
in H3(Z2,U(1)). The bialgebra structure is that of the group algebra C[Z2], and
thus is generated by group-like elements {1,g} such that g2 = 1. We introduce a
nontrivial coassociator
Φ = 1 ⊗1 ⊗1 −2p−⊗p−⊗p−,
(6.48)
where p−= 1
2(1 −g), an antipode S(g) = g, and distinguished elements α = g,
β = 1. Since H(2) is not twist equivalent to a Hopf algebra, the fusion category
Rep(H(2)) does not admit a ﬁber functor. This representation category
Rep(H(2)) ≅Vec(Z2,[α])
(6.49)
is the familiar anomalous fusion category Vec(Z2,[α]) where α is a 3-cocycle rep-
resenting the unique nontrivial cohomology class in H3(Z2,U(1)) = Z2.
We now explicitly describe the anomaly resolution
1 Ð→Z2 Ð→Z4 Ð→Z2 Ð→1,
