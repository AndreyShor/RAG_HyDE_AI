Since ˆHN comprises only even products of operators and does not act on degrees of freedom in orbital N + 1,
Eq. (S.13) simplifies to:
⟨k|k′⟩N+1 ⟨N; r|L
d ˆHN |N, r′⟩R
d = δkk′ ⟨N; r |N; r′⟩L,R
d
EN(r′) = δkk′δrr′EN(r) .
(S.17)
Similarly, in Eq. (S.14) ˆT a
N+1 consists of a number operator acting only on degrees of freedom of orbital N + 1 and
so reduces to,
⟨k|N+1 ˆT a
N+1 |k′⟩N+1 ⟨N; r|N; r′⟩L,R
d
= δkk′δrr′ϵN+1|k| ,
(S.18)
where we used the fact that when using our convention for the index k, the spin-summed occupation number for state
|k⟩N+1 in orbital N + 1 is nk = |k|.
Eqs. (S.15) and (S.16) are more complicated since they connect the part of the chain spanned by ˆHN to the added
orbital N + 1. To make progress we insert the identity,
1N+1 =
X
m,s
|m⟩N+1 |N; s⟩R
d ⟨N; s|L
d ⟨m|N+1 ,
(S.19)
between the creation and annihilation operators of ˆT b
N+1 and ˆT c
N+1 in Eq. (S.10). Then Eq. (S.15) becomes,

⟨N; r|L
d ⟨k|N+1 f †
Nσ |m⟩N+1 |N; s⟩R

(S.22)
where we have defined M σ
k,k′ to denote the matrix element ⟨k|N+1fN+1σ|k′⟩N+1, which is independent of the value of
N. Note also that (M σ
k,k′)† = M σ
k′,k. The factor of (−1)k comes from the fermionic anticommutation when reordering
operators.
Similarly for Eq. (S.16), we obtain,
tN

(S.23)
The nontrivial matrix elements ⟨N; r|L
d f †
Nσ |N; r′⟩R
d and ⟨N; r|L
d fNσ |N; r′⟩R
d must be computed at the previous step
and saved. Note that they are not simple Hermitian conjugates of each other and must be calculated separately.
From these expressions, one may construct the NH Hamiltonian ˆHN+1 at step N + 1 from information obtained at
step N – specifically, the eigenvalues EN(r), and the matrix elements ⟨N; r|L
d f †
Nσ |N; r′⟩R
d and ⟨N; r|L
d fNσ |N; r′⟩R
d .
With Hb
N+1 now constructed, we can diagonalize this matrix to obtain the eigenvalues EN+1 and the left and right
eigenvectors |N + 1; r⟩L(R)
d
. In particular, we can write Hb
N+1 = UR
N+1Hd
N+1(UL
N+1)† where Hd
N+1 is the diagonal
matrix of eigenvalues EN+1 and UR(L)
N+1 is a matrix whose columns are the right(left) eigenvectors. This provides the
set of complex eigenvalues EN+1 needed for the next step.
What about the matrix elements of the fN+1σ and f †
N+1σ operators? These are also needed for the next step. To
compute these, we expand the eigenstates as,
|N + 1; r⟩R(L)
d

U R(L)
N+1 (r; m, s)(†) |N + 1; m; s⟩R(L)

(S.24)
We use this to construct the matrix element,
