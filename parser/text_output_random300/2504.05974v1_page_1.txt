Motivated by the updated HL-LHC projections for Higgs pair production from ATLAS and CMS
and by the release of the FCC-ee Feasibility Study, we critically revisit the sensitivity of the global
SMEFT analysis to deformations of the Higgs self-coupling modifier κ3. To this end, we quantify
the impact of SMEFT operators modifying double Higgs production at the LHC and single Higgs
production, including loop corrections, at the FCC-ee, and include Renormalisation Group Evolution
throughout. We demonstrate that significantly improving on the legacy HL-LHC constraints on κ3
at the FCC-ee is not possible without the √s = 365 GeV run; that individual and marginalised
determinations are similar at the HL-LHC while differing by up to a factor 3 at the FCC-ee; and
that quadratic EFT corrections cannot be neglected.
Overall, the combination of HL-LHC and
FCC-ee data offers unique potential to pin down the Higgs self-coupling with ∼15% precision.
Introduction. The observation of Higgs pair produc-
tion, and the associated constraints on the Higgs self-
interactions, represent a cornerstone of the physics pro-
gram of the HL-LHC [1, 2]. Scrutinising the Higgs tri-
linear coupling is also a core goal of many proposed fu-
ture particle colliders, from the FCC-ee [3, 4] and FCC-
hh [4, 5] to ILC/LCF [6, 7], CEPC [8], CLIC [9, 10], and
the Muon Collider [11, 12].
In the Standard Model (SM), the Higgs trilinear self-
coupling is uniquely determined by the Higgs vacuum ex-
pectation value (v) and its mass (mh). Deviations from
this prediction represent a smoking gun signal of the pres-
ence of new physics beyond the SM (BSM). The precise
determination of the Higgs self-coupling has also pro-
found implications for the vacuum stability of the Uni-
verse [13, 14] and could offer novel insights towards a
solution of the baryon asymmetry puzzle [15–17].
If deviations from the SM are present, the Higgs po-
tential can be parameterised as
V (h) = 1
2m2
hh2 + λSM(1 + δκ3)vh3 + 1
4λSM(1 + δκ4)h4 ,
where λSM = m2
h/2v2. In the SMEFT framework [18],
the leading deviation in the Higgs trilinear coupling stems
from the purely-Higgs dimension-six operator

governed by the Wilson coefficient cφ. Additionally, in
the Warsaw basis, two more operators (cφ□and cφD)
modify the Higgs potential via field redefinitions [19].
Hence in the dimension-six SMEFT, the Higgs trilinear
coupling shifts from its SM value (δκ3 = 0) as

with furthermore δκ4 = δκ3/6.
By means of Eq. (2),
SMEFT results can be translated into constraints on the
Higgs self-coupling via bounds on κ3 = 1 + δκ3.
Constraints on κ3 at the LHC are provided primarily
by Higgs pair production, for which the Run 2 bounds
are −1.2 (−1.2) ≤κ3 ≤7.2 (7.5) for ATLAS (CMS) at
the 95% C.L. [20, 21]. Subleading sensitivity is obtained
through loop corrections to single Higgs processes [22–
25]. At future lepton colliders with √s ≲500 GeV, such
as the FCC-ee, CEPC, LEP3 [26], or the initial stage of
the ILC/LCF, Higgs pair production remains kinemati-
cally inaccessible. However, constraints on κ3 can still
be derived from loop-induced corrections to Zh produc-
tion [27–30]. Above the Zhh production threshold, κ3
could instead be accessed directly.
In the context of the ongoing European Strategy
for Particle Physics Update (ESPPU26), the ATLAS
and CMS collaborations have presented new sensitiv-
ity projections for Higgs pair production at the HL-
LHC [2].
These projections indicate a combined sig-
nificance of 7.6σ for di-Higgs production, correspond-
ing to δκ3 =+29%
−26% at the 68% C.L., hence providing
a substantial improvement in sensitivity compared to
the previous (2019) projections [1, 31] which reported
δκ3 =+50%
−48%.
These bounds are however obtained from
single-parameter analyses and neglect the correlations
