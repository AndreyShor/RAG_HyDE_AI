Since xm,n is an element of D′
m,n ∩Cm,n, we have elements
xm,n,i,j ∈End(Ui ⊗X[a,b] ⊗Uj)
for i ∈Irr(Ca−n,a−1) and j ∈Irr(Cb+1,b+n) such that xm,n is a diagonal representation of the
elements xm,n,i,j, in the sense that we have
xm,n =
X
i,j,α,β
(vα ⊗idX[a,b] ⊗wβ)xm,n,i,j(v∗
α ⊗idX[a,b] ⊗w∗
β),
where uα : Ui →X[a−m,a−1] and wβ : Uj →X[b+1,b+n] are maximal mutally orthogonal families
of isometries.
Now, if we have ia−m = ia and ib+n = ib+1, we can take the distinguished indexes (both
denoted 0) correspoding to the tensor units of the tensor categories Ca−m,a = Ca,a and Cb+1,b+n =
Cb+1,b+1. Let us ﬁrst consider the case where we can ﬁnd strictly increasing sequences (mk)k
and (nk)k satisfying the above. We then set xk = xmk,nk and xk,0 = xmk,nk,0,0. Our goal is to
show that xk,0 becomes close enough to xk for big k.
Put
yk = xk −idX[a−mk,a−1] ⊗xk,0 ⊗idX[b+1,b+nk],
yk,i,j = xmk,nk,i,j −idUi ⊗xk,0 ⊗idUj.
We want to check the convergence ∥yn∥→0. Since for every i and j End(Ui ⊗X[a,b] ⊗Uj)
is a ﬁnite dimensional C∗-algebra, the operator norm and the 2-norm induced by the categor-
ical trace are equivalent. Since the indexing sets Irr(Ca−n,a−1) and Irr(Cb+1,b+n) for i and j
respectively are ﬁnite, it is enough to check the 2-norm convergence
tr(y∗
k,i,jyk,i,j) →0
for all i and j.
Observe that
(6.1)
trX[a−mk,b+nk]((idX[a−mk,a−1] ⊗c ⊗idX[b+1,b+nk])xk) = trX[a,b](cxk,0)
(c ∈End(X[a,b])).
Indeed, consider the ‘one-sided’ conditional expectations
En : A →A[n,∞),
E′
n : A →A(−∞,n]
obtained analogously as E∞
m,n. By the triviality of the center of A[b+1,∞), given c ∈End(X[a,b]),
we have Eb+1(cx) = z1A for the scalar z representing the left hand side of (6.1). This means
that
(trX[a−mk,b] ⊗id)((idX[a−mk,a−1] ⊗c ⊗idUj)xk, ,j) = zidUj
holds for any j, where xk, ,j denotes the diagonal representation of xk,i,j for the diﬀerent i.
Repeating the same argument to the left with E′
a−1(cx), we obtain the claim.
As a consequence of the above observation, it follows that
tr(x∗
k,i,j(idUi ⊗xk,0 ⊗idUj))) = tr((idUi ⊗x∗
k,0 ⊗idUj)xk,i,j) = tr(x∗
k,0xk,0).
This in turn implies
tr(y∗
k,i,jyk,i,j) = tr(x∗
k,i,jxk,i,j) −tr(x∗
k,0xk,0).
For any α and β,
x∗
k,i,jxk,i,j = (u∗
α ⊗idX[a,b] ⊗w∗
β)x∗
kxk(uα ⊗idX[a,b] ⊗wβ).
Deﬁning
δk = ∥x −xk∥, δ′
k = ∥x∗x −(x∗x)k∥,
for (x∗x)k := E∞
mk,nk, we have limk δk = limk δ′
k = 0. By the submultiplicativity of the norm and
the contractivity of E∞
mk,nk, we have ∥x∗
kxk−x∗x∥≤2δk. We thus get ∥x∗
kxk−(xx∗)k∥≤2δk+δ′
k.
Using
trUi⊗X[a,b]⊗Uj((xx∗)k,i,j) = trX[a,b]((xx∗)k,0,
