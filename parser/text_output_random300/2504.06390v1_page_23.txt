energy for four different polar substrates: h-BN, SiC, SiO2, and HfO2. This total response
is obtained by summing the linear and third-order nonlinear refractive indices. Panel (a)
shows the case without an electric field (F = 0), while panel (b) includes the effect of an
in-plane electric field (F = 0.3 V/nm), for magnetic field values of B = 0.05, 0.07, and 0.1 T.
Figure 7: Total relative refractive index (sum of linear and third-order nonlinear contribu-
tions) as a function of photon energy for polar substrates: h-BN, SiC, SiO2, and HfO2. (a)
Without electric field (F = 0); (b) with in-plane electric field (F = 0.3 V/nm).
The total refractive index curves retain the general dispersive profile observed in the linear
case, with both positive and negative shifts appearing near the polaron resonance energy.
This trend is expected, as the linear contribution dominates the overall magnitude, while
the nonlinear component acts as a perturbation that subtly shifts or distorts the features
rather than overrides them. Nevertheless, the influence of the nonlinear term is still visible,
particularly in the slight asymmetries and spectral displacements observed as the magnetic
field increases.
Increasing the magnetic field in both panels results in a progressive shift of the refrac-
