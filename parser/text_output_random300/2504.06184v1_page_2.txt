Introduction
The Regge limit [1] of 2 →2 scattering amplitudes is deﬁned as the limit in which the
squared center-of-mass energy s is much larger than the momentum transfer t.
In the
Regge limit, any 2 →2 scattering process is dominated by the exchange in the t channel of
the highest-spin particle. In the case of QCD or N = 4 Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory,
that entails the exchange of a gluon in the t channel. Contributions that do not feature
gluon exchange in the t channel are power suppressed in t/s.
In the Regge limit, virtual radiative corrections to the 2 →2 scattering amplitudes
and radiative emissions, i.e. 2 →n amplitudes with n ≥3, display universal, i.e. process-
independent, features, related to the ordering in rapidity of the outgoing particles. Building
upon that, the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) equation resums the radiative cor-
rections to parton-parton scattering to all orders at leading logarithmic (LL) [2–5] and
next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy [6–9] in log(s/|t|). The resummation of large
