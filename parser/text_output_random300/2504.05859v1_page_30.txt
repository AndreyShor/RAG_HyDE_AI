Δ𝐶𝐶 is modulated by the electric fields between MoSe2 and WS2, which is given by 
Δ𝐶𝐶= ∆𝐶𝐶
𝑖𝑖−𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑤𝑤𝐸𝐸𝑤𝑤−𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑑0𝐸𝐸0. 𝐸𝐸𝑤𝑤 and 𝐸𝐸0 are the electric fields in monolayer WS2 and 
inset hBN (Figure S3f), respectively, which is related by 𝜀𝜀𝑤𝑤𝐸𝐸𝑤𝑤= 𝜀𝜀𝜀𝜀0; ∆𝐶𝐶
𝑖𝑖 is the 
intrinsic Δ𝐶𝐶 with both of 𝐸𝐸𝑤𝑤 and 𝐸𝐸0 equal to 0 V/nm. For electron doped MoSe2 that 
is well grounded and can be treated as a metal, 𝐸𝐸0 is determined by the top gate, which 
gives 𝐸𝐸0 =

To experimentally determine Δ𝐶𝐶 at various 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷 and 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸, we measured the RC 
spectrum of resonances of MoSe2 and WS2 as a function of 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸 with 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷 fixed at 
various values, as shown in Figure S3a-e. As 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸 increases to a given value (𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸
∗), the 
AW resonance of WS2 gets suppressed which means that WS2 starts to get electron 
doped. At 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸
∗, we have ∆𝐶𝐶

doping-dependent 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸
