Theorem 1: The error ϵn = ∥|ψ(β)⟩−|ϕn⟩∥between the imaginary time evolved state |ψ(β)⟩and the state |ϕn⟩
created by n steps of RGD with step size ∆β = β
n is upper bound by
ϵn ≤5

Proof: We first note that the imaginary time evolved state |ψ(β)⟩= |ψn⟩can also be written in a recursive fashion as
|ψk⟩=
e−∆βH |ψk−1⟩
∥e−∆βH |ψk−1⟩∥.
(25)
By the triangle inequality and Lemma 1 we then find that the error ϵk after k steps is upper bounded by
ϵk = ∥Uϕk−1 |ϕk−1⟩−Uψk−1 |ψk−1⟩+ Uψk−1 |ψk−1⟩−|ψk⟩∥
(26)
≤∥Uϕk−1 |ϕk−1⟩−Uψk−1 |ψk−1⟩∥+ 6∆β2∥H∥2
∞,
(27)
omitting here the explicit dependence of Uϕk−1 and Uψk−1 on ∆β. We proceed by further upper bounding the first
term of the right-hand side. Consider
∥Uϕk−1 |ϕk−1⟩−Uψk−1 |ψk−1⟩∥
(28)
= ϵk−1 + ∆β∥[H, |ϕk−1⟩⟨ϕk−1|] |ϕk−1⟩−[H, |ψk−1⟩⟨ψk−1|] |ψk−1⟩∥+ Rϕk−1 + Rψk−1
(29)
= ϵk−1 + ∆β∥H(|ϕk−1⟩−|ψk−1⟩) −⟨ϕk−1| H |ϕk−1⟩|ϕk−1⟩+ ⟨ψk−1| H |ψk−1⟩|ψk−1⟩∥+ Rϕk−1 + Rψk−1
(30)
≤ϵk−1 + ∆β∥H∥∞ϵk−1 + ∆β∥⟨ϕk−1| H |ϕk−1⟩|ϕk−1⟩−⟨ψk−1| H |ψk−1⟩|ψk−1⟩∥+ Rϕk−1 + Rψk−1
(31)
where the remainder terms Rϕk−1 and Rψk−1 for the second order of the Taylor expansion of Uϕk−1 and Uψk−1
in ∆β can be upper bounded using again the Lagrange form of the remainder to find Rϕk−1 ≤2∆β2∥H∥2
∞and
Rψk−1 ≤2∆β2∥H∥2
∞. We thus obtain
∥Uϕk−1 |ϕk−1⟩−Uψk−1 |ψk−1⟩∥≤(1 + ∆β∥H∥∞)ϵk−1 + 4∆β2∥H∥2
∞
(32)
+ ∆β∥⟨ϕk−1| H |ϕk−1⟩|ϕk−1⟩−⟨ψk−1| H |ψk−1⟩|ψk−1⟩∥.
(33)
Defining |∆k−1⟩= |ψk−1⟩−|ϕk−1⟩, we get
⟨ψk−1| H |ψk−1⟩|ψk−1⟩= ⟨ϕk−1| H |ϕk−1⟩|ϕk−1⟩+ ⟨∆k−1| H |ϕk−1⟩|ϕk−1⟩
+ ⟨ψk−1| H |∆k−1⟩|ϕk−1⟩+ ⟨ψk−1| H |ψk−1⟩|∆k−1⟩,
(34)
and therefore
∥⟨ϕk−1| H |ϕk−1⟩|ϕk−1⟩−⟨ψk−1| H |ψk−1⟩|ψk−1⟩∥≤∥⟨∆k−1| H |ϕk−1⟩|ϕk−1⟩∥+ ∥⟨ψk−1| H |∆k−1⟩|ϕk−1⟩∥
+ ∥⟨ψk−1| H |ψk−1⟩|∆k−1⟩∥≤3∥H∥∞ϵk−1.
(35)
We then arrive at
∥Uϕk−1 |ϕk−1⟩−Uψk−1 |ψk−1⟩∥≤(1 + 4∆β∥H∥∞)ϵk−1 + 4∆β2∥H∥2
∞.
(36)
With (27) we hence obtain the recursive relation
ϵk ≤ϵk−1A + B
(37)
where A = 1 + 4∆β∥H∥∞and B = 10∆β2∥H∥2
∞. We simplify the final expressions by further upper bounding B to
find an upper bound for the error ϵn after n steps given by the geometric series
