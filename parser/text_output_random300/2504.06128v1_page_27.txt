where we applied (2.21) with LN “ AN for which ℓ“ p1 ´ aqϱ, see (2.18), and WN “ Nδ2ϱ
N
for which w “ ϱ, see (2.19) (and recall (2.25)).
The second contribution I2, when all times ni are after BN, corresponds to switching off
the noise in the whole interval r0, BNs, hence we have a partition function on the interval
pBN, Ns (whose length is LN “ N ´ BN „ N since b ă 1, that is (2.18) holds with ℓ“ 0)

WN “ BN, hence (2.19) holds with w “ p1 ´ bqϱ). We thus obtain by (2.21)
I2 „ p1 ´ bqϱ .
We finally consider the third contribution I3, when there are times ni both before AN
and after BN: recalling (2.17), we can write

where we recall that UβN p¨q was defined in (2.12). Summing over n we obtain UβN pN ´ dq,
see (2.13), and restricting the sum to d ď 1
2N we can bound UβN pN ´ dq ě UβN p1
2Nq.
Summing q2pd´gqp0q over BN ă d ď 1

This last expression vanishes for a “ b, which completes the proof of (4.20).
