Fig. 19. Substation’s local area networks have two
separate networks, one with relays, a relay controller,
and an outstation. The other with the local HMI, data-
base, and other local hosts.

HMI hosts, switches, routers, firewalls, and the BA
DMZ with the ICCP node.

radial topology, generation substations are linked to transmission substations based on the power
system’s branch information, as detailed in Table ??. The proposed tool creates cyber topology
for a synthetic power grid with 10,000 buses spanning western U.S.. In contrast, the other covers
the continental European grid with 289 nodes and some individual countries’ power systems. The
communication layer in the latter is split into physical and logical components, while the former
integrates a logical network layer equipped with routers, firewalls, and data flows.
