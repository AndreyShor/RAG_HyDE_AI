In Theorem 1.8, we consider the partition function ZβN

Theorem 2.5 (Variance of averaged partition functions). Let βN be in the quasi-
critical regime (1.22) for a given sequence 1 ! |ϑN| ! log N. Recall δN from (1.24).
Let us fix two exponents 0 ď ℓď w ă 8. For N P N we consider:
‚ two sequences LN P 2N (system size), WN ě 0 (scaling factor) such that, as N Ñ 8,
LN “ N pδ2
Nqℓ`op1q “ N e´ℓ|ϑN|`op|ϑN|q
with ℓě 0 ,
(2.18)
WN “ N pδ2
Nqw`op1q “ N e´w |ϑN|`op|ϑN|q
with w ě ℓ;
(2.19)
‚ probability mass functions φN : Z2
even Ñ r0, 8q “spread out” on scale ?WN in the
following sense (recall (2.9)):

Moreover, the convergence (2.21) holds uniformly over system sizes pLNqNPN, scaling factors
pWNqNPN and initial conditions pφNqNPN for which (2.18), (2.19), (2.20) hold uniformly.
Remark 2.6 (Sub-critical regime). Theorem 2.5 can also be applied to the sub-critical
regime (1.26): it suffices to take |ϑN| „ p1´ ˆβ2q log N with ˆβ2 P p0, 1q (cf. (1.22) and (1.26)),
but the final result (2.21) must be updated as follows:

The minor changes required in the proof are described in Remark A.2.
The proof of Theorem 2.5 is deferred to Appendix A. Condition (2.20) means intuitively
that, sampling two points x, y independently from φN, their distance |x ´ y| is roughly
order ?WN. This is made precise by the next results, also proved in Appendix A.
Proposition 2.7 (Equivalent condition for (2.20)). Let LN, WN be as in (2.18), (2.19).
Condition (2.20) for the probability mass functions φN is equivalent to

Proposition 2.8 (Sufficient condition for (2.20)). Let LN, WN be as in (2.18), (2.19).
For probability mass functions φN to satisfy (2.20) (or, equivalently, (2.23)) it suffices that
they are “mostly supported on a ball of radius ?WN with atoms of size Op1{WNq” in the
