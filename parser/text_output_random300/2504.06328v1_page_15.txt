data augmentation, and deploying the system on
actual quantum hardware to assess potential real-
world speedups.
Tie-Back to Geometric-Quantum Synergy.
Thus, the DFU classification study illustrates how
non-Euclidean descriptors (such as covariance-like
SPD matrices of image features) can be mapped
into an entangled quantum feature space. Our re-
sults show that this dual geometric-quantum ap-
proach can handle complex, high-variance medi-
cal imaging data, reinforcing the broader argu-
ment that quantum ML benefits significantly from
manifold-based representations.
The pipeline ex-
emplifies our overarching framework, where classi-
cal geometry guides feature extraction and quan-
tum circuits enhance expressiveness.
4.3. Related Work from the Research Community
In addition to our own studies, recent literature
has reported similar trends in the integration of ge-
ometric principles with quantum computing. For
instance:
• Researchers have applied quantum-enhanced
feature spaces in image recognition and molec-
ular modeling, demonstrating that quantum
kernels can outperform classical ones when
data is embedded onto curved manifolds [8, 20].
• Other
groups
have
explored
the
use
of
manifold-aware quantum circuits in robotics
and control, achieving improved performance
in tasks requiring the handling of geometric
transformations [23].
• In the healthcare domain, hybrid models com-
bining SPD-based representations with quan-
tum processing have been proposed for EEG
analysis and disease diagnosis, underscoring
the broad applicability of the geometric quan-
tum approach [15].
These works further validate the importance of
incorporating intrinsic geometric information into
quantum models, supporting our central thesis that
quantum machine learning, when combined with
classical geometric insights, offers a powerful new
paradigm for complex data analysis.
4.4. Summary and Implications
In summary, our case studies provide compelling
evidence that hybrid quantum-classical models,
which integrate SPD matrices, polynomial feature
expansion, and quantum circuits, can significantly
outperform classical approaches. The superior per-
formance of the SPD-Enhanced Hybrid model, as
shown by quantitative metrics, confirms the effec-
tiveness of aligning data representations with the
underlying geometric structure, both classically and
quantum mechanically.
Moreover, by including
both SHM and DFU as case studies—and referenc-
ing related work from the broader research commu-
nity—we demonstrate the broad applicability and
relevance of our approach. These results not only
validate our framework but also point to promising
directions for future research, including the deploy-
ment of these models on actual quantum hardware
to fully exploit their potential in real-world appli-
cations.
5. Future Directions and Open Questions
Having surveyed the foundations of Geometric
Quantum ML and highlighted some hybrid suc-
cess stories, we now turn to pressing open questions
and promising frontiers. While near-term QML re-
search often focuses on achieving quantum advan-
tage with small quantum processors, a deeper per-
spective involves systematically integrating quan-
tum geometry with advanced classical methods.
Below, we explore directions that could define the
next phase of research.
5.1. Quantum Large Language Models (Quantum
LLMs)
The explosive growth of large language models
(LLMs) like GPT has transformed natural language
processing. A quantum counterpart, a “quantum
LLM”, might exploit Hilbert-space embeddings for
text tokens, effectively representing linguistic con-
text in a high-dimensional quantum state space.
Conceptually:
• Each
token
or
text
sequence
could
be
amplitude-encoded into H ∼= C2n.
• Multi-qubit entangling circuits could represent
attention mechanisms or syntactic constraints
in a parameter-efficient way.
• The training objective (e.g., next-token predic-
tion) could be optimized via quantum natural
gradient on the manifold of circuit parameters.
