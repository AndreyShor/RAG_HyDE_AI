in a circularly-polarised background with c = +1 (see Eq.
(5)). In Fig. 2 (a) we see that for both helicity eigen-
states Γ3 = ±1 the concurrence is at its largest when
the created electron and positron have the same energy
(s = 0.5), and decreases as s goes to 0 or 1. In these lim-
its s →0, 1 we see a modulation in the concurrence due
to pulse-envelope effects. This effect can also be seen in
the probability spectra (right-hand axis) as the decrease
in probability away from s = 0.5 slows down. We can also
see that photons in a helicity state with Γ3 = −c, i.e. op-
posite to the laser rotation, create electron-positron pairs
with a stronger spin entanglement than those created by
photons with Γ3 = +c, i.e. parallel to the laser polarisa-
tion. Although difficult to see due to the log scale on the
plot, photons with Γ3 = −c also have a higher probability
of creating pairs than those with Γ3 = +c [72]. The vari-
ation of the concurrence spectrum C(s) with the photon
polarisation is plotted in Fig. 2 (b). We see that to have
strong spin entanglement we require the incident photon
to be highly polarised with |Γ3| ≈1.
Away from this
limit the entanglement quickly decreases to zero, with
the magenta dashed lines in Fig. 2 (b) outlining regions
where the concurrence is exactly zero.
Fig. 3 shows the variation of the concurrence with
the intensity in a circularly-polarised background with
c = +1. Fig. 3(a) shows how the concurrence varies for
Γ3 = ±1, with the curves split into regions where dif-
ferent approximations are used in the calculations.
In
the perturbative and intermediate intensity regimes the
concurrence is clearly plotted as two distinct curves; how-
ever, as the intensity is increased, these curves converge.
This behaviour can be explained by the formation length
becoming so short at high intensities that the pair is
formed instantaneously, therefore being insensitive to the
direction of rotation of photon polarisation, which varies
on a lengthscale of the order of a wavelength. It is note-
worthy that the LCFA does not become accurate un-
til ξ ≳10, i.e.
a slightly higher intensity than usual
when evaluating the scattering probability [63].
Over-
all, we can see that the photons with Γ3 = −c create
electron-positron pairs with a stronger spin entanglement
than created by photons with Γ3 = +c. In Fig. 3 (b),
the behaviour of the concurrence is plotted for partially-
polarised photons. The strongest entanglement requires
the incident photon to be highly polarised with |Γ3| ≈1.
With decreasing polarisation |Γ3|, the entanglement de-
creases quickly to zero; see the region surrounded by the
magenta dashed line in Fig. 3 (b). For completely un-
polarised photon Γ3 = 0, non-zero concurrence can only
appear in the perturbative regime, in which C = 0.18,
and in the region of ξ = 102 in which C < 0.1.
The variation of the concurrence with the photon en-
ergy η is presented in Fig. 4. In the low-energy, pertur-
bative regime where η < 0.04, the concurrence becomes
independent of the photon energy. In the plot for fully
polarised photons in Fig. 4 (a), as the photon energy is
increased from this low-energy regime, the concurrence
quickly falls, and then varies only slowly with η in the

merical data for 0.2 < ξ < 2 is from evaluating the full QED

intermediate energy regime (η ∼O(1)). Here, as in the
case of varying the intensity, the spin entanglement cre-
ated by the photon with Γ3 = −c polarised perpendicular
to the laser polarisation, is stronger than that created by
the photon with the parallel polarisation Γ3 = +c. As the
energy is further increased to the harmonic regime, the
concurrence clearly oscillates around the second (η = 5)
and first (η = 10) harmonic edges for photons polarised
with Γ3 = −c. At energies above this, the order of the
concurrence switches and the concurrence is highest for
pairs created by photons in the Γ3 = +c state.
Linearly polarised laser background - The concurrence
spectrum C(s) is plotted in Fig. 5 for pair-creation in a
linearly-polarised laser. In Fig. 5 (a) we see that simi-
lar to the circularly-polarised case, the degree of entan-
glement between the particles is largest when they have
the same energy and decreases as their energy difference
grows.
However in this case we see that at the limits
s →0, 1 the concurrence increases sharply. In contrast
to the circularly-polarised case, photons with polarisa-
tion parallel to the laser polarisation (Γ1 = +1) create
