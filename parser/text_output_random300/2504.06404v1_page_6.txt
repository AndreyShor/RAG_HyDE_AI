Fitting the physical spline to standing objects could lead to a 
small shaking around zero velocity. It is mostly a cosmetic 
problem, because the effect is really small and has no cumulative 
drift.  However lightly shaking standing objects are visually 
unpleasant when you generate a birds eye video of a moving car. 
To avoid that we introduce a regularization of order -1 to prefer 
smaller velocities. This regularisation is against the principle of 
momentum conservation. Thus this regularization will only be 
active during phases of longer intervals with zero velocity and 
skipped otherwise.  The error function would be (21)

V. EXTENSIONS FOR HEADING 
We can estimate the heading with the same model by 
introducing static nonlinearities, that get solved before and after 
the fitting. The functions fx and fy will be replaced with fsin and 
fcos . With this modelling we resolve the periodic nature of the 
heading. After the fitting the heading can be recreated with the 
following formular  
𝑓;<=(𝑡) = & 𝑓#(𝑡) ⋅𝑤#
&
#
 
 
(22) 
𝑓=+0(𝑡) = & 𝑓#(𝑡) ⋅𝑤#
&
#
 
 
 
𝜓= arctan2h𝑓;<=(𝑡), 𝑓=+0(𝑡)i.

VI. RESULTS AND USE CASES 
A. Post processed trajectory optimization 
Our main use case for the physical Spline is the improvement 
of recorded object tracks in the post processing. The tracks were 
recorded with the sensors of an autonomous vehicle (Lidar, 
Radar, Camera). The results can later be used for analysis or as 
pseudo ground truth for machine learning models. The physical 
spline delivers kinematically consistent object tracks that make 
use of the advantage that in post processing we already have 
access to the whole object track. In case of an online 
implementation the physical spline would have to be 
implemented as a moving horizon estimator (see further in [5]). 
To tune the physical spline, we equipped another vehicle with 
a high precision GNSS system that was optimized later with a 
PPK approach. The recorded data was used as benchmark to 
compare the recorded Lidar/Radar/Camera measurements. The 
results look very promising. Fig 6 shows the raw data in blue 
and the improved data with the physical spline in orange. Each 
subplot shows another signal of the object track. In Fig. 7 we 
can see additionally in green the ground truth of the high 
precision measurement device that was mounted inside of the 
tracked vehicle for reference. We can see that the physical 
spline corrects many errors. Due to its consistency with the 
physics of the vehicle, the jumps in the input measurement 
signals were not possible and dominated by the correct 
influence of other measured signals. The worst performance we 
can see at the corner of the object track. Especially the heading
