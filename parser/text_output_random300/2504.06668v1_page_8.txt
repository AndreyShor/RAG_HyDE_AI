Let Ni denote the neighborhood of agent Ai in the network (i.e., the set of
agents connected to Ai).
In addition to individual-level latent factors such as education, contraceptive
use, and parental guidance, we introduce peer-group pressure through network
interactions.
Peer pressure affects behaviors such as contraceptive use or
substance abuse.
Define peer influence PIi(t) as a function of the behaviors of agent Ai’s
neighbors in the network. For example, contraceptive use Ci(t) and substance
abuse SAbi(t) can be influenced by the agent’s neighborhood as follows:
PIC
i (t) =
1
|Ni|
X
j∈Ni
Cj(t)
PISAb
i
(t) =
1
|Ni|
X
j∈Ni
SAbj(t)
Here, PIC
i (t) is the average contraceptive use in agent Ai’s network, and
PISAb
i
(t) is the average level of substance abuse in the network.
Agents also exist within a broader socio-economic environment, modeled
as a collection of interconnected communities or regions. Each environment
has its own characteristics, which affect the agents within it.
Let R denote the set of regions, and each agent Ai belongs to a region
Rk ∈R. Each region has the following characteristics:
• Regional Deprivation Dk(t): A continuous variable representing the
degree of socioeconomic hardship in region Rk at time t.
• Regional Violence Vk(t): A binary variable representing the prevalence
of violence in region Rk at time t.
• Regional Education Quality EQk: A continuous variable representing
the quality of education available in region Rk.
These regional factors interact with the individual-level factors and peer-
group dynamics.
The probability of pregnancy incorporates both social network effects and
regional-level socio-economic environmental influences. Define the pregnancy
probability as:
