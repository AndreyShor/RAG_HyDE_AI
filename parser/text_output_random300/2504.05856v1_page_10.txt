SN Ia sample at the mean, while the horizontal lines mark log10(M/M⊙) = 10, commonly used for splitting SNe Ia samples into
high- and low-mass hosts.
6.6. NIR light-curve standardization
Following the correlation found between Y-band peak absolute
magnitude (MY) and the PCA components (see Sect. 6.3.1), we
proceed to test the standardization of the Y-band light curves
of SNe Ia by adding correction parameters for the estimation of
distances:
µSN = (mY + α × p0 + β × p1) −MY,
(2)
where mY is the Y-band peak apparent magnitude, and α and
β are nuisance parameters. We follow a similar procedure as in
Galbany et al. (2023), but fix H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1 and fit for M
and σint (SN intrinsic scatter), with the addition of α and β. Since
H0 is fixed, distances from the calibrating SNe are not needed to
anchor the y-axis in the Hubble diagram to break the degeneracy
between H0 and M.
Figure 13 shows the corner plot of the Markov-chain Monte-
Carlo (MCMC) posterior distributions of the fitted parameters
used for building the Y-band Hubble diagram with standard-
ization (Fig. 14). The addition of standardization parameters is
favoured by around 3σ and 2σ significance for p0 and p1, re-
spectively. Additionally, by correcting the light curves, σint is
reduced from 0.21 mag to 0.17 mag.
While the standardization in the Y band is favoured, the J and
H bands do not present any improvements with the addition of
other parameters, reflecting their uniformity. The standardization
using the PCA components from the NIR color curves is studied
in Appendix B.
7. Summary & Conclusions
In this work, we have gathered a sample of 47, 36 and 25 SNe Ia
with well-sampled YJH-band light curves, respectively, to an-
alyze their variability with PCA, a common machine-learning
technique. SNe Ia were selected from various sources, includ-
ing the CSP, CfAIR2, RATIR, and DEHVILS surveys, as well
as some objects from the literature. Each selected object has
at least five NIR photometric epochs in any band, with cover-
age spanning from the first to the second peak. The light curves
were corrected for K-correction and Milky Way extinction using
SNooPy, then interpolated with PISCOLA to achieve continuous
rest-frame coverage.
When decomposing the NIR light curves, each indepen-
dently, using three PCA components (C0, C1 and C2) explains
∼90% of the variability, with the first component explaining
around 50% of it. The C0 component of the J and H bands (C1
for the Y band) shows that brighter secondary peaks also occur
at later epochs, and vice versa. With a somewhat opposing ef-
fect, the C1 component of the H band (C0 for the Y band) shows
that brighter secondary peaks occur at earlier epochs, while this
component mainly just contributes to the brightness for the J
band. A possible explanation for the NIR bands to show differ-
ent dominant behaviors is that the PCA components could be
tracing different physical properties, such as the effect of MNi,
metallicity or MFe on the time of recombination of iron-group
elements, and, subsequently, on the secondary peak. When com-
paring to observations and theoretical models, a difference in the
elements abundance is seen for the different wavelengths ranges
each of the bands probes, possibly explaining some of the differ-
ences seen with the PCA components.
When comparing the PCA coefficients (p0 and p1) against
different light-curve parameters, some interesting trends are
found. The NIR peak absolute magnitude correlates with p0 for
the Y band, which could imply some correlation between sec-
ondary peak brightness and MNi. However, the same correlations
are not seen for the J and H bands. Nonetheless, the optical peak
brightness, which can be used as a proxy for MNi, correlates with
p1 for the Y band and p0 for the J band, suggesting a possible di-
minishing influence of MNi in the secondary peak towards redder
wavelengths.
We also compared the PCA coefficients against host-galaxy
properties, in particular, stellar mass and color excess, but found
no clear correlations. However, we cannot say whether the envi-
ronment does not affect the secondary NIR peak. A larger sample
and, in particular, a comparison with other host-galaxy proper-
ties, such as star formation rate and metallicity, would be needed
to draw a strong conclusion.
The PCA decomposition was also applied on the NIR color
curves of the SNe Ia, where over 50% of the variance is ex-
plained by the first component (C0). Although the physical in-
terpretation of these is more complex, we still compared them
against light-curve properties. We found correlations between
the C0 component and peak optical brightness (i.e. MNi) for
all the NIR colours, showing that SNe with larger amounts
of MNi have redder NIR colors. When comparing to the same
host properties as before, we found a tentative correlation with
log10(M/M⊙), where SNe Ia with redder NIR colors are found
on less massive galaxies (potentially more metal-poor) environ-
ments. The comparison against E(B −V)host shows some corre-
