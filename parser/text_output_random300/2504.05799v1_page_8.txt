For the general type II 2HDM, the Higgs alignment limit conditions have been obtained
which are valid within the dimension-six decomposition of the eﬀective Higgs potential for the
neutral Higgs bosons with indeﬁnite CP-parity h1, h2 or h3. Numerical investigations within the
MSSM reveal that the only hI
1-alignment limit takes place. For any tan β parameter, additional
Higgs bosons decouple and are heavier than 1 TeV. No possibility for a neutral Higgs scalar
with a mass of 95 GeV remains. For investigating the main phenomenological features relevant
for future collider searches, four benchmark scenarios have been proposed. Two of them predict
distinguishable CP-violating interactions of the Higgs boson h3 with up-fermions.
Note that the above analysis refers to the generic basis for the type II 2HDM potential.
CP-violating ﬂavor-aligned 2HDM was also analyzed in [16] where the Higgs alignment limit
conditions were obtained for the h1 state in the Higgs basis. Basis-independent methods de-
veloped for the 2HDM in [44] allow in principle to construct explicit representations for the
couplings and mixing angles in the mass eigenstate basis in terms of 2HDM invariants (quanti-
ties that are scalar under arbitrary unitary transformations among the two Higgs ﬁelds in the
Lagrangian) also for the extended Higgs potential, which is beyond the scope of this work.
