⟨ˆuω(−t), ˆyω(t)⟩dtdω
(26)
where we have used Fubini’s theorem to interchange the
order of integration. The right-hand sides of (25) and (26)
are equal because of (24), hence the left-hand sides are also
equal, which concludes the proof.
The right-hand side of (23) can be seen as the inner
product between past input and future output. In fact, it is
the quadratic functional obtained from the Hankel operator
of the system, i.e., the operator that maps the past input
to the future output. We formalize this in the next section.
Before we do that, we illustrate the results of this section
with the diffusion equation and then conclude with a couple
of remarks.
Example 2: In Example 1, we saw that the diffusion
equation (2) is an LTSI system that is internally of relaxation
type. The state and output of this system are equal, hence,
due to Theorem 4, it is impedance passive with the well-
known energy storage E(t) =
R
R y(t, x)2 dx of the diffusion
equation. In particular, (23) reduces to
Z
R
y(0, x)2 dx =

Z
R
u(−t, x)y(t, x) dxdt,
(27)
which, due to Plancherel’s theorem, is equivalent to
Z
R
|ˆy(0, ω)|2 dω =
Z ∞

Z
R
ˆu(−t, ω)ˆy(t, ω)∗dωdt,
(28)
Note that the future output y(t, x), t ≥0, is the solution of
the diffusion equation (2) for u(t, x) = 0, t ≥0, and initial
condition y(0, x). Therefore, in the frequency domain, we
have that ˆy(t, ω) = ˆg(t, ω)ˆy(0, ω), where
ˆy(0, ω) =
Z 0
−∞
ˆg(−t, ω)ˆu(t, ω) dt
(29)
Multiplying the latter by ˆy(t, ω)∗and rearranging yields
|ˆy(0, ω)|2 =
Z ∞
0
ˆu(−t, ω)ˆy(t, ω)∗dt
(30)
where we used the fact that ˆg(t, ω) is real and, thus,
ˆy(t, ω)∗= ˆg(t, ω)ˆy(0, ω)∗
(31)
Integrating both sides of (30) yields (28), hence the energy
storage of the diffusion equation can be determined the past
input, which conﬁrms the result of Theorem 4.
Remark 3: LTSI relaxation systems are not necessarily
impedance passive. To see this, suppose that the LTSI system
Σ is of relaxation type, hence, due to Theorem 1, the
LTI system ˆΣω is of relaxation type and, thus, passive for
all ω ∈Rs. This implies that there exist ˆQω ∈Cn×n,
ˆQω ≥0, ω ∈Rs, such that (21) holds, but it does not
imply that supω∈Rs∥ˆQω∥< ∞. It is argued in [16] that
cases where such boundedness conditions are violated are
artiﬁcial mathematical constructs rather than real physical
examples. This is because at large frequencies, the dominant
mechanism in physical systems is dissipation, i.e., the LTI
system ˆΣω becomes “more stable” as ω →∞.
Remark 4: In some references [18], [19], the deﬁnition of
impedance passivity requires the storage to be strictly posi-
tive rather than merely nonnegative. In fact, it is sometimes
assumed [20] that the storage is the squared norm of the state.
These deﬁnitions coincide with the deﬁnition in this paper if
we further impose that Q > 0 such that ∥z∥Q =
p
⟨Qz, z⟩
deﬁnes a norm on the state space Z. In any case, Theorem 4
shows that LTSI systems that are internally of relaxation type
are impedance passive even under these modiﬁed deﬁnitions.
VI. THE HANKEL OPERATOR AND RELAXATION
In this subsection, we will show that relaxation can be
characterized via the Hankel operator. In particular, we will
show that an exponentially stable LTSI system is of relax-
ation type if and only if its Hankel operator is self-adjoint
and nonnegative. Consequently, the Hankel operator of an
LTSI relaxation system is cyclically monotone and, thus, the
gradient of a closed convex functional, which coincides with
the (impedance) passive storage of Theorem 4.
The Hankel operator of the LTSI system Σ is the linear
operator H : D(H) →L2(R+, Y) given by
(Hv)(t) =
Z
R+
G(t + τ)v(τ) dτ
(32)
where D(H) ⊂L2(R+, U). The Hankel operator maps past
inputs to future outputs in the sense that the input given
by u(t) = v(−t) for t ≤0 and u(t) = 0 for all t > 0,
results in the output given by y(t) = (Hv)(t) for all t ≥0.
The domain of H is nontrivial only if the system is stable.
Here, we will assume that Σ is exponentially stable, i.e., there
exists constants M, α > 0 such that ∥exp(At)∥≤Me−αt
for all t ∈R+, see [15, Section 4.1] for details. Then, we
obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 5: If the LTSI system Σ is exponentially stable,
then the Hankel operator H extends to a bounded linear
operator from L2(R+, U) to L2(R+, Y).
Proof: Note that exp(A(t+τ)) = exp(At) exp(Aτ) by
deﬁnition of a semigroup, hence
(Hv)(t) = C exp(At)
Z
R+
exp(Aτ)Bv(τ) dτ.
(33)
Let the linear operator B∞: L2(R+, U) →Z be given by
(B∞v)(t) =
Z
R+
exp(Aτ)Bv(τ) dτ
(34)
and the linear operator C∞: Z →L2(R+, Y) by
(C∞z)(t) = C exp(At)z
(35)
The operators B∞and C∞are known as the extended
controllability and observability maps, respectively, see [15,
Section 6.4] for details. They are well-deﬁned and bounded
if Σ is exponentially stable, hence H = C∞B∞is a bounded
linear operator from L2(R+, U) to L2(R+, Y).
In [3], it is shown that a stable LTI system is of relaxation
type if and only if its Hankel operator is self-adjoint and
