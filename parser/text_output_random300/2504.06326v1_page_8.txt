Figure 4. Case 1: Characteristically near stable vector fields
of the overall stability of the vector fields emanating from any vibrating system at
different times. For simplicity, we consider only the maximum eigenvalues of the
vector field in each videa frame.
Example 7. (Case 1:
Pair of Characteristically Close Stable Vector
Fields).
In Fig. 4, contains a pair of characteristically near stable vector fields ⃗V ffr77, ⃗V ffr94
in frames 77 and 94. Observe
maxλfr77 = 0.67,
maxλfr94 = 0.91,
||0.67| −|−0.91|| = 0.24 ∈[0, 0.5]; Hence, from characteristic φ5(Sg),
⃗V ffr77 eδΦ ⃗V ffr94.

Example 8. (Case 2: Pair of Characteristically Close Unstable Vector
Fields).
In Fig. 5, contains a pair of unstable vector fields ⃗V ffr71, ⃗V ffr88 in frames 71 and
