Figure 4: Circuit for block-encoding the non-local term V i,I
NL in Eq. (108). The notation Pl refers to the
computation of the Legendre polynomial in Step 2 below. Note that we have slightly modified the circuit
relative to the prescription in the text so that it is manifestly self-inverse.
We divide this into a sequence of two unitaries as PREPNL = PREPNL,2 · PREPNL,1, with action

the quantum algorithm with appropriate data loading subroutines. The state in Eq. (112) is prepared
using coherent alias sampling. The state in Eq. (113) is prepared using rejection sampling (Ref. [75]),
in combination with the equivalent reference state for the local term (see Type I reference state in
App. C). More specifically, for the non-local term we use rejection sampling to prepare a state with
amplitudes proportional to |GζI,l
α | and then we manually add signs to the parts of the domain where G
becomes negative (note that the functions G are real-valued by definition). The relevant piece of the
quantum circuit operates in the following order:
(a) Conditioned on l, α, ζI, prepare a reference state

α (kp2¯rζI

for some function ˜GζI,l

≥|GζI,l
α | everywhere in the domain.
(b) Conditioned on l, α, ζI, p2, compute an approximation to the function | ¯GζI,l
α (kp2¯rζI
l )⟩, where
¯GζI,l
α (kp2¯rζI
l ) = |GζI,l
α (|kp2|¯rζI
l )|/ ˜GζI,l
α (kp2¯rζI
l ), to an ancilla register.
(c) Prepare a uniform superposition over m = 1 . . . M amplitudes (we assume that M is a power of
two).
(d) Use an inequality test to set an ancilla to 0 when m ≤M|GζI,l
α (|kp2|¯rζI
l )|/ ˜GζI,l
α (kp2¯rζI
l ) (and to
1 otherwise).
(e) Use oblivious amplitude amplification to amplify the zero branch of the flag.
(f) Flip the sign of the resultant state for each kp2 where GζI,l
α (|kp2|¯rζI
l ) < 0.
2. Then, given that we have the registers p1 (the system register) and p2 (an ancilla register that is created
with PREP in the first step), we apply the block-encoding of the diagonal matrix whose elements are
the values of the Legendre polynomials.
This operation is controlled only on l. Namely, it is the
block-encoding of
