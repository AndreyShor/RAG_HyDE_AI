narrowing the resource gap between the two subpopulations. These findings suggest that the
resource availability within different game types significantly influences cooperation rates,
with wealthier individuals exhibiting a stronger tendency toward cooperation. Furthermore,
µ not only fosters cooperation across the system but also mitigates resource inequality
between different social dilemmas and strategies.
The second row in Fig. 10 shows the evolution of the mean resources of cooperators and
defectors in the entire system, ΥSDG, and ΥPDG for µ = 0.2 and σ = 0.5. The corresponding
results for other values of σ (σ = 0.05, 0.1, 0.8, 1.0) are presented in Fig. A4 (Appendix). It
can be observed that when σ is small (σ = 0.05, 0.1, 0.5), cooperators maintain significantly
higher resource levels than defectors across the entire system, ΥSDG, and ΥPDG, which is
consistent with earlier findings.
As σ increases, the average resources of cooperators in
ΥSDG decline, while defectors’ resources increase. However, in ΥPDG, the average resources
of both cooperators and defectors decline continuously. This indicates that as σ increases,
individuals in ΥPDG experience stronger dilemmas, making them more vulnerable to being
replaced by strategies from individuals in ΥSDG. These results demonstrate that σ plays a
critical role in determining the resource distribution among individuals adopting different
strategies. While a higher σ enhances resource acquisition for individuals in ΥSDG, it also
exacerbates the disparity in resource distribution between ΥSDG and ΥPDG.
To further examine how individuals’ games and strategy choices interplay with resource
availability, we classify individuals into 11 groups based on their resource levels once the
system stabilizes. The total number of individuals, resource levels, and cooperation frac-
tions for the entire system, ΥSDG, and ΥPDG are presented in Table III. Regardless of the
value of b, we observe that individuals in ΥPDG are predominantly concentrated in lower
resource intervals (below 1.7), whereas individuals in ΥSDG are primarily found in higher
resource intervals. Furthermore, the individuals’ resource distribution is highly imbalanced.
In the lowest resource interval, approximately 60% of individuals are concentrated, yet they
collectively hold only about 1% of the total system resources. As resource levels increase,
the cooperation fraction rises across the entire system, as well as within ΥPDG and ΥSDG.
At any given resource level, the cooperation fraction is highest in ΥSDG and lowest in ΥPDG.
Additionally, b has a pronounced effect on the cooperation fraction across different resource
intervals. As b increases, cooperation levels decline within the same resource interval. This
analysis further confirms that cooperative behaviors in different dilemmas are closely linked
