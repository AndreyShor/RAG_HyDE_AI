and χ0, it is either timelike everywhere or spacelike every-
where, and only assumes null values whenever ¯s →−∞.
For this reason, let us now briefly focus on the ϵ = 1
case and define the vector
K = xA + ϵ tB .
(64)
The vector Kµ is most decidedly not an autoparal-
lel Killing vector, but its algebra resembles a deformed
Poincar´e algebra,
[A, K]T = B|T →2T ,
(65)
[B, K]T = A|T →2T ,
(66)
where by “T →2T” we mean the substitution τ0 →2τ0
and χ0 →2χ0. Naturally, the norm of Kµ is that of a
boost Killing vector,
K · K = t2 −ϵx2 .
(67)
Last, note that the autoparallel Killing equation for Kµ
is proportional to sinh s, implying that Kµ is a Killing
vector provided
s|ϵ=1 = tτ0 −xχ0 = 0 .
(68)
While seeming far-fetched, we note that this condition is
satisfied on the horizon of a two-dimensional black hole
with null torsion. This brings us to the application of the
above principles to static two-dimensional black holes in
the presence of torsion (and, under certain assumptions,
to four-dimensional black holes as well).
For completeness, we would like to close this section by
some comments on the autoparallel equation of motion in
constant torsion backgrounds, with a particular focus on
conserved quantities. For the sake of simplicity, we focus
here solely on the spacetime case ϵ = +1. Parametrizing
the 2-velocity of a particle as uµ = (˙t, ˙x), we may write
its normalization condition as (σ = −1 for a massive
particle, σ = 0 for a massless particle)
gµνuµuν = σ = −˙t2 + ˙x2 .
(69)
The quantities E = −gµνAµuν and P = +gµνBµuν are
the conserved energy and momentum, respectively. They
take the explicit form
E = ˙t cosh s −˙x sinh s ,
P = ˙x cosh s −˙t sinh s ,
(70)
which, when solved for ˙t and ˙x, gives
˙t = E cosh s + P sinh s ,
˙x = P cosh s + E sinh s . (71)
Substituting this into the normalization condition then
gives the dispersion relation
σ = −E2 + P 2 .
(72)
There also appears to be a third conserved quantity,
Q = gµνCµuν =
1
τ 2
0 −χ2
0
e¯s(−τ0 ˙t + χ0 ˙r) .
(73)
While one may verify that this quantity is indeed con-
stant under autoparallel motion for general τ0 and χ0,
its physical interpretation remains elusive.

APPLICATION TO BLACK HOLES
With the Killing vectors of flat spacetime and their
counterparts in the presence of constant non-vanishing
torsion introduced, let us now connect those topics to
basic properties of static black holes in two (and, later,
four) spacetime dimensions. This means we shall set
ϵ = 1
(74)
and exclusively consider the setting of spacetime. Static
flat spacetime admits the existence of the hypersurface
orthogonal timelike Killing vector eAµ satisfying
eA[µ e∇ν eAρ] = 0 .
(75)
Clearly, since ∇µAν = 0, this definition of staticity car-
ries over to the case of constant torsion. These are all
ingredients required to track the influence of the presence
of torsion onto the surface gravity of static, spherically
symmetric two-dimensional black holes (and, addition-
ally, to a subclass of four-dimensional ones).
A.
Two-dimensional static black holes
Let us now, in this two-dimensional setting, imagine a
black hole geometry. That is, for the moment we shall
depart from the translational symmetry in the spatial
direction, and consider the line element
ds2 = −f(r) dT 2 + dr2
f(r) ,
(76)
where we denote the spatial direction by r and label the
time coordinate T in order to distinguish them from the
flat spacetime coordinates x and t. Now, given a metric
function f(r) that asymptotes to unity at large distances
but has a zero at finite radius rh and is positive through-
out r ∈(rh, ∞), we shall call this a black hole geometry.
The metric function f(r), close to the horizon rh, hence
admits the expansion
f(r ≈rh) = 2eκ(r −rh) + O

(r −rh)2
,
(77)
where the expansion coefficient eκ is called the surface
gravity in the context of Riemannian geometry of general
relativity,
eκ ≡1
2f ′(rh) .
(78)
Using methods of Euclidean gravity, it is related to the
associated Hawking temperature eTH via
eTH = eκ
2π .
(79)
It is then useful to introduce a new set of coordinates
that originates at the horizon. To that end, we define
the near-horizon coordinate z via
r = rh + eκ
2 z2 .
