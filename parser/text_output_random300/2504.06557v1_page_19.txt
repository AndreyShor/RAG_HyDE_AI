In Fig 4, regarding the mean clustering coefficient 𝐶 (blue lines), (a) the 
market economy (A1) has the largest value and the smallest fluctuation. This is because 
the network is concentrated at some nodes owing to the enclosure and does not change 
significantly, even if the edges are deleted. In (b) the power economy (B1), the value is 
smaller than in (a) the market economy (A1) owing to the mitigation of the enclosure. 
In (c) the gift economy (C1) and (d) the concession economy (D1), the values increase 
as the steps progress but fluctuate dynamically around 0.04, owing to edge deletion. 
 Regarding the graph density 𝐷 (green lines), the value for (a) the market 
economy (A1) is roughly 0.02 as the steps progress, and the values for the other (b) 
power economy (B1), (c) gift economy (C1), and (d) concession economy (D1) are 0.04 
at step 𝑡 =  200. The value of 0.04 is determined from total degree 400 (= number of 
nodes 𝑛 × mean degree 𝑘𝜇) and Eq (3). In (a), the market economy (A1), the value is 
smaller than 0.04 because the network is concentrated in some nodes. 
 Regarding reciprocity 𝑅 (blue lines), in (a) the market economy (A2), (b) 
the power economy (B2), and (c) the gift economy (C2), the values are always 1 because 
bidirectional edges (exchange or obligation to return) are generated. In contrast, in (d) 
the concession economy (D2), the value is small because unidirectional edges (the 
obligation to return) are randomly generated, and bidirectional edges are rarely 
generated by chance. 
 Regarding assortativity 𝑆 (green lines), the values are small in the (a) 
market economy (A2), (b) power economy (B2), (c) gift economy (C2), and (d) 
concession economy (D2). This is because the edges are randomly generated without 
relying on a specific probability distribution. The fluctuation in the value of (a), the 
market economy (A2), is small because, as already mentioned, the network remains
