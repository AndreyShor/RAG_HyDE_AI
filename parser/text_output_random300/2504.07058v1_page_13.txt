If 𝑈satisfies the evolution equation (2.10):

(2.70)
Since the integrand is non-positive,
𝑑𝐸
𝑑𝑡⩽0.
(2.71)
Thus, 𝐸(𝑈) is non-increasing, ensuring energy dissipation and stability of the system.
𝐸(𝑈) ⩽𝐸(𝑈0).
(2.72)
Using Poincar´e’s inequality in the energy dissipation property,
∥𝑈∥𝐿2⩽𝐶1
𝛾∥𝑈0∥𝐿2.
(2.73)
An application of the Sobolev embedding theorem then gives
∥𝑈∥𝐿∞⩽𝐶1
𝛾∥𝑈0∥𝐿2.
(2.74)
Thus, 𝑈is uniformly bounded in 𝐿∞, completing the proof.

Convergence of multilayer neural network
This section establishes 𝐿2 bounds and analyzes the convergence of the multilayer neural network 𝑈𝑛for both
models. From 2.2.1
D(𝑈𝑛) = f.
(2.75)
Additionally, assume that for each f ∈𝑌∗, a unique solution 𝑢∈𝑋∗exists for (2.14), subject to approximate
boundary and initial conditions given by
B(𝑈𝑛) = 𝑈𝑛
𝑏
on 𝜕D,
𝑈𝑛(0, 𝑥) = 𝑈𝑛
0
on D.
(2.76)
Here, B represents a boundary operator, 𝑈𝑛
𝑏is the prescribed boundary data, and 𝑈𝑛
0 denotes the initial condition.
