To further analyze the influence of limited resources on the evolution of cooperation in this
multi-game model, we examine the relationship between players’ resource quantities, game-
based subpopulations, and strategic choices as a function of µ and σ. Based on the quantity
of resources owned, players are divided into two groups: the richer group (individuals with
more than one unit of resources) and the poorer group (individuals with less than one unit
of resources).
The first row in Fig. 9 presents the time evolution, in MCS, of the fraction of cooperation
in the entire system, as well as in the richer and poorer groups, when µ = 0.5 and σ = 0.2.
The results for additional values of µ = 0, 0.2, 0.8, 1.0 are shown in the Appendix, Fig. A1.
In Fig. 9(a) and the first column of Fig. A1, the red line represents the cooperation levels in
the richer group, while the blue line represents the cooperation levels in the poorer group.
It can be observed that when µ = 0, µ = 0.2, and µ = 0.5, the cooperation fraction initially
decreases, reaching its minimum after approximately 5 MCS. Subsequently, cooperation in-
creases until reaching a peak at around 100 MCS, after which it stabilizes. The overall trend
for the poorer group follows a similar pattern but remains consistently lower in magnitude.
When the system reaches a steady state, the cooperation levels in the richer group are about
1.2 times those of the poorer group. In Fig. 9(b) and Fig. 9(c), as well as the second and
third columns in Fig. A1, show the evolution of the fraction of cooperation in the richer and
poorer groups over time within ΥSDG and ΥPDG, respectively. The overall trends are con-
sistent with those observed for the entire system. However, in the early stages of evolution,
both richer and poorer groups in ΥPDG exhibit lower cooperation levels than in ΥSDG and
the overall system. Notably, in ΥPDG, the fraction of cooperation in the poorer group ini-
tially surpasses that of the richer group by a significant margin until it reaches its minimum
value. This phenomenon can be attributed to the nature of the social dilemmas and the ran-
dom endorsement of strategies. At the beginning of the simulation, strategies are randomly
distributed within ΥSDG and ΥPDG, which initially benefits defectors. Furthermore, since
ΥPDG is characterized by a stronger dilemma compared to ΥSDG, the minimum cooperation
level in ΥPDG is lower than in ΥSDG. Additionally, cooperators in ΥPDG face a significant
disadvantage, making them more susceptible to strategy replacement and resource loss. As
a result, cooperative behavior in ΥPDG remains at a lower level. On the other hand, as
µ increases, this disadvantage is mitigated, improving cooperative behavior throughout the
evolutionary process in the entire system, ΥSDG, and ΥPDG. Through this analysis, it can
