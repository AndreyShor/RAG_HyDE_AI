Reference states for quantum rejection sampling
We provide the 3 classes of reference states used in quantum rejection sampling throughout the algorithm.
To compute success probabilities of the target states below (excluding the 1d quantum harmonic oscillator
case), we use the NH3BF3 instance, although the results are fairly insensitive to the exact problem instance.
C.1
Type I (Constant with exponential tail)
This reference state is used for the state preparation routine PREPloc,2 (Eq. (103)) for s ≥0 in the local
term block-encoding, for the state preparation routine PREPNL,2 (Eq. (113)) in the non-local term block-
encoding, and a 1-dimensional version is used for preparation of the quantum harmonic oscillator eigenstates
(Eq. (73)). We construct a piecewise function with two regions, wherein the function is uniform in the inner
region and an exponential tail in the outer region.
Non-local and local terms
In the case of the non-local term (Eq. (200) reproduced here),

where b(j)
α
is the j-th Cartesian component of reciprocal vector bα. Note that this form is indeed a product
over each Cartesian direction making it to easy prepare. For the s ≥0 terms, instead of parameters l, α,
we have parameter s such that ˜Gζ,l
α (kp¯rζ
l ) →˜Gζ
s(kp¯rζ
loc) as seen in Eq. (201), and we have the simple
formula that maxp | ˜Gζ
s(kp¯rζ
loc)| = ( 2s
e )s/2 for s = 1, 2, 3 and 1 for s = 0. For the non-local (local) term,
we choose parameters k∗, d that have explicit dependence solely on l (s), while γ is chosen to be constant.
The parameters k∗, γ have implicit dependence on ζ through ¯rζ
l (¯rζ
loc) for the non-local (local) term. The
parameters are summarized in Table 9, where we drop all the parameter labels since they are clear from
context.
In Fig. 8, we show the (unnormalized) Type I reference states (for non-local and s ≥0) bounding
the target functions along the p1 and p3 axes for the pseudoion ζ = Cu11. On the left hand side, columns
represent l-values and rows represent the eigenstate values α = 1, 2, 3. On the right hand side, the same cuts
for s ≥0 are shown. While the reference function may not always appear to tightly bind the target function
along any specific cut for a given set of parameters, the overall probability of success, approximately given
by the ratio of the volume integrals of the squared functions,

are sufficiently large to ensure that for most pseudoions ζ and cases l, α, only 1-2 rounds of amplification
are required to restore the full norm of the target function. This is apparent in Fig. 9, where we show
the success probabilities of preparing the target function for a substantial selection of pseudoions (though
