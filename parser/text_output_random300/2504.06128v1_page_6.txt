Hölder spaces is recalled in Subsection 3.4). Since positive Hölder spaces Cε consist of
functions, this shows that, in a sense, the SHF Z ϑ
t pdxq barely fails to be a function.
Theorem 1.5 (Regularity of the SHF). Fix any t ą 0 and ϑ P R. Almost surely, the
SHF Z ϑ
t pdxq belongs to C0´ :“ Ş
εą0 C´ε and, hence, contains no atoms.
The results above are proved in Section 3. The proof of Theorems 1.2 and 1.5 are based
on the approximation of the SHF via partition functions of directed polymers, which was
used in the original construction of the SHF in [CSZ23a] and will be recalled next.
1.3. Results for directed polymers. To define the directed polymer model, let
S “ pSnqně0 be the simple symmetric random walk on Z2 with law P and expectation E.
We denote its transition kernel by
qnpzq :“ PpSn “ z | S0 “ 0q
for n P N0 “ t0u Y N , z P Z2 .

(see also [CSZ19a, Proposition 3.2] for a refined asymptotic behavior).
The environment (disorder) is given by a family pωpn, zqqnPN,zPZ2 of i.i.d. random variables
satisfying the assumptions in (1.2). Note that λpβq :“ log Ereβωs „ 1

Given φ, ψ : Z2 Ñ R, polymer length N P N, and inverse temperature (or disorder
strength) β ě 0, we define the averaged directed polymer partition function as follows:

When ψ ” 1, we will simplify notation and write Zβ

Remark 1.6. To comply with the periodicity of the simple random walk, we usually consider
φ supported on the even sub-lattice
Z2
