ANALYTICAL DERIVATION OF EQ. (5)
Equation (5) is the average entanglement asymmetry of the U(1)-symmetric Haar random ensemble with respect
to a charge orthogonal to the conserved charge that generates the symmetry of this ensemble. For simplicity, we take
here as conserved charge Qz = PL
j=1 σz
j and as orthogonal charge Qx = PL
j=1 σx
j . Since by construction any state
in the ensemble commutes with Qz, which is the charge generating the rotations along the z−axis, we have that the
asymmetry for Qx is the same as that for Qy. Therefore, we also have that, on average, E[∆S(2)|Qx] = E[∆S(2)|Qy].
From now on, and for simplicity, we consider as conserved charge Q′
z = 1
2(Qz + L) such that the eigenvalues are
integers q′ = 0, 1, 2, . . . , L. This will not modify our final result: the asymmetry is invariant under this change since
the projectors in the eigenspaces of Q′
z and Qz are the same. Let us take a state |Ψ(M)⟩belonging to the ensemble
of U(1)-symmetric Haar random states with fixed total charge Q′
z |Ψ(M)⟩= M |Ψ(M)⟩. We divide the full system
in a subsystem A of ℓA sites and the complement B with L −ℓA sites. To compute the asymmetry of the reduced
density matrix ρA = Tr(|Ψ(M)⟩⟨Ψ(M)|) with respect to Qx, we need to calculate its symmetrization,
ρA,Qx =
X
k
Π(x)
k ρAΠ(x)
k ,
(sm-1)
where Π(α)
q
is the projector onto the eigenspace of with eigenvalue q of Qx,A, i.e. the restriction to A of Qx. To
enlighten the notation, we omit in the projectors the subscript A indicating that they act on the Hilbert space HA.
To exploit the symmetry properties of ρA, we find convenient to write the projectors Π(x)
q
in terms of the projectors
Π(z)
q
of the conserved charge. Due to the algebra of Pauli matrices, they are simply related by
Π(x)
k
= U†Π(z)
k U,
(sm-2)
where U ≡exp(iπQy,A/4). Combining Eqs. (sm-1) and (sm-2), the second moment of the symmetrized density matrix
is then
Tr[ρ2
A,Qx] =
X
k
Tr[U†Π(z)
k UρAU†Π(z)
k UρA].
(sm-3)
The next step is to write the operator U†Π(z)
k U in the basis of the eigenstates {|qm⟩} of Q′
z,A as follows
U†Π(z)
k U =
X

A(k)mm′

|qm⟩⟨q′m′| .
(sm-4)
The state |qm⟩satisfies Q′
z,A |qm⟩= q |qm⟩and m labels the degenerate states in the eigenspace with eigenvalue q.
The coefficients A(k)mm′
qq′
are defined as
A(k)mm′
