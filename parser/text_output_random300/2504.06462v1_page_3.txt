where Cw, Cg, Sv refer to the domains of the induced currents
on the impedance sheets, ground plane and dielectric, respec-
tively. In addition, k is the free-space wavenumber, η ≈377Ω
is the free-space impedance, H(2)
0
is the second-kind Hankel
function of zeroth order, and ρ = yˆy + zˆz, ρ′ = y′ˆy + z′ˆz
are the position vectors of the observation and source points,
respectively.
The total ﬁeld, which is x-polarized, should be zero on
the ground plane based on the boundary conditions, since the
latter is considered a perfect electric conductor. Moreover, the
impedance boundary condition, formulated by Leontovich and
Shchulkin [31], requires that the ratio of the total electric ﬁeld
to the induced current density is Zn at the n-the impedance
strip [32]. Lastly, the polarization current is written as a func-
tion of the total electric ﬁeld through the dielectric constant
of the substrate. In summary, the total electric ﬁeld satisﬁes:

where ω is the angular frequency of operation and Z(y)
comprises the surface impedance values Zn at the location
of each impedance strip. Equations (1)-(2) deﬁne a system of
volume-surface integral equations (VSIE) with respect to the
unknown current densities.
The VSIE are solved with a Method of Moments (MoM)
approach. Speciﬁcally, the surface current densities Jw(y)
and Jg(y) are expanded to Nw and Ng 1-D pulse basis
functions extending along the impedance sheets and ground
plane, respectively. Moreover, a total of Nv 2-D pulse basis
functions are utilized for the expansion of the volumetric
current density Jv(y, z). At each one of these basis functions
the current is assumed constant with an unknown complex
amplitude. By performing testing at the center of each basis
function domain (point matching), a linear system of equations
can be obtained with (Nw+Ng+Nv) equations and unknowns,
which can be written in a block-matrix format as follows:

In Eq. (3), the vectors ¯Ji and ¯Einc
i
(i = {w, g, v} contain
the unknown complex amplitudes of the current densities and
the sampled incident ﬁeld values, respectively, at the center of
each basis function domain. The matrix P is diagonal with
all elements being equal to 1/[jω(εr −1)ε0], whereas the
matrix Zw is also diagonal and contains the surface impedance
values corresponding to the location of each basis function
along the impedance strips. Lastly, the matrices Gij represent
the self and mutual impedances with their elements Gij[n][m]
calculated analytically [23].
By solving the linear system in Eq. (3), the induced current
densities are calculated for a given incident ﬁeld and set of
surface impedances Zn. Then, the far-ﬁeld radiation can be
computed at a number of equally-spaced discrete angles θn
in the yz plane. By convention, we assume positive angles
(θn > 0) for angles in the half-space with y > 0, and negative
angles (θn > 0) for the half-space with y < 0. The ﬁeld
pattern is obtained from the sampled current densities as:
¯Eff =

where | ¯Eff| is a vector containing the ﬁeld pattern values in
the discretized angles θn (the phase of ¯Eff is disregarded, as
the focus is on the amplitude of the pattern), and the elements
of the Gfi matrices are given as:
• i = {g, w},

where the coordinates (ym, zm) are the centers of the m-th
current basis function. The radiation intensity is calculated at
each angle θn as U(θn) = |Eff(θn)|2/(2η). Then, the 2-D
directivity (referring to the yz cross-section) at each angle is
given as:
D(θn) = 2π U(θn)

where the radiated power Prad is found through a numerical
integration of the radiation intensity:

U(θ)dθ.

Equations (4)-(7) are used to calculate the directivity in the
far-ﬁeld. However, measurements in the used bi-static mea-
surement setup are taken in a ﬁnite radius rd. Since a small
difference in the pattern may exist, it may be beneﬁcial to
calculate the exact ﬁeld without applying any far-ﬁeld approx-
imation. For each angle θn, the total ﬁeld Enf is calculated
at the points (y, z) = (rdsin(θn), rdcos(θn)) by multiplying
the weights ¯Ji with the respective Green’s functions. The
radiation intensity is then calculated at this “near-ﬁeld” radius
as U(rd, θn) = r2
d|Enf(θn)|2/(2η). Naturally, as rd →∞,
the calculation of the directivity at the radius rd converges to
the far-ﬁeld calculation.
C. Optimization of surface impedances
The analysis framework described above can be supple-
mented with an optimization technique to determine the sur-
face impedances Zn that shape the reﬂections from the RIS
into a desired far-ﬁeld pattern. The optimization variables are
the imaginary parts of the surface impedances Xn, with the
real parts Rn(Xn) added based on a lookup table for the
