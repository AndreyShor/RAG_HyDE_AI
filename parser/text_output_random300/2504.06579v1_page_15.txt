the z-axis, the underlying Hamiltonian can be brought to the time-independent structure of
Eq. (7), and we can analytically carry out an identical treatment of the underlying Rabi
oscillations [25]. It would be an interesting poser to address the question of what transpires
when a pulse sequence of the kind studied in this work (with the average frequency of
application of pulses being λ) is introduced in the rotating frame, which would naturally
connect the problem to considerations of relaxation phenomena in magnetic resonance. While
in the magnetic resonance context, the frequency ω in Eq. (50) must be matched with
the Zeeman frequency associated with the static field B in order to achieve the resonance
condition, we would however be interested in a more general situation in which the frequency
ω can be arbitrary. We would then, in principle, be able to map the entire domain of the
interplay of ω and λ. If there is no decoherence (i.e., λ = 0), there is the intriguing occurrence
of a Berry phase, and it would be interesting to explore how presence of λ disrupts this
additional quantum phase [30]. Furthermore, there is also the emergence of a separate and
fascinating Kapitza phenomenon when ω is arbitrarily large and the underlying spin feels an
effective static field [31]. We would like to examine how the pulse sequencing tampers with
the Kapitza limit. However, the frequency-dependent case is a separate one and is relegated
to a future study.
