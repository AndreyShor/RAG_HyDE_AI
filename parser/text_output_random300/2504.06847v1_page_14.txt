spectrum of (2-Amp)2SO4H2O can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of NH groups 
involved in the hydrogen bonds of the N-H...O type (donor-acceptor distances of 2.637(1)-
2.983(1) Å). The bands related to the stretching modes of OH groups participating in O-H…O 
hydrogen bonds (donor-acceptor distances of 2.733(1)-2.796(1) Å) appear in the 3400-3100 
cm-1 region. 
 
3.3.2. Vibrational bands associated with 2-Amp(1+) cation 
 
The IR spectra of the studied salts exhibit, in addition to strong to medium-intensity bands 
of stretching vibrations of NHx groups participating in hydrogen bonds (see Chapter 3.3.1.), 
several characteristic manifestations of 2-Amp(1+) cations. The maxima of strong bands 
related to mixed modes of C-NH2, rg, NHx and rg vibrations were recorded in the 1690-
1645 cm−1 region. The manifestations of mixed rg, NHx and CH vibrations appear as strong 
bands with maxima in the 1642-1624 cm−1 region. The strong to medium-intensity bands 
associated with mixed modes of CH rg and NH vibrations were located in the 1371-1344 
cm−1 region.  The maxima of bands related to mixed bending CH and stretching rg vibrations 
were observed in the 1228-1199 cm−1 region, and the maxima related to bending rg vibrations 
in the 578-575 cm−1 region. 
 
The manifestations of stretching C-H modes were recorded in the Raman spectra in the 
region ranging from 3130 to 3020 cm−1. The maxima of the other characteristic bands (medium 
to strong intensity) are located in the 1645-1625 cm−1 region (mixed modes of rg, NHx and 
CH vibrations) and 1556-1541 cm−1 region (mixed modes of rg, CH, NHx and NCN 
vibrations). The maxima of the bands related to mixed CH and rg vibrations were observed 
in the 1230-1198 cm−1 region. Very strong bands recorded in Raman spectra in the 890-870 
cm−1 region represent manifestations of mixed C-NH2, rg, NHx and rg vibrations. The 
bands with the maxima located in the 584-579 cm−1 region belong to characteristic rg 
vibrations. 
 For the assignment of the remaining 2-Amp(1+) cation vibrational bands in the studied salts,

3.3.3. Vibrational bands associated with anions 
 
The correlation diagrams concerning the internal modes of anions and their labelling for 2-
AmpH2PO3, both polymorphs of 2-AmpHSO4 and (2-Amp)2SO4H2O are presented in Tables 
S14-S16 (Supplementary material).
