The reduced K group eK(M5) ∼= Z ⊕Z2
2 reflects the presence of a Chern number and two Z2-invariants.
These
invariants can be expressed as:
Ch = 1

ν(2)

Here, the 2D sub-manifolds X1,2, M and the oriented segments S+
1,2 are illustrated in Fig. S5(b). The two boundaries
S±
1 of X1 are oriented segments along the kx-direction, which are transformed onto each other by the screw rotation
symmetry R2. Thus, X1 has the topology of a Klein bottle, and therefore ν(2)
1
is well-defined. A similar argument
holds for X2 and ν(2)
2 .
There are several alternative ways to define the Z2 invariants, all of which are equivalent to the definition presented
here. These alternative definitions will be introduced in the next section.
Moreover, since R2 does not change the orientation of the kx-ky plane, a Chern number is well-defined over this
plane.

Tricosm M6
The momentum space Bieberbach group corresponding to the tricosm is P31. We assume the action of the point
group C3 = {E, R3, R2

R3 : (kx, ky, kz) →

The reduced K group eK(M6) of tricosm is isomorphic to Z3 ⊕Z. The invariants can be defined as:

Here, the cylinders X1, X2 and the oriented segment S−
1 are illustrated in Fig. S5(c). This is the case introduced in
the main text. The boundary ∂Xi consists of two oriented components S±

with i = 1, 2, 3, and the screw rotation
maps S+
i to S+
i+1 with i mod 3, i.e.,
∂Xi = S+
