interaction between the two mechanical resonators of S 1 and
S 2 can be described by adding to the full Hamiltonian of the
system a quadratic interaction term
V = ℏλ(b†
1 + b1)(b†
2 + b2),
(9)
where λ represents the gravitational coupling rate. This model
is a good approximation for a linearized Newtonian force,
where the specific value of λ originates from the Taylor ex-
pansion of the gravitational potential energy of the mechan-
ical modes and depends on the specific geometric configu-
ration. For example, as discussed in Supplemental Material
S.III, λ = Gm/(d3ωB) for two spheres of mass m whose cen-
ters are at an average distance d.
The full Hamiltonian H = H1 + H2 + V can be further sim-
plified in the so-called rotating-wave approximation (RWA).
In this work, we are interested in enhancing state-transfer in-
teractions [14, 15], so we focus on the resonance condition
∆= ωB and move to an interaction picture with respect to
H0 = ℏωB(a†
jaj + b†
jbj) such that, after neglecting all terms
rotating at frequency ±2ωB (RWA), we are left with a passive
interaction Hamiltonian:
HI = ℏg(a1b†
1 + a†
1b1 + a2b†
2 + a†
2b2) + ℏλ(b1b†
2 + b†
2b1). (10)
The above Hamiltonian represents a chain of 4 bosonic modes
in which excitations (and therefore quantum information) can
coherently hop from one mode to a nearest-neighbor in the
chain. Taking into account dissipation and thermal noise, we
obtain the following set of quantum Langevin equations [14,
15, 37]:
da j(t)
dt
= −κ
2aj(t) −igbj(t) + √κain j(t),
(11)
db j(t)
dt
= −γ
2b j(t) −igaj(t) −iλb3−j(t) + √γbin j(t),
where j ∈{1, 2}, κ and γ are the optical and mechanical damp-
ing rates respectively, ain j and binj are the optical and mechan-
ical noise operators already introduced in Eqs. (2) and (3).
We move to the frequency domain where the Langevin
equations (11) can be easily solved by linear algebra (see Sup-
plemental Material S.I). Combining the solution of (11) with
Eq. (4), we can express the output operator of the second cav-
ity as a linear combination of the four input operators. In par-
ticular, identifying the term proportional to ain1(ω) as the input
“signal”, the GIT channel from ain1(ω) to aout2(ω) can be writ-
ten as a phase-insensitive thermal attenuator [19, 20],
aout2(ω) =
p
η(ω)eiφ(ω)ain1(ω) +
p
1 −η(ω)aE(ω),
(12)
where the transmissivity η(ω) and the phase factor φ(ω) can
be analytically computed (see Supplemental Material S.I for
explicit expressions). In Eq. (12), we collected the noise terms
proportional to bin1(ω), bin2(ω), and ain2(ω), into an single
environmental mode aE(ω). The quantum state of aE(ω) is
a thermal state with ⟨aE(ω)⟩= 0 and ⟨[aE(ω)]†aE(ω′)⟩=
N(ω)δ(ω −ω′), where the mean occupation number N(ω) can
be analytically computed and represents the effective thermal
noise of the attenuator channel. The non-classicality of the

eter space (ωB, Q = ωB/γ), according to Eq. (13) and Eqs. (5-7).
We assume the mechanical degrees of freedom are two nearby gold
spheres at a temperature of T = 1 mK, such that λ ≃πGρAu/(6ωB),
where ρAu is the gold mass density. See Supplemental Material S.III
for more details. The transmissivity η of the effective channel is ≈1
in the low-frequency region, but it is extremely small (≲10−23) in
the high-frequency region. This fact makes the high-frequency re-
gion theoretically valid but experimentally problematic. The red star
corresponds to the parameters of Fig. 1.
quantum channel is completely determined by η(ω) and N(ω)
and is independent from the phase factor eiφ(ω).
Replacing the analytic solutions for η(ω) and N(ω) in
Eq. (8) and optimizing over ω and g (see Supplemental Ma-
terial S.I for explicit calculations), we find that the maximum
ratio is achieved at ωopt = 0 1 and gopt := ( √κ/2)(γ2 +4λ2)1/4,
where Eq. (8) reduces to
A ⇔B ⇔C ⇔λ2 > γ2NT(NT + 1),
(13)
corresponding to a thermal attenuator with:
ηopt =
2λ2/γ2

Nopt = NT.

We observe that, within the range of validity of the RWA (see
App. S.I D), the optimized gravity-induced channel is inde-
pendent of the cavity decay rate κ, and its effective temper-
ature reduces to the real temperature of the mechanical res-
onators. The analytic expression in Eq. (13) determines a sim-
ple requirement for testing the non-classicality of gravity in
terms of only three parameters (λ, γ and NT), providing a clear
figure of merit in the search for the optimal parameter regions
as shown in Fig. 2. In principle, the condition in Eq. (13) is the
only fundamental requirement imposed by quantum mechan-
ics. However, in a real experiment, one must consider further
technical constraints such as ensuring reasonable values for
the time duration of the experiment and for the magnitude of

quency ωA.
