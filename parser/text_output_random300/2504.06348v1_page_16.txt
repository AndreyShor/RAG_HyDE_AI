Figure 2: Total Toffoli gate cost for all problem instances in Table 1 as a function of time (in atomic units, the
unit time step is ℏ/Eh = 2.42×10−17s where Eh is 1 Hartree) for total time-evolution error δ = 10−9. Larger
values of δ may be sufficient for several applications but does not decrease the resource costs substantially
for the studied time regimes.

Hamiltonians in plane-wave basis
3.1
Electrons and nuclei
In this section, we define notation and derive the full Hamiltonian describing electrons and nuclei in the
plane-wave basis, which we shall then modify in Sec. 3.2 to include a pseudoion description. Let |r⟩i, |R⟩I be
the position eigenstates of electron i = 1, . . . , ηel and ion I = 1, . . . , ηion, respectively, labeled by the position
operators eigenvalues r, R. Define the finite periodic plane wave basis,

for electron and ion i, I, respectively.
The integral is over the real-space simulation cell defined by the
real-space lattice vectors {aα}3
α=1. The volume of the simulation cell is
Ω= | det(A)| = |a1 · (a2 × a3)|,
(16)
where A is a matrix with columns {aα}3
α=1. Note that we label the electronic momentum eigenstates by
integers p = (p1, p2, p3), where each pα ∈Z (for α = 1, 2, 3) lives in the set
Gα := [−pmax
