• Relative Error| Strict: Only 4 solutions passed the strict cut, i.e. computed a valid
target AND a relative error of less than 10%. The mean relative error over this
subset is 2.15% ± 1.89%.
Over the larger set of 11 problems for which any solution was computed, the mean relative
error is 296% ± 200%, where the error bars denote the standard error on the mean.
In Python, and particularly with popular ‘in-distribution’ packages like numpy and scipy,
the difficulty of generating syntactically correct code is minimal. However, now the LLM
must define and implement the equations describing the physics and the mesh from scratch
and configure its own solver settings as it can no longer import pre-verified physics modules
and automatic solvers as in the engineering simulation software. Thus the bottleneck has
now shifted from generating executable code, to being able to achieve the desired numerical
precision, since in only 4 cases the LLM was able to compute a value within 10% of the
desired target. The emergence of commercial softwares like COMSOL Multiphysics®,
Ansys®(Ansys, Inc.) and Abaqus®FEA (Dassault Syst`emes) arose from the challenge of
solving complex engineering problems with general purpose languages, and to fulfil the
need for already validated physics modules, numerical precision and automatic solvers.

You are an experienced COMSOL engineer. You must solve the problem to compute
the desired TARGET QUANTITY by generating COMSOL JAVA API code. The
model creation line “‘Model model = ModelUtil.create(”Model”);”’ has already been
generated and you should not repeat this line. All lines of code must begin with
‘model.‘
You must not generate any ‘model.sol...‘ solver code but should ensure that your
‘model.study...‘ block ends with a ‘model.study(”std1”).run();‘. This will automati-
cally create and run the default solver for the problem. Use the example provided
below to infer how to format your response and generate COMSOL code. ===

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: ## Stress Analysis of an Elliptic Membrane
**ANALYSIS TYPE:**
* Linear elastic, Plane Stress.
**GEOMETRY:**
* The domain is a quarter of an elliptical membrane.
* The outer curved edge is defined by the equation: (x/3.25)2 + (y/2.75)2 = 1
* The inner curved edge is defined by the equation: (x/2)2 + y2 = 1
* Thickness: 0.1 meters (uniform throughout)
* Labeled points: * Bottom Left Corner, Point O: (x = 2.0, y= 0)
**LOADING:**
* Uniform outward pressure of 10 MPa is applied on the outer curved edge, normal
to the boundary. * The inner curved edge is unloaded.
**BOUNDARY CONDITIONS:**
* Left Edge: Symmetry about the y-axis, implying zero displacement in the x-
direction. * Bottom Edge: Symmetry about the x-axis, implying zero displacement in
the y-direction.
**MATERIAL PROPERTIES:**
* Isotropic: The material properties are the same in all directions. * Young’s Modulus
(E): 2.1 x 1011 Pa * Poisson’s Ratio (ν): 0.3
**ELEMENT TYPES:**
