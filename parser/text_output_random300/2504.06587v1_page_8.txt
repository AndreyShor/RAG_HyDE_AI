Spectrum Sensing and Signal Recovery
In this section, we evaluate the performance of SigChord in spec-
trum sensing and signal recovery. We compare SigChord with a
Transformer-based SOTA spectrum sensing model WrT [64], the
CS recovery algorithm DTMP [8], and a deep compressed sens-
ing (DCS) recovery algorithm [52]. Firstly, we show the spectrum
sensing performance of SigChord, WrT and DTMP. Since WrT is
designed for Nyquist-rate spectrum sensing only, we adjust its
spectra size and patch size to accommodate sub-Nyquist samples.
Specifically, we reshape and unfold a (𝑃, 2400) complex sample to
(2400, 2𝑃) real sample, and set the spectra size and patch size to
(2400, 2𝑃) and (16, 2𝑃), respectively, corresponding to the folding
factor 𝐹= 16 in SigChord. We implement WrT with 3 Transformer
encoder layers,𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙= 128, 4 attention heads and feeding forward
dimension of 512. The number of parameters of WrT is similar to
that of SigChord. WrT is trained on the synthetic dataset with batch
size of 512 for 100 epochs as well. For the CS recovery algorithm
DTMP, we recover 𝑋with the number of narrowband signals as
the prior information. Apart from the synthetic dataset and over-
the-air dataset, we generate a Gaussian random signal dataset to
validate the generalization of SigChord. Unless otherwise specified,
each random signal contains 6 narrowband signals, each with a
Table 2: Model parameters, memory usage, and inference
time for one batch (size = 1,024, representing data with dura-
tion 49ms). The batch contains 1,340 DVB-S2, 1,416 Non-HT
Wi-Fi, and 1,345 HT Wi-Fi headers. 5 ≤𝑃≤11 denotes the
number of low-speed ADCs.

Results on the synthetic dataset are shown in Figure 11. Let 𝑟
represent the ratio of the total sampling rate to twice the Landau
rate, with 𝑟= 0.5 corresponding to the Landau rate, and 𝑟= 1
marking the sub-Nyquist sampling limit. The cases 𝑟= 0.52 and
𝑟= 0.83 correspond to 𝑃= 5 and 𝑃= 8 low-rate ADCs, respectively.
The conventional compressed sensing algorithm, DTMP, struggles
to reliably detect signals when 𝑟< 1, particularly as 𝑟= 0.52 nears
the Landau rate, where its performance deteriorates sharply. In con-
trast, both Transformer-based deep learning models, SigChord and
WrT, accurately perform spectrum sensing at 𝑟< 1. Importantly,
despite WrT having more parameters in our experiments, SigChord
outperforms WrT at low SNRs, leveraging its embedding process,
which is specifically tailored for sub-Nyquist sampling inputs.
By adjusting the threshold 𝜃, Figure 12 shows the ROC curves of
SigChord and WrT at sampling rates below the sub-Nyquist limit,
evaluated on unseen over-the-air signals and random Gaussian
signals. SigChord and WrT generalize well to over-the-air datasets,
showing minimal errors under favorable SNR that could achieve per-
fect detection and zero false alarms. For the random signal dataset,
where data distributions differ significantly from the training data,
SigChord consistently outperforms WrT. Its ROC curves are closer
to the top-left corner, reflecting superior accuracy. Notably, Sig-
Chord achieves comparable performance at 𝑟= 0.5 with dense
spectra containing 8 signals, while WrT requires 𝑟= 0.67 to handle
only 6 signals. Furthermore, even at an extremely low sampling rate
below the Landau rate (𝑟= 0.42), SigChord demonstrates robust
performance, maintaining both false alarm and miss detection rates
below 0.1.
Next, We evaluate the signal recovery mean square error (MSE)
of Algorithm 1, DTMP, and DCS across various sampling rates.
DCS, which requires seconds to converge even for a single input,
is iterated for 20,000 steps. The reference MSE is calculated by
comparing the noisy Nyquist-rate signal against its noise-free coun-
terpart. SigChord’s robust spectrum sensing ensures Algorithm 1
generalizes effectively to unseen signals. For over-the-air signals
with 𝑟> 0.83 and random Gaussian signals with 𝑟> 0.67, the
recovery MSE aligns closely with the optimal reference, enabling
high-quality non-sparse signal recovery below the sub-Nyquist
limit. In contrast, DTMP suffers significant degradation when 𝑟< 1
