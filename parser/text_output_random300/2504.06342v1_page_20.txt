Figure 10. Projection plots of the X-ray luminosity viewed from the polar (top) and azimuthal (bottom) angles, zoomed
in to a radius of 100 kpc. The X-ray properties of the gas exhibit significant variations with time and viewing angles.
X-ray cavities in size up to 20 kpc and bi-polar bubble structures are visible at certain times, which are caused by past
cold-mode AGN feedback activities.
by high-speed (‚àº104 km) cold winds of the past
AGN activity when the SMBH stays at high accre-
tion rates, as shown in ¬ß3.3.
Two implications can be drawn from the results:
(i) the large-scale X-ray properties, as the gas den-
sities and temperatures, are not directly correlated
with the instantaneous AGN luminosity but rather
reflect the delayed AGN activities; (ii) X-ray cavi-
ties and bubble structures can be produced by past
cold-mode AGN winds, albeit the size of the cav-
ities is smaller than those created by AGN jets in
the hot mode. We also note that the cavities are
transient since the AGN active fraction is only a
few percent (see ¬ß3.5). We suspect that it might be
challenging to both detect these cavities produced
by cold AGN winds due to their small sizes and
short lifetimes, and to distinguish them from those
produced by AGN jets in the hot mode. At low ac-
cretion rates (ùë°= 302 Myr and 902 Myr), the X-ray
properties are less aspherical. At ùë°= 414 Myr, al-
though the AGN luminosity is high at ‚àº0.02 ùêøEdd,
the spherical distribution of X-ray is also main-
tained, since the cold AGN winds just begin to
launch (the cold wind is just visible at the very cen-
ter in Fig. 10) and have not yet influenced the large-
scale X-ray properties.
Future X-ray missions,
such as XRISM (XRISM Science Team 2020) and
HUBS (Cui et al. 2020; Bregman et al. 2023), may
provide valuable insights into the X-ray properties
of the gas in galaxies and the impact of AGN feed-
back on the circumgalactic medium.
4. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
4.1. Conclusions
We present the first results from the MACER3D
framework, a new suite of three-dimensional hydro-
dynamic simulations of galaxy evolution featuring
self-consistent two-mode AGN feedback and sub-
stantially enhanced gas physics and subgrid models
compared to its MACER2D predecessor. Key im-
provements include a spatially-resolved SN feed-
back model with Poisson-distributed events, an ex-
act integration scheme for gas heating and cool-
ing, and a comprehensive metal enrichment model
with spatially-resolved production, as detailed in
¬ß2. The simulations span a broad dynamical range
from the fully-resolved vicinity of the Bondi radius
(25 pc) to galactic halo scales (‚àº250 kpc), evolv-
ing over Gyr timescales. This extensive coverage
proves crucial for accurately treating both small-
scale accretion flows, which determine BH growth
and AGN feedback modes, and capturing the long-
