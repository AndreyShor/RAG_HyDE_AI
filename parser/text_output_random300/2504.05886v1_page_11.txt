spreading strategy does improve the A population, but
the other mixed strategies again revert to pure evasion.

Interpretation of learned strategies
We discuss the results of Fig. 7 and Tab. III. We first
compare the symmetric case (A behaves identically to
B, C) with the non-directional case (σA, λA are optimised
but particles have no directional preferences) and we fo-
cus on the sparse situation (pω = 0.015). Tab. III shows
that it is desirable for A to move faster than the other
species (λA > 1) but consume less prey (σA < 1). We ex-
plain below (Sec. VI) that this reduced σA results in more
hungry particles and hence reduced reproduction rate,
but this apparent reduction in fitness is counteracted by
the “survival of the weakest” effect [6, 10, 36, 53, 81],
which is typical for systems with cyclic dominance. The
key insight is that reduced predation by A enhances the
population of species B, and this species in turn predates
on C, reducing their population. Recalling that C acts in
turn as a predator for A, this effect tends to also enhance
ρA. This effect is apparent throughout Fig. 7 because the
optimised parameters always lead to reduced C popula-
tions, reducing the amount of predation on species A.
Comparing symmetric and non-directional strategies
for the crowded case, the optimal parameters now have
strongly reduced σA, which again facilitates survival of
the weakest. (In this situation, the optimal λA is reduced
with respect to the other species, which is opposite to the
sparse case.)
Turning to pure directional strategies, there is a sig-
nificant improvement over non-directional strategies in
the sparse case, with both evasion and spreading prov-
ing effective. (Recall that evasion corresponds to mov-
ing away from predators, while spreading corresponds to
moving into empty space.) The survival-of-the-weakest
effect hints that predation plays an important role in de-
termining A’s population, so it is not surprising that eva-
sion of predators is also effective. The role of spreading
is not so clear-cut but we recall that particles can only
reproduce if empty space is available, so this strategy
naturally increases the net rate of reproduction. In the
crowded case, the evasion strategy provides a marginal
benefit, although the population of the predator (C) be-
comes very low. If the C dies out then the ecosystem will
collapse: we do observe that the A population has quite
large fluctuations, indicated by the error bar in Fig. 7,
see also Sec. VI, below.
Note that the strategy of hunting prey is never ef-
fective: optimal strategies always have ϕH = 0.
This
can also be rationalised via survival of the weakest since
hunting prey reduces the B population, which allows the
predator population C to grow, eventually harming A.
The clustering strategy (movement of A particles towards
others of the same species) has no benefit in the sparse
case but does have a positive effect in the crowded case.
This is likely due to A particles shielding each other from
predators (there is at most one particle per site so a high
local density of A’s tends to reduce the density of C’s).
As noted above, survival-of-the-weakest achieves a
large A population by suppressing their predators
(species C): however, if the C population falls too low
then a random fluctuation may cause them to die out, in
which case the ecosystem collapses and all species become
extinct. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 9 which shows
