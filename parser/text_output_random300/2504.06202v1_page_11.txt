Figure 3.1: Exploration process 1. The red curve is ℓ([0, t1]). The brown curve is bγ.
Let eγ := f(γ \ bγ). Let E2 be the event that eγ intersects ∂Bε/4. If both E1 and E2 hold, then

(3.3)
Conditionally on Σ, eγ is a chordal SLEκ in H between f(a) and f(b). We first apply the conformal
map h : z 7→(z −f(b))/(z −f(a)) to eγ. Since h(0) = f(b)/f(a) and h′(0) = (f(b) −f(a))/f(a)2,
we can deduce by Proposition 2.3 that
P[E2 | Σ] ≍

(3.5)
The fact that (3.5) is positive follows from the observations that E1 is an event with positive
probability, and that on E1, the quantity (f(b)−f(a))/(f(a)f(b)) is a.s. positive. On the other hand,
if (3.5) was infinite, then by (3.3) we would have P
A+
2 (ε, r)
 = ∞for all ε small enough, which is
impossible. Combining (3.3), (3.4), (3.5), we can deduce the lower bound P

2 (κ).
Let E3 be the event that eγ intersects ∂B4ε. On the event A+
2 (ε, r) ∩G+(ε, r), both E1 and E3
hold. Therefore,
P
A+
2 (ε, r) ∩G+(ε, r)
 ≤P[E1 ∩E3] = E[P[E3 | Σ]1E1].
Similarly to (3.4), we have
P[E3 | Σ] ≍
f(b) −f(a)
f(a)f(b)

Combined with (3.5), we can also get the upper bound

(3.6)
By Lemma 3.3, this further implies the upper bound P

 ≲εξ+

for the boundary case.
