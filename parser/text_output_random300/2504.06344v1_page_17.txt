Noting that by (A.6) that the integral (of ΦΦ∗) is nonzero, this fixes CC′

= 0 for all
C′. Thus, we have W(0)k×ℓ
µ
= 0. Then, the remainder of the O(λ) equation for S(1) in (3.3)
gives
2πℓ¯∂S(1)ωIk + ¯∂S(1)k = 0 .
(3.5)
The solution of this equation, again, is a constant, which can be set to zero without loss of
generality since any constant solution can be incorporated into S(0)k, as per (3.2).
Having solved (2.18) to O(λ0) for W and to O(λ) for S, we have determined that the
solutions have the form:
Wk×ℓ

(x) = 0 + λW(1)k×ℓ

(3.6)
with S(0)

from (3.2).
Higher orders, O(λa), a ≥1:
We now continue and substitute (3.6) in (2.18) giving the equations to O(λ) for W and
to O(λ2) for S as follows:
¯ˆDW(1)k×ℓ= 0 ,
2πℓ¯∂S(2)ωIk + ¯∂S(2)k = 0 .
(3.7)
The solution of the second equation, to O(λ2) for S(2), is a constant, which, again, can be
absorbed in S(0). Most importantly, we have found that, due to (3.6), the r.h.s. of the O(λ)
equation for W vanishes. Thus, the equation for W(1) k×ℓhas a solution identical to the one
for W(0) k×ℓfound in (3.1), with new arbitrary constants CC′
2,4. Now, one can invoke the O(λ3)
equation for S in (2.18) to find that both of these constants must be set to zero. Then, one
finds that S(3) obeys the same equation as S(2) (3.7) (and S(1) (3.5)), giving only the constant
solution readily absorbed into (3.2).
We assure the reader that this inductive procedure continues to all orders in the nonlinearity
λ. One finds that at each order in λ, the equation for W(a) has vanishing r.h.s., determined
upon solving the lower-order equations, which set W(0) = W(1) = ... = W(a−1) = 0 (this is
sufficient for the vanishing of the r.h.s. of the ¯DW(a) k×ℓequation in (2.18)). After this, the
equation for S(a+1) sets the lower-order W(a) k×ℓ= 0 and gives only the constant S(a+1) solu-
tion, absorbable into eqn. (3.2) (explicitly presenting this straightforward inductive argument,
however, is increasingly messy and we skip it for brevity).
In conclusion, induction shows that the compact 4gcd(k, r) = 4r moduli ϕC′
µ obeying (2.10)
are the only self-dual perturbations on the top of the abelian solution. We now show that
this conclusion is corroborated by the “exact” numerical solution.
