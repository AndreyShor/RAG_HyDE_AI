Figure 2.14: The NLO and NNLO NNPDF4.0 PDFs with and without MHOUs at Q = 100 GeV. We display
the gluon, singlet, and valence PDFs. All curves are normalized to the NNLO with MHOUs. The bands
correspond to one sigma uncertainty.
MHOUs is generally moderate at NNLO; at NLO it is significant for the gluon and singlet, but
quite moderate for all other PDF combinations.
Inspection of Fig. 2.15 shows that the PDF uncertainty at NNLO in the data region remains
on average unchanged upon inclusion of MHOUs, though in the singlet sector it increases at
small x, especially for the gluon where the increase is up to x ∼10−2. At NLO the uncertainty is
generally reduced in the non-singlet sector, while in the singlet sector the uncertainty increases
for all x, especially for the gluon. This is consistent with the observation of that at NLO the
MHOU from scale variation does not fully account for the large shift from NLO to NNLO for
some datasets.
The somewhat counter-intuitive fact that the uncertainty on the PDF does not increase and
may even be reduced upon inclusion of an extra source of uncertainty in the χ2 was already
observed in Refs. [150, 228] and demonstrates the increased compatibility of the data due to
the MHOU.
