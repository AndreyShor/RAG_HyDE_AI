The necessary modiﬁcation in the case N = 2 has ﬁrst been explained in [15] and the argument
directly generalizes to arbitrary N.
Finally, we can use the Castelnuovo vanishing property, which states that for a given
degree d ∈N there exists a maximal genus gmax(d) such that nd,p
g
= 0 if g > gmax(d). The
existence of such a bound in the unreﬁned case has been proven, using the relation with
Gromov-Witten invariants, in [59]. On the other hand, concrete bounds for some geometries,
again in the unreﬁned case, have been proven in [10, 60]. Instead of using a concrete bound, we
will make the common simplifying assumption that if for some (d, p, g) we ﬁnd that nd,p
g
= 0,
then nd,p
g′ = 0 for all g′ > g.

Almost generic nodal quintics with Z2-torsion
In this section we use conifold transitions, as described in Section 2.2, to construct almost
generic quintic Calabi-Yau threefolds X1 and X2 that respectively have 54 and 48 isolated
nodal singularities. In both cases the torsion is B(X1) = B(X2) = Z2.
The corresponding geometries b
Xr
1 and b
Xr
2, which are the starting points of the conifold
transitions, are CICY 6675 and CICY 6989 from the classiﬁcation [43, 44]. The corresponding
conﬁguration matrices are

Porteous’ formula
Before discussing the geometries, let us brieﬂy recall some properties of the degeneracy loci
of bundle maps and Porteous’ formula.
Consider vector bundles E, F on a variety V of respective rank e and f and a map
φ : E →F. We denote the vanishing locus of (k+1)×(k+1) minors of a matrix representation
of φ by Mk(φ). The expected codimension of Mk(φ) in V is (e −k)(f −k) and if the actual
