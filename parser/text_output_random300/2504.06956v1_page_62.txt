Proof of Proposition 6.1

Furthermore, it also holds that
P(∃m ∈[0, R]d \ SR,t such that Yχ
t (m) −dt ≥−A) ≤ερχ([0, R]d) ,
where SR,t
def= [e−t/2, R −e−t/2]d.
Now, for λ > 0, we define the following quantities,
E(7.18)
def= E
Z
SR,t
1{m∈Dλ
R }1{Y·(m)∈Sχ(m),A,L

(7.20)
so that, using the fact that {Y·(m) ∈Sχ(m),A,L
t
} ⊆{Yχ
t (m) −dt ≥−A}, we can write
E(7.17) = E(7.18) + E(7.19) + E(7.20) .
Using Lemma 7.6, one can easily verify that that for any ε > 0 and A ≥0, there exists L ≥0
sufficiently large such that for any s ≥0 sufficiently large satisfying (es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N, there
exists T ≥0 sufficiently large such that for any t ≥T and χ : [0, R]d →R satisfying the conditions
in (6.6),
E(7.19) + E(7.20) ≤ερχ([0, R]d) .
Therefore, in what follows we can just focus on the expectation E(7.18) for fixed A, L ≥0.
7.2.3
Localisation near the maximum
For λ > 0, 0 ≤b < t/2, and for any m ∈[0, R]d, recalling the notation introduced in (3.3) and (3.4),
we define the localised versions of the quantities in (7.14) by setting
Gm,bt
def= exp

def= Mm,bt(Yχ
t ) ,
Dλ
m,bt
def= Dλ
m,bt(Yχ
t ) ,
(7.21)
where bt
def= b −t. We also introduce the following quantity
Mm,bt+1,bt
def= Mm,bt+1,bt(Yχ
t ) .
Furthermore, for A ≥0, we define the following event
LA
m,bt
def= {∃y ∈[0, R]d \ Bbt(m) such that Yχ
t (y) −dt ≥−A −λ} .
Roughly speaking, on the complement of the event LA
m,bt, everything happens inside Bbt(m). More
precisely, on the event {Yχ
t (m) −dt ≥−A} and on the complement of LA
m,bt, the maximum of Yχ
t
over [0, R]d must be attained inside Bbt(m). Furthermore, the values of the field Yχ
t at points in
[0, R]d \ Bbt(m), are more than λ away from the supremum of Yχ
t . Consequently, we have that
1{(LA
m,bt)c}
1{m∈Dλ
R }1{Yχ
t (m)−dt≥−A}
|Dλ
R|
= 1{(LA
m,bt)c}
