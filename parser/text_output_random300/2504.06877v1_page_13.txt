Figure 7: (a) Quasitemperature of the resonator as a function of the frequency and
amplitude of the drive. The red color represents a higher temperature compared to
the temperature of the Josephson junction, and the blue color represents a lower one.
(b) Dependence of the resonator decay rate on the drive frequency and amplitude
for the phase bias ϕ0 = 0.
The derivation can be found in Appendix C. In the lowest order with respect to the coupling,
the contribution to the absolute value of the transmission coefficient |S21(ω)|2 is given by the
imaginary part of the retarded Green’s function of the resonator. In Fig. 6 we show the plots of
Im GR
r,0(ω) for different drive frequencies. We observe that, if the ac-Stark-shifted LC-circuit
frequency is resonant with the singularity of the junction admittance, the line shape of the
LC-circuit deviates from a Lorentzian, which results in non-exponential decay and, conse-
quently, non-Markovian dynamics of the electromagnetic field in the circuit. The sharpness
of the non-Lorentzian feature is determined by the Dynes parameter. In the realistic case of
να/∆α ∼10−4, the broadening of the logarithmic singularities of the admittance can be of the
order of ∼10 MHz for an aluminum junction. This circumstance may hinder an experimental
observation of the non-Lorentzian spectrum of the resonator, especially if the decay rate due
to the Cooper pair breaking is lower than this broadening.
In addition to the non-Lorentzian feature, we see that the linewidth of the resonator differs
significantly for drive frequencies on different sides of the resonance. This opens a possibility
to use driven Josephson junctions as tunable dissipative elements similarly to NIS-junction
based QCRs [48–50].

Steady state population
Since the rate of photon-assisted Cooper pair breaking processes which involve absorption or
emission of the resonator photons strongly depends on the drive parameters, a driven Joseph-
son junction may effectively cool or heat the LC-circuit. However, the distribution of the
photons is in principle not thermal and cannot be described with a single well-defined tem-
perature. To quantify the population of incoherent photons in the resonator, we assume that
the probe line has a well-defined temperature Tp. Then, we can calculate the heat flow from
probe line to the resonator averaged the noise realizations and in time over the drive period
〈W(Tp)〉. In the lowest order with respect to the coupling capacitance, it is given by
