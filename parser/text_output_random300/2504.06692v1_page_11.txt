Currently, the collaboration consists of 36 institutes in 18 countries, with 9 additional associate institutes,
and CERN and JINR. Several new institutes have expressed interest in joining the experiment.
The coming months will be crucial in consolidating institutional commitments and aligning
funding strategies with national agency priorities. SHiP’s role as a key component of CERN’s
intensity-frontier programme strengthens the case for broad international support, ensuring that
the experiment can move forward in line with the planned timeline for construction and commis-
sioning.
