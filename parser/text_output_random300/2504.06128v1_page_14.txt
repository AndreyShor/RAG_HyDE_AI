which follows by the polynomial chaos expansion (2.11) noting that terms indexed by distinct
space-time sequences pn1, x1q, . . . , pnk, xkq are orthogonal in L2.

is uniformly bounded in L ď N and N P N when β “ βN
lies in the sub-critical regime (1.26) [CSZ19a]. The next result considers the quasi-critical
regime (1.22) and identifies how the second moment diverges as a function of ϑN in (1.22).
The proof, based on renewal theory, is deferred to Appendix A.
Proposition 2.3 (Second moment of point-to-plane partition function). For β “ βN
in the quasi-critical regime (1.22), uniformly over L P 2N with L ď N, we have
