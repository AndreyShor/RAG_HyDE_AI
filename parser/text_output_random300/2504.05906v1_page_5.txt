the 1st and 30th sites, respectively. The coupling strengths between the chain and the 
leads are 𝜏𝑠= 𝜏𝑑= 0.5. The chain is taken to be half-filled, i.e., the total number of 
electrons is 30. The irrational number b is chosen as the golden ratio, given by 𝑏=
(1 + √5) 2
⁄ , and the AAH phase factor is set to 𝜙𝜈= 0. All phonons are assumed to 
have energy ℏ𝜔0 = 0.15. Values of other physical parameters are mentioned at their 
respective places in the text. All energies are measured in units of eV, and the results 
are calculated at 0 K. 
Before analyzing the specific role of disorder, it is essential to first examine the 
characteristic features of the disorder-free conductor, i.e., when the disorder strength 
W=0. Figure 2 presents the energy eigenvalue spectrum for a perfect one-dimensional 
(1D) chain for different sets of electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling 
strengths, u and g. In each case, a vertical line is drawn at every energy eigenvalue, 
with two different colors used to distinguish between the two spin states. 
Figure 2(a) corresponds to the non-interacting situation, while Figures 2(b) and 
2(c) represent the interacting cases. In the non-interacting limit (Fig. 2(a)), the energy 
eigenvalues are uniformly spaced, reflecting the typical linear dispersion of a perfect 
1D chain. In contrast, Fig. 2(b), which includes electron-electron interaction, shows 
the formation of a band gap approximately at the center of the spectrum, accompanied 
by a noticeable shift of the entire band. Under the mean-field (MF) approximation, a 
perfect 1D Hubbard chain with an antiferromagnetic ground state behaves like a bina-
ry (AB-type) lattice. This effective binary structure induces a band gap whose magni-
tude depends on the interaction strength u. Additionally, the shift of the band arises 
from the modification of site energies due to the e-e interaction. 
In Fig. 2(c), both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions are taken into 
account. The presence of the e-ph coupling further enhances the band gap by narrow-
ing the bandwidths on both sides of the spectrum. The additional shifting of the bands 
can again be attributed to the modification of the effective site energies, now incorpo-
rating contributions from phonons as well. 
It is important to note that in all three cases—non-interacting, e-e interacting, and 
combined e-e and e-ph interacting—the eigenvalues for spin-up and spin-down elec-
trons are exactly identical. This outcome stems from the structure of the Hamiltonians 
for the two spin channels. The underlying sublattice symmetry between the spin-up 
and spin-down Hamiltonians ensures that their eigenvalues remain identical, leading 
to a perfect superposition of the spin-up and spin-down bands. 
From this observation, we can infer that under the present conditions, specifically 
in a disorder-free, perfect 1D conductor with the chosen interaction strengths, no spin-
selective phenomena can be realized.
