computed for the same-sign WW channel for definite polarisation [364].
The extraction of
polarisation fractions is expected to be one of the highlights of the run III.

V V ′V ′′
LH21 status:
NLOQCD corrections known for many years [831, 870–876], also in case of
Wγγj [877]; NLOEW corrections with full off-shell effects for WWW production with leptonic de-
cays [878,879]; NLOEW corrections available for the on-shell processes involving three [880–882]
and two [883,884] massive vector bosons; V γγ processes with full leptonic decays calculated at
NLOQCD and NLOEW accuracy [885,886].
While up to now, calculations including the decays of the heavy gauge bosons have focused
on the leptonic channels, several recent computations have considered also the hadronic case.
In Ref. [602], the case of WW(V →jj) has been considered. Beyond the fixed-order results
at full NLOQCD +NLOEW accuracy (i.e. for the EW and QCD production), results for the
matching of QCD corrections to parton shower along with approximate EW corrections have
been presented. Along the same line, full NLOQCD +NLOEW predictions have been presented
for the WZ(V →jj) channel [887]. Interestingly, the NLOEW corrections to the EW production
have been found to be at the level of 14% i.e. twice as large as typical EW corrections for the
triboson production.
In Ref. [888], NLO QCD corrections matched to parton shower have been presented for
the process pp →e+νeµ−¯νµγ. To that end, Herwig is used as the Monte Carlo event generator,
while the amplitudes are tkane from Vbfnlo.
Parton-shower effects are studied in detail.
In particular, the parton-shower corrections can reach 10% in some distributions, potentially
beyond the naive scale variation.
Finally, two-loop QCD amplitudes to Wγγ have been presented [889]. The results are
available in the form of analytical results for the leading colour while they are available only
numerically for the full colour case. In Ref. [125], Nf-contributions at the two-loop level in QCD
have been obtained for a number of processes featuring the production of two and three vector
bosons. These results are relevant for the computation of NNLOQCD for triboson production.
3.3.9
γγ
LH21 status: NNLOQCD corrections known [138, 203, 205, 890, 891]; NLOQCD corrections in-
cluding top-quark mass effects to loop-induced gg channel known [892, 893]; qT resummation
computed at NNLL [890]; NLOEW corrections available [319,894];
NNLL +NNLOQCD accuracy achieved [895] as well as NNLOQCD +PS [896].
While NLOQCD corrections are known for the loop-induced gg channel, the EW ones
are still unknown. In that respect, the main bottleneck is the computation of the two-loop
virtual corrections. A key ingredient for this calculation is the availability of the relevant master
integrals. In Ref. [897], these integrals for the light-quark contributions were obtained.
In Ref. [898], the full top-mass dependence for both the gg and q¯q channels has been
assessed by explicit calculation, relying on the newly obtained two-loop form factors [899]. The
work shows that the effect of top-mass contributions for the full calculation is below 1%.
Finally, Ref. [900] presented a qT resummation at N3LL’ + NNLO QCD accuracy. In addi-
tion to discussing the impact of newly implemented contributions, photon isolation prescriptions
are also studied in this work, and a comparison to ATLAS data at 8 TeV [901] is presented.
