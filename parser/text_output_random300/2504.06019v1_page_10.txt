can define the moist ‘Bretherton’ Rayleigh number (Ram) by setting [L] = H, [B] =
bp(H) −be(H), [t] =
p
[L]/[B], which leads to the expression,
Ram = H3(bp(H) −bE(H))

(24)
The expression of Ram given in equation (24) captures the ratio of conditional insta-
bility (quantified by the buoyancy difference between a parcel and its environment at
z = H) to diffusion. However, the simple buoyancy scale ([B] = bp(H) −bE(H)) does
not account for the curvature of the environmental and buoyancy profiles as shown
in Figure 1. For this reason, we here introduce a non-dimensionalisation based on the
pCAPE of the environment, which provides an alternative (more accurate) measure
of the conditional instability of the environment.

Critical dry Rayleigh number (top left), moist ‘Bretherton’ Rayleigh number (top right), Rainy
number (bottom left) and radiative Rainy Number (bottom right), as a function of the surface temperature
increase and radiative cooling rate. The classical dry Rayleigh number shows variation of a factor of ∼10 at
criticality over the parameter space, while the moist ‘Bretherton’ Rayleigh number varies by a factor of ∼2.75,
the radiative Rainy number varies by a factor of ∼2.03 and the Rainy number varies by a factor of ∼1.75.

pCAPE Non-Dimensionalisation
For a given set of boundary conditions, we first calculate the parcel buoyancy (or
temperature) profile. Based on the environmental buoyancy (or temperature) profile,
