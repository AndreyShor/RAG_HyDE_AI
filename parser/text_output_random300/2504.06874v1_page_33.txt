Supplementary Figure 11. 
Fig. S15. KPFM measurement of device 2 at Vg = 0 V. a, Topography of the tetralayer 
graphene. b, SNOM image of the same area as in (a). Domains with distinct stackings 
are labeled by different symbols in color. At Vg = 0 V, the two polar stackings (indicated 
by triangles) show different near-field optical contrast, since this sample is hole doped 
at Vg = 0 V. The stacking assignments in (b) are also supported by our Raman spectra 
in Fig. 4 of the main text and the KPFM result in (c). The white dashed line depicts the 
boundary between ABCB domain and the ABAB domain. c, KPFM mapping of the 
same area as in (a) and (b) at Vg = 0 V. The ABCA domains are the brightest, meaning 
the lowest work function. For the two adjacent polar stackings, the one that is darker 
(brighter) in SNOM image appears to be brighter (darker) in KPFM, indicative of the 
downward polarization (downward triangle in (b)) and upward polarizations (upward 
triangle in (b)), respectively. The KPFM results of device 2 are consistent with those of 
device 1 (Fig. S6), device 3 (Fig. S13) and device 4 (Fig. S15). The scale bars are all 2 
Âµm.
