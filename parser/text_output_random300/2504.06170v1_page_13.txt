Figure 4. (a) The Galactic longitude-velocity (i.e., l-v) diagram of the 13CO(J = 3–2) data for the integration range in Galactic
latitude = [−0.◦046, 0.◦059]. The contours are drawn at about [6, 12, 18]×σ, where 1σ = 2 mK degree. The velocity gradients
in the eastern and western parts of the filament are indicated by white arrows, and the corresponding velocity gradient values
are provided in the figure in units of km s−1 pc−1. (b) The SCOUSEPY-generated position-position-velocity (PPV; here, l-b-v)
diagram. The data points in the diagram represent the position and centroid velocity of the Gaussian components identified in
the 13CO(J = 3–2) emission. The data points are also colored based on their velocity, according to the color scale shown at
the top of the image. The 13CO(J = 3–2) integrated intensity map is shown in the l-b plane using filled contours at levels [5,
10, 15, 20, 25] K km s−1. The location of the bubble N59-North is highlighted with a red ellipse in the l-b plane. The blue- and
red-shifted velocity components toward N59-North are indicated with arrows.
