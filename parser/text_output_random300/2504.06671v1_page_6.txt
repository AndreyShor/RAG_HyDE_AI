Defect-Based Qubits: 
Defect-based qubits are based on point defects in solid-state materials, where the electronic spin states 
of defects are used to encode information. Examples include the NV center in diamond and VSi or VC-VSi 
centers in SiC. These defects can operate at room temperature, making them attractive for practical 
quantum applications. However, challenges remain in defect creation and control, as well as improving 
coherence times and gate fidelity [9,12,21]. For instance, NV centers in diamond are well-established for 
quantum sensing and communication applications, while SiC is gaining attention for scalable quantum 
computing [8,23].

Spin-Based Qubits: 
Spin-based qubits utilize the spin states of electrons or nuclei in materials like silicon and gallium arsenide 
(GaAs). Quantum dots, such as semiconductor quantum dots made from InAs/GaAs or Si/SiGe systems, 
are also commonly used. The qubit states are represented by spin-up or spin-down orientations. Spin-
based qubits offer long coherence times and are compatible with existing semiconductor technology, 
making them attractive for scalable quantum computing. However, challenges remain in improving 
coupling efficiency and achieving high-fidelity gate operations [35,36]. 
v) 
Topological Qubits: 
Topological qubits are based on anyonic excitations in topologically ordered materials, such as Majorana 
fermions in topological superconductors. Materials under investigation include superconducting 
nanowires made of InAs or MoTeâ‚‚. These qubits are robust to local noise and decoherence due to their 
topological nature, offering the potential for long-lived qubits. However, this platform is still experimental, 
and significant challenges remain in achieving reliable and scalable topological qubit systems [37,38]. 
Table 1 provides a summary the main advantages and challenges for all physical systems mentioned 
above.
