SI-Fig. 27: Local sample stage temperature in B sweep probed with Cernox sensor: a) Cernox tem-
perature R vs. T calibration curve. b) A schematic arrangement of the superconducting magnet, sample
holder, and MC plate inside the dilution fridge. The plane of the sample site on the sample stage is nearly
2 feet away from the MC plate stage. So, the magnetic sweep-induced temperature change is much more
prominent at the device plane compared to the MC plate stage. c) RCernox and d) equivalent sample stage
temperature TCernox. We observe TCernox hysteresis profile analogous to the Rxx hysteresis in TBG.
