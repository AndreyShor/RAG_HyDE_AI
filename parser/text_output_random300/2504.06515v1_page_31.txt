This peculiar behaviour takes place due to the induced momentum-dependent poten-
tial in conjunction with the dual force attraction in the cosmological vacuum. An expansion

illustrates that negative Λe acts effectively as an attractive force leading to bounded (peri-
odic) motions, whereas positive Λe acts effectively as a repulsive force.
For Λe < 0, there can be both bounded and unbounded motion in the electromagnet-
ically repulsive case depending on the size of |q|. For small |q|, cosmological attraction
is smaller, whereas for large |q|, the opposite situation prevails. There is an intermediate
range of |q| for a given Λe, where both bounded and unbounded motions are possible [105].
Sample trajectories are shown in the middle panel of Figure 15.
In the electromagnetically attractive case, for Λe > 0, there can again be both bounded
and unbounded motion depending on the size of |q|. In this case, attraction due to a sufﬁ-
ciently large value of |q| will overwhelm cosmological repulsion. These effects depend on
the relative size of H as compared to
p
κ2m2/2Λe + 4m2; if H is larger than this latter quan-
tity, then there is again an intermediate range of |q| where both bounded and unbounded
motions exist [105]. Sample trajectories are shown in the bottom panel of Figure 15.
Finally, the case of joint electromagnetic and cosmological repulsion yields trajectories
similar to those in Figure 11.

which is symmetric with respect to 1 ↔2 and reduces to the proper time (114) when
m1 = m2.
The parameter space now has an additional variable and the analysis of the various
types of motions is correspondingly more detailed. However, the general rubric of the
four types of motion depending on cosmological attraction/repulsion and electromagnetic
attraction/repulsion continues to hold.
A number of more interesting sample cases are illustrated in Figures 16 and 17. When
m1 is large, m2 behaves like a test body and the two particles oscillate about their centre of
inertia for all values of the parameters shown. The gravitational attraction is stronger and
both the period and proper maximal separation between the particles becomes shorter.
