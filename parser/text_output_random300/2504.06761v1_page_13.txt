Figure 7. Time evolution of the friction Reynolds number in DNS simulations with different initialization
methods. The blue line corresponds to the traditional perturbation method (perturbU), while the black line
represents SWAT. The flow field at the time indicated by the circle on the black line is shown in figure 8.
of Re𝜏= 1000 and a bulk Reynolds number of Re ≈20000, using a grid resolution of
𝑁𝑥× 𝑁𝑦× 𝑁𝑧= 768 × 769 × 768 (Wang & Zaki 2022). The flow is driven by a constant
pressure gradient in the streamwise direction.
To assess the computational efficiency of the synthetic turbulence method, we compare it
to the traditional perturbation initialization ‘perturbU’ (de Villiers 2006), which introduces
perturbations by superimposing a fluctuating velocity field, 𝒖, onto the Poiseuille base flow,
𝑈0. This approach mimics key aspects of the near-wall turbulence cycle, allowing for the
transition to turbulence to occur relatively quickly. However, the effectiveness of this method
depends on the gradual amplification of small perturbations, which can result in a longer
overall transition time.
To quantify the computational cost of achieving fully developed turbulence, we compare
the time-dependent evolution of the Reynolds number in DNSs using both initialization
methods (see figure 7). The perturbU approach initiates turbulence through the progressive
strengthening of initial vortices, which subsequently undergo asymmetric breakdown, en-
hancing turbulent mixing and promoting vortex formation (de Villiers 2006). As turbulence
production intensifies, momentum transfer increases, gradually eroding the parabolic velocity
profile. Eventually, the flow stabilizes into a statistically steady state characterized by a
logarithmic velocity distribution. Despite effectively triggering turbulence, this process is
computationally expensive, requiring more than five flow-through times (FTTs) over 129,000
CPU hours for turbulence to fully develop at the target Re𝜏due to the slow evolution of the
flow structures.
In contrast, the SWAT method for channel flow generates a well-structured turbulence field
from the beginning, featuring meandering low- and high-speed streaks alongside densely
packed hairpin vortex bundles. These structures introduce an appropriate distribution of
turbulent kinetic energy, ensuring that both turbulence characteristics and statistics closely
align with the target Reynolds number early in the evolution. As the flow progresses,
interactions between vortices near the upper and lower walls further enhance the transition
to fully developed turbulence (see figure 8). This transition occurs rapidly and efficiently,
preserving the essential turbulence structures while minimizing computational overhead.
Although there is a slight initial drop in the Reynolds number, it quickly recovers to the
target value within 𝑂(1) FTTs (requiring only 35,800 CPU hours). Furthermore, due to the
well-matched initial statistics provided by SWAT, the mean velocity profiles and Reynolds
stresses converge to their true equilibrium states significantly faster than with the perturbU
approach. By contrast, the traditional perturbation method requires considerably longer to
reach the same level of turbulence development, making SWAT a more efficient alternative
for simulations requiring rapid and reliable turbulence initialization.
