Example 3: Tricosm M6 and Hexacosm M8
One definition of the Z3 invariant for k-space P31 is:
ν(3) = 1

(S81)
where the cylinders Xi and oriented segments S±
i with i = 1, 2, 3 are shown in Fig. S9(a). However, as illustrated in
Fig. S9(b), a similar but different ν(3)′ can be defined as:
ν(3)′ = 1

(S82)
where X′

are obtained by rotating Xi and S±

by 60 degrees. Due to the periodic boundary conditions of
reciprocal space, we can derive that:

If we add ν(3) and ν(3)′, we get:
ν(3) + ν(3)′ = 1

Here, we identify S±
i
related by the 3-fold screw rotation. Thus, there is only one independent Z3 invariant in this
case.
Furthermore, ν(3) and ν(3)′ are also well-defined if the k-space P61 symmetry holds. However, the 6-fold screw
rotation symmetry requires that ν(3) = ν(3)′ mod 3. Along with the identity ν(3) + ν(3)′ = 0 mod 3, this means that
there are no nontrivial Z3 invariants if the k-space P61 symmetry is present.

Two-band Dirac models
We now consider a series of two-band Bloch Hamiltonians of the form Hα = dα(k) · σ which are subject to
corresponding Bieberbach groups. These toy models serve as straightforward examples for investigating topological
phases over Brillouin platycosms.
