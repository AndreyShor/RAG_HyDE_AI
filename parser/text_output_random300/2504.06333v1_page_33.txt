and for which C admits a ﬁber functor. Then, C acts as a resolution of Vec(G,α). In
principle, this will coincide with the group-like case if C = Vec(Γ) and K = Vec(K).
Next, we turn to the details of diﬀerentials and so forth.
Suppose we have a situation as described in Section 2.1, in which a group G
with an anomaly encoded by a cocycle α ∈H3(G,U(1)) is extended by trivially
acting symmetries K to a group Γ,
1 Ð→K Ð→Γ
π
Ð→G Ð→1,
(6.43)
such that the pullback [π∗α] of the anomaly class is trivial in H3(Γ,U(1)), i.e. there
exists a 2-cochain j ∈C2(Γ,U(1)) such that dj = π∗α. We would now like to de-
scribe how this looks from the categorical point of view, where we have a strong
monoidal functor (F,J) from Vec(Γ) to Vec(G,α).
First we recall that the simple objects in Vec(G,α) are labeled by elements
g ∈G and their fusion is given by the group multiplication, g1 ⊗g2 = (g1g2). The
Hom spaces between simple objects Hom(g,h) are either zero4 if g ≠h or are
isomorphic to C if g = h.
In the latter case we have a canonical basis vector
ϕg ∈Hom(g,g). The associators of Vec(G,α), a collection of morphisms ag,h,ℓ∈
Hom((g ⊗h) ⊗ℓ,g ⊗(h ⊗ℓ)), are given in terms of the cocycle α ∈Z3(G,U(1)) as
ag,h,ℓ= α(g,h,ℓ)ϕghℓ.
Now to construct a strong monoidal functor from a tensor category C to another
tensor category D, we need to specify a functor F from C to D, along with a
collection of morphisms JX,Y ∈HomD(F(X) ⊗F(Y ),F(X ⊗Y )) that makes the
following diagram commute,
(F(X) ⊗F(Y )) ⊗F(Z)
F(X) ⊗(F(Y ) ⊗F(Z))
F(X ⊗Y ) ⊗F(Z)
F(X) ⊗F(Y ⊗Z)
F((X ⊗Y ) ⊗Z)
F(X ⊗(Y ⊗Z))
aF (X),F (Y ),F (Z)
JX,Y ⊗idF (Z)
idF (X)⊗JY,Z
JX⊗Y,Z
JX,Y ⊗Z
F (aX,Y,Z)
(6.44)
For the case at hand, we take the functor to act on objects as F(γ) = π(γ),
and to act on morphisms as F(ϕγ) = ϕπ(γ). The morphisms Jγ1,γ2 are constructed
4In fact, when we have a normal subgroup K ⊂Γ that acts trivially, then this is no longer true;
instead the space HomΓ(γ1,γ2) is isomorphic to C whenever γ1γ−1

∈K. This fact is important
in explaining decomposition in such cases, since it is point operators at the end of K lines
(i.e. living in Hom(k,1)) that become the topological point operators heralding decomposition
once we gauge K [6]. However, we don’t need to worry about such extra homomorphisms here
when we construct the strong monoidal structure. If γ1 ≠γ2 then we necessarily have F(ϕ) = 0
for all ϕ ∈Hom(γ1,γ2).
