Abstract
We gain insight on the fixed point dynamics of d dimensional quantum field theories by
exploiting the critical behavior of the d−ϵ sister theories. To this end we first derive a self-
consistent relation between the d −ϵ scaling exponents and the associated d dimensional
beta functions. We then demonstrate that to account for an interacting fixed point in the
original theory the related d −ϵ scaling exponent must be multi-valued in ϵ. We elucidate
our findings by discussing several examples such as the QCD Banks-Zaks infrared fixed
point, QCD at large number of flavors, as well as the O(N) model in four dimensions. For
the latter, we show that although the 1/N corrections prevent the reconstruction of the
renormalization group flow, this is possible when adding the 1/N2 contributions.
