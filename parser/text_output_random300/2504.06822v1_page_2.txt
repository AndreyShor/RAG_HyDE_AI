prior studies utilizing the sum rule method [47], the evaluation of physical quantities, including mass and residue, was limited
to four mass-dimensional operators for both the ground state (1S) and the ﬁrst orbitally excited state (1P) of baryons containing
three heavy quarks with spin-3/2. In order to increase accuracy through the use of contributions from higher-dimensional
nonperturbative operators, we extend our calculations to include nonperturbative terms up to dimension eight for the ground
(1S) state, the ﬁrst orbital excited (1P) state and the ﬁrst radial excited (2S) state. These ﬁndings can be utilized in subsequent
experiments at research facilities, including those at the LHC, to explore various species of heavy baryons.
The structure of this paper is outlined below: Section II presents a detailed formulation of the QCD sum rule technique to
extract the mass spectra and residue values for the triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2 across their ﬁrst three resonances (FTRs),
while Section III presents the outcomes of the numerical evaluation of the sum rules and compares these results with those
reported in the current literature. Section IV provides a brief synopsis and concluding remarks on the investigation. Detailed
expressions derived from the calculations are provided in the Appendix.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
The QCD sum rule method enables the determination of spectroscopic parameters, including mass and residue [70–72]. To
establish the related sum rules for triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2, an appropriate correlation function should be utilized. The
correlation function presented below serves as the starting point for the evaluation in this study

where T denotes the time ordering operator, q is the four-momentum for the triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2, and ηµ is used
to represent interpolating current of these baryons, which can generally be expressed as:
ηµ =

In the above interpolating current expression, Q and Q′ denote the heavy quarks (b or c ), C is charge conjugation operator and
the indices a, b and c denote the color indices of the heavy quark ﬁelds. Table I presents the quark contents for all triply heavy
baryons with spin-3/2, as predicted by the quark model. The primary objective in the QCD sum rule method is to calculate the

two-point correlation function, Eq (1), within two distinct regimes known as the hadronic and QCD sides. At large distances,
within the time-like region of the light cone, the calculated correlation function depends on the hadronic parameters: mass
and residue. This aspect is referred to as the hadronic or physical description of the correlation function. In contrast, the
identical two-point correlation function is analyzed within the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) framework through various
dimensions of the gluon condensates at q2 ≪0, which corresponds to the light cone space-like domain. This computational
scheme includes short-distance effects. This side is commonly referred to as the OPE or QCD representation of the correlation
function. By constructing two representations of a correlation function, we relate them using a dispersion relation and the
quark-hadron duality assumption to formulate the QCD sum rules for the desired physical quantities. Unwanted contributions
from higher states and the continuum are suppressed on both sides by applying Borel transformation and continuum subtraction
operations. The results obtained from both sides include various Lorentz structures. To extract the desired physical parameters,
it is necessary to match the coefﬁcients of the corresponding Lorentz structures.

Hadronic side
On the hadronic side, considering the interpolating current as the operator for creation and annihilation from vacuum, the
studied states are generated or annihilated. To derive this side of the correlation function, the QCD sum rule framework starts
systematically by inserting the two-point correlation function with complete sets of baryonic states in which the quark content
has the same quantum numbers as the interpolating current:
