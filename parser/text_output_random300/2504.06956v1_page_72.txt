0 , and the last inequality follows from [MRV16, Proposition 4.2] applied with χ = log j. Strictly
speaking, we cannot directly apply [MRV16, Proposition 4.2], as the function Fγ is random. However,
by following the proof of that proposition, we obtain the same conclusion in our more general setting
by leveraging assumptions (W1) and (W4). Thus, the conclusion follows, as the series in the last line
of the above display converges to zero as k →∞.
We are now ready to prove Lemma 7.4.
Proof of Lemma 7.4. The claim follows by combining Lemmas 7.11, 7.12, 7.13, and 7.14.
Appendix A
Brownian bridge above a curve
In this appendix, we collect some estimates for the probability of a Brownian bridge staying above a
positive/negative curve, and some “entropic repulsion” estimates. In particular, we are interested in
results analogous to those stated in [BL18, Section 4.2]. We emphasise that in [BL18, Section 4.2],
there are actually estimates for Brownian bridges but are only limited to the case where the underlying
curve is symmetric about the midpoint of the lifespan of the Brownian bridge. Hence, their techniques
for transferring statements about Brownian motion to statements about the Brownian bridge cannot be
applied to our setting. Generally speaking, the proofs of our results are relatively simple adaptations
of the proofs of the results for the Brownian motion in [BL18, Section 4.2].
A.1
Some preliminary results
We collet in this subsection some simple results that are used several times throughout the remaining
part of this appendix. For a continuous function ζ : R+
0 →R, we define the stopping time
τζ
def= inf{s ≥0 : Bs = ζ(s)} .
We recall that for x, u ∈R and b > 0, the law of (Bs)s∈[0,b] under Px,u,b is that of a Brownian bridge
from x to u in time b. We start with some basic facts about Brownian bridges.
Lemma A.1. For b > 0 and x, u > 0, it holds that
Px,u,b(τ0 > b) = 1 −e−2xu
