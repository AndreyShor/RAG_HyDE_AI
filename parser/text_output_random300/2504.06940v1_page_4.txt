Remark II.12. For synthesizer P we have
P |0⟩= |1⟩
(11)
Remark II.13. We have ⟨k|X⟩= √pkX k for k ∈Ω.
Our ultimate goal is to investigate multivariate random variables defined as:
Definition II.14 (Multivariate Random Variable). A multivariate (real) random variable ⃗X of dimension d is a d-
dimension tuple of (real) random variables ⃗X = (X 1, X 2, · · · , X d), each from probability space (Ω, p). As suggested,
for α ∈[d] we would denote the α-th element with superscript X α, and an instance for k ∈Ωof that element X α
k .
Similarly, we can define a multivariate complex random variable and use notation accordingly. There is also the
random variable ⃗1 = (1, 1, · · · , 1).
Lastly, for k ∈Ωan instance of a mulvariate random variable is a vector ⃗Xk = (X 1
k , X 2
k , · · · , X d
k ).
Drawn from physicists’ playbook, we will utilize both superscripts and subscripts for different indices.
Remark II.15 (Index). We will consistently use Greek letters as dimension indices in [d] and put them as superscripts;
conversely, we will use Latin letters as elements from Ωand put them as subscripts.
Here we introduce notations on operations between random variables:
Definition II.16 (Operations on Random Variables). Whenever we have an elementary operation (addition, mul-
tiplication, exponential, trig function, etc) acting on one or two random variables, the outcome is the element-wise
result of such operation on the random variables, with the same dimensions.
Remark II.17 (Example). As examples, we have:
• C = A + B will be a univariate random variable with Ck = Ak + Bk for all outcome k ∈Ω.
• ⃗B = e ⃗A is a univariate random variable with Bα
k = eAα
k , for k ∈Ωand α ∈[d].
• B = arcsin A is a random variable with Bk = arcsin Ak for k ∈Ω.
There are some miscellaneous operations and definitions that will be important in the future.
Definition II.18 (Truncation). Consider a univariate random variable X, we denote its truncation to threshold K
(where K ⩾0) JXKK to be a random variable such that for all k ∈Ω:
(JXKK)k =





−K
Xk < −K

|Xk| ⩽K

X > K
(12)
We will also need to define truncation for multivariate random variable.
Definition II.19 (Truncation of Multivariate Random Variable). Consider a multivariate random variable ⃗X, we
denote its truncation to threshold K (where K ⩾0) JXKK to be a random variable such that for all k ∈Ω:
(JXKK)k =
( ⃗Xk

Definition II.20 (Inner Product). Given vectors ⃗u,⃗v ∈Rd, there inner product ⟨u, v⟩is defined as ⟨u, v⟩=
Pd
α=1 uαvα, where subscript is the index for dimension.
Given vector ⃗u ∈Rd and read multivariate random variable ⃗X, their inner product is a univariate random variable
⟨⃗u, ⃗X⟩= Pd
α=1 uαX α.
Definition II.21 (Vector Encoding). Given vector ⃗u ∈S ⊆Rd, where S is some finite set that is made clear within
the context, we can use a quantum register in Hilbert space HS to encode the vector denoted as |⃗u⟩.
A random variable has expectations and variances which we will define here:
