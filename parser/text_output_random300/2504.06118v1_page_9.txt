from Horndeski theory [66].
Within the w(z) cold dark matter (CDM) framework,
w(z) is discretized into N = 29 piecewise-constant seg-
ments, w ≡{w1, w2, . . . , wN}, uniformly spaced in scale
factor for z < 2.5. Additionally, an extra ‘wide’ bin
wwide = −1 is assigned for z > 2.5 up to recombina-
tion.4 Alongside these wi, we vary several cosmological
parameters: ΩM, the current fractional matter density;
Ωbh2, the physical baryon density; H0, the Hubble con-
stant; and Mb, the absolute SNe magnitude (used only
when supernova data are included).
We place sufficiently broad flat priors on all param-
eters,5 and explore the resulting parameter space using
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm im-
plemented in Cobaya [67]. At each step, we compute a
total χ2 that combines contributions from both the data
and the correlation prior. The prior term is given by
χ2
prior = DT
w C−1
Π Dw, where Dw ≡w −wfid. Follow-
ing [63, 64, 68], we determine wfid at each MCMC step
by averaging over neighboring w bins. The prior covari-
ance CΠ is derived from Horndeski-based simulations [65]
spanning a broad parameter space. Further technical de-
tails are provided in the Supplemental Material.
We validate our pipeline using mock datasets gener-
ated for four dark energy models shown in Sec. XI in
Supplemental Material, before applying to actual obser-
vations. Fig. 3 (white curves and blue bands) illustrates
the best-fit and 68% CL constraints on w(z) obtained
from various data combinations. The upper row corre-
sponds to DESI DR1 BAO data, and the lower row to
DR2. In each row, the leftmost panel reports BAO-only
constraints, while the other panels incorporate additional
supernova datasets: PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5.
In all cases, w(z) ̸= −1 is clearly indicated. Through-
out the paper, we define the significance (i.e., the signal-
to-noise ratio, SNR) of the reconstructed w(z) deviating
from a specific model wmod via
SNR2 ≡(w −wmod)T C−1
w (w −wmod),
(5)
where Cw is the posterior covariance for the w bins. For
the DR1-based reconstructions (panels A1–A4), the SNR
of w ̸= −1 is 2.6, 3.9, 3.9, and 4.2, respectively. Switch-
ing to the DR2 dataset yields comparable significance at
2.6, 3.7, 4.3, and 4.5, respectively. It is interesting that
the preference for deviations from ΛCDM when the SNe
samples are included remained strong with the enhanced
statistical power of DESI DR2.
All dataset combinations exhibit a persistent pattern
in w(z): w > −1 at z ≲0.2 and w < −1 at z ∼0.75,
which is consistent with the results reported in compan-
4 Allowing wwide to vary left it largely unconstrained by our data,
and it showed minimal correlations with the other w bins. We
therefore fix wwide = −1 for simplicity.

[−3, 2], and wi ∈[−6, 4] (for i = 1, . . . , 29).
ion DESI papers [44, 45]. Including supernova data high-
lights this feature further, revealing pronounced oscilla-
tions in w(z). These patterns remain stable and gain ad-
ditional significance when DR1 BAO is replaced by DR2.
The green bands—reconstructions using the CPL param-
eterization—track the transition across w = −1 well and
are broadly compatible with the non-parametric results,
reinforcing the robustness of these conclusions.
While the significance of w ̸= −1 stems from the re-
duction in χ2 relative to ΛCDM, fully assessing the fit
also requires determining the effective degrees of freedom
(DoF) in the reconstructed w(z). This step is nontrivial
because the correlation prior couples the w(z) bins. To
address this, we perform a principal component analysis
(PCA) [69] to decorrelate the prior and posterior inverse
covariance matrices of w(z). Further technical details on
the PCA procedure can be found in the Supplemental
Material.
Fig. 4 shows the PCA results for the reconstructed dark
energy equation of state w(z). The left panels (A1–A4)
plot the eigenvectors of the first few well-constrained
modes, highlighting their redshift dependence, while the
right panels (B1–B4) display the corresponding eigen-
values λi for different dataset combinations. The PCA
identifies independent modes constrained by the data.
In panel A1 (BAO-only), the first principal component
(PC1) is smooth and relatively featureless, indicating
that BAO data alone primarily constrain a single domi-
nant mode of w(z). By contrast, adding supernova data
(panels A2–A4) produces additional constrained modes;
PC2 and PC3 become more oscillatory, especially at low
redshift, demonstrating that supernova observations sig-
nificantly improve constraints on the redshift evolution
of w(z).
The right panels show the eigenvalues λi, which quan-
tify the statistical significance of each mode (larger val-
ues correspond to tighter constraints). In panel B1 (also
BAO-only), four eigenvalue notably exceeds that of the
correlation prior (green curve). When supernova datasets
are incorporated (panels B2–B4), more modes become
well constrained. Comparing DESI Data Release 1 (DR1;
orange) and Data Release 2 (DR2; blue) eigenvalues re-
veals that DR2 consistently achieves larger eigenvalues
for the constrained modes, indicating stronger statistical
power in the DR2 sample. This gain is most evident when
supernova data are included, as the gap between the first
few eigenvalues of DR1 and DR2 widens, showing that
DR2 improves constraints across multiple modes of w(z).
We further validate these findings by computing the effec-
tive number of degrees of freedom Neff numerically with
covariant principal component analysis (CPCA) [70], de-
tailed in the Supplemental Material. The CPCA results
align with the PCA, confirming the robustness of our as-
sessment of how many independent modes of w(z) are
constrained by the data.
We can project w(z) onto the PC eigenmodes 1 +
w(z) = P
i γiei(z) where the corresponding eigenvalue
λi of the covariance matrix represents the error of the
