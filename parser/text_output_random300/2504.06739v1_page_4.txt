We solve these equations approaching the limit β →∞
for the ground state at the half-band ﬁlling (N = 4L). In
calculations, we ﬁrst adopt the previously mentioned re-

Other model parameters are ﬁxed at az/a0 = 1, tc = 1,
tf = 0, E0 = −5. The inverse temperature is ﬁxed at
β = 400 which is suﬃcient for identifying the ground
state by convergent numerical calculations.
Next, we
focus on the A-B pattern using the simpliﬁed V1-V2
hybridizations, by tuning the model parameters V , α,
and tf, respectively. Our primary strategy is to search
for the region of V
where the nonzero solutions for
(rA, rB) are obtained at the zero temperature limit. In
this region, the corresponding Kondo energy scales are
identiﬁed as the ﬁnite temperatures TKη beyond which
rη are suppressed.

MAIN RESULTS
A.
Evolution of the Kondo phase
The previous mean-ﬁeld equations for the order param-
eters rη and λη are solved numerically for a wide range
of model parameters, especially for variable interlayer hy-
bridization parameters. Due to the Mx symmetry and
using the length cut-oﬀ(chosen as ξ =
√
3), there are
5 × 4 = 20 major hybridization elements V (∆1,∆2)
ηη′
as
plotted in SM-B. All these hybridization elements are
functions of the hybridization strength V , chosen as the
nearest-neighbor interlayer hybridization. We ﬁnd that
the numerical solution for non-vanishing rA or rB does
not exist if V just slightly increases from zero. This fact
implies that the Kondo phase could not be accessed by
treating V as a perturbation. Therefore, we search for
the solutions of (rA, rB) as functions of the shift δx0 from
the large V side, i.e., V = 5, 4, 3, respectively. The rela-
tively larger V necessitates the occurrence of the KS in
the present Dirac metal bath. We then determine the
critical hybridization strength V = Vc where rA = 0 or
rB = 0 by decreasing V from this side as far as possible.
By this way we are able to draw the general phase dia-
gram which exhibits the evolution of the Kondo phase in
terms (δx0,V ).
As shown in the upper panel of Fig.2 (see Fig.12 for
more details), the KS occurs at δx0 = 0 with ﬁnite rA =
rB for V = 3, 4, 5, implying that the KS takes place in
both f electron sublattices with the same Kondo energy
scale, owing to the inversion symmetry. This phase is
enhanced by the increased strength V . When δx0 > 0,
rA becomes smaller than rB, indicating the emergence
of two distinct Kondo scales due to lack of the inversion
symmetry. Moreover, both rA and rB decrease with δx0
until δx0/a0 ∼0.5, where they tend to zero successively
depending on V : for V = 3, 4, they both tend to zero,
indicating the complete breakdown of KS; while for V =
5, we have rA ∼0, and rB has a minimum ∼0.22 for
δx0/a0 = 0.5 ∼0.6.
After that, while rA persists at
zero, rB increases again with a maxima at δx0/a0 = 1.
For each value of δx0, we can extract the critical Vc,A for
rA = 0 (dashed blue line ) or Vc,B for rB = 0 (solid orange
line) as shown in the lower panel in Fig.2, respectively.
These results indicate three facts:
(1) For a given
sliding shift δx0, there is a critical hybridizations Vc,η
for rη=0 below which the KS for f electrons in the η-
sublattice does not exist. For all values of δx0, we have
ﬁnite Vc,B ≤Vc,A.
In particular, Vc,A ∼Vc,B when
δx0 →0 or δx0 →3a0/2, although the corresponding
rA and rB are still distinct except in the vicinity of the
A-A or M-patterns recovering the inversion symmetry.
(2) There is a region (in δx0 = 0.5a0 ∼a0) where f elec-
trons are hybridized in the B sublattice (rB > 0) but de-
hybridized in the A sublattice (rA = 0). This is the gen-
uine orbital-( or lattice-) SKS with a single non-vanishing
Kondo energy scale. (3) While various hybridization pa-
rameters are variably at play in the intermediate region,
the nearest-neighbor hybridization V1 crucially inﬂuences
the formation of the KS in the region around the A-B
pattern.
Therefore, there are three distinct groundstate phases:
the fully decoupled local moment phase (FLM) where
V < Vc,A and V < Vc,B; the fully coupled KS phase
(FKS) where V > Vc,A and V > Vc,B; the genuine SKS
phase (SKS) where Vc,B < V < Vc,A. These phases are
clearly distinguished in the lower panel of Fig.2.

Existence and stability of SKS
Previous results hint the optimized SKS (rA = 0 and
rB takes a maxima) in the A-B pattern (δx0 = a0) where
the C3 symmetry is recovered. In this situation Vc,A is
