Here, Δ𝑦𝑜,(𝜏)  represents the observational increment, 𝑦𝑓
𝑝  is the “prior” model-estimated value at the 
observation location, 𝜎(𝜏) is the standard deviation of the multi-timescale (three timescales: stationary, low-
frequency, and high-frequency in this case) ensemble, 𝜎(𝑜) is the standard deviation of the observation, 𝑦𝑜 
is the observation, Δ𝑥𝑢 is the observation increment on the model grid after projection, 𝑐𝑜𝑣(Δ𝑥(𝜏), Δ𝑦(𝜏))  
is the covariance relationship between the model value at the model grid and the estimated model value at the 
observation location of each timescale filtering scheme, and 𝛼(𝜏) represents the adjustable weight coefficients 
in the combination of filters. 
Deep-ocean bias treatment. Given the scarcity of deep-ocean observations, an ocean model bias relaxing 
scheme [10] is used during CDA to control deep-ocean model bias and achieve coherent ocean stratification 
[3,25]. In this scheme, climatological temperature and salinity data are restored into the model space with 
depth-dependent restoration strength. Specifically, the upper ocean is primarily constrained by observations, 
while the deep ocean is relaxed towards the climatology of the World Ocean Atlas (WOA) [50,51]. On the 
basis of real-observation assimilation experiments with CM2 [29] and CESM [30], the restoration timescale is 
linearly related to depth, ranging from infinite to 360 days as depth increases from the surface to 1000 m, then 
decreasing to nearly 180 days at 1500 m. At greater depths, the restoration strength increases further, with a 
timescale of 30 days at the ocean bottom. 
Coupled data assimilation scheme. Ocean observations—including sea surface temperatures (SSTs) 
from the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature Dataset (HadISST) and Optimum Interpolation 
SST (OISST), as well as in-situ ocean temperature and salinity profiles since 1945—are assimilated into the 
CDA systems. To simplify the CDA framework for climate reanalysis, only surface pressure (Ps) data from the 
fifth-generation ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) atmospheric reanalysis products [52] are assimilated as the 
atmospheric “observations” (see Text S1c). The Ps data effectively represent all other atmospheric information 
by capturing whole-column atmospheric mass variation [52]. The assimilation of Ps increments uses an 
inverted projection method of the vertical integral, effectively extracting observational information into the 
models [53,54]. The CESM-CDA and CM2-CDA systems are initialized from their coupled states on January 
1, 1945, within their respective historical simulations. These systems completed their coupled reanalysis to the 
present, using historical radiative forcings, and followed the RCP45 scenario setting after 2007 (see Table S1).
