silver paste used to make sample contact. Figs. 3d-3e of the main text are from the 
second cycle measurement, and they correspond to (l) and (m) of Fig. S4, respectively. 
Both the two images in the main text share the same color scale bar from 600.0 mV to 
1.3 V.

Fig. S11. Full data for the extracted optical contrast between the two polar 
stackings of device 1. a&b, Full dataset for the extracted optical contrast between the 
two polar stackings from the first cycle (a) and second cycle (b) gate-dependent SNOM 
measurements. In both (a) and (b), the extracted optical contrast from Vg = 0 V to 
positive maximum Vg are denoted by red dots, those measured from positive maximum 
Vg to negative maximum Vg are denoted by the blues dots, and those measured from 
negative maximum Vg back to Vg = 0 V are denoted by green dots. The results shown 
in Fig. 2i of the main text correspond to the data denoted by the red dots and the data 
denoted by the blue dots on the negative Vg side. Insets in (a) and (b): the white boxes 
label the sample areas of the two nearby regions from which we extract the average 
optical near-field response and obtain the optical contrast. The scale bars in the two 
insets are both 1 Âµm.
