replacement of I−ions by Br−ions in fixed ratios was
followed. This method can serve as an efficient tool for
improving the stability of the material. No results from
the literature were found for studies of the SbH4BrxI1−x
perovskite structure in which bromide ions are replaced
stepwise by iodide ions. Therefore, results of this research
can be of primary importance.
The main purpose of this study is to investigate
whether the band gap value, which increases as a result
of the replacement of I−ions with Br−ions, can be re-
duced by the SbH+
4 cation. In the current research, first-
principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
taking into account van der Waals (vdW) interactions
used15–18. The vdW corrections need to be included to
properly mimic the interactions at organo–inorganic in-
terfaces and examine the structural behavior of hybrid
perovskites. By including vdW effects, the DFT calcula-
tions performed in this study agree more closely with ex-
perimental measurements, which increases the reliability
of the theoretical method for prediction of photovoltaic
material performance.

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
In this study, first-principles calculations were per-
formed to investigate the electronic and structural prop-
erties of the material.
The calculations were con-
ducted within the framework of density functional theory
(DFT)15,16 using the Quantum ESPRESSO package17,18.
The exchange-correlation effects were treated using the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional19. The pro-
jector augmented wave (PAW) method20,21 was employed
to describe the core-valence electron interactions, with
pseudopotentials taken from the PBE PAW pseudopo-
tential library. A variable cell relaxation (vc-relax) cal-
culation was performed to optimize atomic positions and
cell parameters. The convergence threshold for the self-
consistent field (SCF) calculations was set to 1 × 10−5
Ry for the total energy and 1 × 10−4 Ry/au for the force
convergence. The plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff was
chosen as 60 Ry. Brillouin zone integration was carried
out using a Monkhorst-Pack22 k-point mesh. A 6 × 6 × 6
k-point grid was used for structural optimization, while
a denser 13 × 13 × 13 k-point grid was employed for the
density of states (DOS) calculations. To accurately ac-
count for van der Waals (vdW) interactions, the DFT-D3
method23 was applied.
The effective mass m∗, which is important for describ-
ing the dynamic properties of charge carriers, is obtained
from the curvature of the energy band structure. The
band structures were obtained by DFT, and the energy
dispersion E(k) near the conduction band minimum or
the valence band maximum is approximated as parabolic.
This hypothesis enables us to approximate the energy by
a second-order Taylor expansion when the wave vector k
is small.
Then, the curvature of the band is analyzed by cal-
culating the second derivative d2E
dk2 within the parabolic
range. The effective mass is calculated using the relation
m∗= ¯h2
d2E
dk2
−1

where ¯h is the reduced Planck constant. Lastly, effec-
tive mass is obtained by multiplying the inverse of cur-
vature by ¯h2, where ¯h = 1.0545718 × 10−34 J · s in SI
units.
This technique effectively relates the band curvature to
the effective mass of charge carriers, therefore providing
valuable insights into carrier transport in semiconductor
substances.

RESULTS & DISCUSSION
In this theoretical study, comparison was done by
structures derived based on methylammonium lead io-
dide (MAPbI3), a hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite
of special interest after its potential application in so-
lar cells and optoelectronic devices24. The structure pa-
rameters derived in the investigated systems are given in
Table I. For MAPbI3, the computed lattice parameters
are a = 6.36 ˚A, b = 6.33 ˚A, and c = 6.37 ˚A. Experi-
mental studies employing X-ray diffraction analysis have
reported lattice parameters in the range of 6.32–6.33 ˚A25,
in agreement with the calculations presented in this work.
As shown in the optimized structure of MAPbI3 pre-
sented in Figure 1, the Pb–I bond lengths on the side
where the methylammonium (MA+) cation is attached
are bent inward and measured to be 3.18 ˚A. This value
is in good agreement with the previously reported exper-
imental value of approximately 3.18 ˚A26. These compar-
isons indicate that the computational methodology used
in this research correctly describes the structural features
of MAPbI3.
