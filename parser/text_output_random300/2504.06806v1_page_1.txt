Abstract 
The prediction of protein stability changes following single-point mutations plays a pivotal 
role in computational biology, particularly in areas like drug discovery, enzyme 
reengineering, and genetic disease analysis. Although deep-learning strategies have pushed 
the field forward, their use in standard workflows remains limited due to resource demands. 
Conversely, potential-like methods are fast, intuitive, and efficient. Yet, these typically 
estimate Gibbs free energy shifts without considering the free-energy variations in the 
unfolded protein state, an omission that may breach mass balance and diminish accuracy. 
This study shows that incorporating a mass-balance correction (MBC) to account for the 
unfolded state significantly enhances these methods. While many machine learning models 
partially model this balance, our analysis suggests that a refined representation of the 
unfolded state may improve the predictive performance.
