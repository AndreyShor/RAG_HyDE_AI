Since ϵ ≡τ/Ra1/2 is small, we use an asymptotic approach for this analysis
(expanding q = q0 + ϵq1 + ...). In the unsaturated region, we solve
d2q
dz2 = 0
⇒
d2q0
dz2 + ϵd2q1
dz2 ≈0.
(34)
In the saturated region,
d2q
dz2 = q −qs
ϵ
⇒
q0 = qs(q0)
&
q1 = d2q0/dz2
1 + αγq0

where we have used a first order Taylor expansion about q0. The O(ϵ) term is required
to balance the diffusion of the O(1) solution. Note that the leading order solution has
zero condensation and hence precipitation (C(z) = 0 ⇒P = 0), since q = qs for
z ≥zs, and so we also need to consider the O(ϵ) terms for the water budget equation
(21) to be consistent. The analytical, asymptotic, basic state solution is given by
q = q0 + ϵq1 + ..., where

Here W is the Lambert-W function (the implicit solution of W(x) exp(W(x)) = x
for any x). This solution was verified by comparison with a numerical solution to
the non-linear boundary value problem (see Figure 3,Oishi and Brown (2024), and
supplementary material for further details of this comparison). Note that the moist
pseudoadiabtic boundary conditions only hold to leading order: for the q(1) = qs(1)
condition to hold in the O(ϵ) solution, we require a boundary layer of O(ϵ3/2), which
is evident from the numerical profile of condensation in Figure 3.
Profiles of all other quantities can be deduced once q(z) is known, by addition-
ally using the solution m(z) from equation (32). The profiles are shown for a specific
set of climate parameters in Figure 3. Each of the profiles in Figure 3 show a lower
unsaturated region (where q < qs or RH < 1), matched onto a saturated upper region
(where q ≥qs or RH ≥1), apart from the discontinuous condensation profile. Note
that the basic state solution is saturated aloft, which differs from the real atmosphere,
which is unsteady and nonlinear, but close to the moist pseudoadiabat with some
conditional instability present. Figure 4 confirms how the upper profile is close to the
moist pseudoadiabat, in contrast with Vallis et al. (2019), Agasthya et al. (2025) and
Oishi and Brown (2024) where the fixed upper temperature condition prevents this
adjustment.
