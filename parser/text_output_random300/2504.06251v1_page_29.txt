Extended Data Fig. 5 | Uniform electronic structure at different sample positions. a, Optical
image of non-aligned R5G/BN (sample S2), with red and blue curves indicating R5G and B5G
regions. b, NanoARPES spatial image with a similar range of the optical image. c-f, Dispersion
images measured at positions from P1 to P4 as indicated in b, with the cutting direction along Î“-K
as indicated by vertical line in the inset.
