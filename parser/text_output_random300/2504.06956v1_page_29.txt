Local structure of extremal points

Proof. The proof follows the exact same argument as in the proof of [BL18, Lemma 5.4] (see also
[BL18, Lemma 5.6] for a related statement about Brownian bridges). In particular, the lower bound
follows trivially from Lemma A.1, while the upper bound follows from Lemmas A.5, A.7, and A.10.
We now have all the necessary ingredients to prove Proposition 4.14.
Proof of Propositon 4.14. We will only prove (4.31), as the proof of (4.32) is completely analogous
and, in fact, simpler.
The proof is based on a sequence of replacements that gradually convert one expectation into the
other. We can and will assume that the function F âˆˆCb
loc(C(Rd)) depends only on the value of the
field inside the ball Bk0 for some fixed k0 > 0. For b âˆˆN, l âˆˆ[b âˆ’1]0, and k âˆˆ[l]0, on the event
{Kb â‰¤l}, arguing as in Remark 4.7, we have that
sup
xâˆˆBk
|Î¥b,g(x) âˆ’Î¥l(x)| â‰²eâˆ’(lâˆ’k)/2(log l)2 .
(4.34)
Step 1: We start by replacing Î¥b,g by Î¥l in the argument of F. For k â‰¥k0, we recall that on the event
{Kb â‰¤k}, both Î¥b,g and Î¥l are bounded on Bk0 by a quantity depending only on k. Therefore, for
k0 < k < l < b, using the uniform continuity of F on compacts, the bound in (4.34), and Lemma 4.10,
we obtain that for any Îµ > 0, by taking b > l both large enough,
E0,u,b
h
|F(Î¥b,g) âˆ’F(Î¥l)|1{M0,b(Î¥b,g)â‰¤Î»}1{Kbâ‰¤k}
i
â‰¤Îµu
b .
(4.35)
Similarly, using the boundedness of F and Lemma 4.10, we also have that for any Îµ > 0, by taking
k > 0 large enough, it holds that
E0,u,b
h
|F(Î¥b,g) âˆ’F(Î¥l)|1{M0,b(Î¥b,g)â‰¤Î»}1{Kb>k}
i
â‰¤Îµu
b .
(4.36)
Hence, (4.35) and (4.36) imply that, for any Îµ > 0, by taking b > k both large enough, it holds that

h
F(Î¥b,g)1{M0,b(Î¥b,g)â‰¤Î»}

F(Î¥l)1{M0,b(Î¥b,g)â‰¤Î»}
i â‰¤Îµu

(4.37)
Step 2: In this step, we show that for any Îµ > 0, by taking b > l both large enough, it holds that
E0,u,b

F(Î¥l)1{M0,b(Î¥b,g)â‰¤Î»}

To this end, for Î´ âˆˆ(0, Î»), and k0 < k < l < b, we define the event Eb,l,k,Î´ by letting
Eb,l,k,Î´

For any Îµ > 0, by Lemmas 4.10, 4.13, 4.16, and A.11 for l > k both large enough and Î´ > 0 small

Therefore, so far we proved that, for b > l both large enough, it holds that

Now, we can choose l â‰¥k large enough in such a way that the right-hand side of (4.34) is less than
Î´ for j âˆˆ[k] and less than Rk(j) for j âˆˆ{k + 1, . . . , l} (assuming that the constant C > 0 in the
