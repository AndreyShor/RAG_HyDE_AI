Although the three effective interactions share properties
(i)-(vi), their underlying basic interactions—1/r, waa(r) and
wcd(r)—differ fundamentally. Notably, waa(r) depends on
the system’s periodicity through the parameter rs, whereas the
bare Coulomb interaction and wcd(r) do not. Consequently,
the bulk potential described by νaa(r, L) depends not only on
the configuration of the surrounding charges but also on the
setup of the primary cell. In contrast, the following prop-
erty of bulk invariance applies exclusively to νe3dtf(r, L) and
νcd(r, L).
(vii) Bulk Invariance. In the left panel of Fig. 1 (P = 1), if
all the charges within the crystal collectively act as the source
subject to an extended periodicity of 3L, the potential at the
target point remains unchanged, provided the basic interaction
is L-independent,
ν(r, L) = ν(r, 3L) +
1
X
n̸=0
[ν(r + nL, 3L) −ν(nL, 3L)] .
(31)
This invariance holds even when generalized to arbitrary pri-
mary cells with variations in shape, size, or both.
Conversely, defining r = sL reveals that both 1/(sL) and
waa(sL) are inversely proportional to L for the fixed dimen-
sionless parameter s, whereas wcd(sL) is not. As a conse-
quence, the following property of scaling behavior applies ex-
clusively to νe3dtf(r, L) and νaa(r, L).
(viii) Scaling Behavior. For any fixed dimensionless vector
s, ν(sL, L) scales as 1/L, yielding an identity of the deriva-
tive:
∂ν(sL, L)
∂L

s
= −ν(sL, L)

This scaling behavior underpins the classical result that the
pressure of a Coulomb system is uniquely determined by its
potential energy—a relation known since the 19th century
[10].
In the field of molecular dynamics simulations, this
energy-pressure relation often serves as a validation criterion
for the convergence of the Ewald summation (e.g.[43, 44]).
Eq. (32) establishes critical criteria for effective interactions
to preserve the energy-pressure relation, as detailed in Sec-
tion V.

ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIALS AND ENERGIES
The
effective
interaction
ν(r, L)
corresponds
to
νe3dtf(r, L) for the Coulomb interaction,
νaa(r, L) for
the angular-averaged interaction truncated at the L-dependent
distance rs, and νcd(r, L) for some modified Coulomb
interaction truncated at the fixed cutoff rc, respectively. It
represents the bulk electric potential produced by a unit
charge under PBC, expressed in a unified manner. Under this
unified framework, a point charge q, acting as the source,
generates an electric potential qν(r, L) at the displacement r,
analogous to the conventional electric potential q/r generated
under the open boundary condition.
This analysis extends
naturally to any N-particle system. When focusing on the
position of the i-th particle ri, the remaining N −1 charges
collectively act as the source, generating an electric potential
at ri:
ϕpp(i) =
N
X
j=1,j̸=i
qjν(ri −rj, L).
(33)
For
charge-neutral
systems
satisfying
the
constraint,
PN
j=1 qj = 0, the neutralizing charge in any replica must
equal qi, since it is negative to the sum of the N −1 charges:
−
N
X
j=1,j̸=i
qj = qi.
(34)
As shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, this constraint ensures that
all replicas remain identical to the original N-particle system
regardless of which particle is focused. Consequently, ϕpp(i)
(for any i = 1, 2, · · · , N) fully accounts for interactions with
replicas of the entire N-particle system.
FIG. 3.
Primary cells (solid squares) and their replicas (dashed
squares) for a system composed of pure point charges (top) and a sys-
tem composed of both point charges and a charge distribution (bot-
tom). The target point is located either at the position of a point
charge or at an infinitesimally small region (bottom right) of the
charge continuum. The corresponding source is always the collec-
tion of the remaining charges. As long as the system is electrically
neutral, the replica remains identical to the system, regardless of the
target point. See Eqs. (33), (35) and (37).
If the system includes an extra charge continuum treated as
a collection of infinitely many point charges, each contribut-
ing an infinitesimal charge element ρ(r)dr at r, the total elec-
tric potential experienced by the i-th point charge becomes
ϕp(i) = ϕpp(i) + ϕpc(ri),
(35)
where ϕpc(r) is the electric potential at r produced solely by
the charge distribution,
ϕpc(r) =

dr′ ρ(r′)ν(r −r′, L).
