tom: the red point represents the result of the σ 7→0 extrap-
olation based on a joint fit of the continuum limit results ob-
tained using the so-called “sigmoid” (blue points) and “error-
function” (orange points) representations of Θσ(x), defined at
the beginning of Section VII of the companion paper [1]. For

using the Wilson-Clover Twisted-Mass discretization for
fermionic fields [41–43], at four values of the lattice spac-
ing (a ≥0.049 fm) and three values of the physical vol-
ume (L ≤7.6 fm).
In the companion paper [1] we provide a detailed descrip-
tion of all the steps of the numerical calculation, includ-
ing a thorough discussion of the specific implementation
of the HLT algorithm. Here, before discussing the phe-
nomenological implications of our results, we illustrate in
Figure 2 the quality of the data we use for the contin-
uum and σ 7→0 extrapolations of ¯Γ−1dΓ(0)/dω2 in the
dominant ¯c s channel at |ω| = 0.28. The top panel shows
results for σ = 100 MeV/mDs at four values of the lattice
spacings (black points) and the continuum-extrapolated
value (red point), obtained by combining multiple fits
using the Bayesian Model Average approach in Ref. [1].
The bottom panel demonstrates the σ 7→0 limit for two
different definitions of the kernel Θσ(x) (blue and orange
points), which coincide as σ 7→0. The red point is the
result of a combined σ 7→0 fit guided by the theoretical
asymptotic formulae derived in Ref. [1].

Our final determinations of the decay rate and

RESULTS
The total decay rate Γ is obtained by adding the integrals
over ω2 of the differential decay rates obtained in the dif-
ferent flavour channels. In the companion paper [1] we
have computed the Γ¯us contribution to the total rate and
shown that, at the present level of accuracy, it is negligi-
ble w.r.t. the statistical uncertainties of the dominating
Γ¯cs and Γ¯cd contributions. We have also discussed how
to interpolate and integrate the results for the ¯cs and ¯cd
flavor channels that are shown in Figure 3 together with
the associated error-budgets. The calculation of the first
two leptonic moments is carried out in a similar way.
Our final results are reported in Table I and, by using
the PDG [34] values |Vcs|PDG = 0.975(6) and |Vcd|PDG =
0.221(4), we get
Γ = |Vcs|2 Γ¯cs + |Vcd|2 Γ¯cd = 8.72(56) × 10−14 GeV ,

Our results can be compared with experimental measure-
ments from the CLEO [32] and BES-III [33] collabora-
tions, as well as their combined average [34]:
ΓCLEO = 8.56(55) × 10−14 GeV,

ΓBES−III = 8.27(22) × 10−14 GeV,

Γaverage = 8.31(20) × 10−14 GeV,

which are in excellent agreement with our theoretical pre-
diction in Eq. (7), as shown in the left panel of Figure 4.
