The Berry curvature is defined as:
Fµν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ + i[Aµ, Aν]

The quasi-topological theory is quite successful and natural to get gauge field theory.

BZ F ∈Z mapping directly to νqua = C. It corresponds to the Lowest Landau Level
when νqua = 1.
• QAHE: The minimum non-trivial Chern number C = 1 under the time reversal breaking, thus νqua = 1.
• Charge pumping: The charge transferred per cycle Q = e · νqua, with a single electron corresponding to
νqua = 1.
• Quantum gate: Geometric phase γ = πνqua, and νqua = 1 implements π phase gate.
• Boundary state: νqua = ±1 marks topologically non-trivial/trivial phase.
• Flux quantization: The Berry phase corresponds to the magnetic field in real space, with νqua =
