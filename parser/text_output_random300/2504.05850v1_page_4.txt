GRAPHICAL FUNCTIONS WITH SPIN

4. Feynman Periods
Consider a graph G with one external vertex 0 ∈RD (also labeled 0) and zero scaling weight
(15)
NG = 0.
For the definition of the period of G we pick any vertex z1 ̸= 0 in G (leading to the graph Gz1 with
two external vertices) and integrate the two-point function Aα
Gz1(0, z1) over the (D −1)-dimensional
unit-sphere parametrized by ˆz1 = z1/∥z1∥,

G = ∥z1∥D
Z
SD−1 Aα
Gz1(0, z1)dD−1ˆz1,
where the integral is normalized to
R
SD−1 dD−1ˆz1 = 1. The period of G depends neither on the choice of
0 and z1 nor on ∥z1∥.
Lemma 3. Let G be a graph with an external label 0 and NG = 0. Then, the integral (16) does not
depend on the choices of 0 and z1.
That is, P α
G is well defined and for every G′ which is G with a different external label 0 (0 in G is
internal in G′ and vice versa) we have NG′ = 0 and
(17)
P α
G = P α
G′.
Moreover, P α
G = 0 if the total spin |α| of G is odd.
Proof. It is obvious from the definition (14) that NG′ = 0.
We first show the independence of z1. The total scaling weight of Aα
Gz1(0, z1) is ∥z1∥−2λ(NG+(λ+1)/λ)
(because the graph Gz1 loses the internal vertex corresponding to z1). We obtain independence from
∥z1∥from (15) and (1). Independence from the orientation of z1 is explicit by integration over the unit
sphere.
Next, we prove the independence of the choice of z1 in G. We may assume that z1 = ˆz1 is a unit
vector. We pick an internal vertex in Gˆz1 and label it x1. Next, we scale all internal vertices ̸= x1
by xi 7→xi∥x1∥. From each edge e we extract the scaling weight ∥x1∥−2λνe of the propagator Qe. We
collect a total weight ∥x1∥−2D because NG = 0 and we are not scaling ˆz1 and x1. Moreover, the scaling
replaces x1 with the unit vector ˆx1 = x1/∥x1∥and ˆz1 with ˆz1/∥x1∥. We have integrations over ˆx1, ˆz1,
and ∥x1∥. We swap the variables ˆx1 and ˆz1 and invert ∥x1∥by ∥x1∥7→∥x1∥−1. The scaling weight
∥x1∥−2D compensates for the change in the integration measure. We combine the integral over the new
ˆx1 with the integral over ∥x1∥to the D-dimensional integral over x1 and the claim follows.
A transformation of all internal integration variables xi 7→−xi maps z1 to −z1. We pick up a sign
(−1)
P
e |αe| = (−1)|α| in the integral (16). Independence of z1 gives P α
G = 0 if |α| is odd.
A transformation of all internal integration variables xi 7→z1 −xi swaps 0 and z1 with a sign (−1)|α|.
If |α| is even, then (17) is proved. If |α| is odd, then (17) is trivial.
□
Assume that the spin |α| is even (otherwise P α
G = 0). Let π = π(α) be a partition of {α1, . . . , α|α|} into
pairs {πi1, πi2}, i = 1, . . . , |π| = |α|/2. Let Πα
0 be the set of all such partitions (later we will define Πα
1
and Πα
2 for 2- and 3-point functions). Note that the set Πα
0 has |Πα
0 | = (|α| −1)!! = |α|!/(2|α|/2(|α|/2)!)
elements.
Because P α
G does not depend on any external vectors, it is a sum over all possibilities to construct a
spin |α| vector from products of gαi,αj. For |α| ≥2 we obtain

P α
G =

π∈Πα

PG,πgπ(α),
where we used the notation
(19)
gπ = gπ11,π12 · · · gπN1,πN2
with N = |α|/2. For α = ∅we set PG,∅= PG and g∅= 1.
By contraction over repeated indices, π 7→gπ defines a bilinear form on Πα
0 ,
(20)
⟨π1, π2⟩0 = gπ1gπ2 ∈Z[D],
for π1, π2 ∈Πα
0 .
Lemma 4. The bilinear form ⟨·, ·⟩0 is nondegenerate.
