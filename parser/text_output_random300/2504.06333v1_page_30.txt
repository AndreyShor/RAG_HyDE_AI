The gray-colored terms must vanish to have a well-posed variational problem. We
can clearly see that we cannot impose Neumann boundary condition on a1,˜b1,b0
as the last term would not vanish, also we cannot remove that by adding any
boundary term, conﬁrming the fact that Z2e is not a subgroup of Z4. We tabulate
the list of relevant boundary conditions,

Case III : Anomaly resolution
Finally we discuss the case where we resolve the anomaly by introducing additional
symmetry. We start with an anomalous Z2 QFT, the SymTFT for such a theory
is given by the Dijkgraaf–Witten theory with a topological twist.
Sbulk = i
π ∫(a1db1 + 1
2a1da1).

The presence of anomalous coupling rules out the Neumann boundary condition
for a1. If we vary the action,
δS = ∫M3
(δa1db1 −da1δb1 + 1
2δa1da1 −1
2da1δa1) + ∫∂M3
(1
2a1δa1 + a1δb1).
To have a well-deﬁned variational problem, we need the boundary terms to vanish.
We can clearly see that, if a1 ﬂuctuates on the boundary, we cannot cancel the
boundary term a1δa1.
We intend to resolve the anomaly by adding trivial symmetries. We expect the
additional symmetries to mix non-trivially with the existing anomalous symmetry.
The situation can be summarized by a short exact sequence as follows,
0 Ð→Z2t Ð→Z4 Ð→Zω
2 Ð→0.
