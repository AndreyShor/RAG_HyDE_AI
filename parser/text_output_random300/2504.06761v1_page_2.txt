important structures that govern its behavior. Wall-bounded turbulence exhibits a complex,
multiscale nature characterized by hierarchical, interacting coherent structures governed by
intricate vortex dynamics (Pope 2000; Sayadi et al. 2013; Hickey et al. 2013). Building upon
Townsend’s attached-eddy hypothesis (Townsend 1976), hairpin vortices and their hierarchi-
cal organization have emerged as promising candidates for the fundamental structures that
shape wall turbulence dynamics (Marusic & Monty 2019). Hierarchical hairpin vortices are
arranged along the flow direction to form a vortex packet (Adrian 2007), not only driving
Reynolds stress generation but also orchestrate the spatial distribution of energy across scales.
Substantial evidence from both experiments (Wang et al. 2022) and simulations (Cheng et al.
2020; Hu et al. 2020) supports the existence of wall-attached eddies, which effectively recover
the statistical and structural features of wall turbulence. The evolution of attached-eddy
models (AEM) has established a theoretical framework linking these coherent structures
to turbulence’s statistical properties (Hu et al. 2023). Within this framework, a hierarchy
of geometrically self-similar flow structures (eddies) extending from the wall into the flow
can effectively model turbulent flows, especially in the logarithmic region, successfully
reproducing key statistical features such as the logarithmic velocity profile and high-order
moments of velocity fluctuations (Perry & Maruˇsi´c 1995; Woodcock & Marusic 2015).
Despite these theoretical advances, practical methodologies for incorporating these insights
into numerical simulations remain limited.
An alternative approach to understanding turbulence involves constructing turbulence itself
to replicate its structures and statistical properties. This inverse strategy not only enables the
validation of various models and theories but also facilitates practical applications, such
as generating realistic inlet or initial conditions for wall turbulence (Wu 2017). Generating
such conditions is challenging because simple random noise perturbations lack physically
meaningful structures, fail to satisfy continuity, and risk being damped by the pressure
equation. Traditional synthetic methods – including the random Fourier method (Kraichnan
1970), digital filtering method (Klein et al. 2003), and volume forcing method (Spille-Kohoff
& Kaltenbach 2001) – are widely used but often fail to reproduce the structural-statistical
coherence of real turbulence. While these methods can generate pseudo-turbulence with
targeted statistics, they require extensive adjustment zones for slow structural development,
leading to high computational costs. This persistent gap between coherent structures and
statistical fidelity underscores the need for novel physics-driven approaches to construct wall
turbulence.
Coherent-structure-based modeling of wall-bounded turbulent flow seeks to bridge this
gap by explicitly constructing flow fields. For instance, de Silva et al. (2016a) generated
three-dimensional (3D) synthetic velocity fields using discrete attached vortices. Building
on the hairpin-packet paradigm, they adopted packets of Λ-shaped vortices as representative
eddies. Subsequent refinements to this strategy include incorporating spatial repulsion effects
among same-scale vortices (de Silva et al. 2016b), embedding streamwise meandering
of large-scale structures (Eich et al. 2020), and developing spectral scaling-based AEM
extensions (Chandran et al. 2020). While these synthetic attempts retain key structural
features, their vortex geometries remain oversimplified. Flow fields are computed via the Biot-
Savart law using idealized vortex filaments without core variations, limiting their ability to
replicate realistic flow dynamics. Since flow predictions are highly sensitive to the geometry
of representative structures (Deshpande et al. 2021) and methods for constructing complex
vortices near walls remain underdeveloped, these simplifications limit their applicability to
construct intricately structured vortices and generate more realistic wall turbulence fields.
In particular, they constrain the accurate representation of high-order statistical moment
distributions across different Reynolds numbers, which have not been reported in previous
studies on synthetic wall turbulence.
