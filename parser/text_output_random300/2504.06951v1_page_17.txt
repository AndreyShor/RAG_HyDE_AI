N = 320
The figures provide clear evidence that the lowest eigenvalues become nearly doubly degenerate, a charac-
teristic feature of a Schrödinger operator with a double-well potential. For a more detailed discussion on
the approximation of this Schrödinger operator by the Curie-Weiss model, we refer the reader to [31].

Extremal spectral behavior of ¯Hs
N
The figures reported in the previous section inform of localization results, beyond the proven distributional
results. Here we show that in the two considered setting of parameters (Γ = B = 1 and Γ = 2B = 1), not
only the spectrum of ¯Hs
N is contained in the interior of the range of the GLT symbol, but the behavior of
the extreme eigenvalues is very regular. In fact, both the minimal and the minimal eigenvalues converge
monotonically to the minimum and to maximum of the symbol, respectively: again this phenomenon is
typical of matrix-valued LPOs [23].
For the minimum/maximum eigenvalue analysis, for Γ = B = 1 and we proceed as follows.
• The GLT symbol is κ(x, θ) = −Γ
2 (2x −1)2 −2B cos(θ)
p
(1 −x)x.
• We consider m =
min
(x,θ)∈[0,1]×[0,π]κ(x, θ), M =
max
(x,θ)∈[0,1]×[0,π]κ(x, θ).
• Take Nj + 1 = 40 ∗2j,
j = 0, 1, 2, 3,
• Compute τj = λmin( ¯Hs

j = 0, 1, 2, 3,
• Compute αj = log
