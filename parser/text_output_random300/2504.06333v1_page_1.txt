In this paper we generalize previous results on anomaly resolution to nonin-
vertible symmetries. Brieﬂy, given a global symmetry G of some theory with a
’t Hooft anomaly rendering it ungaugeable, the idea of anomaly resolution is to
extend G to a larger anomaly-free symmetry of the same theory with a trivially-
acting kernel. In previous work, several of the coauthors demonstrated that in
two-dimensional theories, by virtue of decomposition, gauging the larger symme-
try is equivalent to a disjoint union of theories in which a nonanomalous subgroup
of G is gauged. In this paper, we consider examples in which the larger symmetry
is not a group, but instead a noninvertible symmetry deﬁned by some fusion cat-
egory. In principle the same ideas apply to the case that G itself is noninvertible.
We discuss the construction of larger symmetries using both SymTFT methods as
well as algebraically via (quasi-)Hopf algebras.
