including the variability timescale of ∼1 day and a low
Doppler factor of 0.48.
The strong radio source S3 1227+25 (I. Pauliny-
Toth et al. 1972) at R.A.=187◦.560, decl.=25◦.298, also
known as ON 246 (R. Dixon & J. Kraus 1968), was first
identified as a BL Lac candidate based on the corre-
lation study between the ROSAT all-Sky Survey and
the Hamburg Quasar Survey (N. Bade et al. 1994).
Several studies have been carried out to classify this
source based on the synchrotron peak frequency (νpeak).
The observed νpeak values are 1014.11 Hz (Z.-Z. Wu
et al. 2009), 1014.41±0.13 Hz (J. Fan et al. 2016), and
1014.91 Hz (M. Ackermann et al. 2015).
These stud-
ies indicate that this source lies near the boundary be-
tween intermediate synchrotron peak blazar (IBL) and
high synchrotron peak blazar (HBL) in the classifica-
tion scheme. VERITAS (A. Acharyya et al. 2023) has
detected this source in very high energy (VHE) band
during MJD 57158-57160 and the average integral flux
of (4.51 ± 0.44) × 10−11 cm−2 s−1 above 0.12 TeV was
reported. This source is one of the IBL objects detected
so far in the VHE band. P. Kharb et al. (2008) resolved
a parsec-scale core with radio observations. For the sci-
entific study, we adopted the redshift (z) = 0.325 from
A. Acharyya et al. (2023) in this work.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 cov-
ers multi-wavelength observations and reduction tech-
niques.
In Section 3, we explore quasi-periodicity
analysis using different methodologies, including the
Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP), Weighted Wavelet
Z-transform (WWZ), and REDFIT. Section 4 focuses
on Gaussian process modeling with a damped random
walk model.
In Section 5, we assess the significance
of quasi-periodic signals (QPOs) using two independent
approaches, including Monte Carlo simulations and red
noise modeling of light curves. Section 8 presents the
findings of our QPO study, while Section 9 presents
an interpretation of the observed QPO across multiple
bands and wraps up with a conclusion.
2. MULTI-WAVELENGTH OBSERVATIONS
2.1. Fermi-LAT observation
The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, launched by
NASA on June 11, 2008, onboard two instruments: the
Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor (GBM). Together, they enable comprehensive
gamma-ray observations across a wide energy range,
from a few keV to 500 GeV. The Fermi-LAT, a pair-
conversion gamma-ray detector, is designed to explore
high-energy gamma rays from ∼20 MeV to 500 GeV. It
provides a wide field of view (>2 sr ), covering about
20% of the entire sky. Since its launch, Fermi-LAT has
conducted all-sky surveys every three hours, providing
near-continuous observations of γ-ray emissions from as-
trophysical sources (W. Atwood et al. 2009).
We collected Fermi-LAT data of blazar ON 246 dur-
ing the period 2012 January 6 (MJD 55932) to 2023
May 17 (MET 60081) (over 1.6 years). During the data
download procedure, we chose the energy range of 0.1-
300 GeV with Pass8 class events (evclass==128, ev-
type==3) recommended by the Fermi-LAT collabora-
tion from a region of interest (ROI) with a radius of 10◦
centered at the source (R.A.=187◦.560, decl.=25◦.298
). The analysis of γ-rays was performed following the
standard procedures for point-source analysis using the
Fermi Science Tools package (v11r05p3), provided by
the Fermi Science Support Center.
To minimize con-
tamination from the Earth’s limb, a zenith angle cut
of > 90◦was applied.
The good time interval (GTI)
data was extracted using the standard filtering using
filter (DATA QUAL > 0) && (LAT CONFIG == 1) to en-
sure high-quality observations. We used GTLTCUBE and
GTEXPOSURE tools to calculate the integrated livetime
as a function of sky position and off-axis angle and
exposure, respectively. To model the galactic and ex-
tragalactic diffuse background emissions, we used mod-
els gll iem v07.fits1 and iso P8R3 SOURCE V3 v1.txt1,
respectively.
Further, we used the make4FGLxml.py
script to create the source model XML file, which con-
tains the information about the source location and the
best prediction of spectral form. The unbinned likeli-
hood analysis was performed with GTLIKE tool (W.
Cash 1979; J. R. Mattox et al. 1996) using the XML
spectrum file, and the instrumental response function
(IRF) ”P8R3 SOURCE V3” was adopted to get the fi-
nal source spectrum.
To find the significance of the
source of interest, we used GTTSMAP tool to calcu-
late the test statistics (TS), which is defined as TS =
2∆log(likelihood) = -2log( L
L0 ), where L and L0 are the
maximum likelihood of the model with and without a
point source at the target location and maximum likeli-
hood value fitted by the background model, respectively.
The significance of finding the source at the specified po-
sition is accessed by the TS value with TS ∼σ2 (J. R.
Mattox et al. 1996).
We adopted a criterion with TS(≥9) for data points
in the light curve, and a weekly binned light curve is
generated using Fermipy2. The resulting weekly binned
γ-ray light curve is shown in Figure 1.
