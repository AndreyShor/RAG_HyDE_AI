Acknowledgments.
The numerical simulations were carried out using the resources of the Pole
Scientifique de Mod´elisation Num´erique & Centre Blaise Pascal at ENS de Lyon, and in particular
the SIDUS system (Quemener and Corvellec 2013). We are grateful to Cerasela Calugaru and
Emmanuel Quemener for their help with the platform. This work was supported by the ANR Grant
TippingWinds, Project No. ANR-21-CE30-0016-01 and MPB acknowledges funding from the UK
Natural Environment Research Council (Grant NE/T006269/1).
Data availability statement.
The numerical model simulations upon which this study
is based are too large to archive or to transfer.
Instead,
we provide all the in-
formation needed to replicate the simulations;
the model version is available online at
https://github.com/cbherbert/Isca/tree/eddyforcing. The model compilation scripts, boundary con-
dition files and data postprocessing codes are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15181902.
