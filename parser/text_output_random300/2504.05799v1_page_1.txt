Abstract
For the general two-Higgs doublet model with Yukawa sector of type II (type II 2HDM),
the Higgs alignment limit conditions are obtained for the neutral Higgs bosons with in-
deﬁnite CP-parity h1, h2 or h3, based on the symbolic results relating the elements of the
mixing matrix to the masses of the Higgs bosons and the mixing angles. The results are
valid up to dimension-six operators in the decomposition of the eﬀective Higgs potential.
Within the framework of the obtained Higgs alignment conditions, the possibility of the ex-
istence of light scalars is discussed. Within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM) framework, four benchmark scenarios are proposed. It is shown that two of them
predict phenomenologically distinguishable CP-violating interactions of the Higgs boson
h3 with up-fermions.
