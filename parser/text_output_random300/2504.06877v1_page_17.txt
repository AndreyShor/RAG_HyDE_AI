Stochastic unraveling
We split action (2) into two terms which describe dissipation and fluctuations, respectively:

Here, we used relation between retarded and advanced components of the polarization opera-

Since this kernel is positive-definite, the first exponential in (48) can be associated with a
measure of stochastic Gaussian process ξ(t) with two-point correlators (8). Collecting the
factors, we obtain (9).

Transmission coefficient
To calculate the transmission coefficient, we send a signal vp(t) to the probe line which is
weakly coupled to the resonator. The equations of motion for the flux degrees of freedom in
