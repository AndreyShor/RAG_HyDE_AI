The action of the membrane
A two-dimensional membrane in an 11-dimensional spacetime can be expressed
using the Nambu bracket by appropriately gauge-ﬁxing the bosonic part of the
Nambu-Goto-type membrane action as follows:
S =
Z
d3σ 1
2{XI, XJ, XK}2.
(2.1)
Here, XI(σ1, σ2, σ3) represents the spacetime coordinates of the membrane,
where I = 0, . . . , 10. The parameters σi with i = 1, 2, 3 are the internal pa-
rameters of the membrane. The expression {XI, XJ, XK} is called the Nambu
bracket and is deﬁned by
{XI, XJ, XK} = ǫijk ∂XI
∂σi
∂XJ
∂σj
∂XK
∂σk .
(2.2)
This action is invariant under the volume-preserving deformation (VPD), rep-
resented by the transformation:
δVPDXI = {Q1, Q2, XI}
(2.3)
where Q1 and Q2 are arbitrary charges.
To perform matrix regularization, we want to decompose this Nambu bracket
using the Poisson bracket. Here, the Poisson bracket for the two components
σ1 and σ2 among the three components is deﬁned as:
{A, B} = ǫab ∂A
∂σa
∂B
∂σb
(2.4)
where a = 1, 2.
However, a straightforward decomposition of the Nambu bracket using the
Poisson bracket followed by matrix regularization causes a loss of the Funda-
mental Identity (F.I.) that the Nambu bracket originally possessed. This leads
to a breakdown of the transformation properties related to the composition of
deformations.
In this study, we avoid this problem by rewriting the Nambu bracket into a
special form using the Poisson bracket and then partially restricting the volume-
preserving deformation. This approach preserves the essential properties of the
transformation and allows for a consistent matrix model.
Speciﬁcally, the Nambu bracket can be rewritten as follows:5
{XI, XJ, XK} = {τ(XI, XJ), XK} + ∂XK
∂σ3 {XI, XJ} + Σ(XI, XJ; XK) (2.5)
5While this decomposition is motivated by the structure of Takhtajan’s action, which
corresponds to the Hamiltonian formulation of Nambu mechanics, it is important to note that
the decomposition itself can be regarded as a purely algebraic transformation, independent of
any speciﬁc dynamical framework.
Takhtajan’s action serves as the Hamiltonian formulation of Nambu mechanics and has
been studied since the era of Nambu and Sugamoto [19, 20, 11]. The relationship between
Takhtajan’s action and the membrane action is analogous to that between the Hamiltonian
formulation of classical mechanics and the Schild action in string theory. Just as the quan-
tization of the Poisson bracket is naturally considered in the Hamiltonian framework when
