of pregnancies, in the sense that positive values of α indicate an asymmetry
of the distribution towards a non-crisis reproductive environment (α →∞+).
In contrast, negative values of α indicate an asymmetry of the distribution
towards a reproductive crisis (α →∞−). The parameter β ∈R is a bifurcation
parameter that switches the number of pregnancies between a reproductive
crisis (β →∞−) and a catastrophic state of fertility (β →∞+) caused by a
catastrophic event. A non-catastrophic state (β < 0) is a state of low fertility.
In contrast, when β →∞+, the model captures the impact of catastrophic
events, which cause severe, unstable, and catastrophic fertility conditions
(Figure 1, right).
Of particular interest are the values of β ∈R0,∞+, which control the
discontinuities in the response surface of the number of pregnancies. Since the
values of β > 0 are related to catastrophic events, estimating the catastrophe
model and testing the statistical significance of the parameters α and β is
equivalent to empirically testing the presence of fertility catastrophic events.
The form of the probability density function of ξ for stochastic catastrophe
models (Equation 5 below) was developed by Cobb (1978, 1981); Cobb et al.
(1983); Cobb and Zacks (1985); Cobb (2010) as a multimodal generalization of
distributions belonging to the exponential family, without relying on mixture
densities (Cobb et al., 1983):
f(ξ; α, β, λ, σ) = ϕ
σ2 exp
α(ξ −λ) + 1
2β(ξ −λ)2 −1
4(ξ −λ)4

In Equation 5, λ and σ are the location and scale parameters of the state
variable ξ, respectively, and ϕ is a constant that normalizes the p.d.f. so
that it has a unit integral over the range R (Cobb, 1981). Estimates of the
parameters of interest α and β can be obtained with information on the number
of pregnancies on the basis of the maximum likelihood approach of Cobb and
Zacks (1985) augmented with the subspace fitting method of Oliva et al. (1987),
in which ξ is a canonical variable that results from a first-order polynomial
approximation of measured dependent variables. Specifically, let Y = [1 | (Yi)],
X = [1 | (Xj)], Z = [1 | (Zk)], and w = (ω0, ω1, . . . , ωp)′, a = (a0, a1, . . . , aq)′,
b = (b0, b1, . . . , br)′. In this notation, Y , X, and Z are vectors that contain
stochastic dynamics variables Y1, Y2, . . . , Yp, X1, X2, . . . , Xq, and Z1, Z2, . . . , Zr,
respectively, and 1 is a vector of ones concatenated in the matrices Y , X, and
Z. Given this matrix notation:
ξ = Y w,
α = Xa,
β = Zb,
