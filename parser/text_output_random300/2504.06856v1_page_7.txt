Figure 4. Qualitative comparison. We synthesized textures for models from the Objaverse dataset using the proposed approach and a number
of recent competing methods. Our method generates seamless textures with softer colors compared with latent diffusion-based approaches.

line that generates only the diffuse map, one of the PBR
components. As shown in Table 2, generating the full set of
PBR maps leads to better FID and KID scores compared to
generating the diffuse map alone. We provide visualization
of PBR maps in Appendix E. Despite better metrics, a closer
study of illustrations indicates that the method occasionally
stuggles with baked-in lighting.
Can our second stage improve other methods? We hy-
pothesize that our second stage in the PBR texture generation
pipeline can improve the results of other texture synthesis
methods. To validate this, we experiment with applying our
second stage to well-initialized diffuse maps from another
method.
As shown in Table 3, our second stage can effectively
generate PBR textures when initialized with diffuse maps
from Text2Tex. We explore two configurations: (1) where
we keep the initial diffuse map fixed (kd frozen) and (2)
where we fine-tune the diffuse map during PBR generation
(kd trained).
The results show that when the diffuse map is kept frozen,
the FID score remains unchanged with a slight increase in
KID. This may be because freezing kd also preserves any
baked lighting information present in the initial diffuse map,
preventing our method from correcting for these lighting
