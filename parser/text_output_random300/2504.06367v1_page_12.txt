as the opposing effects of patchy reionization and resolution
correction counterbalance each other. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this approach represents the most comprehensive level
of modeling. Investigating a cosmology-dependent resolution
correction, alongside other effects including peculiar velocity
[46], will improve our understanding of the recovered bounds
for each mass bin in the context of CWDM models. This is
particularly crucial in the regime 𝑘> 0.1 km−1s, where the
sensitivity to dark matter free-streaming is the highest.

Comparison to previous CWDM analyses
The main results of this work are shown in Figure 11. A
thermal relic as light as 𝑚WDM = 1 keV is allowed by the
data if it contributes < 16% at 2𝜎to the total dark matter
energy density, with increasing 𝑓WDM for increasing mass.
The pure WDM limit in the default analysis results in a 𝑚WDM
> 5.47 keV (2𝜎), which is slightly weaker than the mass bound
found by [46]. However, within our set of analyses we also
recover the 𝑚WDM > 5.86 keV (2𝜎) constraints (Table II).
These lower bounds are highly sensitive to the modeling of
𝑃F (𝑘), including the corrections described in Subsection III C
and III D. Moreover, incorporating 𝑓WDM into the −→𝜃model
parameters requires sampling a higher-dimensional parameter
space during MCMC compared to [46]. This introduces non-
trivial degeneracies, particularly the one illustrated in Figure 6,
which requires a substantial number of samples to achieve
convergence. Notably, the quoted limits have been derived by
filtering the original samples from CWDM runs, in contrast to
fixed mass bin analyses conducted for axions [116, 117]. A
similar degeneracy between the fraction and the axion mass
has been observed also in previous work based on simulations
of mixed dark matter [118], with updated constraints by [62]
using the same Lyman-𝛼data from [69] as in this work. The
degeneracy in the context of CWDM models, however, appears
in the keV mass range.
The main two analyses carried out in the context of Lyman-𝛼
CWDM constraints are [52, 83]. The former found constraints
on thermal relics that are significantly weaker. The constraints
found in the main analysis of the former are weaker, allowing
the smallest thermal-relic mass probed, 𝑚WDM = 1.1 keV, for
𝑓WDM < 40%, with the pure WDM limit 𝑚WDM ≥1.7 keV
(95% C.L.). These constraints are not competitive with the
results presented in Figure 6 mainly due to the lower resolution
of the data used (SDSS and the VISTA Hemisphere Survey
with 𝑘max = 0.03 km−1s).
[83] analysed BOSS DR9 data combined with XQ-100,
HIRES, and MIKE, finding 𝑚WDM > 0.7 keV for 𝑓WDM <
0.10. Their 𝑚WDM bound falls outside our simulation grid in
the ( 𝑓WDM – 𝑚−1
WDM) plane. Their power-law fit to the pos-
terior in this plane, given by 𝑓WDM = 𝐴× (1keV/𝑚WDM)𝑏,
yielded the same 𝐴value but smaller 𝑏compared to the fit
described in Section V. This yields an inflated posterior for
𝑓WDM →1 (larger 𝛼), leading to weaker WDM constraints,
which declines more steeply, with 𝑓WDM ≤0.17 at 𝑚WDM = 1
keV, almost identical to our constraints. Compared to [83],
the work presented in this paper uses improved simulations
that vary thermal history for all the CWDM models consid-
ered. The effects of thermal history are marginalized over a
more physical and conservative prior range than in [83]. This
would weaken the resulting constraint on CWDM models, a
point discussed in previous works [58, 83]. However, the im-
proved resolution (higher 𝑘max) and treatment of systematics
(e.g. noise, metal contamination) in [69] counterbalances this
effect, yielding slightly stronger constraints for these mixed
models.

FIG. 11: Comparison of 2𝜎upper bounds on 𝑓WDM at fixed 𝑚WDM
bins.
The results by [83] show that, as 𝑚WDM−1 increases, the
1𝜎contour in the ( 𝑓WDM – 𝑚−1
WDM) plane shrinks when using
higher resolution data.
This would in principle mean that
there exists a light thermal relic for which the contour closes,
meaning that Lyman-𝛼forest data would be able to completely
exclude CWDM models beyond a 𝑚WDM value.
In our analysis, however, we use data that reaches to higher
