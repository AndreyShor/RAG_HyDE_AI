Figure 2.4: Relative distance of the product of two opposite NNLO EKOs and the identity matrix, in
case of exact inverse and expanded matching (see Eq. (2.4)) when crossing the bottom threshold scale
µb = 4.92 GeV. The plot setting are as in Fig. 2.1.
initial PDF is purely perturbative, it vanishes naturally below the mass threshold scale after
having applied the inverse matching.
2.1.2. Yadism
In this section, we present Yadism, the software library developed for the calculation of DIS
observables. To date, Yadism has already been used in various papers. Specifically, it has been
used to evaluate neutrino structure functions in Refs. [15, 124], and to compute of polarized
structure functions in Ref. [12] (cf. Chapter 5). Furthermore, Yadism has been adopted by the
NNPDF collaboration, who has used it in their most recent papers [11, 6, 3] (cf. Chapters 3
and 4). We refer to [7] for a more extensive presentation.
Yadism differs from other QCD codes such as APFEL [118], APFEL++ [125], HOPPET [126], and
Qcdnum [127] in several ways.
Yadism includes most of the currently available results in literature, specifically it allows for
the computation of polarized and unpolarized structure functions up to N3LO in QCD (cf.
Section 4.2.1). Thanks to its modular design, the library can be easily extended as the results of
new computations become available.
Yadism provides both renormalization and factorization scale variations consistently [6] and
both can be implemented at any order. The currently implemented coefficients allow performing
renormalization scale variations up to N3LO and factorization scale variations up to NNLO.
Instead, N3LO factorization scale variations can be included through the EKO evolution code
(Section 2.1.1).
Yadism can, together with EKO, be used to construct general-mass variable flavor number
schemes using coexisting PDFs with different numbers of active flavors [5]. This can avoid
the perturbative expansion of the evolution kernel as is done in the construction of the FONLL
scheme [107].
