Proposition 5.8. Let (tij)i,j be the associated charge transporters. We then have tije = etij.
Proof. Consider the matrices
C = [ti′je −eti′j]i′,j ∈Mn(B1),
D = [t∗
ij]j,i ∈Mn(A)
and the row vector V = [ξ1
i′]i′.
We ﬁrst claim V CD = 0, which means
X
i′,j
ξ1
i′ ⊗[ti′,j, e]t∗
ij = 0
for all i. By Proposition 2.9, this can be written as
βB1,XβX,B1(ξ1
i ⊗e) −
X
i′,j
ξ1
i′ ⊗eti′jt∗
ij.
The ﬁrst terms is equal to ξ1
i ⊗e by our assumption. As for the second term, after summation
over j, on the right of tensor symbol Proposition 2.7 gives ep(1)
i′i . Since p = ⟨ξ1
i′|ξ1
i ⟩commutes
with e, we have
ξ1
i′pi′i ⊗e = ξ1
i ⊗e,
which indeed has the claimed cancellation.
Next, we claim that the matrix D∗= [tij]i,j satisﬁes CDD∗= C, which will then imply
V C = 0. Using Proposition 2.8 and the commutation of e and p(2)
jk , we compute the components
of CDD∗as
X
i,j
[ti′j, e]t∗
ijtik =
X
j
[ti′j, e]p(2)
jk = [ti′k, e],
which are indeed the components of C.
Now we are ready to get the claim. Let us ﬁx i and j, and take any vector η in the bimodule
B1. The vanishing of V C means
X
i′
ξ1
i′ ⊗[ti′j, e] = 0.
If we write out the inner product of the left hand side with ξi ⊗η, we get
X
i′
⟨ξ1
i ⊗η|ξ1
i′ ⊗[ti′j, e]⟩=
X
i′
⟨η| ⟨ξ1
i |ξ1
i′⟩(ti′je −eti′j)⟩=
X
i′
⟨η|p(1)
ii′ (ti′je −eti′j)⟩.
Again using the commutation of P1 with e and Proposition 2.7, we obtain ⟨η|[tij, e]⟩= 0. Since
this must be 0 for arbitrary η, we get the vanishing of tije −etij.
□
Remark 5.9. Morally speaking, if X has trivial monodromy with B1, the charge transporters
of X cannot interact with the observables sitting at the “gap” 0 ∈Z separating the regions F1
and F2. This should be a property characterizing the vacuum state.
Corollary 5.10. We have tij ∈B0.
Proof. We have etije = E(tij)e from the characterzing condition of e, while the above propo-
sition implies etije = tije2 = tije. Since a 7→ae is an injective linear map from A to B1, we
obtain the claim.
□
The next proposition is an analogue of Proposition 3.1.
Proposition 5.11. Let X be in the M¨uger center of DHR(A•). Under Conditions 4.10 and 5.6,
X has a nonzero B0-central vector.
