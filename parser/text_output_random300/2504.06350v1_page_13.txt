Using Jordan’s lemma, one can decompose the Bell operator as ˆβ = L
i ˆβi, where each ˆβi acts on
a two-dimensional subspace.
This decomposition implies that self-testing is independent of the local
Hilbert space dimensions dim B(HA) and dim B(HB), being invariant under local isometries ΦA⊗ΦB that
preserve physical predictions. This leads to the so-called qubit reduction argument, a key security feature
of device-independent QKD: although the actual devices may operate in high-dimensional spaces, only
two-dimensional subspaces contribute to the Bell inequality violation. Suppose the state decomposes as
ρ = L
i piρi, then the observed value is β = Tr(ρˆβ) = P
i pi⟨ˆβi⟩. Each ˆβi is bounded above by Tsirelson’s
bound 2
√
2. If ρ is entirely supported on the block achieving this bound, the full violation is maximal.
Otherwise, contributions from blocks with lower eigenvalues reduce the total violation. This dilution
effect makes the security proof robust against dimension attacks, where an adversary might try to hide
extra information in higher-dimensional components (see Sec. 1.3.2). Consequently, the derivation of
bounds on the adversary’s information—such as bounding the guessing probability from the observed
Bell violation—becomes independent of the internal structure of the devices, which can be treated as
black boxes. The existence of a map Σ : p 7→R (via Jordan’s lemma) is sufficient to certify private
randomness extraction. Specifically, condition (18) implies:
σAE =

BE, and pA(a|x) = P
b p(a, b|x, y) is Alice’s marginal. Thus, Al-
ice’s outcomes are completely random from Eve’s perspective [72], and for any correlation satisfying
condition (18), one may optimize over Bob’s measurements accordingly. A comprehensive review of self-
testing is given in [134], and a geometric characterization of self-testing via nonlocal extremal points p
is presented in [125]. In the next section, we examine how to account for experimental imperfections in
Bell tests.
2.4. Experimental Loopholes
Experimental validation that p ∈Q \ L requires careful treatment of imperfections in Bell tests. Such
imperfections—typically due to transmission losses, detector inefficiencies, or other technical limita-
tions—can open loopholes that allow an LHV model to reproduce data that would otherwise appear
nonlocal. These loopholes undermine the assumption that the observed statistics p truly violate the
causal constraints illustrated in Fig.5a [140, 141]. Although this may seem like a conspiratorial behavior
of nature, in practice, an adversary could exploit such loopholes to forge fake BI violations using only
classical resources [142], potentially compromising device-independent cryptographic protocols. Below,
we briefly summarize the main loopholes (see Refs. [140, 141] for a detailed discussion).
2.4.1. Detection Efficiency Loophole
Consider the ideal scenario depicted in Fig.2a, where the behavior p = {p(ab|xy)} satisfies β(p) = 2

as in Eq. (11). Detection is illustrated as “eyes” observing which lamp turns on, but in reality, it involves
two detectors that click with respective probabilities ηA, ηB < 1. For simplicity, let us consider only
Bob’s detector, then he measures only a set D of detected particle from a set E, of emitted particle,
where η = |D|/|E| 7. The most general way of accounting for no-click events is to consider an additional
outcome, which enlarges the Bell scenario8 [143, 144]. As a results, characterizing the sets L and Q
becomes considerably more complex [145, 146, 55]. To remain in the same Bell scenario, Bob fixes an
outcome b to assign at each no-click event with probability qB(b|y).
Similarly, Alice assigns a with
probability qA(a|x) 9.
An affine map ˆp = ΩηAηB(p) = {ˆp(ab|xy)} describes the events of both the
detectors: both, only one, or none of them click with related probabilities ηAηB, ηA(1−ηB) or (1−ηA)ηB,
and (1 −ηA)(1 −ηB), such that
ˆp(ab|xy) = ηAηBp(ab|xy)+ηA(1 −ηB)pA(a|x)qB(b|y) + (1 −ηA)ηBqA(a|x)pB(b|y)
+(1 −ηA)(1 −ηB)qA(a|x)qB(b|y).

7Here η is the probability that a photon emitted by the source is indeed detected. A discussion on the experimental
parameters that contribute to η is provided in 6.2.
8This approach can be used to describe null events for analyzers with a number of outcomes that span the space associated
to the degree of freedom of interest, such as two-outcome polarizing beam splitters, for example.
9This approach is best suited for experiments using “pass/fail” measurement devices, such as a polarization filter, where
one cannot distinguish a null event from a projection onto the state that does not pass through the filter.
