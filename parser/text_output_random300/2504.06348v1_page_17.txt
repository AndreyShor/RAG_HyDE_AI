with pmax
α
∈Z denoting the electronic momentum cutoff. Similarly, we label the nuclear momentum eigen-
states by P = (P1, P2, P3), where each Pα ∈Z lives in the set
Gα := [−P max
α
, P max
α
],
G = ¯G1 × G2 × G3,
(18)
with P max
α
∈N denoting the nuclear momentum cutoff.
The integer labels p, P index the electron and ion momentum eigenvalues kp, KP given by
kp =
3
X
α=1
pαbα,
KP =

X
α=1
Pαbα,
(19)
where bα are the reciprocal lattice vectors along directions α = 1, 2, 3, that define the full computational
reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal lattice vectors {bα} are constructed from the real-space lattice vectors {aα}:
b1 = 2π
Ωa2 × a3,
b2 = 2π
Ωa3 × a1,
b3 = 2π
Ωa1 × a2,
(20)
where the reciprocal lattice volume is ¯Ω= | det(B)| = (2π)3
Ω, with B as a matrix with columns {bα}3
α=1.
Hence, the simulation takes place in the plane-wave basis labeled by {p}p∈G, {P}P∈G.
The elements of Gα are stored using nα qubits in a signed momentum representation giving the max
value of the momentum integers as pmax
α
= 2nα−1 −1.9 The total number of qubits per electron is therefore
n =
3
X
α=1
nα,
nα = ⌈log2(pmax
α
+ 1)⌉+ 1.
(21)
We choose an approximate maximum momentum Λ, and set each pmax
α
such that10
Λ ≈pmax
α
|bα|,
for α = 1, 2, 3.
(22)
One may choose anisotropic cutoffs, i.e., Λ1, Λ2, Λ3, if desired (as we do in Sec. 2.4). The interaction terms
in the Hamiltonian of interest will involve a momentum exchange that has twice the range of the momentum
values defined in G. For this we define a new set
q ∈G0 := G0
1 × G0
2 × G0
3,
G0
α := [−2pmax
α
, 2pmax
α
]\{0},
(23)
where zero-momentum differences are neglected to avoid singularities in the interaction.
A completely analogous discussion holds for nuclei. We shall repeat it to introduce the relevant notation.
The elements of Gα are stored using nα qubits in a signed momentum representation giving the max value
of the momentum integers as P max
α
= 2¯nα−1 −1. The total number of qubits per nucleus is therefore
¯n =
3
X
α=1
¯nα,
¯nα = ⌈log2(P max
α
+ 1)⌉+ 1.
(24)
Each P max
α
is chosen with the approximate maximum momentum as before,
¯Λ ≈P max
α
|bα|.
(25)
Similarly, the nuclear momentum exchange is given by,
Q ∈¯G0 := ¯G0
1 × ¯G0
2 × ¯G0
3,
¯G0
α := [−2P max
α
, 2P max
α
]\{0},
(26)
9The signed representation has pα = (−1)pα,nα−1 Pnα−2
r=0
2rpα,r where pα,r ∈{0, 1} is the r-th bit of pα. The label pα = −0
indexes an unphysical redundant state not present in Gα. Hence, |Gα| = 2nα −1 = 2pmax
α
+ 1 and |G| = Q3
α=1 |Gα|.
10In practice, we choose Λ and compute pmax
α
= Λ/|bα| which, in general, is a floating point number. Using Eq. (21), we
compute the integer number of qubits and then recompute the integer pmax
α
as shown above Eq. (21). This then gives the
“true” cutoffs, which are in general anisotropic, and larger than Λ due to the ceiling in Eq. (21). When quoting the instances
in Sec. 2.4, we list these true cutoffs.
