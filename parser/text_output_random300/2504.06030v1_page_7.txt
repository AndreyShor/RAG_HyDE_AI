with familiar zeroth order approximations:-
2−1(|∇S|2 −|∇R|2) + V = E,
and
∇R.∇S = 0.
(See NQG I and NQG II, Refs. [28] and [29]).
Assume just for now that the zeroth order approximations are known (R0, S0) and write:
R = R0 + ϵ2R1, S = S0 + ϵ2S0, where R1 and S1 satisfy
∇S0.∇S1 −∇R0.∇R1 = 1

∇S0.∇R1 + ∇R0.∇S1 = −1
