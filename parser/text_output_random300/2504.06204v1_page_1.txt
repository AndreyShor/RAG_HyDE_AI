This study investigates spin squeezed states in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quadrupolar
systems with spins I = 3/2 and I = 7/2 at room temperature, taking into account the effects of
relaxation on the dynamics. The origin of spin squeezing is attributed to the interaction between
the nuclear quadrupole moment and the electric field gradients in the molecular environment. The
formal description of the nonlinear operators responsible for spin squeezing is achieved using the spin
angular momentum representation via the one-axis twisting mechanism. This approach provides a
framework for quantum control and metrology over the spin squeezing process while accounting for
the influence of relaxation phenomena. Non-Cartesian angular momentum operators are proposed,
with their variance products catching the quantum effects during the dynamics. An upper bound for
the squeezing parameter and the Heisenberg uncertainty at thermal equilibrium are also predicted
for any spin quantum number.

INTRODUCTION
Spin squeezing is a fundamental concept in quantum
mechanics with broad applications in quantum technolo-
gies, including quantum computing, quantum control,
quantum sensing, entanglement generation, and preci-
sion metrology [1–9].
It provides a key resource for
quantum-enhanced measurements, enabling sensitivities
that surpass the standard quantum limit and approach
the Heisenberg limit. However, the practical implemen-
tation of spin squeezing is constrained by decoherence
mechanisms, which arise from environmental interac-
tions, spontaneous emission, and other noise sources. Un-
derstanding the interplay between spin squeezing and de-
coherence is thus crucial to advance quantum-enhanced
metrology and quantum information processing.
The impact of decoherence on spin squeezing has been
extensively investigated in various physical systems. No-
table examples include cold atomic ensembles manipu-
lated by Ramsey spectroscopy [10], spin-1/2 ensembles
subject to different decoherence channels [11], spin net-
works coupled to a critical quantum environment [12],
and Bose–Einstein condensates [13]. Additional studies
have examined cold-confined atoms that interact disper-
sively with a paraxial laser beam, where both coher-
ent scattering and decoherence due to diffuse scatter-
ing are considered [14]. Further investigations have ex-
plored long-lived dipolar atomic arrays undergoing collec-
tive emission [15] and optomechanical systems coupled to
single photons [16]. These studies provide insights into
how decoherence affects quantum correlations and im-
poses limits on the performance of quantum-enhanced
protocols.
Since real physical systems are inherently subject to re-
laxation effects, a detailed understanding of decoherence

is necessary for developing robust quantum control tech-
niques. In this work, we analyze the impact of relaxation-
induced decoherence on spin squeezing, focusing on its
implications for quantum control strategies. The evolu-
tion of the elements of the density matrix elements is
described using the master equations that accounts for
the dissipation of coherences and populations due to re-
laxation processes. Specifically, we study the dynamics of
spin squeezing in a one-axis twisting model composed of
quadrupolar spin-3/2 and spin-7/2 particles coupled to a
Markovian environment in high-temperature regime. By
characterizing the effects of relaxation on spin squeezing,
our results provide a quantitative framework for assessing
the feasibility of quantum-enhanced metrology under re-
alistic conditions. This study contributes to the broader
understanding of spin squeezing in dissipative quantum
systems and offers insights relevant to experimental im-
plementations in nuclear magnetic resonance.
This work is structured as follows.
Sections II and
III provide a brief introduction to the formalisms of spin
squeezing and relaxation, respectively. The relationship
between these concepts is explored in Section IV. In Sec-
tion V, the Heisenberg uncertainty is analyzed within
the spin framework, and a new pair of angular momen-
tum operators is proposed, with their uncertainty rela-
tion catching quantum coherences throughout the system
dynamics. Section VI establishes an upper bound for the
squeezing parameter and the Heisenberg uncertainty at
thermal equilibrium for arbitrary spin quantum numbers.
Finally, our main conclusions are summarized in Section
VII.
