Gen Mvar columns, which denote generated megawatts and megavolt-amperes reactive.
Substations without generation output are identified as transmission substations.
‚Ä¢ Branches data: Table 3 shows the branch information of selected substations in the 500-bus
case. It lists all transmission lines between two substations. Our tool uses this file to connect
transmission and generation substations in the radial topology.
While the CSV file also has load information in megawatts, the proposed model does not currently
use this information. However, it shows that future distribution substations can also be created to
be included in the cyber-physical model.
4.2
Creation of the cyber-network model
The code starts by reading user inputs from the settings.ini file, which has parameters such as the
number of UCCs, the number of BAs, the name of the synthetic power system, and the topology
(e.g., star, radial, or statistical).
Once these configuration parameters are defined, the process follows the steps in Fig. 5: cluster
substation into utilities, generate cyber components, convert data to JSON, and visualize network
maps and metrics using NetworkX. These steps are described in detail next. Algorithms 1 and 2
show the pseudocode to create substations, UCCs, and BAs.
4.2.1
Cluster Substations into Utilities. Substations are allocated to UCCs using a ùëò-means
clustering algorithm, with ùëÅrepresenting the number of utilities specified by the user in the
settings.ini file. The centroids of these clusters determine the placement of UCCs within star and
