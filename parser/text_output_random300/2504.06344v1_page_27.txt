Wilson loops evaluated at the origin of the lattice for 214 configurations of Figure 6
on a lattice of size (32,8,8,8) corresponding to ∆(2, 1, 2) = 0. Data points are plotted in blue, the
averages are plotted as orange crosses, and the solid boundary is the same as that plotted in Figure
4, corresponding to turning on only the translational moduli of the constant-F solution.
constant moduli which are absorbed in ¯A. The substitution (4.7) is understood to be made
in the expressions for Wµ read off from eqn. (4.5) and can be trusted only for small values of
the noncompact modulus η.
Using (4.8), with (4.5) and (4.7), as well as the expressions from [1], the computation of
[F13F13] is consistent26 to O(λ0), and its integral over the 2-4 plane of the torus is given by

26This is similar to section 5, where we compare the ∆-expansion to numerics. The point is that, as in
the ∆-expansion, gauge invariants of the form tr F 2
12, with two indices in a plane of nonzero twist receive
contributions to leading order also from components S(1), for which a formal expression can be written, but
which are difficult to compute explicitly. This is discussed in Appendix C of [1].
