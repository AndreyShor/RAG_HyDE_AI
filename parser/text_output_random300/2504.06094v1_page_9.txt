Let (ξ1
i )i and (ξ2
j )j be two bases of X as above, and let us check that they generate the
same A−-module. Consider the charge transporters tij = ⟨ξ1
i |ξ2
j ⟩. By the support condition
tij commutes with A[−R−1,∞), hence belongs to A−. This implies that the right A−-module
generated by the vectors ξ1
i contains the one generated by the ξ2
j . By symmetry we have the
converse inclusion.

Deﬁnition 4.2. We deﬁne F−to be the functor DHR(A•) →Corr(A−) given by X 7→X−.
Proposition 4.3. The functor F−: DHR(A•) →Corr(A−) is endowed with the structure of a
monoidal functor.
Proof. Let us ﬁx DHR bimodules X, Y ∈DHR(A•). Take respective projective basis (ξi)i and
(ηj)j localized in subsets of (−∞, −1], far enough from −1 as above. On one hand, they become
bases for X−and Y−. On the other the vectors (ξi ⊗ηj)i,j form a projective basis in X ⊠A Y .
Thus, we have a well-deﬁned isomorphism of Hilbert modules (X ⊠A Y )−→X−⊠A−Y−
characterized by
(ξi ⊗ηj)a 7→ξi ⊗ηja
(a ∈A−).
It is routine to check that this is a natural isomorphism of bifunctors required for the structure
of monoidal functors.
□
As a consequence, the objects X−form a C∗-tensor subcategory of Corr(A−). Let us take
the idempotent completion of this category.
Deﬁnition 4.4. We deﬁne C−as the full C∗-tensor subcategory of Corr(A−) whose objects are
the subobjects of A−-correspondences of the form X−for a DHR bimodule X.
In the same way, we deﬁne X+ ∈Corr(A+) for X ∈DHR(A•), and deﬁne C+ as the idempo-
tent completion of the image of the induced tensor functor F+ : DHR(A•) →Corr(A+). Under
Condition 2.5, C± has a simple unit. We tacitly assume this condition in the following.
Let us record several auxiliary results that we will use later.
Proposition 4.5. Given X ∈DHR(A•), we have a natural isomorphism of Hilbert A-modules
X−⊠A−A ≃X,
ξ ⊗a 7→ξa.
Proof. This follows from the fact that, if (ξi)i is a basis of X localized in a negative interval far
enough from −1 as above, then it is also an A−-basis of X−.
□
Proposition 4.6. Let R, L be as in Proposition 4.1, and let T : X−→Y−be a homomorphism
of Hilbert A−-bimodules. Take bases (ξi)i ⊂X and (ηj)j ⊂Y that are localized in the interval
[−a, −R −L −1]. Then we have ⟨ηj|T(ξi)⟩∈A[−(a+R),−1].
Proof. By assumption ξi is central for A(−∞,−(a+1)] ⊗A[0,∞), hence T(ξi) has the same property,
and the same holds for ⟨ηj|T(ξi)⟩. We also know that ⟨ηj|T(ξi)⟩belongs to A−. We then have
⟨ηj|T(ξi)⟩∈A[−(a+R),R−1] ∩A−,
hence the claim.
□
Remark 4.7. If (ξi)i is localized in [−a, −b], then the vector ξ′
i = T(ξi) is central for the algebra
A(−∞,−(a+1)] ⊗A[−(b−1),−1] since T is an A−-bimodule homomorphism. Moreover, ξ′
i is also
central for A[0,∞), since the target of T is Y−. But we still don’t have the commutation with
A[−c,d] for c, d > 0, which prevents us from concluding ⟨ηj|T(ξi)⟩∈A[−(a+K),−(b−K)]. (Of course,
this would be true for A-bimodule homomorphisms.)
