at approximately 15 mK, as monitored by a ther-
mometer attached to it.
A copper sample holder
is mounted on the XYZ piezoelectric nanopositioners
(ANPx101/RES/LT×2, ANPz101/RES/LT, Attocube)
via a thermal link. These positioners are used for coarse
alignment of the sample with a CCD camera. The sam-
ple’s surface is identified as the position where the re-
flected spot image on the CCD camera is minimized.
Relatively large structures, such as the waveguide, can be
distinguished in the CCD image, whereas the nanowire
cannot be resolved.
The optical system is configured as follows. A 515-nm
laser (Cobolt, Hubner Photonics) is used for the laser ir-
radiation experiments. The laser is scanned over the sam-
ple using a two-axis galvanometer mirror (GVS202, Thor-
labs). Two lenses are inserted between the galvanome-
ter mirror and the objective lens (LT-APO/VISIR/0.82,
Attocube) to form a 4-f system, which maximizes the
microscope’s field of view.
The laser, focused by the
objective lens, is directed onto the surface of the sam-
ple. Since laser irradiation around the resonator mod-
ulates the microwave transmission spectrum, changes in
the spectrum allow us to roughly estimate the focusing
position while moving the piezo-positioner. After roughly
locating the corners of the resonator, we acquire a laser-
scanning microwave transmission spectrum map to deter-
mine the precise position for subsequent laser-irradiation
experiments.
The microwave setup is configured as follows. A vec-
tor network analyzer (VNA) (P9373A, Keysight) is used
to measure the transmission spectrum (S21) of the res-
onator. The probe microwave is attenuated by a total
of 52 dB. The input power is calculated considering the
output power from VNA and the 52-dB attenuation, and
the finite cable loss is not calibrated. The probe signal
transmitted through the sample is then amplified by a
high-electron mobility-transistor (HEMT) amplifier and
a room-temperature amplifier before being detected by
the VNA. Here, we insert two circulators between the
HEMT and the resonator.
