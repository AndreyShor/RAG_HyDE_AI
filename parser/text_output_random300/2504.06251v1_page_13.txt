Fig. 4 | Stronger flat band in the aligned R5G/BN sample as compared to the non-aligned
sample. a,b, Dispersion images of aligned R5G/BN sample (S1) measured parallel to Î“-K direc-
tion (indicated by vertical lines in l). c,d, Similar data to a,b measured on non-aligned R5G/BN
sample (S3). e, Comparison of EDCs on aligned and non-aligned samples, obtained by integrating
over boxes marked in b and d. f-h, Dispersion images measured along momentum cuts indicated
by horizontal lines in l on aligned sample S1. i-k, Dispersion images measured along momentum
cuts in m on non-aligned sample S3. l,m, EDC analysis for the aligned and non-aligned samples,
respectively. The EDCs are extracted from momentum range of k1 to k17 as indicated by black
ticks in (g,j). Red dots in (g,j,l,m) indicate the extracted dispersion with the color and size repre-
senting the peak intensity.
