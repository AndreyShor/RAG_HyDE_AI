 The symmetry analysis of the optical vibrational modes (see Table 6) gave for 2-AmpH2PO3 
11A(IR,Ra) + 10B(IR,Ra) representations for the external modes and 45A(IR,Ra) + 45B(IR,Ra) 
representations for the internal modes; 12Ag(IR,Ra) + 11Au(IR,Ra) + 12Bg(IR,Ra) + 
10Bu(IR,Ra) representations for the external modes and 45Ag(IR,Ra) + 45Au(IR,Ra) + 
45Bg(IR,Ra) + 45Bu(IR,Ra) representations for the internal modes for both polymorphs of 2-
AmpHSO4; 24Ag(IR,Ra) + 23Au(IR,Ra) + 24Bg(IR,Ra) + 22Bu(IR,Ra) for the external modes 
and 78Ag(IR,Ra) + 78Au(IR,Ra) + 78Bg(IR,Ra) + 78Bu(IR,Ra) for the internal modes for (2-
Amp)2SO4H2O.  
 
3.3.1. Vibrational bands associated with hydrogen bonds 
 The broad strong to medium-intensity bands (ranging from 3400 to 2400 cm-1) in the IR 
spectrum of 2-AmpH2PO3 were assigned to the stretching modes of NH groups participating 
in the hydrogen bonds of the N-H...O type (donor-acceptor distances of 2.629(3)-2.896(3) Å). 
Structured medium-intensity IR bands in the 2900-1800 cm-1 region are related to the stretching 
vibrations of OH groups involved in O-H…O hydrogen bonds interconnecting anions with a 
donor-acceptor distance of 2.572(2) Å. These manifestations form characteristic “ABC bands” 
with the main maxima at 2550 cm-1 (“A band”), 2280 cm-1 (“B band”) and 1930 cm-1 (“C 
band”). The “ABC bands” were previously observed in the IR spectra of several hydrogen-
bonded systems (including hydrogen phosphites – see refs. [56, 62]), and their explanation 
continues to attract the attention of spectroscopists (see e.g., refs. [63, 64]).  
 The manifestations of the NH stretching modes related to N-H...O hydrogen bonds in the 
crystal structure of 2-AmpHSO4 (I) (donor-acceptor distances of 2.702(2)-3.009(2) Å) were 
recorded as strong to medium-intensity IR bands in the 3400-2100 cm-1 region. The bands of 
stretching vibrations of OH groups involved in O-H…N hydrogen bonds (donor-acceptor 
distance of 2.652(2) Å) can be expected in the 3100-2900 cm-1 region. 
 Structured medium-intensity bands recorded in the IR spectrum of 2-AmpHSO4 (II) in the 
3450-2300 cm-1 region correspond to the stretching modes of NH groups participating in the 
hydrogen bonds of the N-H...O type (donor-acceptor distances of 2.748(1)-3.167(2) Å). The 
presence of N-H…N hydrogen bonds with a donor-acceptor distance of 2.999(2) Å is reflected 
by the bands of stretching NH modes located in the 3450-3100 cm-1 region. The vibrational 
bands of OH groups involved in O-H…O hydrogen bonds interconnecting anions with donor-
acceptor distance of 2.591(1) Å were recorded in the 2900-2300 cm-1 region. 
 The broad strong to medium-intensity bands ranging from 3400 to 2200 cm-1 in the IR
