FIG. 9. Data and simulation for recurrence Z2B and X2B on qubits (0,1,2,3) of ibm kyiv. Solid lines are simulations assuming
reported noise parameters as described in Table. III and IV of App. E. Additional plots in App. H, Fig. 16 and 17
does not indicate consistent improvement in Bell fidelity
with distillation. To get improvements we notice (see Ta-
ble III in App. E) that, in general, the dominant source of
noise on the qubits under consideration is T2 noise (i.e.,
Z errors) while the ZB2 catches T1 noise, i.e., X and
amplitude damping type errors.
The X2B distillation protocol catches Z errors. Re-
sults from implementing this protocol in both simulation
and experiment is given in Fig. 9b. In this figure, there
is reasonable agreement between the experimental data
and numerical simulations. In addition, notice there is
general improvement in Bell fidelity, indicating that the
likely dominant source of T2 errors are caught by X2B
recurrence. Improvements are not seen for higher Bell
fidelities. This likely occurs due to both measurement
errors and asymmetry in Bell fidelities of the two Bell
pairs being distilled. The former are not removed by dis-
tillation while the latter generally shrink the noise region
where distillation shows improvement. In specific cases
simulations indicate that lowering measurement errors to
zero can allow distillation to give improvements even for
high fidelity Bell pairs.

Three Bell distillation experiment with idle
noise
Using the same technique for experiment and num-
bers as in the previous sections we extend the experi-
ment to the three Bell (ZX3B) protocol (circuit avail-
able in App. G, Fig. 14) and results of this are shown in
Figs. 10. Again, we get reasonable agreement with the
numerics using just the backend calibration parameters.
We see two cases, in the first (see Fig. 10a) we have small
acceptance ratio and no real improvement in the Bell
state; here the noise parameters are quite large. In the
