S2 adiabatic population
Figure 4. Comparison of exact quantum dynamics, thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics (TGED), and Ehrenfest dynamics
near a conical intersection of electronic states of the same symmetry. The real part of the nuclear wavepackets is shown in
shades of blue when negative and red when positive. The adiabatic population of the S2 electronic state is color-coded on the
trajectory of the position expectation value.
corresponding adiabatic potential surfaces defining the
conical intersections, which are marked by a cross. As-
suming an initial photoexcitation from the equilibrium
position q0 to the excited state S2, the peaked and sloped
conical intersections are expected to induce significantly
different dynamics. In the first case, the nuclei are pushed
directly in the direction of the intersection, which is why
peaked conical intersections tend to facilitate population
transfer between adiabatic states48. However, a classi-
cal trajectory would remain on the straight line Qc = 0,
where the diabatic coupling is zero, thus preventing pop-
ulation transfer to other electronic states when using
single-trajectory mean-field methods, as observed in the
case of pyrazine in Sec. III B. In contrast, for electronic
states of the same symmetry, the force on the nuclei can
have nonzero components along both nuclear coordinates
Qt and Qc. Consequently, the nuclei do not pass directly
through, but close to the conical intersection, and acti-
vation of the Qc mode can induce electronic transitions.
It is important to note that the failure of Ehrenfest
dynamics is not just an artifact of the diabatic repre-
sentation. The adiabatic Hamiltonian can be expressed
as
ˆHad =
1
2M [ˆp21−2iℏFad(ˆq)·ˆp−ℏ2Gad(ˆq)]+Vad(ˆq) (24)
where Fad is an S × S matrix of nonadiabatic coupling
vectors, Vad is the diagonal adiabatic potential energy
matrix and Gad is an S × S matrix of scalar nonadia-
batic couplings [some researchers only take the diagonal
part, called the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction
(DBOC)49]. Even when the off-diagonal components of
Gad are neglected, the term Fad(ˆq) · ˆp couples the adia-
batic electronic states, enabling population transfer be-
tween them. Figure 3(a) indicates that this scalar prod-
uct is initially zero for single-trajectory mean-field meth-
ods in the case of a conical intersection between elec-
tronic states of different symmetry, as [Fad]12, which is
parallel to the Qc = 0 axis, is orthogonal to the momen-
tum p (which is parallel to the Qt = 0 axis). Approach-
ing the conical intersection, the nonzero component of
[Fad]12 diverges but the scalar product with p remains
zero.
However, at the intersection itself, the compo-
nent of [Fad]12 along Qt takes the indeterminate form
0
0, which could lead to numerical instability50. In con-
