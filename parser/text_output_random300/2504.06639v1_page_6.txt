While the high-temperature rates (T > 105 K) may not
have significant practical relevance, they are included for
completeness. At high temperatures T, the DR rate co-
efficient decreases following a ∼T −3/2 dependence, as
the increasing kinetic energy of free electrons reduces the
probability of recombination. In contrast, at low temper-
atures, the DR process is predominantly influenced by a
number of resonances situated just above the threshold.
These resonances contribute significantly to the recom-
bination rate, ensuring that DR remains efficient even at
lower temperatures. This occurs because the ∼T −3/2
factor compensates for the lowness of the temperature.
The calculated values have an estimated uncertainty of
at least 38%, determined using the error propagation rule
from Eq. 10. At low temperatures, DR is primarily gov-
erned by near-zero-energy resonances, where the energy
of free electrons closely matches the energy levels of states
within the ion, enabling highly efficient recombination
processes. The dominance of these resonances enhances
the recombination probability, significantly influencing
the ionization balance of the kilonova ejecta. Notably,
the behavior of DR at these temperatures can resemble
radiative recombination, highlighting the need for precise
resonance data for accurate modeling. As the tempera-
ture increases, contributions from high-n Rydberg states
become more prominent. These states, with their highly
excited electrons near the ionization threshold, play a
crucial role in recombination dynamics at higher tem-
peratures. The interplay between the thermal energy of
the electrons and the populations of these excited states
alters the overall recombination efficiency, resulting in a
shift in the effective ionization balance. This shift is par-
ticularly significant for ions with one or two electrons out-
side closed shells (e.g., Y+, Sr+, and Ce2+), as it impacts
the interpretation of kilonova spectra and the modeling
of non-LTE plasmas [7].

Among the studied ions, Ce2+ exhibits relatively high
DR rate coefficients at very low temperatures compared
to the other ions. In the kilonova-relevant temperature
range (∼104 K), as shown in Table I, the rate coeffi-
cients for Y+ and Ce2+ become comparable and signifi-
cantly exceed those of Sr+ and Te2+. This indicates that
Y+ and Ce2+ have a stronger tendency to populate lower
ionization states over time, while Sr+ and Te2+ remain
ionized for a longer duration in the expanding ejecta.
These DR trends have critical implications for kilonova
spectra. Higher DR rates, as seen for Y+ and Ce2+, are
expected to promote efficient recombination to lower ion-
ization states, contributing to optical and near-infrared

spectral features. In contrast, the slower recombination
associated with Sr+ and Te2+ can lead to the retention of
higher ionization states, producing spectral features char-
acterized by higher-energy transitions and shifts toward
shorter wavelengths. The availability of these computed
DR rates will be instrumental in refining spectral mod-
els, improving predictions of line emission, and enhancing
our understanding of kilonova ejecta composition, as they
provide crucial inputs for astrophysical modeling tools
like the SUMO spectral synthesis code used in kilonovae
simulations [47].
In Figure 6, a comparison is made between the DR
rate coefficients obtained in this work and those reported
in the only existing study over the temperature range
characteristic of the nebular phase of kilonovae. During
this phase, the temperature is typically around 10,000 K
[48, 49]. To account for the temperature evolution from
the early weeks after the event to later stages, influenced
by the evolving ejecta composition, the rate coefficients
are presented across a broader temperature range from
1,000 K to 30,000 K.
In the case of Y+, the present values are approximately
an order of magnitude larger than those reported by
Banerjee et al. [36]. The same number of intermediate
states has been considered in both studies; however, the
difference in magnitude arises from the inclusion of a sig-
nificantly larger number of Rydberg states in the present
work. The inclusion of high-n Rydberg states enhances
the recombination probability [50]. Additionally, differ-
ences in the number of orbital angular momentum states
(l) considered in the two studies may further contribute
to the observed discrepancy in the rate coefficients.
A different trend is observed for Sr+, where the present
results show good agreement with those of Banerjee et
al. [36]. This consistency can be attributed to the in-
clusion of an additional 4p64f state in their study, which
