The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) captures the variations of quantum states with parameters,
serving as a central concept in modern quantum physics. Its real part, the quantum Fisher informa-
tion matrix (QFIM), has a measurement-dependent counterpart that links statistics to distinguisha-
bility. However, an analogous extension for the QGT is hindered by the fundamental inaccessibility
of its imaginary part through measurement probabilities. Here we introduce a counterpart to the
QGT that includes measurement operators, termed the semi-classical geometric tensor (SCGT). We
show that the SCGT provides a lower bound to the QGT that is tight for pure states. Moreover,
we use the SCGT to derive sharp multiparameter information bounds and discuss extensions of the
Berry phase.
Introduction.— The geometric properties of quantum
states play a fundamental role in understanding physical
phenomena at the heart of modern physics and technol-
ogy. A central concept is the quantum geometric tensor
(QGT) [1, 2]. For a pure state |ψθ⟩parameterized by
m variables θ = (θ1, . . . , θm), the QGT is deﬁned as the
Hermitian and positive-semideﬁnite matrix Q(|ψθ⟩) with
elements
[Q(|ψθ⟩)]ij = 4 ⟨∂iψθ|(1 −|ψθ⟩⟨ψθ|)|∂jψθ⟩,
(1)
where |∂iψθ⟩≡∂i |ψθ⟩and ∂i ≡∂/∂θi. A notable prop-
erty of the QGT is its invariance under gauge transforma-
tions: Q(|ψ′
θ⟩) = Q(|ψθ⟩) for |ψ′
θ⟩= eiαθ |ψθ⟩, where αθ
depends on θ arbitrarily. This invariance allows the QGT
to characterize quantum states in a projective Hilbert
space, where a global phase is irrelevant.
The real part of the QGT is known as the Fubini-Study
metric [3–6], while its imaginary part is an antisymmetric
second-rank tensor known as Berry curvature [7–9]. The
integral of the Berry curvature over an oriented manifold,
called the Berry phase [7, 10, 11], can be observed in var-
ious topological and quantized phenomena, such as the
Aharonov–Bohm eﬀect [12, 13] and the quantum anoma-
lous Hall eﬀect [14–16].
The QGT has proved central
for the characterization of quantum systems in terms of
ﬁdelity susceptibility [17–20], also the study of various
quantum materials [21, 22], and has been experimentally
measured in several systems [23–25]. In quantum infor-
mation, the QGT has been shown to be the asymptotic
conversion rate in the resource theory of asymmetry [26].
For a general mixed state, a possible generalization of
the QGT is based on the symmetric logarithmic deriva-
tive (SLD) operator [27].
The SLD, denoted as Li ≡
Li(̺θ), is a Hermitian operator deﬁned by the relation
∂i̺θ = (1/2)(Li̺θ + ̺θLi) with tr(̺θLi) = 0. The SLD-
based QGT is given by [6]:
[Q(̺θ)]ij = tr(̺θLiLj).
(2)
For pure states, this reduces to Eq. (1), since Li(|ψθ⟩) =
2(|∂iψθ⟩⟨ψθ| + |ψθ⟩⟨∂iψθ|).
The real part, Re[Q(̺θ)] ≡FQ(̺θ) is the quantum
Fisher information matrix (QFIM) [28]. It describes the
inﬁnitesimal change of Bures distance [29] between ̺θ
and ̺θ+δθ following an incremental change of θ in the
multiparameter space [30–32]. The inverse F−1
Q
sets the
ultimate sensitivity bound, called the quantum Cramér-
Rao bound [27], for the joint estimation of m unknown
parameters θ, serving as a benchmark in multiparam-
eter quantum metrology [33, 34]. For single-parameter
(m = 1) unitary encoding, the scalar quantum Fisher in-
formation has been related to entanglement properties of
̺θ [35–39], see also Refs. [40, 41] for investigations in the
m ≥2 scenario. The imaginary part, Im[Q(̺θ)] ≡G(̺θ),
is a SLD-based generalization of the Berry curvature,
known as mean Uhlmann curvature [6, 42].
Interest-
ingly, G has been associated with measurement incom-
patibility [43] as well as with saturation conditions of the
quantum Cramér-Rao bound in multiparameter quantum
estimation [44, 45].
Since Eqs. (1, 2) depend solely on the quantum state,
a natural question arises: Can the QGT have a non-
trivial counterpart that explicitly includes measurement
operators?
In quantum mechanics, a generalized mea-
surement is described by a set of positive operator-valued
measure (POVM) operators, {Eω}, where 0 ≤Eω ≤
1
and P
ω Eω =
1 for ω being a possible measurement
outcome with probability pω(θ) = tr(̺θEω) as given
by the Born rule [46].
It is known that the QFIM
has a natural measurement-dependent counterpart: the
classical Fisher information matrix (CFIM), FC(̺θ) ≡
FC(̺θ, {Eω}), with elements
[FC(̺θ)]i,j =
X
ω
[∂ipω(θ)][∂jpω(θ)]
pω(θ)
,
(3)
where the sum runs over all measurement outcomes.
An essential result is the inequality [32, 34, 47, 48]:
FC(̺θ) ≤FQ(̺θ),
(4)
which holds for all POVM operators and quantum states.
However, Eq. (4) is saturated under optimal measure-
ment conditions [47, 48] only if the imaginary part of
