modulated by: electrostatically doping WS2 that corresponds to the electron-transfer 
TR profile (Figure S4); increasing sample temperature that corresponds to the 
temperature-increase TR profile (Figure S5); electrostatically doping MoSe2 that 
corresponds to the screening TR profile (Figure S6). As shown in Figure S7, we can 
see that the temperature-increase and screening TR profiles are almost the same, which 
are different from the electron-transfer TR profile. We expect that temperature increase 
has a larger contribution to the TR signal than that of the screening, because 
photoexcited excitons in MoSe2 are dipole-like neutral quasiparticles that should have 
weak remote screening effect on the hBN-separated WS2. See the SI for more 
discussion about the three effects. 
We use the two TR profiles of electron transfer and temperature increase as the bases 
to fit the experimental TR spectrum, referred as the two-profile analysis, which can give 
𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 and lattice temperature increment ∆𝑇𝑇∗. Figure 2c and d show the TR spectra at 
𝜏𝜏=1.2 and 40 ps, respectively, in spite of distinct shapes, both of which can be well fit 
by the two-profile analysis. We extract 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 and ∆𝑇𝑇∗ as a function of 𝜏𝜏 shown in 
Figure 2e and f, respectively, except initial delays ( ≤0.4 ps) that suffer from 
contaminating effects of coherent light-matter interaction (see fittings at other time 
delays in Figure S8). The 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 and ∆𝑇𝑇∗ dynamics are further fit by a two-exponential 
function (dashed) that gives the rise and decay time constants. 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 shows a rise time 
constant of 2.6 ps and a decay time constant of 138 ps. The rise dynamics of 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 is
