and especially the ground state, of the AIM described
by the Kondo model beyond the perturbative regime? Is
the full phase diagram of the NH Kondo model shown in
Fig. 1(a) accessible within the AIM?
We answer these questions using non-perturbative NH-
NRG. The mapping between Hermitian AIM and Kondo
models beyond Schrieffer-Wolff was first established in
Ref. [55] using NRG, and we adopt the same strategy here
for the NH case. In Fig. 3 we confirm explicitly that the
same stable fixed points are reached in the same way un-
der RG in both models, for both SC and LM phases [56].
NH-NRG results also confirm that the phase diagram
of the NH AIM in the (ReV, ImV ) plane has the same
structure as that of the NH Kondo model, including the
re-entrant Kondo behavior at large ImV [46] and the ter-
mination of the LM phase beyond a critical value of ReV .
Conclusion and outlook.– The numerical renormaliza-
tion group is often considered the gold-standard method
of choice for solving quantum impurity models [41]. Here
we generalized the method to treat non-Hermitian im-
purity problems, and applied our NH-NRG approach to
the NH Kondo and NH Anderson models. NH-NRG is
non-perturbative and can be applied equally well to non-
integrable systems and those without the linear disper-
sion property, such as the pseudogap Kondo model. The
method provides direct access to the RG flow of the com-
plex many-particle eigenvalues: it allows different phases
to be fingerprinted by identification of characteristic fixed
point structures, and emergent energy scales can be read
off from the crossovers between fixed points.
NH-NRG opens the door to studying the interplay be-
tween NH and strong correlation physics in a wide range
of models – for example systems with multiple impuri-
ties [57–61] and/or multiple baths [62–65], impurities in
unconventional materials [66–73], underscreened Kondo
effect with higher spin [74, 75], and critical phenomena
near impurity quantum phase transitions [76, 77]. NH-
NRG could be extended to compute zero-temperature
dynamical quantities, such as the impurity spectral
function [78].
This would allow non-Hermitian lattice
models [79, 80] to be studied within DMFT [81], using
NH-NRG as an impurity solver. Our NH-NRG code is
provided open source at Ref. [51].
