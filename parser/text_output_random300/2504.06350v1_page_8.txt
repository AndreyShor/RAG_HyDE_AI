(b) DI–QKD
Figure 4: Comparative Analysis of DI-QKD and MDI-QKD Experiments – Fig. 4a encapsulates the progress in quantum
communication distances achieved through MDI-QKD implementations (see. 3). In contrast fully-DI-QKD in Fig. 4b at
distances: 2 m (yellow)[51], 20 m, 100 m, and 200 m (red)[52], and 400 m (blue)[53].
400 m — with those achieved using Measurement Device Independent-QKD (MDI-QKD), a related but
distinct approach that is easier to implement.
Despite the challenges that lie ahead in terms of practical implementation and scalability, as the tech-
nology readiness level currently stands at 2-4, with expectations to advance to level 3-5 in the coming
years, the pursuit of DI-QKD continues to push the boundaries of what is possible for secure communi-
cations negating the possibility of inventa fraus.
1.5. Focus of this Review
Here, we provide an in-depth presentation of DI-QKD, while also introducing Semi-device independent
methods, including standard SDI-QKD, as well as MDI-QKD (see Fig. 4a), receiver DI-QKD (RDI-QKD),
and one–sided DI-QKD (1SDI-QKD). As shown in Fig. 3, this review integrates DI-QKD theoretical
proofs [50, 30, 54–72], and experimental challenges [73–78] (with BI loopholes), resulting in fully DI-
QKD experiments [51–53] (see Fig. 4b). We present simulations that bridge the gap with experiments in
[79–81], as well as advanced mathematical methods, such as entropy accumulation and bounds in [82–
87, 25]. DI randomness generation (theory[88–90], experiments[91–93]), and broader DI-QKD versions
(theory [38, 94–97], experiments [98–103], are also discussed.
A number of very nice review papers have covered theoretical, experimental and implementation
aspects of QKD and DI-QKD [4–6, 16, 32, 104–108]. As the DI framework relies on Bell nonlocality, we
also refer the reader to reviews on this subject [109–111]. In the present review, we have attempted to
build on this previous work by including the most recent results, and providing alternative approaches
when possible. For example, the topic of Bell nonlocality in section 2 is presented using the modern
approach of causal structures. While touching upon mathematical and technological advancements, our
review, starting with a pedagogical focus, remains concise, without claiming to cover all developments
exhaustively, but providing references to relevant details in references, as well as a repository of simulations
and tutorials, which we have made available online [18].
2. Nonclassicality in quantum cryptography
Not all entangled states violate a BI (see Fig. 2b, [112]). Then, different types of non-classical behavior
lead to distinct communication tasks. In this section, we introduce the ones related to DI cryptography.
2.1. Bell nonlocality
In 1862 Boole laid out conditions for probabilities and logical constraints that any consistent probability
theory should follow [113] a.k.a. Boole’s conditions of “possible experience”, or causal instruments [114]
. Boole’s work was essentially about the constraints on observable correlations, an early classical
analogue to BI’s constraints on local and realistic correlations [115]. A Bell test, in its simplest form,
involves two random measurement settings X3 and Y assuming values x, y ∈{0, 1}, with dichotomous
outcomes A and B with values a, b ∈{0, 1} for Alice (A) and Bob (B), who are space-like separated, as
3We refer with the capital letter to the random variable and its lower case the values that it can assume.
