string. He can then use a to measure Bob’s send-
ing photons and see if their states match b; he then
re-prepares the same photons according to a, b and
forward them to Alice. He can also require Alice
to send him the message m she wants to send to
Bob anytime before she returns Bob’s photons, and
measures her returning photons to check if she is re-
ally sending m to Bob; he then re-prepares the same
B-batch and re-encodes the message into them and
forward them to Bob.
As we can see, everything in the standard DL04 pro-
tocol is basically transparent to this controller.

Covert Key Distribution in DL04
We use entangled photons and Bell states to achieve
covert key distribution under the control of this Colin.
The idea is to carry a random covert message m′ (the key
that Alice wants to share with Bob) by the Bell states of
entangled photons. More speciﬁcally, we let the A-batch
to be the signal photons of a set of entangled photons
of random Bell states. Alice encodes an extra bit into
each photon in the B-batch by ﬂipping the bit diﬀerent
times, which will result in a change of the Bell state of the
entangled pair, and only Bob, who has the idler photons
can measure the Bell states of the entangled pairs, and
thus tell any Bell state changes. Colin has no idea about
the Bell state of the entangled pairs since he does not
have the idler photons. He will have zero advantage in
telling any Bell state changes. The revised DL04 is as
follows.
1. Photons Sending Phase:
• Bob generates three random strings:
– a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈{0, 1}n, the basis se-
lection string.
– b = (b1, . . . , bn) ∈{0, 1}n, the state selec-
tion string.
– c = (c1, . . . , cn) ∈{0, 1}n, the Bell state
selection string.
• Bob
prepares
n
entangled
photon
pairs
(Ai, Bi) in the Bell state |Φci⟩AiBi (if ai = 0)
or |Ψci⟩AiBi (if ai = 1), where:
|Φci⟩AiBi =
1
√
2
(|0⟩Ai|0⟩Bi + (−1)ci|1⟩Ai|1⟩Bi)
|Ψci⟩AiBi =
1
√
2 (|0⟩Ai|1⟩Bi + (−1)ci|1⟩Ai|0⟩Bi)
• Bob
selects
signal
photons
A
=
(A1, A2, . . . , An) according to b and sends
them to Alice,
where the selection is as
follows:
– If bi = 0, the photon that will be mea-
sured as |0⟩(if ai = 0) or |+⟩(if ai = 1)
is marked as the signal photon Ai and the
other is marked as the idler photon Bi.
– If bi = 1, the photon that will be mea-
sured as |1⟩(if ai = 0) or |−⟩(if ai = 1)
is marked as the signal photon Ai and the
other is marked as the idler photon Bi.
• Alice and Bob performs an error rate estima-
tion process as in the standard DL04 using an
S-batch.
2. Photons Returning Phase:
• After conﬁrming the security of the B-batch,
Alice proceeds to encode the normal mes-
sage m = {0, 1}k and random covert message
m′ = {0, 1}k by ﬂipping the photons in B-
batch with the unitary operation:
• U = iσy = |0⟩⟨1| −|1⟩⟨0|
for 0, 1, 2, 3 times depending on whether mim′
i
is 00, 01, 10 or 11.
– Applying U on |0⟩and |+⟩for 0, 1, 2, 3
times results in single photon state/phase
changed as:
• |0⟩
U−→−|1⟩
U−→−|0⟩
U−→|1⟩
• |+⟩
U−→|−⟩
U−→−|+⟩
U−→−|−⟩
It results in Bell state changed as:
• |Φ+⟩
U−→|Φ−⟩
U−→−|Φ+⟩
U−→−|Φ−⟩
• |Ψ+⟩
U−→|Ψ−⟩
U−→−|Ψ+⟩
U−→−|Ψ−⟩
• Alice then sends the encoded B-batch, A′ =
(A′
1, A′
2, . . . , A′
k), back to Bob.
3. Decoding Phase:
• Bob can recover one of m and m′ but not both.
Bob can recover the normal message bit mi
by checking if the state of the signal photon
A′
i has ﬂipped.
Bob can recover the covert
message bit m′
i by checking if the Bell state of
the entangle pair (A′
i, Bi) has ﬂipped.
• If Bob chooses to recover m, he performs the
second error rate estimation with Alice nor-
mally as standard DL04. If Bob chooses to
decode m′, he performs the second error rate
estimation using a random string (and they
will announce failure with high probability).
The correctness of the protocol can be seen from the
explanation embedded in the protocol description.
Let us analyze what Colin can do to detect the exis-
tence of covert communication, and show why the proto-
col is secure (i.e., covert communication undetectable).
Colin can measure Bob’s photon on their way to Alice
and see if they are single photons (no entangled pho-
tons are expected in normal DL04). However, without
