2.3.1 Absolute difference: Between-group variance (BGV) 
The between-group variance49 (BGV) is an absolute difference measure that squares deviations 
from a population average and reports them as a sum, weighting by population group size. It reports 
the variance that would exist if each patient had the median health of their group.   
2.3.2 Relative difference: Index of Disparity (IDisp) 
The index of disparity45 (IDisp) is a relative difference measure that (1) sums the absolute 
differences in a health status between several group rates and a reference rate and (2) reports them 
as a proportion of the reference rate. It is a modified coefficient of variation measure. In this study, 
the reference group was set to be the ‘White’ group for the SDOH demographic correlate of race 
and the ‘Male’ group for the SDOH demographic correlate of sex. The authors of HD*Calc 
recommend using the group with the ‘best’ health outcome, but because this is undefined for the 
lung parenchyma score, we decided to use these reference groups because our population is drawn 
from the United States.   
2.3.3 Relative difference: Thiel Index 
The Thiel Index50 (T) is a relative difference measure that uses the ratio of the health status of each 
group to the average health status of the population, weighted by the population proportions, to 
measure general disproportionality. It has a range of 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect equality 
and 1 represents complete inequality. 
2.3.4 Relative difference: Mean Log Deviation (MLD) 
The Mean Log Deviation51 (MLD) is a relative difference measure that also measures general 
disproportionality by using a natural logarithm applied to ratio of the health status of each group
