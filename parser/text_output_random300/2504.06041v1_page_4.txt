Fig. 4. Total noise versus frequency for (a) S1, (b) S2, (c) S3 sensors. 
For the optimum excitation current amplitude of 1 mA, both the sensor 
noise and the noise fit are shown.  
meaning it is constant over frequency, and can be calculated using the 
following equation: 
𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙
2
= 4𝑘𝐵𝑇𝑅𝑥𝑦    (7) 
 
Here, 𝑘𝐵  is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649×10−23 J⋅K−1), T is the 
temperature and 𝑅𝑥𝑦 is the sensor resistance along the hard axis. Note 
that, 𝑅𝑥𝑦 has a linear dependency with the sensor thickness and width 
[Mor 2017]. 
Intermixing noise in the PHMR sensor can be written as, 
𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑥

= 𝑉𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑡

 ( 
𝛿𝐼𝑛
𝐼𝑥)        (8) 
where δIn is the Nyquist noise of the operating current from the 
current source. Due to a mismatch of the PHMR electrode arms, there  
is a voltage drop along the y-axis corresponding to the offset voltage 
(Voffset) of the PHMR sensor. In this case, both sensor voltage (𝑉𝑦) and 
𝑅𝑥𝑦 have a non-zero value due to a fabrication error. 
Here Ix and 𝑅𝑥𝑦 are the sensor operating current and off-diagonal 
PHMR tensor component [Lee 2021].  
In this study, the baseline of the preamplifier noise is down to 2.4 
nV/√Hz and environmental noise at room temperature includes all 
possible electromagnetic interferences from nearby electronics, 
vibration etc. Thus, field resolution or detectivity of the magnetic field 
sensor can be defined as,

D. Results and Discussions 
I. Sensor Characterization:  
The fabricated PHMR sensors are characterized to determine their 
magnetic and electronic properties. It includes the measurement 
performance of the sensor's sensitivity, linearity range, and hysteresis. 
Note that, in this study the applied field, By is the small compared to 
the total magnetic anisotropy, Ha + Hex in order to reduce the sensor 
offset and to increase the linearity [Piskin 2020]. The measured 
sensitivity for S1 is ~ 1.41 x 103 V/TA whereas for S2 and S3, the 
sensitivities are 1.61 x 103 V/TA and 1.57 x 103 V/TA, respectively. 
Sensor linearity quantifies the deviation from a linear relationship 
between the sensor's output and the applied magnetic field. The 
linearity range for these sensors lies within an operational range of 20 
mT. Only a negligible hysteresis is observed. 
In order to increase the sensitivity, an annealing measurement is 
conducted for S2 using a box furnace (Goldbrunn 450 Vacuum Dryer). 
The annealing temperature was set to 250 ºC for 1 hour at ≤20 mbar 
air pressure. After annealing, a 27% enhancement in sensitivity is 
observed for the S2 sample. The 𝑆𝑦 is increased to 2.76 x 103 V/TA 
from 1.61 x 103 V/TA. Further enhancements in sensitivity might be 
possible by manipulating the sensor material and annealing 
parameters. Note that, this sensitivity enhancement has no effect on 
the sensor noise level which will be discussed in detail in next section. 
Furthermore, few more actions (such as changing the gas, and 
increasing the annealing temperature and time) can be taken into 
consideration for further enhancement in sensitivity. 
II. Noise spectral density (NSD):  
Figure 5 represents the NSD of all studied PHMR samples at 1 mA 
excitation current up to 25 Hz bandwidth. The NSD is fitted 
employing the equation [Nhalil 2019], 
𝑁𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒= √𝑎0
2 + (
𝑎1
𝑓𝛾)
2
    [
𝑉
√𝐻𝑧]    (10) 
where, 𝑎0, 𝑎1 and γ are the fit parameters. Here, 𝑁𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 stands for 
total noise of the sensor as stated in eq. (5). Usually, the exponent 𝛾 
remains ≤1. The fit parameters and the extracted detectivity 
(resolution) at 0.1 Hz, and 10 Hz are summarized in Table - I. It is 
found that the detectivity (resolution) of S2 at 0.1 Hz (7.1 nT/√Hz) is 
better than that of the other two sensors. A further detailed 
investigation is required to explain this intriguing 1⁄f nature of S2 in  
the context of exchange pinning strength at the interface. Note that for 
S1 the 1⁄f noise might be considerably higher because of stronger 
exchange coupling. For all sensors the corner frequency is found to 
be considerably lower compared to S1, especially for S2 it is found to 
be below 0.5 Hz. However, the best resolution of ~ 1.8 nT/√Hz is 
achieved at 10 Hz for the S3, while at 0.1 Hz the detectivity (D) is 
found around 39.7 nT/√Hz The thermal noise for the S2 is calculated 
around 3.8 nV/√Hz (see eq. 7) and the reported preamplifier noise is 
2.4 nV/√Hz. Thus, the noise contribution from these components is 
4.5 nV/√Hz. However, the total white noise for S2 is measured as ~ 
5.6 nV/√Hz. The excess noise, 3.3 nV/√Hz originates in the offset 
contribution and environmental components. Similarly, for S1 and S3  
the excess noise can be attributed to intermixing and non-shielded 
environmental components. From these results, it can be seen that S2 
is more promising compared to the other sensors. Thus, the next step 
we investigated the effect of annealing on the NSD for S2 and no 
considerable change is observed. Finally, the best effective resolution 
is achieved around 1.3 nT/√Hz at 10 Hz. 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, Fig. 5 demonstrates that annealing effect has no pivotal 
role to suppress the NSD level of S2. 
 
IV CONCLUSION 
In summary, we have investigated the magnetic field 
resolution of three m-biPHMR sensors with 5 rings. By exciting the 
sensor with an optimized alternating current and optimizing the sensor 
thickness, we achieved a 1.8 nT/√Hz resolution at 10 Hz for S3. 
Interestingly, the 1/f noise component for S2 is much less than for the 
other two sensors. In addition, a 27% sensitivity improvement is 
observed by annealing S2 at 250 ºC. Thus, after annealing the best
