demonstrates the best performance, achieving the lowest RRMSE of 3.1%, compared
to 7.2% for SVD. The LSTM 1 Dense and LSTM Time-Distributed architectures also
show significant improvement with HOSVD, achieving RRMSE values of 4.7% and 3.9%,
respectively, compared to 8.6% and 5.4% for SVD.
For the normal velocity component (Table 15), the trend remains consistent, though
the overall errors are higher compared to the streamwise case. HOSVD achieves lower
RRMSE values across all architectures, with the LSTM Time-Distributed architecture
achieving the best performance at 29.3% compared to SVDâ€™s 34.5%. The LSTM 2 Dense
and LSTM 1 Dense architectures also maintain a significant advantage, with RRMSE
values of 29.4% and 33.6%, respectively, compared to 37.2% and 42.7% for SVD.
The streamwise and normal velocity components, depicted in Figure 26 and 27, re-
veal that HOSVD and SVD maintain considerable agreement with the ground truth.
Both LSTM 2 dense and LSTM time-distributed architectures demonstrate exceptional
performance, closely replicating the periodic nature of the streamwise oscillations while
minimizing deviations across the time steps. These results highlight the robustness of
decomposition techniques in capturing complex temporal dynamics. In comparison, the
LSTM 1 dense architecture, while still effective, displays minor discrepancies, particularly
at the peaks of the oscillations and over increasing time steps. The HOSVD-based LSTM
2 Dense and LSTM Time-Distributed architectures exhibit a superior ability to capture
finer-scale variations at the smaller crests and troughs compared to the SVD-based mod-
els, specifically at the streamwise temporal evolution plots.
