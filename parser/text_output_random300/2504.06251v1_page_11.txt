Fig. 3 | Observation of strong flat band and moir´e replica bands in aligned R5G/BN (sample
S1). a-d, Dispersion images measured along momentum lines parallel to Γ-K direction, as indi-
cated by black and red lines in (e). Red and blue arrows indicate the flat band and weak moir´e
band. f, Zoom-in dispersion image through the K point (data shown in b) using a log color scale.
g, Schematic dispersion of flat band (red curve) and moir´e bands (blue curves). h, EDCs extracted
at momenta from k1 to k15 as indicated in (f). Red and blue dots indicate peaks from the flat band
and moir´e replica bands. i, MDCs extracted at energy from e1 to e9 as indicated in (f). g, Schematic
summary of the experimental electronic structure of aligned R5G/BN.
