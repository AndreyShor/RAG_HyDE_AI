Cross-correlation analysis between γ-ray and optical flux variations.
The left panel shows ICCF (solid black
curve) with a significance level (dash red curve) of 4σ. The cross-correlation centroid distribution (CCCD) in orange and cross-
correlation peak distribution (CCPD) in blue are given in the right panel, where vertical dashes in orange and blue represent
the median of CCCD and CCPD, respectively.
rg = GM∗/c2. The corresponding size of the emitting
region is Dms = 12rg.
In the case of Kerr black hole (j=1, maximally rotat-
ing), for prograde orbits, the emitting region is De =
2re = 4rg, where re represents the equatorial boundary
of the ergosphere. These estimated sizes are consistent
with findings from general relativistic magnetohydrody-
namic (GRMHD) simulations (D. L. Meier et al. 2001).
Thus, the size of the blob spans from D0 = 4 −12rg for
0 ⩽j ≲1. Following equation 13, we have (as given in
equations 6a and 6b in H. Liu & J. Bai (2015) )

A. Acharyya et al. (2023) reported the fasted observed
variability timescale in γ-rays of 6.2±0.9 hr around
MJD 57178. We utilized this timescale to constrain the
black hole mass. The calculated black hole masses are
M Sch
var ≲2.74 × 109 M⊙and M Kerr
var
≲8.22 × 109 M⊙.
In the calculation, we adopted the Doppler factor value,
δ=9.6 (R. Zhou et al. 2021; A. Acharyya et al. 2023).
The uncertainties in the estimated black hole masses
were determined based on the errors in the variability
timescale. However, the lack of precise information re-
garding the exact location of the emission region relative
to the central black hole could introduce additional un-
certainties, potentially increasing the error bars on the
mass estimates.
By combining the estimates of the lower and upper
limits of the black hole mass, we obtain a mass range
of (0.142 < M∗< 8.22) × 109 M⊙. Notably, the lower
limit derived from the variability study is higher than
the estimate reported by Z. Pei et al. (2022).
In recent years, several studies have demonstrated a
correlation between variability timescales and black hole
mass. C. J. Burke et al. (2021) identified a relationship
between optical timescales in accretion disks and black
hole masses, spanning the entire mass range of super-
massive black holes and even extending to stellar-mass
BH systems. This correlation has been further explored
across different electromagnetic bands, including γ-rays
(J. L. Ryan et al. 2019; H. Zhang et al. 2022, 2023; A.
Sharma et al. 2024b; H. Zhang et al. 2024; A. Sharma
et al. 2024c), X-rays (H. Zhang et al. 2024), and sub-
millimeter wavelengths (B.-Y. Chen et al. 2023). No-
tably, the observed γ-ray variability timescales in AGNs
have been found to overlap with those in the optical
band (C. J. Burke et al. 2021), suggesting a link be-
tween non-thermal jet emissions and thermal emissions
from accretion disks. Thus, by utilizing the relationship
between the rest-frame variability timescale

In our study, we estimated the mass of the SMBH
to be approximately (7.3 ± 6) × 109M⊙based on a rest-
frame damping timescale of ∼547 days observed in γ-ray
emission of the blazar ON 246. While the uncertainty
in the SMBH mass estimation is considerably high, the
derived mass value is less and close to the upper limit of
