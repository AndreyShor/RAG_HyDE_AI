to a molecular orbital ψ, where G is the symmetry group of the system, Γ an irreducible
representation of G with dimensionality dΓ, and χΓ(ˆg) the character of the symmetry
operation ˆg in Γ, we can determine the Γ-composition of ψ:
cΓ(ψ) = ⟨ψ| ˆPΓ|ψ⟩= dΓ

if ψ is normalised. This procedure can be carried out using QSYM2[24]. Since the
calculations for Ar@C60 were done with a perfect icosahedral structure, the group G
is the icosahedral group Ih and the possible irreducible representations are Ag, T1g,
T2g, Fg, Hg, Au, T1u, T2u, Fu, and Hu. The above procedure applied to the ground-
and excited-state 4s molecular orbitals yields the decomposition shown in 1.
We know from the O(3) ⊃Ih subduction that the first few even spherical harmonics
have the following symmetries in Ih:
S (l = 0) →Ag,
D (l = 2) →Hg,
G (l = 4) →Fg ⊕Hg,
I (l = 6) →Ag ⊕T1g ⊕Fg ⊕Hg.
Hence, with the decompositions shown above, we deduce that the ground-state 4s
molecular orbital consists approximately of ∼% S-component, whereas the excited-
state distorted 4s molecular orbital consists approximately of ∼76% S-symmetry
component, ∼23% D-symmetry component, and less than 1% G-symmetry com-
ponent. A direct decomposition of each molecular orbital into spherical-harmonic
components is possible but is beyond the scope of this work.

for the ground- and excited-state 4s molecular
orbitals in the Ih structure. Both of these molecular
orbitals are even with respect to spatial inversion,
and so only the gerade irreducible representations
need to be considered.
