11.3. Some identities. Yukawa-ϕ4 theory has a rich structure of identities. Beyond the star-triangle
identity in Figure 6 we have the identities in Figure 8. These identities act solely on the spin. The
weights of the propagators are unchanged. Choosing suitable coordinates, they are graphical versions of
the elementary equations
(108)
x/(−x/) = −x2,
x/(y/ −x/)(−y/) = −y/(x/ −y/)(−x/).
The last equation is true because both sides equal x2y/ −y2x/. Note that the latter identity renders a
Feynman period zero if the graph is symmetric upon interchanging the two fat vertices on the right hand
side of Figure 8.
Together with the star-triangle identity, these two identities give rise to the identities in Figure 9. On
the left-hand side, a triangle loop may be reduced to a triangle without fermion loop. The edges may
have any weights. The identity on the right-hand side is a reduction inside Yukawa-ϕ4 theory. Both sides
of the equation can be considered as subgraphs of (completed) Yukawa-ϕ4 graphs.
The Feynman period of a completed primitive graph factorizes if it has a three vertex split (label
the split vertices 0, 1, ∞and the Feynman integral factorizes). The only (convergent) configuration in
Yukawa-ϕ4 theory is depicted in Figure 10 where all fermion edges have weight 3/2 and all boson edges
have weight 1,

More factorizations are possible in the generalized set of Feynman graphs which include fermion edges of
weight 1/2.
11.4. Small graphs. In Figure 11 we list all completed graphs with ≤5 loops in Yukawa-ϕ4 theory
which have a finite Feynman period. Note that some of the graphs have period 1 by successive use of the
star-triangle identity, see Figure 6.
The only graph with non-rational period contributes to the three-loop beta function of the Yukawa
interaction.
