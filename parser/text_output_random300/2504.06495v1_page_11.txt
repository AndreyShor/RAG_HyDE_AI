ψ ﬁrst branches into states b1, . . . , bn upon experimental measurement at time τ1, followed
by each state bi branching naturally into ni states ai,1, . . . , ai,ni until time τ2.

Thus, while at time τ1 the measurement outcome states b ∈B diﬀer only in their squared
norms φb, these diﬀerences naturally translate into proportional diﬀerences in the number of
5In our formalizations of equation (4) in Theorem 1 and 2 below, we introduce a small parameter ǫ that
controls the signal truncation. The complete formulation then also involves taking the limit ǫ →0, but we
omit this technical detail here to focus on the core concepts. Also, the limit ǫ →0 will actually not be
necessary anymore in Theorem 3.
