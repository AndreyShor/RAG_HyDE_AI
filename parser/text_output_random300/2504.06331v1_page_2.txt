2020; Covino et al. 2020) or by looking for peculiar spectral fea-
tures (Tsalmantza et al. 2011; Eracleous et al. 2012; Ju et al.
2013; Shen et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2017).
If the two black holes are at a separation such that at least one
of them still retains its own broad-line region (BLR), then we ex-
pect broad emission lines (BELs) to be shifted in frequency with
respect to their respective narrow emission lines (NELs) and to
evolve in time over a binary orbital period. Unfortunately, asym-
metric emission line profiles could also be explained by eccentric
BLRs (Eracleous et al. 1997), as well as circular BLRs featuring
deviations from an axisymmetric emissivity profile; for example,
as hot spots (Jovanovi´c et al. 2010) or spiral patterns (Storchi-
Bergmann et al. 2017). In addition, even symmetric BLRs might
appear as asymmetric in observations in the presence of par-
tial obscuration from dust (Gaskell & Harrington 2018), or if
the BLR is attached to a recoiling SMBH (Volonteri & Madau
2008). In these cases, the obvious way of checking for the pres-
ence of a SMBHB would be to measure the expected drift in
wavelengths by observing the candidate over a binary orbital pe-
riod1.
At smaller separations where the BLR is either truncated
(Montuori et al. 2011) or shared by both SMBHs, photometric
variability is still expected over orbital timescales due to pe-
riodic fueling from the circumbinary material (e.g., Hayasaki
et al. 2008; Tiede et al. 2024), Doppler boosted (DB) emission
(D’Orazio et al. 2015), or periodic gravitational lensing from the
companion of the active component of the SMBHB (D’Orazio
& Di Stefano 2018; Davelaar & Haiman 2022b,a). Even in these
cases, alternative interpretations have been proposed for quasi-
periodically modulated sources, either assuming Lense-Thirring
driven precessing jets (Sandrinelli et al. 2016; Britzen et al.
2018) or only apparent (quasi-)periodicities due to the effect of
correlated noise together with the intrinsic difficulties affecting
the analysis of short (compared to the searched-for periodicities)
time series (Vaughan et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2018; Covino et al.
2019).
One of the strongest candidate SMBHBs identified through
periodicity in its light curve is PG 1302-102; a quasar with a me-
dian V-band magnitude of 15.0 and a redshift of 0.2784 showing
variability in multiple bands (Liu et al. 2024) as well as the pres-
ence of BELs (Graham et al. 2015b). This object has been ob-
served across multiple wavelengths, including optical (Graham
et al. 2015b), ultraviolet (D’Orazio et al. 2015; Xin et al. 2020),
infrared (Jun et al. 2015), and X-rays (Saade et al. 2024)2. The
modulation of PG 1302-102 has been explained through the DB
emission of an unequal-mass binary: when the secondary black
hole accretes matter onto a mini-disk, the emission is DB due
to the relativistic3 orbital motion of the secondary. PG 1302-102
also exemplifies the well-known challenge of determining the in-
trinsic nature of a quasar based on the observation of a limited
number of periodic cycles (Covino et al. 2019); indeed, its true
nature remains a topic of debate. For instance, Vaughan et al.
(2016) argue that the light curve observed in PG 1302-102 is
better described with a damped random walk model (Kelly et al.
2009) rather than a sinusoid with uncorrelated noise (see also
Graham et al. 2015b). This hypothesis is supported by the fact
that PG 1302-102 was selected as the most periodic source from
1 Given the typical binary separations involved in order to be conclu-
sive, such test could require up to ∼> 10−100 yr (Tsalmantza et al. 2011;
Eracleous et al. 2012).

a sample of ∼250 000 light curves. With such ratios (i.e., 1
in 250 000), it is likely that one will find some quasar that ap-
pears periodic purely by coincidence. Similarly, Liu et al. (2018)
measured a decreased evidence for periodicity when additional
data were included in the modeling. Conversely, Zhu & Thrane
(2020) show that if correlated noise is combined with sinusoidal
variation then quasi-periodic oscillation is the most favored ex-
planation for PG 1302-102 variability.
In this paper, we aim to further clarify the nature of PG
1302-102. We apply a fully Bayesian approach to the highest-
resolution spectrum of this source, observed using the Echelle
SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic
Observations (ESPRESSO, Pepe et al. 2021) on the Very Large
Telescope (VLT). Specifically, we present an improved char-
acterization of the broad and narrow line region properties of
PG 1302-102, by examing the emission lines for substructures,
such as nonsymmetric, redshifted, and blueshifted components.
This paper is organized as follows: in § 2 we describe the
collected data and the reduction process; in § 3 we detail our
procedure for determining the best description of the spectrum
also providing a physically motivated interpretation for the BLR
of PG 1302-102; in § 4 we discuss the implication of our findings
in relation with the putative binary nature of PG 1302-102; and,
finally, in § 5 we provide a short summary of our work.
2. Data
PG 1302-102 was observed with VLT ESPRESSO in early 2018,
during the instrument’s third commissioning run. Three expo-
sures of 1200 s each were taken on February 27, February 28,
and March 3. The instrument was operated in SINGLEHR mode,
meaning that it was accepting light from VLT Unit Telescope
(UT) at a time (respectively, UT2, UT1, and UT3 for the three
exposures), using the 140 µm fibre for high resolution. The de-
tector was binned by 2 in the spatial direction and by 1 in the
spectral direction, achieving a resolving power of approximately
138, 000.
The data were reduced with the official pipeline released by
ESO4, version 1.3.2. Standard calibrations were used to remove
the instrumental signature and calibrate the spectra into phys-
ical units. Wavelength calibration was performed using the in-
strument built-in Fabry-Pérot interferometer, with a ThAr lamp
acting as an absolute reference. Flux calibration was performed
with the aid of two spectro-photometric standard stars (HR 4963
for February 27 and March 3, HR 5501 for March 3). The final
products of the pipelines were three reduced (flat-fielded, sky-
subtracted, wavelength- and flux-calibrated) spectra, provided
both in order-by-order and merged format.
To perform the analysis, we coadded the three reduced spec-
tra using the ESPRESSO Data Analysis Software (DAS)5, ver-
sion 1.04. We chose the order-by-order format to preserve the
original detector binning throughout the coaddition procedure
(merged spectra are already rebinned on a fixed wavelength
grid). The coaddition was performed with the approach de-
scribed in Cupani et al. (2016), equalizing the flux from the dif-
ferent exposures and appropriately weighting the contributions
to each bin of the final spectrum. In what follows, unless other-
wise specified, all quantities should be considered to be in the
rest frame system.
