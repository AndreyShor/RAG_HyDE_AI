E7 gauge group
Finally, we discuss E7, for which we have only two nontrivial representations with dimension
below 248. Just like above, the only solution we found is the one coming from the branching
E7 × SU(2) ⊂E8, in table 4.

Classical Lie algebras
In the previous Subsections we focused on exceptional algebras, where trace identities lead to
various simplifications. We now shift our attention to the more involved case of classical Lie
algebras. Although we will not be able to solve the problem explicitly in full generality (since
especially small algebras like SU(2) or Sp(2) have many representations of dimension below
248, and many invariants to be computed), we will be able to place significant constraints in
this case as well. We will start our search with the algebra An−1 i.e. SU(n) group, then we
proceed to analyze algebras Bn, Cn, Dn for n > 2.)

SU(n) algebra
Here, we explicitly study the algebra An−1 for n ≥6 and obtain solutions for the constraints
(3.12) and (3.13). For algebras with n ≤5 the number of representations significantly in-
creases as we go on lower n-values. Unfortunately, we have not been able to develop or find
