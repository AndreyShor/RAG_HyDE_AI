Lemma 4.13. For all k âˆˆN, Îµ > 0, and Î» > 0, there exists Î´ âˆˆ(0, Î») such that for all b â‰¥k
sufficiently large and Î· âˆˆ{0, Î´}, it holds that
P0,u,b(M0,k(Î¥b,g) â‰¥Î» âˆ’Î´ + Î·, M0,b(Î¥b,g) â‰¤Î» + Î·) â‰¤Îµu

Similarly, for all k âˆˆN, Îµ > 0, and Î» > 0 there exists Î´ âˆˆ(0, Î») such that for all b â‰¥k sufficiently
large and Î· âˆˆ{0, Î´}, it holds that
P(M0,k(Î¥âˆž) â‰¥Î» âˆ’Î´ + Î·, M0,b(Î¥âˆž) â‰¤Î» + Î·) â‰¤Îµ 1

Proof. The strategy for the proof of this lemma is quite similar to the strategy developed for the proof
of Lemma 4.10. We will provide the proof only for the case Î· = 0, as the case Î· = Î´ is completely
analogous. We fix k âˆˆN, Îµ > 0, and Î» > 0. For Î´ âˆˆ(0, Î»/2), we begin by observing that, thanks to
Lemmas 4.9, 4.10, and A.11, it holds that
P0,u,b(M0,b,k(Î¥b,g) â‰¥Î» âˆ’Î´ , M0,b(Î¥b,g) â‰¤Î») â‰²kâˆ’1

b ,
and so, if k > b/2 the claim follows by taking b > 0 large enough. Hence, from now on, we can focus
on the regime k < b/2. Thanks to Lemma 4.10, by choosing l > l0 for some l0 = l0(Îµ) > k, we can
assume that we are on the event {Kb â‰¤l} with Kb from Definition 4.6. Now, for Î´ âˆˆ(0, Î»/2), we
observe that thanks to (4.13),
{M0,k(Î¥b,g) â‰¥Î» âˆ’Î´, M0,b(Î¥b,g) â‰¤Î», Kb â‰¤l}

Thanks to (4.9), on the event {Kb â‰¤l}, by possibly taking l > l1 for some l1 = l1(Îµ, Î´) > l0, we can
assume that the event on the right-hand side in (4.27) is contained in
{M0,k(Î¥l,g) âˆˆ[Î» âˆ’2Î´, Î» + 2Î´]} âˆ©

These two events are conditionally independent given Ïƒ(Bl). In particular, on the event {Bl = z} for
some z â‰¥âˆ’Î» âˆ’Rl(l), the first conditional probability is equal to
P0,z,l(M0,k(Î¥l,g) âˆˆ[Î» âˆ’2Î´, Î» + 2Î´]) .
Now, thanks e.g. to [PT79, Theorem 3.1], we observe that by choosing Î´ = Î´(Îµ, k) < Î»/4 sufficiently
small, it holds that
sup
zâ‰¥âˆ’1âˆ’Rl(l)
P0,z,l(M0,k(Î¥l,g) âˆˆ[Î» âˆ’2Î´, Î» + 2Î´]) â‰¤Îµ .
(4.28)
To be precise, we cannot directly apply [PT79, Theorem 3.1] since Î¥l,g(0) = 0. However, this issue
can be easily overcome by noting that, by taking Î· = Î·(Îµ) > 0 sufficiently small, it holds that
sup
zâ‰¥âˆ’1âˆ’Rl(l)
P0,z,l

To obtain (4.28), we note that the variance of the field Î¥l,g over the annulus Bk \ B(0, Î·) can be
uniformly lower bounded by a quantity depending on Î·. Therefore, by [PT79, Theorem 3.1], the
density with respect to the Lebesgue measure of the supremum of the field Î¥l,g over the annulus
