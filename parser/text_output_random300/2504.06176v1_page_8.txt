Figure 6: Example normal (A-D) and anomalous (E-H) light curves generated by CASSANDRA as a fine-tuning dataset. Normal
curves are typically smooth bell-shaped profiles (A-B), monotonic increasing curves (C), or non-periodic variation with mod-
erate changes in amplitude (D). Anomalous curves contain a variety of distinct characteristic features, such as high-frequency
periodicity (E), isolated spikes on otherwise monotonic signals (F), irregular periodic profiles (G), and abrupt extended minima
followed by a transition to a periodic profile (H).
Table 3: Performance evaluation of the motion classification model on a held-out test dataset. The model achieves 82.74% overall
accuracy with an average ROC AUC of 0.9512. The metrics demonstrate varied performance across different motion classes, with
TUMBLING and SPIN showing the strongest classification performance, while INERTIAL exhibits high precision but low recall.
For YAW, the most common class, the model shows high recall but lower precision.

ally infinite number of decodable latent vectors, and therefore
also of synthetic data generation.
There are two key considerations when selecting the latent
vectors to generate synthetic data.
First, physical possibil-
ity/plausibility, which ensures generated curves represent possi-
ble SO behaviours rather than artifacts of the autoencoding pro-
cess. Second, the utility of the synthetic data, whereby we want
to generate synthetic data that is useful to the field of SDA. To
address these concerns, we outline a methodical approach be-
low which emphasises constraining the generation process over
sampling in a more general or random way. In other words, po-
tentially the most simple method would be to sample randomly
from the learned embedding space, and decode those into light
curves. However, whilst this can produce light curves that look
roughly realistic, there is no way to validate whether these light
curves are physically possible, or to intepret what they repre-
sent.
This is a particularly salient concern, as our Perceiver-VAE
is pre-trained on many different Space Objects (SOs), includ-
ing multiple types (e.g., satellites, rocket bodies, debris). It is
conceivable that we could index a set of latent vectors which
are halfway between encoding a Sentinel-3A light curve and a
piece of debris, which is an impossible curve.
Instead, we developed a reference-based sampling approach
that ties the synthetic data generation to known physical be-
haviours whilst allowing for controlled variation. To do this,
we queried our embedding space using reference curves as in-
puts (Figure 10). First, we provided an arbitrary index (Figure
10A), sampling the latent vectors which most strongly activated
in response to that input curve, adding varying amounts of noise
to those activation vectors, and decoding the resulting vectors
into light curves.
