Fig. S10. Full dataset for the second cycle SNOM scan of device 1. a-x SNOM 
images at different Vg following the sequence of applied Vg in our experiment. The 
range of the Vg applied is between -60 V and 80 V, larger than the first cycle 
measurement shown in Fig. S2. l and m in Fig. S2 are presented in the Fig. 3d and 3e 
of the main text. Weak fringe features in the vertical direction of SNOM images are 
presumably caused by the interference effect arising from scattered light from nearby
