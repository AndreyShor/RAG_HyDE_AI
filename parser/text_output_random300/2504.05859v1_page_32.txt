6. Identifying the TR profiles of the 𝐀𝐀𝐖𝐖 resonance induced by various effects 
6.1 The electron-transfer TR profile 
The electron transfer from MoSe2 to WS2 plays a role similar to electron doping WS2, 
and hence we can obtain the electron-transfer TR profile by measuring steady RC 
spectra with varying electron doping in WS2. Specifically, with a large 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸= 7 V, we 
can electron dope WS2 and keep MoSe2 neutral, as shown in Figure S4a,b, in which the 
reflectance of WS2, instead of MoSe2, is largely modulated by varying 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷. The 
electron-transfer TR profile is given by ൫RC𝑉𝑉−RC𝑉𝑉0൯൫RC𝑉𝑉0 + 1൯
ൗ
, as shown in Figure 
S4c. RC𝑉𝑉 is the RC spectrum of electron doped WS2 with 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷= 𝑉𝑉, and RC𝑉𝑉0 is the 
RC spectrum of neutral WS2 with 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷=𝑉𝑉0 =1.089 V. The normalized TR profiles 
obtained with various dopings have similar shapes (inset of Figure S4c). 
We correlate the magnitude of the electron-transfer TR profile with 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 in WS2, by 
extracting the maximum of the TR profiles as a function of 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷, shown in Figure S4d. 
For 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷 above 1.18 V, the maximum shows linear behavior, indicating good ohmic 
contact between the graphite electrode and TMD monolayers; however, for 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷 below 
1.18 V where 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 is small, the maximum shows superlinear behavior, which likely 
arises from non-ohmic contact between graphite electrode and TMD that is commonly 
seen for slightly doped TMD[5]. We obtained the change rate of the TR-profile 
maximum per 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 from the linear regime (𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷> 1.18 V) by using a parallel-plate 
capacitor model (see the section of calculation of 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 and 𝛥𝛥𝐶𝐶), which is applied to the 
whole doping regime.
