Brown et al. [86] showed that for each αk and any pair of ρ and σ, D(αk)(ρ||σ) ≥˜D(αk)(ρ||σ) Where
˜D(α) denotes the sandwiched Renyi divergence [287] which result in H↑
αk(A|B) ≤˜H↑
αk(A|B) ≤H(A|B)
for all α > 1 that can be used to compute lower bounds on the rates of various device-independent
protocols.
Both above methods improve upon the min-entropy method but neither has been shown to give tight
bounds on the actual rate of a protocol and in general, there appears to be significant room for improve-
ment. As such, the question remains as to whether one can give a computationally tractable method to
compute tight lower bounds on the rates of protocols. To address this question, Brown et al. [288] derived
a converging sequence of upper bounds on the relative entropy between two positive linear functionals on
a von Neumann algebra and demonstrated how to use this sequence of upper bounds to derive a sequence
of lower bounds on the conditional von Neumann entropy. The main technical result of their work is the
following theorem
Theorem 14. Assume that ρ and σ are two positive operators on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space
and λ > 0 is such that ρ ≤λσ. Then for any m ∈N there exists a choice of t1, · · · tm ∈(0, 1] and
ω1, · · · , ωm > 0 such that

to D(ρ||σ).
The theorem 14 provides a convergent sequence of upper bounds on the relative entropy in the form
of an optimization problem and can turn into SDP lower bounds on the rate of DI protocols. For the
case of DI-QKD and for the devices are constrained by quantum theory the following noncommutative

Bob measurements respectively which are bounded operators together with Za,i.
By applying the NPA hierarchy [127], this optimization can be relaxed into a sequence of SDPs that
yield a converging series of lower bounds on the optimal value. This, in turn, provides a lower bound
on the protocol’s rate. When calculating key rates for DI-QKD, a significant improvement (below 0.8)
in the minimum detection efficiency required to generate a secret key can be achieved, bringing it well
within the capabilities of current device-independent experiments. Araujo et al. [289] adapt the same
SDP hierarchy to the case of QKD with characterized devices.
4.5. Upper bounds
Up to this point, only the lower bounds on key rates have been explored for all the protocols mentioned.
In this section, we address a different question:
