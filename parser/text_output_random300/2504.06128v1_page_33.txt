SINGULARITY AND REGULARITY OF THE CRITICAL 2D SHF

where in the inequality, we enlarged the range of summation for b1. We can then use the
next bound, which can be proved by following the same steps as in [CSZ23a, Lemma 3.5]:
ÿ
xPZ2
UβN pn, xqeλ|x| ď cecλ2nUβN pnq.
From this bound, the negligibility of (4.46) as N Ñ 8 follows easily by a Markov type
inequality with appropriate choices λ.

Remark 4.6 (Sub-critical regime). In the sub-critical regime (1.26), we need to modify
(4.38) to:
lim
NÑ8 Erp∆N,iq2 | FNi´1s “ 1
M
ϱ ˆβ2
1 ` p1 ´
i
M q ϱ ˆβ2 .
(4.47)
The proof is the same, except that in (4.41) we need to apply (2.22) in place of (2.21), see
Remark 2.6.
Step 5. (Higher moment bounds). In this step, we control higher moments of
∆N,i defined in (4.9), proving the following bound (recall the second moment computation
(4.38)).
Proposition 4.7 (High moment bounds). For any h P N, there is a constant Ch ă 8
such that, for any M P N and i “ 1, . . . , M, we have the a.s. bound (uniformly over FNi´1):
lim sup
NÑ8
ˇˇ Erp∆N,iqh | FNi´1s
ˇˇ ď Ch
ˆ 1
M
ϱ

.
(4.48)
Note that the case h “ 1 is trivial by (4.37), while the case h “ 2 holds by (4.38), and
hence we focus on h ě 3, in which case the bound is a direct consequence of Theorem 1.11.
Proof. As in the proof Theorem 4.5, see (4.39), conditioned on FNi´1, ∆N,i can be written
as a modified partition function where the random walk is restricted to D ˜
Ni XDNi. In (4.39),
we can ignore the mean mN,i “ 1 ´ op1q (see (4.30)). Thanks to Theorem 1.11 (whose
assumptions we check in a moment), we can obtain a moment upper bound by removing
the random walk restriction and applying (1.33) to get
ˇˇ Erp∆N,iqh | FNi´1s
ˇˇ ď Ch Var

Our goal (4.48) then follows from (4.38), since, as we showed in the proof of Theorem 4.5,
lim

(4.49)
It only remains to check the assumptions of Theorem 1.11, namely that βN from (1.22)
and LN “ ˜Ni ´ Ni´1, φN “ µN,i´1 from (4.40) fullfill conditions (1.29), (1.30) and (1.32).
‚ The bounded variance condition (1.32) clearly holds by (4.49).
‚ By (4.32), we have φN “ µN,i´1 ď p1 ` εNq2 qNi´1´ ˜
Ni´1 ď 2 qNi´1´ ˜
Ni´1, so φN is
exponentially concentrated on the scale
b
Ni´1 ´ ˜Ni´1 „
a
Ni´1 much smaller than
b
˜Ni „ ?LN, thus condition (1.29) holds by the local limit theorem (2.3).
