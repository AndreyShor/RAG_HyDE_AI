potential.
Figure 3g-i further shows a quantitative analysis of the flat band and moir´e bands. The flat
band is clearly identified in the energy distribution curves (EDCs) shown in Fig. 3h (red shaded
peaks), while the moir´e bands are better resolved in the momentum distribution curves (MDCs)
shown in Fig. 3i (blue shaded peaks). Combining EDC and MDC analysis, the extracted disper-
sions for the flat band and moir´e bands are overplotted in Fig. 3f, where the momentum displace-
ment of the moir´e bands by km = 0.05 ± 0.01 ˚A
−1 (Fig. 3g) is in good agreement with the moir´e
period λm = 14.0 nm (Fig. 1f). We note that the momentum range of the flat band (2p0) in bulk
RG34 is determined by the ratio between the out-of-plane (γ1) and in-plane (γ0) nearest hopping
parameters by 2p0 = 4γ1/(
√
3aγ0), where a is the lattice constant. Here the experimentally ex-
tracted momentum range of the flat band ∆k = 0.10 ± 0.02 ˚A
−1 in R5G (see Extended Data Fig. 7
for more details) approaches that in the bulk rhombohedral graphite34. The momentum range in
which the flat band spans is larger than the moir´e superlattice vector km = 0.05 ˚A
−1, ensuring that
the moir´e bands overlap with the flat band of R5G. Such overlapping is critical for obtaining an
isolated flat band and enhancing the flat band, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3j.
Comparison between aligned and non-aligned R5G/BN samples
To further reveal the effect of the moir´e potential, we show in Fig. 4 a side-by-side com-
parison of experimental electronic structures between aligned and non-aligned R5G/BN samples.
Important to note that in order to have a fair comparison, here the measurements were performed
at the same endstation under the same experimental conditions. The moir´e bands are observed in
