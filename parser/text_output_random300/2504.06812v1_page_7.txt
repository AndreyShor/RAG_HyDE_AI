Here, Regular means the case of regular POVM op-
erators such that pω(θ) > 0, while Null means the
case of null POVM operators such that pω(θ) = 0,
where χω,i(˜θ) ≡tr[̺˜θEωLi(˜θ)].
In comparison, using
P
ω Eω =
1, we can write Q(̺θ) = P
ω Qω(̺θ), where
[Qω(̺θ)]ij = tr(̺θLiEωLj).
Appendix B: Derivation of Eq. (6).—
Since the SLD
is given by Li = 2(|∂iψθ⟩⟨ψθ| + |ψθ⟩⟨∂iψθ|), we write
χω,i(θ) = 2 ⟨ψθ|Eω|∂iψθ⟩+ 2pω(θ) ⟨∂iψθ|ψθ⟩.
Then,
[χω,i(θ)]∗χω,j(θ) = 4 ⟨∂iψθ|Jk(|ψθ⟩)|∂jψθ⟩, where
Jk(|ψθ⟩) ≡Eω |ψθ⟩⟨ψθ| Eω + [pω(θ)]2 |ψθ⟩⟨ψθ|
−pω(θ)(Eω |ψθ⟩⟨ψθ| + |ψθ⟩⟨ψθ| Eω).
(23)
Here we used ⟨∂iψθ|ψθ⟩= −⟨ψθ|∂iψθ⟩and ⟨ψθ|ψθ⟩= 1.
Inserting this into Eq. (5) and using P
ω Eω =
1, we
arrive at Eq. (6). Similarly, the null-POVM case can be
shown.
Appendix C: The gauge invariance of the SCGT.—
For |ψ′
θ⟩= eiαθ |ψθ⟩, we have |∂iψ′
θ⟩= (i∂iαθ) |ψ′
θ⟩+
eiαθ |∂iψθ⟩and M(|ψθ⟩)
=
M(|ψ′
θ⟩).
This yields
⟨∂iψ′
θ|M(|ψ′
θ⟩)|∂jψ′
θ⟩
=
⟨∂iψθ|M(|ψθ⟩)|∂jψθ⟩+ dij,
where
dij
≡
(∂iαθ)(∂jαθ) −(i∂iαθ) ⟨ψθ|∂jψθ⟩+
(i∂jαθ) ⟨∂iψθ|ψθ⟩. Here we used ⟨ψθ|M(|ψθ⟩)|∂jψθ⟩=
⟨ψθ|∂jψθ⟩and ⟨ψθ|M(|ψθ⟩)|ψθ⟩= 1.
Also we have
⟨∂iψ′
θ|∂jψ′
θ⟩= ⟨∂iψθ|∂jψθ⟩+ dij.
Inserting these into
Eq. (6), we ﬁnd that C(|ψ′
θ⟩) = C(|ψθ⟩). Similarly, the
null-POVM case can be shown.
Appendix D: Extension of Eq. (8) to each measurement
outcome.—
Here we show that
Cω(̺θ) ≤Qω(̺θ),
∀ω,
(24)
holds, where both terms were considered in Appendix A.
Notice that Eq. (8) is recovered when summing over
POVM operators in Eq. (24).
According to Eq. (24),
the saturation condition for the inequality (8) is reduced
to that for every measurement outcome, meaning that
C(̺θ) = Q(̺θ) if and only if Cω(̺θ) = Qω(̺θ) for all ω.
For the regular-POVM case, Eq. (24) is obtained by us-
ing the same Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as in the proof of
Observation 1, i.e., |tr(X†Y )|2 ≤tr(XX†)tr(Y Y †) with
X = √Eω√̺θ and Y = √Eω ˜L√̺θ and ˜L = P
i ziLi.
The necessary and suﬃcient condition for Cω(̺θ) =
Qω(̺θ) is the saturation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequal-
ity for all possible choice of z, i.e., the existence of com-
plex coeﬃcients µω,i such that
Eω̺θ = µω,iEωLi̺θ,
∀i.
(25)
For the null-POVM case, one can ﬁrst observe that
all the eigenvectors of ̺θ lies in the kernel of Eω,
i.e., Eω̺θ
=
̺θEω
=
0.
Using the observation
and the deﬁnition of the SLD, a similar manipulation
to Ref. [48] shows that ∂ipω(θ) = Re[tr(Li̺θEω)] =
0,
∂i∂jpω(θ)
=
{[Qω(̺θ)]ij + [Qω(̺θ)]ji}/4,
and
∂iχω,j(θ) = (1/2)[Qω(̺θ)]ij. Inserting these for the Tay-
lor expansions of pω(˜θ) and χω,j(˜θ) in Eq. (22) yields
pω(˜θ) = δθT Qω(̺θ)δθ and χω,j(˜θ) = P
ij[Qω(̺θ)]ijδθi,
where δθ = ˜θ −θ. Then,
z†Cω(̺θ)z = |z†Qω(̺θ)δθ|2
δθT Qω(̺θ)δθ .
(26)
We apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality |tr(X†Y )|2 ≤
tr(XX†)tr(Y Y †) for the numerator in Eq. (26). Taking
X = √Eω ˆL√̺θ and Y = √Eω ˜L√̺θ with ˆL = P
i δθiLi
and ˜L = P
i ziLi, we obtain
|z†Qω(̺θ)δθ|2≤[z†Qω(̺θ)z] · [δθT Qω(̺θ)δθ].
(27)
This immediately leads to Cω(̺θ) ≤Qω(̺θ). The neces-
sary and suﬃcient condition for Cω(̺θ) = Qω(̺θ) is the
saturation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for all pos-
sible choice of z, i.e., the existence of complex coeﬃcients
µω,ij such that
EωLi̺θ = µω,ijEωLj̺θ,
∀i, j.
(28)
Appendix E: Saturation of Eq. (8) in the regular-
POVM case.—
Let Eω = P
α eω,α |πω,α⟩⟨πω,α| be the
spectral decomposition of a general POVM element, with
eω,α ≥0 and the eigenstates |πω,α⟩being not necessar-
ily orthogonal for diﬀerent ω. Considering the spectral
decomposition ̺θ = P
x λx,θ |ψx,θ⟩⟨ψx,θ|, with λx,θ ≥0,
we can thus rewrite Eq. (25) as
X
x,α
λx,θeω,α ⟨πω,α|1−µω,iLi|ψx,θ⟩|πω,α⟩⟨ψx,θ|=0. (29)
Due to the linear independence among the set of op-
erators {|πω,α⟩⟨ψx,θ|}x,α, Eq. (29) can be fulﬁlled if and
only if each term in the bracket is equal to zero. This
can be seen more explicitly by projecting on the right
and left side of Eq. (29) over a complete basis. In other
words, the condition Eq. (29) is equivalent to asking the
corresponding matrix to be null for any possible choice of
basis, which is only possible if the bracket term vanishes.
Without loss of generality, we can restrict to rank-
one POVM operator Eω = |πω⟩⟨πω|.
The necessary
and suﬃcient condition is therefore the existence of a
coeﬃcient µω,i such that ⟨πω|ψx,θ⟩= µω,i ⟨πω|Li|ψx,θ⟩,
for all i and x.
This condition becomes equivalent to
⟨πω|Li|ψx,θ⟩/ ⟨πω|ψx,θ⟩= ⟨πω|Li|ψy,θ⟩/ ⟨πω|ψy,θ⟩for all
i and x, y, which immediately leads to Eq. (10) using the
formula tr(A)tr(B) = tr(A ⊗B).
Appendix F: Saturation of Eq. (8) in the null-POVM
case.—
Following Appendix E, we consider the spectral
decomposition of Eω and ̺θ. It is then suﬃces to con-
sider rank-one null POVM operators such that Eq. (28)
