Figure 22: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) results for (a) HOSVD (left column) and (b)
SVD (right column) across LSTM architectures. From top to bottom: predictions for
LSTM with 1 Dense, 2 Dense, and Time-Distributed architectures for the 3D cylinder
flow. Histograms have been constructed using 50 bins.
