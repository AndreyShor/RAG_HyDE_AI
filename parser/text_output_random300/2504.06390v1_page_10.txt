Results
In this section, we analyze the influence of the polaron effect on the linear and nonlinear
optical properties of a graphene monolayer as a function of incident photon energy. The
parameters of the substrates used in the simulations are listed in Table 1, while additional
simulation parameters are adopted from previous studies:4 ne = 1013 cm−2, nr = 2.0, I =

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the zero-energy Landau level branches (E0+ and E0−) as
a function of magnetic field strength for four polar substrates: h-BN, SiC, SiO2, and HfO2.
Panels (a) and (b) correspond to the cases without (F = 0) and with (F = 0.3 V/nm) an
applied in-plane electric field, respectively.
In the absence of the electric field (Figure 1(a)), the energy splitting between the branches
increases sharply for low magnetic field values and then saturates for B ≳1 T. This behavior
is a direct signature of the polaronic gap opening at the zero Landau level, driven by inter-
actions between graphene charge carriers and the substrate’s surface optical (SO) phonons.
The magnitude of this gap depends on two key substrate parameters: the phonon energy
ℏωSO and the polarization parameter η, which quantifies the strength of the electron-phonon
coupling.
The substrates do not follow a simple trend.
For example, although HfO2 has the
largest η among the materials considered (suggesting strong coupling), it exhibits the smallest
energy gap. In contrast, SiO2 shows the widest splitting despite a lower η. This apparent
contradiction highlights a subtle competition: a higher η enhances coupling, but a low ℏωSO
reduces the phonon-mediated energy shift. In the case of HfO2, its low value ℏωSO = 72meV
