We will use the following notation. The index j labels
the energy intervals, defined by Emin(j) ≤E ≤Emax(j).
The total number of microstates sampled for the jth in-
terval is indicated by Nj = P
E nj(E), where nj(E) is
the number of microstates with energy E sampled for
interval j.
The above quantities can be related to the density of
states via:
⟨nj(E)⟩
Nj
=
( W (E)
Zj ,
if Emin(j) ≤E ≤Emax(j).
0,
otherwise.
(5)
where the ⟨⟩brackets denote the average over various
realizations (sampling runs) and:
Zj =
X
Emin(j)≤E≤Emax(j)
W(E)
(6)
Thus, by inverting the relationship of eq. 5 one has
that the ratio nj(E)/Nj provides an estimator of W(E)
up to a multiplicative constant.
Note that an independent estimator for W(E) can be
obtained for each of the intervals covering the same en-
ergy level, E. These independent estimates can be com-
bined into an optimal weighted average:
W(E) =
′
X
j
αj(E)nj(E)
Nj
Zj ,
(7)
where the prime indicates that the sum is restricted to
intervals that include E. For our purposes, the optimal
αs are those minimizing the error on the weighted sum.
The variational calculation yields:
αj ∝
1
δnj(E)2 · N 2
j
Z2
j
,
(8)
and the proportionality coefficient is fixed by the con-
straint P′
j αj = 1.
Assuming that the microstates in each interval are
sampled uniformly and using binomial statistics argu-
ments, the variance of nj(E) can be written as:
δnj(E)2 = gj⟨nj(E)⟩

1 −⟨nj(E)⟩
Nj

(9)
where the factor gj = 1 + 2τj accounts for the pos-
sible finite autocorrelation time, τj, of the microstate
sampling process [52]. When samples are uncorrelated,
e.g. when obtained from independent quantum annealing
runs, then gj = 1.
Combining expressions of eqs. 5, 8 and 9 yields:
W(E) =

Note that the density of states can be reconstructed only
up to a multiplicative constant, which can be set by im-
posing the normalization condition:

W(E) = 1 .
(11)
The sought Ws in the desired energy range are ob-
tained by treating eq. 10 as a set of self-consistent equa-
tions to be solved iteratively. The procedure, its algorith-
mic formulation and convergence are presented in Sup-
porting Information Section S1.
From the reconstructed W(E) profile, the canonical
expectation value of a generic observable, O, at temper-
ature T can be obtained via thermodynamic reweighting
[51, 53]:
⟨O⟩T =
P
E⟨O⟩E W(E)e−βE
P
E W(E)e−βE
(12)
where β = (kB T)−1 and ⟨O⟩E and ⟨O⟩T are the averages
of O at fixed energy E and temperature T, respectively.
Again, the mentioned summand-sorting procedure may
be necessary for numerical precision.
We note that, though the optimally weighted averaging
of eq. 8 is inspired by conventional histogram reweight-
ing methods [49–51], the two reconstruction approaches
are fundamentally different. In the conventional case, re-
covering the density of states requires undoing the Boltz-
mann weight of overlapping histograms, collected at dif-
ferent temperatures, covering the energy range of in-
terest. The position and width of the histograms can-
not be enforced a priori because they are system- and
temperature-dependent and hence need to be chosen
through tentative or pre-conditioning runs. Instead, in
our scheme, the sampling can be expressly directed at
user-defined energy intervals of desired width position,
thus facilitating the coverage of the energy range of in-
terest.

Error analysis
To estimate the errors of the reconstructed W(E), we
resort to a block-like analysis that makes it straightfor-
ward to account for the correlations between the njs, Zs,
and Ws. For simplicity, we assume that all addressed
energy intervals are covered with the same ”sampling
depth,” Nj = N, and that the sampled states are un-
correlated (τj = 0).
For each interval, we subdivide
the samples into s blocks of equal size, N/s. Next, we
carry out s reconstructions of the density of states, using
for each interval the first block, then the second, and so
on, obtaining a total of s independent (normalized) pro-
files, W1(E), W2(E), . . . , Ws(E). The final W profile and
its statistical uncertainty are obtained by computing the
mean of the Wi=1,...,s and the associated statistical error
for each value of E.
