Simulated dataset before and after preprocessing
In figures S1 and S2, the simulated dataset before and after preprocessing are summarised. In each figure, the
upper three panels show the histograms of the average number of passes, the ensemble and temporal average
of OF area, and the average relative frequency of passes that went to the wider side. The lower three panels
indicated the relative frequency among 500 simulated games of the events that terminated the simulated game.
The figure indicates the limited influence of the preprocessing on the distributions.
