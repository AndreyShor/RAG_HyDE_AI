FIG. 8: Bin-by-bin uncertainty in the unfolded results from IBU-UniFold, UniFold, and MultiFold, excluding effects
of correlations among bins. The neural network (NN) uncertainty indicates the standard error due to just the neural
networkâ€™s stochastic training process, obtained by running the procedure 5 separate times. The MultiFold result
contains generally lower uncertainties than IBU-UniFold. We also note that the NN uncertainty from UniFold is
lower than that of MultiFold in the transverse variables, which is expected as a result of the simpler classifier
problem that UniFold faces.
