Figure 7: Temperature distributions predicted by the physics-informed KAN PointNet along the surface of the cylinder for
the octagon with Ω = 31◦(first row), the heptagon with Ω = 6◦(second row), and the nonagon with Ω = 26◦(third row),
shown for different Jacobi polynomial degrees (first column) and various values of 𝛼and 𝛽in the Jacobi polynomials (second
column). Here, 𝑛𝑠= 0.5 is used. The angle 𝜃is defined with reference to the positive 𝑥-axis and increases counterclockwise
(or decreases clockwise). See Table 1 and the text for the definition of Ω.
for PI-KAN-PointNet. Additionally, we observe that the pressure variable exhibits local errors on both the inner and
outer boundaries. This is because no pressure boundary condition is imposed in the loss function (see Eq. 30), as
pressure is an implicit variable in the Navier-Stokes equations [123]. Beyond the mathematical and physical reasoning
behind the relatively higher local errors at the boundaries, this observation can also be interpreted from a computer
graphics perspective. Considering the original application of PointNet for three-dimensional point cloud segmentation
[41], boundary points of an object are among the critical points, meaning that they contribute most significantly to
the geometric features learned by the network through a max-pooling operation (see, e.g., Fig. 7 and Fig. 17 of Ref.
