Having clarified the formalism and the figures of merit,
we can now focus on the target ranging protocol, and
compare the performance of quantum and classical probe
states.

APPLICATION: COVERT TARGET
RANGING
The problem of target ranging can be expressed as a
m−hypoteses test, as in Eq. (4) with
ρj := ρ(j)
κ
⊗
m−1
O
i̸=j
ρ(i)
B ,
(10)
where the tensor product structure denotes the m slots
of the state, ρB is the state of the background and
ρκ = Eκ,µB(ρ0) is the returning signal after the inter-
action with the channel and the mixing with the back-
ground, described by the quantum channel Eκ,µB. Our
analysis focuses on the optical regime and we choose to
model the interaction as proposed in Ref. [9], i.e. a pure
loss channel of reflectance κ followed by an incoherent
mixing with a large number of background modes hav-
ing a total number of photons µB. Here, the idea is to
describe a situation in which the modal structure of the
returning signal is unpredictable and non-stationary, due
to target and environment scattering, and the detector
integrates over many spatial-temporal modes in order to
maximize the collection efficiency. In this varying multi-
modal scenario it is also natural to expect phase informa-
tion to be hardly preserved. So, here we consider photon
counting measurement, motivated by the fact that inter-
ferometric approaches would be not useful. Fixing the
measurement to photon-counting means that the quan-
tum hypothesis testing on the states is translated in a
classical testing on the photon number distributions.
Denoting the photon number distribution at the re-
ceiver when the target is present as Pκ and PB when it is
not, then the target ranging Chernoff information is [9]:
ξ(A) = 2B(Pκ, PB),
(11)
where B(P0, P1) := C1/2(P0, P1) is the Bhattacharyya
information.
Since Eve operates in the same regime as Alice we fix
the same conditions for both, i.e. same interaction model
with target and background, and the same restriction to
phase-insensitive measurements. Further justification for
this latter restriction is given by the fact that Alice can
randomize the probe phase to prevent Eve from extract-
ing further information with phase measurements. Eves
best performance will be then characterized by the rate:
ξ(E) = max
0≤α≤1 Cα(P1−κ, PB).

gray area denotes the region in which effective covertness (see
main text) is allowed. The blue and red regions denote quan-
tum and classical achievable sensing respectively. For panel
A we set κ = 0.2, µB = 10, ηA = ηE = 1. The parameters are
the same in panel B except Eve’s reduced collection efficiency
ηE = 0.3.

Sensing-Covertness Trade-off
We investigate the quantities ξ(A) and ξ(B) in different
parameter settings. We compare the performance in the
task of covert target ranging of the class of “classical”
probes [39], i.e. convex combinations of coherent states,
with probes in “quantum” states of light. Since we con-
sider phase insensitive measurements we use as a classical
benchmark a probe in a coherent state ρcla = |α⟩⟨α| with
µ = |α|2 mean photons. This state has a Poisson photon
number distribution. At optical frequencies, the back-
ground is strongly multi-mode, each mode occupied with
a low mean photon number, thus the photon-counting
statistics can be approximated by a Poisson distribution
[9], with mean µB. Alice’s performance in the ranging
task is, according to Eq.(11) [9]:
ξ(A)
cla = κηAµ + 2µB −2√µB
√µB + κηAµ
