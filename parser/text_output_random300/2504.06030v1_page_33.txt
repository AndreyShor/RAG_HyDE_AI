Friedman, Ref. [5], 1037.10), ζ′ = −℘and σ′
σ = ζ.
If the orbit is confined to the well, u ∈(b, a), our θ cycle will include a ˙θ sign reversal if
C
B ∈(b, a). When this is so and △θ is small compared to π, we get very loopy motions
as shown in the diagrams of Ref. [27]. When a or b equals C
B , the motion is cusped and
sinusoidal if C
B /∈(b, a). When |B| ∼0, orbits will look like Newton’s revolving orbits.
Needless to say the last theorem embodies an implicit equation for our KLMN orbit,
