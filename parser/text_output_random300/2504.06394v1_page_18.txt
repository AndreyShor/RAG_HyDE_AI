Relaxation of the Cupula
Underdamping for high St 
Input-output phase diﬀerence
Figure 8: Left panel: Solution to (5.7), when 𝑓(𝑡) = 0 and Δ𝑝0(𝑡= 0) = 1 for different
values of the Stokes number, showing underdamped dynamics for large enough St. Central
panel: Bifurcation diagram, showing the evolution of Re( ¯𝜔) (blue) and Im( ¯𝜔) (red).
Markers represent the numerically obtained solution from (5.8) and dashed lines the
analytical approximation (5.9). Right panel: bifurcation diagram for 𝑓(𝑡) ∼𝑒2𝜋𝑖𝑡,
showing how the transition between the two regimes Δ𝑝0 ∼𝐹(𝑡) and Δ𝑝0 ∼𝑓(𝑡) depends
on both 𝜅and St. Colour represents the complex angle of 𝜒, with blue arg(𝜒) = 𝜋/2 and
red representing arg(𝜒) = 0.
To transform this equation into a more manageable form, we define a complete kernel
K(𝑥; St) = St−1 Í∞
𝑛=1 𝜆−2
𝑛𝑒−𝜆2
𝑛𝑥/St. Finally, we may directly substitute Δ𝑝0 from (5.4b) into
(5.3) to obtain a single equation for the cupular deflection 𝜂0(𝑟, 𝑡):

Equation (5.6) is an integro-PDE for 𝜂with an exponential-like kernel. Seeking a separable
solution 𝜂0 = ¯𝜂(𝑟)Δ𝑝0 when 𝜚≪1 will lead to an integro-differential equation for Δ𝑝0(𝑡)

(5.7)
Here, ¯𝜂and 𝛼(𝑏) are the same as in the St ≪1 limit, given in (3.10). Equation (5.7) may be
efficiently solved numerically by truncating the infinite series in the kernel and transforming
the integral equation into a system of ODEs. This is a standard calculation, with details given
in Appendix B.
5.2. Fluid inertia can make the cupula underdamped
To understand the effect of inertia in the cupular response, we first consider the case of a
cupula that is initially stretched by a pressure jump Δ𝑝0(𝑡= 0) = 1 in a frame rotating at
constant speed, so that 𝑓(𝑡) = 0.
The numerical solution to (5.7) for a range of Stokes numbers is given in Figure 8(a).
Notice that for sufficiently large St, Δ𝑝(𝑡) exhibits decaying oscillatory behaviour, meaning
that the cupula is underdamped; this is in contrast to smaller values of St, in which the cupula
dynamics show an exponential decay whose rate of decay increases with St.
To understand this change in behaviour as St is increased, we seek an exponential ansatz
to solve (5.7), with Δ𝑝0 ∼𝑒−𝜔𝑡in the simple case when 𝑓(𝑡) = 0. Direct substitution yields
