may be missed, network-based intrusion detection could be com-
promised, and a strategically positioned attacker could manipulate
data at individual vantage points. To address these issues, intrusion
detection systems should incorporate multiple vantage points while
minimizing communication overhead between them.
Challenge 4 – Vantage Points
To ensure reliable intrusion detection, multiple vantage points
should be considered while minimizing the resulting communi-
cation overhead.
Multiple vantage points can also help in localizing and under-
standing the origin of an anomaly. In addition to confirming that
these effects are due to a cyberattack, IIDSs should ideally assist
in localizing the attack’s origin. While actionability is, in general,
desirable for IIDSs [11], power grids span vast geographical ar-
eas, making it time-consuming to travel between substations and
investigate potential signs of an attack (e.g., compromised devices).
Challenge 5 – Actionability
IIDSs should not only detect attacks but also aid in understanding
and pinpointing their origin, facilitating a quick resolution.
Finally, different intrusion detection mechanisms are required to
detect attacks as reliably as possible [20]. Process-aware intrusion
detection can quickly identify anomalous behavior, even in the
absence of changes in network traffic, such as when a supply chain
attack compromises an RTU that confirms but does not execute
commands. In contrast, network-based mechanisms may detect
the attachment of new devices to the network (e.g., by observing
unexpected ARP requests), thereby identifying attacks before they
manipulate the process. Meanwhile, host-based mechanisms may
detect manipulated firmware in advance.
Challenge 6 – Multi-layer Intrusion Detection
A holistic surveillance of power grids is only achievable by com-
bining process-aware, network-based, and host-based intrusion
detection. These approaches should ideally complement and sup-
port each other to enhance detection performance.

Conclusion
We present the Sherlock dataset to advance research on process-
aware intrusion detection in power grids. The dataset encompasses
three scenarios of realistically sized power grids, passively cap-
turing network traffic at multiple vantage points during normal
operations and periods influenced by cyberattacks. We extract pro-
cess state information using human-readable data point identifiers
in the IPAL format. This format also facilitates testing and valida-
tion, as demonstrated by our evaluation of five general-purpose
industrial intrusion detection methods on the dataset. Our initial
findings identify six key challenges for intrusion detection research
for power grids, such as overlapping cyclic behaviors based on time
of day, season, and weather, which complicate the identification of
benign characteristics. We envision that the Sherlock dataset will
assist the research community in tackling these challenges in the
future and thus contribute to the security of critical infrastructures.
