The same results were also proved in [CSZ17] for the solution uε of the mollified SHE (1.1)
on the intermediate disorder scale βε “ ˆβ

log 1{ε. Therefore in the subcritical regime ˆβ ă 1,
the 2D SHE is essentially the Edwards-Wilkinson equation.
It is the critical regime ˆβ “ 1 that leads to a non-Gaussian limit, called the Critical 2D
Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF). It turns out there is a whole critical window around ˆβ “ 1,
determined by the relation

For a more explicit expression of βN in terms of ϑ, see [CSZ23a, (3.12)]. For the mollifed
SHE (1.1), the corresponding critical window is given by

where ϱ “ πϑ ` C (see [CSZ19b, (1.38)] for the precise value of C).
The main result of [CSZ23a] is that:
‚ If βN is chosen to satisfy (1.5) for some ϑ P R and upNqpt, ¨q is regarded as a process of
random measures on R2, then pupNqpt, ¨qqtě0 converges in finite dimensional distribution
to a unique (in law) measure-valued process Z ϑ
t pdxq, called the Critical 2D Stochastic
Heat Flow.
For simplicity, here we only consider constant initial configuration Z ϑ
0 pdxq “ dx.
Recently, Tsai [Tsa24] showed that the solution uε of the mollified SHE (1.1) also converges
to the Critical 2D SHF constructed in [CSZ23a]. The proof is based on an axiomatic
characterisation of the Critical 2D SHF as the unique (in law) continuous measure-valued
process that satisfies: (i) Independent “increments” property; (ii) An almost sure Chapman-
Kolmogorov property (proved for the SHF by Clark-Mian [CM24]); (iii) matching first four
moments with the Critical 2D SHF (first computed in [BC98, CSZ17, GQT21] before the
construction of the SHF in [CSZ23a]).
We also recall from [CSZ23a, Theorem 1.2] some basic properties of the Critical 2D SHF:
‚ (Scaling Covariance) For all a ą 0, we have
pZ ϑ

(1.7)
Thus zooming out diffusively (a Ò 8) increases the disorder strength ϑ, while zooming
in (a Ó 0) decreases the disorder strength (cf. the pictures on the front page, where
the picture on the right is a result of zooming into the picture on the left).
‚ (First and Second Moments) We have

where Kϑ

the realisation that this lies in the critical window of a phase transition [CSZ17].
