This is a truncated Gamma(2, 1/σ2) distribution, shifted by log(δk).
The truncation is
negligible in the asymptotic regime τ →∞under the assumption τ·δk →∞, since this implies
log(δk) = o(log(τ)). Therefore, the median of Y converges to that of the full Gamma(2, 1/σ2)
distribution. The median m of a Gamma(2, 1/σ2) distribution satisﬁes the implicit equation

which yields the asymptotic solution
m = σ2 log(2) + σ2 log (τ · δk) + o(1),
reﬂecting the fact that the mass of the distribution is concentrated at y = O(log(τ)). Re-
turning to the original variable X0 = Y + log(ǫ), we conclude that
Med(X0 | Xτ ̸= −∞, B = k) = log(ǫ) + log(2) + log(τ · δk) + R(τ),
where R(τ) →0 as τ →∞.
