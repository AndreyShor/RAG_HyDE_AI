achieve more than 10 times reduction in computational time
as compared to the state-of-the-art SEA utilizing CVX and
attains the same SE performance. As for the dense scenario of
K = 30 UEs, the proposed algorithm brings an 88 % reduction
in computational time while achieving a small improvement
in SE.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper addresses the MMF multicast optimization prob-
lem in a massive MIMO system. We develop a fast SDP-
ADMM algorithm that can achieve a near-global optimal
rank-1 beamforming solution to this NP-hard problem. The
proposed solution relies on the SEA to extract a rank-1
solution from the output of the SDP. A novel problem reformu-
lation and penalization scheme is proposed that is specifically
tailored for our SDP-ADMM implementation. The distinction
of the proposed algorithm is that it is applicable to a wide-class
of optimization problems where SDR is utilized and a low-
rank solution is desirable. Compared to standard SDP solvers,
SDP-ADMM attains similar SE performance with about 10
times reduction in computational time. Numerical results show
the robustness of the proposed SDP-ADMM algorithm where
it maintains its performance for different simulation settings
without the need for ADMM parameter tuning.
