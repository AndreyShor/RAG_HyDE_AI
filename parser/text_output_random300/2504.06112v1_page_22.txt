FIG. 10: Time evolution in Monte Carlo Steps (MCS) of the average resources of
cooperators and defectors across the entire system and within ΥSDG and ΥPDG. The left
column (panels (a) and (d)) shows the system-wide evolution of average resources for both
cooperators and defectors. The central column (panels (b) and (e)) focuses on the same
observable within ΥSDG, while the right column (panels (c) and (f)) presents the
corresponding evolution within ΥPDG. The top row (panels (a)–(c)) corresponds to the
parameter set σ = 0.2, µ = 0.5, whereas the bottom row (panels (d)–(f)) corresponds to
σ = 0.5, µ = 0.2. The remaining control parameter is set to b = 1.10.
in cooperators’ average resources decreases, leading to a reduced gap between cooperators
and defectors. The second and third columns of Fig. 10 and Fig. A3 show the evolution of
the average resources of cooperators and defectors in ΥSDG and ΥPDG, respectively. The
trends observed in ΥSDG closely follow those seen in the entire system. Additionally, for
µ = 0, 0.2, 0.5, cooperators and defectors in ΥSDG maintain average resource levels above
1, whereas in ΥPDG, the average resource levels remain below 1. At any fixed value of µ,
the average resources in ΥSDG are consistently higher than those in ΥPDG. However, as
µ increases, the average resources in ΥPDG increase, while those in ΥSDG slightly decrease,
