ANGULAR SCAN SPEED
In the previous sections, we explored some of the ef-
fects on optical performance of departures from gaussian
optics, and presented our timing measurements. Here, we
explore the only notable temperature-dependent factor,
which is the marked reduction in pulse duration between
the warm and cold tests. The reduction in pulse width
as a function of wavelength in the 10 mK data is entirely
explained by the change in spot size observed with the
CCD, meaning the pulse width change is not an optical
effect, but a result of a change in MEMs mirror respon-
sivity.
During warm testing, we noted a marked variability in
observed pulse duration that was not strongly correlated
with any one variable. Pulse width tests were performed
with the system on the bench, installed in the cryostat
(first open and then under vacuum), and even as a func-
tion of temperature during different stages of cooling to
10 mK. The quoted warm pulse widths correspond to the
shortest stable values observed between 4 K and 300 K.
After cooling to 10 mK, the measured pulse widths de-
creased by 20–50% for each wavelength, with the results
for the lowest stable pulse widths at 300 K quoted in
Table I. Rather than a gradual decrease, consistent with
a continuous impedance change in the MEMS system,
there was a discrete shift in performance when the sys-
tem was heated from < 1 K to 4 K. We attribute this
change to the aluminum control lines on the MEMs mir-
ror going through their superconducting transition, re-
sulting in increased drive bandwidth, as the RC network
of the MEMs mirror becomes purely capacitive.
We can use the detailed spot size measurements ac-
quired with the 660 nm diode to back out the effective
change in MEMs scan speed, removing the optical effects
we have described earlier and compensating for any fo-
cal length drift. The measured pulse width decreased by
∼40%, i.e.
far more than the observed ∼3% decrease
in RMS spot size. For a more accurate comparison, we
calculated the change in spot width along the scanning
direction (X) without removing the effect of the output
fiber. As seen in Figure 6, the result for 660 nm was a
larger total decrease of ∼10%, still less than the observed
decrease in pulse width. The remaining effect after com-
pensating for the spot size change thus reflects the change
in mirror speed.
By comparing the the 660 nm pulse width to spot
size in the scanning direction, we estimate linear scan
speeds of 24.5 m/s warm and 31.6 m/s cold. Including
the scanning lever arm (la = 84 mm), we convert these
scan speeds to angular velocities of ξ ∼292 rad/s warm
and 376 rad/s cold. Although full measurements were
only done for 660 nm, the resulting scan speeds should
be wavelength-independent.
If we further assume that the mirror sweeps through its
full angular range, we can estimate the effective oscilla-
tion frequency the mirror attains during the drive signal
and compare this to the resonant frequency quoted for
the system when warm. From Appendix B, we find that:
vmax = laξ = la2θmω
(10)
which implies for 2θm = 10 degrees = 0.175 rad an os-
cillation frequency of ω/2π ∼265 Hz warm and 341 Hz
cold. This result essentially implies we are driving the
mirror as fast as mechanically possible.

DISCUSSION
This paper presents detailed, device-agnostic char-
acterization of an enhanced cryogenic MEMs steering
and optical chopping system over the range 365 nm to
970 nm. While the electrical and enclosure design is iden-
tical to the original system described in Ref [14], we have
demonstrated substantial improvements to the optical fo-
cuser design. As a result, we expanded system capabili-
ties by almost an order of magnitude in wavelength, and
demonstrated spot sizes smaller than 100 µm across this
entire range. We also demonstrated robust optical chop-
ping capability across the majority of the spectral range
with performance limited by the mechanical properties of
the MEMs mirror and its demonstrated optical behavior.
While not discussed in detail here thus far, one of the
main advantages of this technique is the high degree of
control fidelity achievable at practically zero power dissi-
pation. For all of the measurements described in this pa-
per, MEMs-related heating was typically negligible, and
full-scale chopping modulation was retained as we added
filtering to the MEMS control circuit.
For these mea-
surements, the observed heating is consistent with the
expected heat load from optical absorption in the sys-
tem and within the fibers, and did not correlate with
movement speed or frequency.
Forthcoming measure-
ments using this second-generation MEMS scanning sys-
tem with phonon-sensitive KIDs[16] and charge-sensitive
superconducting devices should confirm the negligible
thermal impact this versatile characterization technique
has on real-world device performance.
