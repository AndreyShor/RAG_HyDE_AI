1. Introduction 
Resonant nanophotonic structures are widely used in optical biosensing, where changes in the 
surrounding refractive index produce measurable shifts in the optical spectrum 1-18. These shifts 
are typically tracked through single resonance peaks or simplified one-dimensional fitting routines 
that monitor only a small portion of the spectrum. While these methods are practical and 
interpretable, they inherently overlook the rich spectral features that span across broader 
wavelength ranges and may contain valuable sensing information. 
Machine learning has been increasingly used across scientific domains, including biosensing, 
to uncover patterns in complex data and enhance predictive performance 19-26. In our prior work27, 
we introduced a machine learning approach that used multiple pre-selected resonance peak shifts 
as inputs for ridge regression. That method significantly reduced mean squared error in refractive 
index prediction, outperforming conventional single-feature techniques by orders of magnitude. 
However, it still required manual feature selection and was limited to spectra with well-defined 
peaks. 
In parallel, the advancement of optical sensing hardware has been accelerated by the 
development of metamaterials. These are artificially structured materials engineered to manipulate 
electromagnetic waves beyond the capabilities of naturally occurring media28. Metasurfaces 
represent the two-dimensional class of metamaterials and offer powerful control over phase, 
amplitude, and polarization29-33. Among them, meta-gratings are periodic metasurfaces with  a 
wide range of applications and are highly suited for biosensing applications due to their strong 
spectral sensitivity and tunability34. 
In this work, we explore whether full-spectrum machine learning, without manual feature 
selection, or peak selection, can improve prediction accuracy across different spectral response 
types. We simulate a meta-grating structure consisting of triangular nanorods on a gold reflector, 
where the rod material is set to either Ti (Ti) or Si (Si). Ti supports broadband intensity spectrum 
modulation, while Si supports narrowband shifting Mie-type resonances. To account for the 
anisotropy of the design, both TE and TM polarizations are simulated for each configuration. 
To evaluate generalization, we apply five-fold cross-validation by holding out different 
refractive index values during training. This mimics experimental biosensing scenarios, where
