Fig. 5. Beamsteering demonstration of the RIS at 5GHz: (a) Analytically-
deﬁned desired radiation patterns. (b) Predictions through full-wave simula-

uniform-amplitude directivity approximation of Eq. (11) is included with

• θb = 30◦:
θpass = [17◦, 43◦], θSLL = [−90◦, 10◦] ∪[50◦, 90◦],
• θb = 45◦:
θpass = [10◦, 50◦], θSLL = [−90◦, 3◦] ∪[57◦, 90◦],
• θb = 60◦:
θpass = [2◦, 58◦], θSLL = [−90◦, −6◦] ∪[66◦, 90◦].
The ﬁrst additional term in Eq. (14) quantiﬁes the variation of
the directivity within the angular pass range. On the contrary,
the second additional term acts like a penalty factor that is
nonzero when the sidelobe level (obtained as the difference
between the highest side lobe and the minimum directivity
value within the pass range) exceeds the allowable SLL level
that is set for all cases at CSLL = −12dB. For these beam-
forming cases, the radiation pattern is calculated at a radius
rd = 2.5m during the optimization process, according to what
described in Sec. II-B. Although the difference compared to
the radiation pattern in the far-ﬁeld is generally small, the aim
is to demonstrate the maximum possible accuracy compared to
the measurements that are performed in a radius of 2.5m due
to practical constraints. The optimization is performed with
a power constraint ηmin = 0.5 for all three designs and the
optimized surface impedance values are given in Fig. 6.

Beamforming demonstration of the RIS at 5GHz through 3 sector
patterns of beamwidth θb = 30◦(blue color), θb = 45◦(red color) and
θb = 60◦(green color). The ideal patterns (dashed lines) are shown alongside
with the radiation patterns predicted from full-wave simulations (solid lines).
30◦, 45◦, 60◦are plotted in Fig. 7 with dashed lines. On the
other hand, the radiation patterns (at rd = 2.5m) obtained
from full-wave simulations of the physical structure with the
optimized capacitances are shown in Fig. 7 with solid lines.
For all three cases, the sidelobes (within the range θSLL) are
limited to −12dB below the minimum value observed in the
pass range θpass. On the other hand, the variation within the
pass range is limited to 1.5dB, 2.7dB and 2.4dB, respectively.
Finally, the simulated power efﬁciency is ηp = 0.52, 0.46, 0.51
for the three designs, which is close to the constraint (and
MoM prediction for the optimized solutions) of ηp = 0.50.
C. Surface-wave excitation and beneﬁts of IE-MoM approach
In this subsection, the accuracy of the proposed integral
equation framework solved with a Method of Moments (IE-
MoM) is compared with the traditional reﬂect-array (RA)
approach that disregards any coupling effects. For the latter,
a complex reﬂection coefﬁcient Sn
11 is assigned to each one
of the 30 cells. By multiplying the incident ﬁeld with the
