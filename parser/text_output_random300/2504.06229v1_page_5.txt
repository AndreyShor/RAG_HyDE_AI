FIG. 2. 2 × 7-grid cluster state obtained with a monochro-
matic pump spectrum and a flat spatial pump distribution in
a low-coupled photonic lattice. The grid state is composed
by a pair of spectral modes l ≡s, L + 1 −l ≡i, and seven
spatial modes j = 1, . . . , 7. Solid lines stand for spectral en-
tanglement (vertical) and dotted lines stand for spatial entan-
glement (horizontal). L/2 or (L−1)/2 copies of this state are
respectively generated for an even or odd number of spectral
modes L.
Recently, we demonstrated that in the limit case of one
spectral mode (degeneracy in frequency, L = 1) the state
given by Equations (13)-(14) is a linear cluster state in
the spatial domain over a wide range of values of the
governing parameters [39, 40]. Hence, the state given by
Equations (13)-(14) can form L/2 copies of a (2×N)-grid
cluster state for an even number L of spectral modes, or
(L −1)/2 copies if L is odd. An example is shown in
Figure 2 for an homogeneous array of nonlinear waveg-
uides with N = 7 waveguides and two spectral modes
l ≡s and L+1−l ≡i. The horizontal and vertical edges
represent respectively spatial and spectral entanglement.
For instance, for L = 20 frequency bands we would have
10 copies of the 2×7 grid state of Figure 2. All copies are
generated in the same temporal mode, and can be easily
distributable in a quantum network by means of suitable
spectral demultiplexing.
We can demonstrate that the array produces this fam-
ily of states using the graph calculus for Gaussian pure
states [48].
Figure 3 shows the real (upper) part and
the trace of the imaginary part (lower) of the complex-
weighted adjacency matrix Z = V + i U obtained from
Equations (13) and (14) for N = 7 and L = 2.
The
real part V is the canonical graph of the state, whereas
the trace of the imaginary part Tr(U) is the error of the
approximation. We obtain a non-unit weight adjacency
matrix with the weight of the spectral vertices (sj : ij)
four times that of the spatial vertices (s(i)j : s(i)j±1)
(Figure 3 upper). For the parameters used in our simula-
tion there are also negligible spatio-spectral correlations
(s(i)j : i(s)j±1) more than ten times lower than the spa-
tial ones. Hence, for a given length of the array, in the
limit of low evanescent coupling and large nonlinearity,
the state given by Equations (13) and (14) resembles the
grid state of Figure 2 with the error vanishing for infinite
squeezing (Figure 3 lower). This result is expected since
for low coupling SPDC light produced in each waveg-
uide is only transferred to nearest-neighbor waveguides,
but not beyond. In the limit of high coupling the state
will present a different entanglement geometry [41]. Note
that the this analysis is applicable to any number 2 × N
of modes.

FIG. 3. Real part V (upper figure) of the complex-weighted
adjacency matrix Z = V + i U obtained from Equations (13)
and (14) [48]. V is the canonical graph of the state, whereas
the trace of the imaginary part U accounts for the error of
the approximation. The value of Tr(U) for different values of
nonlinearity is shown in the lower figure. xjl = Al
j + Al†
j is
the amplitude quadrature of a spatio-spectral mode of spatial
index j and spectral index l. The vacuum shot noise is set as
1. We have applied a π/2 rotation in idler-mode phase space
(exchange of labels of quadratures for the idler modes), and
used a homogeneous coupling profile ⃗f = ⃗1 with CM = 0.01
mm−1, g√ph = 0.05 mm−1 (upper figure) and z = 20 mm.
Absolute values of O(10−3) are not shown for the sake of
exposition.
Grid cluster states are an important resource for
measurement-based quantum computing [49].
Larger
grid cluster states can be created using temporal modes
under suitable temporal multiplexing [50, 51].
For in-
stance, we can obtain grid states composed of L × N
elements by multiplexing linear clusters in frequency and
space encodings. This state is generated at the repetition
rate of the pump laser and can be time-multiplexed by
applying delay lines. Thus, the ability to shape the pump
field in both space and frequency in a nonlinear photonic
lattice opens a wide range of possibilities to create two-
and three-dimensional cluster states, necessary respec-
tively for universal and fault-tolerant measurement-based
quantum computing [52]. For instance, suitable spatial
pump shaping can produce a closed linear cluster that
