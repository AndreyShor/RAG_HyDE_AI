12. Discussion of hot-electron extraction at ambient condition 
We think the doping-enhanced hot-electron extraction found at 10 K can be applied 
to 300 K, which can be understood as follows.  
The excess energy of hot excitons, defined as the energy difference between the 
pump photon and conduction-band edge, is about 100 meV in our experiment, which 
will lead to the effective electronic temperature much larger than the thermal energy at 
300 K (about 25 meV). In both scenarios of 10 K and 300 K, besides exciton-carrier 
interactions, the excess energy of the hot excitons is lost to the lattice through optical 
phonon emission[6]. The probability of optical phonon-emission is proportional to (𝑛𝑛+
1), where 𝑛𝑛 obeys the Bose-Einstein distribution, 1/(𝑒𝑒
ℏ𝜔𝜔
𝑘𝑘𝐵𝐵𝑇𝑇−1). kB is Boltzmann’s 
constant, T is the lattice temperature, and ℏ𝜔𝜔 is the optical phonon energy. With 
temperature increasing from 10 K to 300 K and using ℏ𝜔𝜔 of about 20 meV[7], (𝑛𝑛+
1) only varies from 1 to 1.8. Thus, in spite of some enhanced optical phonon emission,
