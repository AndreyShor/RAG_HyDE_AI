show the MHOU, while at aN3LO we also show the IHOU.
4.1.6. Results: aN3LO evolution
The aN3LO anomalous dimensions discussed in the previous sections have been implemented
in the Mellin space open-source evolution code EKO (Section 2.1.1). The parametrization
is expressed in terms of a basis of Mellin space functions which are numerically efficient to
evaluate. In order to achieve full aN3LO accuracy, in addition to the anomalous dimensions, we
have also been implemented the four-loop running of the strong coupling constant αs(Q) and
the N3LO matching conditions, as discussed in Section 1.4.2, dictating the transitions between
schemes with different numbers of active quark flavor. A special case is the a(3)
Hg entry of the
matching condition matrix, which at the time of publication was still unknown and has been
parametrized using the first 5 known moments [80] and the LLx contribution. 3
In Fig. 4.7 we compare the result of evolving a fixed set of PDFs from Q0 = 1.65 GeV up to
Q = 100 GeV at NLO, NNLO, and aN3LO. We take as input the NNPDF4.0NNLO PDF set, and
show results normalized to the aN3LO evolution. Results are shown for all the combinations
that evolve differently, as discussed in Section 4.1.1, namely the singlet, gluon, total valence
