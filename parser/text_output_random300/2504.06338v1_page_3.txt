∼O(10 keV), much less than the pair creation thresh-
old O(MeV). Therefore the NBW process can only pro-
ceed by the net absorption of high numbers photons from
the laser pulse. This means calculations must typically
include all orders of interaction between the laser and
the produced pair.
The standard approach is to cal-
culate matrix elements in the Furry picture by solving
the Dirac equation in a classical plane wave electromag-
netic background to acquire fermionic Volkov states [65].
The classical plane-wave background is used to represent
the microscopic interaction with the laser pulse; result-
ing probabilities can then be integrated over the macro-
scopic details of the laser beam. The total probability
can be calculated using an expansion of interactions be-
tween the quantised electromagnetic field and the Volkov
states.
Laser-particle experiments aim to measure the
leading-order, tree-level contribution to the NBW pro-
cess, and this is the contribution we calculate in this
work. The derivation of this leading-order process is well-
documented in the literature; for the fully-polarised case,
see [63]. (For reviews of strong-field QED see [32, 33, 66–
69]).
In this section, we define variables and give expressions
that will be useful when discussing the local approxi-
mations and numerical results.
We begin by defining
the (plane-wave) laser pulse with scaled vector poten-
tial aµ(ϕ) = |e|Aµ(ϕ) = (0, ax(ϕ), ay(ϕ), 0), wavevector
kµ = ω(1, 0, 0, −1) and laser phase ϕ = k · x, where |e| is
the charge of the positron, and ω is the laser frequency.
The photon-laser collision is characterised by the (pho-
ton) energy parameter η = k · ℓ/m2 and the intensity
parameter ξ, which enters in the definition of the vector
potential of the laser field:
aµ(ϕ) = mξ0 f(ϕ) (0, cos ϕ, c sin ϕ, 0) ,
(5)
where f(ϕ) is the pulse envelope, c = 0 is for linear po-
larisation, and c = ±1 denote circular polarisation with
the field rotation corresponding to the polarisation state
(ϵ1 + icϵ2)/
√
2 with ϵ1 = (0, 1, 0, 0), ϵ2 = (0, 0, 1, 0).
The polarisation of the incoming photon can be fully
described with a 2 × 2 density matrix as
|γ; ℓ, ε⟩⟨γ; ℓ, ε| =
X
λ,λ′=±
ργ,λλ′|ℓ, ελ⟩⟨ℓ, ελ′| ,
(6)
where the polarisation basis [70]:
εµ
± =ϵµ
± −ℓ· ϵ±
k · ℓkµ ,
(7)
is used, satisfying the relations ℓ· ε± = 0 and k · ε± = 0,
with ϵ± = (ϵ1±iϵ2)/
√
2. The subscript ‘λ = ±’ marks the
rotation direction of the polarisation state: λ = +1 is for
right-hand polarisation and λ = −1 for left-hand polari-
sation, where the photon is right-hand polarised when the
angular momentum is parallel to the direction of its prop-
agation, and left-handed when anti-parallel [71].
The
photon’s polarisation density matrix can be expressed ex-
plicitly as:
ργ = 1
2

1 + Γ3
Γ1 −iΓ2
Γ1 + iΓ2
1 −Γ3

.
(8)
The (normalised) Stokes parameters (Γ1, Γ2, Γ3) mea-
sure both the direction and degree of the photon po-
larisation; Γ3 is the degree of the circular polarisation,
and Γ1 (Γ2) is the linear polarisation degree: Γ1 = +1
(−1) corresponds to the complete polarisation along x
(y)-direction and Γ2 = +1 (−1) corresponds to the com-
plete polarisation along 45◦(135◦)-direction in the x-y
plane [71]. The total polarisation degree of the photon
beam is given as Γ = (Γ2
1 + Γ2
2 + Γ2
3)1/2 where 0 ≤Γ ≤1;
Γ = 1 means a completely polarised photon, and Γ = 0 an
unpolarised photon. Again, the selection of polarisation
basis is arbitrary, and selecting a different polarisation
basis changes only the elements of ργ, but not measur-
able physical quantities.
The electron and positron are produced in Volkov
states with bispinors up,σ and vq,ς respectively (explicit
expressions are presented in Appendix. A). We use the
lightfront spin quantisation axis defined by:
Sµ
p = pµ
m −m
k · pkµ ,
(9)
for the electron and with the replacement p →q for the
positron.
The spin correlation density matrix and production
probability can be parametrised using combinations of
lightfront momenta. We use commonly-chosen variables
for the NBW process: s = k · q/k · ℓis the positron light-
front momentum fraction (0 ≤s ≤1) and r = (rx, ry),
and rx,y = qx,y/m −sℓx,y/m is the ‘transverse’ positron
momentum in the plane perpendicular to the laser propa-
gating direction. Conservation of one component of light-
front momentum is expressed by s + t = 1, where t is the
electron lightfront momentum fraction.
The photon-polarised probability, Pb, for NBW can be
written as [72]:

where α is the fine structure constant.
The exponent
is semi-classical; it contains the classical solution of the
momentum of a positron in a plane electromagnetic
wave: πq(ϕ) = qµ −aµ(ϕ) + [q · a(ϕ)/k · q −a2(ϕ)/2k ·
q]kµ. The pre-exponent contains the kinematic variable
hs = (s2 + t2)/(4st), the laser-field dependent variable
∆a = [a(ϕ1) −a(ϕ2)]/m and the mixed variables R =
i[wx(ϕ1)wy(ϕ2) −wy(ϕ1)wx(ϕ2)], n1 = wy(ϕ1)wy(ϕ2) −
wx(ϕ1)wx(ϕ2) and n2 = −wx(ϕ1)wy(ϕ2)−wy(ϕ1)wx(ϕ2)
where w(ϕ) = r −a⊥(ϕ)/m with a⊥= (ax, ay) that cou-
ple to different photon polarisation states. The variable
R comes from the rotation of the background field and
