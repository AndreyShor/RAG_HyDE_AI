glass subspace of solutions of the exact equations turns out to contain a line of ﬁxed points.
We then discuss the implications of the results from the point of view of universality and in
comparison with the available numerical results for the spin glass regime.
The paper is organized as follows. After recalling in the next section some main features
of the two-dimensional random bond Ising model, we derive the exact renormalization group
ﬁxed point equations in section 3. The solutions are discussed in section 4 before collecting
some ﬁnal remarks in the ﬁnal section.

Magnetic and spin glass criticality
The random bond Ising model [1] is deﬁned by the Hamiltonian
H = −
X
⟨x,y⟩
Jxy σ(x)σ(y) ,
(1)
where σ(x) = ±1 denotes the spin variable at site x of a regular lattice, P
⟨x,y⟩is the sum
over nearest neighbors, and quenched disorder is introduced through random couplings Jxy
drawn from a probability distribution P(Jxy). A common choice is the bimodal distribution
P(Jxy) = p δ(Jxy −1) + (1 −p) δ(Jxy + 1) ,
(2)
where 1 −p is the fraction of antiferromagnetic bonds.
The ordered phase of the pure
ferromagnet (p = 1) persists as the disorder strength 1 −p is increased, until the transition
temperature vanishes. The transition between this ferromagnetic phase and the paramagnetic
phase (Figure 1) is continuous, namely the correlation length ξM deﬁned by1
[⟨σ(x)σ(y)⟩]conn ∼e−|x−y|/ξM ,

diverges along the phase boundary. We refer to the divergence of ξM as magnetic criticality.
In the two-dimensional case of interest in the present paper, magnetic criticality is ruled
by the three renormalization group ﬁxed points present on the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic
phase boundary. The ﬁxed point P of the pure model is analytically known to be stable
under the addition of disorder [15, 16, 17, 18]; numerical studies [19, 20, 21, 22] show that
the zero temperature ﬁxed point Z is stable in the temperature direction, while the Nishimori
point N [23, 24, 25, 26] is unstable in all directions. Recently, the exact correlation length
and crossover critical exponents at the Nishimori point have been determined exactly (also
1We denote by ⟨· · · ⟩the thermal average and by [· · · ] the average over the random variables Jxy.
