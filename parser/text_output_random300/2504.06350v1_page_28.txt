ˆP(a, b|x, y, Vp) = p(a, b|x, y)ωab/pVp and the quantum side information can be represented by ρ ˆ
ABE|Vp =
ωab |ab⟩⟨ab| ⊗ρE
AB. Therefore, the lower bound of Eq. (71) reads
r ≥pVp[Hmin( ˆAx|E, pVp) −H( ˆAx|By, pVp)],
(66)
where H( ˆAx|By, pVp) is the cost of one-way error correction from Alice to Bob.
By optimizing the entangled state shared between Alice and Bob, along with the measurement settings
η∗= 0.685. This marks a significant improvement over the previous security proofs in Refs [57, 208, 209].
However, a coherent attack was reported in 2023 [238], demonstrating that coherent attacks are stronger
than collective ones in this protocol.
3.7.2. CHSHc protocol - deterministic key basis
CHSHc protocol is the same as CHSH protocol (Sec. 3.4), but under quantum collective attacks. A
variant allows Bob’s choices y ∈{0, 1} (or y ∈{0, 1, 2} as in E91 3.2 and [64])
so that A0 = B1 = σz, B2 = σx, A1,2 = (σz ± σx)/
√
2. Again, in CHSHc protocol [54, 57], the raw
key is extracted from the pair (x, y) = (0, 1), and QBER = Q = p(a ̸= b|01) (from Eq. (4)).
Security proof (1 way). – For one-way classical post-processing under collective attacks, rather than Eq.
(50), an asymptotic (N →∞) lower bound of the key rate is the Devetak-Winter expression
r ≥rDW = I(A0 : B1) −χ(B1 : E) = 1 −h(Q) −q −(1 −q)χ0
(67)
with χ(B1 : E) is the Holevo quantity between Eve and Bob defined in terms of von Neumann entropy

Proof. The mutual information I(A0 : B1) = 1 −h(Q) is computed assuming uniform marginals. Eq.

that bounds Eve’s information in χ. Generalization 1. If Eve has some probability q of making a correct
guess on the choice of measurement settings (a flag f = 1) so that she fixes a priori the players’ outcomes
engineering S′ = 4q + (1 −q)S (otherwise her guess is uncorrelated, f = 0), then Eq. (69) becomes
χ(B1 : E) ≤q + (1 −q)χ0 [239].
To take into account the detection loophole, the key rate in Eqs (67) and (69) must be computed
on ˆp rather than the ideal p (with ηA = ηB = 1) as discussed in Eq. (25) of Sec. 2.4.1, therefore for
ηA = ηB = η, Q = η(1 −η) and S = 2
√
2η2 + 2(1 −η)2 ( ⟨A0⟩= ⟨B0⟩= 0 in Eq. (26)) and q = 0.
One–way security proof for CHSHc protocol shows r > 0 =⇒η > 0.924. A variant of CHSHc protocol
that
instead of A0 = {Ma|0}1
a=0 assume A0 = {Ma|0}3
a=0 reduces η∗= 0.909 [240]. Ref. [241] shows an
analogue of Eq.(69) for coherent attacks with memoryless measurement devices.
Generalization 2. If Bob applies the preprocessing T of Eq.(50) ( Sec. 3.5, or Ref. [233, 216])
generating a new raw key T(KB) by flipping each bit independently with probability p before the
post-processing then Eq. (69) becomes [208]

Including the artificial noise to KB damages both the correlation between Alice and Bob and the
correlation to Eve. However, since the possibility of generating a key depends on the difference between
the strengths of these correlations, the net effect is positive. This improvement is already known in the
BB84, where the tolerable QBER increases from 11% (T = id) to 12.4% (T = fp) with a 13% of relative
improvement[242]. In the CHSHc protocol, the critical efficiency lowers from η∗= 0.909 to η∗= 0.832
with an improvement of 78%.
This represents an improvement compared to the efficient post-processing method described in [240].
