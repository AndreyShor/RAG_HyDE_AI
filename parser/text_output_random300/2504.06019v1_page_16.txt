diagnostics with the surface relative humidity, for a fixed set of surface temperatures
and radiative cooling values, and additionally fixed Ra = 106. We plot the diagnostics
against surface relative humidity since the conditional instability diagnostics have a
non-monotonic relationship with RHsurf, but vary monotonically with bsurf, r & Ra.

Conditional instability diagnostics (for the basic state) as a function of the surface relative humidity.
The different line colours represent different values of surface temperature increase, and the different line styles
represent different radiative cooling rates. The Rayleigh number is held fixed at Ra = 106.

Basic state moisture diagnostics (precipitation, P, and the LCL, zs) as a function of the surface
relative humidity. The different line colours represent different values of surface temperature increase, and the
different line styles represent different radiative cooling rates. The Rayleigh number is held fixed at Ra = 106.

if
Ry ∼pCAPE × (1 −LFC)2 × Ra increases, we expect increased levels of (moist
conditional) instability in our system. The Rainy number is shown in the bottom
right panel of Figure 5. In general we see that Ry increases with RHsurf (for
fixed r and bsurf). For varying RHsurf, changes in Ry are dominated by changes in
the LFC rather than changes in pCAPE. The kink in Ry along the black dotted
line (as RHsurf →0) indicates the transition from a moist conditionally unstable
atmosphere (where LFC, CIN > 0), to a (dry) absolutely unstable atmosphere
(bp ≥bE ∀z ∈[0, 1] ⇒LFC, CIN = 0). We find that increasing bsurf (with RHsurf and
