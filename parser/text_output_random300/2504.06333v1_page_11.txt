on both the topological boundary and the topological interface (see Figure 3).

(see Figure 4), which is responsible for the decomposition under gauging trivially
acting symmetries.
There is an alternative route we can take to understand the anomaly resolution
using the SymTFT, which is to introduce additional couplings within the same
SymTFT to engineer trivially acting symmetries in the absolute theory [11]. We
have discussed this in great detail in section 6.3, for the context of group-like
symmetries.
In passing, we point out a minor subtlety.
If the two fusion categories are
Morita-equivalent, their Drinfeld center are isomorphic and will correspond to the
same SymTFT. Therefore, one might attempt to say, e.g., if we can resolve an
anomaly by a larger group G, it is also true that we can resolve it by the fusion
category Rep(G). However, if the resulting theory with G symmetry does not de-
