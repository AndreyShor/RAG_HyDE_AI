Further in this paper, in section 5, we similarly favourably compare the small-∆expan-
sion for r = 2 multi-fractional instanton for N = 3, k = 2 with the “exact” numerical
solution on a detuned T4 with small ∆(2, 2, 1).
We find excellent agreement of the
analytic and numeric fractional instantons for ∆= 0.129 and 0.236.
4. Our study of the multi-fractional instanton contribution to the gaugino condensate uti-
lized the analytic solution for the Q = r/N multi-fractional instanton with k = r via the
∆-expansion [1]. As shown in [1], gauge invariant densities evaluated in the background
of the ∆-expansion solutions are composed of r “lumps.” More precisely, to leading or-
der in the ∆-expansion the gauge invariants are given by a sum of r identical functions
that only differ by their position on the T4, accounting thus for the total number, 4r, of
moduli. Generally, however, these r objects strongly overlap and their gauge invariant
densities do not resemble those expected of a dilute gas; for an illustration, see the plots
for r = 2, N = 3, ∆= 0.129, on Figure 12 below.8
In [27], we determined the shape and volume of the moduli space and showed that
the integral over the r-lump moduli space reproduces the order-r gaugino condensate,
⟨(λλ)r⟩(with gcd(r, N) = 1). This was calculated on R4 in [30], via the—significantly
more complicated, in our view—ADHM construction.
Finally, we can state
The puzzle of [1]: In our studies of multi-fractional instantons (with 1 < r < N), we
encountered a problem with the ∆-expansion around constant-F solutions with gcd(k, r) ̸= r.
We found that the ∆-expansion, already at the leading nontrivial order, leads to new moduli
and a seemingly noncompact moduli space. This is the feature we set out to better understand
here. We shall do this using a combination of analytic and numerical tools.
To describe the resolution, we first turn to the number of constant holonomies S0, which
is 4gcd(k, r). It is well known that a Q = r/N self-dual fractional instanton should have 4r
moduli, as follows from the index theorem [30, 50, 51]. The number of constant holonomies
S0 thus equals 4r only when gcd(r, k) = r, in agreement with the index theorem. Those
with r = k (with r > 1) and r = 1 (any k), are indeed the cases where we found that the
∆-expansion produces a unique9 solution, with moduli determined by the 4gcd(k, r) = 4r
constant holonomies. The integration over the latter determine the condensate ⟨(λλ)r⟩.
8However, if one considers the regime of large-∆, e.g. L1L2 ≫L3L4 (not accessible analytically) resembling
a T2
large×T2
small geometry, one numerically finds r well-separated objects, of size determined by L3L4, localized
in the large L1L2 torus (this geometry was used, e.g., recently in [18]).
9Here, “unique” is meant in the sense that each constant-F solution (for given values of its 4r moduli)
gives rise to a unique non-constant-F solution on the detuned torus, as a series expansion in ∆. We have
not proven that the solutions obtained within the ∆-expansion are the only fractional instantons for the given
values of Lµ. However, the comparison of the numerical multi-fractional instantons with the ones obtained
from the analytic ∆-expansion, see section 5, as well as the correct determination of the higher-order gaugino
condensates [27], provide evidence that these are, indeed, the only saddles.
