γγ+ ≥1j
LH21 status: NNLOQCD corrections known [181] (at leading colour for the two-loop part) as
well as NLOQCD to the loop-induced process [902]; NLOQCD known for γγ + 2j [903–906] and
γγ + 3j [904]; photon isolation effects studied at NLOQCD [907]; NLOQCD corrections for the
EW production of γγ + 2j [908]; NLOEW corrections available for γγj(j) [319];
A new calculation of the production of prompt photons in association with two jets to
NLOQCD matched to parton showers within POWHEG has been presented [909]. In this work,
a comparison with ATLAS data [779] is presented using two parton-shower programs (PYTHIA
and HERWIG). Both variants provide a good description of the data.

γγγ
LH21 status: NNLOQCD corrections in the leading-colour approximation known [180,910].
In Ref. [911], the two-loop QCD corrections to three-photon production beyond the
leading-colour approximation have been obtained. This work constitutes the last missing piece
of the full NNLOQCD calculation with full colour. The authors have estimated that the full-
colour effect in the two-loop virtual corrections will decrease the total cross section by a few
percent with respect to the case with leading-color approximation in the two-loop virtual.

LH21 status:
Fully differential NNLOQCD computed for on-shell top-quark pair produc-
tion [173, 174, 217, 912, 913], also available as fastNLO tables [914]; polarised two-loop ampli-
tudes known [915] ; combination of NNLOQCD and NLOEW corrections performed [916];top
quark decays known at NNLOQCD [175, 259]; Complete set of NNLOQCD corrections to top-
pair production and decay in the NWA for intermediate top quarks and W bosons [917, 918],
including B-hadron production [187]; W +W −b¯b production with full off-shell effects calculated
at NLOQCD [919–922] including leptonic W decays, and in the lepton plus jets channel [923];
full NLOEW corrections for leptonic final state available [924]; calculations with massive bottom
quarks available at NLOQCD [925,926];
b¯b4ℓat NLOQCD matched to a parton shower in the POWHEG framework retaining all off-
shell and non-resonant contributions [927]; NNLOQCD matched to parton shower for on-shell
tops [928, 929]; multi-jet merged predictions for up to 2 jets in SHERPA [930] and HERWIG
7.1 [931]; with NLOEW corrections available [334]; resummation effects up to NNLL com-
puted [932–938]; NNLOQCD + NNLL for (boosted) top-quark pair production [939]. Analytic
results for leading-colour two-loop amplitudes for gg →t¯t known [940].
In Ref. [941], the top-quark decay width has been computed at N3LOQCD. The authors
found that the value of the decay width is decreased by about 0.8%, exceeding the scale variation
at NNLOQCD.
In addition, it was found the the N3LOQCD corrections to the polarisation
fractions are much smaller. In Ref. [942], a new analysis of spin correlation and polarization
effect at the LHC has been conducted at NLOQCD including electroweak effects. Potential new
physics effects parametrized through an effective field theory are also investigated. The authors
of Ref. [943] have reported the first analytical calculation of the two-loop amplitude for the
production of a heavy quark pair via light-quark annihilation. Reference [944] has provided
compact analytical expressions for the production of a pair of top quarks in association with up
