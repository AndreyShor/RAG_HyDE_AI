Their RG evolution of each of the four cases is given in Figure 1.
It should be noted that the breaking of the CG to EG gives a negative contribution to
the cosmological constant and, if this was the only contribution, the space would be AdS.
Thankfully, we have positive contributions from the breakings of SO(18) and SO(12). If
we choose either of these spontaneous breakings to happen at the same scale as the CG
breaking, then the contributions can be fine-tuned to give a zero or slightly positive value for
the cosmological constant in agreement with experimental observations.
We focus on three different scenaria regarding the breakings beyond the GUT scale. In
scenario A the SO(18) group breaks into SO(6)×SO(12) and they in turn break into EG and
SO(10) all at the same scale, MX. As such, the contribution to the cosmological constant
from the breaking of SO(18) cancels the negative one originating from the CG breaking. On
the other hand, in the scenaria B and C, SO(18) breaks into SO(6)× SO(12) at a scale MB,
while both SO(6) and SO(12) will break at another scale, MX, lower than MB but higher
than MGUT. In both B and C it is the contribution to the cosmological constant from the
breaking of SO(12) cancels the negative one. The above are visualised in Figure 2.
