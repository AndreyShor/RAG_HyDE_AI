LIFSHITZ TRANSITIONS IN TWO-LEG LADDER
A.
Two-leg ladder model and plateaux
The incentive model is the Heisenberg spin- 1
2 two-leg ladder in transverse magnetic field
defined by Eq. (A1). The spin ladder (A1) can fermionized and mapped exactly onto an
interacting Hamiltonian of spinless fermions (see Appendix A for discussion on this). The
physics we want to explore is not interaction-driven. It is fully imbedded in the quadratic
effective fermionic Hamiltonian, which can be viewed as a “light” solvable version of (A1):

Here
tα(n) = t[1 + (−1)n+αδ] ,
(3)
hα(n) = µ + (−1)n+αµa .

So we focus on the exactly solvable model of two-leg ladder with the tight-binding Hamil-
tonian (2). Its parameters are: in-chain dimerized hopping tα(n), transverse hopping t⊥,
chemical potential µ, and modulated external potential µa. See Fig. 1.
From the symmetry of Hamiltonians (A1) and (2) it suffices to consider only nonnegative
values (h, µ, ha, µa) ≥0. We shall use the natural units ℏ= kB = 1. In the following all
dimensional quantities will be expressed in units of the energy scale t.
The Jordan-Wigner spin-fermion mapping allows us to establish correspondence between
the induced magnetization per site M and the average number of fermions per site (filling)

FIG. 1. Two-leg ladder with staggered dimerization. Bold/thin/dashed lines represent, respec-
tively, the stronter/weaker in-chain J(1 ± δ) and rung J⊥couplings of the spin Hamiltonian (A1).
For the fermionic Hamiltonian (2) those lines represent corresponding hopping parameters.
For a dimerized chain or staggered two-leg ladder (s = 1/2) in the uniform or staggered
transverse field (P = 2) the theorem (1) predicts occurrence of two plateaux at M = 0 and
1/2, i.e., at ¯n = 1/2, 1, according to [14].
