Relating the analytical to the simulation Parameters
To derive the analytical expression used in the present work (eq. (4) of the main docu-
ment), some approximations had to be made [7], in particular, the envelope of the pulse was
not taken into account. As a result, the dephasing time T ana

fully determines the spectral
width of the second-order susceptibility. However, since the finite pulse length should also
influence the spectral width, we expect the dephasing time used in the simulation T sim
2
to
be slightly larger. Similarly, the perturbation of the second-order susceptibility scales with
the peak intensity of the field and the dipole element dana. For a pulsed excitation, the pro-
portionality factor is smaller, which results in a larger dipole element dsim in the simulation.
To find the corresponding parameters, we run the numerical simulations for T sim
