Accordingly, passing/modulating through a linear polarizer,
the outgoing Stokes vector sout can be transformed by:
  \l
abel  {eq:lp_ph i _p
ol} \mathbf {s}^\text {out}_{\phi _\text {pol}} = \mathbf {M_{\phi _\text {pol}}} \mathbf {s}^\text {out} = \mathbf {R_{\phi _\text {pol}}^T} \mathbf {M_{LP}} \mathbf {R_{\phi _\text {pol}}} \mathbf {s}^\text {out}. 
(5)
Then, the final rendered polarized image is denoted by:
  \m
athb f  
{I}^\
text {out}_{\phi _{\text {pol}}} = \frac {1}{2} \mathbf {s}^\text {out}_{\phi _\text {pol}}[0], 
(6)
where sout
ϕpol[0] is the first element of Stokes vector.
Loss function.
In order to describe the polarization status
in the region of interest (RoI) and reduce the background
noise, we apply a coordinate-based network to predict the
soft mask m(x) of each sampled point x on the camera ray.
Therefore, the complete loss function consists of three com-
ponents with balancing weights denoted as follows:
  \mat h cal { L } = \mathcal {L}_\text {rgb} + \mathcal {L}_\text {mask} + 0.1 \mathcal {L}_\text {eikonal}. \label {eq:loss_fn} 
(7)
The RGB loss Lrgb describes the discrepancies between the
rendered polarized image Iout
ϕpol and the captured image Iϕpol
using ℓ1 loss. The loss is masked with the ground-truth
mask to reduce the noise from surrounding environment.
The predicted mask is supervised by the ground-truth mask
with the binary cross entropy loss Lmask. In addition, we
introduce the eikonal loss Leikonal [10] to regularize the net-
work to learn a valid signed distance field (SDF).
3.3. Theoretical Analysis
Our method aims to retrieve not only geometric and po-
larization information but also the polarizer’s angle from
multi-view images, requiring only one polarization image
per view, which presents us with more unknown variables
to address within a reduced set of limitations.
As aforementioned, we utilize the polarimetric BRDF
model to express the Stokes vector sout as a linear combina-
tion of polarized diffuse and specular counterparts, respec-
tively. Here, we focus solely on the radiance component:
  \l a be l  { eq:rad } \m a thbf {I }^ \te xt {out} = (\mathbf {n}\cdot \mathbf {i}) \left ( f_d(\mathbf {i}, \mathbf {n}, \mathbf {v}) + f_s(\mathbf {i}, \mathbf {n}, \mathbf {v},\eta )\right ) L_i, 
(8)
where i, n, v and η denote the incident lighting direction,
normal, viewing direction, and roughness. Li is incident il-
lumination and is usually defined as white light (Li = 1.0).
The diffuse reflectance fd pertains to light that enters the
subsurface, scatters, and subsequently transmits back in the
direction of observation. The specular reflectance fs mod-
els both specular lobe and spike, which are defined below:
  \ begin {split } f
_d  &= k_d  T (\ mathbf  {v}, \mathbf {n})T(\mathbf {i}, \mathbf {n}), \\ f_s & = k_s W(\mathbf {i}, \mathbf {n}, \mathbf {v}, \eta ) R(\mathbf {h}, \mathbf {v}), \end {split} 
(9)
where W =
DG
4(n·o), and all other parameters are defined in
the same manner as outlined in [1].
The Fresnel coefficients T and R at polarization filter
angle ϕpol are represented by:
  T_{ \ ph i  _
\
t ex
t { po
l
}} = \f r ac {T_p + T_s}{2} \:+\: \rho _t\frac {T_p-T_s}{2}\cos (2\phi _t - 2\phi _\text {pol}), 
(10)
  R_{ \ ph i  _
\
t ex
t { po
l
}} = \f r ac {R_s + R_p}{2} \:+\: \rho _r\frac {R_s-R_p}{2}\cos (2\phi _r - 2\phi _\text {pol}), (11)
where the subscriptions p and s indicate the components
parallel and perpendicular to the reflection plane, while ρt
and ρr represent the degree of linear polarization for trans-
mittance and reflection respectively, ϕt and ϕr correspond
to the angle of polarization of transmission and reflection.
Ultimately, the output estimated radiance Iout (Eq. 8) at
the polarization filter angle ϕpol can be expressed as follows:
  \l
abel  {e q :i _est} \ be gin {spli t}  
\mathb f {I }^\tex t {out}_ {\phi _\text {pol}} = (\mathbf {n}\cdot \mathbf {i}) & \left ( k_d T(\mathbf {v}, \mathbf {n},\phi _\text {pol})T(\mathbf {i}, \mathbf {n}) \: + \right . \\ &~ \left . k_s W(\mathbf {i}, \mathbf {n}, \mathbf {v}, \eta ) R(\mathbf {h}, \mathbf {v}, \phi _\text {pol}) \right ) L_i. \end {split} 
(12)
In our implementation, the incident direction i of the light is
approximated as the reflected direction of v, thereby align-
ing the half vector h with the normal direction. Conse-
quently, the unknown variables in Eq. 12 are limited to n
(2 unknowns, parameterized in spherical coordinates), kd
(3 unknowns), ks (3 unknowns), η (1 unknown), and ϕpol
(1 unknown), totaling 10 unknowns. It is worth noting that,
except for ϕpol, the remaining variables represent intrinsic
material properties of the object and are fully disentangled
within this material model. These variables remain con-
sistent for the same spatial point, irrespective of the view-
ing angle. The view dependency of color provides 3 sepa-
rate constraints (R, G and B) for each view, implying that
only four views are sufficient to render the problem over-
determined, eventually forming 12 independent equations.
Distinction to prior works.
In contrast to the well-
established polarization method, i.e., PANDORA [7], our
method necessitates the acquisition of one single polariza-
tion image at each viewing angle.
We employ the pro-
posed end-to-end rendering framework and enhance ge-
ometric and material reconstruction through optimization
of the rendering loss function. Comparing with conven-
tional non-polarization solutions, such as VolSDF [33], our
