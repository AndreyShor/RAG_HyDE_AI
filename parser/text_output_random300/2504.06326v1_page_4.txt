A selection of eigenvectors from the first and third quadrants in the polar complex
plane in the center vector field in Fig. 1 are given in Table 2.

Definition 6. (Krantz Vector Field Stability Condition [8]).
A vector field ⃗V f in the complex plane is stable, provided all of the eigenvalues of
⃗V f are either within or on the boundary of the unit circle centered 0 in C.

Theorem 1. (Vector Field Stability Condition).
A vector field ⃗V f in the complex plane is stable, provided the maximal eigen-
value of ⃗V f lies within or on the boundary of the unit circle in C.
Proof. From Def. 6, all eigenvalues D = {λ} for a stable vector field lie either
within or on the boundary of the unit circle in C. Hence, max(λ) ∈D lies
either within or on the boundary of the unit circle in C.

vector field in
Fig. 1).
The 5 bigest eigenvalues derived from the center vector field V f in Fig. 1 are given
in Table 3. From Theorem 1, V f is stable, since λmax=-0.7384 in Tabletable:eigval2
lies within the unit circle in the complex plane C.

Definition 7. A characteristic of an object (aka sets, systems) X is a mapping φ:
φ : X →C defined by φ(x ∈X) ∈C.
Definition 8. (Characteristic Distance).
Let X, Y be nonempty sets and a ∈A ∈2X, b ∈B ∈2Y and let φ(a), φ(b) be
numerical characteristics inherent in A and B. The nearness mapping dΦ : 2X ×
2Y →R is defined by
dΦ(A, B) = inf
a∈A
b∈B
|φ(a) −φ(b)| = ε ∈[0, 1] ∈C.
In effect, A, B are characteristically near, provided 0 ≤dΦ(A, B) ≤1 in the first
quadrant of the unit circle in the complex plane C.
