In this Supplemental Material we provide supporting information and data.
• In Section S.I, we discuss some basic properties of non-Hermitian (NH) systems.
• In Section S.II, we provide the complete derivation of the iterative construction of the Hamiltonian used in the
non-Hermitian numerical renormalization group (NH-NRG) method.
• In Section S.III, we illustrate alternative truncation schemes for the NH-NRG procedure.
• In Section S.IV, we provide additional eigenvalue flow diagrams for the NH Anderson Impurity Model (AIM).
• In Section S.V, we discuss the evolution of the Kondo temperature TK.

NON-HERMITIAN SYSTEMS
Before jumping into the iterative construction procedure used in NH-NRG, we first provide a brief discussion of
NH matrices which will come in useful later. See also Refs. [1, 2] for discussions of bi-orthogonal quantum mechanics.
For an NH system, for which ˆH ̸= ˆH†, the left and right eigenvectors are defined such that,
ˆH |Ej⟩R = λj |Ej⟩R
,
ˆH† |Ej⟩L = λ∗
j |Ej⟩L
(S.1)
⟨Ej|R ˆH† = ⟨Ej|R λ∗
j
,
⟨Ej|L ˆH = ⟨Ej|L λj.
(S.2)
Although the left and right eigenvectors are not individually orthonormal, they may form a bi-orthogonal basis if the
eigenspectrum is non-degenerate. In the following we assume this property, which can be defined as,
⟨Ei|Ej⟩LR = δij .
(S.3)
Here we have also bi-normalized the basis. We note that a bi-orthonormal basis is not the default output for left
and right eigenvectors from most standard numerical eigensolvers (e.g. via Python, Julia, or Fortran) and so the
bi-normalization typically has to be done manually.
To bi-normalize the left and right eigenvectors, we first compute the overlaps,
LRj = ⟨Ej|Ej⟩LR ,
(S.4)
and then, provided the corresponding left and right eigenvectors are non-orthogonal, we rescale the vectors,
|Ej⟩R →|Ej⟩R
p
LRj
,
|Ej⟩L →|Ej⟩L
p
LRj
∗,
(S.5)
which ensures ⟨Ej|Ej⟩LR = 1.
Assuming bi-orthonormality now, an NH matrix ˆH can be decomposed in terms of its left and right eigenvectors,
ˆH
=
X
j
λj|Ej⟩⟨Ej|RL
,
⟨Ej|L ˆH |Ek⟩R = δjkλj .
(S.6)
With some bi-normalized basis |ϕj⟩L(R) of left(right) states, we can construct the Hamiltonian matrix Hϕ with
elements [Hϕ]ij = ⟨ϕi|L ˆH |ϕj⟩R. Numerical diagonalization of this matrix yields UR HE (UL)† = Hϕ where [HE]ij =
δijλj and the columns of the matrices UR and UL contain the right and left eigenvectors. It follows that,
(UL)†UR = I
