where qi(ξ) is a functional distribution describing the probability to extract a parton q of flavor i
from the colliding hadron. The sum runs over all possible flavors, and we have to integrate over
all possible momentum fractions and probability configurations. Effectively, energy-momentum
conservation implies that the integration bounds in Eq. (1.38) are limited by x and 1. Note that
the object qi(ξ) contains a spin index, which is here omitted, but follows automatically once the
PDF is defined in terms of field operators [42, 43]. As before we can decompose the partonic
tensors according to Eq. (1.27)

The major difference is that now the partonic structure functions ˆFi, ˆgi are computable directly
from the Feynman diagrams associated to the partonic scattering, multiplied by a suitable
projector (see Ref. [26] for a complete list).
At LO, only diagrams with quarks in the initial state can contribute and, the computation of
Eq. (1.39) reduces to the diagram q(pq) + V ∗(q) →q′(p′
q). For example, in the case of photon
exchange only, after averaging over the spin, its amplitude leads to the integral

By comparing to Eq. (1.27) we can identify the 2 non-vanishing partonic structure functions, F1
and F2, which are proportional to Dirac-delta. More in general, after applying the projectors,
summing or subtracting on the parton spin and performing the convolution with the PDF, one
finds the relations between hadronic structure function and PDFs. For the NC, we get:
