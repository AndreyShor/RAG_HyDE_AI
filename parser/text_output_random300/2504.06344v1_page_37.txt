Âµ and Ï•2
Âµ, respectively. Four linear combinations of the eight moduli correspond to transla-
tions of the center-of-mass of the two-lump solution, while the other four can be pictorially
described as a relative separation between the lumps (the global structure of the Ï•Câ€²
Âµ moduli
space was elucidated in detail in [27]).
To facilitate comparison to the lattice data, we integrate (5.1) over x2 and x4. This
eliminates the oscillating exponents in (5.1) and renders the integral independent of the
moduli Ï•Câ€²

and Ï•Câ€²

with respect to the four fitting parameters, Â¯xCâ€²
1
and Â¯xCâ€²
3 , for Câ€² = 1, 2. Only the first few
values of m and n in equation (5.2) are considered, as contributions from higher values are
exponentially suppressed. Additionally, the improved action described in (C.8) of Appendix
C is employed to eliminate next-to-leading-order corrections. The data is fitted using the
standard least squares method, minimizing the squared difference between theory and data
across all x1-x3 plane points.
We show results for two different values of âˆ†. The result for âˆ†(2, 2, 1) = 0.236, on a
(32, 4, 12, 12) lattice is shown on Figure 11. A different fit, this time for a smaller âˆ†(2, 2, 1) =
0.129 on a lattice (20, 12, 8, 32) is shown on Figure 12. The fits provide a remarkable agreement
between the lattice data and the leading-order âˆ†-expansion analytic result of [1].
