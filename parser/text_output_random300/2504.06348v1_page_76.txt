The state |Φel⟩is a uniform state prepared with USP. However, we must include the cost of the control
on the term selection register. The cost of a controlled USP is 7⌈log(ηval)⌉+ 2bηval −6 and uses ⌈log(ηval)⌉
additional ancillae. For the non-local term, we must also prepare |Φel⟩controlled on the term selection
register. However, this cost can be shared; we encode the local and non-local terms in the term selection
register with the bases |0100⟩and |1000⟩, respectively, and so if we wish to prepare |Φel⟩conditioned on
either of these terms, we only need to CNOT the high bit conditioned on the second-highest bit to flip to
|1100⟩and |1000⟩, and then prepare |Φel⟩once conditioned on the high bit (and then undo the CNOT).
We have the state

However, the coefficient λ ˜V I
loc only depends on ion I insofar as it depends on the ionic species ζI. Instead of
preparing |Φion⟩directly, we first prepare a state

where mζ is the multiplicity of the ion species ζ. We then use a QROM over ζ to load mζ, use USP to
prepare a uniform superposition over mζ amplitudes, and then uncompute the QROM:

which is |Φion⟩up to entanglement with junk in the |ζ⟩register (that we can ignore given that this is a state
preparation routine inside a block encoding).
The cost of preparing a state |Φζ⟩just using arbitrary state preparation to bZ bits of precision using
routines like [103] is 4Z + ⌈log Z⌉(bZ −3) −2 [63]. The QROM to load mζ has cost Z (and we assume
the same cost for its uncomputation). Adding a control (for the term selection register) to each of these
subroutines only requires a small constant number of Toffolis, which we omit. The controlled USP has cost
at most 7⌈log(ηion)⌉+ 2bI −4 (i.e. in the case where all the ions are the same species). The total cost,
therefore, is 6Z + ⌈log Z⌉(bZ −3) + 7⌈log(ηion)⌉+ 2bI −6. We require bZ ancillas for the arbitrary state prep
and max{bI, ⌈log(ηion)⌉} for the USP.
As for the non-local term, the QROM to load mζ and the USP is shared with the local term, and we can
therefore compute those steps once (using the trick above). The only retained cost is that for the preparation
of |Φζ⟩(where now we are loading analogous coefficients that are constructed from V PI
NL rather than V PI
loc).
