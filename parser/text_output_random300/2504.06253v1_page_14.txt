non-QUBO-Relaxed optimization in general has no performance guarantees, we expect that for larger problems,
more iterations would be needed.
The relative performance of QAOA between GW2 warmstarts and QUBO-Relaxed is problem and metric dependent.
Future researchers might be interested in better understanding the mechanisms behind these differences.
