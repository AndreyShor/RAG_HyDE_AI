Figure 1. Action density of the |Q| = 1/3 self-dual solution with r = k = 1. On the four plots,
we show the action density, in each case integrated over all but one T4 coordinate. The lattice size
is L1, L2, L3, L4 = 18, 4, 6, 6, corresponding to a tuned T4 with ∆(1, 1, 2) = 0. Thus, multiplying the
integrated action density by the appropriate Lµ in each case yields 8π2 × 1
3 ≃26.3 (this number can be
verified simply by a look at the above plot). We generate 104 minimum-action configurations starting
from random initial conditions. We display the action density of all the 104 configurations plotted on
top of each other. The action densities of all these configurations coincide within numerical error.

Numerical study of the moduli space for gcd(k, r) = r
The fractional instantons can be also constructed on the lattice, by minimizing the lattice
action with appropriate twists n12 and n34, by inserting two intersecting center vortices in
the lattice action (thus twisting the boundary conditions on the lattice). Here, we generalize
the recent SU(2) study of [38] to the case of SU(3). The lattice setup and the methods used
are described in Appendix C.
In this section, we present our results for the lattice minimum action configurations
with both Q = −1
3 and Q =
2
3 for the tuned T4.18
Thus, we take 2L3L4 = L1L2 for
Q = −1
3, such that ∆(1, 1, 2) = 0, by (1.3). Likewise, we take L3L4 = L1L2 for Q = 2
3,
such that ∆(2, 2, 1) = 0. In both cases, we find that, starting the cooling algorithm from
18To avoid confusion, we note that our SU(3) lattice simulations use the twists n12 = 1 and n34 = 1,
corresponding to topological charge Q = −1
3 (mod 1). Thus the minimum action lattice configurations have
topological charges either −1/3 or 2/3; see Appendix C.
