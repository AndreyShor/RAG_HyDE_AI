Another challenge is how to handle phase discontinuities. As phase values have a periodic nature, it 
produces artificial discontinuities at 0/2𝜋 boundary that do not correspond to physical reality. 
Machine learning models treat these points as distant values rather than the same physical states, and 
thus create artificial errors compromising prediction accuracy. A regression model without physics 
knowledge thus struggles to handle this periodic nature of phase, often penalizing the model with 
large errors near the boundaries.  
We formulate this problem as a physics-constrained regression task that predicts the amplitude and 
phase of transmitted light from metasurface using the structural parameters. Our neural network 
model handles both gap regimes and respects the circular nature of phase values. The model 
maintains physical consistency, particularly energy conservation principle constraining amplitude 
values, and the mathematical constraint that enforces that the sine and cosine components of any 
valid phase angle 𝜑 satisfy 𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝜑+ 𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝜑= 1. 
2.2 Overall Architecture  
As shown in Figure II, our neural network accepts input parameters that represent the material and 
geometric properties of the metasurface unit cell. It follows a structure with multiple dense layers, 
starting with a wide layer of 256 neurons that gradually decreases in width (layers of 128, and 64 
neurons) to extract relevant features. The network is then divided into two specialized output paths: 
amplitude branch, and phase branch. Before these branches, we included dense layers of 32 neurons 
serving as feature extractors for each output. Batch normalization followed by ReLU activation are 
applied to all dense layers to ensure fair contribution of all features throughout the network’s layers 
and non-linear capabilities. It is worth mentioning that we employed dropout layers (rate= 0.1) after 
the first two layers to avoid overfitting during training process. 
We used different activation functions for the branches based on their underlying physics: 
1- Amplitude branch uses a sigmoid activation function constraining outputs to the physically 
meaningful range of [0 , 1]. 
2- Phase branch uses a tanh (hyperbolic tangent) activation function constraining outputs to [-1 , 1] 
that enable one to handle phase wrapping using sine and cosine components.
