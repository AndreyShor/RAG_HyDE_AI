engineering fields and integrating new technologies. This 
work offers new perspectives for improving the 
efficiency of gas pipeline systems and lays the 
groundwork for future investigations. 
The proposed technological model provides a 
comprehensive solution for managing complex gas 
transportation systems. Future work should focus on 
further improving the model by integrating additional 
predictive technologies and enhancing data transmission 
methods. Furthermore, continuous advancements in 
control systems and emergency response strategies are 
necessary to address the increasing complexity of global 
gas transportation networks.
