Introduction
The AdS/CFT correspondence is a profound duality that relates a gravitational theory in anti-de
Sitter (AdS) spacetime to a conformal field theory (CFT) defined on its boundary. Within this
framework, the degrees of freedom of the boundary CFT encode the dynamics of the bulk gravi-
tational theory, providing a novel approach to studying strongly coupled quantum systems. This
correspondence has had significant implications across various fields, including quantum chromo-
dynamics, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity [1, 2].
One of the most striking features of AdS/CFT is its ability to translate complex problems
in field theory into more tractable geometric problems in the bulk. A key example is the Ryu—
Takayanagi [3] and Hubeny—Rangamani-–Takayanagi [4] proposals, which establish a connection
between boundary entanglement entropy and extremal surfaces in the bulk. These proposals suggest
that the entanglement structure of the boundary state plays a fundamental role in the emergence
of bulk geometry. However, understanding how this boundary entanglement data reconstructs the
full bulk spacetime remains an open problem in general.
Traditionally, holographic models of field theory phenomena begin with a well-defined super-
gravity action that exhibits clear symmetries. However, the reverse problem known as bulk re-
construction is equally intriguing and significantly more challenging. It involves reconstructing the
dual holographic spacetime, along with any dynamic matter fields, from boundary field theory data.
This process raises fundamental questions about how the boundary is represented within the bulk
geometry. While various methods for bulk reconstruction have been proposed [5–18], most rely on
precise knowledge of boundary quantities. In realistic scenarios, however, handling imprecise and
discrete boundary data is crucial [19, 20].
Despite substantial progress, the question of how gravitational degrees of freedom emerge from
a non-gravitational boundary theory remains one of the deepest mysteries in holography. Resolving
this issue continues to drive research at the intersection of quantum field theory, gravity, and
information theory.
In this work, we take a step toward addressing this challenge by seeking guidance from mathe-
matics. Rather than assuming a specific bulk theory from the outset, we explore what mathematical
structures can reveal about the possible ways in which a bulk spacetime could emerge from bound-
ary data. While a complete classification of holographic spacetimes is beyond the scope of our
study, our research premise is to aim to identify key mathematical principles that govern the recon-
struction process. By doing so, we hope to gain insights into how boundary information constrains
the possible geometric structures in the bulk and what this implies for the nature of holographic
dualities. For instance, in gapped field theories, reconstructions using slab-shaped entangling re-
gions fail because entanglement entropy saturates due to the finite correlation length [21–23]. This
is because of homogeneous boundary data; it would be interesting to attempt bulk reconstruction
with more generic planar deformations [24]. In contrast, ball-shaped entangling regions can probe
the full bulk geometry, making them more suitable stepping stones for reconstruction. We see this
work as a first step, laying the groundwork for future investigations that may eventually lead to a
deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of holography through entanglement.
We emphasize that key foundational questions remain unresolved. For example, AdS space-
time can clearly be foliated by maximally symmetric minimal surfaces, hemispheres of varying radii,
hanging from the asymptotic boundary. Yet, it remains an open question whether a spacetime M
with the same minimal surface areas as for AdS must necessarily be identified with AdS itself.
From a mathematical perspective, the difficulty of the bulk reconstruction problem is not surpris-
ing. The problem is related to inverse boundary value problems for partial differential equations
(PDE), a field of mathematics with many long-standing open questions. The inverse problem most
closely related to this work is the anisotropic Calder´on problem on Riemannian manifolds, which
