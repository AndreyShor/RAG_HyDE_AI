This conﬁguration eﬀectively represents two non-commutative membranes that
do not interact, as the matrices are block-diagonal with identical elements.
To introduce interactions between the membranes, one can add oﬀ-diagonal
elements to the matrices8. For example:
X1 =
 x1
φ
φ
x1

.
(5.13)
Here, φ represents the interaction between the two membranes. This approach
is analogous to how interactions are modeled in other matrix models, where oﬀ-
diagonal elements mediate the dynamics between diﬀerent branes or extended
objects.
By tuning the oﬀ-diagonal terms, one can control the strength and nature
of the interaction, allowing for the modeling of phenomena such as brane col-
lisions, bound states, or dynamic exchanges of energy and momentum between
membranes.

4, 6, 8, 10-Dimensional Non-Commutative Membranes
A 4-dimensional non-commutative membrane can be constructed using the fol-
lowing conﬁguration:
X0 = σ3,
(5.14)
X1 = x1,
(5.15)
X2 = x2,
(5.16)
X3 = x1,
(5.17)
X4 = x2,
(5.18)
X5,...,10 = 0,
(5.19)
with the non-commutative relation:
[x1, x2] = iθ.
(5.20)
This setup eﬀectively “duplicates” the non-commutative plane across additional
dimensions, resulting in a 4-dimensional non-commutative membrane.
The
method can be extended similarly to create 6, 8, and 10-dimensional non-
commutative membranes by introducing more such pairs of spatial coordinates
while maintaining the same non-commutative relation between each pair.
8For the method of introducing interactions into diagonal terms, see for example [23].
