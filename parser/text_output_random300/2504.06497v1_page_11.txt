positives by the sum of true positives and false negatives. The F1 score, a harmonic mean of
precision and recall, balances the trade-off between these two metrics. Additionally, the Area
Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC AUC) assesses the model’s ability to
discriminate between positive and negative instances across different probability thresholds. A
higher ROC AUC signifies superior model performance, particularly useful when evaluating the
discriminatory power of the model.The Cohen’s Kappa coefficient is a statistic that measures
the level of agreement between two raters beyond that which would be expected by chance[44].
The table 1 below shows the performance of classical data and quantum data embedding with
an 80:20 train-test split ratio.
The experimental results indicate that different data encoding techniques, including Classical,
IQP, Displacement, and Squeezing, exhibit varying levels of performance across multiple clas-
sifiers and PCA dimensions. The accuracy of Logistic Regression improves as the number of
PCA components increases, reaching a peak of 79.01% for PCA=23. Similarly, k-NN and SVM
(Linear and Polynomial) show an increasing trend in performance with higher PCA components.
IQP encoding maintains an accuracy of 49.33% across all models and PCA settings. This suggests
that the method either does not effectively capture the necessary data structure or introduces
excessive noise that affects classification performance. In contrast, Displacement and Squeezing
encodings, which fall under continuous-variable quantum encoding, demonstrate relatively bet-
ter performance. Logistic Regression with Squeezing achieves a maximum accuracy of 73.26%
for PCA=23, showing an improvement over IQP. Similarly, k-NN with Displacement encoding
attains an accuracy of 71.12% for PCA=23. A similar trend is observed in SVM models, where
Displacement and Squeezing encodings show marginal improvements with increasing PCA com-
ponents.
The impact of PCA components is evident, as increasing PCA dimensions enhances classifi-
cation performance for all encoding techniques. PCA=23 consistently provides the best results,
demonstrating the importance of feature dimensionality reduction in improving predictive accu-
racy. Despite these improvements, quantum encodings tend to have significantly higher running
times. The computational cost is particularly high in models such as SVM with Displacement
encoding, especially when using PCA=23. In contrast, Logistic Regression with IQP encoding
exhibits low running times but does not deliver comparable accuracy, indicating that the method
may require further optimization.
The results suggest that different encoding strategies influence classification outcomes in dis-
tinct ways. While some quantum encodings show improvements with increasing PCA compo-
nents, computational efficiency remains a key consideration. Further exploration is required to
optimize these techniques for enhanced predictive performance and practical feasibility.
