where confirmation is still to happen. Blue lines relate to states showing properties in line with the quark model (using the results of
Ref. [108] as a guidance), red lines those with unconventional properties. To distinguish isovector states a + is attached to the name.
Thin dashed lines indicate the thresholds for the particle pairs put on the left (charge conjugation is understood to be included). The
thick, solid lines show the lowest thresholds, where two narrow open charm states can combine to the given quantum numbers.
hadronic molecules the spin doublets {D, D∗}, with negative parity and negligible widths, and {D1(2420), D2(2460)} with positive parity and
widths below 50 MeV. All 4 states fill a flavor [¯3] multiplet. In contrast to the listed narrow states, the doublet {D0(2300), D1(2430)} having
widths of the order of 300 MeV, is not expected to form hadronic molecules.
Since the centrifugal barrier acts like a repulsive force, in general hadronic molecules should typically appear in S -waves. Accordingly,
the quantum numbers of the constituents dictate those of the composite state. In Fig. 7 both is shown the thresholds for the various hidden
charm channels (as the thin dashed lines) as well as the lowest threshold where the given quantum numbers can be reached in an S -wave
by combining the quantum numbers of the constituents [15]. It is interesting to observe that with one exception—the Tc¯c0(4240)+, that still
awaits confirmation—all states with unconventional properties observed so far appear either just below or above the thick black line, as
expected for hadronic molecules. Moreover, from these considerations it follows that, if the Y(4230) is a D1 ¯D molecular state [104, 111,
112], its lightest spin partner state with JP = 0−must be located near the D1 ¯D∗threshold and thus be 140 MeV heavier than the Y(4230).
This prediction was confirmed in a microscopic calculation [113] that even puts a state with the exotic quantum numbers6 JPC = 0−−in this
mass range. The very same calculation also identifies ψ(4230), ψ(4360), and ψ(4415) as hadronic molecules with JPC = 1−−and binding
energies between about 50 and 70 MeV in the channels D1 ¯D, D1 ¯D∗and D2 ¯D∗, respectively.
A state that does not fit into the classification as S -wave hadronic molecules is the Zc(4430), since it sits in the mass range of the
D∗¯D2 threshold, but has positive parity. A possible explanation for a two-hadron structure of it could be a P-wave D∗¯D1 state [114]. This
explanation calls for assigning the Y(4390) as its S -wave companion. If this explanation were correct, there should be a signature of the
Zc(4430) in the D∗D∗π subsystem of e.g. B →KD∗D∗π (so far the Zc(4430) showed up only in B →KZc(4430)). While the model study
of Ref. [115] does not confirm the mentioned assignment, it finds a series of isoscalar P-wave states. In Ref. [116] another meson exchange
