eiaAÂµ(n), where lattice points are labeled by integer coordinates nÂµ = {1, ..., LÂµ}. The pla-
quettes summed over in the lattice action emanate from all lattice points with coordinates
nÎ» = {1, ..., LÎ»} in all positive directions in all Âµ-Î½ planes. We denote by ËœUÂµÎ½(n) the plaquette

(C.1)
To define a plaquette whose origin is at the edge of the lattice, i.e. has any coordinate with
nÂµ = LÂµ, we need to impose boundary conditions on the link variables, relating their values
at nÂµ = LÂµ + 1 to those at nÂµ = 1. Instead of the usual periodic boundary conditions, we
subject the link variables to the twisted boundary conditions, relating their values at nÂµ = 1
and nÂµ = LÂµ + 1, as in the continuum eqn. (2.1),
ËœUÂµ (n + LÎ½ Ë†Î½) = â„¦Î½ (n) ËœUÂµ (n) â„¦â€ 
Î½ (n + Ë†Âµ) ,
(C.2)
where the transition functions â„¦Î½ obey (2.2) (recalling that â„¦Î½ is independent on nÎ½).33 How-
ever, when written using the independent ËœUÂµ variables, after imposing (C.2), the plaquette
action acquires explicit dependence on the transition functions34 and the measure has to
include integration over these with the right cocycle condition. One can, however, make a
change of variables:
ËœUÂµ(n) =
(
UÂµ(n)
nÂµ Ì¸= LÂµ

nÂµ = LÂµ

(C.3)
A careful application of (C.2) to the lattice action (given by the first term in (C.4) below),
followed by (C.3), shows that when expressed in terms of UÂµ, the Wilson action does not have
an explicit dependence on â„¦Âµ and is, instead, given by the second term below

(C.4)
Here, the plaquette UÂµÎ½(n) is defined in the same way as (C.1), with the boundary plaquettes
evaluated using UÂµ(n + LÎ½ Ë†Î½) = UÂµ(n) instead of (C.2). Most importantly, the dependence on
the twist (2.2) is encoded in BÂµÎ½(n), the center symmetry ZN-background,

(C.5)
As made clear from (C.4), a phase eâˆ’2Ï€inÂµÎ½/N is now included in the action, at the point
(nÂµ, nÎ½) = (LÂµ, LÎ½) in the Âµ-Î½ plane, for all values of the other nÎ», Î» Ì¸= Âµ, Î½ coordinates. With
the path integral over periodic UÂµ(n), the modern interpretation [65] of the â€™t Hooft twist as
33Formally, the definition (C.2) defines fields over an infinite cover of the finite lattice, but we shall only
need the subset of link variables obeying (C.2) that enter the lattice action (C.4).
34As is easiest to verify in e.g. a single-plaquette two-dimensional world with L1 = L2 = 1.
