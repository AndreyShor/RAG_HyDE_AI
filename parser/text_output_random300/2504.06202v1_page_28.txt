We then recall the following interior arm event defined in [42]. Let η be a chordal SLEκ in
H from 0 to ∞. Fix z ∈H, r > 0 and y ≤−4r. Let τ1 be the first time that η hits Bε(z).
Let E2(ε, z) := {τ1 < ∞}. Let σ1 be the first time after τ1 that η hits the connected component
containing y −r of ∂Br(y) \ η[0, τ1]. Let E be the event that z is in the unbounded connected
component of H\(η([0, σ1])∪Br(y)). On E, let Cz be the connected component of Bε(z)\η([0, σ1])
that contains z. Let Cb
z be the unique connected component of ∂Cz∩∂Bε(z) which can be connected
to ∞in H \ (η([0, σ1]) ∪Bε(z)). Let xz be the ending point of Cb
z if we orient it in the clockwise
direction.
For j ≥2, let τj be the first time after σj−1 that η hits the connected component
of Cb
z \ η([0, σj−1]) containing xz, and let σj be the first time after τj that η hits the connected
component of ∂Br(y) \ η([0, τj]) containing y −r. For j ≥2, define
E2j(ε, z, y, r) = E ∩{τj < ∞}.
(6.7)
Note that the definitions of E2j(ε, z, y, r) is restrictive on the arcs that each crossing first hits. For
instance, the events depicted in Figure 1.4 do not belong to this type of arm events. In the following
Proposition 6.2, there is also some non-explicit constant R, as well as an event F, which add to the
constraints on the 2j-arm events considered there.
Let us cite the following proposition from [42].
Proposition 6.2 (Proposition 4.1, [42]). Fix κ ∈(0, 4].4 Fix z ∈H with |z| = 1. Define F =
{η[0, τ1] ⊂BR}. There exists R > 0 which only depends on κ and z, such that for j ≥1 and r, y
with R ≤r ≤(40)2jr ≤|y| ≲r, we have
P[E2j(ε, z, y, r) ∩F] = εξ2j+o(1).
(6.8)
More precisely, in order to establish (6.8), [42, Proposition 4.1] has proved
P[E2j(ε, z, y, r) ∩F] ≳εξ2j,
(6.9)
P[E2j(ε, z, y, r) ∩F] ≤εξ2j+o(1),
(6.10)
where the implicit constant in (6.9) can depend on κ, j, y, r, z.
Remark 6.3. In this remark, we point out the aforementioned gap in the proof of the upper bound
(6.10) in [42, Proposition 4.1] (similar gaps also exist in the proofs of the three upper bounds in
[43, Proposition 3], for SLEκ with κ ∈(4, 8)).
The proof of the upper bound in [42, Proposition 4.1] relies crucially on an induction step,
which estimates the probability of E2j(ε, z, y, r)∩F using the upper bound (6.4) on P

obtained in Proposition 6.1, see [42, (4.2)]. Let us follow the notations of [42, Lemma 4.3]. For
t > 0, let Θt := arg(gt(z) −Wt). Let C ≥16 be a fixed constant. Let ξ be the first time that η hits
∂BCε(z). For δ ∈(0, 1/16), let
eF = {ξ < ∞, Θξ ∈(δ, π −δ), η[0, ξ] ⊂BR}.
Let f := gξ −Wξ. The proof of [42, Lemma 4.3] first establishes that conditionally on η[0, ξ], eF,
4The statement in [42, Proposition 4.1] was made only for κ ∈(0, 4), but we believe that the same argument also
works for κ = 4.
