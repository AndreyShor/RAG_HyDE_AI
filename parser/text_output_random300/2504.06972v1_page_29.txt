Extended Data Fig. 8 | dV/dI-Idc curves for the superconducting state. a, Differential 
resistance dV/dI as a function of dc current Idc measured at T = 100 mK, νh = 0.735, and D = 0, 
under varying B from 0 T to 0.6 T in 0.1 T step. The ac modulation current is 1 nA. b-d, dV/dI 
as a function of Idc measured with the same νh and D as in a, at TMC = 15 mK and B = 0.1 T (b), 
B = 0.3 T (c), and B = 0.5 T (d), respectively. Black (red) lines represent scans of Idc from 
negative (positive) values to positive (negative) values. The ac modulation current is 0.3 nA. 
Hysteresis in Idc has been observed at small B, possibly related to the current switching of 
domain walls.
