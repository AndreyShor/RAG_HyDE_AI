impurity phases such as Hf2Fe and Zr2Fe may serve as alternative sources of point
pinning.
Some wire samples exhibit Jc exceeding 105 A/cm2 at lower magnetic ﬁelds; how-
ever, further eﬀorts are necessary to enhance Jc, particularly at higher ﬁelds. While
the sintering method is currently the sole approach employed for wire fabrication,
exploring alternative fabrication techniques is highly desirable. For instance, draw-
ing a rod-shaped sample obtained via arc melting represents a promising alternative
method.

Nb2/5Hf1/5Zr1/5Ti1/5, synthesized using arc-melting and spark plasma sintering
(SPS) techniques[76]. The superconducting transition temperatures were 7.99 K for
the arc-melted sample and 6.63 K for the SPS sample. The upper critical ﬁelds were
14.63 T and 11.68 T for the arc-melted and SPS samples, respectively, corresponding
to ξGL(0) of 4.84 nm and 5.41 nm.
The magnetic hysteresis loops of the arc-melted sample exhibit narrow and asym-
metric proﬁles (see Fig. 12(a)). The asymmetry in the M-H loops has been attributed
to the surface barrier eﬀect[77]. Conversely, the SPS sample displays symmetric,
diamond-shaped hysteresis loops, indicating strong ﬂux pinning. Flux jumps are
observed at low temperatures and low magnetic ﬁelds in the SPS sample (see Fig.
12(b)). Furthermore, at higher magnetic ﬁelds, the M-H loops of the SPS sample
show an unusual secondary peak, known as the ﬁshtail eﬀect, suggesting the presence
of ﬂux pinning sites that become eﬀective at elevated magnetic ﬁelds (see the inset
of Fig. 12(b)). Figures 13(a) and (b) present the Jc datasets for the arc-melted and
SPS samples. Notably, the self-ﬁeld Jc at 2 K for the SPS sample (39,000 A/cm2) is
signiﬁcantly higher than that of the arc-melted sample (5,500 A/cm2). Moreover, the
