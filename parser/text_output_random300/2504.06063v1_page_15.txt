under control the cutoff effects on our physical observ-
ables.
Indeed, the decay rate and the lepton-energy
moments are on-shell quantities that probe the QCD
spectrum for energies smaller than mDs. Therefore, in
principle, to keep under control cutoff effects, given our
O(a)-improved lattice setup, it would be enough to have
(amDs)2 ≪1 on the finer simulated lattices and, in fact,
this condition is satisfied in our case (see Table I). On
the other hand, given our representations of the decay
rate and of the lepton-energy moments (see Eqs. (33)
and (41)), it is important to avoid large errors in the
approximation of the smearing kernels Θ(p)
σ (ωmax −ω0)
for ω0 ≫1/(amDs) that could enhance the cutoff effects
by interfering with the distortions of the lattice spectral
densities Z(p)(ω0, ω2; a) at energies of the order of the
lattice cutoff. Actually, in our approach (see Ref. [6] for
a different possibility) the limits

have to be taken by first performing the λ 7→0 and
N 7→∞limits, that can safely be interchanged and that
we perform jointly with the so-called stability analysis
procedure (see below), and then by performing the con-
tinuum extrapolation. Notice that the dependence upon
the parameter α disappears after performing the N 7→∞
limit because, according to the Stone-Weierstrass theo-
rem, the systematic error associated with the imperfect
reconstruction of the smearing kernel at finite N can be
made arbitrarily small by increasing N for any definition
of the L2-norm and therefore, in our language, for any
definition of the functional A(p)
α [g]. Unfortunately, this
is not the case for the statistical error

Within the HLT algorithm statistical errors are tamed
by implementing the regularization mechanism originally
proposed by Backus and Gilbert in Ref. [39].
This is
done by introducing the so-called trade-off parameter λ
and by adding the term proportional to the error func-
tional in Eq. (80). There are two facts that have to be
considered in order to understand the rˆole of the trade-
off parameter within the HLT algorithm.
The first is
that the Backus-Gilbert regularization is statistically un-
biased: in the idealized situation in which the correla-
tors ˆZ(p)(an, ω2; a) have no errors the functional B(p)[g]

Stability analysis for the contribution p = 0 to the

description and interpretation of the figure. Top panel: study

is identically zero and, therefore, the same result is ob-
tained for any value of λ. The second fact is that, for
small values of the smearing parameter σ, the coefficients
obtained by solving Eq. (83) with increasingly smaller
values of λ tend to become huge in magnitude and os-
cillating in sign [9]. Consequently, by using these coeffi-
cients in Eq. (87), the statistical errors on the differential
decay rate tend to be unacceptably large and, moreover,
the estimates of the central values cannot be trusted in
this regime because even tiny rounding errors on the lat-
tice correlators ˆZ(p)(an, ω2; a) get enormously enhanced.
The stability analysis, introduced in Ref. [40] (see also
Refs. [17–19, 41]), is a procedure that allows to perform
the λ 7→0 and N 7→∞limits appearing in Eq. (86) by
leveraging on these two facts.
An example of stability analysis is shown in Figure 8.
