SI-Fig. 12: Relaxation time: a) Relaxation time, tR, is defined as the time taken by the Rxx (and TRox)
to reach the steady state value from the value of Rxx at Bstop. Extracting tR for near MATBG at B||stop =
−17.5 mT (top panel) and −35 mT (bottom panel). b) tR vs. Bstop for measured TBG and calibrated Rox

Hysteresis at finite displacement fields
SI- 8
: Controlling n and D
We have a dual-gated near magic-angle device where we have tuned the electrostatic doping and the applied
perpendicular displacement field for our measurements. The metallic layer deposited on top of the top hBN
and the SiO2/Si act as the top gate and the global back gate, respectively. By applying top gate (Vtg) and
back gate (Vbg) voltages on the device we can control the number density, n, and the vertical displacement
field, D 6–10.
Controlling n:
n = Cbg(Vbg −Vbg,0) + Ctg(Vtg −Vtg,0)

Controlling D:
D = Cbg(Vbg −Vbg,0) −Ctg(Vtg −Vtg,0)

Here Cbg, Ctg, Vbg,0, Vbg,0, e and ϵ0 are respectively the back gate capacitance per area, top gate capacitance
per area, bottom gate Dirac point offset, top gate Dirac point offset, bare electronic charge, and free space
