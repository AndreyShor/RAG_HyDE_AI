Figure 2. An example of identification of precursor, quiescent period and extended emission of GRB 170228A
based on the criterion. The upper panel is the light curve of GRB, and bottom panel is the Li-Ma significance
of each block partitioned by Bayesian Block. Precursor, quiescent period, fake extended emission and genuine
extended emission are shaded by cyan, gray, green and tan, respectively.
