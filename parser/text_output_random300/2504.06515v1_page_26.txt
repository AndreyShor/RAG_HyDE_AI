This comparison is illustrated in Figure 9 for H0 = 3m0 for q/m0 = 0.5, 1, 5, and
10. For small q = 0.5, both the exact solution (solid curve) and the linear approximation
(dashed curve) follow S-shaped trajectories, whereas the non-relativistic (dotted curve) and
ﬂat electrodynamics (dot-dashed curve) trajectories have symmetric oval shapes. As |q|,
the effect of gravity becomes relatively weak and all trajectories tend to coincide with the
trajectory of ﬂat electrodynamics.

and ﬂat electrodynamics for various values of |q|.
The repulsive case: e1 = e2 = q, |q| ≤qc
In this case, the electromagnetic force is repulsive and competes with the attractive
gravitational force. There is a critical value

of the charge, obtained from setting J 2 = (H −2ϵ ˜p)2 −8q2/κ = 0. If |q| < qc, bounded
and unbounded motions can occur, described, respectively, by the tanh-type (J 2 > 0)
and tan-type solutions (J 2 < 0) for r(τ). Alternatively, (136) gives the critical value of H
for ﬁxed κ and q, or the critical value of κ for ﬁxed H and q, both corresponding to the
transition from bounded to unbounded motion.
The two possibilities are illustrated in Figure 10, which plots r(τ) plots for ﬁxed
H0 = 3m0 (left) or ﬁxed |q|/m0 = 0.1 (right). We see for ﬁxed H0 that the period becomes
larger as |q| increases; once the critical value qc/m0 = 0.2700907567 is exceeded, the motion
becomes unbounded and the separation of the two particles diverges at ﬁnite τ. Likewise,
