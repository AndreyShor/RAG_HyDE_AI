with EFT operators deforming both single and double
Higgs production as well as other processes.
Another
ESPPU26 milestone has been the completion of the FCC
Feasibility Study [4], which updates and improves pre-
vious projections [3, 32] and confirms four interaction
points (IPs) as the baseline scenario for the FCC-ee.
Motivated by these revised HL-LHC and FCC-ee pro-
jections, here we critically revisit the constraints on the
Higgs self-coupling κ3 within a state-of-the-art global
SMEFT analysis [33, 34]. We quantify the synergies be-
tween different input datasets: LHC Run 2, HL-LHC,
FCC-ee@240GeV (always including the √s = 91 and 165
GeV runs), and FCC-ee (full). We determine the inter-
play between SMEFT operators deforming both single
and double Higgs production, evaluate the convergence
of the EFT expansion, and assess the impact of marginal-
isation as compared to one-parameter analyses. We also
examine the impact of these updated projections on UV
completions of the SM that manifest primarily through
modifications of the Higgs self-coupling, in particular for
the custodial electroweak quadruplet model [35].
Settings. Our analysis is based on the SMEFiT frame-
work [36–39], in particular the SMEFiT3.0 release of [33]
extended with RG evolution in [34], and whose matching
to UV-complete models is described in [40].
With re-
spect to [34], our fitting basis is extended to nop = 56
dimension-six operators with the addition of the two-
quark-two-lepton operators Ote, Otℓ, OQe, O(−)
Qℓ, and
O(3)
Qℓwhich are particularly relevant for b¯b and t¯t elec-
troweak production. Our input dataset follows [33] with
the inclusion of the Run 2 constraints on hh production
from ATLAS [20] and adding up to ndat = 446 observ-
ables and cross-sections from LEP (EWPO and diboson)
and the LHC (Higgs, top, and diboson) assuming the SM.
The analysis is performed at both linear and quadratic
order in the EFT expansion, incorporates NLO QCD cor-
rections whenever available, and accounts for RGE evo-
lution throughout.
Projections for top, single Higgs, and diboson observ-
ables at the HL-LHC are extrapolated from Run 2 anal-
yses with the method described in [33]. The projections
for double Higgs production follow the latest HL-LHC
studies from ATLAS [41–43] and CMS [44] as well as
their combination [2]. We complement the projections
for the inclusive signal strength µhh [41] by incorporat-
ing differential information from the dominant b¯bγγ and
b¯bτ +τ −final states [42, 43], see the Supporting Informa-
tion (SI) for further details. We verify that the result-
ing di-Higgs likelihood provides a good approximation to
the ATLAS/CMS combination by reproducing their sen-
sitivity to κ3 in a one-parameter fit. The FCC-ee projec-
tions follow [33] based on four IPs [4], and the associated
theory predictions account for NLO electroweak correc-
tions to the Zh SMEFT cross-sections [29] at √s = 240
and 365 GeV. Theory uncertainties are neglected for the

FCC-ee observables.
In the following, results are presented for Wilson coef-
ficients at a reference scale of µ0 = 250 GeV. We report
bounds on the EFT coefficients as Bayesian credible in-
tervals (C.I.). While these coincide with confidence in-
tervals in the Gaussian limit, they can differ significantly
for non-Gaussian distributions. This discrepancy is most
pronounced in the (HL-)LHC fits, where C.I. tend to pro-
duce looser bounds compared to confidence intervals.
The Higgs trilinear coupling at the HL-LHC. We
consider first the global SMEFT fit at the HL-LHC based
on the inputs described above. To quantify the interplay
between cφ and other operators entering µhh as well as
single Higgs production, Fig. 1 displays the relative defor-
mations to µhh for each coefficient ci together with their
68% C.I. from the HL-LHC quadratic fit with hh projec-
tions excluded. We also show the expected experimental
bound on µhh from [41]. Fig. 1 highlights that the sensi-
tivity of di-Higgs production at the HL-LHC to operators
other than cφ is marginal, as these are better constrained
by other processes. Given this limited cross-talk, we an-
ticipate that individual and marginalized bounds on cφ
and δκ3 will be similar at the HL-LHC.
The upper (lower) panel of Fig. 2 displays the 68%
and 95% C.I. bounds on cφ (δκ3) at µ0 = 250 GeV from
individual and global marginalised fits, both at the lin-
ear and quadratic EFT levels, at the LHC Run 2 and
at the HL-LHC, see Tables I and II for the numerical
values. From these results one finds that, first, the HL-
LHC will improve the 68% C.I. marginalised bounds on
δκ3 from Run 2 by a factor of 5 for both the linear and
quadratic analyses. Second, individual and marginalised
bounds are very similar, especially in the linear EFT
case. Indeed, the individual linear (quadratic) bound of
|δκ3| ≤0.28 (−0.29 ≤δκ3 ≤0.35) becomes |δκ3| ≤0.32
(−0.26 ≤δκ3 ≤0.49) in the marginalised case. This re-
