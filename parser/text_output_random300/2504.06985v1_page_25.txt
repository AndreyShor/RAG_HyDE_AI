⊕mΛm(V ). Therefore, the right-hand side of (B.7) and (B.8) is valued in the fundamental of
SU(n). This allows us to determine the corresponding Chern characters since we know how
to deal with determinants

where, as in the main text, ch(F) = tr(i F
2π) denotes the Chern character evaluated in the
fundamental or defining representation. With this, one can show that
ch[2](F) = 1
2ch2(F) −1
2ch(2F) ,

From this, one can obtain basic trace identities with the corresponding index coefficients (up to
some normalization) plus product of basic traces as well as the dimension of the representation
[m]. In fact, we have computed the indices for the representations [2], [3], [4], (2) and (3) for
the classical Lie algebra An−1, which are useful for our purposes. They are related to the
coefficients u(i)

and given by
Ik([2]) = n −2k−1
Ik([3]) = 1
2(n2 −(1 + 2k)n + 2 · 3k−1)
Ik((2)) = n + 2k−1
Ik((3)) = 1
2(n2 + (1 + 2k)n + 2 · 3k−1)
Ik([4]) = 1
6(n3 −3(2k−1 + 1)n2 + 2(3 · 2k−2 + 3k + 1)n −6 · 4k−1) ,
(B.14)
where k ∈Z. Nonetheless, we need the complete factorization of the corresponding traces for
each of the representations. A cumbersome but straightforward computation gives us
tr[2],(2)F 6 = (n ∓25)trF 6 + 15 trF 4 trF 2 + 10 (trF 3)2 ,
tr[2],(2)F 4 = (n ∓23)trF 4 + 3 (trF 2)2 ,
tr[2],(2)F 2 = (n ∓2)trF 2 ,
(B.15)
where the upper sign is for the antisymmetric [2] and the lower sign is for the symmetric (2)
