Sheet Polarization Formalism for Second-Harmonic Generation
In order to describe the NLO frequency conversion of 2D materials, we follow the widely
accepted approach of calculating the NLO sheet susceptibility [1]. Subsequently, the effective
bulk-like susceptibility can be obtained by multiplication with the film thickness.
Here, we reiterate briefly the derivation from Ref. [2], with small changes to account
for the used setup geometry and pulsed excitation, to obtain an expression for the second-
order sheet susceptibility and to directly connect the fundamental and second-harmonic
average powers. Initially we consider the situation where a 2D polarization sheet (e.g. a

bulk media k (k = 1, 2) with refractive indices nk. The pump beam with frequency ω,
under normal incidence from medium 1, induces a nonlinear polarization P (ωS), which as
a consequence radiates new electric fields E1,2 with the frequency ωS into both media:

where ϵ0 is the vacuum permittivity, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. For second-
harmonic generation we can redefine the emitted frequency ωS = 2ω and specifically write
the nonlinear sheet polarization as:
