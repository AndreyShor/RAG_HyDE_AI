Abstract
High-entropy alloy (HEA) superconductors have garnered signiﬁcant attention
due to their unique characteristics, such as robust superconductivity under
extremely high pressure and irradiation, the cocktail eﬀect, and the enhance-
ment of the upper critical ﬁeld. A high critical current density is another
noteworthy feature observed in HEAs. Several body-centered cubic (bcc) HEAs
have exhibited critical current densities comparable to those of Nb-Ti super-
conducting alloys. Such HEAs hold potential for applications as multifunctional
superconducting wires, a capability rarely achieved in conventional alloys. In
this context, we review recent advancements in research on critical current
densities in bcc HEA superconductors, including Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6,
(TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5, NbScTiZr, and others. Comparative analyses among these
HEAs reveal that both eutectic microstructures, which accompany lattice strain,
and nanosized precipitates play pivotal roles in achieving elevated critical cur-
rent densities across wide magnetic ﬁeld ranges. Furthermore, we propose
several future directions for research. These include elucidating the origin of lat-
tice strain, exploring more ﬁne eutectic microstructures, artiﬁcially introducing
nanoscale pinning sites, improving the superconducting critical temperature, and
investigating the mechanical properties of these materials.
