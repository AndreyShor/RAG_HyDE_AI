Figure 10. Comparison between the concurrence C(s) calculated with different spin bases in the (a) linearly and (b) circularly
polarised laser fields for the high-energy photon with η = 0.2. In (a), the photon is linearly polarised with Γ1 = ±1 and
circularly polarised with Γ3 = ±1 in (b). The solid lines denote the results from the analytical expressions in (12) and (13),
and the dashed and dotted lines show, respectively, the direct calculations with the light-front bispinors and those with the
spin axis along the z-direction. The laser pulse has N = 4 cycles and the intensity ξ = 1.

In the main text, the analytical expressions (12) and (13) of the final density matrix is given based on the light-front
spin basis. The energy and transverse-momentum distribution of the final density matrix ρf(s) and ρf(rx, ry) can
also be acquired by removing the corresponding pre-integrals in (A11) and normalizing respectively with dP/ds and
d2P/drxdry, and could be used to measure the entanglement between the produced particles with different energy
and transverse momentum by calculating the concurrence C(s) and C(rx, ry).
With the above bispinors (A4) and (A6), one can calculate the final density matrix (A11) directly and then acquire
the concurrence of the density matrix. As shown in Fig. 10, the energy spectra of the concurrence C(s) from the
analytical results (13) match exactly with the numerical results calculated directly with the light-front spin basis,
and also match very well with those calculated with the bispinors corresponding to the spin quantization axis along
z-direction. As one can see, the energy spectra of the concurrence C(s) is symmetric at s = 0.5. The sharp changes
around s = 0.15 and s = 0.85 are because of the finite pulse effect.
