Figure 10. To assess the quality of the lattice data fit to the analytical expression (4.9), we first
define the uniformity of a given lattice configuration. This is measured as the absolute difference
between the global maximum and minimum of the action density, with smaller differences indicating
greater uniformity. We present the data for all the 233 configurations for r = 2, k = 1, with lattice
size 32, 8, 8, 8.
The top pannel: the fit of the lattice configuration to the modolus η. The more uniform the configu-
ration, and hence, closer to the constant-F solution, the smaller the value of η.
The bottom pannel: the mean square deviation of the fit as a function of the uniformity of the solution.
The more uniform the solution, the smaller the error.
the noncompact modulus η, which indicates that such modulus can be trusted only for small
enough values. Interestingly, the successful fit of all lattice data with η < 0.4, along with
the plateau observed in both the η-fit and mean squared deviation, suggests that nonlinear
effects may ultimately resolve the noncompactness of η.

Remarks on the moduli space of SU(2) instantons for r ≥2 on the twisted-T4
Here, we discuss an issue similar to the one discussed above for multi-fractional instantons
in SU(N) with gcd(k, r) ̸= r. There, we provided analytical, in section 4.1, and numeri-
