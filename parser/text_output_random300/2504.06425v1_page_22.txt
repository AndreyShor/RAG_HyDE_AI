computed by the SVPC LP algorithm from Section 6.3. For comparison, the computation of one
polyconvex envelope on a 100 × 100 grid using the SVPC LP algorithm takes 8.1 hours on one
CPU while its prediction via neural networks takes only 0.2 seconds. As previously, the neural
network implemented in this example contains 26,121 parameters, comprising both weights and
biases. Once again, this number of parameters remains smaller than the storage required for
only three polyconvex envelopes on a 100 × 100 grid. These aspects once again emphasise the
benefits of using a neural network based representation of the polyconvex envelope for parameter
dependent families of functions for applications in engineering problems.
7. Conclusion
We have demonstrated the effectiveness of a neural network design in predicting polyconvex
envelopes with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results show that such neural
networks can generalise well beyond the learning dataset, enabling fast, multi-query evaluations
and real-time computations. Moreover, we have introduced a splitting strategy which decouples
the isotropic damage problem from the previous time step state, thereby improving the feasibility
and robustness of the training process. Future research will focus on extending this framework to
predict not only the polyconvex envelopes but also their derivatives as well as the incorporation
of determinant constraints into the neural networks, as relevant for engineering applications in
computational mechanics. The results presented in this paper pave the way for complex material
simulations in real engineering contexts.
