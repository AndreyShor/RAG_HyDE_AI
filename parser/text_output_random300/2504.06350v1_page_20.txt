In fact, ax, by are the unit vectors along the quantization axes chosen by Alice and Bob respectively. na, nb
are the Eve’s one with ρ(na, nb) describing her attack. The security is implied by the fact that element
of reality implies local correlations. Other possible advanced attacks introduce delayed measurements
that degrade the state’s purity, hence exposing Eve’s actions.
Thus, the protocol shows that when
S(p) > 2 the matching orientations allow Alice and Bob to generate a secure key (p ∈Q \ L). Note that,
BI violation certifies entanglement without assuming any Hilbert space and guarantees security beyond
quantum correlations, i.e. p ∈NS\Q. Indeed, in the next section we will discuss how Eve could perfectly
eavesdrop on such information by preparing λ = P
i ciλi, a postquantum deterministic and local state
[207, 30] that allows any p ∈NS. But a BI violation with λi must imply p /∈L. On the other hand,
any λ such that p /∈L but deterministic as Eve would desire implies p /∈NS, admitting faster than light
signaling [212] (see discussion in Fig. 5d).
3.3. BHK05 – against collective no-signalling attacks
Eve, with control of the source and the fabrication of Alice and Bob’s devices, for her collective attack
prepares a postquantum state λ so that she keeps a subsystem for her and 2n subsystems where at each
run Alice and Bob share a singlet state [207]. Alice and Bob randomly choose respectively Ai = Xri

Bi = Xri

channel after all the measurements are performed. Given n = MN 2 with M ∈N, the protocol continues

| · | is the cardinality. The outcomes remain confidential only for one specific pair, (As, Bs) = (Xs, Xs+c),
where c ∈{−1, 0, 1}. The outcomes for all other pairs (Aj, Bj), with j = 1, . . . , s −1, s + 1, . . . , Mi,
are revealed. The protocol is aborted if there exists any pair (Aj, Bj) = (Xj, Xj+c) where the outcome
is not anticorrelated, as this would indicate a potential man-in-the-middle attack on the communica-
tion. If no such uncorrelated pair is found, the secret bit is defined by the outcomes as = ¯bs of the
unrevealed pair (As, Bs). The state λ defines measurement probabilities P λ
ABE where A = {A1, . . . , An},
B = {B1, . . . , Bn} are the players’ choices and E = {E1} is the time independent12 Eve’s collective
measurement that she performs after all the players’ measurements. Then for any partition A = A1 ∪A2,
B = B1 ∪B2 and E = E1 ∪E2 the no–signalling in Eq. (7) imposes pλ
A1B1E1 = pλ
A1B1E1|A2B2E2. It
signifies that she cannot prepare two physical systems in a joint state such that a local measurement on
one system may transfer information to another, distinct system.
Proof of security – Let (Aj, Bj) the random choice obtained with probability 1/N 2 with outcome
(aj, bj). The following BI (similar to chained BI [214, 151])

bounds Eve’s knowledge.
Lemma 2. For ϵ > 0 let a postquantum state λ that determines the probability P λ(pass) > ϵ. The
protocol pass =⇒pλ(as ̸= bs|pass) > 1 −1/(2MNϵ).
Lemma 3. Given the lemma 2, the no-signaling condition and the chain rule for conditional probability
=⇒1 −1/(2MNϵ) < ts.
Theorem 1. Eve’s knowledge, i.e. the probability that she can correctly guess the secret bit, by measuring
her subsystem gives ts ≤1 −δδ′/(3N) < 1 −1/(2MNϵ) for N ≫1.
Proof. By contradiction, suppose that Eve gets an outcome e0 with probability δ > 0 such that P λ(as =
b, bs = ¯b|As = Xk, Bs = Xk+c, e0) > (1 + δ′)/2. Then, it is straightforward that conditioned only on the
12Eve’s measurement options and their outcome probabilities stay constant over time, preventing her from dynamically
adapting her strategy to compromise the security.
If not, the theory would be pathological even if no-signaling is still
satisfied [213]
