It is tempting to examine Hubble photographs to look for the Euler two-centre solutions
and the corresponding elliptical spiral, taking into account the vastly different length
and time scales of observer and the observed astronomical scene. Needless to say if the
Schr¨odinger state of the cloud includes ψK contributions, these states will dominate the
dynamics in a neighbourhood of the corresponding orbit. In both cases there are cut
singularities on the major axis of the elliptical orbit consistent with barred galaxies.
3. The Effective Potential, Stability of Circular Orbits and Potential Wells
We start by considering KLMN circular orbits for toy neutron stars and their stability,
then turn to more general periodic equatorial orbitals and their equations including a
Kepler equation, working our way towards the Feynman-Kac formula needed in this
format.
Simple physical insights have proven invaluable as you will see, but in our
opinion the mathematical insights afforded us by the giants of the subject are key. In
particular they reveal how important Brownian motion is in relation to the semi-classical
orbits here and the ideas of some of the giants of our subject. The methods pioneered
here we hope will help in more general astronomical settings in modelling the physical
behaviours observed e.g. by Hubble.
3.1. Stability of Circular Orbits
Here the effective potential, Veff, is defined by

(See Ref. [27]). In seeking stable circular orbits, with radius a0 (> 0), Veff needs to have
a local minimum at r = a0, so it is necessary first that in the simplest of cases
