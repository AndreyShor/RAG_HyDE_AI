detect in collider experiments. In contrast, the long decay volumes of beam-dump experi-
ments allow for greater sensitivity to these types of particles since they are able to decay
inside the experiment and be detected [68, 69].
The most sensitive beam-dump experiments for leptophilic ALPs are the ones employ-
ing lepton beams. Concretely, we consider the E137 beam-dump experiment performed
at SLAC [45] to search for neutral metastable particles, as well as the NA64 beam-dump
experiment running at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron. The latter performs three
different types of searches:
• The standard invisible mode of the NA64 experiment differs from E137 and figure 2
in that the experiment employs an active beam dump. Instead of the detector being
downstream of the target and detecting potential decay products, the target itself is
the detector, and the experiment searches for missing energy [46].
• In contrast to the invisible setup, NA64 run in visible mode uses a similar search
strategy to the one employed by E137 [47].
• The NA64µ experiment [49] employs a muon beam to search for new particles that
couple primarily to muons, such as the gauge boson of a new U(1)Lµ−Lτ gauge sym-
metry. Clearly, this muon mode also possesses great sensitivity to muonphilic ALP
models.
The details of the different experiments are summarised in appendix A.
In the remainder of this section, we explain how the constraints for these experiments
are calculated. Complementary constraints from other types of experiments will be dis-
cussed in section 4.
