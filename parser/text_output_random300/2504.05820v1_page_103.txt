Table 3.3: The values of the experimental χ2 per data point for the different groups of processes entering
the NNPDF4.0 determination as well as for the total dataset. We compare the results of the
baseline NNPDF4.0 fit (c = ¯c) with the results of this work (c ̸= ¯c).
Fit quality and data impact.
We compare the fit quality for the PDF determination presented
here with c ̸= ¯c to the published NNPDF4.0 determination with c = ¯c, by showing in Table 3.3
the experimental χ2 per data point for different groups of processes and for the total dataset.
We refer to [109] for the definition of the dataset and of the χ2 and the process categories (see
in particular [109, Tab. 5.1]).
The largest reduction in absolute χ2 upon allowing for a non-vanishing charm valence compo-
nent is in collider DIS (i.e. HERA), and the largest reduction in χ2 in charged-current collider
DIS. There the largest impact is seen in the large Q2, large x bins, consistent with the obser-
vation that the intrinsic charm PDFs are localized at large x. Note that HERA data for the F c
2
charm structure function, that are included in the fit, have no impact on intrinsic charm because
they are in the medium-to-low x region where the charm PDF is dominated by the perturbative
component.
Parametrization basis dependence.
Because here we are determining a difference between
PDFs, it is especially important to check stability upon choice of basis. In the evolution basis,
the charm PDFs are parametrized through the two combinations T15 and V15 of Eq. (1.61), at
a scale Q = Q0 = 1.65 GeV. In the flavor basis, they are parametrized as c(x, Q) and ¯c(x, Q).
Note that in neither case the total and valence combinations c± are elements of the basis.
In Fig. 3.17 the xc± PDFs found using either basis are compared. Agreement at the one sigma
level is found for all x. The main qualitative features are independent of the basis choice,
specifically the presence of a positive valence peak around x ∼0.3 for xc−. Results in the flavor
