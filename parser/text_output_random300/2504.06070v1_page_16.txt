nonlinear and multiscale, our architecture employs a structure similar to 3D U-Net to build complex
mappings and multiscale features.
We present the detailed structure of our model, using the complex mapping from c(≤t), ψ to u(t′)
as an example (Figure S3). The structures of the remaining mapping functions are similar to this.

NOWCASTNET SETTING AND RESULT
It is important to note that NowcastNet utilizes a deterministic prediction model (Evolution network)
combined with a probabilistic generative model (GAN). Given that this is a deterministic prediction
task, the Evolution network outperforms the combined generative model (GAN) in most evaluation
metrics. In the main text, we selected the best prediction results from the deterministic model. In
this section, we provide the complete results.
B
DATA AND EVALUATION
In this section, we provide a detailed explanation of the data and evaluation metrics, including details
such as the data generation method, data scale, and the specifics of the prediction tasks.
