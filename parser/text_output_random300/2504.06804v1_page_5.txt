A Few Remarks Concerning Application of the Lifshitz Theory

of Si obtained using the Clausius-Mossotti model is claimed.8 As an example, the
negative imaginary part of εCM(T∆, ω) at T = 573.1 K is shown in Fig. 1.
An approximation of the ﬁtting parameters by quadratic functions made in
Eq. (11) of Ref. 8 does not remedy this defect. By using the coeﬃcients of quadratic
functions presented in Table III of Ref. 8, one ﬁnds that ImεCM(T∆, ω) remains
negative in the range of T∆from 0.375 to 1.469, i.e., from approximately T = 403 K
to 723 K. This is even a wider temperature region than that obtained directly from
the ﬁtting parameters of Tables I and II do not using any approximation.
One additional remark concerning the dielectric permittivity of Si obtained8 by
using the Lorentz-Dirac model

is in order. Similar to the above analysis, we see that the term of εLD with k = 1
computed with the ﬁtting parameters deﬁned in Table IV of Ref. 8 possesses the
negative imaginary part at all values of T∆from 0 to 2.833. Based on the laws
of thermodynamics, one concludes that such a result contradicts to the physical
meaning of this term as describing the ﬁrst absorption peak of monocrystalline Si.
The obtained dielectric permittivities were used to calculate the coeﬃcients C3
and C4 in the short-range, C3(T∆)/z3, and long-range, C4(T∆)/z4, asymptotic be-
havior of the interaction potential between a Si plate and a He atom spaced at the
height z above it. Calculations were performed by means of the Lifshitz theory of
atom–plate interaction using the dielectric permittivity of Si along the imaginary
frequency axis. The obtained results cannot be considered as fully reliable even if
to admit that the frequency regions, where the relatively small in magnitude imag-
inary part of εCM is negative, make rather small impact on εCM(iω). It should be
also kept in mind that the “excellent” analytic expressions for the dielectric per-
mittivity of Si may be used not only for calculations of the atom-wall potentials,
but in studying diverse physical phenomena fully determined by the behavior of
this permittivity at relatively low real frequencies, where the suggested expressions
are rudely wrong. One can mention the Casimir and Casimir-Polder forces out of
thermal equilibrium, the radiative heat transfer, the near-ﬁeld spectroscopy, etc.
