Step 3: Correctness. After iteration ℓ= k + 1, we must have at most two nonzero entries in each row since initially, Q has at
most one nonzero value per each row, and by Eq. (12), we only modify one entry of each row. Let r be the largest row index
such that Qrℓ̸= 0, ℓ= k + 1. After the next iteration ℓ= k + 2, we have two cases: (1) if the capacity of row r is used up by
pk+1, then the ﬁrst nonzero entry of column k + 2 starts at row r. In this case, Q has at most two nonzero entries per row; (2) if
some capacity of row r is left, i.e., P
j Qrj ≤1/N, then ﬁrst nonzero entry of column k + 2 starts at row r + 1, giving rise to
three nonzero entries for this row. Note that the above argument between iterations k + 1 and k + 2 holds for any two iterations
ℓand ℓ+ 1. Hence, we conclude that after iteration ℓ≥k + 1, the following conditions are true:
1. P
i Qij = pj for 1 ≤j ≤ℓ;
2. There are at most three nonzero entries in each row of Q.
Now, proceed with the above argument until ℓ= N, we must have: (1) P
j Qij = 1/N for 1 ≤i ≤N; (2) P
i Qij = pj for
1 ≤j ≤N; (3) there are at most three nonzero entries in each row of Q.
Next, we show that using twice as many q-vectors, we can represent the probability vector p with 2-sparse probabilities. The
basic idea is that a 3-sparse vector can always be written as a uniform mixture of two 2-sparse vectors: Let p be a 3-sparse
vector with 0 < pa ≤pb ≤pc, for indices a, b, c. Then we deﬁne the probability vectors q1 and q2 as follows: (q1)a = 2pa,
(q1)c = 1 −2pa, (q2)b = 2pb, and (q2)c = 1 −2pb. The correctness can be veriﬁed by q1, q2 are 2-sparse, q1/2 + q2/2 = p,
and pa ≤1/2 and pb ≤1/2.
Lemma 5. Every N-dimensional probability vector p can be expressed as a uniform mixture of 2N 2-sparse probability vectors.
That is, there exists a set {q(i)}i of 2N 2-sparse probability vectors such that
p =
X
i
1
2N q(i).
Proof. Taking Lemma 5, we know there exists a set {q(i)}i of N 3-sparse probability vectors such that p = P
i
1
N q(i). Now,
for each q(i), if it is 3-sparse but not 2-sparse, we can always split it into two 2-sparse vectors using the observation before the
lemma, i.e., q(i) = q1(i)/2 + q2(i)/2; If q(i) is 2-sparse, we simply produce two copies of it. This construction satisﬁes the
conditions of the lemma.
With these lemmas in place, we can now prove the main theorem.
Theorem 1 (Exact universality of IQP-circuits with hidden qubits). For any target probability distribution p over {0, 1}n, there
exists an IQP circuit acting on n visible qubits and m = n + 1 hidden qubits that produces p exactly when we measure the ﬁnal
n qubits.
Proof. By Lemma 2 the reduced density matrix of an IQP circuit with m hidden qubits can be exactly written as sum of 2m pure
states density matrices |ψk⟩⟨ψk|. The output distribution will be a uniform mixture of the distributions obtained from measuring
one of the |ψk⟩states in the basis speciﬁed by Pauli-X eigenstates. Each |ψk⟩can be expressed as a superposition of strings
of Pauli-X eigenstates, and the probability of observing the string b ∈{0, 1}n is given by |⟨˜b|ψk⟩|2 with |˜b⟩= H⊗n|b⟩. In
Lemma 3 we have shown how we can encode any 2-sparse distribution in |ψk⟩. On the other hand, Lemma 5 states that any
probability distribution over {0, 1}n can be decomposed as a uniform sum of 2n+1 such 2-sparse distributions. Therefore, by
choosing m = n + 1, we have sufﬁcient expressive power to represent any target distribution p exactly using an IQP circuit with
hidden qubits.

Remark on optimality
We note that it is not clear if the construction of the main Theorem above is optimal in terms of the number of ancillary qubits,
i.e., hidden units for the worst-case distributions. On the one hand, the purpose of this construction is to generate a particular
reduced density matrix over the last n qubits, and it is well known that this can be puriﬁed using at most n additional qubits.
However, in general, the states on the purifying system will then not correspond to UMA states, this puriﬁed state may not be
obtainable by an IQP circuit in general. An n instead of n + 1 qubit overhead could also be obtained if any N-dimensional
probability vector could be decomposed to a uniform mixture of the sum of just N 2-sparse probability vectors (we achieve
3-sparse). We do not have a strong argument that this is impossible, but we have equally failed to provide a provably correct
construction. Another route to reducing resources is to encode more than 2 outcome distributions in the states |ψk⟩. However,
already for 2 qubit (4 dimensional) case, the non-universality results of [1] (page 47) imply that there exist distributions that
cannot be encoded into UMA states. In general, any n-qubit UMA state characterized by 2n −1 phases (θj)j (counting for the
global phase) can only generate probability vectors with probabilities expressible with pk ∝|1 + P2n
j=2(−1)z·jeiθj|2, which,
as said, do not include all distributions already for n = 2. Already, one hidden unit allows us to recover arbitrary convex
combinations of any two such distributions, and further hidden units allow for more complicated combinations. The minimal
point at which this becomes universal we leave for future work.
