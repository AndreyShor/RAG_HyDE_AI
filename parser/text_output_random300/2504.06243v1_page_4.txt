We will be computing correlation functions in an excited state. Since the path integral naturally
computes in-out correlation functions, the Keldysh procedure accommodates in-in correlation func-
tions by taking a time contour that runs forward and then backward, so that we start and end
on the same initial state. It is standard to denote the field on the upper branch of the contour
(running forwards in time) by Φ+ and the field on the lower branch by Φ−, so the Lagrangian
becomes L(Φ+) −L(Φ−), see e.g., [18]. The Green’s function becomes a two-by-two matrix of
Green’s functions. After a field rotation,
ϕ = 1
2(Φ+ + Φ−) ,
η = Φ+ −Φ−,
(2.2)
the Lagrangian becomes,
L = ∂η∂ϕ −λ
3!(ηϕ3 + 1
4η3ϕ) ,
(2.3)
and the Keldysh and retarded Green’s functions take the form, respectively,
GK
k = ⟨ϕ∗
kϕk⟩= 2πδ(k2)(nk + 1
2) ,
GR
k = ⟨ϕ∗
kηk⟩=
i
k2 + iϵk0
,
(2.4)
where we are using relativistic notation, k2 = k2
0 −k2. The interaction term with one η field
is referred to as the classical interaction vertex, as it survives in the classical limit, while the
interaction term with η3 is the quantum interaction vertex.
We assume that we are in a state that is time-independent and Gaussian, in which mode k has
occupation number nk ∼|k|−γ, with nk ≫1. When computing the Keldysh Green’s function from
the free action, it is the boundary conditions at the initial time that establish the (nk +1/2) factor
appearing in the expression. From the form of the correlators (2.4), we can assign the following
dimensions (in momentum space) to ϕ and η, which we denote by ∆ϕ, ∆η, respectively: 1
∆ϕ = −γ + D + 2
2
,
∆η = γ −D −2
2
,
momentum space . (2.5)
Scaling dimensions are more commonly written in position space, and are related to the momentum
space dimensions through ∆→D −∆, giving the position space dimensions,
∆ϕ = D −γ −2
2
,
∆η = γ + D −2
2
,
position space .
(2.6)
As a consistency check, setting γ = 0 recovers the standard (vacuum) scaling dimensions, while
for general γ we have ∆ϕ + ∆η = D −2, which is necessary from (2.3).
1We are dropping the 1/2 in the Keldysh Green’s function, since we are assuming nk ≫1. The appearance of D
in the dimension is because of the momentum conserving delta function i.e., what is really meant by the correlator
is ⟨ϕ∗
kϕp⟩= nkδ(k2)δD(k−p).
