characters, which can be expressed as

The vectors u(i)
r , i ∈{1, . . . , 18} are the nonzero group-theory coefficients relevant to our
problem, and they are a function only of the representation r. Depending on the algebra
under consideration, some of these coefficients may vanish identically. For instance, for simple
Lie algebras, we know that trr(F) = 0, whereas, for real representations trr(F l) vanishes for
l odd.
Using these expressions, the anomaly polynomial (3.2) can be rewritten as
PG(R, F) = 1

Here, we have set the coefficient b = 1, since it is fixed to that value by demanding matching of
the pure gravitational anomaly (specifically, the p3
1 or p1 p2 terms). As a result, the boundary
condition (2.6) depends only on a. Imposing (3.9) also leads to a system of linear conditions,
