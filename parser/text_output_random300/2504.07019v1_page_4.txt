parts (top and bottom panels) for a system in the SC
phase, and observe clear RG flow between LM and SC
fixed points. Although the imaginary part of EN is fi-
nite for early iterations and initially grows, it decays to
zero as the stable fixed point is reached. Interestingly,
Im(EN) becomes large along the crossover between fixed
points.
The crossover at Nc between LM and SC can
be interpreted as a ‘temperature’ scale TK ∼DΛ−Nc/2
corresponding to Kondo screening, and we numerically
extract the relation TK ∼De−2DJR/|J|2 from the NH-
NRG data in the weak-coupling regime [46], consistent
with the perturbative scaling result of Ref. [25].
Fig. 1(c) shows the analogous plots for a system in
the LM phase, which starts off close to the LM fixed
point, evolves under RG, but then returns back to it at
large N. This anomalous RG-flow reversion, identified in
Ref. [25], is further illustrated in panels (d,e) which show
the evolution of two particular eigenvalues in the Argand
plane, with increasing N following the direction of the
arrows. Green points show the fixed point eigenvalues of
the Hermitian Kondo model to which they converge.
NH Pseudogap Kondo.– To further showcase the ver-
satility of the NH-NRG method, we now turn to the NH
pseudogap Kondo model. The pseudogap bath is char-
acterized by a density of states ρ(ω) = ρ0|ω|rΘ(D −|ω|)
with power-law exponent r > 0, and we focus on the
particle-hole symmetric case.
The standard Hermitian
version of the model has been extensively studied using
a variety of methods including perturbative RG [45, 52]
and NRG [53, 54].
A transition between LM and SC
phases upon increasing JR through the critical value
J∗
R(r) was found for 0 < r < 1
2, with r = 1
2 itself playing
the role of a lower-critical dimension rc, beyond which
the critical point disappears and Kondo screening is no
longer possible [45]. By contrast, for the NH variant with
J ∈C we find that rc ≡rc(JI) gets shifted to larger val-
ues as JI increases. Fig. 2(a) shows the phase transition
boundaries obtained from NH-NRG as a function of JR
and r for different JI. The blue line is for the Hermitian
case with JI = 0, which is seen to diverge at rc(0) = 1
2 as
expected from Ref. [53]. For JI > 0 and 0 < r < 1
2 our
analysis of the eigenvalue RG flow shows that the sta-
ble fixed points obtained at large N are identical to the
Hermitian pseudogap Kondo fixed points. Fig. 2 shows
the flow diagrams for JR < J∗
R in the LM phase (panel
b) and for JR > J∗
R in the SC phase (c). Likewise, the
LM phase for r > 1
2 in panel (d) shows RG flow to the
standard Hermitian LM fixed point. However, in the re-
gion r > 1
2 and JR > J∗
R that would be forbidden in the
Hermitian limit, we find an entirely novel stable fixed
point, see panel (e). Remarkably, in this phase the sta-
ble fixed point is intrinsically non-Hermitian, with a per-
sistent complex eigenspectrum and Im(EN) that do not
decay with N. We dub this fixed point CSC for complex
strong coupling. We leave the detailed study of this phase
to future work. This behavior and the structure of the

where the first line describes the isolated bath and impu-
rity orbital, while the tunnel-coupling between them is
given in the second line. Non-Hermiticity can be intro-
duced by making any/all of the parameters ϵd, Ud or V
complex. We focus here on the case where V ∈C and the
bath has a flat density of states. Various aspects of An-
derson models describing loss and dephasing have been
considered before [30–33, 35], but our aim here is to con-
firm the mapping between NH AIM and Kondo models.

turbative and applies strictly only in the limit of large
