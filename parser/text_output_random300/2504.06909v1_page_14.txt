and 40‚ó¶in the descending branches. For the eddy component, divergence is positive below 40‚ó¶
and negative on the poleward flank of the jet.
In the superrotating state (Fig. 5, panels b and c), the most evident change is that the poleward
eddy energy flux (green curve) increases at all latitudes, while the magnitude of the energy flux
associated with the MMC (orange curve) decreases at all latitudes. The former is broadly consistent
with the appearance of a turbulent jet at the equator, while the latter can be explained qualitatively
by the collapse of the Hadley cells at low latitudes and the poleward shift of the Ferrell cells at high
latitudes (the two regions are separated by a buffer region where energy transport changes due to
the MMC are small, around 40‚ó¶).
The partial compensation of these opposing effects determines the pattern of total poleward
energy transport changes (blue curve), which is negative in the tropics (roughly until 20‚ó¶for the
