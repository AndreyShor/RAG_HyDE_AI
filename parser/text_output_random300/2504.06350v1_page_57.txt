General case of n > 2 different preparations [97]. Consider a given ensemble of states |ψx⟩n−1
x=0 that Alice
can prepare, and that Bob can perform binary measurements {B0|y, B1|y}n−1
y=0 corresponds to projections
onto the polarization states orthogonal to the states that Alice prepares. Alice randomly chooses a pair
of integers r = (r0, r1) where 0 ≤r0 ≤r1 ≤n −1 and a bit k and sends the state |ψ⟩x=rk to Bob, who
randomly chooses an integer y (0 ≤y ≤n −1) and performs the binary measurement {B0|y, B1|y}. If the
outcome is b = 1, the round will be discarded, otherwise b = 0. Bob then asks Alice to reveal r. If y = r0
or y = r1 Bob informs Alice that the round is conclusive otherwise it is aborted. The main assumption
concerns the complex pairwise overlaps between preparation states, which is encompassed in the Gram
matrix G, whose entries are given by Gij = ⟨ψi| ψj⟩.
5.2.2. Security analysis
Eve’s information about the secret bit k is bounded by assuming that the Gram matrix G of the set
of encoding states is fully characterized and that the probabilities p(b|x, y) are perfectly estimated by
Alice and Bob. There is no other restriction on the protocol, no bound on the dimension, and neither
any characterization on the prepared states, transmission channel, or measurement device. To attack the
protocol, Eve can correlate herself to the state Alice sent and design Bob’s measurement. Moreover, Eve
can benefit from having a quantum memory. By denoting psucc as the probability that a round is not
discarded, the asymptotic key rate is lower bounded by using the Devetak-Winter key rate formula and
gives
rRDI ≥[H(k|Eve, succ) −H(k|Bob, succ)]p(succ) ≥[−log2(pg(e = k|succ)) −h(Q)]p(succ).
Here the second inequality comes from the fact that Bob’s entropy can be upper-bounded as H(k|Bob, succ) ≤
h(Q) and Eve’s conditional entropy can be lower-bounded by conditional min-entropy Hmin(k|Eve, succ) =
−log2(pg(e = k|succ)). pg(e = k|succ) is the maximal probability that Eve guess the bit k correctly,
and is the only quantity that needs to be upper bounded to give a lower bound on rRDI, since the
QBER Q and p(succ) can be extracted from the observed statistics p(b|x, y). The guessing probability
pg(e = k|succ) = p(e=k,succ)
p(succ)
then can be upper bound by an upper bound on p(e = k, succ). In [97], it is
shown that by using SDP an upper bound on p(e = x, succ) can be obtained.
SDP method for upper bounding p(e = x, succ). Let us define the set {Si}s−1
i=0 where its elements are
monomials of the operators Bb|y and Ee|µ (Eve’s measurements). The ns × ns moment matrix Γ then
can be defined as

p(e = x, succ) is given by

The first condition is the overlap constraint between the sets of states. The second equation ensures
that the moment matrix Γ is compatible with the observed correlation p(b|x, y). The matrices Fk and
the coefficients fk are Hermitian and complex, respectively, and are defined to satisfy the constraints
on the measurement operators for Bob and Eve.
These constraints include positivity, completeness,
commutativity [Mb|y, Ee|y] = 0, and the requirement that both Mb|y and Ee|y are projectors.
