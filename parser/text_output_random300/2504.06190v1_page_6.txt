No-scale supergravity
we can split the NT chiral multiplets as ϕi = (ϕα, ϕbk), and again the no-
scale properties are preserved as long as the identity GαGα = 3 holds and
the equations ⟨Gbk⟩= ⟨Da⟩= 0 admit solutions. A class of no-scale models
studied in [14], and inspired by superstring compactifications, is based on
a superpotential W(zbk) that does not depend on the zα, and on a Kähler
function that, expanding for small field fluctuations around ⟨zbk⟩= 0, reads:

In the above equations, Y is a homogeneous function of degree 3, depending
only on the combinations rα ≡zα + zα. In other words, rαYα = 3 Y , where
it is unambiguous to define Yα ≡∂Y/(∂rα) ≡∂Y/(∂zα) ≡∂Y/(∂zα), and
from this GαGα = 3 follows immediately. The nA × nA matrices KA

ρbkAblBPbkAblB. We also assume that the gauge field metric, Re fab, is a homoge-
neous function of the variables rα of degree λf, i.e. rα(Re fab)α = λf Re fab
(λf = 0, 1). For the models under consideration, the general supergravity
mass formulae undergo dramatic simplifications. The spin 0 fields zα in the
supersymmetry breaking sector have classically vanishing masses, therefore
their masses will be induced by quantum corrections. After subtracting the
goldstino, their spin 1/2 partners ψα have all masses equal to the gravitino
mass m3/2. Furthermore, remembering that the chiral superfields zbk should
contain the quark, lepton and Higgs superfields of the Minimal Supersym-
metric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), we can derive some predic-
tions for the explicit mass parameters of the MSSM. Similar predictions were
derived in [15], for special goldstino directions and under slightly different as-
sumptions. For the gaugino masses we find that, if there is unification of the
gauge couplings, (Re f)ab = δab/g2

3/2 (λf = 0, 1). As for
the spin 1/2 fermions ψbk, we should distinguish two main possibilities. Those
in chiral representations of the gauge group, such as quarks and leptons, can-
not have gauge-invariant mass terms. Those in real representations of the
gauge group, such as the Higgsino fields eH1 and eH2 of the MSSM, can have
both a ‘superpotential mass’, proportional to WbkAblB, and a ‘gravitational’
mass, proportional to PbkAblB, in their mass terms (M1/2)bkAblB. Both these
terms can in principle contribute, in a suitable flat limit, to the superpotential
‘µ-term’ of the MSSM, and to the associated off-diagonal (analytic-analytic)
scalar mass term m2
