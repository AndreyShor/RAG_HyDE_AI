1.2.2
Summary of results and outline of the paper
The first focus of this paper is the study of the moduli space of self-dual backgrounds of
charge Q = r/N for different choices of k, on a tuned T4, with ∆(r, k, ℓ) = 0, or rℓL3L4 =
kL1L2. For these values of Lµ, the constant-F solution (1.2) is self-dual. Here, we find that:
1. gcd(k, r) = r: For k such that gcd(k, r) = r, there is a 4r dimensional moduli space
parameterized by the constant holonomies S0. All self-dual backgrounds have the same
constant F, and the constant holonomies comprise all moduli of the ∆(r, k, ℓ) = 0
self-dual solution.
First, we show this analytically in section 3. We consider general self-duality preserving
fluctuations (orthogonal to small gauge transformations) around the constant-F self-
dual solution, parameterized exactly like in (1.4), but now on the tuned T4. We expand
the self-duality condition in a formal series in the nonlinearity.
We call this the λ-
expansion, where λ is a parameter introduced to count the order of the nonlinear terms
(as advocated in [50–52]). The expansion used to solve the self-duality condition of
eqn. (2.18) for (1.4) is now, in contrast with (1.5):
S ∼S0 + λS1 + λ2S2 + ...,
W ∼W0 + λW1 + λ2W2 + ...,
(1.6)
Proceeding with iteratively solving the self-duality condition in powers of λ, we find
that when gcd(k, r) = r, only the constant holonomies S0 are nonzero. All other terms,
W0, S1, W1, S2, W2, ..., are set to zero, order by order in the λ-expansion.
Second, in section 3.2, we confirm this analytic result using the “exact” (multi-) frac-
tional instantons for N = 3, obtained by minimizing the lattice action for k = r = 1, on
a T4 with ∆(1, 1, 2) = 0, or 2L3L4 = L1L2 (see Figure 1), as well as k = r = 2, on a T4
with ∆(2, 2, 1) = 0, or L3L4 = L1L2) (see Figure 3). In each case, we find that when the
T4 is tuned so that ∆(r, r, 3−r) = 0, the lattice minimization only produces constant-F
solutions. As a check of the numerical simulations, we also study the moduli space of
these constant-F solutions by computing the winding Wilson loops of the numerical
solutions. We find precise agreement with the winding Wilson loops, calculated for the
analytic solutions in [27]. The relevant expressions for SU(3) that we plot are presented
in Appendix B. See Figures 2 and 4.
Thus, we conclude that for gcd(k, r) = r and ∆(r, k, ℓ) = 0 (or rℓL3L4 = kL1L2), all
charge r/N multi-fractional self-dual instantons are constant-F ones, with moduli given
by the 4r constant holonomies. Upon detuning the T4, a small-∆expansion around
such backgrounds produces a unique (in the sense of footnote 9) nonabelian solution,
determined by the constant-F abelian background (1.2) and the S0 holonomies.
2. gcd(k, r) ̸= r: Next, we turn to a study of the space of self-dual solutions of charge r/N
and k such that gcd(k, r) ̸= r, on a tuned T4 with ∆(r, k, ℓ) = 0, or rℓL3L4 = kL1L2.
While the constant-F self-dual background (1.2) still exists, perturbing it by self-duality
