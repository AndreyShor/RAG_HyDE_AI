Proof. Let [a, b] be an interval of diameter at least r containing the origin. From Proposition
6.6 one can deduce that the space of charge transporters ⟨F(Z)−|F(Z)+⟩, with Z ∈Z(C), are
obtained as limits of linear combinations of morphism X[a,b] →X[a,b] of the form
(idX[a,−1] ⊗g)q∗v∗
1v2p(f ⊗idX[0,b]),
where f ∈End(X[a,−1]), g ∈End(X[0,b]), v1, v2 ∈Hom(Y, X[a,b] ⊗Zb) and p, q ∈Hom(X[a,b], Y )
for some irreducible object Y . Thus, it suﬃces to show that an arbitrary morphism X[a,b] can
be as linear combinations of morphisms of the form q∗v∗
1v2p.
By complete reducibility, it suﬃces to show that, for [a, b] large enough, every f : X[a,b] →
X[a,b] factoring as f = λq∗p for projections p, q: X[a,b] →Y , where Y ∈Irr(Cia,ib), ﬁts in a
commutative diagram of the form
X[a,b]
Y
Y
X[a,b]
X[a,b] ⊗Zb
f
p
λ
v2
q∗
v∗
1
q∗u∗
for some Z ∈Z(C) having Za in the a-component. This can be achieved by taking any Z such
that X[a,b] has non-trivial Y -isotypical component, and one can take v2 to be an element such
that v2p ∈Hom(X[a,b], X[a,b] ⊗Zb) is part of a basis for Hom(X[a,b], X[a,b] ⊗Zb) over End(X[a,b]),
and similarly for v1 and v1q, as in the proof of the previous Lemma.

6.4. Local alignment. Finally, we prove that our model is locally aligned 5.6.
Proposition 6.7. As an A-bimodule, B1 is isomorphic to F(Zreg). In particular, the abstract
spin chain A• is locally aligned.
Proof. We ﬁrst recall that A can be decomposed as
M
Y ∈Irr C0
lim
−→Hom(X[−k,−1] ⊗Y, X[−k,−1]) ⊗Hom(X[0,k], Y ⊗X[0,k])
as a B0-bimodule, with comparison maps
(6.4)
Hom(X[−k,−1] ⊗Y, X[−k,−1]) ⊗Hom(X[0,k], Y ⊗X[0,k]) →End(X[−k,k])
given by f ⊗g 7→(f ⊗id)(id⊗g). The algebra structure of A corresponds to the coend structure
of L
Y Y ∗⊠Y ∈C0 ⊠C0.
Then, A ⊗B0 A can be written as
(6.5)
M
Y,Y ′∈Irr C0
lim
−→Hom(X[−k,−1] ⊗Y ′ ⊗Y, X[−k,−1]) ⊗Hom(X[0,k], Y ′ ⊗Y ⊗X[0,k]).
By the Frobenius reciprocity this is isomorphic to
M
Y,Y ′∈Irr C0
lim
−→Hom(X[−k,−1] ⊗Y ′, X[−k,−1] ⊗Y ∗) ⊗Hom(X[0,k], Y ′ ⊗Y ⊗X[0,k]),
which maps to F(Zreg) by a B0-bimodule isomorphism analogous to (6.4).
It remains to check that this is an homomorphism of A-bimodules. The coend description of
the product of A implies that the right A-module structures are compatible.
To compare the left A-module structures, we consider another functor F ′ : Z(C) →DHR(A•)
given by
F ′(Z) = lim
−→HomC(X[−k,−1] ⊗Z∗⊗X[0,k], X[−k,k]).
Then the half-braiding and the Frobenius reciprocity gives isomorphisms
HomC(X[−k,k], X[−k,−1] ⊗Z ⊗X[0,k]) →HomC(X[−k,−1] ⊗Z∗⊗X[0,k], X[−k,k]),
