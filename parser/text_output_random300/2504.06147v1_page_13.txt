For various equivalent definitions of the hyperdeterminant, and a discussion of its properties as a
generalisation of the usual determinant, see [42]. Let x(1) ∈CL1, x(2) ∈CL2, ..., x(r) ∈CLr denote
vectors in complex spaces of dimension L1, L2, ..., Lr. Then consider the multilinear form
f(x(1), x(2), ..., x(r)) =
X
1≤i1≤L1
...
1≤ir≤Lr
aiii2 ... irx(1)
i1 x(2)
i2 ... x(r)
ir .

The hyperdeterminant H(f) of f, when it exists, is a polynomial in the entries ai that vanishes if
and only if there is a list of nonzero vectors (x(1), x(2), ..., x(r)) such that
f(x(1), x(2), ..., x(k−1), y(k), x(k+1), ..., x(r)) = 0
for all 1 ≤k ≤r and for all y(k) ∈CLk.
(2.32)
Note that, as in Theorem 1.4 of [42], H(f) exists if and only if Lk −1 ≤P
j̸=k(Lj −1) for all k.
The degree of H(f) grows rapidly with the dimensions Lk and the number of vector spaces r. For
our case of interest, which is H(Aijk(⟨p⟩)), we have r = L1 = L2 = L3 = 3. This hyperdeterminant
is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 36 in the entries Aijk ≡Aijk
m pm. It is a very large expression.
In fact, until the work [43], the hyperdeterminant of a general 3 × 3 × 3 tensor was not known
explicitly. The approach of [43] is to use that fact that the hyperdeterminant of a 3 × 3 × 3 array,
with entries Aijk, is necessarily a polynomial in invariants of SL(3, C) × SL(3, C) × SL(3, C) ⋊S3.
There are three independent invariants, denoted I6, I9, and I12 with the subscript giving their
homogeneous degree in the Aijk. Note that each is defined up to an overall scale, and I12 is defined
up to adding multiples of I2
6. In [44] these invariants were explicitly calculated, and we proceed
with their choice of scale and definition of I12. Then the result of [43] is
H(Aijk) = I3
6I2
9 −I2
6I2
12 + 36I6I2
9I12 + 108I4
9 −32I3
12.
(2.33)
As a polynomial in Aijk, I6 has 1152 terms. I9 has 9216 terms. I12 has 209061 terms. This prevents
us from straightforwardly investigating the general expression of the hyperdeterminant with regard
to our phase analysis. After imposing the Z3 symmetry Aijk = Ajki = Akij, required for gauge
invariance of our superpotential (2.10), the number of terms in each invariant decreases. Now I6
has 187 terms, I9 has 680, and I12 has 4933.
The hyperdeterminant expression remains too large to work with directly in full generality. We
proceed to experiment, repeatedly giving random values to the entries Aijk consistent with the Z3
symmetry. We observe that every time we do this, the explicit hyperdeterminant factorises. We
find in this way that
H(Aijk
m pm|Aijk
m =Ajki
m =Akij
m ) = Q8(p1, p2, p3)3 Q12(p1, p2, p3).
(2.34)
That is, we observe that the hyperdeterminant of the coupling tensor for the cubic interactions in
the hybrid phase factorises into the cube of a single degree 8 homogeneous polynomial and a single
degree 12 homogeneous polynomial. In each such random case, we observe that the hypersurface
Q8 = 0 in P2 has 4 nodal singularities (that is, Q8 and dQ8 vanish but the Hessian matrix is
nonsingular). The hypersurface Q12 = 0 in P2 has 45 singular points, of which 21 are nodes.
Due to the non-regularity of the theory, is is unlikely that this is the whole story.
