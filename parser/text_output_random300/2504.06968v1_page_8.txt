Methods
Fermi data analysis. The GBM consists of 12 sodium iodides (NaI) detectors (8 keV−1 MeV)
and two bismuth germanate (BGO) detectors (20 keV−40 MeV)25, which has three different data
types: continuous time (CTIME), continuous spectroscopy (CSPEC) and time-tagged event (TTE).
The CTIME data include eight energy channels and have a finer time resolution of 64 ms. The
CSPEC data include 128 energy channels, with a time resolution of 1.024 s. The TTE data consits
of individual detector events, each tagged with arrival time, energy (128 channels), and detector
number25. We download the GBM data of GRB 221023A from the public science support center
at the official Fermi Website https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/
gbm/triggers/2022/bn221023862/.
We extracted spectrum by using the TTE data from the brightest (with the smallest angle
between this detector and the source object) two NaI detectors (n0, n1) and one BGO detectors
(b0). The light curves were extracted using the GBM Data Tools49. The spectral analysis of the
Fermi-GBM data was performed using the Bayesian approach package, namely the Multi-Mission
Maximum Likelihood Framework (3ML)50. We selected the GBM spectrum over 8 −900 keV
and 0.3 −30 MeV for NaI detectors and BGO detector, respectively. In order to avoid the iodine
K-edge at 33.17 keV 25, we ignore the data for the 30 −40 keV energy ranges . The background
spectrum from the GBM data was extracted from the CSPEC data with two time intervals before
and after the prompt emission phase and modeled with a polynomial function of order 0 −4
(Selected background time intervals: -130 −-10 s, 100 −200 s). We have used the Bayesian fitting
method for the spectral fitting, and the sampler is set to the dynesty-nested. And we accounted for
intercalibration constant factors among NaI and BGO detectors.
Spectral fitting. Figure 1 presents the light curves for GRB 221023A at different energy band.
We subdivided the light curve into five intervals labeled A (0 −5 s), B (5 −8 s), C (8 −30 s), D
(30 −36 s) and E (36 −60 s), respectively, which were separated by red dashed vertical lines. We
fit the corresponding spectra using the empirical Band function4, formulated as follows:

where K is the normalization of Band spectrum, α and β are the low and high-energy photon
spectral indices, respectively. E is the observational photon energy, and Ep is the peak energy of
the νFν spectrum. The maximum values of the marginalized posterior probability densities and
the corresponding 1σ uncertainties for each parameter of the Band model in each time interval are
presented in Table 1.
