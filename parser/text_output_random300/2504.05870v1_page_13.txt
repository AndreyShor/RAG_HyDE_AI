Appendix A – Effective Energy Functional\Boundary terms
We can construct the energy functional of this theory to further understand energy contributions
of the boundary terms,we take the energy functional to be

where we have replaced h τ = ∆θ + 2πqmΓ for the total twist such that, across Γ, ∆θ ≡

2. The twist τ is continuous on
R2 \ Γ. On the other hand, ∆θ and mΓ may have discontinuities elsewhere, however these do not
affect the functional derivative with respect to Γ (see below).
The functional derivative with respect to the line defect position is then

The original force equation is recovered along with boundary terms that account for changes in
length for a perturbed curve with different endpoints. In finite domains where defect lines intersect
the boundary, the boundary term dictates the defect is perpendicular to the boundary for stability.
