is passed through the sensor using LTT24 (precision measuring 
device for data acquisition from Labortechnik Tasler GmbH) to serve 
as a modulation signal. In the second step, an external in-plane 
rotating magnetic field is generated by two nested pairs of Helmholtz 
coils [Podaru 2015]. The two coil pairs are arranged perpendicular to 
each other (as shown in Fig. 2) and are fed with a sinusoidal signal 
that generates a magnetic field of equal amplitude. To achieve this, 
the output of a two-channel function generator AFG3102 by 
Tektronixwas adjusted to give the corresponding current to both coils. 
The current was measured using the Tektronix TCP312A current 
probe measurement system. The reference magnetic field generated  
by nested Helmholtz coils were calibrated using Fluxgate sensor 
(model: "Magnetomat 1.782") by "Institut Dr. Foerster GmbH & Co. 
KG".  Figure 3(a) shows the magnetic field created by both coils 
resulting in the change of the angle of the magnetic field shown in Fig. 
3(b). In the next step, the sensor output voltage is recorded with the 
24-bit ADC LTT24 data acquisition system at 100 ksamples/s. After 
recording, the sensor output is demodulated using a Lomb-Scargle 
periodogram, returning the magnetic field measurement of the sensor 
(see Fig.3(c)) [Ratajczack 2020]. The reference magnetic field is also 
recorded with the LTT24 device. Figure 3(d) exhibits the angular 
dependence of the output polarity of the sensor. Finally, the sensitivity 
of the sensor is calculated by dividing the amplitude of the sensor 
output (Vy) by the measured amplitude of the applied magnetic field 
(Bext) and can additionally be mapped along the angle of the magnetic 
field. For all measurements, 𝑆𝑦 is determined at 1 mA. The 
mathematical expression for the sensor sensitivity can be expressed 
as follows: 
𝑆𝑦= 
∆𝑉𝑦 (𝐵,𝑇)
∆𝐵𝑒𝑥𝑡       (3) 
where ∆𝑉𝑦 is the extrapolated peak voltage related with maximum 
voltage, and ∆𝐵𝑒𝑥𝑡 is the field interval from zero to maximum peak 
voltage field. Note that the applied magnetic field is eventually 
proportional to the total system anisotropy [Grosz 2016, Lim 2022]. 
Note that, for a m-ring PHMR sensor, the sensor sensitivity is the 
individual sum of each ring structure.  In exchange bias structures, 
magnetic anisotropy is induced due to the exchange coupling field, 
𝐻𝑒𝑥 and the induced anisotropy field, 𝐻𝑎. Thus, total local field 
anisotropy is expressed as [Jeon 2021 and Sinha 2012],  
𝛥𝐻𝑒𝑥𝑡= √

3 (𝐻𝑒𝑥(𝑇) + 𝐻𝑎(𝑇))     (4) 
The sensor noise measurements were carried out in a non-
shielded environment using conventional AC modulation technique 
without any magnetic shielding. By exciting the sensor with an 
alternating current, its output signal and intrinsic 1/f noise are 
transferred to frequencies at which the 1/f noise of the preamplifier 
and the electronic system noise can be neglected. In order to perform 
these measurements a Tensormeter Model RTM 2 (HZDR Innovation 
GmbH) with an inbuilt preamplifier (down to 2.4 nV/√Hz) and the 
output data is recorded using an ADC of the same system in a 
differential mode. The sensor biasing was carried out with a low-noise 
Tensormeter current source and an optimized current amplitude was  
set to 1 mA. The measured signal is modulated at 1025 Hz at a 1 Hz 
resolution bandwidth (BW). The noise measurements are performed  
in a 100 Hz measurement bandwidth. The noise measurements are 
performed in a 100 Hz measurement bandwidth. In this study a 0.005 
s integration time per demodulation is used. The sampling rate of the 
data acquisition system is chosen high above the Nyquist-Shannon 
sampling limit. All of the measurements were carried out in dc 
coupling mode in order to capture all frequency responses. In order to 
reduce the environmental noise, and other electromagnetic 
interferences (EMI), the sensor is placed in close proximity to the 
Tensormeter.  
 
 
 
C. Noise of PHMR sensors 
          The total electronic noise (𝑒𝛴) of PHMR sensors has four major 
components such as low frequency 1 𝑓
⁄  noise (𝑒1 𝑓
⁄
2 ), thermal or 
Johnson noise ( 𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙
2
), preamplifier noise ( 𝑒𝑎𝑚𝑝
2
)  and 
environmental noise, which can be expressed as, 
𝑒𝛴= √𝑒1 𝑓
⁄
2
+ 𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙
2
+ 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑥
2
+ 𝑒𝑎𝑚𝑝
2
+ 𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑣

         (5) 
The sensor 1 𝑓
⁄
noise which is intrinsic in nature is generally 
attributed to fluctuations in material properties and scattering 
mechanisms within the sensor's ferromagnetic layer. For PHMR 
sensors, it can be expressed mathematically as [Qiu 2018, Grosz 
2016], 
𝑒1 𝑓
⁄
2
=
𝛿𝐻𝑉𝐵
2
𝑁⋅𝑣𝑜𝑙⋅𝑓𝛽                      (6) 
Here, 𝛿𝐻: Hooge’s parameter, VB: bias voltage, N: total carrier 
number, vol: sensing volume, f: frequency, and β is close to1. As we 
can see from eq. (6), it is possible to minimize 1 𝑓
⁄  noise by employing 
suitable mitigation strategies such as optimization of bias current, 
increasing the sensing volume, etc.  
Thermal noise, also known as Johnson-Nyquist noise, is an inherent 
noise source present in all conductive materials due to thermal motion 
of charge carriers. The spectral density of thermal noise is white,
