trace is equal to 1, which is consistent with the definition
of the density matrix for a spin coherent state, since it
represents a pure state.
We performed numerical simulations considering a ly-
otropic liquid crystal system immersed in a strong static
magnetic field, B0. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and
cesium pentadecafluorooctanoate (CS-PFO) were chosen
to represent quadrupolar nuclei with spins I = 3/2 and
I = 7/2, respectively. We considered the quadrupolar
Hamiltonian from Eq.(2) evolving under relaxation dy-
namics with the fluctuations also driven by the quadrupo-
lar Hamiltonian. In other words, relaxation occurs be-
cause of fluctuations in the electric field gradient around
the quadrupolar nucleus. The time intervals τk chosen
to simulate relaxation dynamics were multiples of the in-
verse of the quadrupolar frequency, 2π/ωQ = ν−1
Q , with
τk ∈[k −1, k] ν−1

and k = 1, 11, 21, · · · , 1001.
The Wigner quasi-probability distribution in a gener-
alized phase space of angular momentum was applied as a
visual geometrical tool to elucidate the squeezing gener-
ation, and its disappear during the relaxation evolution.
The quantum dynamics of the spin system was decoded
from the density matrix evolved at time values τk, where
k = 1, 21, 41, 71, 91, and 1001, is presented. In both spin
systems, the spin coherent state is squeezed in the yz
plane, as shown in Figs.1(a)-(b). Figs.1(c)-(d) show the
behavior of the squeezing parameter and angle during the
relaxation dynamics for the I = 3/2 spin system. For the
I = 7/2 case, these dynamics are shown in Figs.1(e)-(f).
In both cases, two minima are observed in the squeezing
parameter throughout the full evolution.
To generate
the Wigner quasi-probability distributions, the first min-
imum was selected because it corresponds to the instant
of maximum state squeezing. These minima are particu-
larly significant because they indicate the instants of the
time when the squeezing is most pronounced.

The Heisenberg uncertainty relation [38] is the most
appropriate formal expression to characterize whether
there is any correlation between a pair of quantum oper-
ators. This remarkable result led to the introduction of
extensions in the quantum approach such that in 1929,

As shown in Figs.1(a)-(b), the spin coherent state

Within this framework, the
