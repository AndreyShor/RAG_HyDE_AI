Comparison between residue specific-coefficients and experimental 
solvation scales 
 
We performed a Pearson correlation analysis among the residue-specific parameters 
fitted using the VBS3322 dataset (see Methods section) to assess their consistency 
across different methods. Additionally, we included solvation and hydrophobicity 
scale values in the correlation comparison to evaluate their relationship with the fitted 
parameters. As shown in Fig. 3, the amino acid-specific parameters (a1 to a20) exhibit 
strong correlations across the potential-like methods. Furthermore, these fitted 
parameters show a notable correlation with Kyte and Doolittle hydrophobicity scale 
and an even stronger correlation with the experimentally-derived Rose scale, which 
was specifically designed to predict the average change in solvent accessible 
surface area of amino acids upon folding. 
In agreement with these observations, we then computed a new MBC based on the 
Rose scale, referred to as MBC(Rose). This correction was derived using a two-
parameter linear combination between the original-method delta and the Rose-scale 
delta (see Eq. 8), with results summarized in Fig. 2. The performance of MBC(Rose) 
is consistent with, or in some cases superior to, that obtained by the MBC(dd) 
approach. 
As a further validation, we computed the Pythia/MBC(dd) and Pythia/MBC(Rose) 
scores using the parameters derived from our VBS3322 training set and tested them 
on the independent mega-scale dataset29, which was not used in the parameter 
derivation. The results show an improvement (PCC: +0.07) over the original Pythia 
score, achieving a PCC close to 0.70 and an RMSE of 1.43 kcal/mol.
