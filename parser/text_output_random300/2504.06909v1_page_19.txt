results in decreased OLR changes, until it vanishes around 15◦and even becomes negative when
lapse rate effects dominate between 15◦and 20◦. Between 20◦and 40◦, the two effects revert
(Fig. 9): the lapse rate changes decrease until they become negative around 30◦and poleward, and
the atmosphere progressively becomes moister than the control run (Fig. 8), resulting in higher
