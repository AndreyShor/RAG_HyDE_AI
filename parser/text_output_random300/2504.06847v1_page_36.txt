Fig. 8. FTIR (compiled from nujol and fluorolube mulls) and Raman spectra of 2-AmpHSO4 
(phase I) crystals. The Raman spectra were recorded using laser excitation of 1064 nm (3900-
200 cm-1 region) and 780 nm (200-50 cm-1 region).  
 
Fig. 9. Micro-FTIR (ATR) and micro-Raman spectra of 2-AmpHSO4 (phase II) crystals. The 
Raman spectrum was recorded using 780 nm laser excitation. 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 10. Comparison of micro-Raman and micro-FTIR (ATR) spectra of 2-AmpHSO4 
polymorphs. Spectra (a) and (b) depict 2-AmpHSO4 phase II and I, respectively. The Raman 
spectra were recorded using 780 nm laser excitation.
