Quad1-X (-0.647), Quad1-Y (-0.547), Steer1-Y (-0.706),
and QH-control (0.336) as the most sensitive elements to
beam rate. By focusing on these key elements, we can
enhance optimization efficiency by reducing unnecessary
variables, ultimately simplifying the troubleshooting pro-
cess.
A 3D plot in Fig. 5(b) visualizes the aforementioned
key variables versus beam rate, showing trends where
high-intensity regions occur with specific parameter com-
binations.
Optimal ranges include (-15 – -25 V) for
(Quad1-X, Steer1-Y) and (30 – 45 V), (45 – 65 V) for
(Quad1-Y, QH-control).
In this analysis, Steer1-Y is
normalized to Quad1-X, and QH-control is normalized
to Quad1-Y to bring these variables onto a compara-
ble scale, facilitating clearer identification of relationships
and trends. Concentration blobs in these regions result

Live optimization of radioactive ion transport in
beamline Section 1. In the top panel, the activity in counts
per second (cps) is shown as a function of the optimization
iteration. A yellow star marks the maximum, which corre-
sponds to the optimum configuration. The background from
beta decay is shown in light blue. The bottom panel shows
variable changes corresponding to the top panel activity. Each
iteration took about 10 seconds.
from proportionality differences.
Simultaneous adjust-
ments in the same direction for (Quad1-X, Quad1-Y)
and (Steer1-Y, Quad1-Y) maintain favorable conditions,
while inverse adjustments are needed for (Quad1-X, QH-
control) and (Steer1-Y, QH-control). These results not
only provide a comprehensive understanding of the op-
timization process but also pave the way for enhanced
control strategies in RIB operations, potentially leading
to more efficient and precise experimental setups. This
advancement underscores the impactful potential of our
approach in optimizing complex systems, including but
not limited to RIB applications, marking a significant
step forward in the field.
The process described above for beamline Section 1
was applied in sequence through Section 5. While our
AI-assisted RIB transport optimization achieved similar
transmission efficiency (≈50%) and transport time (≈
