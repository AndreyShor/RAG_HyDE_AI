The HL-LHC likelihood for Higgs pair production
In this appendix we describe our implementation of the ATLAS+CMS combined likelihood for Higgs pair production
at the HL-LHC for L = 3 ab−1, based on the latest projections prepared in the context of the ESPPU26 [2]. For
the systematic uncertainties, we work in the so-called scenario S3, described in [41, 44], which extends the previously
used scenario S2 [1] by considering the 5% improvement in b-jet tagging and hadronic τ reconstruction efficiencies
which have already been achieved at Run 3. As compared to the previous (2019) ESPPU projections [1], the main
improvements in the ESPPU26 ones are those associated to the higher efficiency of the flavoured-jet tagging algorithms
used for b-jet reconstruction.
Our likelihood for Higgs pair production at the HL-LHC is constructed by combining the projected measurement
of the di-Higgs signal strength in ATLAS in S3, δµhh =+28%
−25% at the 68% C.L. [41], with the differential information in
the b¯bγγ [43] and the b¯bτ +τ −[42] final states also from ATLAS. While CMS does not provide an explicit projection
for µhh in [44], their expected significance for hh production is 4.5σ in S3, which is the same as ATLAS [41], and hence
it is justified to assume the same value of δµhh for CMS as for ATLAS. Concerning the differential measurements,
as demonstrated in [41, 44], the overall sensitivity to Higgs pair production at the HL-LHC is dominated by the
contribution from the two final states considered, b¯bγγ and b¯bτ +τ −. As well known, the inclusion of differential
information is necessary to eliminate a second spurious solution in the quadratic EFT fit [49, 50].
The ATLAS
b¯bγγ [43] and b¯bτ +τ −[42] analysis are provided in two bins of invariant mass, one with mhh > 350 GeV, which
dominates the SM signal strength, and the other one with mhh < 350 GeV, which targets BSM applications.

FIG. 5: The log-likelihood ∆χ2(κ3) = −2∆ln L(κ3) as a function of the Higgs self-coupling modifier κ3 for Higgs
pair-production at the HL-LHC corresponding to L = 3 ab−1. Here all SMEFT coefficients other than cφ are set to
zero. We display the likelihoods for the differential analyses of hh →b¯bγγ and hh →b¯bτ +τ −, for the inclusive signal
strength µhh, and for their combination. The horizontal dashed line indicates the ∆χ2 = 1 boundary.
Fig. 5 displays the resulting log-likelihood χ2(κλ) = −2 ln L(κλ) as a function of the Higgs self-coupling modifier κλ
for Higgs pair-production at the HL-LHC. In this likelihood scan, only cφ is varied and all other SMEFT coefficients
are set to zero. We show the likelihoods for the differential analyses of hh →b¯bγγ and hh →b¯bτ +τ −and for the
inclusive signal strength µhh, in all cases corresponding to an integrated luminosity of L = 3 ab−1 (hence, adding up
to a total of L = 6 ab−1 as corresponding to the ATLAS+CMS combination). The likelihood scan of µhh displays the
