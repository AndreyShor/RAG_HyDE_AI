Non Nucleonic Components in Short Nuclear Distances

function (see e.g. Refs.[8–12]). In our approach the relativistic effects are accounted for similar to
the one used in QCD (see e.g. [13, 14]) for calculation of quark distribution in hadrons, in which
light-front (LF) description of the scattering process allows to suppress vacuum fluctuations that
overshadow the composite structure of the hadron. Here one needs to identify the process in which
the deuteron structure is probed. For this we consider high 𝑄2 electrodisintegration process:
𝑒+ 𝑑→𝑒′ + 𝑝+ 𝑛,
(1)
in which one of the nucleons are struck by the incoming probe and the spectator nucleon is probed
with momenta comparable to the nucleon mass. If one can neglect (or remove) the effects related to
final state interactions of two outgoing nucleons, then the above reaction at high 𝑄2, measures the
probability of observing proton and neutron in the deuteron with large relative momenta. In such a
formulation the deuteron is not a composite system consisting of a proton and neutron, but it is a
composite pseudo - vector (𝐽= 1, 𝑃= +) “particle" from which one extracts a proton and neutron.
Thus we formulate the question not as how to describe relativistic motion of proton and neutron in
the deuteron, but how such a proton and neutron are produced at such extreme conditions relating
it to the dynamical structure of the LF deuteron wave function. In such formulation the latter may
include internal elastic 𝑝𝑛→𝑝𝑛as well as inelastic ΔΔ →𝑝𝑛, 𝑁∗𝑁→𝑝𝑛or 𝑁𝑐𝑁𝑐→𝑝𝑛
transitions. Here, Δ and 𝑁∗denote Δ-isobar and 𝑁∗resonances, while 𝑁𝑐is a color octet baryonic
state contributing to the hidden-color component in the deuteron.
The framework for calculation of reaction (1) in the relativistic domain is the LF approach[7] in
which one introduces the LF deuteron wave function:

𝑝𝑑+ , (𝑖= 1, 2) are LF momentum fractions of proton and neutron, outgoing from the
deuteron with 𝛼1+𝛼2 = 2 and in the second part we absorbed the propagator into the vertex function
and used crossing symmetry. Here 𝑢(𝑝, 𝜆)’s are the LF bi-spinors of the proton and neutron and 𝜖𝑖, 𝑗
is the two dimensional Levi-Civita tensor, with 𝑖, 𝑗= ±1 nucleon helicity. Since the deuteron is a
pseudo-vector “particle", due to 𝛾5 in Eq.(2), the vertex Γ𝜇
𝑑is a four-vector which we can construct
in a general form that explicitly satisfies time reversal, parity and charge conjugate symmetries.
Noticing that at the 𝑑→𝑝𝑛vertex on the light-front the "-" (𝑝−= 𝐸−𝑝𝑧) components of the
four-momenta of the particles are not conserved, in addition to the four-momenta of two nucleons,
