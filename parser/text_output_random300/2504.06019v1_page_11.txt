we can then calculate the pCAPE of the environment, which we use as a scale for
the kinetic energy in the model, so that [U] ∼√pCAPE. Assuming that bp ≥be for
LFC ≤z ≤LNB, we take the (CAPE) length scale to be [L] = LNB −LFC, which
determines the buoyancy ([B] ∼[U]2/[L]) and timescale ([t] ∼[U]/[L]) for the system.
Note that for the environment shown in Figure 1, we set LNB = H, i.e. the domain
height. The scales associated with this non-dimensionalisation are:
[U] =

pCAPE,
[B] =

LNB −LFC,
[L] = LNB−LFC,
[t] = LNB −LFC
√pCAPE .

Additionally, we set the pressure scale to be [Φ] = [U]2 = pCAPE. The non-
dimensional momentum equation is then given by,

is the “Rainy” number, which is a moist version of the Rayleigh number.
The Rainy number represents the ratio of the destabilising effect of conditional
instability (quantified by CAPE) to the stabilising effect of diffusion in the model, and
therefore more faithfully corresponds to the role of Rayleigh number in dry classical
Rayleigh-B´enard convection. Figure 2 shows the critical “classical” Rayleigh number,
the critical moist Bretherton Rayleigh number, and the critical Rainy number across
the climate change parameter space, as calculated by a linear stability analysis.
Note that the linear stability analysis is discussed in detail in Section 4. The Rainy
number varies much less than the “classical” (dry) critical Rayleigh number over
the parameter space, as a result of including a measure of moist instability in the
definition of the Rainy number. Additionally, the Rainy number varies less than
the moist ‘Bretherton’ Rayleigh number across the parameter space as a result of
choosing CAPE (instead of bp(H) −bE(H)) to quantify conditional instability. The
results in Figure 2 therefore show that Ry is more useful than Rad and Ram in
categorising the behaviour of the moist conditionally unstable system. We need to
know the basic state to be able to compute CAPE and hence Ry, however calculating
CAPE is routine in meteorology and climate studies.
We derive a radiative Rainy number in Appendix B, based on the surface flux
of moist static energy, which is an alternative measure of conditional instability in the
system. By quantifying the surface flux of m, the radiative Rainy number becomes
relevant for climate studies focused on the response of moist convection to different
surface fluxes. The CAPE based Rainy number given by equation (27) can be used to
understand the water cycle intensification under climate change (observed previously
in Kendon et al. (2019)).
