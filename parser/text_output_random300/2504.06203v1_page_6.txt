and compatible with the idempotent fusion rule (II.28), nat-
urally in terms of the relative Deligne tensor product over C
[82, 83],
M ⊠C M ∼= nM ,
(III.4)
where n ∈Z+ is the fusion multiplicity. The physical mean-
ing of n is better understood in the case of topological fusion
as capturing an emergent 1d TQFT, but it is somewhat myste-
rious in the non-topological fusion considered here. One way
to connect the two (and give a physical definition of n in the
present case) is by considering a bulk C-symmetric RG flow
to a gapped phase. Note that the symmetry category C itself
has a canonical C-bimodule category structure and is known
as the canonical (trivial) C-bimodule category because it’s the
identity with respect to the relative tensor product. In particu-
lar it trivially solves (III.4) with n = 1 as expected because it
labels the trivial (transparent) defect.
The indecomposable C-symmetric TQFTs, describing Tgap
above, are in one-to-one correspondence with indecompos-
able C-module categories Mgap [80, 84]. The simple objects
of Mgap are precisely the Cardy branes |ν⟩. In fact, Mgap is
a (C, Cdual)-bimodule category where Cdual is the dual sym-
metry under a generalized gauging in C [80, 84]. Naively, one
may expect that the defect C-bimodule category M is given
by the relative tensor product of Mgap and its orientation re-
versal Mgap over Cdual,
Mgap ⊠Cdual Mgap ∼= C ,
(III.5)
which gives the trivial bimodule category C, shared by the triv-
ial defect as mentioned above [82]. However in general, M is
given by a quotient of C, realized by a surjective C-bimodule
functor C →M, reflecting the fact that some topological de-
fects in C may be absorbed by the defect,
Li ◦D = D ◦Li = D .
(III.6)
Finally, so far we have focused on the symmetries that com-
mute with the defect as in (III.1). There are further constraints
from the broken symmetries (knowing exactly how the sym-
metry is broken). For example, when the symmetry defect L
anti-commutes with O, one can infer the following fusion rule
between the pinning defects (with opposite signs of h) and L,
L ◦D±(O) = D∓(O) ◦L .
(III.7)
which further implies that the IR g-function is independent of
the sign of the pinning flow [11]. In the special case of in-
vertible L, namely its orientation reversal L defines the fusion
inverse,
L ◦L = 1 ,
(III.8)
one conclude that
D±(O) = L ◦D∓(O) ◦L .

EXAMPLES
In this section, we combine the factorization property and
symmetry constraints to solve the IR behavior of generalized
pinning defects (I.1) in 2d and 3d CFTs.
A.
Pinning Flows in 2d Virasoro minimal model CFT
While boundary conditions of Virasoro minimal model
CFTs are well-known and in one-to-one correspondence with
scalar primaries, much less is known about conformal defects.
In general that would involve analyzing boundary conditions
for the doubled theory T ×T from folding the minimal model
T at the defect line. The resulting theory has conformal cen-
tral charge c > 1 and the boundary conditions are not classi-
fied with the exception for the Ising CFT [85]. Nonetheless,
with the general results presented here, we will have definite
predictions for the IR behaviors of generalized pinning defects
in T .
As a warm up, let us consider the Ising CFT, in which case
the only operator of dimension ∆< 1, which could be a can-
didate for defining a pinning flow, is the spin operator σ of
dimension ∆= 1
8. This operator breaks all the symmetries
in the Ising CFT and produces a trivially gapped phase when
turned on in the bulk. Consequently, we conclude that the
IR defect takes the form of (III.2) with a single factorization
channel D(σ) = |B⟩⟨B|, into a fixed boundary condition |B⟩
for the Ising CFT. Furthermore g-theorem requires the cor-
responding boundary to have g-function gB < 1, for which
the only possibilities are the Dirichlet boundaries |±⟩with
g± =
1
√
2. This fixes uniquely the conformal pinning defect
in the Ising CFT to be
D±(σ) = |±⟩⟨±| ,
(IV.1)
depending on the sign of the pinning field h. As a consistency
check, since the operator σ is odd under the Z2 global sym-
metry, the two flows in (IV.1) must be related by conjugation
(III.9) with the symmetry defect η,
D+(σ) = η ◦D−(σ) ◦η ,
(IV.2)
which is indeed satisfied since η|±⟩= |∓⟩under defect-
boundary fusion.
As a more interesting application, we now consider the tri-
critical Ising CFT which contains three operators of dimen-
sion ∆< 1: ϵ 1
10 , 1
10 , σ 3
80 , 3
80 and σ′
7
16 , 7
16 . The global symme-
tries of the theory is described by,
C = Ising ⊠Fib , Irr(Ising) = {1, η, N} , Irr(Fib) = {1, W} ,
(IV.3)
where N is the duality defect with quantum dimension ⟨N⟩=
√
2 and W is the nontrivial Fibonacci symmetry defect with
⟨W⟩=
√
5+1
2
and they satisfy the topological fusion rules,
N ◦N = 1 ⊕η , N ◦η = η ◦N = N , W ◦W = 1 ⊕W .
(IV.4)
The tricritical Ising CFT has 6 indecomposable boundary con-
ditions and they are related by fusion with the topological de-
fects as follows
|+⟩, |−⟩= η|+⟩, |0⟩= N|+⟩,
|d⟩= W|0⟩, |0−⟩= W|+⟩, | + 0⟩= η|0−⟩.
