the ghost ﬁeld in the adjoint representation and gives rise to the ghost-antighost kinetic
term and the ghost-antighost interaction with the gauge boson,
Lghost = −c∂DAc = −ca∂µ(∂µδab −gεabcGcµ)cb.

The terms with the auxiliary Nakanishi-Lautrup ﬁeld Ba make up the gauge ﬁxing part,

They allow us to express in a succinct and useful form the deﬁning symmetry relations

propagate in loops. Their statistics, dimension and transformation properties (cf. Tab. 1)

The antighost ca and the Ba-ﬁeld form a BRST doublet and the sterile left-handed
fermion as well as the external ﬁelds have vanishing BRST transformations. All other
BRST transformations are non-linear in the dynamical ﬁelds.
