Abstract
This work explores structured matrix sequences arising in mean-field quantum spin systems. We express
these sequences within the framework of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) ∗-algebras, leveraging the
fact that each GLT matrix sequence has a unique GLT symbol. This symbol characterizes both the
asymptotic singular value distribution and, for Hermitian or quasi-Hermitian sequences, the asymptotic
spectral distribution. Specifically, we analyze two cases of real symmetric matrix sequences stemming
from mean-field quantum spin systems and determine their associated distributions using GLT the-
ory. Our study concludes with visualizations and numerical tests that validate the theoretical findings,
followed by a discussion of open problems and future directions.
Keywords: mean-field quantum spin systems, reduced models, GLT matrix-sequences, spectral distri-
bution, zero-distributed matrix-sequences, localization of eigenvalues, extremal eigenvalues, momentary
GLT symbols.

Introduction
In recent years, the field of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) sequences has experienced significant ad-
vancements, driven by their growing applicability in numerical analysis and applied sciences via highly
performing computational algorithms; see [25, 26, 27] for the seminal papers and see [5, 6, 7, 14, 14] for the
systematic treatment of the theory. These developments have not only broadened the theoretical foundation
