FIG. 3. Total DR cross section for Te2+ recombining into Te+
is plotted against the relative electron energy.
recombining into Te+, calculated with a resolution width
of 100 meV. In the DR spectrum, a small resonance is
observed at low energies, below 0.5 eV, attributed to the
5s25p2 3PJ states (where J = 0, 1, 2). At approximately
14.5 eV, two prominent resonance structures appear, cor-
responding to the 5p5d 3DJ (where J = 1, 2, 3) and 3PJ
(where J = 0, 1, 2) states, with the 3D1 and 3P1 states
being the dominant contributors. Additionally, several
significant resonance peaks are observed on either side
of this strong resonance feature, arising from the 5s5p3
states.
Given the presence of a well-defined resonance near the
threshold and strong DR resonance features at higher en-
ergies, along with a relatively high DR signal strength,
this ion is a promising candidate for further DR spec-
troscopy studies, both experimentally and theoretically.
Figure 4 presents the total dielectronic recombination
(DR) cross sections for the recombination of Ce2+ into
Ce+, calculated with a resolution width of 100 meV. A
strong DR resonance is observed near the threshold, pri-
marily due to the convolution of the 4f 2 and 4f 5d states.
At energies close to 0 eV, the 4f 2 3H5 state is the domi-
nant contributor, whereas toward the tail end of the peak,
the 4f 5d 1G4 state becomes the most significant. Al-
though the spectrum appears to decline beyond 0.2 eV,
the cross-section magnitude remains on the order of 107
barns, emphasizing the strength of this prominent reso-
nance feature. This suggests that Ce2+ could serve as a
strong candidate for experimental study near the thresh-
old energy, similar to Y+. Furthermore, the exceptionally
high DR signal might indicate a considerable probability
of its detection in a kilonova.
The findings of Gu [43] suggest that the energy values
computed using the FAC may have uncertainties due to
factors such as incomplete treatment of correlations or
limitations in the atomic model. Furthermore, according

FIG. 5. Rate-coefficient for Y+, Sr+, Te2+, and Ce2+ is plot-
ted against the electron temperature.
to the FAC manual authored by Gu [46], in the case of
near-neutral ions (as in the present case), the uncertain-
ties associated with radiative decay rates and autoioniza-
tion rates can reach 20% or, in certain instances, exceed
this value. Additionally, limiting the number of states n
introduces an uncertainty of approximately 10%. There-
fore, the overall minimum uncertainty in the present cal-
culation of DR cross section and strengths is estimated
to be around 30%. Given the substantial amount of data
generated in this work, all data are made available as
supplementary material.
Figure 5 illustrates the dependence of the total DR rate
coefficients on electron temperature, calculated by incor-
porating Rydberg states with principal quantum num-
bers ranging from n = 6 to n = 35, except for Ce2+.
