Properties of E and E(n).
To begin with, we recall some properties of E. Let us first look at the (s, h) where E is supported on.
Support of E.
The structure of the support of E is easily understood: for h â‰¥0 (h < 0 is symmetric because
E(s, âˆ’h) = E(s, h)), we have
E(s, h) = 0 if and only if Q(sâ€², h|hâ€²) = 0âˆ€sâ€² â‰¥s, hâ€² âˆˆ[âˆ’1, 1],
that is
E(s, h) = 0 if and only if

that is if and only if s â‰¥

Therefore
Support of E =

(s, h) : h âˆˆ[âˆ’1, 1], 0 â‰¤s â‰¤

,
(B.2.1)
and in particular E(s, h) > 0âˆ€h âˆˆ[âˆ’1, 1], 0 â‰¤s < 1. Moreover we have the following asymptotic estimate.
Figure B.2.1: The support of E is defined by the curve {s â‰¥1, s =
1
1âˆ’|h|} âˆª{s = 0, h âˆˆ[âˆ’1, 1]} âˆª{s â‰¥0, h = Â±1}.
Lemma B.2 ([15]). There exists a constant C > 0 such that
E(s, h) â‰¤
C
s + 11sâ‰¤

1âˆ’|h| ,
âˆ€s âˆˆ[0, +âˆž), h âˆˆ[âˆ’1, 1].
The previous Lemma can be obtained by direct computations on Q. The main consequence of this Lemma is that,
as a function of s, the support of E is compact for any h âˆˆ(âˆ’1, 1) (not for h = Â±1) and that, for fixed s, E is non
zero only in an interval (in h) whose amplitude is 2
s.
Moreover by [6, 15] we have
