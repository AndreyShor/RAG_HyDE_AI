Proof. We begin by observing that the quantity |Gλ
(7.32) −Gλ
(7.31)| is bounded above by a multiple of

(7.34)
Recalling the definition (7.1), we have that
Fλ
b,x−L(Υu+x
b
) ≤|Dλ
b,0(Υu+x
b
)|−1 .
By using the above estimate, we proceed to bound (7.33) and (7.34) separately. Starting from (7.33),
using Lemma 4.27, we obtain that
(7.33) ≲b−1
2
Z A+L
0
e
√
2d(x−L)(b1/4 + x)dx ,
and the quantity on the right-hand side can be made arbitrarily small by taking b ≥0 sufficiently large.
Regarding (7.34), thanks to Lemma 4.28, we obtain that
(7.34) ≲
Z A+L
0

2d(x−L)
Z ∞

2πb
(u + x)(bd2 + (u/b)2d)dudx ,
and, as before, the quantity on the right-hand side can be made arbitrarily small by taking b ≥0
sufficiently large. Hence, the claim follows.
Thanks to the previous lemma, from now on, we can focus on Gλ
(7.32) instead of Gλ
(7.31). We now
address the fact that the quantity Fλ
b,x−L(Υu+x
b
) is not a priori bounded. The approach to overcoming
this issue is quite straightforward. Specifically, recalling (7.9), we show that replacing Fλ
b,x−L(Υu+x
b
)
in Gλ
(7.32) with Fλ
b,x−L,L(Υu+x
b
) introduces only a negligible error, provided that L is sufficiently large.
More precisely, we consider

(7.35)
and we claim the following result.
Lemma 7.12. For any λ > 0, ε > 0 and A ≥0, there exist L ≥0 sufficiently large, and b ≥0
sufficiently large such that
|Gλ
(7.35) −Gλ
(7.32)| ≤ε .
Proof. We start by addressing the fact that the integral over x from 0 to A + L in Gλ
(7.32) can be
reduced, up to a negligible error, to an integral from L/2 to A + L. To this end, for x ∈[0, A + L]
and u ∈[b1/4, b3/4], we recall that thanks to Lemma 4.22, it holds that
E0,u,b
h
Fλ
b,x−L(Υu+x

b
)≤λ}

(7.36)
Using the above bound, one can easily see that the difference between Gλ
(7.32) and the same quantity
with the integral over x from 0 to A + L replaced by the integral over x from L/2 to A + L can be
made arbitrarily small by taking L ≥0 sufficiently large uniformly over all b ≥0.
