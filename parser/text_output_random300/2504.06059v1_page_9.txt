FIG. 7: Block sorting network. Each blue box is a
sorting network that sorts a block of labels. Green
boxes are universal interferometers.
they rely on other encodings (for instance polarization).
Using our framework we can design sorting networks
that combine several smaller interferometers. To per-
form universal computations we propose to sort the la-
bels by blocks. An example is given in Fig. 7 with 8
modes and blocks of 2 modes. Each blue interferometer
on 4 modes creates two sorted blocks of labels. The ar-
rangement of the blue interferometers follows a sorting
network on 4 modes. Ultimately we need to sort the
labels within each block with universal interferometers
in green.
With
an
m-mode
computation
and
k
blocks
of size p (assuming m
=
kp),
the network has
k(k −1)/2 interferometers on 2p modes arranged as an
interferometer-circuit of depth k and k interferometers
on p modes counting as an interferometer-circuit of
depth 1.
Any 2p-mode universal interferometer can be used to
sort the block of labels. This gives a global circuit with
k(k −1)

2p(2p −1)

+ k p(p −1)

MZIs and an MZI-depth of
k × 2p + p = 2m + p.

FIG. 8: Diamond design on 6 modes for block sorting
the labels.
Note that the depth and the number of components
have doubled compared to the standard scheme.
To improve the number of components, we use smaller
interferometers to sort the blocks of labels. We want
to separate the labels into two blocks: the ones with
lowest values and the ones with highest values. This is
illustrated in Fig 7 by the wire labels. The labels within
a block do not need sorting until the very end. We can
use the diamond design shown in Fig 8 for 6 modes to
do this partial sorting.
One can see this design as a
sequence of diagonal layers, each one moving one label
from the lower block to the upper one. This new 2p-
mode interferometer has p2 MZIs and depth 2p−1. The
total number of MZIs required for universality becomes
k(k −1)
2
p2 + k p(p −1)

= m(m −1)

which is optimal. The MZI-depth is now

2 −1
p

m + p
which is not asymptotically optimal unless p = 1.
