FIG. 5. We plot the holonomy visualization of the three torsion fields (35), (36), and (37). Left to right: scan over three torsion
example configurations (35)–(37); first row: spacetime case (ϵ = +1), second row: spatial case (ϵ = −1). For 9 × 9 sample
points in each diagram, we plot the corresponding autoparallel visualization.
This set of three autoparallel Killing vectors, according to
a theorem by Peterson and Bonder [13], is also maximal
in two dimensions, since in n spacetime dimensions there
is a maximum of n(n + 1)/2 autoparallel Killing vectors.
Their norms are given by
A · A = −ϵ ,
B · B = 1 ,
C · C = (−1)

In the limit of vanishing torsion we find that
lim
τ,χ→0 Aµ = eAµ ,
lim
τ,χ→0 Bµ = eBµ ,
(59)
whereas the limit of Cµ is singular. However, note that
the three vectors Aµ, Bµ, and Cµ satisfy a deformed (but
closed) Poincar´e algebra,
[A, B]T = 0 ,
[A, C]T = ϵ e¯sB ,
[B, C]T = e¯sA .
(60)
which motivates the identification Cµ ↔eCµ in the case
of non-vanishing torsion. This is a central result of this
paper, and we emphasize that the normalization of the
vector C is chosen such that the right-hand side of this
algebra smoothly connects to the Poincar´e algebra of flat
spacetime.
We moreover note that when utilizing the
ordinary commutator [•, •], the algebra of A, B, and C
would not close. Moreover, computing again the genera-
tors for the three autoparallel Killing vectors, we find
∇µAν = 0 ,
∇µBν = 0 ,
∇µCν = e¯s

η = e¯s eη ,

where eη is a free parameter, and the above corresponds
to a spacetime-dependent Lorentz boost of rapidity e¯sη0
(for ϵ = +1) and to a space-dependent rotation of an-
gle e¯sη0 in the case of ϵ = −1. In the limiting case of
vanishing torsion, this generator matrix again reduces to
the boost generator (or rotation generator) known from
the torsionless case above. This further underscores the
interpretation of Cµ as the torsionful generalization of
the boost Killing vector.
However, a striking property of the flat spacetime
boost Killing vector is its ability to achieve zero norm,
which Cµ does not attain: depending on the sign of τ0
