Acknowledgments 
This project is supported by Schmidt Sciences, LLC. This research is also supported in part through 
the NYU and WHOI High Performance Computing resources. We acknowledge the World 
Climate Research Programme’s Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which led the design of 
CMIP6 and coordinated the work, and we also thank individual climate modeling groups (listed in 
Table S1) for their efforts in performing all model simulations analyzed here. We also would like 
to thank Lijing Cheng, Masayoshi Ishii, Jonathan Gregory, and Quran Wu for their efforts in 
producing and maintaining the observational datasets utilized in this work.
