This is just Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion resolved in the direction normal to the curve
R = c, for small negative c.
Here we recall more generally,
v = ˙Xt = (∇S −A + ∇R)(Xt), t ≥0, Xt=0 = x ∈R2.
So that for our WIMPish particles P, with −→

We can now expand R(r0 +(r−r0), θ) as a Taylor series, giving from the above identity:
