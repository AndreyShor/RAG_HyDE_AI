Proof. Using (2.3), we write
βX,Y (ξ1
i ⊠ηk) = ηk ⊠ξ1
i =
X
j
ηk ⊠ξ2
j t∗
ij.
Then the eﬀect of the A-module homomorphism βY,X becomes
X

ξ2
j ⊠ηkt∗
ij.
Then using (2.2), we get the right hand side of (2.4).

3. Distinguished algebra objects
3.1. Lagrangian algebra in the Drinfeld center. Let C be a unitary fusion category, and let
us denote the set of its irreducible classes by Irr(C). Given i ∈Irr(C), we denote its representative
by Ui. We also write 0 for the class of monoidal unit, so that we have U0 = 1C.
We denote the (unitary) Drinfeld center of C by Z(C) (for example, see [M¨ug03a]). Its objects
are pairs (Z, c), consisting of an object Z ∈C together with a half braiding, that is, a natural
unitary isomorphism
cX : Z ⊗X →X ⊗Z
(X ∈C).
that fulﬁlls the hexagon axiom. Morphisms in Z(C) are morphisms in C between the underlying
objects that commute with the respective half braidings. The monoidal product of C induces
a monoidal structure on Z(C) where the half braiding of a product Z ⊗Z′ is given by the
composition of the respective half braidings. Moreover, Z(C) is naturally unitarily braided with
braiding
(3.1)
β(Z,c),(Z′,c′) = cZ′ : Z ⊗Z′ →Z′ ⊗Z.
for objects (Z, c) and (Z′, c′) in Z(C).
Recall that there is a distinguished object (Zreg, creg) in Z(C), given by
(3.2)
Zreg =
M
i∈Irr(C)
U ∗
i ⊗Ui.
Let us recall the unitary half-braiding creg, cf. [NY16, Section 3.2]. Given X ∈C and indexes i
and j for Irr(C), we take a family of morphisms vij
α : Ui ⊗X →Uj such that P
α vij∗
α vij
α is the
orthogonal projection onto the j-th isotypic summand of Ui ⊗X. Then we deﬁne
cX,ij : U ∗
i ⊗Ui ⊗X →X ⊗X∗⊗U ∗
i ⊗Ui ⊗X →X ⊗U ∗
j ⊗Uj
by setting
cX,ij =
s
di
dj
X
α
(idX ⊗vij∗∨
α
⊗vij
α )( ¯RX ⊗idU∗
i ⊗Ui⊗X),
where di is the categorical dimension of Ui, and vij∗∨
α
: X∗⊗U ∗
i →U ∗
j is the morphism we obtain
by composing vij∗
α
with the standard solutions of conjugate equations for X, Ui, and Uj. If we
collect cX,ij as a morphism Zreg ⊗X →X ⊗Zreg, it is unitary, and satisﬁes the consistency
conditions for half-braiding.
We can detect the triviality of the M¨uger center of Z(C) by testing it against (Zreg, creg), as
follows.
Proposition 3.1. Let (Z, c) be an object of Z(C) such that βZreg,ZβZ,Zreg = idZ⊗Zreg. Then we
have Z ≃1⊕k
C
for some integer k.
Proof. The morphism β−1
Z,Zreg = c−1
Zreg respects the direct sum decomposition (3.2). In particular,
for the direct summand U0 = 1C, we get the identity morphism of Z. On the other hand, if we
look at βZreg,Z = creg
Z
out of the summand U ∗
0 ⊗U0, we end up in the summands Z ⊗U ∗
j ⊗Uj
for all Uj contained in Z. From βZreg,Z = β−1
Z,Zreg, we get the claim.
