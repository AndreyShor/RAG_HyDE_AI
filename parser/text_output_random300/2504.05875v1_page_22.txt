Figure 7:
Fractional energy density of PBH as a function of the number of efolds from the end of
inflation. The black curves show the numerical computation of (B.1), whereas the green and red curves the
analytical approximation of (B.6) and (B.11), respectively. The peak of the power spectrum is centered at
kpeak = 10−2kend.
The integral of (B.4) is now straightforward and gives

This occurs after the Gaussian peak has fully entered the horizon, when the production of
PBH decreases drastically. The approximation (B.6) is shown in Fig. 7 in red as a function
of the number of efolds from the end of inflation. It shows a good agreement with the
numerical solution for small Apeak. However, as Apeak increases, a small portion of the
Gaussian peak exceeds σk ≃1 and for those modes β(k) ̸= A1σ5

fraction reaches a constant value

(σk ≃1).

Still, this approximation is only valid for the portion of the peak above the threshold value
σth = 1. Imposing σk > σth in (B.2), the following range of k is obtained
