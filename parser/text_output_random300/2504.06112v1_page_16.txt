defectors in ΥPDG and ΥSDG at equilibrium is shown in Fig. 8(a) – Fig. 8(e). These results
demonstrate that as µ increases, cooperative clusters (represented by red and orange tiles)
continue to expand. Notably, when µ = 1.0, cooperative clusters nearly span the entire sys-
tem, leading to a near-complete dominance of cooperation. From this analysis, it is evident
that the social coupling parameter µ, induced by the adaptive control mechanism, not only
promotes cooperation within ΥPDG and ΥSDG, but also facilitates the formation of cooper-
ative clusters. Moreover, increasing µ reduces the initial disadvantage faced by cooperators,
shortens the time required for cooperation to reach its maximum level, and accelerates the
stabilization of cooperation within the system.
Now, Fig. 7(f) – Fig. 7(j) depict the fraction of cooperators and defectors across the entire
system, as well as within ΥPDG and ΥSDG, as a function of MCS for different values of the
sucker’s payoff σ. From these results, it is evident that as σ increases, the proportion of co-
operators steadily rises, while the fraction of defectors declines throughout the evolutionary
process. Moreover, the fraction of cooperators in ΥSDG consistently exceeds that in both the
overall system and ΥPDG. The spatial arrangement of strategies in ΥPDG and ΥSDG at equi-
librium for different values of σ (σ = 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0) is shown in Fig. 8(f) – Fig. 8(j).
These results indicate that when σ is small, cooperators remain scattered throughout the
system, making them more vulnerable to defector exploitation. However, as σ increases,
cooperators progressively dominate the system, forming increasingly large cooperative clus-
ters. Thus, we conclude that higher values of σ promote cooperation within the multi-game
framework by facilitating the formation of large cooperative clusters, which in turn enhance
resistance against defectors.
To gain a deeper understanding of how the coupling parameter µ influences the evolu-
tion of strategies in the different games, we analyze the average fitness of cooperators and
defectors across the entire system, as well as within ΥPDG and ΥSDG, as a function of MCS
for different values of µ. The results are presented in Table I. It is evident that regardless
of the value of µ, the average fitness of cooperators at each MCS is consistently higher than
that of defectors. Notably, the average fitness of cooperators in ΥPDG is the lowest among
all groups. Additionally, when µ = 0, players are not influenced by their social environment,
leading to the lowest average fitness across all game-based and strategy-based subpopula-
tions. However, as µ increases, the average fitness of all players rises significantly. These
findings demonstrate that the advantageous environment mechanism, enabled through the
