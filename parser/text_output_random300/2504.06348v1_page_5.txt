Figure 1: The algorithm consists of three main steps: Initial state preparation of a physically relevant
quantum state of pseudoions and electrons, followed by time-evolution until a desired final time, and finally
information extraction which includes the identification of chemical species present in the wavefunction.
We define a compact description of the chemicallyâ€“relevant degrees of freedom - pseudoions and electrons -
and propose a flexible initial state construction by considering the important physical motions - molecular
translations, rotations, vibrations, and electronics. Our time evolution procedure involves the construction
of an efficient block-encoding of a Hamiltonian describing interacting pseudoions and electrons. Finally, we
develop a new method to identify chemical species by using classical computational methods to develop
chemical fingerprints that are efficient to implement coherently on a quantum computer.
