Abstract
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has long been a fundamental
research direction in the field of computer vision. Previous studies
have primarily relied on traditional RGB cameras to achieve high-
performance activity recognition. However, the challenging factors in
real-world scenarios, such as insufficient lighting and rapid movements,
inevitably degrade the performance of RGB cameras. To address
these challenges, biologically inspired event cameras offer a promising
solution to overcome the limitations of traditional RGB cameras. In
this work, we rethink human activity recognition by combining the
