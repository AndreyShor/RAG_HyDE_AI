Fig. 1. (a) Example of grown crystals of 2-AmpH2PO3. (b) Typical morphology of the grown 
crystals of 2-AmpH2PO3, shown in (a) and used in the present work, with indicated 
crystallographic axes and face indices. Note that in the point group 2 of 2-AmpH2PO3 crystals 
of opposite handedness also occur, in (c) their typical morphology is given.
