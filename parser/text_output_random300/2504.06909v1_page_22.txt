Fig. 10. Total response and the different components of the alternative decomposition of TOA radiative
anomalies using relative humidity, computed using radiative kernels, between the 𝐹0 = 0 and 𝐹0 = 4 m.s−1.day−1
experiments. Panel a corresponds to the interactive-SST runs, panel b to the fixed-SST runs, and panel c is
the difference between the two. Numerical values given in the legend correspond to the global average of the
associated component.
