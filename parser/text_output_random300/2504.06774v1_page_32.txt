ing to significant deviations and loss of critical flow features. However, the LSTM 2 dense
and the time-distributed SVD model show improved stability, capturing the overall flow
dynamics better than the 1 dense architectures. The HOSVD-based LSTM 2 dense ar-
chitecture performs the best in this scenario, underscoring the advantages of HOSVD in
providing a more faithful representation of the flow field. The spanwise velocity results
highlight the complexities of accurately capturing the intricate flow physics in regions of
near-zero velocities.
The RRMSE values for the 3D cylinder case are summarized in Tables 11, 12, and 13.
Across all LSTM architectures, HOSVD consistently outperforms SVD, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture the underlying flow dynamics with reduced error. Notably,
for the spanwise components where HOSVD maintains a significant advantage over SVD
by over 8%. Error values are particularly higher for the spanwise velocity component,
where the predominance of very low and near zero velocities in most of the domain
