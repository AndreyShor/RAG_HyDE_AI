states ρ⊗M
i=0,1. In this work we will mostly use the clas-
sical Chernoff information between probability distribu-
tions defined as the result of photon-counting measure-
ments, motivated by the choice of comparing the quan-
tum and classical performance in realistic remote sensing
at optical frequencies, as discussed in the introduction.
However, the formalism can be trivially extended to use
ξQ rather than ξ.
Alice’s target sensing task, in the general case, can be
expressed as an m−hypoteses test.
For a given probe
state ρ0, Alice will measure the returning state ρA and
define hypothesis H(A)
j
, with
H(A)
j
: ρA
?= ρj,
j = 1, ..., m,
(4)
where ρj = Ej,κ,µB(ρ0) is one of the possible returning
signals after the interaction with the target.
The re-
turning state depends on the hypothesis index j, on the
reflectance κ of the target and on the total number of
background photons µB.
After probing the target with M copies (bandwidth),
where Alice sends ρ⊗M
0
and receives ρ⊗M
j
, in the asymp-
totic regime, M ≫1, the probability p(A)
err that Alice
guesses the wrong hypothesis decays exponentially as
p(A)
err ≃e−Mξ(A), where the multi-hypothesis decay rate
ξ(A) (both quantum and classical) is found in terms of
that of the closest hypotheses in the set [36, 37]:
ξ(A) = min
i,l

ξ(H(A)

, H(A)

On the other side, Eve faces a target detection task
with no control on the states and the bandwidth, which
are chosen by Alice. This binary problem is defined by
the hypotheses:
H(E)
0
: ρ
?= ρB,
H(E)
1
: ρ
?= Ej,1−κ,µB(ρ0),
(6)
where ρ is the state being measured. In hypothesis H(E)
0
Eve receives a background state ρB, while in hypothe-
sis H(E)
1
she receives the scattered input probe from Al-
ice. Note that H(E)
1
is independent on the index j. Eve’
best performance will be then characterized by the rate:
ξ(E) := ξ(H(E)
0
, H(E)
1
).

Chernoff Information Bottleneck
Having defined the Chernoff information for the tasks
performed by both parties, Alice and Eve, we can define
the covert information, IC, as the quantity:
IC(d, S) := max
ξ(E)≤d ξ(A),
(7)
where the maximization is over the probe states ρ0 ∈S,
under the constraint that Eve’s Chernoff information is
limited by d. In other words, by formalizing the covert
target detection problem as the maximization in Eq.(7),
we implicitly define a bottleneck on the related Chernoff
information of Alice and Eve. Different values of IC(d, S)
are possible depending on the chosen set of probe states.
The problem (7) defines a constrained optimization
and its solution by KKT conditions [38] can by found
from the saddle points of the Lagrangian LC:
LC := ξ(A) −βξ(E),
(8)
with β ≥0.
In the Lagrangian formulation, the op-
timization is still with respect to the probe states in
a given subset S, but the dependence on the con-
straint d is lost.
Nonetheless, from the stationary
points of the Lagrangian one obtains the optimal β-
dependent rates ξ(A/E)
∗
(β) and can plot the parametric
curve (ξ(E)
∗
(β), ξ(A)(β)). Such curve is monotonically in-
creasing as a higher ξ(E) allows a higher rate ξ(A). There-
fore, there exists a single value of β, that we call βd, such
that ξ(E)
∗
(βd) = d. The optimal rate achievable by Alice
under the constraint (7) is then IC = ξ(A)
∗
(βd).
Our choice of IC in Eq. (7) is motivated by the op-
erational meaning of the Chernoff information as the
exponential decay rate of the probability of error, in
the asymptotic limit of M ≫1 of transmission repe-
titions/modes, perr ∼exp(−ξM).
Let us fix the total
number of photons sent to the target during sensing to
µT = µM, where µ is the mean number of photons of
each transmission. Setting the parameter d in Eq.(7) to
be d ≪1/M, imposes the condition ξ(E)M ≪1, mean-
ing that exp(−ξ(E)M) approaches 1. In other words, we
may insure covertness, namely p(E)
err
→1/2 where Eve
is close to a random guess, in the asymptotic regime by
imposing a condition dependent on the band (M). This
argument outlines how the available band is an impor-
tant resource in covert sensing tasks as well as the total
number of photons.
It is often complex to explicitly compute the covert
information (7) for the most general class of probe states,
namely when S is the full Hilbert space.
Therefore, we may fix the class of probe states that Al-
ice can send, e.g. squeezed states or coherent states, and
compute the resulting Chernoff informations ξ(A) and
ξ(E). We will mostly focus on two possible choices, the
“classical” set SC of coherent states and the “quantum”
set SQ of entangled signal and idler states. We will claim
quantum advantage whenever IC(d, SQ) > IC(d, SC) for
the same d, namely whenever ξ(A) is strictly larger with
entangled inputs than with coherent states, despite not
exceeding the constraint ξ(E) ≤d. However, such advan-
tage is not necessarily useful. To quantify the usefulness,
we also define the effective Chernoff information as
∆ξ := ξ(A) −ξ(E).
(9)
We now claim that any ∆ξ > 0 is necessary for “effec-
tive” covert sensing, as it means that Alice can recover
information at a greater rate than Eve.
