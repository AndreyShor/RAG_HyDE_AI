Continuously parameterized two-qubit gates are a key feature of state-of-the-art trapped-ion quan-
tum processors as they have favorable error scalings and show distinct improvements in circuit per-
formance over more restricted maximally entangling gatesets. In this work, we provide a comprehen-
sive and pedagogical discussion on how to practically implement these continuously parameterized
MÃ¸lmer-SÃ¸rensen gates on the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT), a
low-level trapped-ion processor. To generate the arbitrary entangling angles, Î¸, we simply scale the
amplitude of light used to generate the entanglement. However, doing so requires careful consid-
eration of amplifier saturation as well as the variable light shifts that result. As such, we describe
a method to calibrate and cancel the dominant fourth-order effects, followed by a dynamic vir-
tual phase advance during the gate to cancel any residual light shifts, and find a linear scaling
between Î¸ and the residual light shift. Once, we have considered and calibrated these effects, we
demonstrate performance improvement with decreasing Î¸. Finally, we describe nuances of hardware
control to transform the XX-type interaction of the arbitrary-angle MÃ¸lmer-SÃ¸rensen gate into a
phase-agnostic and crosstalk-mitigating ZZ interaction.

INTRODUCTION
Trapped-ion quantum computers have grown in size,
complexity,
and performance metrics over the past
decade, with flagship systems now exhibiting two-qubit
gate fidelities greater than 0.998 and register sizes in ex-
cess of 30 qubits [1, 2]. One of the workhorses of these
processors is the two-qubit entangling MÃ¸lmer-SÃ¸rensen
(MS) gate, proposed in 1999 [3, 4], and experimentally
demonstrated in 2003 [5]. It has now become the most
prevalent entangling operation available in many com-
mercial trapped-ion quantum processors [6â€“9] as well as
academic and national laboratory efforts [10â€“12].
The
two-qubit MS gate finds application in a wide array
of complex quantum algorithms for simulation and op-
timization protocols, but also has a potential role in
quantum networking applications [13], error correction
schemes [14], quantum metrology [15], and quantum ma-
chine learning [16].
While work has been done to im-
prove the effective implementation of this gate in experi-
ment [17â€“21], both stochastic and coherent errors still re-
main limitations to gate fidelity, and therefore it is vital
to understand how to best calibrate against error sources
that limit qubit coherence and gate operation times.
Here, we provide a pedagogical discussion of the cali-
bration of a two-qubit arbitrary-angle MS gate. In par-
ticular, we discuss pulse shaping and motional mode se-

lection, the approach used to generate arbitrary amounts
of entanglement, and the impact and mitigations for light
shifts that arise during the interaction. The MS gate is
based on a transverse Ising-type interaction, where the
unitary for the gate may be written:
UMS(Î¸, Ï•) = exp

âˆ’iÎ¸
2 (Ë†ÏƒÏ•,i âŠ—Ë†ÏƒÏ•,j)

(1)
where Î¸ is the rotation angle, i and j are ion-label indices,
and Ë†ÏƒÏ• = cos(Ï•)Ë†Ïƒx + sin(Ï•)Ë†Ïƒy is a rotation about the
equatorial Bloch-sphere axis defined by phase Ï•, where Ë†Ïƒx
and Ë†Ïƒy are the usual Pauli operators. The typical imple-
mentation of the gate is a maximally entangling Clifford
operation occurring at a Î¸ = Ï€
2 rotation, i.e. MS(Ï€/2).
In many noisy intermediate-scale quantum, or NISQ,
computing applications, generating arbitrary amounts
of entanglement is favorable as gate error tends to de-
crease with decreasing gate angle [1, 6]. These variable-
angle gates, MS(Î¸) where Î¸ âˆˆ[0, Ï€/2], are particu-
larly useful for decomposing arbitrary unitary operations
via Cartanâ€™s KAK decomposition [22]. This decomposi-
tion means any arbitrary two-qubit SU(4) unitary can
either be broken down into three MS(Ï€/2) or broken
into three MS(Î¸) [23â€“25]. Clear performance improve-
ments have been demonstrated when compiling circuits
via an arbitrary-angle entangling gateset rather than a
more limited gateset with only maximally entangling
gates [25].
