presented. Four jet event shapes have been studied at the NLOQCD level [430] and three jet
event shapes at NLOQCD with NLL resummation for hadronic Higgs decays are known [431,432].
A study of flavour-sensitive observables at NLOQCD for up to three jet hadronic Higgs decays
was presented in Ref. [433].
Many of the dominant QCD and EW corrections for the major Higgs boson decay modes
are available in the Prophecy4f [401, 402,434], HDECAY [435, 436] and Hto4L [437] programs,
which are widely used.

LH21 status: Results at NNLOHTL known for two decades [190,191,438–440]. Inclusive N3LOHTL
results computed in [441–443] and available exactly in the programs iHixs 2 [444] and in
an expansion around the Higgs production threshold in SusHi [445].
Differential results at
N3LOHTL were presented in Ref. [229,310,446–448] and the transverse momentum spectrum of
the Higgs boson has been studied at NNLO + N3LL’ [449–451] and at N3LOHTL + N3LL’ [230].
NNLO +NNLL predictions for gg →H(→γγ) are publicly available through Hturbo [452].
The mt-dependence is known at 3-loops for the virtual piece [404, 405, 453] and at 4-loops
in a large-mt expansion [454]. Complete NLOQCD corrections are known for arbitrary quark
masses [374, 455–461], while the top mass dependence is known at NNLOQCD [462]. The top-
quark mass renormalisation scheme uncertainty for offshell Higgs production has been studied at
the same order [463]. Bottom quark effects have been studied for intermediate Higgs transverse
momentum mb ≲pT ≲mt at NLO + NNLL [464]. Power-suppressed logarithms of the form
yqmqαn
s ln2n−1(mH
mq ), where yq is the Yukawa coupling, arise for small virtual quark masses in
gg →H. These have been resummed for next-to-leading power O(m2
q) corrections at NaLL ccu-
racy [465–468] for next-to-next-to-leading power at double-logarithmic accuracy [469]. Mixed
QCD–EW corrections, N(1,1)LO(HTL)
QCD⊗EW, are known in the limit of small electroweak gauge bo-
son mass [470, 471], and the dominant light-quark contribution to the NLO mixed QCD-EW
corrections have been computed including the exact EW-boson mass dependence [472].
Inclusive results to N3LOHTL are now available in the public program n3loxs [473]. In
Ref. [474], jet-veto resummation was implemented to NNLOQCD matched to N3LL’ in the public
code MCFM, and theoretical predictions at this order were compared with ATLAS and CMS
data. A substantial reduction of theoretical uncertainties relative to the NNLL accuracy was
observed.
There has been important recent progress on the impact of virtual quark masses. Inter-
ference effects between amplitudes with top and bottom loops were studied in Ref. [475] with
NNLOQCD accuracy, where the bottom and top quark masses are renormalized onshell. The
perturbative convergence is observed to be quite bad, with the O(α3
s) and O(α4
s) being almost
identical numerically.
Using the MS renormalization scheme for both the bottom mass and
the bottom Yukawa improves the convergence dramatically [476]. This reference also presents
comparisons between results computed using the 4FS and 5FS. The calculation of Ref. [462] was
matched to parton showers using the MiNNLOPS formalism in Ref. [477].
There has also been recent progress in advancing the precision of predictions for Higgs-
interference processes.
The interference between amplitudes for Higgs-mediated signal and
prompt background processes in the diboson decay channel (gg →H →V V and gg →V V ,
respectively) are known to be significant for offshell Higgs production, which comprises around
10% of the events in this channel [478], and can be used to place a stringent bound on the Higgs
width [479–481]. For many years, the computation of the exact NLOQCD corrections was ham-
