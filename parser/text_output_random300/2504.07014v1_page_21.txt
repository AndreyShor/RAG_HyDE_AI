which is just the equation for the FS with εF = µ(T = 0). For simplicity we will give the
results per one fermionic flavor (spin). Identifying the order parameter P with the volume
of the Fermi sea as
P = Ωdkd
F ∝µβ ,
(B9)
we have P ∝¯n, where
¯n =
Ωd
(2π)dkd
F
(B10)
is the average particle density and Ωd is the volume of d-dimensional unit ball. The response
is
χ◦= ∂¯n
∂µ = dΩd

Using the above results in the scaling relations
εF = µ ∝ξ−z

(B12)
ξI ≡1/kF ∝µ−ν′ ,
(B13)
χ◦
∝µ−γ ,
(B14)
we deduce the critical indices:
ν′ = 1
2 ,
z = 2 ,
β = dν′ ,
γ = 1 −dν′ .

The ground-state energy density E◦and the density of the grand canonical potential (which
is just negative pressure) are known [57]:
P = 3
2E◦∝kd+2

At zero temperature the critical index of the heat capacity α is usually identified from the
scaling of the ground state thermodynamic potential, see, e.g. [31, 37]
P ∝µ2−α −→α = 1 −dν′ .
(B17)
The above indices satisfy the hyperscaling relation 2 −α = (d + z)ν′ and the Fisher identity
(19).
The Lindhard function (B1) for d-dimensional non-relativistic fermions is known from
the literature. With the notation x ≡q/2kF the explicit formula for d = 3 [67]:
d = 3 :
L(x) = 1
2 + 1 −x2
4x
ln

1 −x
 .
(B18)
In two dimensions, see, e.g., [68]:
d = 2 :
L(x) =



1 , x < 1
1 −
q
1 −1
x2 , x > 1
(B19)
And for d = 1:
d = 1 :
L(x) = 1
2x ln
1 + x
1 −x
