COMPOSABLE SECURITY RATE WITH
TIGHT LEAKAGE BOUND
A.
Secret key length with composable terms
The secret-key length is upper-bounded by the follow-
ing expression (see also Ref. [9, Eq. (36)])
sǫcor+ǫh+ǫs
n
≤nR∞−√n∆ǫs
aep(h) + θ,
(1)
obtained assuming that the protocol did not abort, the
extracted key is correct, with probability larger than 1 −
ǫcor, and secret with probability larger than 1−ǫsec. The
ǫsec = ǫs + ǫh, where ǫs is the smoothing parameter and
ǫh is the probability of failure of Privacy Ampliﬁcation
(PA). The asymptotic key-rate R∞in Eq. (1) is given by
R∞= H(k) −χ(k : E) −n−1leakec.
(2)
The quantity ∆ǫs
aep, given by the expression
∆ǫs
aep(h) ≃4 log2
√
2hd + 2
 p
log2(2/ǫ2s),
(3)
accounts for the penalty due to ﬁnite-size eﬀects, while
θ = log2(2ǫ2
hǫcor)
(4)
is the penalty paid for non-ideal veriﬁcation and Privacy
Ampliﬁcation while n is the block size of the raw key
after channel parameter estimation (PE) and leakec is
the error correction (EC) leakage.
The quantity H(k), in Eq. (2), is the Shannon entropy
of the key variable k and χ(k : E) is Eve’s Holevo informa-
tion. The key variable k takes values from the alphabet
K = {0, 1, . . ., 2hd −1} for d-bit digitization of the nor-
malized quadrature results, according to refs. [9, 47, 48].
In this description, the dummy variable h = {1, 2} dis-
tinguishes between homodyne (h = 1) and heterodyne
detection (h = 2). More speciﬁcally, for heterodyne pro-
tocol, the digitized outcomes are in the vectorial form
(kq, kp), that can be concatenated as
k = kq2d + kp,
(5)
without loss of any information because the mapping
(kq, kp) ↔k is one-to-one, and with Shannon entropies
related by the following mathematical expression H(k) =
2H(k) (see Appendix
A for details). For error correc-
tion the parties may now decide to use the vectorial form
{k(1)
q , k(1)
p , k(2)
q , k(2)
p , . . . , k(n)
q
, k(n)
p }.
From here,
we apply the procedure given in [9,
Eq. (48)], to write Eq. (2) as
R∞= hH(k) −χ(x : E) −n−1leakec,
(6)
where variable x is the continuous-variable version of k.
Note that for the homodyne protocol k and k are equiv-
alent forms of the key variable. The steps to obtain the
Holevo bound for the RR protocol have been detailed in
Ref. [9], hence we give only the ﬁnal expression for the
CM for the DR protocol in Appendix B.
We can now calculate the secret-key rate after param-
eter estimation, replacing in the Holevo bound the chan-
nel parameters with their worse-case scenario values for
transmissivity τ ǫpe and excess noise ξǫpe, obtaining the
expression below
Rǫpe
∞= hH(k) −n−1leakec −χ(x : E)|τ ǫpe,ξǫpe ,
(7)
which can replace R∞in Eq. (1).
B.
Theoretical estimation of EC leakage
In case of one-way reconciliation, where low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes [51, 52] are used (see also
Sec. III), the EC leakage term can be upper-bounded by
the number of syndrome bits, given by
leakec ≤log2 |M|,
(8)
where M is the alphabet of the syndrome strings. One
may calculate the size of the alphabet |M| via EC simula-
tions, as done in Ref. [46] for asymptotic security analysis
and in Refs. [28, 47, 48] for composable security analysis.
However, in a complete theoretical analysis, one may
use the asymptotic bound (Slepian-Wolf coding [61])
stating that
log2 |M| −nhH(k|y) ≥0,
(9)
where H(k|y) is the conditional Shannon entropy of k
conditioned on the continuous variable y of the other
party.
In fact, when considering ﬁnite-size eﬀects one
can use a more rigorous bound [50] providing a tighter
estimate of the performance of information reconciliation.
Such a bound is given by
log2 |M| −nhH(k|y) −√n∆ǫec
leak(h)
 ≤δ(n),
(10)
where
∆ǫec
leak(h) =
p
hV (k|y)Φ−1(1 −ǫec)
(11)
with Φ being the cumulative normal distribution. The
right-hand side of Eq. (10) is given by
δ(n) = 1
2 log2 hn + O(1)
(12)
while the conditional entropy and the conditional entropy
variance are given by
H(k|y) = E [−log2 p(k|y)] , V (k|y) = Var [−log2 p(k|y)] .
(13)
We now extend the calculation of Eq. (10) to non-
binary alphabets (i.e., d > 1) using the expression of
