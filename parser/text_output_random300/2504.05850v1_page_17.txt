Figure 2. The asymptotic expansion of graphical functions at z = 0. Bold lines stand
for sets of edges.
The first two terms have pole order 3 < 2λ = 4. They are consistent with the theory of graphical functions.
Terms three and four are pure poles in z = 1 of orders 5 and 4, respectively. They are killed by subtraction.
The regular solution is given by the first two terms,

It is possible to derive a result for the general function (87) in any dimension D.
8.3. The log-divergent case. If, after appending an edge, the Feynman integral has a logarithmic
divergence, we cannot proceed as in Section 8.2.
One needs to subtract the divergence taking into
account the exact scaling behavior; an expansion in ϵ is not sufficient. From (6) we, e.g., obtain for a
pole of order D + 2aϵ in a scalar propagator,

An expansion in ϵ of the singular propagator gives

∥x −y∥D (1 −2aϵ log ∥x −y∥) + O(ϵ2).
The coefficient of the pole in ϵ depends on the constant a which determines the scaling behavior of the
singularity. In the expansion of the propagator the parameter a appears at order ϵ1 which may mix with
other terms ∼∥x −y∥−D log ∥x −y∥.
The solution to this problem is to extract the exact scaling behavior of the singularity in terms of
two-point functions as depicted in Figure 2 for a singularity at z = 0. The asymptotic expansions at
0, 1, and ∞only rely on scaling arguments. They lift to graphical functions with numerator structure.
The result is related to the momentum space method of expansion by regions (see [26] and the references
therein).
The mathematical statement (a well-tested conjecture) is as follows [18, 21]. Assume G is a graph
such that the graphical function f α
G(z) exists. Let Vint
G
and Vext
G
= {0, 1, z} be the sets of internal and
external vertices of G, respectively. For V ⊆Vint
G
let G[V ] be the subgraph of G which is induced by V ,
i.e. the subgraph which contains the vertices V and all edges of G with both vertices in V . Further, let
G[V = 0] be the contracted graph G/G[V ] where all vertices in V are identified with the vertex 0. Then,
we obtain the asymptotic expansions at z = 0 by

G(z) =
X
V ⊆Vint
G
f α
G[V ∪{0,z}](z)f α
G[V ∪{0,z}=0](1 + O(|z|))
whenever the right-hand side exists. Note that the right-hand side of (97) only has two-point graphs.
The situation at z = 1 is analogous,
(98)
f α
G(z) =
X
V ⊆Vint
f α
G[V ∪{1,z}](z)f α
G[V ∪{1,z}=1](1 + O(|z −1|)).
In case of a logarithmic singularity at infinity one has to subtract the asymptotic expansion
(99)
f α
G(z) =
X
V ⊆Vint
f α
G[V ∪{0,1}]f α
G[V ∪{0,1}=0](z)(1 + O(|z|−1)).
Subtraction of the asymptotic formulae eliminate logarithmic singularities. Appending the edge to the
subtractions (which are two-point functions) is a convolution that can be calculated analytically using
(6). Details are analogous to the scalar case which is explained in detail in [21].
