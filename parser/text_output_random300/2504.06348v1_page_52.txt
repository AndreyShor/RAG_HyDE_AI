Table 8: Rescaling factors per pair of electron-pseudoion with the first (second) column for the local (non-
local) terms. In each cell, the top number is the exact value and the bottom number in parenthesis is an
approximate bound computed as per the discussion in App. D. Note that the numbers technically vary for
a given problem instance but the differences in practice are often negligible (a few percent or less).
the leading rescaling cost arises from electron-electron Coulomb interactions. Finally, we reiterate that our
rescaling and overall costs are significantly lower than an all-electron block-encoding, due to the use of
pseudoions to reduce both particle number and basis size, and by a judicious choice of cutoffs.

Conclusion
In this work, we developed a general and practical end-to-end framework to simulate the real-time quantum
dynamics of chemical systems, including fully-interacting (beyond Born-Oppenheimer approximation) elec-
tronic and nuclear degrees of freedom, in first quantization with a plane wave basis. To achieve this, we first
introduced the notion of a pseudoion, which combines chemically inactive (core) electrons and the nucleus
into a single point-like ionic object with an effective charge, lifting the well-known 1−body pseudopotentials
from quantum chemistry literature to 2-body interaction terms. Second, we provide an initial state prepara-
tion protocol, taking into account physical accuracy and algorithmic costs, in order to efficiently and flexibly
initialize the quantum state across all motional degrees of freedom - molecular translations, rotations, vibra-
tions, and electronics. Third, to evolve the initial state in time, we construct an efficient block-encoding of
a Hamiltonian comprising interacting pseudoions and valence (chemically active) electrons, heavily utilizing
quantum rejection sampling methods [75]. Finally, we develop a new paradigm for information extraction via
Quantum Chemical Identification (QCI), wherein we classically develop and validate chemical fingerprints for
molecular identification based on a combination of physical intuition and machine-learning techniques, and
show how to implement the fingerprints coherently on the quantum computer utilizing amplitude estimation
for efficient readout. We stress that we make no physical approximations in our time-evolution besides the
use of a finite plane-wave basis and the general usage of pseudoions.29
The substantial methodological and technical effort to develop this general framework via a detailed
analysis of chemical physics, as well as construction and optimization of the quantum circuits involved, is
illustrated through quantum resource estimates for 3 classes (a total of 7 specific problem instances) of
problems. These involve both molecular/cluster systems and extended systems discussed in Sec. 2.4, with a
detailed cost analysis presented in Sec. 7. We find costs in the range 1011 −1014 Toffolis per femtosecond
of evolution, depending on the use-case (recall that the timescale for bond reconfiguration in chemistry
can range from femtoseconds to picoseconds).
To these, one needs to add a multiplicative overhead of
approximately the inverse square-root of the reaction yield (probability of desired chemical products) -
hence we stress the importance of porting classical biasing techniques to the quantum algorithm. These
resource estimates are encouraging, since they are not entirely different from those expected from energy
29Other spatially-localized or hybrid bases are certainly directions to consider in the future, although this might require
careful consideration as to how localized bases will evolve in time during the evolution.
