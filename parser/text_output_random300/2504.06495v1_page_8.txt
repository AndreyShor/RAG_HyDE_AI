(including the observer itself). Due to the deterministic nature of the Schr¨odinger equation,
if we know the state vector ψτ0 at any initial time τ0, the equation uniquely determines the
state vector’s value for all other times τ.
Despite this underlying deterministic dynamics, decoherence theory explains that from
the perspective of an observer inside the multiverse, the future is not unique. This is because
over time the state vector branches into many decoherent components. Assume that at time
τ0 the state vector ψτ0 describes one coherent (branch of the) universe which an internal
observer perceives as their state of the world at time τ0. Then, at time τ1 > τ0 such that
τ1 −τ0 is large enough, the state vector will have additively split into multiple components
ψb(τ1) as follows:
ψ(τ1) =
X
b∈B
ψb(τ1).

Here, B is a discrete set that labels the decoherent states. Each state ψb(τ1), b ∈B, cor-
responds to a distinct classical reality that could emerge through the decoherence process.
These branches are eﬀectively independent, with negligible quantum interference between
them, and each represents a diﬀerent possible outcome or “world” that an observer might ex-
perience. The observer, being part of the quantum system, will ﬁnd themselves in one of these
branches, unable to directly detect the existence of the other branches due to decoherence.
It is remarkable that these multiple distinct futures emerge naturally from the strictly
deterministic Schr¨odinger equation. This possibility was ﬁrst suggested by Everett (1957).
The physical mechanism of this branching was later explained through the decoherence pro-
gram, developed by Zeh (1970) and Zurek (1981), with important mathematical foundations
established in Joos and Zeh (1985).2
For our analysis, we build upon these established decoherence results. The key insight is
the wave function branching described by equation (1), where states ψb(τ1) represent distinct,
non-interfering universes emerging from a single initial state at time τ0. With elements of B
2The mechanism of decoherence explains how classical reality emerges from the quantum world through
the interaction between quantum systems and their environment. Rather than invoking collapse or external
measurements, decoherence theory shows how environmental interactions naturally select certain preferred
states — known as “pointer states” — that remain stable under further interaction.
