occur in samples annealed above 800 ◦C, with the bcc phase exhibiting increased Nb
and Ti concentrations.
Figure 19(a) shows the dependence of Tc on annealing temperature. The as-cast
sample undergoes a superconducting transition at Tc=8.11 K, which increases signiﬁ-
cantly to 9.36 K in the sample annealed at 600 ◦C before slightly decreasing at higher
annealing temperatures. Figures 19(b) and (c) summarize the annealing temperature
dependence of fundamental superconducting parameters. The values of µ0Hc2(0), the
magnetic penetration depth (λGL(0)), and ξGL(0) show no systematic dependence on
the annealing temperature. The temperature-dependent upper critical ﬁeld of each
sample is ﬁtted using the Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) model. In this ﬁt-
ting, the Maki parameters (αM) can be derived and are plotted as a function of
annealing temperature in Fig. 19(d). The αM values reach a maximum at 400 ◦C,
coinciding with the strongest lattice deviation. Moreover, the annealing temperature
dependence of αM aligns well with that of the lattice deviation. The Maki parameter
αM is expressed by
