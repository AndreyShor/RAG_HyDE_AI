We begin scrutinising the simpler case J2,1. The twist factor w is given by the non-integer part of the
powers of the rational factors present in the integral times the extra boundary term qρsρ. The four-forms can
in principle have any numerator and a denominator comprising integer powers of any of the rational factors
in the integral. We transform to the coordinates z, ¯z as before, upon which the r integration will linearise in
the last step. Calling the coordinate dependent rational factor
p9 = 1 −r −q r z ¯z + q r2 z ¯z + r s t −r s t z −r s t ¯z + r s t z ¯z

a good basis of forms turns out to be

The first master is J2,1 itself. The last two masters form a basis for the first step t, the last three a basis for
the second step s, and the last six for the third step q. Correspondingly, the connection Ωs is a 2 × 2 matrix,
Ωq is 3 × 3, and finally Ωr is 6 × 6. We provide the three connections and the four intersection matrices in the
ancillary files to this publication.
With nine elements the basis (61) is astonishingly short. The choice of elements deviates from our intuition
about scaling at infinity. Nonetheless, the leading and subleading orders of the expansions around poles are
sufficient. What is more, this choice of basis assures homogeneous Euler parameter dependence s2q2r2 of
Ct, then q2r2 of Cs, and finally r2 of Cq, while the top level matrix Cr obviously cannot contain any Euler
parameter.
As before, the coordinate dependence can be scaled out of these intersection matrices taking
denominators out of the master integrals. All four C matrices are provided in the ancillary files, too. A second
criterion that must be respected in choosing a basis is that the connections Ωs,q,r do not pick up higher poles
and are of pure dLog type, so there should not be a finite remainder once all simple poles are subtracted.
We have not systematically studied the origin of double poles arising from certain candidate masters. In
this problem we cannot employ masters with a denominator factor t. The effect might be related to the rather
special factorisation properties of p9, for instance it factors out s t at r →1. Yet, a denominator s is not a
problem, and t →0 or s →0 split a factor R off p9 without discriminating against that denominator either;
it occurs in master 2.
The Pfaffian matrices have very much the same features as for the one-loop box: rescaling γ →γϵ, δ →
δϵ, ρ →ρϵ, σ →σϵ they are linear in ϵ and the leading order equation implies that the masters are pure
functions with the denominators
d2,1 = {z −¯z, 1, 1, 1, 1, (1 −z)(1 −¯z), 1, 1, (1 −z)(1 −¯z)} .
(63)
The denominators are taken out by a transformation as in (45) on the Pfaffian matrices, upon which the latter
are linear in ϵ. Once again, we obtain canonical equations.
The Pfaffian matrices have the singularities {z, 1 −z, ¯z, 1 −¯z, z −¯z, 1 −z¯z, z + ¯z −z¯z} wrt. to the
coordinates. In this problem, an integration in terms of a fibration basis Ga[z] Gb[¯z] with the same alphabet as
for the one-loop box — so {0, 1, ¯z, 1/¯z, ¯z/(¯z −1)} in a and only {0, 1} in b — is not only convenient but even
necessary because four logarithm levels are needed due to the fourfold differentiation in formula (52). Due to
the proliferation of regulator parameters the higher orders of the solution become quite voluminous so that we
do not attempt to reproduce them here. Importantly, the limit ρ →0 is well-defined for master 1, ie. J2,1.
Two comments are in order: first, a Laurent expansion in terms of the regulator parameters is obtained:
upon re-instating σ →α+β the logarithm level four part of I2,1 (prior to differentiation) contains monomials
in α, β, γ, δ of total degree four, but also monomials of degree five in α, β, δ divided by γ. Second, naively
picking the α β γ δ component we obtain a fairly concise result with all desired features: it has u ↔v viz
z ↔1 −z, ¯z ↔1 −¯z antisymmetry as expected from the denominator z −¯z. The fact that the Laurent
expansion does not have a pole in δ — which will be a consequence of the fact that we first summed over
n4 — does not spoil this feature. Further, the symbol of the α β γ δ component contains only the letters
z, 1 −z, ¯z, 1 −¯z, z −¯z, whereas the two letters 1 −u, 1 −v do occur in components with γn, n > 1 or
δn, n > 1. The result for I2,1 in terms of Goncharov logarithms and its symbol are included in the ancillary
material.
