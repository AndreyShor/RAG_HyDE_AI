Figure 4: a),b),c),d) Absolute of nlo static part as a function of surface potential, distance from 
the surface, phase mismatch, and Debye length respectively. e)Variation of the absolute four-wave 
mixing signal due to the static part with the change of Ionic strength in the yellow-green curve. 
The Red curve shows the surface potential contribution and the blue part due to the phase factor. f)
