10−3, and the terms involving spatial gradient, |∇a| ∼
mavDMa, are generally suppressed, compared to those
involving the time derivative |∂ta| ∼maa, where we
adopt the natural units, and set the speed of light
to unity.
Then, the relevant modification appears
only through the effective current, given by Jeff =
−gaγ ∂t(a B). Further, the axions are predominantly
coherent, and exhibit an oscillatory behavior such that
a ∝e−i mat. This implies that when coupled with a
static magnetic field, the axion fields produce an al-
ternating current with a frequency of fa = ma/(2π) ≃
2.4 (ma/10−14 eV) Hz, which can serve as a source of
monochromatic EM waves at the same frequency fa
via the modified Amp´ere-Maxwell law. Assuming the
characteristic scale of R, its magnetic field amplitude
Ba is estimated roughly by equating the terms in the
Amp´ere-Maxwell law, ∇× B ∼Jeff.
This yields
|Ba| ∼gaγmaa0 R |B0|, with B0 and a0 being re-
spectively the amplitudes of static magnetic and axion
fields.
In the terrestrial environment, the geomagnetic field
serves as a representative static and global magnetic
field, characterized by a dipole configuration, with its
strength typically of |Bgeo| ∼25 −65 µT [24]. Setting
B0 to Bgeo and assuming that the size of magnetic
field is comparable to the Earth radius, RE = 6371 km,
we have

Here, ρDM is the local DM, which is related to the
quantity (maa)2/2 averaged over the timescales longer
than the coherence time Tcoh ∼2π/(mav2
DM). Since
the bandwidth of the produced EM waves is estimated
to be ∆f/fa ∼v2
DM ∼10−6, the induced EM fields
appear as a sharp frequency spike, persisting over the
coherence time.
Although the amplitude at Eq. (1) is more than
seven orders of magnitude smaller than that of the
geomagnetic fields, it is still detectable with high-
precision commercial magnetometers. Further, at f =
0.3 −30 Hz, the major background noise is a random
superposition of transient EM waves (e.g., [25, 26]),
which can be discriminated from the static axion sig-
nal having a sharp spectral line by using a long-term
monitoring data of terrestrial magnetic fields.
Let us compute the induced EM fields in more re-
alistic setup by properly accounting for the geometric
configuration of the Earth’s magnetic field and the at-
mospheric conductivity. The latter is crucial to obtain
a finite EM amplitude propagating near the Earth’s
surface especially at the frequencies of our interest,
where the resonant behavior is expected. We are inter-
ested in searching for the axion-induced signal through
the measurement of magnetic fields at the Earth’s sur-
face. Considering its non-uniform nature, the induced
magnetic fields are generally expanded with the vector
spherical harmonics, Φℓm ≡r × ∇Yℓm, where r is the
radial vector from the Earth’s center and Yℓm is the
scalar spherical harmonics. The signal satisfying the
divergence-free condition is expressed as [27, 28]
Ba(r, ˆΩ; ma) = gaγa

bℓ(ma r) Cℓm Φℓm(ˆΩ),

where the ˆΩ= (θ, ϕ) stands for the geographic coordi-
nate on the Earth surface, and the Cℓm is the harmonic
coefficient of the magnetic scalar potential V , which
describes the geomagnetic field through Bgeo = −∇V .
The function bℓis the radial mode function that char-
acterizes the response of the induced magnetic fields
to the axions at the radius r.
At the Earth’s sur-
face r = RE, its amplitude depends solely on the ax-
ion mass, ma. Introducing the dimensionless variable
x ≡mar, this is obtained by solving the following
equation with appropriate boundary conditions, and
taking only the homogeneous part of the solutions [27]:

Note that Eq. (3) is derived by using the wave equation
for the electric field alongside the Maxwell-Faraday
equation. Here, the influence of the atmospheric con-
ductivity is incorporated into the complex refractive
index n through n2 = 1+i (σ/ma), where the conduc-
tivity σ increases monotonically with the radial coor-
dinate r, from 10−14 to 10−3 S/m between the Earth’s
surface and the ionosphere (e.g., [29–31]).
Adopting the conductivity profile numerically tabu-
lated in Ref. [30]1, we solve the radial mode equation
by treating the radial dependence of σ or n as a sum of
spatially constant segments. This approach allows us
to analytically solve for bℓ, while satisfying the bound-
ary conditions at the Earth’s surface and above the
ionosphere [27]. The top panel of Figure 1 plots the
resultant mode functions for the lowest 6 multipoles
at the Earth’s surface, given as a function of ma or
the frequency fa of the induced EM signal. There is
a prominent peak structure in each multipole, known
as the Schumann resonance [34, 35] (see also Refs. [26,
36–38]), which is caused by EM waves trapped be-
tween the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere, forming
a resonant cavity. The peak frequencies are close to
p
ℓ(ℓ+ 1)/(2π RE) ≃7.46
p
ℓ(ℓ+ 1) Hz, as predicted
in the idealized case of a perfectly conducting Earth-
ionosphere cavity, although the actual peak positions
are systematically lower than these values by 20-30%
due to losses in the propagation of EM waves. As a

affected by the choice of conductivity profiles, e.g., [32, 33].
