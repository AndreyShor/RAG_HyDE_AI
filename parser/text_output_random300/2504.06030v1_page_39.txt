Classically from Hamilton’s equations X(s) = x(x0, p0, s), s being the time, P being
subject to the force field, −∇V (X), V being the potential energy in the simplest case,
so
d2
ds2X(s) = −∇V (X(s)),
s ∈(0, T),
where X(0) = x0 and ˙X(0) = p0; x0, p0 the initial position and momentum, respectively.
We assume that for some smooth function S0 : Rn →R, p0 = ∇S0(x0), then, as is well
known, the solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation,
∂S
∂t + 2−1|∇S|2 + V = 0,
(H-J)
S = S(x, t) with S(x, 0) = S0(x) is given by
S(x, t) = S0(x0(x, t)) +
t
Z
0
(2−1 ˙X
2
0 −V (X0(s)))ds,
where for s ∈(0, t), t ∈(0, T), X0(s) = x(x0, ∇S0(x0), s), x0(x, t) such that
x(x0, ∇S0(x0), t) = x for each x ∈Rn, x0(x, t) being assumed to be unique.
The
global inverse function theorem guarantees that if S0 and V are smooth and satisfy
appropriate boundedness conditions together with their derivatives, the map x = Dtx0
is such that Dt, for t ∈(0, T) is, for sufficiently small T, a diffeomorphism with D0 = id.
(See e.g. Ref. [11]).
It is easy to prove that for s ∈(0, t), for the above S(x, t),
˙X0(t) = ∇S(X0(t), t)
i.e.
dX0(t) = ∇S(X0(t), t)dt = b(X0(t), t)dt,
a dynamical system with b = ∇S. This gives a Burgers type fluid with velocity field,
b = v,
∂v
∂t + (v.∇)v = −∇V,
by taking the gradient of equation (H-J).
