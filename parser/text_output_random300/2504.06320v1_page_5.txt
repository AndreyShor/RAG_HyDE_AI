Fig. 3. Temporal Differential Conisitency loss term evolution over 40 Epochs
for 5 independent trainings.
In Fig. 3, we present the temporal differential loss term
across five independent training attempts over 40 epochs. The
plot shows a clear pattern of convergence and reproducibility,
indicating that the model consistently learns the underlying
temporal features of the data.
To further investigate the latent space learned by our autoen-
coder, we focus on a pair of deterministic latent nodes (nodes
1 and 4) and plot their values across 300 test samples. This test
set was not seen during training. To reduce visual noise, we
applied a moving average with a window size of 2. In Fig. 4a
the resulting traces of node 1 exhibit a clear periodic structure,
which aligns well with the known underlying periodicity in
the physical processes of the water distribution network. It
appears to capture an aggregate of multiple periodic signals of
varying frequencies and magnitudes, reflecting how different
system features contribute to the overall dynamic. Next, we
compare dynamic node 4 to the central difference of node
1 to assess whether node 4 effectively encodes the temporal
evolution of the state captured by node 1. As shown in
Fig. 4.
Example of a deterministic latent node pair (static/dynamic) on
300 samples from the BATADAL test dataset, including one attack phase
(highlighted in grey).
Fig. 4b, the alignment between the two signals is reason-
ably close but not perfect. We hypothesize that the observed
misalignment between the central difference of node 1 and
the trajectory of node 4 arises from two key challenges.
First, the comparison itself is inherently difficult due to the
challenges of numerically differentiating noisy signals is an ill-
posed problem. It requires smoothing and filtering techniques
[26]. In this case, an averaging window of 7 timesteps was
applied. Second, the complexity of the underlying system,
combined with its partial observability, raises fundamental
challenges in deriving an exact representation of the system’s
dynamics from the available measurements. In a previous
study [1], the theoretical conditions necessary to reconstruct
the system’s dynamics from measured values and the corre-
sponding dimensional requirements were examined. However,
when discrete measurement values, such as valve positions or
pump activation states, are introduced, it is no longer a trivial
consideration under which conditions an exact description
of the system’s dynamics can be formulated. Despite these
challenges, for the purposes of our use case, we don’t aim to
have an exact derivative. Node 4 gives an indication whether
the state captured by node 1 is increasing or decreasing,
providing an approximate causal link between the state and
its rate of change. Crucially, this approximate link consistently
breaks down during attack phases, as observed across all attack
scenarios in the BATADAL test dataset. On example can be
observed in detail in Fig. 4b. It is this disruption in the causal
link within the dynamic description of the system that we
leverage to enhance both the detection capability and the
response time of anomaly detection in complex operational
systems.
Next, we analyze the relationship between input features
and their latent space representations. For clarity, the scale
and y-offset of the latent nodes were adjusted to align with
