collapse and then higher σk does not mean a higher β(k). For instance, if a perturbation is
highly anisotropic, i.e. very elongated, different regions of the perturbation will experience
different gravitational forces and collapse at different rates. This leads to tidal shearing,
since the perturbation stretches and deforms rather than forming a compact object, and
to the formation of filaments or pancakes rather than PBH [21–25]. We numerically find
the following values of the constants: A1 = 0.056, A2 = 1.084, and A3 = 6.536. Eqn. (A.3)
offers, for the first time, a simple and rapid estimation of the mass fraction for the KP
formalism over the whole range of σk that avoids numerically-cost computations. This is
the mass fraction used in this work to compute the abundance of PBH.

where β(k) is given by (A.3) in terms of σk. To simplify, let us consider that the power
spectrum is given just by the Gaussian peak, that is, PR(k) ≃Ppeak

To gain some insight into the behavior of ΩPBH(k), we will solve analytically the integral
(B.1) in two regimes, small (σk ≲1) and large (σk ≳1) variance. First, let us consider
that the variance of the density perturbations is small for the whole range of k. In this
case, we can safely consider
β(k) ≃A1σ5

(σk ≲1),

and the integral (B.1) reduces to the integral of sum of two Gaussians, that is
