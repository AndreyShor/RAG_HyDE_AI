5. Computational setup
We define the square enclosure as 𝐻∶= [−1 m, 1 m] × [−1 m, 1 m] with the side length 𝐿of 2 m. Zero-velocity
Dirichlet conditions are applied at all boundaries. We set the density (𝜌), thermal expansion coefficient (𝛽), gravitational
acceleration (𝐺), specific heat (𝑐𝑝), and hot temperature (𝑇ℎ) to 1.00, while the cold temperature (𝑇𝑐) and reference
temperature (𝑇ref) are set to 0.00. The dynamic viscosity (𝜇) and thermal conductivity (𝜅) are both set to 2
√
2×10−2.5.
All units used in this study are expressed in the International System of Units (SI). This parameter set results in a
Rayleigh number of 𝑅𝑎= 105 and a Prandtl number of 𝑃𝑟= 1.0. We consider three different shapes for 𝑊: equilateral
heptagon, equilateral octagon, and equilateral nonagon. To expand the range of geometries, we also rotate the inner
cylinders. Details of the generated geometries are provided in Table 1. A total of 135 geometries are generated. For
the point clouds 𝑉𝑖(1 ≤𝑖≤𝑚), we set 𝑁= 5000, 𝑀1 = 4340, 𝑀2 = 660, 𝑀3 = 492, 𝑀4 = 105, and 𝑀5 = 130. A
similar data set was used by Kashefi and Mukerji [20].
Due to computational constraints, we were limited to a maximum batch size of 7. Consequently, we set the batch
size parameter, , to 7 for this study. The Adam optimizer [117] is employed with hyperparameters set to 𝛽1 = 0.9,
𝛽2 = 0.999, and ̂𝜖= 10−8. For a comprehensive understanding of the mathematical definitions of 𝛽1, 𝛽2, and ̂𝜖, one
may refer to Ref. [117]. We use a constant learning rate of 0.0005 and iterate for 2500 epochs. We report the results at
the iteration where the minimum loss is obtained during these 2500 epochs. From an engineering perspective, this is
reasonable because iterations cannot continue indefinitely due to limited computational resources.
We deploy 105 sensors inside the domains and 25 sensors on the surface of the inner cylinders, as depicted in Fig.
2. Sensors inside the domains (shown as green triangles in Fig. 2) measure velocity, pressure, and temperature, while
sensors on the inner surfaces (shown as red squares in Fig. 2) measure only pressure and temperature. The placement
of 25 sensors on the inner cylinder surface and 25 sensors surrounding the cylinder is slightly adjusted according to
the cross-sectional shape, while the remaining 80 sensors are fixed across all the geometries.
For generating sparse data at virtual sensor locations and validating the results obtained by PI-KAN-PointNet, we
use one of our high-fidelity finite element numerical solvers. This solver has been previously employed in the literature
[118, 119, 120, 121, 122]. Note that the point clouds used are a subset of the grid vertices from finite element meshes
employed by the numerical solver.

and temperature, whereas red squares represent sensors measuring only pressure and temperature.
