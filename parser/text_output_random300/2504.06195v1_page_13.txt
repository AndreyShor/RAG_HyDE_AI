 Table 1. Linear regression 1-dimensional fitting metrics for the peak shifts in Fig. 6. 
Note 1: The peak locations (in nm) mentioned in the table refer to their locations at the bulk index of 1.3. 
 
4. Machine learning based full spectrum modeling for precision enhancement 
Figure 7 summarizes the modeling performance across the four datasets by comparing (a) the 
mean squared error (MSE) of the full-spectrum linear regression model using 80 principal 
components, (b) the corresponding fold enhancement in MSE relative to the best-performing 
single-feature linear fit, and (c) the MSE values for those best single predictors. These comparisons 
are made in light of the distinct spectral profiles observed in earlier figures. 
 
Figure 7. Modeling performance across datasets: (a) Full-spectrum MSE using 80 PCA components, (b) fold 
improvement over best single-feature fit, and (c) MSE of best single-feature model (peak shifts for Si). Error bars 
indicate standard deviation from five-fold cross-validation. 
In Figure 7(a), Ti-based structures (Ti–TM and Ti–TE) exhibit extremely low MSEs of 6.32 × 
10⁻⁵ and 1.05 × 10⁻⁴, respectively, when using full-spectrum modeling with 80 PCA components. 
These values are orders of magnitude lower than those of the Si-based structures: 0.0068 for Si–
