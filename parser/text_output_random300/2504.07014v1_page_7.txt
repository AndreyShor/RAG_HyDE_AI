topological Lifshitz transition, when the Fermi sea changes its connectivity: the number of
disconnected Fermi patches changes from two to four. In the IC phase the wave numbers of
oscillations (Fermi momenta) evolve smoothly in the range kF,1/2 ∈[π/2, kmax]. At the third
critical point the roots z± become complex conjugate:
µ = µc,2 : z∓= e±2ikmax .

(4). In the second gapped phase (plateau ¯n = 1) four roots (A21) smoothly move away from
the unit circle, but stay complex, such that
µ > µc,2 : 1/z± = z∗
∓.

This gapped phase is oscillating, with the IC wave number of oscillations decaying smoothly
from the value kmax at the phase boundary µ = µc,2, see Fig. 5. This phase is similar to the
oscillating gapped phase of the transverse XY chain [34].
We denote the real and complex parts of k ∈C as
k ≡q + iκ,
(14)
and define two critical indices2 near the points which are complex zeros of the partition
function at T →0 as
q −m
n π ≡δq ∝|g −g′
c|ν′
(15)
κ ∝|g −gc|ν .
(16)
Here g is some parameter controlling the distance to the critical point. The points g′
c where
the IC oscillations with the wave number δq set in, are called disorder lines [36]. gc is the
quantum critical point where the correlation length ξ ≡1/κ diverges. In general gc ̸= g′
c
and ν ̸= ν′. Taking the modulated transverse quantum XY chain as an example, one can
check the previous statement by inspection of the model’s ground-state phase diagram and
the critical indices. This is also the case for the ladder at µ = µc,2, cf. Eq. (A27). The
disorder lines and the lines of quantum phase transitions could merge only at some special
points [29].
The representative results for q and κ are shown in Fig. 5

A.
Free fermions
The lessons we learned from the toy ladder model allow us to make some important
generalizations for the gapless (metallic) phases of d-dimensional fermions. All the rele-
vant formulas and derivations for the non-relativistic and relativistic (Dirac) fermions are
presented in Sections B 1 and B 2 of Appendix B, respectively.
For fermions with different spectra considered, a phase transition can occur only at T = 0.
It is signalled by zeros of the partition function in the range of real values k ∈Rd in
the reciprocal (momentum) space at finite volume V , cf. notations (14) where k ≡|k|.
2 The critical index ν′ in different notation was first introduces in [35]
