and ⟨ψyi=1 | ψyi=1⟩/⟨ψyi=0 | ψyi=0⟩= 1/4 for all i.1 Then, the Schr¨odinger equation with de-
coherence predicts 2n distinct universes, one for each possible outcome sequence. The Born
rule, however, makes strong additional predictions: it asserts that each individual measure-
ment yields yi = 1 with a probability of 20%. Given the independence of measurements,
this implies that the sum y = Pn
i=1 yi will be observed in the interval [100, 300] with virtual
certainty (probability 1 −2.2 · 10−14). Remarkably, those outcomes with y ∈[100, 300] rep-
resent less than 10−37 of all possible 2n universes, demonstrating how the Born rule severely
constrains which branches of the multiverse we observe.
□
The Born rule’s predictions have been experimentally veriﬁed to high precision. However,
the status of the Born rule as a fundamental law is problematic for two reasons: Firstly, it re-
quires two independent laws of time evolution — the Schr¨odinger equation for state evolution,
and the Born rule to give the probability of observed multiverse branches (e.g. restricting us
to a 10−37 fraction of possible universes with probability 1−2.2·10−14 in the above example).
Secondly, it postulates a probability distribution over the decoherent branches of the multi-
verse, which are emergent rather than fundamental objects — a fundamental law of nature
should not depend on emergent phenomena.
We propose resolving these issues analogously to the Many-Worlds solution of the mea-
surement problem:
(a) One law of motion: We eliminate the Born rule as a fundamental postulate, retaining
only an augmented Schr¨odinger equation as a single law of motion. The augmentation
we require is a mechanism for “small-signal truncation”, which dynamically eliminated
branches of the multiverse whose total amplitude becomes relatively low.
(b) Macroscopic emergent phenomena: The Born rule emerges as a macroscopic con-
sequence of this law, similar to how wave function collapse emerges from decoherence.
1We write ⟨ψ1 | ψ2⟩for the inner product of any quantum states ψ1 and ψ2. According to the Born rule,
our assumtion ⟨ψyi=1 | ψyi=1⟩/⟨ψyi=0 | ψyi=0⟩= 1/4 implies that the outcome yi = 0 is four times as likely as
the outcome yi = 1.
