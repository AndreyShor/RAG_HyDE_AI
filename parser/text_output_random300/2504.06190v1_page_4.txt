No-scale supergravity
tant works, the rest of this contribution will be focused on some aspects of
no-scale supergravity that are standing the test of more than four decades
of theoretical and experimental progress and are still relevant for current
research.
1.2 Four-dimensional no-scale models
1.2.1 Basics of N = 1, d = 4 supergravity
A N = 1, d = 4 supergravity model with chiral multiplets ϕi ∼(zi, ψi) and
vector multiplets Ua ∼(λa, Aa
µ) is specified by three ingredients 3. The first
is the real and gauge-invariant function
G = K + log |W|2 ,
(1.1)
where K is the real Kähler potential and W the holomorphic superpotential.
If we are not interested in the gauging of the R-symmetry, leading to con-
stant Fayet–Iliopoulos terms, we can assume that both K and W are gauge
invariant. The second is the holomorphic gauge kinetic function fab. Gener-
alized Chern–Simons terms may also be needed, but they will not play any
rôle here. The third are the holomorphic Killing vectors Xa = Xi
a(z)(∂/∂zi),
which generate the analytic isometries of the Kähler manifold for the scalar
fields that are gauged by the vector fields. In the following, for simplicity,
we will always denote G, fab and Xa as functions of the complex scalars zi
rather than the superfields ϕi.
The gauge transformation laws and covariant derivatives for the scalars in
the chiral multiplets read
δzi = Xi
a ϵa ,
Dµzi = ∂µzi −Aa
µXi
a ,
(1.2)
where ϵa are real parameters. The classical scalar potential is made of three
contributions, controlled by the auxiliary fields of the gravitational, chiral
and vector multiplets:
V0 = VG + VF + VD ,
VG = −3 eG ≤0 ,
VF = eGGiGi ≥0 ,
VD = 1
2DaDa ≥0 .
(1.3)
In the above equations, eG is the field-dependent gravitino mass term m2
3/2,
Gi = ∂G/∂zi, scalar field indices are raised with the inverse Kähler metric
Gik, gauge indices are raised with [(Ref)−1]ab, and
Da = i Gi Xi
a = i Ki Xi
a .
