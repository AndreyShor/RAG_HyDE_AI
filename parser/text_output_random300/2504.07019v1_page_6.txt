Iterative diagonalization.– Here we give an overview
of the NH-NRG algorithm, highlighting key differences
with the Hermitian formulation described in Ref. [41]. In
the following we assume a bi-orthonormal basis [6] such
that the inner product of left and right states satisfies
⟨n|m⟩L,R = δnm.
Further details can be found in the
Supplemental Material [46].
At step N+1 of the NH-NRG calculation, we construct
the Hamiltonian matrix Hb
N+1 with elements,
⟨N + 1; k; r|L
b ˆHN+1 |N + 1; k′; r′⟩R
b ,
(E.1)
where L(R) refers to the left(right) states, and the b sub-
script denotes the basis states, which are decomposed as,
|N + 1; k; r⟩L(R)
b
= |k⟩N+1 ⊗|N; r⟩L(R)
d
.
(E.2)
Here |N; r⟩L(R)
d
are the Nk retained left(right) eigen-
states of the previous iteration satisfying ˆHN |N; r⟩R
d =
EN(r) |N; r⟩R
d and ⟨N; r|L
d ˆHN = ⟨N; r|L
d EN(r); whereas
|k⟩N+1 = {|−⟩, |↓⟩, |↑⟩, |↑↓⟩} are the four states of the
added orbital N + 1, labeled respectively by the index
k = {0, −1, +1, 2}, which are equal for L and R.
From the recursion relation ˆHN+1 = ˆHN + ˆTN+1 and
Eq. (E.2), we may then express the matrix elements as,
⟨N + 1; k; r|L
b ˆHN+1 |N + 1; k′; r′⟩R
b

= ⟨k|N+1 ⟨N; r|L

where in the last two lines we inserted the identity
between the creation and annihilation operators [46].
Here, M σ
kk′ = (M σ
k′k)† denotes the trivial matrix element
⟨k|fN+1σ|k′⟩N+1 whose value does not depend on N.
Thus we can construct the Hamiltonian matrix Hb
N+1
at NRG iteration N + 1 using information from iteration
N. Specifically, we need the set of complex eigenvalues
EN(r), and the matrix elements ⟨N; r|L
d f †
Nσ |N; r′⟩R
d and
⟨N; r|L
d fNσ |N; r′⟩R
d which in the NH case are not Her-
mitian conjugates and need to be computed separately.
With Hb
N+1 in hand, we diagonalize the matrix to
obtain the eigenvalues EN+1 and the left and right
eigenvectors |N + 1; r⟩L(R)
d
.
Specifically,
Hb
N+1
=
UR
N+1Hd
N+1(UL
N+1)† where Hd
N+1 is the diagonal ma-
trix of eigenvalues EN+1 and UR(L)
N+1 is a matrix whose
columns are the right(left) eigenvectors.
Therefore we
can expand the eigenstates as,
|N + 1; r⟩R(L)

N+1 (r; m, s)(†) |N + 1; m; s⟩R(L)

N+1 (r; m, s)(†) |m⟩N+1 |N; s⟩R(L)
d

(E.5)
We use this to construct the nontrivial matrix elements
required for the next step,
⟨N + 1; r|L

Note that only the ‘lowest’ Nk eigenstates are retained
at each step, meaning that the computational complexity
is approximately constant at each step. In practice this
Fock space truncation is done by retaining states with
the lowest real part of the complex eigenvalues EN.
As such, the chain can be built up iteratively, starting
from ˆH0 consisting of just the impurity and the Wil-
son zero-orbital. Since states with large Re(EN) are dis-
carded at each step, we focus on the states with pro-
gressively smaller Re(EN) as the calculation proceeds.
To analyze the RG flow we specify EN with respect to
the state with the lowest Re(EN) at that iteration, and
rescale by a factor of ΛN/2. It is these rescaled eigenval-
ues that are plotted in the figures.
Truncation
schemes
and
numerical
precision.–
Through extensive numerical testing, we found that
truncation to the Nk states with the lowest Re(EN) at
each step yields the most stable and accurate results. In
this Letter we presented results for Λ = 3 and Nk = 400,
which we explicitly checked were numerically converged
with respect to increasing Nk (essentially no change
in the RG flow was observed by increasing Nk to 1024
kept states).
In certain cases we observed numerical
instabilities in the diagonalization which were completely
resolved by using high-precision numerics.
All of the
results presented were confirmed to be converged using
128-bit precision complex numbers [82].
Other truncation schemes (discussed further below)
were investigated.
For example, truncation to the Nk
states with the lowest magnitude |EN| produces a some-
what different set of states being tracked along the RG
flow. However, retained states common to both trunca-
tion schemes were found to have exactly the same RG
