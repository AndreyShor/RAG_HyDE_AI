The duality of ˜ιN and ˜ι∗

To understand the usage of the functions fN

Then, all hN

where we denoted 1d = (1, . . . , 1) ∈Rd. The next results shows that the concentrations cN
enjoy a higher integrability as the one obtained from the uniform bound KE for EN. For this
we use the bound KS
diﬀin (5.2d) and a suitable Galiardo-Nirenberg interpolation applied to ˜uN.
We ﬁrst show that ∇˜uN is uniformly bounded in L2([0, T] × Td), which is a consequence of the
fact that SN,diﬀ(cN) is in fact a quadratic form in UN.
Lemma 5.3 (Spatial regularity). Let cN satisfy the a priori estimates (5.2d). Then, we have
