computed using a minimization tolerance of 10−12. Again, spurious oscillations are
correctly eliminated within the SPM. When comparing the total energy spectrum
calculated within the two models: BSB and jellium, two important things are worth
mentioning. First, there is a shift of about 0.15 a.u. in the position of the peaks,
which is the BSB spectrum displaced towards the threshold with respect to the jellium
spectrum. This shift was adjudicated to the rugosity of the BSB potential [12, 13, 29].
Very importantly, the Ramsauer-Towsend oscillations in the jellium spectrum are
washed out in the BSB model because the surface potential is described with smooth
walls.
