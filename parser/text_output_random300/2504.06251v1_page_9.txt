is distinct from the pentalayer BG (Extended Data Fig. 4). The Fermi surface map of R5G shows a
small pocket centered at the K point. When moving down in energy, the pocket expands, and more
pockets from other valence bands are observed. Figure 2b-e shows dispersion images measured
by cutting parallel to the Γ-K direction (indicated by black and red lines in Fig. 2a), which clearly
shows the flat band at the Fermi energy (indicated by red arrows). NanoARPES data measured at
different sample positions show the same dispersion (Extended Data Fig. 5), again supporting that
the sample is of high quality with uniform electronic structure. We note that these two non-aligned
samples with different large twist angles both show the same electronic structure (see Extended
Data Fig. 6 the comparison between two non-aligned samples), supporting that the experimental
electronic structure is intrinsic to R5G.
The high-quality data allow to reveal the evolution of the top valence band as well as the
other four valence bands at high binding energy, which are all well captured by tight-binding
calculations shown in Fig. 2f-i. A detailed comparison between experimental data and calculated
band structures (Fig. 2j) allows us to extract key hopping parameters (labeled in Fig. 2k), which
are critical in determining the fundamental electronic structure of RG. In particular, NanoARPES
intensity maps allow to resolve the trigonal warping in Fig. 2l-n, where the warping direction
reverses from -0.1 eV (Fig. 2l) to -0.7 eV (Fig. 2n). Besides the leading hopping terms, γ0 and
γ1, a comparison of the extensive experimental data set with theoretical calculations (Fig. 2o,p)
also helps to nail down two delicate while fundamentally important inter-layer skewed hopping
parameters, γ3 and γ4, as listed in Table 1. Note that the delicate electronic structure near the charge
neutral point (CNP) is sensitively dependent on γ3 and γ4, which could drive Lifshitz transition32,40
