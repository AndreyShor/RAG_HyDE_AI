4. Applications to metallic surfaces
In this section, we apply our study on the retrieval of the energy spectrum and
the elimination of spurious oscillations to photoemission from metallic surfaces. We
consider grazing incidence of an ultrashort laser pulse of duration in the range from
femto- to attoseconds on a metallic surface.
We characterize the pulse as a time-
dependent electric ﬁeld linearly polarized along ˆz, perpendicular to the solid surface
within the dipole approximation.
Because of this interaction, the solid surface is
ionized, so that an electron located in the valence band of the solid is promoted
to the continuum. Using the single active electron (SAE) approximation, the total
Hamiltonian is described by
H(r, t) = −∇2

where −∇2
r/2 is the electron kinetic energy, VS(z) is the potential that represents
