characterized through experimental and theoretical approaches.30 Also, several SHG and SFH 
experiments were done to study solid liquid interfaces for different mineral oxides like silica, alu- 
mina, titania, etc.31,32 The solid/liquid interfaces in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) play a pivotal 
role in diverse domains of natural sciences and industrial applications, encompassing fields such 
as photovoltaics33,34 and medical applications.35 In the realm of photovoltaics, a comprehensive 
understanding of efficient exciton transport, which directly impacts the overall efficiency of photo- 
voltaic devices, heavily relies on the intricate nature of interactions and structures at the interfaces. 
Similarly, the establishment of a structure-function relationship of QDs at biological interfaces 
holds significant importance for the successful utilization of QDs in biomedical applications. De- 
spite the availability of numerous techniques, ranging from surface second harmonic generation 
to heterodyne-detected phase-resolved two-dimensional vibrational sum frequency generation, for 
studying QDs with their high surface-to-volume ratio, these approaches primarily focus on the 
surface and interface regions. 
However, they fail to provide comprehensive information when one seeks to investigate both 
the interface and the interface-to-bulk interactions within the same experimental setup. One ex- 
ample of a powerful technique is heterodyne-detected two-dimensional vibrational sum frequency 
spectroscopy (2D VSFS), which incorporates phase information to determine both the imaginary 
and real components of the second-order nonlinear susceptibility. This enables a more detailed 
analysis of molecular orientations based on the nature of vibrational modes. However, this tech- 
nique lacks efficiency in establishing a direct connection between changes occurring at the interface 
and the bulk information.23 In contrast, 2D electronic spectroscopy,36â€“41 as a phase-resolved third- 
order nonlinear process, offers the advantage of a single experimental setup to efficiently provide 
comprehensive electronic information about the system, bridging the interface-to-bulk connection. 
With appropriate experimental design and meticulous data analysis, 2D electronic spectroscopy 
can complement VSFS by elucidating surface potentials, electronic environments, and charge sep- 
aration processes across the entire system, extending from the interface to the bulk. 
Standard techniques such as interface-sensitive SHG and VSFS have been employed to inves-
