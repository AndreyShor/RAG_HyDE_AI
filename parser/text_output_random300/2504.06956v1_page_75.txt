Now, using the bound (A.5) and the fact that ζ(s) = o(s1/4) as s →∞(since ι ∈(0, 1/8)), we obtain
that

Brownian bridge above a negative curve
Proposition A.5. For ι ∈(0, 1/8), let ζ : R+
0 →R+
0 be a continuous and non-decreasing function
such that ζ(0) > 1 and ζ(s) = o(sι) as s →∞, and let x > ζ(0). Then, for all b ≥1 sufficiently
large and u ∈[bι, b3/4], it holds that
Px,u,b(τ−ζ > b) ≤(1 + eδ)2xu

where, recalling the definition (A.7) of the function ρ, the function eρ : R+

(A.10)
The proof of Proposition A.5 is based on the following lemma.
Lemma A.6. For ι ∈(0, 1/8), let ζ : R+
0 →R+
0 be a continuously differentiable and non-decreasing
function such that ζ(0) > 1 and ζ(s) = o(sι) as s →∞. Then, for all b ≥1 sufficiently large and
u ∈[bι, b3/4], it holds that
P0,u,b(τ−ζ > b) ≤16u

Proof. Recalling the notation introduced in the statement of Lemma A.2, we begin by noting that
P0,u,b(τ−ζ > b) ≤P0,u,b(τ−ζ(0) > b) + P0,u,b(−ζ(Tb) < Mb < −ζ(0)) .
(A.11)
The first probability on the right-hand side can be bounded by using (A.2) as follows
P0,u,b(τ−ζ(0) > b) ≤2ζ(0)(ζ(0) + u)
b
≤4u
b ζ(0) ,
where here we assumed that b ≥1 is taken large enough so that ζ(0)/u < 1 uniformly over all
u ∈[bι, b3/4]. Concerning the second probability on the right-hand side of (A.11), using (A.4) of
Lemma A.2, we have that
