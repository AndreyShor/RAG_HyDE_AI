 to be ~11% in a 9-layer 
FCGT flake, which agrees well with the magnitude ratio (~10.1%) of δRH and the saturated 
Hall resistance ΔRH in the Pt/FCGT device. Besides, as shown in Fig. 2g, the net magnetic 
moment exhibits a high anisotropy field, implying the strong magnetic coupling with the 
Néel vector in FCGT.  
The presence of nonzero net magnetic moments that breaks the time-reversal 
symmetry, plays a crucial role on the realisation of electrical 180° switching and detection 
of Néel vectors in collinear antiferromagnets. Notably, previous reports on net magnetic 
moments in antiferromagnets are mainly resulted from spin canting due to DMI16-21 and 
uncompensated magnetic moments at defects or interfaces15,16,22. Specifically, the 
occurrence of net magnetic moment that purely originates from DMI, requires strict spin 
and structural symmetries, which is rare among antiferromagnets19,20. In most 
antiferromagnets, the net magnetic moments are associated with defects or interfaces15,16,22, 
which are extrinsic. Its magnitude and orientation relation with Néel vector strongly 
depends on the material synthesize and fabrication process. In contrast to conventional 
thin-film antiferromagnets, we demonstrate that the magnitude of δm in the vdW 
antiferromagnet can be precisely modulated by varying the vdW-layer number and the 
direction of δm is unambiguously parallel to the Néel vector, i.e. δm//n (Supplementary 
Note 4). This controllable and intrinsic net magnetic moment can further serve as a handle 
for reliable SOT switching of Néel vector.  
Electrical 180° switching of Néel vector in Pt/FCGT 
We next demonstrate the electrical manipulation of Néel vector via SOTs. As shown 
in Fig. 3a, we employ the switching scheme used for SOT switching of a PMA ferromagnet: 
an in-plane magnetic field is applied along the direction of electric currents to assist the 
switching29,30. In the experiment, the FCGT flake with 11 vdW layers is used (Fig. 3b). By 
sweeping the currents with a fixed in-plane magnetic field, we observe a switching of the 
Hall resistance between the two resistance states corresponding to magnetic states of δm 
pointing to ↑ and ↓ (Fig. 3c). As δm is parallel to the Néel vector, the current-induced Hall 
resistance switching indicates the electrical switching of Néel vector. Note that the 
magnitude of the current-induced Hall resistance switching is almost equal to that switched
