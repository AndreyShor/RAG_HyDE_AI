where the time scale τk is set by the kinetic equation, which is a generalization of (A.1) to q-body
interactions. Schematically, the kinetic equation then gives,

k(nkkd)q−1

(A.7)
where the factor of ωkkd in the denominator comes from the energy conserving delta function and
the momentum conserving delta function. Inserting this τk into the flux gives,
P ∼λ2
k(nkkd)q−1 ,
Q ∼λ2
k(nkkd)q−1

Setting P or Q to be constant (which corresponds to a stationary solution), and using ωk ∼kα,
λk ∼kβ, gives the KZ solution, nk ∼k−γ with

(A.10)
where the direct cascade corresponds to nonzero P and vanishing Q, while the inverse cascade
is for nonzero Q and vanishing P. The inverse cascade only exists if the total particle number
R
ddx|Ψ(x)|2 is conserved, which requires that the interaction (A.3) have an equal number of
creation and annihilation operators. For q = 4, these γ reduce to (3.8) and (3.9). In the special
case of marginal interactions, D = 0, the scaling of the KZ state remains (3.10), for any q.
Finally, we note from (A.5) combined with (A.1) that increasing the coupling λ1234 while
maintaining constant flux requires decreasing the occupation numbers nk — a result we make use
of in the main body to connect how the flow of the coupling with scale influences the state.
B. Beta function from summing diagrams
In this appendix we give an alternative derivation of the beta function in theories with a
marginal interaction, by summing the leading log divergent diagrams.
