driven changes. The decrease after the year 2000 is stronger in the combined OHUE than in the 
NAT experiment (Figure 2c,d). 
Volcanic aerosol loading is the dominant driver of natural external forcing, with the 1991 Mount 
Pinatubo eruption standing out as a particularly significant event. This eruption, much stronger 
than other recent volcanic events, had notable impacts on the Earth's energy imbalance and ocean 
heat uptake (Gleckler et al., 2006; Allan et al., 2014; Santer et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2016). The 
OHC anomaly and vertical temperature profile (Figures 2e,f) reveal a sharp decline in temperature 
following the eruption and the penetration of cooling signal to the deeper layer, reaching its 
minimum around 1993, followed by a slower recovery phase (Santer et al., 2007; Takahashi & 
Watanabe, 2016). The relaxation time scale is approximately 10 years for the surface and upper 
ocean, while it extends from several decades to a century associated with the penetration of cold 
anomalies to the deeper ocean layers (Stenchikov et al., 2009; Dogar et al., 2020). Results across 
all models consistently show this temporal evolution of ocean heat uptake to natural external 
forcing (Figure S2 in Supporting Information). Notably, the Pinatubo-induced ocean heat uptake 
mainly contributes to the ocean warming rate (Figure 1e) and the recent variation in the OHUE 
(Figures 1a, 2c,d), reflecting a long-lasting volcanic signal in the ocean and its impact on the 
climate system.
