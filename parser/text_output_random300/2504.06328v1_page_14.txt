This encoding preserves the geometry of the orig-
inal feature space while embedding it in the high-
dimensional Hilbert space of the quantum system.
In principle, the quantum state now encodes not
only the magnitude relationships of the DFU fea-
tures but also allows interference and entanglement
effects if multiple qubits are used.
4.2.4. Hybrid Quantum-Classical Pipeline
After encoding the SPD-derived features into
quantum states, we feed them into a variational
quantum circuit.
The circuit (Fig. 3) consists of
parameterized single-qubit rotations and entangling
gates (e.g., CNOTs), forming a multi-layer ansatz
that can approximate complex decision boundaries.
We used PennyLane to simulate this quantum com-
ponent, and the final measurements (e.g., expecta-
tion values of Pauli-Z operators) are passed to a
small classical neural network or directly used for
classification.

sification.
The amplitude-encoded SPD features from the
modified Xception network are fed into a variational quan-
tum circuit. Outputs are then processed by a classical post-
processing layer to yield final class predictions. (Placeholder:

Training Procedure..
1. Classical Pretraining: Train or fine-tune the
modified Xception network to extract robust
DFU features (128-D vector).
2. SPD Construction: Convert these features
into an SPD representation to preserve geomet-
ric relationships.
3. Quantum Embedding and Optimization:
Encode each SPD vector into a quantum state,
then optimize the variational parameters of the
quantum circuit using gradient-based meth-
ods (e.g., Adam or quantum natural gradient).
The loss function is typically cross-entropy or a
margin-based criterion, depending on the clas-
sification setup.
4. Hybrid Inference:
During inference, each
DFU image is processed by the Xception net-
work, transformed to SPD form, embedded in
the quantum circuit, and then mapped to a fi-
nal class label.
4.2.5. Relevance and Insights
This DFU classification case study highlights the
flexibility of our hybrid geometric approach:
• Medical Imaging Context: DFU images of-
ten exhibit subtle color and textural cues in-
dicative of infection or ischaemia. By extract-
ing deep features and mapping them onto an
SPD manifold, we maintain the important geo-
metric relationships that might be lost in naive
Euclidean embeddings.
• Quantum Advantage Potential:
While
our experiments are currently simulated, the
amplitude-encoded states and variational cir-
cuits could exploit quantum interference to
separate complex patterns in fewer parameters
than classical networks alone.
• Generalizability:
Although
the
pipeline
is
described
for
DFU
classification,
the
same methodology—deep feature extraction,
SPD mapping, quantum embedding—can be
adapted to other medical or non-medical imag-
ing tasks that benefit from geometric insights.
Overall, this DFU case study provides strong em-
pirical evidence that combining geometric mani-
fold representations (SPD) with quantum embed-
dings can yield significant performance and inter-
pretability benefits.
We believe this approach is
especially well-suited for challenging medical imag-
ing scenarios where data distributions are complex
and high-dimensional, as exemplified by the wide
variability in DFU appearance (Fig. 2). Future re-
search will focus on evaluating these hybrid mod-
els on larger DFU datasets, integrating additional
