altering the yields of r-process isotopes [60, 61, 62, 63, 64]. This study combines these factors to 
explore their effects on nucleosynthesis and isotopic abundances in different galaxy types and an 
example kilonova event using the MvdW EoS.  The outline of the paper is as follows: in the next 
section we construct the theoretical model for elemental production, yields, opacities and EoS, 
then we look at the impact of varying the parameters of the EoS on element production, we then 
model galactic and kilonova production rates with and without massive neutrinos, we then 
compare these values to other models and observational data and finish with a conclusion.  
2. Derivation of Opacities for MvdW EoS 
The equation describing the balance between the production rate and loss mechanisms to 
determine the time rate of change of the abundance of a nuclear species X with number NX, at 
any time is given as

where we utilize the normalized Salpeter [65, 66, 67] initial mass function Φimf and the M 
overdot indicates the time derivative. The first term represents the production of the nuclear 
species X due to kilonovae stellar or galactic sources: for the kilonova example it is the mass rate 
from the ejecta, and for the galactic applications it is the stellar creation rate for each galaxy 
type, this is multiplied by the yield, Y, from fission decay or fusion capture processes for 
production, followed by the semiempirical Salpeter mass function,  Φimf, applied over the range 
of masses in the event for the highest to the lowest mass. From this we subtract the losses due to 
photodisintegration or loss due to neutron capture, which depends on the total opacity function κ, 
and the radioactive decay losses as the product of the decay rate λx = <σxv>, with cross section 
σx, where we use the NIST thermal cross sections and rates [68] and BNL energy dependent 
cross sections with Legendre coefficients [69], and velocity v, and the number of nuclei Nx. The 
yield functions are given for the r process as
