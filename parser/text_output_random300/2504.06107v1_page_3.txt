the combined flavor⊗color⊗spin space for the doubly-
charmed hexaquark system. For the ground state, the
spatial wave function is symmetric under the exchange
of any two identical quarks or diquarks. In accordance
with the Spin-Statistics Theorem, this necessitates that
the flavor⊗color⊗spin component must be antisymmetric
(symmetric) under the permutation of identical quarks
(diquarks).
This framework parallels earlier theoretical studies of
the Θ+ pentaquark [45], where Jaffe and Wilczek [46]
treated two diquarks as bosonic point-like constituents
within a diquark-diquark-antiquark configuration. Their
model predicted the Θ+ as a bound state of two identical
diquarks and an anti-strange quark, alongside an isospin

near 1750 MeV [46].
Subsequent works by Liu et al.
extended this approach to compute magnetic moments of
analogous pentaquark states [47–50]. While experimental
confirmation of Θ+ and Ξ−−
5
remains elusive [51, 52],
the symmetry-driven methodology developed for these
systems provides a valuable foundation for constructing
hexaquark wave functions.
Guided by these principles, we derive total wave func-
tions for distinct flavor configurations that rigorously sat-
isfy the Spin-Statistics Theorem. The resulting configu-
rations are tabulated in Tables IV–VI.
A critical distinction arises in the role of interaction
terms: while Coulomb and linear confinement potentials
do not induce color-spin mixing, the hyperfine interac-
tion term does. The hyperfine interaction strength scales
as 1/mimj, where mi and mj denote the masses of the
charm quark or diquarks ([nn], [ns], [ss]). Given that
all constituent masses exceed 1 GeV, color-spin mixing
is strongly suppressed in the doubly-charmed hexaquark
system. This suppression significantly simplifies the spec-
troscopic analysis compared to light-quark systems.

Numerical calculation method

Gaussian expansion method
In the spatial space, the Jacobi coordinates for a four-
body system are defined in terms of single-particle coor-
dinates xi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) as follows:
ξ1 =
p
1/2(x1 −x2),
ξ2 =
p
1/2(x3 −x4),
ξ3 = (m1x1 + m2x2
m1 + m2
) −(m3x3 + m4x4
m3 + m4
),
(6)
R = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3 + m4x4
m1 + m2 + m3 + m4
.
Here, ξ1 represents the relative Jacobi coordinate within
the diquarks [q1q2] and [q3q4]. Meanwhile, ξ2 denotes the
relative Jacobi coordinate between the charm quarks c.
While ξ3 describes the relative Jacobi coordinate between
the centers of mass of the two diquarks ([qq][qq]) and the
two charm quarks (cc). Using above Jacobi coordinates
(Eq. (6)), the spatial wave function with well-defined
symmetry for the pairs (12) and (34) can be readily con-
structed. In the center-of-mass frame of the four-body
system (R = 0) and the number of Jacobi coordinates
reduces to three (see Fig. 1).
The kinetic term in the Hamiltonian (Eq. (1)) can be
simplified for calculations. Denoted as Tc, it is expressed
as:

The Gaussian expansion method (GEM) [53–55] is
employed to solve the four-body Schr¨odinger equation.
This method has been widely applied to baryons [56],
