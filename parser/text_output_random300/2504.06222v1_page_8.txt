3. Discussion 
3.1.  Mechanisms of cracking and composition evolutions  
The OIHP single crystals experience crack initiation and propagation under the e-beam radiation, 
and structural and composition changes under the X-ray beam radiation. Both phenomena are 
associated with the volatilization of organic components. Figure 5a illustrates the schematic 
process, resembling the desiccation cracking of clay soil during drying, and Figure 5b illustrates 
the corresponding structural and composition evolutions from the perspective of energy conversion. 
In clay soil, volume shrinkage occurs as water evaporates. When this shrinkage is constrained, 
tensile stress develops within the soil. Once the tensile stress exceeds the soil’s strength, cracks 
initiate [40-42]. For FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 single crystals, the high-energy beam radiation 
induces the volatilization of FA+ and MA+ organic cations on the crystal surface, causing light
