and large ρxy. As we elaborate in the following, this state is a RIQAH state. 2) A similar 
RIQAH state occurs at νh slightly higher than 2/3 under a finite D-field. 3) At νh from 
approximately 0.71 to 0.76 around D = 0, both ρxx and ρxy vanish, suggesting the 
emergence of a superconducting state. These features will be the main focus of the 
following sections. 
 
IQAH, FQAH and RIQAH effects 
Figures 2c-2h show ρxx and ρxy, respectively, at different νh, D points with local ρxx dips 
and nearly quantized ρxy (marked in Fig. 2a,2b), as a function of B at a nominal mixing 
chamber temperature TMC of 15 mK (Methods). Temperature dependence data at these 
νh, D points are shown in Extended Data Fig. 3. Clear magnetic hysteresis loops are 
observed at all selected νh, D points. The coercive field is largest at νh = 1 and D = 0, 
around 100 mT, and approximately 15-30 mT at other νh, D points at TMC =15 mK. As 
shown in Fig. 2c, at νh = 1 and D = 0, ρxy is quantized at h/e2 at zero magnetic field, 
with a residual ρxx ≈ 100 Ω, consistent with previous studies [3,4]. Notably, at νh =2/3 
and D = 0 (Fig. 2f), ρxy is quantized at 3h/2e2 at zero magnetic field, with a residual ρxx 
≈ 300 Ω. This is the lowest residual ρxx value reported so far for FQAH effects. At νh = 
3/5 (Fig. 2g) and 4/7 (Fig. 2h) at D = 0, the zero-field anomalous Hall signals also 
approach to the expected quantized value, but with less accuracy and relatively large 
residual ρxx (~ 5 kΩ), as compared to νh = 2/3. This might be attributed to less good 
contacts at low filling factors and smaller FQAH gaps at νh = 3/5 and 4/7. 
 
Figure 2d illustrate similar magnetic field scan data of ρxx and ρxy at νh = 0.63 and D = 
0. Intriguingly, at this incommensurate moiré filling, the measured ρxy is also quantized 
at h/e2 at B = 0, with residual ρxx < 1 kΩ. We refer to this state as the RIQAH effect, 
the lattice analogue of the reentrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) effect observed 
previously in Landau levels [17-21]. Similarly, at νh = 0.70 and D = -27 mV/nm, another 
RIQAH appears (Fig. 2e). Although it emerges at a finite D field at B = 0, it extends 
across a broader D field range under higher magnetic fields (Extended Data Fig. 4).  
 
The nature of the IQAH, FQAH, and RIQAH states can be further examined by 
measuring ρxx as a function of νh and B. As shown in Fig. 2i and 2j, all the states 
mentioned above featured by local ρxx dips which show linear shift in νh with increasing 
B. The dispersion of the FQAH states agrees well with expected Chern number C

ℎ (Extended Data Fig. 5), as illustrated by 
the dashed lines. In particular, the νh = 2/3, 3/5, and 4/7 FQAH states persist to B = 0 T, 
while the νh = 5/9 state persists to B ≈ 0.5 T. Although evidences for the νh = 4/7 and νh 
= 5/9 FQAH states has been reported in tMoTe2 by recent nano SQUID measurements
