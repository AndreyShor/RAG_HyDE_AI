Figure 4.4: The singlet matrix of splitting functions xPij at LO, NLO, NNLO and aN3LO. From left to
right and from top to bottom the gg, gq, qg and qq entries are shown. The MHOU estimated by scale
variation is shown to all orders. At aN3LO the dark blue band corresponds to IHOU only, while the light
blue band is the sum in quadrature of IHOU and MHOU.
Based on these results it is clear that in the non-singlet sector the N3LO contribution to the
splitting function is essentially negligible except at the smallest x values, as shown in Fig. 4.1.
Consequently, for all practical purposes we can consider the current approximation to the
non-singlet anomalous dimension to be essentially exact, and with negligible MHOU.
The situation in the singlet sector is more challenging. The singlet matrix of splitting functions is
shown in Figs. 4.4 and 4.5, respectively with a logarithmic or linear scale on the x axis. Because
the diagonal splitting functions are distributions at x = 1 in the linear scale plots we display
x(1 −x)Pii. The corresponding relative size of the MHOU is shown in Fig. 4.6 for the first four
perturbative orders, along with the IHOU on the aN3LO result, determined using Eq. (4.9).
A different behavior is observed for the quark sector Pqi and for the gluon sector Pgi. In the
quark sector, the MHOU decreases with perturbative order for all x, but it remains sizable at
aN3LO for essentially all x, of order 5 % for 10−2 ≲x ≲10−1. In the gluon sector instead for
x ≳0.03 the MHOU is negligible, but at smaller x it grows rapidly, and in fact at very small x it
becomes larger than the NLO MHOU. This is due to the presence of leading small-x logarithms,
Eq. (4.14), which are absent at NLO. In fact the true gluon-sector MHOU at very small x is likely
