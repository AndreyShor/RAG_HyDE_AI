1.1
Motivation
The recently renewed interest in studying the role that instantons with fractional topological
charge [2–5] play in gauge dynamics is motivated by several developments. The newest one
is the discovery of generalized anomalies involving 1-form (center) symmetry [6, 7]. Here,
the introduction of fractional charge backgrounds is used to reveal various ’t Hooft anomalies
involving center symmetry (these lead to, for example, exact spectral degeneracies at finite
volume [8]). Another development is the somewhat older observation [9, 10] that objects with
