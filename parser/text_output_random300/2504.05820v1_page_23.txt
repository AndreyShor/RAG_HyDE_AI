Table 1.2: Structure functions classification.
The functions Fk, gk appearing in Eq. (1.27) are called hadronic structure functions and encode
all the information about how the partons are distributed inside the hadrons. First, we observe
that terms linearly proportional to the hadron spin Sµ vanish when averaging over the hadron
polarizations. Thus, for unpolarized observables only structure functions Fk survive. The
opposite holds for observables in which the target is polarized, where gk, called polarized
structure functions, are the only contribution.
Second, we note that some structure functions are fully antisymmetric and thus are parity
violating. This is manifest for F3 which has to vanish for EM DIS only. For polarized structure
functions, the spin operator is also odd under parity, thus we refer to g1, g2 as parity conserving
and to g3, g4, g5 as parity violating (see Table 1.2).
Third, for longitudinal hadron polarizations, after performing all the contractions with Lµν
j ,
the structure functions g2 and g3 turn out to be fully proportional to M2/Q2 [27], thus are
suppressed in the high energy limit, M2/Q2 →0 and, they are not be considered further in this
work. In this limit the symmetry between the unpolarized and polarized is fully visible, and we
obtain the relations:
F1 ↔−g5,
F2 ↔−g4,
xF3 ↔2xg1 .
(1.29)
For reasons which will be clear later, it is convenient to introduce the linear combinations:
FL = F2 −2xF1,
gL = g4 −2xg5,

Finally, inserting Eqs. (1.23) to (1.27), in Eq. (1.20), we get the expressions for unpolarized
and double (longitudinally) polarized cross-section:

Here h denotes the hadron polarization, the factor Y± = 1 ± (1 −y)2 and the sign ∓refers to
positive or negative polarized charged leptons ℓ±. To define the normalization factors ξi, with
i ∈{NC, CC}, we have to sum over the different contributions given by each boson. For CC,
