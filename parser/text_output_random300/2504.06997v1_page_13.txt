in Sec. 2.4, CBFi was varied by ±25% and ±50% relative to the baseline. The results were 
visualized using bar graphs, as shown in Fig. 8. The bar heights represent the mean of the recovered 
data, and the error bars indicate the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentile) to facilitate visual 
comparison of central trends while minimizing distortion from non-Gaussian distributions. Fig. 8 
(a) shows that the proposed DL model exhibits greater sensitivity to CBFi changes across all 
variation levels, although the sensitivities of both methods remain below 100%. The DL model 
achieves an average CBFi sensitivity of 87.1%, compared to 55.4% for single-exponential fitting. 
Fig. 8 (b) presents the recovered CBF changes using the DL model and single-exponential fitting. 
The DL model provides more accurate relative change recovery than fitting, with an average 
relative flow recovery error 5.8%, compared to 19.1% for fitting, calculated using Eq. (11). And 
both methods underestimated the true values, which is consistent with the results in Fig. 7. 
Additionally, in Fig. 8 (a) and (b), the error bars at different 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 variation levels indicate that 
the DL model has a lower standard deviation than fitting when 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 is smaller than the 
baseline. However, the opposite trend is observed when 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 is larger than the baseline. This 
suggests that the proposed DL model’s estimates are more consistent (lower variance) at low flows, 
but become more variable at high flows compared to fitting. This is likely because at very high 
flow rates, the correlation decay is extremely fast, nearing the edge of the measured lag range, 
making the network extrapolate more.

variation for single-exponential fitting and DL models. The error bars represent the 25th and 75th percentiles of the 
recovered data, providing an interquartile range-based measure of variability.

We also quantified the recovered CBFi sensitivity to SBFi changes using Eq. (10), with results 
presented in Fig. 9 (a). The proposed DL model exhibits a scalp sensitivity comparable to single-
exponential fitting, with average values of 12.7% and 10.0%, respectively. For rCBFi recovery, 
both methods demonstrate similar accuracy, with an average error of 4.6% for the DL model and 
3.8% for fitting, calculated using Eq. (11). These results indicate that both approaches have similar 
effectiveness in minimizing the influence of the extracerebral layer when recovering CBF changes. 
However, the error bars in both figures indicate that the proposed DL model exhibits a slightly 
larger standard deviation compared to single-exponential fitting, suggesting the DL estimates are 
a bit more variable with changing scalp flow.
