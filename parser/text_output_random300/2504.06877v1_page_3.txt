refrigerator (QCR) [48–50], a device based on a voltage-biased double or a single [51] normal-
metal–insulator–superconductor (NIS) junction. By changing the bias voltage, the same device
can be used for preparation of hot thermal states [52] which enables operation of a quantum
heat engine [53]. The dissipation induced by the QCR can also be controlled by rf drive [54,55]
and by quasithermal noise [56] in the Brownian refrigerator regime [14,57]. The performance
of QCR is typically limited by non-vanishing Dynes parameter of the superconducting lead and
the temperature of the electrons in the normal lead, which results in reduced on/off ratio of
the dissipation rate and imperfect cooling. These disadvantages are expected to be less re-
strictive in Josephson junctions, in which density of thermal quasiparticles is suppressed due
to the spectral gap and the negligible subgap density of states in the superconducting leads
enables one to completely turn off the dissipation. It has been shown that the dissipation in
the Josephson junctions can be enabled by applying dc bias voltage [58–60]. In this work,
we aim to explore the possibility of photonic cooling and heating with quasiparticle effects by
driving a Josephson junction with a strong microwave signal.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2, we start from the microscopic model
of a Josephson junction in quantized microwave field and derive a polarization operator of the
microwave field. The polarization operator plays the role of a kernel in the influence functional
arising from the fermionic bath. It also provides the time-nonlocal current-phase relation of
the junction and statistics of the noise via fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). In Sec. 3,
we linearize the quasiclassical expression for the current through the junction to calculate its
admittance with respect to a weak external microwave probe signal. We consider two cases:
a non-driven phase-biased Josephson junction and a junction under a strong monochromatic
drive. We show that the admittance of the junction as a function of complex frequency has
singularities at the real frequency axis and that the external drive multiplies these singularities
shifting them by integer multiple of drive frequency. As a result, the junction acquires non-
vanishing active response, which is a signature of multiphoton-assisted Cooper pair breaking.
In Sec. 4, we use the results of the previous Sections to analyze the dynamics of the microwave
field in an LC-circuit shunted by a driven Josephson junction in the linear regime. First,
we focus on the spectral properties of the LC-circuit and show the effect of the admittance
singularities on the line shape of the resonator. Then, we analyze the steady state population
of the LC-circuit and conclude that quasiparticle-enabled dissipation in the Josephson junction
may result in both cooling and heating of the resonator, depending on the frequency and
amplitude of the drive. Finally, we discuss our findings in Sec. 5.

Model
We start our analysis from a microscopic model of a Josephson junction in a quantized elec-
tromagnetic environment. Assuming the superconducting leads to be well described by the
standard mean-field BCS model [61], we write the microscopic Hamiltonian for both elec-
tronic and electromagnetic degrees of freedom [62] as

and charges of the circuit nodes [63] and coupling to any external field, whose precise form
is not relevant for our purposes. The index α = l,r denotes the left and right superconducting
leads, respectively, the index k enumerates orbital electronic modes in the normal state, and
