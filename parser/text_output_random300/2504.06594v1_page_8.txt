• ℏΩIndependence (or weak dependence): At Nf
max = 300, the predic-
tions should be stable with respect to the ℏΩvariations. We impose
the maximal allowable deviations of 2 keV for energies and of 0.002 fm
for radii.
• Convergence Principle (for energies only): For each network in the
ensemble, a critical model space Nc
max is deﬁned such that the network
predictions for this model space ﬁt the following two conditions. (1) In
the model space Nmax = Nc
max, the diﬀerence between the predicted
maximal and minimal energies in the range of ℏΩvalues included in the
prediction array do not exceed 20 keV. (2) The diﬀerence between the
predicted minimal energy values in adjacent model spaces Nmax = Nc
max
and Nmax = Nc
max + 2 do not exceed 1 keV.
From the networks that meet these criteria, the 20% with the highest
Nc
max values are discarded to ensure fast enough convergence behavior.
• Loss-Based Filtering: The 5% of networks with the largest loss function
values at the end of training are also discarded.
Outlier Filtering. Following the above initial selection procedure, an addi-
tional outlier ﬁltering step is performed [18]. For each neural network, pre-
dictions at Nmax = Nf
max are taken. In the case of energy predictions, the
minimal value is determined for the range of ℏΩvalues. For the radius pre-
dictions, the arithmetic mean is calculated for the range of ℏΩ.
This yields a distribution of extrapolated energy or radius values in the
network ensemble. To remove outliers from this distribution, we apply the
boxplot rule as described in Ref. [29].
A neural network is excluded from further statistical analysis if it fails
to meet any of the above selection criteria. This ensures that only models
exhibiting stable and physically consistent predictions contribute to the ﬁnal
ensemble results, enhancing the reliability of the overall approach.
Final Estimation and Uncertainty Quantiﬁcation. For the ﬁltered prediction
array at Nf
max, the median value is computed and serves as the ﬁnal esti-
mate of the observable. The interquartile range between the 25th and 75th
percentiles is used as a measure of the extrapolation uncertainty.
