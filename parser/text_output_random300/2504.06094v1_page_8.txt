Thus, (Z, c) belongs to the symmetric subcategory of Z(C) formed by the objects isomorphic
to (1⊕k
C , c). This category is monoidally equivalent to Rep ΓC, where ΓC is the universal grading
group of C, see [JMPP22, Theorem 3.23].
Example 3.2. Any element φ of the character group ˆΓC = Hom(ΓC, T) deﬁnes a half braiding cφ
on 1C (up to the identiﬁcation of 1C ⊗X and X ⊗1C with X) by
cφ
X = ω([X])idX : X →X
for irreducible X, where [X] is the element of Γ represented by X.
3.2. Half-line algebras and Jones’s basic extension. We now introduce a condition on
abstract spin chains that allows us to conclude ﬁniteness of the DHR bimodule category. First,
consider the algebras
A−= A(−∞,−1],
A+ = A[0,∞),
B0 = A−⊗A+,
which are all C∗-subalgebras of the quasi-local algebra A.
Recall that a conditional expectation E : C →D for an inclusion of C∗-algebras D ⊂C is of
ﬁnite index if there is a positive constant λ such that E(a) ≥λa holds for all positive a ∈C.
Condition 3.3 (Rationality). We say that A• is rational if there is a faithful conditional
expectation of ﬁnite index (in the sense of Watatani [Wat90]), E : A →B0.
This allows us to consider the basic extension
A ⊂B1 = ⟨A, e⟩,
and the dual expectation E1 : B1 →A. In particular, B1 admits an A-valued inner product
induced by E1.
4. Half-line categories
Since we can think of B1 as A⊠B0 A (see [Wat90]), given A-bimodules X and Y , the space of
B1-module maps between B1 ⊠A X and B1 ⊠A Y (considered in the category of A-bimodules) is
equivalent to the space of maps of B0-A-modules between X and Y . We then look for a better
description of the latter morphism system.
We assume that A• satisﬁes weak algebraic Haag duality 2.2 and the covering property 2.3.
4.1. General setting.
Proposition 4.1. Let X be a DHR bimodule over A•, and (ξj)j be a projective basis for X
localized in some ﬁnite subset of (−∞, −R−L−1], where R and L are the controlling constants
respectively from Conditions 2.2 and 2.3. Then the span X−= W
j ξjA−⊂X is an A−-A−-
correpondence, independent of the choice of (ξi)i.
Proof. Let us ﬁrst check that X−is a Hilbert A−-module, that is, that the inner product of
vectors ξ, η ∈X−belongs to A−.
By ⟨ξa|ηb⟩= a∗⟨ξ|η⟩b, we can reduce the claim to the case ξ = ξi and η = ξj for some
indexes i and j. By the support assumption these vectors commute with A[−R−1,∞), hence the
same holds for their inner product ⟨ξi|ξj⟩. We then obtain ⟨ξi|ξj⟩∈A(−∞,−1] by Condition 2.2.
Let us next check that X−is closed under left multiplication by elements of A−. From (2.1)
we have
aξi =
X
j
ξj ⟨ξj|aξi⟩,
hence we need to check that ⟨ξj|aξi⟩belongs to A−whenever a is an element of A−.
By Condition 2.3, the algebra A−is generated by A(−∞,−R−1] and A[−R−L,−1], hence it is
enough to check the claim for these algebras. If we have a ∈A[−R−L,−1], then a and ξi commute
by the support condition and we have ⟨ξj|aξi⟩= ⟨ξj|ξi⟩a. If we have a ∈A(−∞,−R−1], then aξi
still commutes with A[−R,∞), hence by the above argument we again have ⟨ξj|aξi⟩∈A−.
