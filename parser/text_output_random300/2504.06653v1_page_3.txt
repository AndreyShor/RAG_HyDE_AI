Expected amplitude of
the axion-induced magnetic field at Eskdalemuir observa-
tory, normalized by the axion-photon coupling strength of
10−10 GeV−1. Following Eq. (2), this is obtained by sum-
ming the mode functions from the top panel, weighted by
the harmonic coefficients of geomagnetic field and vector
spherical harmonics, and evaluating at the observatory’s
location.
result, the resonant peaks have a finite amplitude, ap-
proximately bℓ∼5 for ℓ= 1 −6, unlike the idealized
case where the amplitudes exhibit a divergent behav-
ior.
Predictions of induced magnetic fields.
Given
the mode function bℓabove, the prediction of induced
magnetic field strength is obtained from Eq. (2) by
convolving further the information on the geomagnetic
field configuration (Cℓm) and a specific geographic lo-
cation on the Earth.
The coefficients Cℓm are de-
scribed by the International Geomagnetic Reference
Field (IGRF) model with the harmonic coefficients up
to ℓ= 13 [24].
The bottom panel of Fig. 1 shows the predicted
magnetic field amplitude at the Eskdalemuir observa-
tory, UK, (55.31◦N, 3.21◦W), where long-term moni-
toring data up to 100 Hz is available (see below). Here,
we assume that the axions constitute the DM having
the local density of ρDM = 0.3 GeV cm−3, with the
coupling parameter of gaγ = 10−10 GeV−1. The in-
duced magnetic field is predicted to exhibit a peak at
ma ∼3 × 10−14 eV, corresponding to the peak fre-
quency fa ∼7.8 Hz for the radial mode function of
ℓ= 1. Additionally, a low-frequency plateau of |Ba| ∼
O(10−1) pT is observed, consistent with Ref. [17]. On
the other hand, at ma ≳10−13 eV, its amplitude is
sharply suppressed, reflecting the dipole nature of the
geomagnetic fields, where the higher multipoles are
sufficiently small.
The spectral features seen in the
bottom panel of Fig. 1 appear typical regardless of
the geographic location, though the overall amplitude
varies mostly with latitude, increasing near the equa-
tor, which reflects a toroidal field configuration [27].
Terrestrial magnetic field data. Based on the pre-
dictions above as a theoretical template, we use the
publicly-available magnetic field data to search for the
axion signature. Specifically, the data used here are
those measured at the Eskdalemuir Observatory [39]
during September 1, 2012 to November 4, 2022, which
are maintained at the British Geological Survey [40].
The data consist of two channels for the North-South
and East-West directions (CH1 and CH2) with the
sampling rate of 100 Hz, both of which are calibrated
within the range of 0.001–100 Hz. While the orienta-
tion of the measured magnetic fields helps distinguish
the signal from noise, the systematics and stability
are not well-understood. Therefore, we use only the
power spectral density (PSD), computed from the two
channels, CH1 and CH2.
The basic data analysis is summarized as follows.
First, a continuous dataset spanning more than one
month is extracted from the full data, which is then
divided into segments of length Tseg = 8 hrs.
Sec-
ond, each data segment is Fourier-transformed, and
its PSD is computed. The frequency bin size of each
segment is ∆fa ≃1/Tseg ≃3.5 × 10−5 Hz, roughly
corresponds to the bandwidth of the axion-induced
signal at fa = 35 Hz, above which the signal decays
rapidly as shown in Fig. 1. Axion-induced signals at
fa ≲35 Hz are well within a single frequency bin.
Considering the coherence time, the segment size of 8
hrs may not be an optimal choice but is chosen so as
to avoid unknown-cause short-duration transient noise
with huge amplitude of ∼108 pT that happens irreg-
ularly. Due to the transient noise, the fraction of the
data segments with good quality is roughly ∼10% of
the total number of the data segments, Nseg = 9909.
Constraining axion-photon coupling. Given the
PSD of the magnetic fields, we stack them with the
weight of the inverse of noise variance computed from
the spectrum at surrounding frequencies.
Then we
subtract the smooth component, obtained by apply-
ing a quadratic Butterworth filter with a sampling
frequency of 0.05 Hz. This allows the axion-induced
line signals to add constructively, while reducing other
components (magnetometer noise variance and the
Schumann resonance spectrum). Dividing by the sum
of the inverse-of-noise-variance weight for data seg-
ments, we obtain the weighted average differential
PSD, ˆs(fa).
The procedure above still leads to nu-
merous lines at integer-multiple frequencies, the ex-
act origin of which is unknown. Since these are likely
artificial, we remove the data surrounding these fre-
