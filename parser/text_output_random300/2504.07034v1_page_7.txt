LOW REGULARITY OF THE RIEMANN SOLUTIONS FOR THE ISENTROPIC EULER SYSTEM

Notice that the boundary integral in (3.11) is taken along a part of ∂Ω. Formally, the boundary
integral along the remaining part Γext of ∂Ωis expected to vanish by (3.10). Equation (3.11)
shows that
ρf(X)v · ν = 0
on Γext in the weak sense.
Furthermore, the integrand in the boundary integral in (3.11) is well-defined by assumption (i)
and Definition 3.1(v).
3. To prove (3.11), we introduce smooth approximations of (ρ, v). Since we work in the
bounded domain Ωand need the boundary condition v · ν = 0 on Γext and other properties
to hold for the approximating functions for the argument below, we first construct a specific
sequence of smooth approximations of (ρ, v).
We first extend v by the reflection across the straight boundary segments Γext
i
, i = 1, · · · , N1,
so that the normal component is extended by the odd reflection and condition (3.10) is used to
conclude that the extended function remains in H1, and the tangential component is extended
by the even reflection.
Denote by νext
i
the unit inner normal vector to Γext
i
with respect to Λ, i = 1, · · · , N1, respec-
tively, and by τ ext
i
the unit tangential vectors to Γext
i
.
For each r > 0 and i = 1, · · · , N1, we first define an extension of v from Nr(Γext
i
) ∩Ωacross
Γext
i
by reflection. However, there is the following issue: Denote
W r
i :=

ξ −sνext
i
: ξ ∈Γext
i
, s ∈(−r, 0), ξ + sνext
i
∈Ω
	
,
the image of Nr(Γext
i
) ∩Ωunder the reflection across Γext
i
. We note that, if P0 = (0, 0) is a
common endpoint of Γext
i
and Γext
j
, and the interior angle θP0 of Λ at P0 is larger than π, i.e.,
θP0 ∈(π, 2π), then W r
i ∩W r
j ̸= ∅for any r > 0. Moreover, if θP0 ∈(3
2π, 2π), then W r
i ∩Ω̸= ∅
for any r > 0. Of course, in general, the extension of v by reflection across Γext
i
into W r
i does
not match with v in W r
i ∩Ωor with extension of v by reflection across Γext
j
in W r
i ∩W r
j , so the
region needs to be restricted.
In the case above, for each r > 0, we have
(W r
i ∩Ω) \ BLr(P0) = ∅,
(W r
i ∩W r
j ) \ BLr(P0) = ∅
for some L = L(θP0) ≥0.
(3.12)
In fact, this is true with L = cosec θP0 if θP0 ∈(π, 2π) and L = 0 if θP0 ∈(0, π]. Also, there
exists r1 > 0 such that, for i = 1, · · · , N1,
Γext
i
∩B(L+1)r1(P0) = ∅
if P0 is not an endpoint of Γext
i
.
(3.13)
Now, for each r ∈(0, r1], define
V r
i := W r
i \ BLr(P0),
which is an open connected set. We extend v to V r
i by
v(ξ −sνext
i
) := −(v · νext
i
)(ξ + sνext
i
)νext
i
+ (v · τ ext
i
)(ξ + sνext
i
)τ ext
i
(3.14)
for all ξ ∈Γext
i
and s ∈(0, r) such that ξ + sνext
i
∈Ω\ BLr(P0). From the definitions of W r
i
and V r
i , since segment Γext
i
lies on the line passing through P0, the expression above defines
v on the whole region V r
i .
Also, it follows that, for all ξ ∈Γext
i
and s ∈(0, r) such that
ξ + sνext
i
∈Ω\ BLr(P0),
(v · νext
i
)(ξ −sνext
i
) := −(v · νext
i
)(ξ + sνext
i
),
(v · τ ext
i
)(ξ −sνext
i
) := (v · τ ext
i
)(ξ + sνext
i
),
(3.15)
that is, v · νext
i
is extended by the odd reflection, and v · τ ext
i
is extended by the even reflection
across Γext
i
.
Similarly, for each i = 1, · · · , N1 and r ∈(0, r1], we extend ρ to V r
i by the even reflection
across Γext
i
: For all ξ ∈Γext
i
and s ∈(0, r) such that ξ + sνext
i
∈Ω\ BLr(P0),
ρ(ξ −sν) := ρ(ξ + sν),
