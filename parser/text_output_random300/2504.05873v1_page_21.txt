Figure 7: Constraints on ALP derivative couplings from LEP searches for Z →3γ from
direct ALP production either via on-shell or off-shell photons (purple), see text for details.
Also shown are the limits from perturbative unitarity (gray), which always dominate over
analogous constraints on pseudoscalar couplings. Note that for ma ≤mπ0, the bounds are
slightly stronger than above, due to highly collimated photons looking like the forbidden
Z →γγ decay, see ref. [48] for more details.

They are accidentally of the same size as the
constraints from Z boson decays, since

The resulting constraints on the lepton couplings in the derivative scenario are shown in
the (ma −Cℓ/Λ plane) in figure 7 for all three individual lepton couplings as well as the
universal case, with the limits from perturbative unitarity shown in grey.
