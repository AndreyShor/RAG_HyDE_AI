to a fully relaxed static framework configuration for a
particular R with the equilibrium framework positions
shifted by rH, reminiscent of the quasistatic NEB formu-
lation. Therefore, we can view the final term in Eq. (11)
as the dynamic correction to the static NEB result.
At this point, we have a formal solution for the frame-
work motion, having avoided solving Eq. (3) for an in-
finitely large number of degrees of freedom. In fact, be-
cause our main goal is the particle trajectory, we can
focus only on framework atoms that are sufficiently close
to the particle to exhibit a non-negligible force, making
the size of r finite. Unfortunately, even with this simpli-
fication, the expression for r involves a memory integral.
Therefore, our next goal is to convert this expression into
an approximate time-local form.
We start by noting that, for a system containing A
atoms per unit cell, the eigenvectors εj are
εj =

(12)
where N is the number of unit cells in the system, qj
is the crystal momentum corresponding to the mode j,
Ln is the coordinate of the nth unit cell, and ηj is a 3A-
dimensional eigenvector of the dynamical matrix [27].
To proceed,
we assert that low-frequency,
long-
wavelength (small qj) modes play the dominant role
in the response kernel in Eq. (10).
This low-energy
phonon dominance is due to suppressed coupling to high-
frequency modes: the Ω2
j in the denominator. Moreover,
even though the number of modes grows with frequency
due to the increasing phase space, their short wavelength
makes them much more susceptible to destructive inter-
ference. This assertion yields two consequences. First,
we neglect the phase difference between all the unit cells
close to the mobile ion and replace eiLn·qj →1 in εj.
Second, the true form of the high-energy dispersion is
unimportant, allowing us to linearize the spectrum.
To linearize the spectrum, we start with the dynamical

L. Next, we write D(q) →D0(θ, ϕ) + q2D1(θ, ϕ), where
θ and ϕ are the polar and azimuthal angles of q, respec-
tively. The three zero-frequency eigenstates of D0(θ, ϕ)
are then labeled by the angles and the acoustic branch in-
dex u: ηu,θ,ϕ. Because the perturbation term q2D1(θ, ϕ)
is second-order in q, the eigenstates ηu,θ,ϕ are unchanged
up to the first order in q. The frequency, on the other
hand, is q

D1(θ, ϕ) and q

where V is the unit cell volume, ρ = m/V is the material’s

The maximum momentum Q is similar to the cutoff ap-
pearing in the Debye model for a linearized spectrum. In
the last line, we took the limit Q →∞to get the time-
local expression. Physically, this approximation means
that the relevant dynamics of the system are substan-
tially slower than the fastest mode. The 3 × 3 matrix L
gives the approximate time-local response in the linear-
spectrum approximation.
