Figure 7: Ground truth snapshots for the 3D cylinder case. Top (left to right): streamwise
velocity and normal velocity components. Bottom: spanwise velocity components.
Figure 8: Temporal evolution of the spanwise velocity component (w) for the 3D cylinder
with the data collected at a representative point in the wake of a cylinder.
The third test case involves an experimental study of the turbulent wake flow behind
a circular cylinder, as presented by Mendez et al. [56]. The experiment utilized
Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) data obtained in the low-speed wind tunnel at
the Von Kármán Institute, offering a realistic dataset with inherent noise due to
measurement uncertainties.
The cylinder used in the experiment has a diameter of d = 5 mm and a length of
L = 200 mm. The wind tunnel has an exposed measurement area of approximately
70 mm × 26 mm.
The dataset focuses on steady-state one, where the Reynolds
number is around 2600. The experimental domain is represented with nx = 111
points in the streamwise direction and ny = 301 points in the normal direction. The
data set captures two velocity components (nvar = 2): the streamwise velocity (u)
and the normal velocity (v). Measurements were collected over nt = 4000 snapshots,
with ∆t = 0.33 s.
This dataset provides an additional layer of complexity for the validation of numer-
