Figure 5 Sketch of the 3D NLSE with all terms contribut-
ing the dynamics adapted from (Aladjidi, 2023). From left
to right: interactions or self-defocusing, kinetic energy along
(x, y) or diffraction, potential energy or waveguiding, kinetic
energy along t or dispersion, rigid drift or group velocity. This
last term disappears in the co-moving frame as explained in
the text.
where we reintroduced the loss, potential (taken indepen-
dent of z), and nonlinear terms, assuming that they do
not depend on t.
The term
i
vg
∂
∂t in Eq. (52) is known as a rigid drift and
can be removed by a change of variable to the co-moving
frame: t′ = t −
z
vg , E(z, t) = E(z, t′).
Note that here
(and in later variable changes) we keep the notation E
for E(z, t′), even though it is a new quantity: the field
envelope in the co-moving frame.
The derivative over z is computed using the chain rule:

is known in optics as a retarded time frame and leads to:

Conceptually, the fluid of light becomes a 3D+1 system
where the propagation axis z still acts as an effective evo-
lution parameter (analogous to time) and the third spa-
tial dimension being the time t′ in the reference frame of
the pulse. The mass m⊥= k0 in the transverse plane is
still due to diffraction, and a mass in the temporal di-
rection mt = −1
D0
is introduced due to the group velocity
dispersion.
B. Mapping the 3D+1 NLSE and the GPE
We now map the 3D+1 NLSE to the GPE using the
same approach as in Section II.C. We use a similar change
of variable (but in the co-moving frame): τ = z
c , ζ =
vgt−z , E(z, t) = E(τ, ζ) and we multiply by ℏto recover
the dimension of an energy:

where we defined the analogous mass in the transverse
plane as ¯m⊥= ℏk0/c, an the mass along the ζ-axis as
¯mζ = −ℏ/cv2
gD0. The terms ¯V , ¯γ and ¯g are defined the
same way as in Section II.C.
In Eq. 55, the mass is anisotropic. But since it appears
only in the kinetic energy terms, we can rescale the ζ axis
once more to eliminate this anisotropy, at the expense of
modifying the definition of momentum along the ζ-axis.
This rescaling is introduced as:
ζ′ ≡

leading to an isotropic form for the 3D+1 NLSE:

E(x, y, ζ′),
(57)
with ¯m = ℏk0/c. Note that in Eq. (55) and Eq. (57), the
terms ¯g are proportional but not equal since |E|2 depends
on the rescaling. This will become clear in the next step
of the derivation with the proper normalization of |E|2.
We decomposed these two variable changes for clarity,
but the final change from t to ζ′ could have been intu-
ited from our previous remark on the kinetic energy. The
overall rescaling is indeed the square root of the ratio of
the mass along the time-axis and the mass in the trans-
verse plane:
ζ′ =

t′.
(58)
In 3D, there is a final step that can be done to complete
the mapping with the GPE. The electric field envelope
E(x, y, ζ′) can be normalized to be of the same dimen-
sion as a wavefunction ψ(x, y, ζ′), in order to obtain the
interaction coefficient ¯g3D with the same dimension as in
the GPE.
We first convert the electric field E(x, y, t′) into a photon
density |ψ|2 along (x, y, t′) by dividing the intensity I by
the energy ℏω0 of one photon:
|E(x, y, t′)|2 =
