FIG. 9.
Components f(q) from Equation 1 for bonds shown in panel (a) of Figure 4. These components weighted and
multiplied by the magnetic form factor yield the model shown in panels (a, c) in Figure 1.
FIG. 10.
Fits to estimated χ′′(ω) from T=1.7 K using Equation 4. Using independent DHO and sigmoid components, there
appears to be a signature consistent with a ∼1.1 meV energy gap. Note that the estimated χ′′(ω) derives from removing
q-dependent signals from bond correlations and is the best estimate of
R
dq χ′′(q, ω). Hence, this indicates the existence of an
“average” gap over all q.
