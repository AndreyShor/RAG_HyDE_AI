Abstract:
In this work, we explore primordial black holes (PBH) formation scenario
during the post-inflationary preheating stage dominated by the inflaton field. We consider,
in particular, a model-independent parametrization of the Gaussian peak inflationary power
spectrum that leads to amplified inflationary density fluctuations before the end of inflation.
These modes can reenter the horizon during preheating and could experience instabilities
that trigger the production of PBH. This is estimated with the Khlopov-Polnarev (KP)
formalism that takes into account non-spherical effects. We derive an accurate analytical
expression for the mass fraction under the KP formalism that fits well with the numerical
evaluation. Particularly, we focus on ultra-light PBH of masses MPBH < 109g and study
their evolution and (possible) dominance after the decay of the inflation field into radiation
and before the PBH evaporation via Hawking radiation. These considerations alter the
previous estimates of induced gravitational waves (GWs) from PBH dominance and open
new windows for detecting stochastic GW backgrounds with future detectors.
