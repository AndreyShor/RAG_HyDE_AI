In section 4.1, we show this analytically, to leading order in the λ-expansion we set up
in the beginning of section 2. Then, in section 4.2, we give numerical evidence, for N = 3,
r = 2, k = 1 that, starting from a random configuration, constant field strength fractional
instanton solutions never appear in our numerical minimization of the action for a tuned-T4
with ∆(2, 1, 1) = 0.20
That our findings make sense follows from the fact that with gcd(k, r) ̸= r, the number
of constant holonomies of the constant-F solution is only 4 gcd(k, r), which is strictly smaller
than 4r, the number required by the index theorem. As we show, by studying the leading non-
trivial order of the λ-expansion, we find that precisely the missing number of 4r −4 gcd(k, r)
new moduli appear. Unfortunately, the λ-expansion is (in contrast to the all-orders inductive
argument of section 3.1) difficult to pursue beyond the leading order; hence determining the
global structure of the moduli space in this case remains beyond our scope here.
Further below, in section 4.4 we also give a general argument for the case of Q = r/2
instantons for SU(2) on the tuned T4, for any natural r > 1, determining the number of
moduli.
4.1
Leading-order analytic study of the moduli space for gcd(k, r) ̸= r
Our discussion follows the steps we used in section 3.1. We begin with (2.21) and consider
The O(λ0) equations:
The equations for S in (2.21) clearly imply that S(0) ω,k,ℓare all constant and the boundary
conditions determine S(0)ℓ= 0, while the rest is given in terms of the 4gcd(k, r) allowed
holonomies ϕµ C′ obeying (2.10), exactly as in eqn. (3.2).
On the other hand, the solution of the equation for W(0) k×ℓin (2.21), derived in [1],
involves a larger number, r/gcd(k, r), of functions Φ(p) (A.5) and, as per eqn. (A.3), reads:

As in section 3.1, we still have that, as per (A.2), W(0)k×ℓ

The number of undetermined complex constants C2,4 is still 2r, equal to the number of values
[C′ + pk]r can take for C′ taking k integer values and p taking r/gcd(k, r) ones. We now
continue to
The next, O(λ), equation for S:
20Numerically, we are only able to find constant-F backgrounds by starting the minimization algorithm with
a lattice configuration determined by discretizing the analytic constant-F background (2.7, 2.8).
