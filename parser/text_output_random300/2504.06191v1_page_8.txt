Fig. 4 (a) Abundances for two kilonovae, one with 1.2 Mʘ ejecta and one for 1.5 Mʘ ejecta, (b) r-
process and s-process abundances for elliptical and spiral galaxies with and without neutrino 
masses.  
In Fig. 4 (b) we show the galactic abundances for the r-process and s-process yields for elliptical 
and spiral galaxies with and without neutrinos. The elliptical galaxies show a rapid early 
enrichment phase, especially for the r-process in the first Gyr, followed by a steady decline. The 
neutrino masses significantly reduce the peak values and early production which is followed by a 
rapid decay.  The s-process is similar and slightly slower with a smaller reduction due to the 
neutrino masses. In the spiral galaxies the enrichment is slower but richer with a higher peak 
followed by a much slower decline, where again the massive neutrinos reduce the overall 
production at peak values, and significantly at later times.

Fig. 5 In (a) we show the metallicity as a function of time for each galactic type with and without 
massive neutrinos and in (b) we compare the MvdW massive neutrino model to an observational 
data set and similar metallicity calculations.  
In Fig (5) we analyze metallicity [Fe/H] evolution across galaxy types with and without massive 
neutrinos. This comparison demonstrates the impact of neutrino masses causing slower metal 
production and delaying enrichment for each galaxy type where the most pronounced effect is 
for spiral galaxies. In all cases, when compared to observational data, the massive neutrino
