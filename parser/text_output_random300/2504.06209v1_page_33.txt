called the output distribution. Note that the upper bound in eq. (G1) can be positive, negative, or zero. In particular,
if the expected extracted work W is negative, realizing the isothermal process requires work, if it is positive, work
can be gained.
If an agent implements an isothermal process such that the expected extracted work equals the upper bound in
eq. (G1), we say that the agent is Landauer efficient, in reference to Landauer’s bound on the erasure of one bit,
which is a special case of eq. (G1).
Based on the assumption that eq. (G1) holds, we will derive an upper bound on the work an agent agtM can expect
to extract by undergoing a percept-action loop with an environment env.
Let agtM →
←env =

Θagt, pagt

be a percept-action loop with identical action and percept alphabets A = S
and memory alphabet M of the agent.
Then, based on eq. (G1), the work an agent can expect to extract by
implementing Θagt in between rounds (channel uses) t and t + 1 is upper bounded by
Wt→t+1 ≤H (At+1, Mt+1) −H (St, Mt) .
(G3)
Taking the Ces`aro limit (for a definition, see eq. (A14)), we find an upper bound on the expected extracted work per
round:
⟨Wt→t+1⟩t ≤⟨H (At+1, Mt+1) −H (St, Mt)⟩t .
(G4)
It is convenient to regroup terms in the Ces`aro sum on the right-hand side of this expression:
⟨H (At+1, Mt+1) −H (St, Mt)⟩t = lim
n→∞

(G8)
where in eq. (G6) we added H (A0, M0) inside the Ces`aro limit which does not change the result because it vanishes
as n →∞.
Then, we can rewrite the argument of the Ces`aro limit using twice the definition of conditional entropy:
H (At, Mt) −H (St, Mt) = H (At|Mt) + H (Mt) −H (St|Mt) −H (Mt)
(G9)
= H (At|Mt) −H (St|Mt) .
(G10)
We define
Wt(agtM →
←env) := H (At|Mt) −H (St|Mt)
(G11)
as the extractable work for round t and
W(agtM →
←env) := ⟨H (At|Mt) −H (St|Mt)⟩t
(G12)
as the work rate, the a.m. extractable work (both in units of kBT ln 2).

Existence of Landauer-efficient agents
The bound on expected extracted work for a single isothermal implementation of a transition matrix, eq. (G1), can
be reached using efficient protocols. These protocols typically have idealized requirements such as arbitrary energy
functions or infinite timescales; see for example [19] for a protocol based on over-damped Brownian motion in a
controllable energy landscape.
In the following we will outline, for any percept-action loop agtM →
←env and provided that such idealized protocols
are available, how an implementation for agtM can be found which extracts all a.m. extractable work, eq. (G12) using
only finite memory. Such agents will be called Landauer efficient.
