Stable convergence of random measures. We now recall some facts about stable convergence of
random measures. This type of convergence interpolates to some extent between convergence in law
and convergence in probability. We refer to the monographs [JS03,HL15] and references therein for
more details on stable convergence in a more general setting.
We consider a collection (νt)t≥0 of M+(X)-valued random variables defined on a common probability
space (Ω, P) and a M+(X)-valued random variables ν defined on a possibly larger probability space.
We also fix a σ-algebra Σ over Ω.
Definition 3.6. We say that νt converges Σ-stably to ν ∈M+(X) as t →∞, if (Z, νt) ⇒(Z, ν) for
all Σ-measurable random variables Z.
Remark 3.7. If Σ is the trivial σ-algebra, then this coincides with convergence in law. Conversely,
if Σ is the full σ-algebra of the probability space Ωand the limiting random variable is defined on
(Ω, P), then this corresponds to convergence in probability.
Given a Polish space Y and a Y-valued random variable Y, we have the following result that
characterises σ(Y)-stable convergence.
Lemma 3.8. Consider the same setting described above. Then νt converges σ(Y)-stably to ν if and
only if (Y, νt) ⇒(Y, ν) as t →∞.
Proof. See for instance [HL15, Exercise 3.11].

Some properties of ⋆-scale invariant fields
Let X be a ⋆-scale invariant field as defined in (1.2) and with seed covariance function K satisfying
assumptions (K1) – (K2). Recalling the covariance structure (1.4) of X, we point out that there exists
a smooth function g : Rd × Rd →R such that, for all x, y ∈Rd,
E[X(x)X(y)] = −log |x −y| + g(x, y) ,
or in other words, X is a log-correlated Gaussian field. Thanks to [JSW19], it is known that a
partial converse is true, i.e., given a log-correlated Gaussian field X with covariance of the form
−log|x −y| + g(x, y) for some function g : Rd × Rd →R satisfying certain (weak) regularity
assumptions, then X can be decomposed as X = X⋆+ L, where X⋆is a ⋆-scale invariant field, L is a
centred Gaussian field with H¨older regularity, and X⋆and L are jointly Gaussian.
We recall that (Xt)t≥0 denotes the martingale approximation of X as defined in (1.3). For every t ≥0,
we recall the definition (1.5) of the σ-field Ft. The following properties are straightforward to check:
1. For 0 ≤s < t, the random field Xs,t is independent from the σ-field Fs.
2. For any fixed x ∈Rd, the process (Xt(x))t≥0 has the law of a standard Brownian motion.
3. For 0 ≤s < t, the following scaling relation holds
Xs,t(·)
law= Xt−s(es·) .

We now introduce a field that will play an import role in what follows. We recall that K is the (unique)
positive definite function such that the convolution of K with itself equals K.
Definition 3.9. For ξ′ a space-time white noise on Rd × R+, we define the field Z∞on Rd by letting,
