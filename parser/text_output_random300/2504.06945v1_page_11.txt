D>(x1, x2) = −i ⟨ϕ(x1) ϕ(x2)⟩,
D<(x1, x2) = −i ⟨ϕ(x2) ϕ(x1)⟩,

Dt(x1, x2) = Θ(t1 −t2) D>(x1, x2) + Θ(t2 −t1) D<(x1, x2) ,

Here, x1 ≡(r1, t1, ) and x2 ≡(r2, t2) (using the condensed notation for the spacetime coordinates), and ψ(x) [ϕ(x)] is
the the fermionic [bosonic] quantum field. The Green’s functions shown above are related to the retarded (GR), advanced
(GA), and Keldysh (GK) Green’s functions in the following way:
GR = Gt −G< = G> −G¯t ,
GA = Gt −G> = G< −G¯t ,
GK = G< + G> ,
(A6)
where, for notational convenience, we have dropped the functional dependence on (x1, x2). A straightforward manipulation,
using Eq. (A6), leads to

Analogous relations hold for the critical bosons as well. The fermionic and bosonic self-energy matrices, ˜Σ and ˜Π, have
an 2 × 2 matrix structure analogous to Eq. (A1). They follow the Dyson equations, viz.

Here, the symbol ◦represents multiplication both in spacetime and matrix structure [for example, we have A ◦B =

which evaluate to

where ξk is the bare fermionic dispersion.
Appendix B: Equilibrium Green’s functions and spectral properties
For a generic system of fermions and bosons in equilibrium, the Fourier-space Green’s functions can be expressed as
follows:
G<
0 (ωk, k) = i f0(ωk) A(ωk, k) ,
G>
0 (ωk, k) = −i [1 −f0(ωk)] A(ωk, k) ,
D<
0 (ωk, k) = −i nB(ωk) B(ωk, k) ,
D>
0 (ωk, k) = −i [1 + nB(ωk)] B(ωk, k) ,
(B1)
where f0(ω) = (eβ ω + 1)−1 and nB(ω) = (eβ ω −1)−1 are the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions functions,
respectively, at temperature T = 1/β. While A(ωk, k) and B(ωk, k) denote the spectral functions for the fermions and
bosons, respectively, we have used a subscript “0” is used to denote the equilibrium state.
Applying Eq. (A8) to the equilibrium condition, the standard expressions for the retarded Green’s functions turn out
to be
GR
0 (ωk, k) =

which include the effects of the retarded self-energies, ΣR

functions through A(ωk, k) = −2 Im[GR
0 (ωk, k)] and B(ωk, k) = −2 Im[DR
