Figure S4. Determination of the electron-transfer TR profile. (a) The contour plot of 
steady RC spectrum as a function of doping in WS2, around the resonances of MoSe2 
and WS2. 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸 is fixed at 7 V. (b) The linecuts of the RC spectra around the AW 
resonance at the initial doping regime, indicated by the dashed box in (a). (c) The 
contrast between the RC spectrum with electron doped WS2 (RC𝑉𝑉) and that with neutral 
WS2 ( RC𝑉𝑉0  and 𝑉𝑉0 =1.089 V), defined as ൫RC𝑉𝑉−RC𝑉𝑉0൯൫RC𝑉𝑉0 + 1൯

, which is 
equivalent to the electron-transfer TR profile. The inset shows normalized electron-
transfer TR profiles with varying electron doping in WS2. (d) The maximum of the 
electron-transfer TR profile as a function of 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷. 
6.2 The temperature-increase TR profile 
To obtain the TR profile induced by lattice temperature increase, we measured steady 
RC spectra of the AW resonance with increasing sample temperature, as shown in 
Figure S5a. Both WS2 and MoSe2 are kept at neutral. As the temperature increases from 
10 to 31 K, the AW resonance shows red shift, along with slightly decreased magnitude. 
The TR profile is given by ൫RC𝑇𝑇−RC𝑇𝑇0൯൫RC𝑇𝑇0 + 1൯
ൗ
, shown in Figure S5b. RC𝑇𝑇 
and RC𝑇𝑇0 are the RC spectra at elevated temperature 𝑇𝑇 and base temperature 𝑇𝑇0 (≈ 
10 K), respectively. The maximum of the TR profile increases linearly with temperature 
increment 𝛥𝛥𝑇𝑇 that is defined as 𝑇𝑇−𝑇𝑇0, shown in Figure S5c. The normalized TR 
profiles obtained with various 𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥 have similar shapes, except slight red shift at higher 
𝑇𝑇 (the inset of Figure S5b).
