2.4. Results and a conjecture.
Proposition 6. Let G with vG ≥1 be a connected vacuum color graph for the group SU(N) and let RG(N)
be its color reduction. Let eG and fG be the number of edges and oriented cycles in G, respectively.
(1) RG(N) is divisible by N 2 −1.
(2) If G has a subgraph as depicted in Figure 8, then RG(N) = 0.
(3) The polynomial RG(N) ∈Z[N, 1
N ] has low degree ≥−hG + 2. If G has a fundamental vertex,
then deg(RG(N)) ≤hG, otherwise deg(RG(N)) ≤hG + 1.
(4) The polynomial RG(N) has parity fG + eG,
(15)
RG(−N) = (−1)fG+eGRG(N).
Proof. (1) Because vG ≥1, the graph G has at least one non-oriented edge. We open G at this edge, see
Example 5 (1), and calculate the reduction as a polynomial in Z[N, 1
N ]. The result follows from (11).
(2) By anti-symmetry of adjoint vertices, see Figure 2, permuting the two left vertices in Figure 8
reproduces the graph with a minus sign comming from the three right vertices.
(3) If G has no adjoint vertex, then one third of its edges is non-oriented. The reduction of a non-
oriented edge with (9) produces one factor of 1/N and may disconnect the graph. After all non-oriented
edges are reduced, we have eG/3 powers of 1/N (bar cancellations). The number of oriented self-loops
(with value N) is between one and eG/3 + 1. From (8) we obtain vG = 2eG/3; from (7) we get eG/3 =
hG −1. The low degree of RG(N) is therefore ≥−hG + 2 and deg(RG(N)) ≤hG.
With the first equation in Figure 3 we can replace an adjoint vertex that is attached to an oriented
chain by a fundamental vertex. The reduction does not change eG, vG or cG. By (7) it also fixes hG. If
G has an adjoint and a fundamental vertex, then (because G is connected) there exists an adjoint vertex
that is attached to a fundamental vertex. By induction over the number of adjoint vertices using the
above reduction, we obtain a low degree ≥−hG + 2 and a degree ≤hG.
If G has no fundamental vertex, we use (9) to produce three fundamental vertices. The loop order of
G increases by one.
(4) We can calculate the reduction only by using (4) (to eliminate all adjoint vertices) and (9) (to
eliminate all non-oriented edges).
In both terms of (4), we obtain fG 7→fG + 1, eG 7→eG + 3. So, fG + eG 7→fG + eG + 4 and the parity
does not change.
In the first term of (9) we obtain the map fG 7→fG ± 1 (depending on whether or not the oriented
chains are from the same oriented cycle), eG 7→eG −3. So, fG + eG does not change modulo 2.
In the second term of (9) we obtain the map fG 7→fG, eG 7→eG −3. So, fG + eG changes modulo 2.
The coefficient 1/N is anti-symmetric, so that (15) remains valid.
Hence, it suffices to show (15) for complete reductions, which are a collection of oriented self-loops
(with e◦= 0). A union of n oriented loops has the reduction N n with n = fG = fG + eG.
□
The graph in Figure 8 is only the smallest example of a subgraph that renders the color factor zero.
If G1 (G2) is a (non-)oriented cycle with hG1 −1 (hG2 −1) parallel chords, then we obtain from
repeatedly using the second line in Figure 5 that
