Figure 8.
This figure presents the DRW PSDs obtained
from γ-ray and ASAS-SN observations, along with their 1σ
confidence intervals. The two shaded regions highlight biased
regions due to observational limitations, such as finite length
and the mean cadence of the light curve. The regions with
orange star symbols represent the invalid areas in γ-ray PSD,
while the blue hatch line regions in PSD indicate limitations
imposed by the ASAS-SN light curve’s duration and mean
cadence.
tivistic jets, the emitting region is often simplified as a
”blob” with a characteristic size D. This size can be
constrained by the relation:
D ≲δ∆tobsc
1 + z
(12)
where δ is the Doppler factor of the relativistic jet, ∆tobs
is the observed variability timescale, z is the redshift of
the blazar, and c represents the speed of light.
Several studies (R. Hartman 1996; G. Ghisellini &
P. Madau 1996; G. Xie et al. 1998; J. Yang & J. Fan
2010) have suggested that γ-ray emissions originate
from a region located a few hundred Schwarzschild radii
(rg ≡GM∗/c2), where G and M∗are the gravitational
constant and black hole mass, respectively. The emis-
sion region is typically constrained to a size of r < 200rg.
J. Yang & J. Fan (2010) provided a relation to estimate
the lower limit of the black hole mass in terms of γ-ray
luminosity, redshift, and variability timescale, which is
defined as

A. Acharyya et al. (2023) reported the spectral pa-

αγ = 1.79 ± 0.14.
The estimated γ-ray luminosity is
∼1.18 × 1047 erg s−1 and the mass of the black hole
to be M∗> 1.42 × 108M⊙using the eq.’s (14) and (13),
respectively.
Additionally, H. Liu & J. Bai (2015) proposed a model
to determine the upper limit of the black hole mass
based on variability studies, which is briefly discussed
here.
In this model, a blob in the jet-production re-
gion initially has a size of D0 and expands to DR at a
distance Rjet from the central black hole. As the blob
