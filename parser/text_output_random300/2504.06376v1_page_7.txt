Quantum Combine and Conquer
Figure 2 An example instance of maxima set where n = 32 and h = 8 solved using our quantum
combine-and-conquer algorithm. Consecutive blocks of points are colored in alternating purple and
green, and the set T of tallest points in each group is circled. The maxima set of T is indicated
using solid circles, whereas tallest points that are dominated are circled in dotted lines. To illustrate
an example of the conquer step, we focus attention on the group S2 which is highlighted in orange.
In this group, the tallest y coordinate is indicated by T2, and R2 is the y coordinate of the tallest
point to the right of this group. Thus, the only points that need to be processed are the two points
not bound by any blue box. The points that are found in this local check are circled in green.
Figure 3 A demonstration of Algorithm 2 where we iteratively search for the maxima point
within block j given Tj and Rj. The left shows the state of the first iteration, and all points shown
are the contents of block j except for the one labeled Rj. Points are green if they are not dominated
by Tj or Rj and thus return 1 to the Boolean function f. Among these points, we search for the
lexicographic maximum point q and set this to be the new right boundary for the next iteration.
The first q to be discovered in the above instance is marked in blue. This is repeated until there are
no remaining green points.
Finally, the case where h is unknown can be handled using an approach where we start
with a small estimate of h, then repeat the procedure using h = 2h if we discover more than
h points. Thus, the running time forms a geometric sum that is ˜O(
√
nh). See Algorithm 3.
▶Theorem 2. There is a quantum algorithm for finding the maxima set of a presorted set
of n points in the plane in ˜O(
√
nh) time, where h is the size of the output.
Proof. The Grover searches for the tallest points in each block takes ˜O(h
p
n/h) = ˜O(
√
nh)
