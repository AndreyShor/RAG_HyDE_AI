where the last inequality is obtained using p1 ´ |ϑN|
log N q ď 1 in the numerator, RL
RN ď 1 in the
denominator, and RN „ log N

by (1.15). This completes the proof of (2.14).
□
Proof of Theorem 2.5. We are going to exploit the upper and lower bounds in (2.16).
We recall from (1.24) that log

Applying (2.14) then gives

and the same holds for E

The difference RLpφ, φq ´ R 1

assumption (2.20) on φN implies, since |ϑN| Ñ 8,

Since σ2

□
Remark A.2 (Sub-critical regime). The proof of Theorem 2.5 also applies to the
sub-critical regime (1.26) if we take ϑN „ ´p1 ´ ˆβ2q log N with ˆβ2 P p0, 1q. In this case
|ϑN|
log N Ñ p1 ´ ˆβ2q ą 0 and we must take into account second order terms in (A.4), namely

(A.6)
Since σ2

RN „ π ˆβ2
log N , the bounds in (2.16) yield (2.22).
Proof of Proposition 2.7. Recalling (2.6), we rewrite condition (2.20) as
ÿ
x,yPZ2
even
φNpxq φNpyq RLN px ´ yq “ 1
π log LN
WN
` op|ϑN|q .
(A.7)
To obtain our goal (2.23), we simply replace RLN px ´ yq in this sum by 1
π logp1 `
LN
1`|x´y|2 q
because their difference is uniformly bounded, see (2.9), and hence their contributions to
the sum differ by Op1q “ op|ϑN|q, which is negligible for the RHS of (A.7).
□
Proof of Proposition 2.8. We need to show that condition (2.24) implies (2.23).
We assume for simplicity of notation that zN “ 0. We then rewrite (2.24) as follows:
ÿ
|x|ď
b
W `
N
φNpxq “ 1 ´ op1q ,
sup

1
W ´
N
,
with W ˘
N :“ WN e˘tN ,
(A.8)
where we recall that 0 ď tN “ op|ϑN|q. Henceforth
If φN satisfies (A.8), then we can get a lower bound on the sum in (2.23) by restricting
to the ranges |x|, |y| ď
b
W `
N , which have probability 1 ´ op1q by the first relation in (A.8).
