Zebra striped cow with 
perfectly straight lines
Prompt:  
Cow covered in fine circuit board 
patterns with tiny microchips

Figure 11. Spectral and visual comparison of texture generation approaches. (a) Power spectrum analysis (log scale) computed on the
Objaverse subset, showing CasTex + DIPâ€™s reduced power in high-frequency components compared to standard CasTex . (b) Additional
examples showing texture generation results for two test prompts. CasTex produces rich, detailed textures while CasTex + DIP generates
simplified outputs lacking fine-grained details, directly corresponding to its high-frequency limitations observed in the spectral analysis.
