Where ϵD(t) and ϵV (t) are noise terms, and ρ2 and τ2 reflect the feedback
from the prevalence of pregnancy and substance abuse in the region to its
overall socioeconomic deprivation and violence.
There are interactions between individual agents’ behavior and their regional
environments. For example, an increase in regional violence may lead to an
increase in peer-group pressure for risky behaviors, further deteriorating regional
conditions. These feedback loops create emergent phenomena at the system
level.
To model these interactions:

Where η2 accounts for the influence of regional violence on peer-group
behaviors, linking the regional-level shocks with individual behavior at the
social network level.
The model tracks:
• Pregnancy rates: Both at the individual level and across regions.
• Behavioral evolution: How contraceptive use and substance abuse
evolve based on peer-group pressure and regional environments.
• Regional dynamics: Changes in socioeconomic deprivation, violence,
and education quality over time.
This enhanced agent-based model creates a multi-level feedback system
where teenage pregnancy, substance abuse, and other behaviors emerge from
interactions between individuals, their peer networks, and the socio-economic
environment. The complexity arises from the network effects, regional dynamics,
and feedback loops within and between these levels.
Each agent Ai is part of a social network G, with the following attributes:
• Pregnancy State yi(t): A continuous variable representing the preg-
nancy state of agent Ai at time t.
