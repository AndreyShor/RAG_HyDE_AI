Assume that for some p P r1, 8q and C ă 8 the following bounds hold:

(3.18)
Then pT ω
N qNPN is a tight sequence of random variables taking values in the space Cγ1
for any
γ1 ă γ ´ d
p.
Remark 3.6 (Topology of Hölder spaces). Given γ ă 0 and any distribution T P Cγ,
let us denote rrTssK,γ “ cK the best constant in the inequality (3.16). Defining the distance
dCγpT, T 1q :“
ÿ
KPN
2´K
rrT ´ T 1ssK,γ
1 ` rrT ´ T 1ssK,γ
,
we have that Cγ is a complete metric space, but it is not separable, see [FM17].
To ensure separability, one can define Cγ
0 as the closure of smooth compactly supported
functions C8
c
under the distance dCγ. One has the strict inclusion Cγ
0 Ă Cγ, however for any
˜γ ą γ one can sandwich C˜γ Ă Cγ
0 Ă Cγ (so the difference is “small” in a sense).
The results in [FM17] are formulated for the separable spaces Cγ
0 (called Cγ in that paper).
However, the tightness criterion in Theorem 3.5 applies also to the usual spaces Cγ, because
Cγ
0 is a closed subset of Cγ, hence compact sets in Cγ
0 are also compact in Cγ.
We now turn to the proof of Theorem 1.7, which is based on the following moment bounds.
Recall the initial conditions UBpz,Rqp¨q from (1.23) and the convergence in distribution (3.8).
Proposition 3.7 (Moment bounds). Fix t ą 0 and ϑ P R. Let βcrit
N
be in the critical
regime (1.19). For any h P 2N, ε ą 0, δ0 ă 8, there is a constant C “ Ct,ϑ
p,ε,δ0 ă 8 such that

(3.20)
Proof. In view of (3.8), the bound (3.20) follows by (3.19) and Fatou’s Lemma.
To prove the bound (3.19), we apply equation (6.1) in [CSZ23a, Theorem 6.1] for ψ ” 1
(we just exchange N, ˜N): given h P N and 1 ă p ă 8, there is a constant C1 “ C1pϑ, h, pq ă 8
such that, uniformly in large N, ˜N P N and integrable φ : R2 Ñ R, we have
