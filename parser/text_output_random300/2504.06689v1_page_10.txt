Infrared subtraction methods for differential cross sections
Fully differential higher-order calculations must retain the complete information on the final-
state kinematics, which includes regions of the real-emission phase space that are associated with
soft and/or collinear configurations and thus where the Matrix Elements can develop singular-
ities. While such infrared (IR) singularities must cancel with the explicit poles in the virtual
amplitudes for any IR-safe observable, this entails some level of integration of the unresolved
emission to expose the singularity. IR subtraction methods facilitate the explicit cancellation of
singularities to obtain finite cross sections,
dσ2→nNkLO = IRk(Ak
2→n, Ak−1
2→n+1, · · · , A0
2→n+k) ,
(1)
where the function IRk represents an infrared subtraction technique that leaves the kinematic
information for each particle multiplicity intact, and Ak
2→N denotes the amplitude for a 2 →N
particle process with k loops.
While full automation of NLO subtractions has been achieved, this is not yet the case
at NNLO. Nonetheless, tremendous progress has been made in differential NNLO calculations,
essentially completing all relevant 2 →1 and 2 →2 processes as well as several important
2 →3 processes. Nevertheless, the substantial computing times required for these results have
motivated the re-appraisal of subtraction schemes at NNLO, with the aims of streamlining them,
making them applicable to broader class of processes, and/or including previously ignored sub-
leading effects.
At the same time, there are ongoing efforts to revisit prior approximations
that could potentially limit the interpretation of theory–data comparisons (e.g., combination of
production and decay subprocesses, flavoured jet definition, photon-jet separation and hadron
fragmentation, on-shell vs. off-shell, etc.).
Lastly, we have observed remarkable progress in
the area of differential N3LO calculations with results being available for 2 →1 benchmark
processes.
– Antenna subtraction [130,131]:
Applicable to processes with hadronic initial and final states with analytically integrated
counterterms.
An almost completely local subtraction up to angular correlations that
are removed through the averaging over azimuthal angles. Applied to processes in e+e−,
deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), and hadron–hadron collisions: e+e−→3j [132, 133], (di-
)jets in DIS [134, 135], pp →(di)-jets [136, 137], pp →γγ [138], pp →γ + j/X [139],
pp →V +j [140–142], pp →H +j [143], pp →V H(+jet) [144–146], and Higgs production
in VBF [147]. Extensions to cope with identified jet flavours [144, 148–150], the photon
fragmentation function [151,152] and hadron fragmentation [153,154].
Recent refinements have focused on streamlining the construction of antenna functions by
reducing the number of spurious divergences [155–158] as well as the formulation of the
method in color space [159,160] allowing high-multiplicity processes to be computed beyond
the leading-color approximation in a semi-automated manner. Extensions to accommodate
fragmentation functions for identified hadrons have also been considered [153].
– Sector-improved residue subtraction [161–163]:
Capable of treating hadronic initial and final states through a fully local subtraction that
incorporates ideas of the FKS approach at NLO [164,165] and a sector decomposition [166]
approach for real radiation singularities [167–169]. Counterterms obtained numerically
