6.3
Boundary four-arm event
We now prove the upper bound in (1.7). We will prove the following lemma, which then implies
(1.7). Let us first define the following event. For y > x > 1 > s > ε > 0, let η be a chordal SLEκ
in H from −x to −y. Let τ1 be the first time that η hits Bε. Let σ1 be the first time after τ1 that
η hits ∂Bs. Let τ2 be the first time after σ1 that η hits Bε. Let
f
W+
4 (x, y, ε, s) := {τ2 < ∞}.
Lemma 6.5. Fix κ ∈(8/3, 4]. For each s ∈(0, 1), there exists y0 > x0 > 1, such that as ε →0,
P
 f
W+
4 (x0, y0, ε, s)
 ≲εξ+
4 (κ),
(6.17)
where the implicit constant depends on κ, s.
Proof. We explore Γ+ according to Exploration process 1, and use the notations therein. We fix
r = 2, for the quantity r in Exploration process 1. On the event E1, by Lemma 2.1, for s ∈(0, 1),
we have
Bε/4 ∩H ⊆f(Bε ∩H),
f(Bs ∩H) ⊆B4s ∩H.
(6.18)
Let E2 be the event that eγ (seen as a curve from f(a) to f(b)) first intersects Bε/4, then intersects
∂B4s, then intersects Bε/4 again. If both E1 and E2 hold, then E+
1 (ε, s) occurs. Therefore
P
E+
1 (ε, s)
 ≥P[E1 ∩E2] = E[P[E2 | Σ]1E1].
(6.19)
On E1, conditionally on Σ, eγ is a chordal SLEκ in H between f(a) and f(b).
Suppose that the lemma is not true, then there exists s0 ∈(0, 1), such that for all y > x > 1,
C > 0 and ε0 > 0, there exists ε ∈(0, ε0), such that P
 f
W+
4 (x, y, ε/4, s0)
 > Cεξ+
4 (κ). Letting
s := s0/4, y := −f(a), x := −f(b), we have
P[E2 | Σ] = P
 f
W+
4 (−f(b), −f(a), ε/4, 4s)
 > Cεξ+
4 (κ).
Putting it back into (6.19), we get
P
E+
1 (ε, s)
 ≥Cεξ+
4 (κ)P[E1].
(6.20)
On the other hand, by (1.3), there exists c0 > 0 (which depends on s, ε0, but not on C or ε) such
that P
E+
1 (ε, s)
 ≤c0εξ4. Combining it with (6.20) yields
c0εξ4 ≥CP[E1]εξ4.
This leads to a contradiction since P[E1] > 0 and we can choose C as big as we want. This completes
the proof.
We are now ready to prove the upper bound in (1.7).
