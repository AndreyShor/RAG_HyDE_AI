FIG. 1. Probing the resonant interaction between Rydberg Rb atoms and KRb molecules. (a) The resonant interaction is
established between the atomic states 98D5/2 and 99P3/2, matched to the molecular rotational transition N = 0 →N = 1. The
pair state detuning ∆, defined as ∆= ∆Ea(98D5/2 −99P3/2) −∆Em(N = 1 −N = 0), can be tuned with an external electric
and magnetic field. (b) Two-photon excitation scheme of Rb atoms to the 98D5/2 state via the 6P3/2 intermediate state, with
two lasers at 420 nm and 1011 nm. (c) Detection scheme of the KRb rotation state. We use a 4.4 GHz microwave pulse to drive
N = 1 molecules to the N = 2 state before ionization. The REMPI step consists of a 667 nm laser pulse transferring the KRb
molecules from X1Σ+, ν = 0, N = 2 to the electronic excited state B1Π, ν′ = 0, N ′ = 1, and a 532 nm laser pulse ionizing the
molecules. Compared to directly ionizing N = 1 molecules, this scheme reduced off-resonant ionization of background N = 0
KRb. (d) Experimental sequence for a single excitation-detection cycle. In each cycle, we turned off the ODT and applied the
Rydberg excitation pulse for 3 µs. The Rydberg atoms and KRb molecules interacted for 7 µs before we detected the products.
The timings were chosen to ensure the stabilization of Rydberg excitation and sufficient build-up of products. Following the
microwave and REMPI pulses, we increased the voltage on the in-vacuum electrodes to ionize the Rydberg atoms through field
ionization and extract both the Rb and KRb ions.

FIG. 2. Electric field tuning of resonant interactions between
molecules and Rydberg atoms. N = 1 molecules are mea-
sured using REMPI at B = 10 G. The data (blue circles) were
taken with the Rydberg excitation pulse on resonance, and
the background (orange squares) was measured with the pulse
70 MHz blue-detuned to the two-photon 5S1/2 to 98D5/2 tran-
sitions. No Rydberg excitation was observed for the 70 MHz
detuned case. All error bars represent shot noise. (Inset) Cal-

We probed the outcome of the interaction where we
expect Rydberg atoms to exchange an energy quanta
with nearby N = 0 molecules as the appearance of
N = 1 molecules (Fig. 2), which were ionized and de-
tected through a state-selective 1+1’ resonance-enhanced
multi-photon ionization (REMPI) scheme [35]. Shortly
afterward, we accelerated the KRb ions with an exter-
nal electric field onto a micro-channel plate (MCP) to
be counted. The residual Rydberg atoms were removed
through field ionization.
The excitation-detection step
was repeated 5000 times over 1 second for each experi-
mental cycle to allow the accumulation of statistics.
To demonstrate the resonant nature of the Rydberg
atom-molecule interactions, we tuned the pair state de-
tuning ∆= ∆Ea(98D5/2 −99P3/2)−∆Em(N = 1−N =
0) by varying the external electric field (Fig. 2). This
can be achieved because of the disparate dipole moments,
da = 20 kilo-Debye for atoms and dm = 0.57 Debye for
molecules [33], leading to a large differential DC Stark
shift between the 98D5/2 and 99P3/2 states and a neg-
ligible differential shift for the molecular states. As we
varied the electric field, the excitation laser frequency
was tuned accordingly to maintain the two-photon reso-
nance condition to the highest energy state in the 98D5/2
manifold. This excited state was chosen because it is the
only state with resonances above the minimum achiev-
able electric field at an applied magnetic field B = 10
G.
We note the application of the electric field and its
calibration were deliberate. First, we characterized the
