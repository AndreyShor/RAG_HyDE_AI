Given a set of high-level tasks that directly relate to the rooms
in a house, we can approximately recover similar entities to that of prior
scene graph construction approaches [14, 45]. For visualization clarity, we
only show the labels of the high-level tasks. The purple nodes mark the
subtasks and the red the associated objects.
