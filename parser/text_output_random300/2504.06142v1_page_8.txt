where Aµ(x) is the gauge connection.
Expansion of the connection on the generators of
ISO(1, 3) gives the expression:
Aµ(x) = eµ
a(x)Pa + 1
2ωµ
ab(x)Mab ,
(26)
where eµa and ωµab are identified as the component gauge fields for the translations and
Lorentz transformations respectively. By definition, the transformation of Dµ is covariant,
therefore, the transformation law for the gauge connection Aµ is given by:
δAµ = Dµϵ = ∂µ + [Aµ, ϵ] ,
(27)
where ϵ = ϵ(x) is a gauge transformation parameter, which, as an element of ISO(1, 3)
algebra, it may be written as an expansion on the generators:
ϵ(x) = ξa(x)Pa + 1
2λab(x)Mab ,
(28)
with ξa(x) and λab(x) being infinitesimal parameters. Combination of (26), (27) and (28)
leads to the expression of the transformation of the component gauge fields:
δeµ
a = ∂µξa + ωµ
abξb −λa
beµ
b ,
(29)
δωµ
ab = ∂µλab + λa
cωµ
bc −λb
cωµ
ac .
(30)
The corresponding field strength tensors, Tµνa and Rµνab, of the component fields, e and ω,
are obtained by the definition of the field strength tensor, Rµν, of Aµ:
Rµν = [Dµ, Dν] = ∂µAν −∂νAµ + [Aµ, Aν] ,
(31)
after its expansion on the generators:
Rµν = Tµν
aPa + 1
2Rµν
abMab .
(32)
Therefore, combining (26), (31) and (32), the expressions of the component tensors are:
Tµν
a = ∂µeν
a −∂νeµ
a −ωµ
abeνb + ων
abeµb ,
(33)
Rµν
ab = ∂µων
ab −∂νωµ
ab −ωµ
acων
b
c + ων
acωµ
b
c ,
(34)
where the above expressions coincide with the ones found for the torsion and curvature
two-forms in the vierbein formalism description of general relativity.
So far, the construction of the gauge-theoretic version of 4-d gravity is done in a straight-
forward way. Going further to the dynamical part of the theory, the obvious choice would be
an action of Yang-Mills type of the Poincar´e group. However, in order to claim a successful
relation between the four-dimensional gravity and a gauge theory, it is necessary to result
with the Einstein-Hilbert action, which is, of course, not of the usual Yang-Mills type, as
already mentioned. To proceed, let us note that the desired action has to be invariant un-
der the Lorentz transformations and not under the total Poincar´e symmetry. Moreover, the
distinct behaviour of the translations generators does not allow a full local gauge symmetry,
