The phase of the non-closed conditional path strongly depends on the initial and final states, defining the initial state
|n⟩and the final state |m⟩. The non-adiabatic corrections of AGP are discussed first. The non-adiabatic transition
probability amplitude:
cm(t) =
Z t
0
exp[i
Z t′
0
(Em −En)dτ] ˙λ ⟨m|∂λn⟩dt′
(S13)
With the introduction of AGP, it was corrected to
cm(t) =
Z t
0
exp[i
Z t′
0
(Em −En)dτ] ˙λ(i ⟨m|∂λn⟩−⟨m| Aλ |n⟩)dt′ = 0
(S14)
From (8), it showes that it completely suppresses the non-adiabatic term. We obtain that it does not affect the
system action and Berry connection according to the non-diagonality of AGP when the integral path is closed, further
reflecting the topological invariance.The cancellation cm(t) = 0 holds rigorously when the counterdiabatic potential
Aλ satisfies the adiabatic condition maxm̸=n |⟨m|Aλ|n⟩/(Em −En)| ≪1. For fast parameter sweeps (dλ/dt ≫1),
higher-order non-adiabatic terms (e.g., O( ˙λ2)) may arise. These can be suppressed by optimizing the AGP ansatz
via variational methods.For fast parameter sweeps (ϵ = | ˙λ|/|∆Emn| ∼1), the first-order AGP (Eq.
2) must be
supplemented by a second-order term:
H(2)
CD =
X
m̸=n
⟨m|∂λH|n⟩
(Em −En)3 |m⟩⟨n|.
This suppresses residual transitions of O(ϵ2), ensuring cm(t) ≈0 even for dλ/dt ≫1

QUASI-TOPOLOGY OF THE NON-CLOSED PATH
If the parameters are not closed, λ(t) ∈M, t ∈[0, T], the geometric phase of the system is no longer closed but the
properties of Berry connection are still valid. At this point Berry connection Aµ(λ) is defined as
Aµ(λ) = i⟨ψ(λ)|∂µψ(λ)⟩
(S15)
The action of the non-closed path cannot constitute a phase because it depends on the endpoint. Thus, there is
Sgeo =
Z T
0
Aµ(λ) ˙λµ dt
(S16)
where the AGP action reflects the parameter correction. The geometric and dynamic decompositions of the non-closed
path can be obtained
S = Sdyn + Sgeo,
Sdyn = −
Z T
0
⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩dt
(S17)
The geometric action depends on the ends of the path and is sensitive to the gauge transformation |ψ⟩→eiθ |ψ⟩:
Sgeo →Sgeo + θ(λ(T)) −θ(λ(0))
(S18)
The Berry phase conforms to Stokes’ theorem under the closed path:
γ =
I
Aµdλµ
(S19)
=
ZZ
s
Fµνdλµ ∧dλν
(S20)
where the modified Berry curvature is Fµν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ. The phase depends only on the closed path. However,
the geometric action of the non-closed path depends on the parameter endpoints and cannot be eliminated through
gauge transformation. We choose to introduce a relative geometric phase, and we will explain why this operation is
inevitable. Considering two paths C1 and C2 with the same start and end points in the parameter space,
∆Sgeo =
