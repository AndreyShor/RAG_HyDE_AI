What is a non-trivial upper bound on the secret key rate that can be extracted from a DI-QKD protocol?
Understanding upper bounds on key rates is crucial from a practical perspective, as it reveals the inherent
limitations of an entire class of protocols rather than focusing on individual protocols and analyzing them
in isolation.
This question was first posed by Kaur et al. [67], who introduced information-theoretic measures of
nonlocality, termed intrinsic nonlocality and quantum intrinsic nonlocality. They demonstrated that these
measures serve as upper bounds for DI-QKD protocols, specifically against no-signaling and quantum
adversaries, respectively. Instead of using intrinsic nonlocality, Arnon-Friedman et al. [290] examined
a closely related information-theoretic quantity known as intrinsic information, which they employed to
derive an upper bound on the key rates of DI-QKD protocols.
Winczewski et al. [291] initiated a systematic study of upper bounds on secret key rates within the
no-signaling DI scenario. They introduced a computable function, termed squashed nonlocality, as one
such bound. Their numerical analysis suggests that quantum devices with two binary inputs and two
binary outputs can extract only a limited amount of key. Moreover, they found that isotropic devices
with less than 80% of the Popescu-Rohrlich box weight are generally key-undistillable.
Since DI-QKD has a higher security demand than QKD, one has the trivial bounds rDI ≤rDD (rDD is
the key rate of a standard device-dependent QKD protocol). Christandl et al. [292] use this fact to find
an upper bound on a DI-QKD as follows: assume that the POVMs {Aa|x} and {Bb|y} are chosen such
that the key-rate r is optimal, there might be different measurement A′
a|x and B′
b|y and state ρ′ leading
to the same distribution
p(a, b | x, y) := Tr[(Aa|x ⊗Bb|y)ρ] = Tr[(A′
a|x ⊗B′
b|y)ρ′],
(142)
the above equality is shown as (M, ρ) ≡(M′, ρ′). Since the maximal achievable key rate for ρ is also
achievable for ρ′ (rDI(ρ) ≤rDI(ρ′) ) then combining it with rDI(ρ′) ≤rDD(ρ′) the following bound can
be obtained [292]
rDI(ρ) ≤sup
M
inf
(M′,ρ′)
(M,ρ)≡(M′,ρ′)
rDD(ρ′),
(143)
Consider that ρ is a PPT state ρΓ ≥0 (Γ denotes partial transpose) because the transpose of a POVM
element is a POVM element then one can find
rDI(ρ) ≤min{rDD(ρ), rDD(ρΓ)},
(144)
The significance of the above result, can be seen by an example. Consider the 2d × 2d state σd as
σd = 1

rDD(σ220) ≥0.98 and rDD(σΓ
220) ≤

210+1. Therefore, we see that whereas in QKD, the obtained bit in
this setting is secure, the upper bound tells us that this bit is not secure in a device-independent setting.
Therefore the state, and any of its parts, cannot be tested independently of the device. This example
can be also regarded as supported evidence for the revised Peres conjecture for DI-QKD in [290] which
states that bound entangled states cannot be used as a resource for DI-QKD.
Kaur et al. [293] develop the above bounds by going beyond PPT states and arrive at the following upper
bound for general DI-QKD protocols based on the relative entropy of entanglement [294]
rDI(ρ) ≤(1 −p)

(σNL,N)=(ρNL,M) ER(σNL) + p

where ρ = (1 −p)ρNL + pρL such that (σL, N), (ρL, M) ∈LHV where LHV denoted the set of devices
with locally realistic hidden variable models. For the CHSH-based protocols, with ω denoting the CHSH
violation, the following analogous upper bound can be obtained
rDI(ρ) ≤(1 −p)

ω(σNL,N)=ω(ρNL,M) ER(σNL),
