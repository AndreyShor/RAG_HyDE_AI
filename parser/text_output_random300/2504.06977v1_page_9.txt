Because the resonant interaction is between Rydberg atoms and KRb molecules, the Rydberg excitation linewidth
should not depend on the Rb atom density in the low atom density regime (‚àº1010/cm3) [37]. We experimentally
tested this by measuring the Rydberg excitation linewidths at different Rb atom densities. To do this, we removed
part of the Rb atoms inside the cloud with a microwave adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) pulse that transferred these
Rb atoms to the |F = 2, mF = 2‚ü©state, which was subsequently expelled by a resonant laser pulse. Meanwhile, we
kept the highest achievable KRb density of 4.29 √ó 1011/cm3 and the atoms and molecules on resonance as we varied
the Rb density. Overall, we found that the Rydberg excitation linewidth does not depend on the Rb density, as shown
in Fig. 7.

Dynamics under the dipole-dipole Hamiltonian
We modeled the energy exchange between a Rydberg atom and a KRb molecule by treating both species as
point dipoles interacting under the dipole-dipole Hamiltonian. We evaluated the operators over a basis composed
of the tensor product of the subspaces for the molecule and the atom. The molecular subspace was spanned by the
rigid rotor eigenstates {|N, MN‚ü©(N = 0, 1) (‚àíN ‚â§MN ‚â§N)}. The atomic subspace was spanned by the basis
{|L, mL, S = 1/2, mS‚ü©(L = 1, 2) (‚àíL ‚â§mL ‚â§L) (mS = ¬±1/2)}. Within this basis, the matrix element of the dipole
operator for the molecule can be evaluated with,

where Rn,L is the radial wavefunction for the Rydberg state, and q ranges from -1 to 1, corresponding to the different
spherical components of the dipole vector operator. Given that we are interested in operators represented by the
uncoupled basis, we use the appropriate Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to go from the coupled to the uncoupled basis.
In addition to the dipole-dipole coupling, the total Hamiltonian also includes the individual molecule and atom
terms,
H0 = HDD + Hatom + Hmol.

Because rotation is the only relevant degree of freedom for the molecules,
Hmol = BN2 = 2œÄ √ó 2.227 GHz √ó |N = 1‚ü©‚ü®N = 1|,

where B is the rotational constant of KRb molecules [33], and the second equality is evaluated in the chosen molec-
ular subspace. Within this approximation, we ignored the hyperfine structure within each rotational state as their
interaction strengths are on the order of 0.1 MHz, and are much weaker than the average dipolar interactions be-
tween Rydberg atoms and molecules. Therefore, we assumed different MN projections in the N = 1 manifold to be
energetically degenerate in the following calculations.
The atomic Hamiltonian includes the Coulombic, spin-orbit, Stark, and Zeeman terms, all of which were explicitly
included in the calculations because their energy scales are greater than the dipolar coupling. We used the ARC
Rydberg package [36] to calculate the Rydberg atom eigenstate energies and decompositions by diagonalizing the
Hamiltonian in the coupled basis with n ranging from 96 to 100 and L from 0 to 10, respectively. We used this larger
