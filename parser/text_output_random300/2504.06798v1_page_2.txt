FIG. 1. (a) hBN layer with V −
B defect (ball with arrow). The
hexagonal c-axis is perpendicular to the figure plane. Nitro-
gen atoms groups, N(1), N(2), N(3), are shown with gray
circles. N(1) and N(2) each contain 3 nitrogen atoms; N(3)
has 6 atoms. The in-plane orientation of the B field vector
(B ⊥c), making an angle φ with the direction of the nitrogen
dangling bond (denoted by the dashed line), is represented
by a solid black arrow.

was used.
Experiments were conducted using a W-
band ( 94 GHz) Bruker Elexsys 680 ESR spectrometer.
The electron spin echo (ESE)-detected ESR spectra were
recorded using the standard Hahn-echo pulse sequence
(π/2–τ–π–τ–ESE) with π = 48 ns and τ = 300 ns. The
π/2-pulse generates transverse magnetization, which de-
cays over time τ. The π-pulse refocuses spin packets, pro-
ducing a spin-echo signal. To probe nuclear spins we use
a standard Mims ENDOR pulse sequence π/2–τ–π/2–
πRF – π/2–τ–SSE [28]. The first two π/2 mw pulses in-
vert the electron spin population; the third π/2 pulse
generates the stimulated electron spin echo (SSE) signal.
Between the second and the third mw pulses, a radiofre-
quency πRF pulse is applied to invert the population of
the nuclear spin sublevels, inducing NMR transitions. All
experiments were conducted at a temperature T = 25 K.
The spectrum shown in Fig. 1(c) reveals two promi-
nent ESR signals that serve as clear signatures of the
V −
B defects, corresponding to magnetic dipole transitions
within the triplet spin system.
The signal separation,
∆B ≈255 mT, corresponds to the zero-field splitting
value D = ∆B/(2gµB) ≈3.57 GHz, where g = 2.00 is
the Lande g-factor and µB is the Bohr magneton. These
parameters confirm the spectroscopic characteristics of
the S = 1 V −
B defect [1, 25]. The spectrum also shows
that 532 nm excitation initializes the defect’s spin system
into the mS = 0 ground state via spin-selective intersys-
tem crossing. This is evident from the phase reversal of
the high-field ESR signal, which emits rather than ab-
sorbs microwave power.
We monitor the ESE signal intensity to study the 14N
nuclear spins while driving NMR transitions between
their spin sublevels. To analyze ESR and ENDOR data,
the following spin-Hamiltonian is considered:

4I(2I−1) describes the nu-
clear quadrupole interaction, where Cq = eQNVzz is the
quadrupole coupling constant related to the interaction
of the electric field gradient Vzz with the nuclear electric
quadrupole moment QN; η = (Pxx −Pyy)/Pzz quantifies
the deviation from axial symmetry. Sx,y,z and Ix,y,z are
the projections of the electron and nuclear spins, respec-
tively.
The corresponding energy level diagram describing the
V −
B
electron spin interacting with I = 1 14N nuclear
spins localized in the 2D hBN plane, is presented in Fig.
1(d). It is important to note that, due to the high D3h
symmetry of the V −
B defect, all in-plane nitrogen atoms
within each group (N(1), N(2), and N(3)) are equiva-
lent when the external magnetic field is oriented perpen-
dicular to the (0001) plane (B ∥c). Consequently, the
frequencies of the NMR transitions at a given orienta-
tion are independent of the number of nitrogen atoms
and can be treated as if they originate from the nu-
clear spin sublevels of a single 14N nucleus, as shown in
Fig. 1(d). For each group of equivalent nitrogen atoms,
six allowed NMR transitions (∆mI = ±1)are expected:
HF and NQ interactions between the nuclear spin sub-
levels in the mS = +1 and mS = −1 states, and two
