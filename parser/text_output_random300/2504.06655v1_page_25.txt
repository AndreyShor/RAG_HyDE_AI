Figure 2: a) Schematic for the four waves mixing in rephasing geometry, for 2-dimensional elec- 
tronic spectroscopy technique, where the signal is heterodyne detected using a local oscillator 
(LO). b) The double-sided Feynman diagram for rephasing pulse sequence. c) Cartoon of 2- 
dimensional electronic spectra, in comparison with its linear spectra for a coupled oscillator. d) 
Wave vector for rephasing geometry. In isotropic media kStatic will vanish and kdynamic=ksignal but 
at interface kstatic may not be zero and can contribute to the resultant signal or it can create Pstatic 
signal in the direction depending on (∆kz)
