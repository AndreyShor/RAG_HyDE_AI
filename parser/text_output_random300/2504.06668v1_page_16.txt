and exposure to violence. This model elucidates how minor perturbations in an
adolescent’s environment can precipitate disproportionately large shifts in re-
productive outcomes, underscoring the non-linear nature of fertility transitions.
The findings align with empirical research demonstrating that individual-level
exposure to instability, such as armed conflict, can alter fertility preferences
and behaviors. For instance, high-resolution georeferenced data from 25 sub-
Saharan African countries, combined with records of violent events from the
Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) and fertility data
from the Demographic and Health Surveys, reveal that localized exposure
to armed conflict is associated with reductions in both preferred family size
and recent childbearing (Thiede et al., 2020). However, while such effects are
pronounced at the individual level, they do not always translate into macrode-
mographic shifts when averaged across entire populations. This discrepancy
highlights the necessity of multi-scalar analysis, recognizing that catastrophic
effects may manifest distinctly at different demographic levels.
Existing fertility research in advanced societies, as reviewed by Balbo et al.
(2013), reinforces the importance of multi-level determinants. At the macro level,
economic cycles, policy measures, technological advancements, and cultural
shifts influence fertility rates, with recessions and economic uncertainty often
delaying childbearing, whereas policies such as parental leave and subsidized
childcare support fertility recovery. At the meso level, fertility is shaped by
social interactions, urbanization patterns, and social capital, as peer influences,
kin networks, and residential contexts play a fundamental role in reproductive
decisions. At the micro level, individual agency, partnership stability, gender
roles, and economic security directly shape fertility outcomes. While traditional
demographic models emphasize the cumulative impact of these determinants,
catastrophe theory introduces an alternative lens, suggesting that fertility
systems can undergo sudden, irreversible transitions when critical thresholds are
exceeded. This perspective is particularly salient in explaining the demographic
shocks induced by events such as wars, economic depressions, and pandemics,
as evidenced by the COVID-19-induced fertility downturn (Kearney and Levine,
2023).
The implications of this framework extend beyond theoretical demography,
offering practical insights for policymakers and researchers. Understanding
the conditions under which gradual fertility changes escalate into catastrophic
declines is crucial for designing resilient reproductive health policies. Empirical
studies integrating catastrophe modeling with demographic data can illumi-
nate early-warning signals for fertility crises, enabling proactive interventions.
Furthermore, interdisciplinary collaborations—drawing from systems biology,
complexity theory, and behavioral economics—can refine the model’s predictive
