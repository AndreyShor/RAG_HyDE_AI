shift-and-add disentangling results for KBe
Fig. B.1: Normalised ˆχ2 measurements for the RV semi-amplitudes KB of the narrow-lined stripped star (left) and KBe of the broad-
lined Be companion (right). Values of χ2 were determined with the shift-and-add disentangling technique from the Balmer Hδ and
Hγ, and the He I λ4026, 4144, 4388 and 4472 Å lines. Since the disentangling procedure is non-linear and introduces unrecognised
sources of error, we opted to normalise the derived χ2 values by multiplication with a scaling factor such that the root mean squared
error near the minimum is of order unity. Parabolic fits around the minimum yield best-fitting semi-amplitudes of KB ≃76±0.9 km/s
and KBe ≃5 ± 4 km/s, indicated by vertical dashed lines and shaded regions. 1 −σ uncertainties were determined as the intervals

Fig. B.2: Disentangled spectra of the broad-lined, Be star companion. The figure compares spectra disentangled using the shift-
and-add method for assumed Be star radial-velocity semi-amplitudes of 5, 10, and 20 km/s shown in dark, medium and light grey,
respectively. The cyan line shows the Be star spectrum obtained via the singular value decomposition (SVD) method of Seeburger
et al. (2024). Unlike the shift-and-add method, this technique determines RVs as part of the disentangling process and does not
require an input value of KBe. The inferred RVs imply a semi-amplitude of approximately KBe ≃5 km/s.
fit of both broadening mechanisms. It is apparent that the trian-
gular line profile shape is inconsistent with purely instrumental
broadening and also not well-reproduced only using rotational
broadening. However, the relative contributions of macroturbu-
lent and rotational broadening cannot be reliably disentangled.
We therefore only place an upper limit of vrot sin i ≤30 km/s on
the projected rotational velocity of the star.
Fig. E.2 displays the He I 4026 Å line of the disentangled
Be star spectrum. Over-plotted are Tlusty model spectra (Teff =
17 kK, log g = 4.0) with varying rotational broadening velocities
vrot sin i and fixed macroturbulent broadening of vmac = 50 km/s.
Appendix F: Temperature determination
The effective temperatures of the binary components were deter-
mined on the basis of the EW ratios of lines from different ioni-
sation states. In Figures F.1 and Fig. F.2, we show in detail the
different EW ratios underlying the temperature determination of
the narrow-lined, stripped star and the broad-lined Be star. We
measured the EWs by integrating the area of the spectral lines
under the continuum. For the Be star, the errors are estimated by
propagating the flux uncertainty of the disentangled spectrum.
For the B star, where EWs are measured from the observed spec-
tra, the error is determined as the standard deviation of the EW
measurements obtained from all available spectra.
Appendix G: MESA Set-up
The binary evolution models presented in Sect. 8 were computed
with version 24.03.1 of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar
Astrophysics code (MESA, Paxton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015, 2018,
2019; Jermyn et al. 2023) and using MESASDK version 23.10.1
(Townsend & Teitler 2013; Townsend et al. 2018; Townsend
2019; Christensen-Dalsgaard 2008; Blinnikov & Sorokina 2004;
Blinnikov et al. 2006; Baklanov et al. 2005; Smolec & Moskalik
2008). The parameter values for all models are summarised in
Table G.1. The models were computed for initial donor masses
in the range 4.0 to 7.0 M⊙. Simulations are initiated from prebuilt
zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) models with initial composi-
