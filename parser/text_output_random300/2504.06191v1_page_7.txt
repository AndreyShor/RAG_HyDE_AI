Fig. 2 The r and s process production for a kilonova event, in (a) Fe, Co, Ni and Zn isotopes are 
shown for the r-process and in (b) Fe, Co, Sr, and Ni isotopes are shown for the s-process. 
For the galactic case we use the galactic star formation rates given in Eq. (9) which are designed 
to reflect the physical and observational properties of each galaxy type. For the spiral galaxies 
we have a steady inflow of gas from the intergalactic medium or recycling from stellar feedback. 
The constant stellar formation rate represents a reasonable and sustainable mass supply over 
billions of years.  For elliptical galaxies there is an early intense starburst period consuming and 
then expelling gas followed by a period of quiescence leading to a consistent fit with exponential 
decay.  For dwarf galaxies there is a more stochastic star formation rate that can occur on 
different time scales, so each term in the series represents a different active era as seen in such 
low mass galaxies. In Fig. (3) the heavy element abundances are shown as a function of galactic 
type and with and without massive neutrinos.  
          
 
Fig. 3. In (a) we show the galactic yields for isotopes of U, Eu and Th for each galactic type, 
elliptical, spiral and dwarf and in (b) we show the galactic normalized abundances with and 
without massive neutrinos which induce oscillations.   
In Fig. 4 we first show the abundances in two kilonovae, one with a 1.2 Mʘ ejecta and one with a 
1.5 Mʘ ejecta with and without neutrinos.  In both cases the massive neutrinos reduce the r-
process yields thereby reducing the heavy element abundance while the higher ejecta mass value 
contributes more to the enrichment process.
