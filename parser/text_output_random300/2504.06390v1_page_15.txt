Figure 3: Third-order nonlinear optical absorption coefficient as a function of photon energy

the material’s nonlinear susceptibility. As photon energy increases, the absorption coefficient
decreases from zero, reaches a minimum, and returns toward zero, revealing a resonant-like
nonlinear response around the polaron transition energy.
In Figure 3(a), without the electric field, this nonlinear signature becomes progressively
more pronounced with increasing magnetic field. The larger the field, the stronger the con-
finement and, thus, the stronger the polaronic response. This trend increases the population
difference between Landau levels and enhances the system’s third-order susceptibility. As
observed in linear absorption (Fig. 2), SiO2 and SiC substrates produce the deepest and
broadest nonlinear absorption minima, indicating stronger light-matter interaction due to
their balanced η and ℏωSO values. In contrast, HfO2 displays the weakest response because
of its low phonon energy despite a high η.
When the electric field is introduced (Figure 3(b)), the nonlinear absorption coefficient
becomes more negative for all substrates.
This behavior confirms that the electric field
