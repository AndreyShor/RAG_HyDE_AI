Figure 10. Contributions of self-similar hierarchies and the superstructure hierarchy to the (a, b) mean
velocity profile and (c, d) Reynolds stress profile. Panels (a) and (c) show individual contributions from the
three self-similar hierarchies, along with their cumulative effect representing the self-similar component.
Panels (b) and (d) include the additional contribution from the superstructure hierarchy and the total
combined profile. The shaded grey region indicates the log-law region.
flow. An analogous decomposition is evident for the Reynolds stress profiles, as depicted in
figure 10(c). Here, the three self-similar hierarchies primarily recover the logarithmic region,
while the inclusion of the superstructure hierarchy is essential for accurately reproducing the
full Reynolds stress profile, especially in the outer region, as shown in figure 10(d).
