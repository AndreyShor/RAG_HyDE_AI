for some partition {T1, T2} of T such that T1 contains qubits 2 and 3 and T2 contains qubit
4.
We then have that |ϕx0⟩separates at {T ∪T1, T2}.
By Lemma 4.6, either G(2)
0
disappears
on |ϕ⟩T ⊗|ϕx0⟩T1 ⊗|σ⟩T2 for any |σ⟩T2 ∈HT2 or G(2)
0
disappears on |σ⟩T∪T1 ⊗|ϕx0⟩T2 for any
|σ⟩T∪T1 ∈HT∪T1. In the former case, the ﬁnal target value does not depend on input qubit 4; in
the latter, it does not depend on input qubits 2 or 3. In either case, C cannot compute ⊕n.
Remark 6.10. The condition that all the ancilla qubits are initially |0⟩in Theorem 6.1 can be
relaxed to allow for a more general initial ancilla state, provided the overall initial state of the
circuit separates at {T, T1 ∪T2} and at {T ∪T1, T2}. That is, C cannot |α⟩-compute ⊕n for any
|α⟩such that
0n+1
⊗|α⟩separates at {T, T1 ∪T2} and at {T ∪T1, T2}.
Remark 6.11. Theorem 6.1 also holds for depth-2 circuits that include Gη-gates as in Eq. (14),
and the value of η need not be the same for each gate.

Further Research
Our techniques currently work for depth 2, but obviously, we would like to prove limitations on
QAC-circuits of higher depth. We hope the entanglement lemma (Lemma 4.3) will be useful for
depth 3 and beyond, however.
Lemma 5.3 is stronger than needed for the current results; by
committing clusters of input qubits to certain states, we can turn oﬀCZ-gates through more than
two layers. These two lemmas as well as Lemma 4.6 provide powerful tools for dealing with QAC-
circuits of higher depth. By simplifying a circuit in the right way, one hopes to reduce its eﬀective
depth, and this in turn may lead to an inductive proof of the limitations of such circuits.
More speciﬁcally, Lemma 4.3 may be useful for depth 3 and beyond because it disallows many
diﬀerent circuit topologies for QAC-circuits computing parity. For example, the following circuit
topology is impossible for simulating parity (or any classical reversible function for that matter)
cleanly unless the middle gate simpliﬁes:
1
2
3
4
5
6
(Here only the CZ-gates are shown; the single qubit gates are suppressed.) The reason is that, for
any classical input, the state on the far left is completely separable, and so the state immediately
after the ﬁrst layer is {2, 3, 4}-separable (separating at {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}). If the middle gate does
not simplify, then by the lemma, the state |ψ⟩immediately to its right must be {2, 3, 4}-entangled.
Now assuming a clean simulation, the state on the far right is completely separable, and so running
the circuit backwards from the right, we see that |ψ⟩must be {2, 3, 4}-separable (separating at
{{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5, 6}}). This is a contradiction.
Finally, we note that the techniques used to prove that parity cannot be computed by classical
AC0-circuits (i.e., random restrictions and switching lemmas) are not necessarily needed or even
relevant here, because fanout is taken for granted in the classical case, unlike in the quantum case.
