Figure 6. Comparison of (a,c,e) mean velocity profiles and (b,d,f) Reynolds stress profiles between synthetic
wall-attached turbulence (SWAT) and DNS data for Reynolds numbers (a,b) Re𝜏= 2000, (c,d) 5200, and
(e,f) 10000. Symbols represent DNS data from Lee & Moser (2015) (Re𝜏= 2000, 5200 ) and Oberlack
et al. (2022) (Re𝜏= 10000 ), and solid lines in matching colours indicate SWAT results. The shaded grey
region highlights the log-law region 3Re1/2

streamwise alignment and spanwise meandering within vortex packets. To maintain statistical
realism, the spatial distribution of these vortex packets is randomized independently for the
top and bottom walls. As described in § 2.3, the damping function (2.12) is applied separately
to each half of the channel, enforcing the no-slip boundary condition and ensuring that the
synthetic velocity field is suitable as initial conditions for DNS.
The DNS is performed by solving the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using
a Fourier-Chebyshev pseudo-spectral method (Kim et al. 1987). The computational domain
dimensions are 𝐿𝑥= 2𝜋in the streamwise direction, 𝐿𝑦= 2𝛿in the wall-normal direction
(with 𝛿= 1), and 𝐿𝑧= 𝜋in the spanwise direction. Note that though larger domain is usually
used for practical channel flow simulations, the present dimensions are sufficiently large to
capture accurate one-point flow statistics (Lozano-Dur´an & Jim´enez 2014), which is the
purpose of the current tests. The simulations are conducted at a friction Reynolds number
