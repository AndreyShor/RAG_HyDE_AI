Si, εCM, is represented in the following form:8
ρCM(T∆, ω) ≡εCM(T∆, ω) −1

Here, ωCM
k
(T∆) are the resonance frequencies, γCM
k
(T∆) are the level widths,
γ′CM
k
(T∆) are the radiation damping constants, and aCM
k
(T∆) are the amplitudes.
All these ﬁtting parameters depend on the temperature T via the dimensionless
quantity T∆= (T −T0)/T0, where T0 = 293 K. Thus, T∆varies from 0 to 2.833.
This corresponds to the range of T from 293 K to 1123K.
According to Ref. 8, the dielectric permittivity εCM(T∆, ω) satisﬁes the Kramers-
Kronig relations and its real and imaginary parts are the even and odd functions of
frequency, as it should be for any function which claims to play the role of dielectric
permittivity. However, it does not satisfy the condition
Imε(T∆, ω) > 0,
(7)
which must be valid for all bodies in the state of thermal equilibrium with the
environment in the absence of alternating electromagnetic ﬁeld in accordance with
the law of entropy increase (the second law of thermodynamics).6 Really, from (6)
one easily obtains
ImεCM(T∆, ω) =
3ImρCM(T∆, ω)
[1 −ReρCM(T∆, ω)]2 + [ImρCM(T∆, ω)]2 ,

From (8) it is seen that the sign of ImεCM coincides with the sign of ImρCM.
Next, from (9) one concludes that ImρCM and, thus, ImεCM are negative if the
following condition is satisﬁed for both k = 1 and k = 2:

By using the values of the ﬁtting parameters presented in Tables I and II
of Ref. 1, one ﬁnds that the inequality (10) is satisﬁed for both k = 1 and
k = 2 at T∆= 0.614, 0.785, 0.956, 1.126. 1.397, and 1.468. At the correspond-
ing temperatures T = 472.9 K, 523.0 K, 573.1 K, 622.9 K, 702.3 K and 723.1 K
the imaginary part of εCM(T∆, ω) takes the negative values over the frequency

1.62×1015 rad/s, respectively. All these frequency ranges belong to the range from 0
to 0.16 a.u. = 6.6 × 1015 rad/s where an excellent accuracy of the dielectric function
