resource cost is negligible compared to the time-evolution and we omit precise compilation and numerical
resource estimation here.

1 round of amplification.36

is an index label for all piecewise constant levels that form the
“ladder,” and ΛIR = minp,p̸=0 |kp| is the lower cutoff. The same cuts as before are shown on the right hand
side of Fig. 8. The success probability for the NH3BF3 instance discussed earlier is approximately 0.29, also
indicating only 1 round of amplification (and that the power law in the interior region dominates the success
probability relative to the tail, hence giving a similar number to the Type II case).

Approximate rescaling factor bounds
We find easily-computable approximate upper bounds on the rescaling factors for each of the pairwise
interaction block-encoding terms to obtain a rough estimate of query complexity in the time-evolution.
Recall that k = Bp where B is an affine transformation built from the reciprocal lattice vectors and that
Ωdet B = (2π)3 where Ωis the real-space simulation cell volume. In general, as we will see below, the
rescaling factor bounds on the local and non-local terms are independent of the simulation cell and basis size
while the rescaling factor bounds on the Coulomb term (and exact rescaling factor for the kinetic term) only
depend on the maximum norm of the momentum exchange (momentum for the kinetic term). This makes
the bounds easy to compute as rough estimates for the total rescaling factor without having to generate a
large basis and numerically sum many terms as is required in the exact formulas.
Coulomb Term
We approximately bound the below sum with an integral, and further circumscribe the integration region
⋄0 := {k : k ∈BG0} with a sphere of radius Q = maxq∈⋄0 |q|.
36In the limit of large basis sizes, footnote 2 in Ref. [75] with d = 3 and x = 3 gives an analytical integral estimate using
box integrals for the success probability as 0.274, close to the numerical value found. We note that this analytical value further
differs from the 0.239 value computed in the earlier Ref. [28] which is lower by factor of
1
(1−1
23 ) due to an imperfect (but
efficient) preparation of the reference state in their circuit construction.
