Since ηY
l is localized to the right of ηX
k , it commutes with the adjoint of ⟨ηX
k |f(ξX
i )⟩and therefore
⟨ηY
l | ⟨ηX
k |f(ξX
i )⟩˜g(ηY
s )⟩= ⟨ηX
k |f(ξX
i )⟩⟨ηY
l |˜g(ηY
s )⟩.
After summing over k we have that
β ◦Ω(f ⊗g)(ηX
t ⊗ηY
s ) =

ηY
l ⊗f(ξX
i ) ⟨ηY
l |g(ξY

j |ηY
s ⟩⟨ξX

Finally, since ˜g(ηY
s ) is positively localized, then
β ◦Ω(f ⊗g)(ηX
t ⊗ηY
s ) =
X

X

l ⟨ηY

which proves the assertion.

5. Comparison with the Drinfeld center
5.1. Fully faithful embedding into the center. Our next goal is to show that the category
of DHR bimodules over a net satisfying Conditions 5.6 and charge-transporter generation 4.10
can be realized as the Drinfeld center of an appropriate C∗-tensor category. The ansatz again
comes from the correspondence between the regular half braiding Zreg and the basic construction
B1. Recall that when C is a fusion category, Zreg is an algebra in Z(C) such that the category
of Zreg-modules in Z(C) is equivalent to C. The forgetful functor Z(C) →C corresponds to the
free module functor Z 7→Zreg ⊗Z.
Lemma 5.1. Given X, Y ∈DHR(A•), the restriction
cY−: X−⊠A−Y−→Y−⊠A−X−
of the DHR braiding β is natural in Y for A−-bimodule maps and natural in X for A-bimodule
homomorphisms.
Proof. Let T : Y−→Y ′
−be a homomorphism of A−-bimodules. Let F1 < F2 be regions in
(−∞, −1], and pick bases (ξi)i ⊂X, (ηj)j ⊂Y localized in F1 and F2, respectively. Then,
by Proposition 4.6, when (η′
k)k ⊂Y ′ is a basis localized in F2, the coeﬃcients ⟨η′
k|T(ηj)⟩
belong to A[−b,−1] for some b. By arranging F1 to be disjoint from [−b, −1], we can follow the
same argument as the naturality of braiding for A-bimodule homomorphisms [Jon24, Theorem
3.13].
□
Remark 5.2. If we try to apply A−-bimodule homomorphisms to X, the above argument breaks
down in the following way: T(ξi) would be supported in [−a, −1] that contains F2, and the
argument of [Jon24, Theorem 3.13] does not carry over.
To simplify the notation, we will write C for C−from now on.
Proposition 5.3. The functor F−induces a braided monoidal functor
˜F : DHR(A•) →Z(C),
X 7→(X−, c).
Proof. For X ∈DHR(A•), we assign as a half braiding the restriction cY−: X−⊠A−Y−→
Y−⊠A−X−of the braiding on DHR(A•). By Lemma 5.1 this is a well-deﬁned assignment. The
monoidal structure of F−induces a monoidal structure on ˜F. Finally, to see that ˜F is braided
notice that the braiding in Z(C) is deﬁned via the half braiding (3.1). But, by construction,
the half braiding of an object X−in Z(C) comes from the braiding in DHR(A•).
□
Proposition 5.4. Suppose that A• satisﬁes charge-transporter generation 4.10. Then the func-
tor ˜F is fully faithful.
