1998), that are indispensable to modeling complex systems with the interplay of non-trivial
geometries, and multiple physical phenomena.
Despite the potential impact, the application of LLMs to engineering simulation tasks like
FEA remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we begin to bridge this gap by measuring
the ability of LLMs and LLM-agents to build models and solve engineering problems using
finite element analysis.
Our contributions are the following:
• We introduce a benchmark intended for LLM and agentic research on engineering
simulation, a novel domain for LLM benchmarks. The benchmark consists of (1)
FEABench Gold: 15 manually verified problems, in addition to (2) FEABench Large:
a larger set of 200 algorithmically parsed tasks. The problems in FEABench Gold are
(a) quantitatively verifiable, that is, if solved completely and correctly, a desired target
value will be computed and exported to a table, (b) manually confirmed to have input
problem descriptions that are self sufficient and do not omit information necessary to
solve the problem (c) manually verified to be solvable, i.e. we confirmed that if the steps
to model the problem are followed faithfully in COMSOL Multiphysics® the desired
target value is computed. The target values are expected to be largely independent of
the modeling software. The LLM’s objective is to read the problem specification and
operate COMSOL Multiphysics®by generating a sequence of Java calls to its API that
would build the model and compute the target. The skills this requires include (1) code
generation in a low-resource setting, (2) inferring spatial dimensions and representing
objects as compositions of geometrical primitives, (3) making correct and consistent
physics reasoning decisions (e.g.: boundary conditions and properties).
• We further define two versions of the tasks in FEABench Gold– ModelSpecs and Plan ,
to probe different versions of task complexity.
• We introduce a holistic automated evaluation strategy with intermediate metrics that
seek to measure different facets of ‘distance to a correct solution’. We benchmark
different SOTA LLMs on their baseline (single-turn) performance with these metrics.
• Finally, we design an interface in which an LLM can interact with the COMSOL
Multiphysics® API and with specialized auxiliary functions and and build an agent
that uses execution feedback to improve its solution over multiple turns.
We selected COMSOL Multiphysics®as the framework for our benchmark because it is
extensively used for commercial engineering analysis as well as scientific research and
supports a wide range of physics models. The FEA workflow is relatively canonical, the
reasoning approach for modeling is similar to other FEA software, and problems typically
involve a shared conceptual breakdown into a sequence of steps that involve defining 1)
Geometry, 2) Material properties, 3) Physics, 4) Mesh 5) Numerical Analysis and Solver
settings, and 6) Postprocessing (details in Appendix D.2).
