FIG. 7.
Reconstructed evolution of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w(z) from SNe, BAO, and combined
(SNe+BAO) data. A BBN prior and a CMB measurement of θ∗are included when BAO measurements are used. The top
row (A1, A2, A3) uses BAO data from DESI DR1, while the bottom row (B1, B2, B3) uses BAO data from DESI DR2. From left
to right, the columns show SNe data from PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5, respectively. The blue and red shaded regions
denote the 68% confidence intervals from SNe-only and BAO-only fits, respectively, and the black hatched regions show the
combined SNe+BAO constraints. The black solid line in each panel indicates the best-fit reconstruction for the combined data.
The horizontal dotted line at w = −1 corresponds to the value for a cosmological constant.
