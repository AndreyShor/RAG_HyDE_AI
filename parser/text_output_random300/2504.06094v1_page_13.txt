⟨ηi|ξ⟩̸= 0 should happen for some i. Thus, for each Y we have some Y ′ ∈Irr(C+) such that
A(Y ⊠Y ′) is nonzero. This shows that, if Irr(C−) is an inﬁnite set, then supp(A) is also inﬁnite.
It remains to show that Irr(C−) is inﬁnite if and only if Irr(C+) is inﬁnite. By symmetry it is
enough to show that the ﬁniteness of Irr(C−) implies the same for Irr(C+). If Irr(C−) is ﬁnite,
then Proposition 5.4 implies that DHR(A•) is a full subcategory of Z(C−), hence is a fusion
category. Then, Irr(C+) has to be ﬁnite as well.

4.4. Equivalence between C+ and C−under algebraic Haag duality. Let us further
assume that A• satisﬁes the algebraic Haag duality. We will just use the property A−= A∩A′
+.
Proposition 4.20. Given X ∈DHR(A•), the A−-bimodule X−can be described as
X ∩A′
+ = { ξ ∈X | ∀a ∈A+, aξ = ξa } ,
that is, the subspace of A+-central vectors in X.
Proof. The inclusion of X−in X ∩A′
+ is obvious by construction, so let us show the reverse
inclusion. Let us ﬁx a basis (ξi) localized in F ⊂(−∞, −1], and η be a vector in X ∩A′
+. Then
the inner product ⟨ξi|η⟩commutes with A+, and by the algebraic Haag duality, belongs to A−.
This shows that η is in the span of ξiA−, which shows the claim.

Proposition 4.21. Let A• be an abstract spin system satisfying algebraic Haag duality. Given
X, Y ∈DHR(A•), the assignment
(4.2)
HomC(X−, Y−) →HomB0-A(X, Y ),
f 7→˜f
is a natural isomorphism.
Proof. First notice that the deﬁnition of ˜f is independent of the choice of projective basis of X−.
This follows from Proposition 2.7 relating the charge transporters that connect two diﬀerent
choices of such bases. That ˜f is a right A-module map is an immediate consequence of the
A-linearity of the inner-product of X. Now, for b ∈A+ we have that

˜f(bx) =

j
bf(ξj) ⟨ξj|x⟩= b ˜f(x),
where the second equality uses that (ξi) is negatively localized, and the last equality holds due
to Proposition 4.20 since f(ξj) ∈Y−. For b ∈A−
(4.4)
˜f(bx) =
X

f(ξj) ⟨b∗ξj|x⟩=

⟨ξi|x⟩=

f (bξi) ⟨ξi|x⟩

X
i
bf(ξi) ⟨ξi|x⟩= b ˜f(x),
where the second equality expresses b∗ξj in terms of the projective basis, and the ﬁfth and sixth
equalities uses the fact that f is an A−-bimodule map. It follows that ˜f is a B0-module map,
and thus the assignment (4.2) is well-deﬁned.
