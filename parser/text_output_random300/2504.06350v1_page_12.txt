Figure 6: Explicit implementation of the isometry of Eq. (16) (details in Ref. [134])
A simple case of self-testing is given by the maximal violation of CHSH of Eq. (11). It is easy to
observe that any realization such that β = 2
√
2 consists of anticommuting operators on the support of
the state |ψ⟩, {MA|0, MA|1} |ψ⟩= {NB|0, NB|1} |ψ⟩. Indeed, let MA|± =
MA|0±MA|1
√
2
, the sum-of-square
(SOS) decomposition of the shifted CHSH operator assures that:
2
√
21 −ˆβ = (MA|+ −NB|0)2 + (MA|−−NB|1)2
√
2
⪰0.
(19)
Then the anticommutation comes from β = 2
√
2 =⇒MA|+ = NB|0 |ψ⟩and MA|−|ψ⟩= NB|1 |ψ⟩. The
explicit isometry of Eq. (16) is given in the circuit 6. Anologously for the isometries on the measurements
of Eq. (17). Similar calculations holds when only one detector is inefficient [135] (see sec. 2.4.1 putting
αB = 0 in (27)) and the tilted Bell operator can be obtained, i.e. ˆβ + αAMA|0(see Eq. (27)) such that

(20)
in terms of polynomials Pi ∈{1, MA|x, NB|y, MA|x ⊗NB|y}. SOS decomposition allows to prove that
if maximal violation βQ =
p
2 + α2
A is obtained then the optimal realization (|ψ⟩AB , MA|±, NB|y) is
self-tested [136, 134], with
|ψ⟩AB = cos θ |00⟩+ sin θ |11⟩,
NB|0 = σz,
NB|1 = σx,
MA|± = cos µ σz ± sin µ σx
(21)
where αA = 2/
√
1 + 2 tan2 2θ, tan(µ) = sin(2θ).
If the polynomials Pi are written in terms of the
operators of any optimal realization, then ∀i Pi |ψ⟩= 0.
These conditions implies the existence of
operators {ZA, XA, ZB, XB} satisfying
ZB |ψ⟩AB = ZB |ψ⟩AB ,
sin θXA(1 + ZB) |ψ⟩AB = cos θXA(1 −ZA) |ψ⟩AB .
(22)
In turn, Eq. (22) ensures the existence of local isometries ΦA and ΦB such that
ΦA ⊗ΦB |ψ⟩AB = |ψ⟩˜

Self-testing can be made robust in the sense that in a neighborhood of the maximal quantum value IβQ,
there exists a physical realization R that is close—up to a local isometry—to the ideal realization RQ (see
numerical SWAP technique in [137, 138]). The most general case involving two inefficient detectors, the
SOS decomposition is analyzed with NPA hierarchy (see Sec. 2.2) without finding a simple expression
for the polynomial Pi, unless the inefficiency of the detectors is the same [139]. The solution in this case
is obtained with Jordan’s lemma [110] and Groebner basis.
Lemma 1. (Jordan’s lemma) In CHSH, {Ma|x}a,x=0,1 and {Nb|y}b,y=0,1 can be projective w.l.o.g., then
there must exist a local unitary transformations that simultaneously block-diagonalize the observables
MA|x, NB|y, with blocks of size 1 or 2. But, to compute ⟨MA|x⟩ψ, ⟨NB|y⟩ψ we can always complete a one-
dimensional block by adding to it a projector over a state in the null space of the corresponding reduced
state ρA(B) = TrB(A)|ψ⟩⟨ψ|. We can thus assume all blocks to be two-dimensional and write Alice’s
measurement operators as
MA|0 =

A|0 =

MA|1 =

M (i)
A|1 =

(cos θA

(24)
where index i iterates over the Jordan blocks. Similarly, for Bob’s observables.
