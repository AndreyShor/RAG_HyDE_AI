Abstract
We utilize the machine learning to extrapolate to the inﬁnite model space
the no-core shell model (NCSM) results for the energies and rms radii of the
6He ground state and 6Li lowest states. The extrapolated energies and rms
radii converge as the NCSM results from larger model spaces are included in
the training dataset for ensemble of artiﬁcial neural networks thus enabling
an accurate predictions for these observables.
Keywords:
No-core shell model, ab initio approaches, machine learning,
artiﬁcial neural networks, extrapolation of variational calculations
1. Introduction
Machine learning methods are increasingly utilized in both theoretical
and experimental studies of atomic nuclei [1]. In this paper, we continue
exploring the machine learning techniques for extrapolating results of varia-
tional calculations of nuclear observables to inﬁnite model spaces.
The no-core shell model (NCSM) [2] is currently one of the most promis-
ing ab initio approaches to theoretical investigations of nuclei. In the NCSM,
all nucleons are spectroscopically active, and their motion is governed exclu-
sively by the chosen model of realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) and, if needed,
three-nucleon (3N) interactions, without any phenomenological assumption.
