women was 40% and almost 100% less than for men for phenogroups 1 and 2, respectively, while 
IDisp for the SDOH demographic correlate of race was approximately 19 and 47% less for the non-
White groups than for White patients. The Theil Index T suggested that the radiomic phenotype 
show group similarity within the SDOH demographic correlate of race (0.092 and 0.097 for 
phenogroup 1 and 2, respectively). However, T was an order of magnitude different between the 
phenogroups for the demographic correlate of sex (0.014 in phenogroup 1 and 0.0012 in 
phenogroup 2), suggesting that there were more inter-group differences in radiomic phenotype in 
phenogroup 2. As expected, the MLD results showed the same trend as the results for T, as both 
measures are population-weighted and utilize natural logarithm of health rates.

Discussion 
We believe this is the first reported analysis of using medical image-based features as inputs 
to an HD index. This positions medical images to serve as a novel probe that can be utilized in HD 
research and importantly, can lead to re-use of medical images that would otherwise sit in storage 
without further benefit to society. Notably, while most data used for HD research comes from 
medical records such as routine laboratory tests and clinical information, automatic extraction and 
aggregation of EHR data can be difficult and time consuming due to differing data format 
standards. On the other hand, medical images are acquired in a readily-accessible (DICOM) 
format,52â€“54 making routine computerized analyses straightforward once a pipeline is set up. While 
this study focused on surrogate features from the output of a DL model on chest radiographs, the 
methods can easily be applied to human-engineered radiomic features and medical images from 
any imaging modality.  
Dashboards for measuring HDs are important tools that aggregate data and analysis into 
platforms that support population-level research and inform the development of mitigation
