Figure 4.11: Square root of the diagonal entries of the IHOU covariance matrix for the DIS datasets
normalized to the experimental central value Di. We show the IHOU before and after adding to the
covariance matrix Eq. (4.8) that accounts for uncertainty on anomalous dimensions the extra component
Eq. (4.27) due to the massive coefficient function. The experimental uncertainty is also shown for
comparison.
4.2.1. N3LO corrections to DIS structure functions
In Section 1.3.3 we have summarized how the DIS structure functions Fi are evaluated from the
convolution of PDFs and coefficient functions. As mentioned, the N3LO massless DIS coefficient
are known, while the massive corrections are not completely available, see also Sections 1.3.3
and 1.4.1.
Here, with the same spirit of Section 4.1.6, we adopt an approximation for the N3LO contribution
C(3)
i,k (x, αs, m2
h/Q2) to massive coefficient functions for photon-induced DIS and neglect the
axial-vector coupling of the Z boson, while we treat heavy quarks in the massless approximation
for the W boson exchange. Such an approximation, based on known partial results, has been
presented in Ref. [78], and recently revisited in Ref. [88]. The approaches of these references
rely on the same known exact results, and differ in the details of the way they are combined
and interpolated. We will follow Ref. [88], see also Ref. [79], to which we refer for further
details. Exact results come from threshold resummation and high-energy resummation, and are
further combined with the asymptotic large-Q2 limit, thereby ensuring that the approximate
massive coefficient function reproduces the exact massless result in the Q2/m2
h →∞limit. In
the approach of Refs. [88, 79] the massive coefficient functions are written as
C(3)
i,k (x, m2
h/Q2) = C(3),thr
i,k
(x, m2
h/Q2)f1(x) + C(3),asy
i,k
(x, m2
h/Q2)f2(x) ,
(4.24)
where C(3),thr
i,k
and C(3),asy
i,k
correspond to the contributions coming from differently resumma-
tions, and f1(x) and f2(x) are two suitable matching functions.
