[6], this is the first direct transport evidence for these states in tMoTe2, demonstrating 
the high quality of our device. At TMC =15 mK, the plateau of νh = 1 IQAH state spans 
over a large filling range (νh ~ 0.9 to 1.25), making it difficult to determine C based on 
the Streda formula. Instead, we fit C of the νh = 1 IQAH state at higher temperature, 
which is in good agreement the expected value of C =1. However, for the RIQAH states, 
although ρxy shows a clear h/e2 plateau, the measured dispersion does not correspond 
to C = 1; instead, it is closer to C = 2/3 (Extended Data Fig. 5). The underlying 
competing nature requires further theoretical and experimental investigations. 
 
Figure 2k demonstrates the symmetrized ρxx and anti-symmetrized ρxy measured under 
B = ±0.1 T as a function of νh, at TMC = 15 mK and D = 0. The quantized Hall plateaus 
and corresponding local dips in ρxx for the νh = 1 IQAH state, νh = 2/3, 3/5, 4/7 FQAH 
states, and the RIQAH states are clearly observed. The quantization of the νh = 2/3 
FQAH state is within 1% accuracy of 3h/2e2 over a narrow range of νh = 2/3 ± 0.005, 
and the quantization of the RIQAH state is within 1% accuracy of h/e2 in the range of 
νh = 0.63 ± 0.01. The quantization is less accurate for the 3/5 and 4/7 FQAH states at 
TMC = 15 mK, with deviations of about 5% and 3%, respectively, from 5h/3e2 and 7h/4e2. 
Similar features can also be identified in σxx and σxy plots, as shown in Extended Data 
Fig. 6. 
 
These data solve an important puzzle regarding the dip in ρxy between νh = 2/3 and 3/5 
FQAH states observed in previous studies of 3.5°- 4° tMoTe2 [3,4]. The ρxy dip is 
actually due to the undeveloped RIQAH state. As shown in the temperature dependence 
data of ρxx and ρxy versus νh (Fig. 3a,3b), the RIQAH state has a smaller energy scale 
than the νh = 2/3 FQAH state, therefore requires lower temperatures (< 300 mK) and 
reduced disorder broadening for observation. At higher temperatures, the measured ρxy 
and ρxx around νh = 2/3 are essentially the same as previous reported results [3]. Note 
that in between of νh = 3/5 and 4/7, similar ρxy dip has also been observed at low 
temperatures, which may indicate the presence of another RIQAH state with an even 
smaller energy scale. 
 
In two-dimensional electron gas system under strong magnetic fields, the RIQH state 
is one type of quantum solid that competes with the fractional quantum Hall liquid. The 
RIQH effect occurs at fractional fillings of Landau levels, and can be understood as the 
formation of interaction-driven triangular Wigner crystal (WC) or electron bubble 
phases (where several electrons/holes become localized near each WC lattice site), 
superimposed on fully-filled Landau levels. In the lowest Landau level, previous 
studies of AlxGa1-xAs/Al0.32Ga0.68As heterostructures reported a RIQHE between 
Landau level filling factor νLL = 2/3 and 3/5, also centered at νLL ≈ 0.63. Our results
