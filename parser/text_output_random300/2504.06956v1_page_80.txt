Brownian bridge above a curve

Hence, plugging this estimate back into (A.21) and recalling (A.20), we get that

≤eδ+δ+c3

ζa,k(0)(u + ζa,k(0))√s .
Thanks to Proposition A.5, Lemma A.7, and by using the fact that ζa,k(s) ≤ζa,0(s) + ζa,k(0), we
have that there exist a constant c4 = c4(a) such that
P0,u,b(A+
0 ) ≤c4
ζa,k(0)(u + ζa,k(0))
b
,
and so, putting everything together, we obtain that there exist constants c5 = c5(a), c6 = c6(a) > 0
such that
P0,u,b(A+
0 \ A−
s ) ≤c5
ux2
b√s + c6

b
(δ + eδ)
If we choose x = c7(k + s)7/32, for some constant constant c7 = c7(a) > 0 for which x > ζa,k(s),
one can check that the first term on the right-hand side of the above expression dominates the others
as soon as s is larger than some constant depending on a, and so we have that
P0,u,b(A+
0 \ A−

for some constant c8 = c8(a).

Random walk estimates
We collect in this subsection some results that allows us to transfer the statements for Brownian bridge
we obtained in the previous subsection to the case of the random walk.
Lemma A.10. Let ζ : R+
0 →R+
0 be a non-decreasing concave function. For each x ∈R, all
b ≥k ≥1 it holds that
Px,u,b
 b\
j=k
{Bj > −ζ(j)}
 Bk = z

s∈[0,b−k](Bs + 2ζ(k + s)) > 0

.
Similarly, for all x ∈R and all b ≥k ≥1, it holds that
Px,u,b
 b\
j=k
{Bj > −ζ(j)}
 Bk = z

≥Pz,u,b−k

inf
s∈[0,b−k](Bs + ζ(k + s)) > 0

.
Proof. The proof follows exactly the same lines as that of [BL18, Lemma 4.15].
Lemma A.11. For a, k > 1, let ζa,k : R+
0 →R+
0 be the function defined in (A.17). There exist
constants c1 = c1(a), c2 = c2(a) > 0 such that for all ι ∈(0, 1/8), b ≥1 sufficiently large,
u ∈[bι, b3/4], and all k ∈(c2, b/2],
