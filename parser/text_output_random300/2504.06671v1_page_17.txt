While the aforementioned defects have demonstrated the greatest potential for quantum applications, 
new defect candidates are continuously emerging. Among these are the carbon antisite-vacancy pair 
(CAV) and chromium (Cr)-related defects in SiC. CAV defects are typically introduced via irradiation 
[75,76], while Cr-related centers can be incorporated either through Cr ion implantation [77]. Although 
the fabrication techniques and charge state control for these emerging defects are still underdeveloped, 
continued advancements in the field suggest that substantial improvements can be expected in the 
coming years. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The remarkable potential of silicon carbide (SiC) and its point defects for quantum applications has been 
convincingly demonstrated over the past decade. Notable advancements have been made in defect 
engineering, particularly in the precise and reproducible creation of color centers such as silicon vacancy 
and divacancy. Techniques such as focused ion beam (FIB) implantation and femtosecond laser writing 
have emerged as powerful tools. These methods offer enhanced control over the spatial localization and 
density of defects, which is essential for scalable quantum device fabrication. Additionally, a significant 
milestone in defect engineering has been the achievement of optical charge state control in divacancy 
centers, marking a critical step toward reliable quantum operation. The level of understanding and control 
achieved for defects such as silicon vacancy and divacancy has not yet been reached for other, newly 
emerging defects. However, these emerging defects may still find unique applications within the broader 
field of quantum technologies, even if not directly as qubits  
Among the different polytypes, 4H-SiC continues to lead the field due to the availability of high-purity 
material and well-established fabrication protocols. Nonetheless, the potential of other polytypes, such 
as 3C-SiC and 6H-SiC, remains largely untapped. These materials present unique properties and 
opportunities that warrant further investigation, as they may offer alternative pathways for the 
development of scalable quantum technologies.
