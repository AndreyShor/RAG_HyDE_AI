Working in terms of the dimensionless variables, Z = −E3B2, W = E2BD, where
µ = 1, it is easy to plot the curve in the (Z, W) plane corresponding to △(V ′

being the discriminant. (see below).

We now have enough information to graph Veff(r) in the distinct cases which can arise.
Bearing in mind that
˙r2 = 2(E −Veff(r)) = f(u),
