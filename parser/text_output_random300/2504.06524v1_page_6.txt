where N1D = 20 for the given parameters. Moreover, the
conductance spectrum for λ = 0.5t exhibits a prominent
zero-bias peak, as shown in Fig. 5(b). This perfect con-
ductance quantization suggests that the N1D-fold degen-
erate ZESs, initially localized at the junction interface,
penetrate into the dirty NM segment while retaining their
high degree of degeneracy.
Therefore, they form per-
fect transmission channels within the dirty NM-SC junc-
tion [49, 50].
This unusual superconducting proximity
eﬀect, accompanied by the penetration of topologically
protected ZESs, is analogous to the anomalous proxim-
ity eﬀect observed in 2D nodal px-wave SCs [46, 47]. As
a result, we propose a striking perfect charge transport
that clearly manifests the presence of highly degenerate
ZESs.
Summary. In summary, we investigate a novel topo-
logical superconducting phase emerging in a Q1D sys-
tem, where a unidirectional SOC potential of a PST co-
exists with a dxy-wave pair potential. Finite-size eﬀects
lead to hybridization of the ﬂat-band ABSs, resulting
in multiple band crossings.
Introducing the unidirec-
tional SOC opens a full energy gap in the ABS spectrum
and gives rise to an exceptionally large winding number,
N1D. Numerical calculations demonstrate the emergence
of topologically protected N1D-fold degenerate ZESs at
both ends of the Q1D system. Furthermore, a distinctive
perfect transport phenomenon serves as an unambiguous
signature of these ﬁnite-size-induced topological phases.
These ﬁndings oﬀer new avenues for studying topological
superconducting phases driven by gapped ABSs.
