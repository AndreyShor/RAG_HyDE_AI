To extract the critical exponent we first find a zero of ∆(κ, ϵ) = −κϵ−4
3δκ2+25κ3 and
then insert it in Eq.2 to find the corresponding slope as a function of ϵ. To make sure that
we work in a well defined mathematical limit we take ϵ to scale like δ2. This guarantees
the correct expansion in δ for the d −ϵ related theory. The two roots of ∆(κ, ϵ) = 0 are

. The corresponding critical exponents, ω+ and ω−are
plotted in the left panel of Fig.7 for δ = 0.1 and their explicit form as function of δ and ϵ
(assumed to be of order δ2) is given by:

Finally we solve SCR numerically for ω+ and ω−separately. We plot the result for
the reconstructed Y±-functions by the corresponding blue and orange color in the right
panel of Fig.7 together with the original input from Eq.8 shown by red-dashed lines. The
solution for ω+ matches the part smoothly connected to the Gaussian FP while the one
or ω−matches the part connected to the interacting IR fixed point and gluing them we
reproduce the original β-function. This means that one alone is insufficient to reconstruct
the full flow. The non Lipschitz behaviour of ω is explicit in Fig.7 occurring when ω±
vanish which is highlighted by the green circle.
Figure 7: (Left) We show the two critical exponents corresponding to the two FPs
of β, (δ = 0.1). In the ϵ →0 limit, the blue solution is connected to the Gaussian
FP while the orange one is connected to the Banks-Zaks FP. (Right) For both
ω±, we solved numerically the SCR. The reconstructed solutions is plotted in
terms of Y .

Large N
We now move to examples featuring a large number of degrees of freedom N in which the
expansion can be organized in powers of 1/N.
3.2.1
Gauge-fermion theory at the 1/Nf order
Consider the 4d SU(Nc) gauge theories at large number Nf of fermionic matter fields. The
1/Nf expansion for the four dimensional β-function and the Wilson-Fisher d −ϵ critical
exponent read [16]:
