magnetic dipoles.
Characterization: The final 3D ASI sample is analyzed us-
ing SEM for structural verification and magnetometry to as-
sess the magnetic properties, ensuring the islands behave as
individual magnetic “spins”.
Post-fabrication processing (optional): Depending on the
application, post-fabrication processing, such as annealing or
additional chemical treatments, may be performed to improve
the mechanical properties or to further refine the structure.
This can also include surface functionalization for specific ap-
plications in areas such as biosensors or photonic devices.
Advantages of Two-Photon Lithography:
High Resolution:
TPL achieves sub-micron resolution,
with the ability to fabricate features as small as 100 nm, sig-
nificantly below the resolution of traditional single-photon
lithography at comparable wavelengths.
Three-dimensional structuring: Unlike conventional pho-
tolithography, which is limited to two-dimensional patterns,
TPL can create complex 3D structures in a single step. In two-
photon polymerization (2PP), regions outside the laser focus
are less likely to reach the polymerization threshold of the
photoresist. This characteristic enables the creation of com-
plex 3D structures, as the proximity effect in two-photon ab-
sorption is much weaker compared to that in one-photon ab-
sorption.
Localized polymerization: The two-photon absorption pro-
cess ensures that polymerization occurs only at the focal point
of the laser, reducing the risk of unwanted material solidifica-
tion outside the desired region.
Focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID):
Another technique that has recently emerged as a promis-
ing way to create ASI is focused electron beam induced de-
position (FEBID), which is a vacuum-based nanofabrication
technique that writes 3D nanostructures using a high-energy
focused electron beam to dissociate molecules on a substrate,
regardless of their geometry, without the need for resist or
solvents62–65. This technique involves the use of a focused
electron beam to induce chemical reactions that locally de-
compose a precursor material, allowing for the controlled de-
position of material to form complex 3D structures [Fig. 3(d)].
Preparation of substrate and precursor material: The sub-
strate, often a silicon wafer or conductive material, is cleaned
and prepared to support the deposition process. The electron-
sensitive precursor, typically an organometallic compound is
introduced as a gas an adsorbs to the substrate. The precursor
will undergo decomposition under the influence of the elec-
tron beam, enabling the deposition of metallic magnetic is-
lands. For magnetic materials the precursor is typically di-
cobalt octacarbonyl, iron pentacarbonyl, or one of a variety of
nickel precursors.66,67 Deposition from condensed liquid pre-
cursors is also possible including nickel.68
Design of ASI lattice: The 3D ASI structure is designed
using specialized CAD software. The design includes a care-
fully arranged lattice of magnetic islands, which will behave
like individual spins in the ASI system. This design dictates
the spatial arrangement, size, and orientation of each magnetic
island.
FEBID process setup: The FEBID process takes place
within an SEM system equipped with a focused electron
beam. The electron beam is finely focused to direct energy
onto the precursor material, causing localized deposition at
specific locations.
Electron beam scanning and deposition: The electron beam
is scanned over the substrate according to the designed lattice.
The energy from the beam decomposes the precursor material,
selectively depositing metallic material at the targeted posi-
tions to form magnetic islands. The intensity, dwell time, and
scanning speed are precisely controlled to achieve accurate
deposition and structural integrity. This often requires precise
modeling and correction of the growth process to achieve true
3D structures.
Other possibilities for nano-structuring include 3D printing
and self-assembled templates to fabricate 3D nanostructures.
More details about these recent development of 3D ASI fabri-
cation can be found in Refs. [57, 63, and 69].

MICROSTATE CONTROL
In the previous sections, we discussed the theoretical back-
ground and common fabrication methods of artificial spin ice
systems, including comments on the vast microstate spaces
characteristic of ASI. The specific microstate defines the dy-
namic response of the ASI, hence the ability to prepare spe-
cific microstates is of great interest. In the following section,
we discuss approaches for controlling ASI microstates at a
global and local level.
The majority of ASI research focuses at least in part on
the system microstate – whether with fundamental physical
motivations such as statistical studies of vertex populations
and avalanche dynamics, or functional studies where the mi-
crostate defines system performance, such as in reconfigurable
magnonics or neuromorphic computing. As such, methodolo-
gies for ASI microstate control are of high importance.
Here, we will cover established microstate control ap-
proaches and comment on horizons for future development.
Microstate control and the vast reconfigurable microstate
space of ASI is at the very core of what makes magnetization
dynamics interesting in these strongly-coupled nanomagnetic
array systems, so we have described the fundamental concepts
and applied techniques in detail.
A.
Global vs Local Microstate Control Techniques
Broadly speaking, control of the ASI microstate can be
achieved either by global techniques which address all islands
simultaneously by applying some magnetic field or thermal
protocol across the whole system, or local techniques in which
the magnetization of individual islands is directly addressed.
Global techniques have the advantage of simplicity (the
most common global control technique is the application of
a magnetic field) but generally can only achieve control of
the ASI microstate at a statistical average level, where the net
