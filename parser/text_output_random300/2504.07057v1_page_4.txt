Fig. 1 A) example scene of MODIS 2.1µm reflectance image where ship-tracks can be seen. B)
detected ship-tracks are plotted in black lines with one example track marked with read ’X’. C)
mask of the detected ship-track and 30-pixel long segments that make up the track. The age of each
segment is plotted. The ship-track and control pixels on both sides are plotted in this figure.
The examples in Figure 1 illustrate how our method works. Figure 1A shows a
MODIS reflectance image. The detected ship-tracks in Figure 1A are shown as shapes
enclosed by black lines in Figure 1B. Figure 1B also shows virtual ship-tracks and
their ages coded in color. Detected tracks have good matches with some of the virtual
tracks. The age of each segment of a matched ship-track is the same as the age of
corresponding virtual tracks. The control and polluted cloud pixels for each segment
are shown in Figure 1C for one matched track, and they are used to calculate cloud
adjustments inside a segment. It is important to note that many virtual ship-tracks
lack corresponding detected tracks for a few possible causes. For example, only small
fraction of ships produce detectable ship-tracks [8, 16, 17, 26]; Detected ship-tracks
may have no corresponding virtual tracks due to errors in reanalysis wind, or their age
is longer than one day [20, 27], our time limit for simulated tracks; background cloud
conditions may not be favorable for ship-track detection due to overlapping clouds
and cloud type [8, 17].
