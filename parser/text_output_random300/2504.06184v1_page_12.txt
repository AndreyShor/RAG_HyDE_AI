Comparison with explicit results in general kinematics
In this section we take the limit of the amplitudes for Higgs + 3 partons through two
loops and we compare them with the asymptotic behaviour described in sec. 2, in order to
verify the conditions in eq. (2.41) and (2.42). The amplitudes for g g →g H and q g →q H
have been computed up to the terms of O(ǫ0) at one loop in ref. [127] and at two loops
in refs. [128, 129]. More recently, the one-loop amplitudes have been computed through
O(ǫ4) and the two-loop amplitudes up to O(ǫ2) [130]. Here we utilize the latter results,
which are given in the decay region for
H →g+(p1) + g+(p2) + g−(p3),
(3.1)
H →qL(p1) + ¯q(
Rp2) + g+(p3).
(3.2)
The analytic continuation to the physical region of the scattering processes
g−(p1) + g+(p3) →H + g+(p2),
(3.3)
qR(p1) + g−(p3) →H + qR(p2),
(3.4)
is described in refs. [130, 131]. After this step, the amplitudes are expressed in terms of
harmonic polylogarithms (HPLs) [132] in the variable v = m2
H
s13 ∈[0, 1] and two-dimensional
harmonic polylogarithms (2dHPLs) [133, 134] with indices in the alphabet {0, 1, −v, 1−v}
and argument u = −s23
s13 ∈[0, 1 −v].
3.1
Expansion of the amplitudes in the Regge limit
In order to derive the high-energy limit of the amplitudes, we perform the asymptotic
expansion of the HPLs and of the 2dHPLs. The former ones are expanded around v →0
using PolyLogTools [135]. Regarding the 2dHPLS, their argument u approaches u →0 for
gluon-gluon scattering, eq. (3.3), and u →1 for quark-gluon scattering, eq. (3.4). In each
amplitude, we select a set of 2dHPLs of transcendental weight w ≤6 that are independent
under shuﬄe relations. We denote either of them as
⃗f(v, x) =



ε6 G(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 −v, u)

where the parameter ε keeps track of the transcendental weight and x = −t/m2
H. The
2dHPLs obey linear diﬀerential equations‡

⃗f(v, x) = ε Mv(v, x) ⃗f(v, x),
(3.6)
∂
∂x
⃗f(v, x) = ε Mx(v, x) ⃗f(v, x),
(3.7)
‡The set of functions in ⃗f might be suitably extended to include 2dHPLs that do not appear in the
amplitudes, but do arise in the derivatives with respect to v and x.
