derived from the Fresnel equations. Now, we can write the electric field of the SHG signal,
out-coupled into medium 2, as:
E2,SHG(2ω) = i2ωL2(ω)L(2ω)
4cn2(2ω)
χ(2)
S (2ω, ω, ω)ˆe(ω)ˆe(ω)E2
1(ω),
(3)
where E1(ω) = E1(ω)ˆe(ω) is the incident pump field with the unit vector ˆe(ω) indicating
the pump polarization. In the following step we replace the electric fields with the peak
intensities via the relation Ik,peak(ω) = 1

We further assume that the 2D material is placed on a fused silica substrate with low
dispersion (i.e. n1(ω) = n ≈1.45) and the SHG is emitted in air (n2 = 1):
I2,SHG(2ω) =

In a final step we rewrite the equation in terms of the fundamental wavelength λFB instead
of the frequency ω and replace the nonlinear sheet susceptibility with the product of the
monolayer thickness dWSe2 ≈0.7 nm [3] and the bulk-like effective susceptibility χ(2):
I2,SHG(λFB) = 128π2n2d2

combining all constant quantities in the real-valued constant C3 ≈2.267×10−15 V2 m2 W−1.
In order to evaluate this equation with our measured average powers P(λFB) of the
FB pump and the generated SHG, we further convert them to peak intensities with the
expression:
Ipeak(λFB) = 2P(λFB)S
