5. Effect of fluid inertia
While considering the inertialess limit of St ≪1 facilitated analytical progress, there are
several circumstances in which inertia may become important, e.g. faster movements or larger
canals. Therefore, we consider the effect of fluid inertia by retaining the O(St) terms in the
governing equations (3.2a). Proceeding as in the previous section and seeking a solution in
powers of the small aspect ratio 𝜖, we seek a solution for the leading order axial velocity of
the form
𝑤0(𝑟, 𝑠, 𝑡) =

∑︁

𝑐𝑛(𝑡, 𝑠)𝜙𝑛(𝑟, 𝑠),
𝜙𝑛(𝑟, 𝑠) = 𝐽0

Here, 𝜙𝑛are the eigenfunctions for the Laplacian in a cylinder of local radius 𝑎(𝑠), subject to
Dirichlet boundary conditions (Batchelor 1973); the 𝜆𝑛are the zeros of the Bessel function
of the first kind 𝐽0(𝑧), thereby ensuring that the axial velocity satisfies the no-slip condition
at 𝑟= 𝑎(𝑠) in the rotating frame. Thus, substituting (5.1) into the momentum equation, and
using the orthogonality properties of Bessel functions we find

From the continuity equation, the flux 𝑄0 is independent of 𝑠. Therefore, we can evaluate
it at the location of the cupula, where the fluid velocity is known to be equal to the cupular

For an arbitrary inner radius 𝑎(𝑠), (5.4) can be solved using the Laplace transform, as shown
in Appendix C. Before tackling the general case, we focus on the simple case where the tube
radius is uniform, 𝑎(𝑠) ≡1.
5.1. A simple example
For the special case when 𝑎(𝑠) ≡1, i.e. the tube radius is constant, the pressure gradient can
be assumed to be independent of 𝑠, that is 𝜕𝑝0
𝜕𝑠= Δ𝑝0
