Propagator
Generalizing (13), the Feynman propagator is
GF(x −y, M) = ⟨0|T ϕ(x, M)ϕ(y, M)|0⟩.
(24)
Replacing the field with the representation in (17) and using (23) gives,
GF(x −y, M) =

d3⃗pr(⃗p, M)
2ωp
e−ip(x−y) ,
(25)
which has to be written in terms of 4-vectors. We achieve this in the usual way but with some
attention to the function r. We call for shortness s := x −y and consider the integral,

Writing p2 −m2 = (p −ωp)(p + ωp), integration on the known Feynman contour, and picking
up the pole at ωp −iϵ leads to,

Z
d3⃗pr(p0 = ωp, ⃗p, M)

e−ip(x−y) .
(27)
Comparing this with (25) implies,
r(⃗p, M) = r(p0 = ωp, ⃗p, M) ,
(28)
which is r(p, M) due to (18). Therefore, the propagator in momentum space, expressed through
4-vectors, is
GF(p, M) = i
r(p, M)
p2 −m2 + iϵ .
(29)
It is important to elaborate on the implications of (18) and (28). By comparing (8) and (29)
(regardless that the latter is in Minkowski space) , one sees that r is an even function in momen-
tum. This will turn out to be problematic for the consistency of the theory. The function r must
be odd, so we can modify it as
r(p, M, v) = V e−( p
M −v)2
(30)
where v is a constant 4-vector necessary to build r as a function not only of p2, and V = exp[v2]
is a normalization constant.
Among others, the introduction of a special direction, v, will imply the breaking of the
rotational invariance of the vacuum. Even more important for the rest of this work, the form of
