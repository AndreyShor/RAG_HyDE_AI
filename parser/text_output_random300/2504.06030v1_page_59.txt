7. Appendix - Some of the Wonders of the Weierstrass Elliptic Function
In trying to make the paper self-contained we have included this appendix.
We
concentrate our attention on the results we have found to be most useful both here and
in our work on the KLMN problem. Needless to say this is no substitute for original
references e.g. Ref. [14].
We first give some historical background which we have pieced together from Greenhill
(Ref. [14]). This illustrates the importance of fractional linear transformations in this
context. Some credit here should go to the mysterious Mr R. Russell (Ref. [24]). The
first result obviates the need to find the roots of the quartic f in some circumstances.
The final result only needs the initial position i.e. r0. Needless to say f is our original
quartic X, f(u) = 2

problems. (See Ref. [27]).
Lemma 7.1. (Euler-Lagrange)
Assume X(x) and Y (y) are both quartics of the same form, in binomial notation
(a, b, c, d, e)(x, 1)4 and (a, b, c, d, e)(y, 1)4, where
(a, b, c, d, e)(x, 1)4 = ax4 + 4bx3 + 6cx2 + 4dx + e.
Then the equation,
