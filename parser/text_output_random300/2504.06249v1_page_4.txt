To compare the DOS of generated structures with the ground truth conditioning data, we trained a separate
surrogate model that predicts atom-level DOS from input crystal structures. We first evaluate the conditional
generation by calculating the mean absolute errors (MAEs) between generated structures’ DOS and the
ground truth DOS. In particular, we let y denote the ground truth DOS used to condition the generation
process. We define ˆy as the predicted DOS from the ground truth structures, and ˆygen as the predicted DOS
from the generated structures. Table 1 presents the MAEs comparing: (1) y with ˆygen, and (2) ˆy with ˆygen.
We observe that both MAE (ˆygen, y) and MAE (ˆygen, ˆy) increase as the starting timestep T of the diffusion
process becomes greater. This aligns with the fact that as T increases, less information of the original crystal
structures is retained, making the diffusion process more reliant on generating high-quality structures from
pure noise. Consequently, the generated structures are more prone to deviate further from the ground truth,
leading to higher errors in the predicted DOS.
When comparing classifier-based and classifier-free guidance, we observe from Table 1 that classifier-free
guidance consistently achieves better performance. The difference in error between the two strategies is
relatively small at T = 200, which is expected, as the model retains enough information from the original
ground truth structures to enable both models to denoise more effectively to the ground truth structures,
and resulting in lower values of both MAE (ˆygen, y) and MAE (ˆygen, ˆy). However, at the starting timestep
T = 1000, where no information from the original structures is present, the performance of classifier-
based guidance deteriorates significantly. Specifically, when compared to that at T = 200, MAE (ˆygen, y)
at T = 1000 increases from 0.114 to 0.268, representing a 135% increase, while MAE (ˆygen, ˆy) rises
from 0.068 to 0.256, marking a 276% increase. In contrast, classifier-free guidance exhibits significantly
lower MAE increases from timestep T = 200 to T = 1000: a 17.6% rise in MAE (ˆygen, y) and a 79.6%
increase in MAE (ˆygen, ˆy). In particular, the forward surrogate model’s own error, MAE (ˆy, y), is 0.096.
This indicates that even at T = 1000, classifier-free guidance generates structures that align with the target
DOS reasonably well with an MAE of 0.120. Additionally, at T = 1000, 314 out of 10,158 structures
generated with classifier-based guidance fail to even map to a valid crystal graph for the forward surrogate
model, highlighting its inferior performance compared to classifier-free guidance.

Table 1: Mean absolute errors (MAEs) of density of states (DOS) comparing structures generated using
classifier-based and classifier-free guidance. ˆygen is the DOS predicted from generated structures, ˆy is the
DOS predicted from ground truth structures and y is the target DOS from test set. Comparisons are made
across three different denoising timesteps, T ∈{200, 500, 1000}, with T = 1000 representing generation
from fully random initializations. †: 314 out of 10,158 generated structures were excluded due to errors in
constructing the crystal graph. The forward surrogate model’s intrinsic error, MAE (ˆy, y), is 0.096.

Table 2:
Structure match rate and composition match rate for structures generated using classifier-
based and classifier-free guidance, compared to the test set.
The structure match rate is the percent-
age of structures satisfying the tolerances (stol=0.5, angletol=10, ltol=0.3) using pymatgen’s
StructureMatcher. The composition match rate is the percentage of structures whose compositions
perfectly match those of the test set. Comparisons are made across three different denoising timesteps,
T ∈{200, 500, 1000}, with T = 1000 representing generation from fully random initializations. †/‡:
9/372 out of 10,158 generated structures were excluded due to timeouts during metric calculation.
In Table 2, we evaluate the performance of the conditional generation using (1) structure match rate and
(2) composition match rate. The structure match rate quantifies the percentage of generated structures
that are geometrically similar to the ground truth structures, as determined by the StructureMatcher
algorithm from pymatgen within specified tolerances [22, 37]. The composition match rate represents
the percentage of generated structures that exactly match the ground truth structures in terms of chemical
composition. From Table 2, we observe that as T increases, both structure and composition match rates
decreases, highlighting that higher amount of noise during the generation process result in structures that
