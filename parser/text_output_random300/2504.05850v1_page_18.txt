Constructing the three-star (right) in D = 2λ + 2 dimensions by appending
an edge to the two-star (left). The weights are as indicated.
Note that in renormalizable QFTs, higher (non-logarithmic) divergences only appear in two-point
insertions which can be eliminated with the method of Section 5. Thereafter, a physical graph only has
logarithmic singularities.
8.4. Appending an edge with spin or with weight ̸= 1. Let D = 2λ + 2 = 4 + 2n −ϵ, n = 0, 1, . . ..
In this section we append an edge Qα
ν with spin α to the vertex z of a graph G, thus creating a new
graph G1 whose vertex z connects to the vertex z in G, see Figure 1. This is only possible (with the
method of this section) for certain weights ν. The range of all possible weights is ν = 1 −k/λ + |α|/2λ
for k = 0, 1, . . . , n + 1.
The case ν = 1, α = ∅appends a scalar edge of weight 1. The spin is only in the graphical function
f α
G(z). In this setup, appending an edge is equivalent to solving the differential equation (58). We have

An algorithm to determine (□α

G(z) is explained in the previous subsections. The result is unique
in the space of graphical functions.
Next, we consider the scalar case of weight ν = 1 −k/λ, k = 1, . . . , n + 1. We express the appended
edge as a string of k + 1 edges of weight 1, see [2]. Repeated use of (6) gives (see the proof of Proposition
39 in [2])

The string of k + 1 edges of weight 1 can be appended by repeatedly inverting □α
λ. It is not easily
possible to append more than n+2 edges because one runs into non-logarithmic infrared singularities for
k ≥n + 2.
If the appended propagator has spin α ̸= ∅, we append a scalar edge of weight ν −|α|/2λ (if possible)
and differentiate the appended edge with respect to z2 using (67). Note that this procedure can produce
extra singularities in intermediate steps so that even a convergent graphical function may need to be
dimensionally regularized.
8.5. A simple test and first benchmarks. To test the method of appending an edge we applied it to
the graph in Figure 3. The two-star is rational
(102)
fG(z) =
1
zz(z −1)(z −1).
The three-star is easily calculated with [23] by appending an edge to the scalar graph G. In four dimensions
it contains a Bloch-Wigner dilogarithm [17]. We want to obtain the graphical functions with spin k0 +k1
by taking k0 derivatives with respect to z0 and k1 derivatives with respect to z1 using Equations (67),
(68), and (70). Because each differentiation increases the pole order by one, the graphical function is
regular if k0, k1 ≤2λ −1.
We do this in two different ways. Firstly, we take derivatives of the three-star itself. Secondly, we take
derivatives of the two-star and append an edge to the vertex z. Both methods have to give the same
result. This is checked for all configurations and orders of ϵ. We stopped the calculations if it takes one
day on a single core of an office PC. The memory demand in these cases is modest (≈1GB). We did this
