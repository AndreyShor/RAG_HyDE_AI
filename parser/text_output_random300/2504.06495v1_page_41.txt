We stress again that in an actual measurement, the branching ratio δk does not shrink
with τ. But in a serious test of the Born rule (such as the example in the introduction
involving 1000 Stern–Gerlach measurements) the relevant δk values are expected to be small.
In that regime, the asymptotic conditions in Theorems 1 and 2 are expected to provide
accurate approximations, justiﬁed by Theorem 6.

Remarks and speculation on physical implications
In this section, we oﬀer some remarks and preliminary speculations on physical implications
of the Born rule emergence mechanism proposed in this paper.
Modiﬁcation of the Schr¨odinger equation
Our proposed small signal truncation mechanism suggests that standard quantum dynam-
ics are only violated when a quantum branch’s amplitude falls below a critical threshold.
However, as shown in the previous section, the typical squared amplitude ⟨ψ|ψ⟩will be well
above this threshold (exceeding it by a factor of τ for the median in (29) after applying the
exponential transformation) when conditioned on our branch surviving for a macroscopic
time τ after the experiment. Since our ability to observe and discuss the experiment requires
this survival condition, it seems highly improbable that we would ever detect any violation
of the Schr¨odinger equation in any actual quantum experiment.
Conservation laws
The Schr¨odinger equation guarantees conservation laws for physical observables through
Noether’s theorem, which connects symmetries to conserved quantities in the full quantum
state vector. However, due to quantum branching our observed reality follows a single path
through the branching tree, and conservation laws will generally be violated when consider-
ing only our single branch, which represents just a portion of the quantum state vector.11
11For example, when a particle prepared with spin-x up is measured in the y-direction, our branch ends
up with deﬁnite y-spin where none existed before, apparently creating angular momentum in that direction.
