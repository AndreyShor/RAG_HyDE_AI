above equations, as we have seen earlier. In this way, the update rule of the new cellular
automaton will altogether be described by permutations, extending the Cellular Automaton
Interpretation from the case of the Weyl equation (Section 2.1) to the Dirac equation.
However, as indicated above, we need to generalize the model of the Ising spin chain
in order to accommodate the arithmetic implied by the mass terms of the Dirac equation.
Instead of an Ising spin chain with periodic boundary conditions, we will implement a
“Necklace of Necklaces”. This we already alluded to in reference [24]. However, its torus-like
topology will now be made use of differently, once again based on two-state Ising spins.
Borrowing notation from quantum theory, the state of the automaton at time t = nT is
represented by
|Ψ⟩n := |s1, l1, . . . , s2k, l2k, . . . , s2k+1, l2k+1, . . . , s2S, l2S⟩,
(12)
where the spin variables can assume values s = ±1. We note that the variables here are
labeled by two indices, an either even or odd index for the “longitudinal” position, with
k = 1, . . . , S , and an index for the “transverse” position, −S, −S + 1, . . . , lk, . . . , S −1, S;
the index k on lk will mostly be suppressed when no confusion arises.
Furthermore, the following torus-like periodic boundary conditions are assumed:
s2S+1, l = s1, l, s2S+2, l = s2, l, for all l,
(13)
sk, S+1 = sk, −S, sk, −S−1 = sk, S, for all k.
(14)
Thus, the index k labels even- and odd-numbered sites along a “necklace” in the longitudinal
direction and each such site is part of a transverse “necklace”; altogether sites are labelled
by k, lk, often simplified to k, l, hence the name “Necklace of Necklaces”.
The states of the automaton, cf. Equation (12), are further restricted to have, for each
longitudinal position, say k′, exactly one spin up with sk′, l′ = +1 and all other spins down
with value sk′, l̸=l′ = −1.
The operator ˆL(k′) which measures the position of the one up spin at a given k′ is then
defined by
ˆL(k′) :=
S
∑
l=−S
l
2(ˆσz
k′, l + 12),
(15)
where ˆσz
k′, l denotes the usual diagonal Pauli matrix acting on the spin sk′, l. The restricted
automaton states are eigenstates of this operator, such that for sk′, l′ = +1, sk′, l̸=l′ = −1 we
obtain ˆL(k′)|Ψ⟩n = l′|Ψ⟩n .
We shall now employ the transverse position l′ of a single up spin with given longi-
tudinal position k′ to encode the integer value of the variables sL
n(k′) (k′ odd) or sR
n (k′) (k′
even) that are described by the Equations (10) and (11). Additions and subtractions due to
the mass terms then correspond to shifts of up spin positions.
A positive unit shift for a state with a single up spin at k′, l′ is effected by moving all
spins with this k′ one step towards increasing transverse position lk′. This is achieved by a
complete permutation – see Appendix A.1 – with a unitary operator ˆU⊥:
ˆU⊥(k′)| . . . , sk′, lk′ , . . . ⟩:= | . . . , sk′, lk′+1, . . . ⟩,
(16)
for all spins at fixed k′ with l ∈[−S, S], respecting the periodic boundary condition. This
operator is explicitly given in terms of pairwise transpositions of nearest neighbor spins:
ˆU⊥(k′) :=
S
∏
l=−S
ˆPl l+1(k′),
