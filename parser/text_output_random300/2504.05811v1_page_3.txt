including the latest data of polarization observables from the CLAS Collaboration [39]. However,
in comparison to γp →K+Σ0, the amount of experimental data available for γp →K0Σ+ remains
relatively sparse.
Many theoretical works have already been devoted to analyzing the data for KΣ photoproduc-
tion, based on the effective Lagrangian approaches, isobar models, Regge-plus-resonance models,
and so on [40–56]. In Refs. [43, 44] and Ref. [42], photoproduction data for KΣ have been simulta-
neously analyzed and effectively described using an isobar model and the J¨ulich-Bonn dynamical
coupled-channel approach, respectively. And the work in Refs. [40, 41] provides a comprehensive
analysis of the available data for γn →K+Σ−and γn →K0Σ0 reactions, based on an effective
Lagrangian approach in the tree-level Born approximation.
In this work, we employ the methodology used in Refs. [40, 41] to simultaneously analyze data
for γp →K+Σ0 and γp →K0Σ+ reactions. Our theoretical model incorporates contributions
from s-channel exchanges of N, ∆, N∗(including the hadronic molecules with hidden strangeness),
and ∆∗; t-channel exchanges of K, K∗(892), and K1(1270); u-channel exchange of Σ; and the
generalized contact term. We utilize this model to investigate the reaction mechanisms and test
the effects of hidden-strange molecules in γp →KΣ reactions.
The article is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly introduce the framework of our theo-
retical model. Sec. III presents the details of our fitting settings. In Sec. IV, we show the results
of our theoretical model along with some discussions. Finally, Sec. V provides the summary and
conclusions.

FORMALISM
As shown in Fig. 1, the gauge-invariant amplitude of KΣ photoproduction reactions in the
tree-level effective Lagrangian approach can be expressed as [40, 41]
M = Ms + Mt + Mu + Mint,
(1)
where the terms Ms, Mt, Mu and Mint stand for the amplitudes calculated from the s-channel
mechanism, t-channel mechanism, u-channel mechanism and the interaction current, respectively.
Fig. 1(a) presents the s-channel with exchanges of N, ∆, N∗, and ∆∗. The corresponding res-
onances are discussed in detail below. First, to investigate the effects of hidden-strange molecular
states in KΣ photoproduction, we introduce the seven molecules: N(1535)1/2−, N(1875)3/2−,
N(2080)1/2−& 3/2−and N(2270)1/2−, 3/2−& 5/2−.
