where we introduced the notation
[x]k ≡x(modk),
(2.11)
and we note that [k]k can be taken to be either 0 or k, depending on the whether the index
C′ is taken to range from 0 to k −1 or from 1 to k. That the ϕµ C′ obeying (2.10) are the
most general holonomies allowed by the transition functions was shown in [1] (the readers
can verify this themselves by considering the explicit form of Ωµ (2.4) and demanding that
the constant pieces commute with them). That, for each µ, there are gcd(k, r) independent
ϕµ C′ follows from the fact that there are gcd(k, r) different orbits of the integers C′ = 1, ...k,
obtained by identifying C′ with [C′ −r]k, as per (2.10).
In conclusion, as already stated, there are 4×gcd(k, r) independent SU(N) holonomies
ϕµC′. For gcd(k, r) = r, this is exactly the number of bosonic moduli required by the index
theorem for a charge-r/N self-dual SU(N) instanton.
Next, as described in the Introduction, we introduce a general fluctuation around the
constant-F background, already given in (1.4), which we reproduce here with the index µ

Note that Aµ has to obey the BCS (2.1), which in term determine the BCS on S and W.
Since they are important to our considerations, we list them explicitly, using the k × ℓindex
notation introduced in writing (2.7, 2.8):
1. For Sµ C′B′, with C′, B′=1, ..., k, combining Sk
µ and the first k (diagonal) entries of ωSω
µ
into a single U(k) matrix using the index notation, they are
Sµ C′B′(x + L1ˆe1) = Sµ [C′−r]k [B′−r]k(x) ,
Sµ C′B′(x + L2ˆe2) = ei2π C′−B′
k
Sµ C′B′(x) ,
Sµ C′B′(x + L3ˆe3) = Sµ C′B′(x) ,
Sµ C′B′(x + L4ˆe4) = Sµ C′B′(x) .
(2.13)
2. Similarly, Sµ CB, with C, B=1, ..., ℓ, combines Sℓ
µ and the last ℓ(diagonal) entries of
ωSω
µ into a single U(ℓ) matrix using the index notation, and obeys
Sµ CB(x + L1ˆe1) = Sµ CB(x) ,
Sµ CB(x + L2ˆe2) = Sµ CB(x) ,
Sµ CB(x + L3ˆe3) = Sµ [C+1]ℓ[B+1]ℓ(x) ,
Sµ CB(x + L4ˆe4) = ei2π C−B
ℓ
Sµ CB(x) .
(2.14)
12We recall, as discussed in the introduction, that the constant holonomies ϕµ C′ appearing in (2.7, 2.8) can
be absorbed into Sω,k,ℓ
