EDP convergence for nonlinear RDS

To conclude that the limits are indeed solution, we now assume the well-preparedness of
initial data
ιNρ0
N ⇀∗ρ0
and
lim
N→∞EN(ρ0
N) = E(ρ0) < ∞.
The energy identity combined with (2.4) and the limit chain rule inequality yield
0 = lim inf
N→∞LN(˜ρN, ˜N) ≥L(˜ρ, ˜) ≥0,
from which the energy-dissipation principle of the limit gradient system implies that ˜ρ is solution
starting at ˜ρ(0) = ρ0 and that ˜is given by the kinetic relation (2.3).

Gradient system for the reaction-diﬀusion system
We want to describe the evolution of i∗chemical species Xi with i ∈{1, . . . , i∗} =: I undergoing
diﬀusion in a subdomain Ω⊂Rd and interacting according to r∗chemical reactions:
X
i∈I
αr
i Xi ⇋
X
i∈I
βr
i Xi,
r ∈{1, . . . , r∗} =: R.
Throughout the paper we assume that the physical domain is given by Ω= Td (the d-
dimensional torus), and that we have ﬁnitely many species and reactions, i.e., i∗, r∗∈N. In the
following, we will also use the eﬀective stoichiometric vectors γr =: αr−βr ∈RI. Moreover, we
ﬁx reaction coeﬃcients κr > 0 (describing the reaction speed) for each reaction and diﬀusion
coeﬃcients δi > 0 for each species.

Discrete reaction-diﬀusion gradient systems
We present the gradient structure for the spatially discrete reaction-diﬀusion system with ﬁxed
N ∈N. Denoting Zd
N = (Z/NZ)d the set of discrete positions (with periodic boundary con-
ditions), and E :=

e = (e1, . . . , ed)⊤∈{0, 1}d, Pd
l=1 el = 1
	
the set of discrete directions, we
introduce the spaces
XN
:= (Xdom
N
, Xtar
N )
:= (I × Zd
N, R),
YN,diﬀ
:= (Y dom
N,diﬀ, Xtar
N,diﬀ)
:= (I × Zd
N × E, R),
YN,react
:= (Y dom
N,react, Xtar
N,react)
:= (R × Zd
N, R),
YN
:= (Y dom
N
, Y tar
N )
:= (Y dom
N,diﬀ× Y dom
N,react, Y tar
N,diﬀ× Y tar
N,react).
We introduce the short notation C(XN) := C(Xdom
N
; Xtar
N ) and analogously for all other spaces
of functions/measures over these spaces. Furthermore, given a time interval [0, T] we write
C([0, T] × XN) := C([0, T] × Xdom
N
; Xtar
N ) and analogously for all other spaces of functions or
measures over these spaces.
Abusing notation, we denote by ⟨·, ·⟩N the dual products for vectors as well as components,
e.g., for (ζ, ξ) ∈C(YN) and (u, v) ∈M(YN) we write
⟨(ξ, ζ), (u, v)⟩N = ⟨ξ, u⟩N + ⟨ζ, v⟩N =
