The article is organised as follows: in Section
• 2 we make an MB representation for the one-loop box into a double sum over residues and re-sum into
a two-parameter Euler integral,
• 3 we review bivariate intersection theory and apply it to the one-loop box,
• 4 we derive two four-parameter Euler-integrals for the parts of the MB representation (50) of the double
box, construct Pfaffian equations and solve these in terms of Goncharov logarithms. We reproduce the
symbol [11, 12] of (5),
• 5 we use a parameter shift to substantially simplify the latter computation falling upon the same functions
and symbols.
Finally, we present some conclusions. Appendix A reviews how to build MB representations. Formula (50)
is derived there. Appendix B collects the intersection matrices, higher connections, and Pfaffian matrices
for the shorter computation of Section 5. Bulkier expressions are relegated to the ancillary material to this
publication, i.e. the same items for the longer computation of Section 4, and the functions and symbols for
the two parts (which agree between the two versions of the calculation) composing that of the double box.

Euler integrals for the off-shell one-loop box

The integration domains for both MB parameters are straight lines parallel to the imaginary axis. With the
aim of stating the basic steps of the approach and the relevant formulae we include a derivation of (6) in
Appendix A.
One can close both integration contours to the right, or one to the right and one to the left, leading to
three distinct series expansions of I1 in {u, v}, {u/v, 1/v}, {1/u, v/u}, respectively. Closing both contours to
the right we pick residues from Γ[−z1]2Γ[−z2]2, so z1, z2 →n1, n2 for integer ni. The position of the real part
of the original straight line integrations determines the starting values for the sums over n1, n2. The package

These negative real parts imply that zero is included, thus n1, n2 ∈N0. Given that

closing both contours to the right we find the expansion

The differentiation in the parameters γ, δ was introduced because both poles are double.
Note that the undifferentiated sum on the rhs. of the last equation at γ = 0 = δ is the double Taylor
expansion of 1/

as one may numerically check on truncations. It is simple to re-sum at u = v which suggests the estimate

8; the exact region of convergence is larger but unknown to us. Importantly, since a non-
vanishing domain of convergence exists we will freely swap differentiation over summation/integration in the
following. This assumption is, of course, quite non-trivial and will be justified only a posteriori by the success
of our exercise.
The n1 and n2 sums in (9) both individually yield hypergeometric 3F2 functions, for instance

1These conclusions are not hard to reach for I1.
We introduce MBresolve.m here because it will become relevant to the
application of Barnes’ Lemmata for the simplification of the MB representation of I2, see Appendix A.
