effect in CrSBr (Fig. S15)39. At large magnetic fields along the b-axis of CrSBr, the spins 
start to rotate perpendicular to the b-axis, leading to the rotating of effective in-plane 
magnetic fields to be perpendicular to the currents. 
Conclusion and outlook 
Thanks to the atomistic spin engineering capabilities in vdW antiferromagnets, we 
can unambiguously modulate the intrinsic net magnetic moment parallel to the Néel vector 
in FCGT by tuning the even/odd parity of vdW layers. We achieve the current-induced 180° 
switching of Néel vector in the heterostructure of Pt/FCGT with odd-number vdW layers. 
Combing with theoretical macrospin models, we reveal a layer-dependent parity effect that 
governs the switching dynamics and establish a universal SOT switching mechanism for 
collinear antiferromagnets. Moreover, by constructing a heterostructure comprising of 
CrSBr flake with in-plane easy axis, the interlayer exchange coupling between two 
antiferromagnets helps to form noncollinear interfacial spin textures and breaks the mirror 
symmetry, leading to the performance of field-free switching. These results are ascribed to 
the atomically exfoliable nature of vdW antiferromagnets, which is inaccessible in 
conventional thin-film antiferromagnets (Supplementary Note 13). Though the Néel 
temperature of the model vdW antiferromagnet FCGT implemented in our experiments is 
below room temperature, this paradigm for manipulating antiferromagnetic order is 
applicable to other vdW antiferromagnets with high Néel temperatures41-43 and large-scale 
synthesis capability44 (Supplementary Note 14). Moreover, the vdW antiferromagnet can 
exhibit very large tunnelling magnetoresistance, providing an electrical mean of the 
reliable reading of Néel vector45-47. The integration of field-free SOT switching and 
tunnelling magnetoresistance promise the development of high-performance all-vdW, all-
antiferromagnet memory devices.
