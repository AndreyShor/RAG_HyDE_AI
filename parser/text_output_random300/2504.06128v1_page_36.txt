Instead of (1.30), we impose the weaker condition that, for some c1

(5.3)
where RLpφ, φq is defined in (2.6). The fact that (5.3) is indeed implied by (1.30) (when
(5.2) holds) is shown in the next result, proved in Appendix B.1.
Lemma 5.1. If a probability mass function φ fullfills (5.2), there exists c “ cp ˆt , c1q ą 0
such that

(5.4)
and hence condition (1.30) implies condition (5.3).
We also require condition (1.32), that is boundedness of the variance of the point-to-plane
partition function Zβ
Lpφq “ Zβ
Lpφ, 1q, which we recall here for convenience:
VarrZβ
Lpφqs ď c3 .
(5.5)
We stress that we impose no assumption on ψ in Zβ
Lpφ, ψq.
We can now state our strengthened moment bound, which generalises Theorem 1.11.
Theorem 5.2 (Strengthened general moment bound). Given h P N and ˆt , c1, c1

c3 P p0, 8q, there exist constants Lh, Ch ă 8 (depending also on ˆt , c1, c1

uniformly for β P r0, β0s, L ě Lh, for probability mass functions φ and z0 P Z2 satisfying
(5.2), (5.3) and (5.5), and for arbitrary function ψ. Furthermore:
‚ z0 in (5.6) (from (5.2)) can be replaced by the mean mφ of φ (see (1.28));
‚ the bound (5.6) still holds if, on the LHS, we replace Zβ
Lpφ, ψq by its restriction to
any subset of random walk paths in its definition (5.1).
The rest of this section is devoted to proving Theorem 5.2.
5.1. Preliminary lemmas. We collect here some technical lemmas that will be useful
in the proof. We first show that, for any probability mass function φ satisfying condition
(5.2), we have a uniform lower bound on RL{2pφ, φq. The proof is given in Appendix B.2.
Lemma 5.3. Given ˆt, c1 P p0, 8q, there exists η ą 0 (depending on ˆt, c1) such that, for any
probability mass function φ satisfying (5.2) with constants ˆt and c1, we have
RL{2pφ, φq ě η .
(5.7)
We next show that the assumptions of Theorem 5.2 force β to be at most critical. To this
purpose, recalling (1.15) and (1.19), we have the equivalence for any ϑ P R, as L Ñ 8,
