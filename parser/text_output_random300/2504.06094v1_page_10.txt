4.2. Subalgebra from change transporters. Now, given the deﬁnition of charge trans-
porters, we will consider subalgebras deﬁned by them, and introduce a condition on our abstract
spin chain which guarantees the charge transporters locally generate the quasi-local algebra.
Deﬁnition 4.8. We deﬁne C0 ⊂A to be C∗-subalgebra generated by B0 and the elements ⟨ξ|η⟩
for ξ ∈X−and η ∈X+, for all DHR-bimodules X.
Proposition 4.9. The algebra C0 is linearly spanned by ⟨X−|X+⟩for X ∈DHR(A•).
Proof. We have B0 ⟨X−|X+⟩⊂⟨X−|X+⟩by the A±-bimodule property of X± and the consis-
tency of inner product. The self-adjointness of the linear span of ⟨X−|X+⟩comes from the fact
that DHR(A•) is closed under duality, so that we can write
⟨ξ|η⟩∗= ⟨η|ξ⟩= ⟨¯ξ|¯η⟩
using the vectors ¯ξ, ¯η ∈X∗corresponding to ξ and η.
It remains to prove that, when X and Y are DHR bimodules, we can ﬁnd bases (ξ1
i )i, (ξ2
j )j,
(η1
k)k, and (η2
l )l localized in some intervals F X
1 , F Y
1 ⊂(−∞, −1] and F X
2 , F Y
2 ⊂[0, ∞) such that
the charge transporters for some DHR bimodule Z contains the products ⟨η1
k|η2
l ⟩⟨ξ1
i |ξ2
j ⟩.
We claim that Z = X ⊠A Y will do. Take F Y
1 to the left of F X
1 , and F Y
2 to the right of F X
2 .
Then ⟨ξ1
i |ξ2
j ⟩will commute with both η1
k and η2
l . We thus have
⟨ξ1
i ⊠η1
k|ξ2
j ⊠η2
l ⟩= ⟨η1
k| ⟨ξ1
i |ξ2
j ⟩η2
l ⟩= ⟨η1
k|η2
l ⟩⟨ξ1
i |ξ2
j ⟩,
establishing the claim.

Now, let us consider the following conditions.
Condition 4.10 (Charge-transporter generation). The algebra C0 agrees with A.
Instead of cutting at 0, we can consider the cut at a diﬀerent integer x ∈Z.
Condition 4.11. Let Cx ⊂A be the subalgebra linearly spanned by ⟨X(−∞,x−1]|X[x,∞)⟩for the
DHR bimodules X. Then Cx agrees with A.
Another variation, which we do not use, would be the following.
Condition 4.12. Let I = [c, d] ⊂Z be an interval. Consider the subalgebra CI,k of A[−k,k]
generated by AI, A[−k,−c−1], A[d+1,k], the charge transporters of DHR bimodules X with respect
to bases (ξi)i and (ξ′
j)j, localized in I and [d+1, k], and the charge transporters of X with respect
to bases (ηi)i and (η′
j)j, localized in [−k, −c−1] and I. For long enough I (we will take |I| > 3L)
and big enough k (we will take k > |I| + L), the algebra CI,k agrees with A[−k,k].
This corresponds to the assumption in [M¨ug99, Corollary 4.3].
While it seems a natural
requirement, there might be some counterexample of abstract spin chains with this property in
the line of Remark 3 following [M¨ug99, Corollary 4.3]. In particular, can we produce a nontrivial
decomposition of the form (5.1) from this observation?
Proposition 4.13. Suppose that A• satisﬁes charge-transporter generation, Condition 4.10.
Then there is a surjective B0-bimodule homomorphism of the form
M
i
(Xi)−⊗(Yi)+ →A
for some DHR bimodules (Xi)i and (Yi)i.
Proof. Given Y , we have a B0-bimodule map (Y ∗
−) ⊗Y+ →A given by the natural pairing
η∗
1 ⊗η2 7→⟨η1|η2⟩.
By assumption and Proposition 4.9, there are DHR bimodules (Yi)i such that the subspaces
⟨(Yi)−|(Yi)+⟩⊂A linearly span A.
