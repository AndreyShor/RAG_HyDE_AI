a new loop γ′
2. Note that γ′
2 ⊂Bri makes A(i −1) occur, and γ′
2 ∩γ3 ̸= ∅makes A(i)
occur.
By requiring all the other clusters made by the remaining unexplored loops in Lri+1 to have
diameter smaller than δri/100 (which occurs with positive probability depending only on δ),
we conclude P( ¯
A(i)) ≤b(δ) P( e
A(i)) in this case.
• Case (2b): There is a ball B2δri(z) with z ∈∂Bri such that B2δri(z) ∩C′
1 ̸= ∅and (C′
1 ∪
B2δri(z)) ∩Λ(η2 ∪J(2δri), Lri) ̸= ∅. In this case, there exists a point w ∈J, measurable with
respect to Lri ∪{γ2}, such that the following event occurs
H(z, w) := {either B2δri(z) or B2δri(w) is not surrounded by any loop in Lri+1}.
To be more precise, we will choose the previous possible z, w to be the ones that are closest to
the rightmost point (ri, 0). On the one hand, we have the uniform estimate that P(H(z, w)) ≤
δc for some constant c > 0 (by considering surrounding loops inside dyadic annuli). On the
other hand, we note that Lri ∪{γ2} already makes the occurrence of two crossing clusters of
Aε,ri−1, and hence, by slightly adapting the proof of Lemma 4.6, we can resample the loops
in Lri ∪{γ2} with some positive cost such that A(i −1) happens. Combined, we obtain an
upper bound δc P(A(i −1)) in this case.
Combining the estimates in all the above cases, we conclude the proof of Lemma 4.8.
Recall that the extension probability ms(δ; ε, Ls) and the quality Qε(Ls) were defined in (4.2)
and (4.3), respectively. In what follows, ε is considered as fixed, so we drop it from the notation,
and we write ms(δ) := ms(δ; ε, Ls) and Q(s) := Qε(Ls) for any ε ≤s ≤r, for simplicity. Note that
both ms(δ) and Q(s) are measurable with respect to the loop soup Ls in Bs.
Lemma 4.9. For all θ > 0, there exists ρ(θ) > 0 such that for all i,
P(0 < Q(ri) < ρ, e
A(i)) ≤θ P(A(i −1)).
Proof. We first sample Lri such that both A(i −1) and 0 < Q(ri) < ρ occur. To realize e
A(i), there
exists a δ-good pair of loops (γ1, γ2) inside the collection Lri+1 \ Lri for some δ > 0, which extend
two clusters in Lri across Aε,ri−1 to ∂Bri disjointly. We first assume that (γ1, γ2) is not ρ-good at
scale ri, that is, (4.1) fails to hold for any pair of excursions (η1, η2) in Bri extracted from (γ1, γ2).
As we already argued in case (2b) of the proof of Lemma 4.8, the probability that Bρri(z) with
z ∈∂Bri is not surrounded by a loop in Lri+1 is bounded by ρc. Hence, the probability that the
previous event holds for all endpoints z of η1 and η2 (which is implied by e
A(i)) is uniformly bounded
by 4ρc, which gives the desired upper bound in this case. On the other hand, since Q(ri) < ρ, we
have mri(ρ) < ρ by (4.3). Therefore, the probability of existence of a ρ-good pair of loops is smaller
than ρ. This finishes the proof, by picking θ = 4ρc + ρ.
Lemma 4.10. There is a constant u > 0 such that the following holds. For any ρ > 0, there is a
constant v(ρ) > 0 such that for all i,
P(Q(ri+1) ≥u) ≥v(ρ) P(Q(ri) ≥ρ).
