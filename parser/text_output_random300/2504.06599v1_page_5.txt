η′ are real
dimension-one constant parameters and ϕ and ϕ′ are independent CP violating phases.
We rewrite the texture of the down-type quark mass matrix as
M (A1)
d
=


0
a
0
a′
beiϕ
c
a′′
c′eiϕ′
d

,
(4)
where b = κBη and c′ = κ′C′
η′, and all parameters are real. We see that the determinant of this
matrix is indeed real !
We see the textures of the down-type quark mass matrices for the type A2 and A3 as :
M (A2)
d
=


0
0
a
a′
c
beiϕ
a′′
d
c′eiϕ′


and
M (A3)
d
=


The matrices M (A2)
d
and M (A3)
d
are given by the exchanges of the second and third columns,
and the first and second columns of M (A1)
d
, respectively. Thus, we emphasize here that the
CKM matrix and mass eigenvalues are the same among M (A1)
d
, M (A2)
d
and M (A3)
d
. Hence, all
parameters in those matrices obtained from the experimental data are the same. We present,
in Table 2, the numerical values for each parameters derived from the experimental data on the
quark masses and the CKM matrix elements [4], where we have taken the 2σ error bars for the
experimental data.

The number of parameters in the up- and down-type quark mass matrices is twelve, but the
observable parameters are the six quark masses and the four CKM matrix elements. Therefore,
two parameters must be redundant. This is the reason why only the difference between the
phases ϕ and ϕ′ is constrained as seen in Table 2. In addition, it is also the reason why the
