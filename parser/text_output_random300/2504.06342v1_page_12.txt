Figure 2. Time evolution of the AGN luminosity (blue, scaled on the left y-axis) and specific star formation rate
(orange, scaled on the right y-axis), superposed with 𝐿bh/𝐿Edd = 2% (dashed line), above (below) which the AGN
feedback enters the cold (hot) mode. Both quantities fluctuate over time by orders of magnitude, with occasional bursts
of activity when the AGN feedback enters the cold mode (𝐿BH ≥2 × 10−2𝐿Edd). The AGN luminosity and the specific
star formation rate exhibit strong positive correlation temporally.
minosity predominantly maintains a relatively low
level of 𝐿BH/𝐿Edd ∼10−5, punctuated by episodic
bursts where 𝐿BH/𝐿Edd exceeds 10−2, triggering
cold-mode AGN feedback.
The sSFR evolution exhibits two distinct states
while remaining consistently below 10−12 yr−1, in-
dicating the galaxy’s quiescent nature. During the
“low state”, associated with hot-mode AGN feed-
back, the sSFR demonstrates a systematic increase
from 10−16 yr−1 to 10−12 yr−1 over approximately
100 Myr timescales, likely reflecting gradual cold
gas accumulation.
The “high state”, coinciding
with cold-mode AGN feedback, is characterized by
elevated sSFR levels of several 10−12 yr−1, occa-
sionally exceeding 10−11 yr−1 at onset. These high-
state episodes typically persist for approximately
10 Myr before rapidly declining to low-state val-
ues.
A striking feature is the strong temporal corre-
lation between AGN luminosity and sSFR, sug-
gesting shared dependence on available gas sup-
ply.
Despite this positive correlation, evidence
of AGN’s negative feedback on star formation re-
mains apparent:
although sSFR initially spikes
above 10−11 yr−1 during high states, it promptly
stabilizes at ∼10−12 yr−1 under cold-mode AGN
feedback, maintaining the galaxy’s quiescent state.
The sharp sSFR decline concluding each high state
likely reflects cold gas depletion through intense
AGN feedback. We note that although the power-
ful cold mode seems to dominate the star formation
activity during the bursts, the hot mode is at least
equally important in regulating the cool gas forma-
tion and suppressing the star formation over longer
timescales. This will be further investigated in a
separate work.
The AGN duty cycle manifests as periodic bursts
of 𝐿BH/𝐿Edd ≳10−2 occurring at intervals of tens
to hundreds of Myr, coincident with rapid central
gas inflows.
Notably, while our model permits
super-Eddington accretion, no such events are ob-
served throughout the simulation.
These results
collectively demonstrate the intricate coupling be-
tween AGN activity and star formation, which we
examine in greater detail in subsequent sections.
3.2. Spatial distribution of gas properties: at
galactic halo scales
We next examine the spatial distribution of key
gas properties – number density 𝑛H, temperature,
and radial velocity – at galactic halo scales. Fig. 3
presents polar-view projections of these quantities
within a 100 kpc radius at different evolutionary
stages characterized by varying AGN luminosi-
ties. The panels show volume-weighted number
density (top), mass-weighted temperature (middle),
