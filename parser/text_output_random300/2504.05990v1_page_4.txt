either ‘normal’ or diseased tissue. Traditional radiomics features include morphological features, 
such as aortic knob diameter from chest radiographs, which can be used to evaluate early changes 
of the aortic structure,24 and texture features, such as those describing breast parenchymal texture 
on otherwise ‘normal’ screening mammograms.25 The biological relevance of radiomic features 
has been demonstrated in pre-clinical animal studies for their ability to characterize changes in 
tissue compared to controls, e.g., in lung tissue due to environmental toxin exposure26 or fibrotic 
remodeling,27 and excess deposition of extracellular matrix in the liver.28 Some small preliminary 
studies have also observed differences in the image-based appearance of tissue by demographic 
attributes that correlate with SDOH, e.g.,29–31, contributing to the new fields of socioradiomics and 
socioradiogenomics.32  
Using ‘big data’ of medical imaging to contribute to HD research could establish a completely 
new paradigm, resulting in its direct inclusion in the toolbox of resources to identify and monitor 
HDs of populations (Figure 1), allowing HD researchers to discover associations between 
radiomic phenotypes and SDOH-related phenotypes.
