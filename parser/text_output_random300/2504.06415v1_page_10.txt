Pair Completeness (Section 2.4)
Note— For each pair, the DR16Q quasar is designated as index 1 and
the companion as index 2, regardless of their brightness, which means
the quasar may sometimes be dimmer than its companion, particularly
when the pair separation is large. Gaia measurements are from DR3 (null
values are masked). The column “REFERENCE” provides the source
papers for the identified pairs, including those selected through previous
studies and confirmed via follow-up observations. The matched lensed
quasars from the Gravitationally Lensed Quasar Database (Lemon et al.
2019) are all labeled as “Lemon2019”, even when the lensed quasars were
originally collected from other literature sources rather than directly
from Lemon et al. (2019). The column “PCA TYPE” refers to the PCA
classification results for pairs at separations of < 1.′′5 (the PCA results
for pairs at larger separations are masked), while the column “TYPE”
indicates the final pair classification. “QQ” refers to a double quasar,
“QS PM” refers to a quasar+star pair based on proper motion, and
“QS PCA” refers to a quasar+star pair based on spectral PCA; one
quasar (J0033+2015) is a known quasar+star pair (More et al. 2016),
and we set its TYPE = “QS KNOWN”. The associated FITS file is
available in the online version of this paper.
