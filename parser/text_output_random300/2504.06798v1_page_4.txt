to π. To validate the interpretation of the ENDOR data
and explicitly demonstrate that our experiment probes
the distant in-plane N(3) nuclear spins, we present the
results of DFT calculations. The calculations were car-
ried out for the V −
B placed in a 10 × 10 hBN monolayer
(200 atoms) using the GIPAW module of the Quantum
ESPRESSO software [31, 32], PBE exchange-correlation
functional [33], norm-conserving pseudopotentials [34],
and a plane-wave basis set with 600 eV kinetic energy
cutoff. The results summarized in Fig. 4 show that the
hyperfine couplings do not merely depend on the distance
from the vacancy but are determined by the spin density
distribution. As demonstrated in Fig. 4a, the spin den-
sity distribution is, in turn, defined by the atomic struc-
ture and chemical bonding pattern.
As a result, both
the isotropic and dipolar HF coupling are stronger for
the third nitrogen shell, N(3), than for the second one (cf.

represent experimental and theoretical values, respectively.
Isotropic and anisotropic parts of the HF are determined as
follows: Aiso = (Axx + Ayy + Azz)/3, Add = (2Azz −Axx −
Ayy)/6. For the resultung values for the first seven shells, see

Fig. 4b). Starting from the fourth shell, the HF couplings
further decrease compared to N(3). This observation is
in line with the HF values reported in [25]. The HF and
NQ coupling constants calculated for N(3) and listed in
Table I are found to be in very good agreement with the
experimentally determined values, thus confirming the
identification of the ENDOR results. Finally, in agree-
ment with the experiment, the zz principal direction of
the HF tensor of N(3) is perpendicular to the c-axis and
tilted by 15◦from that of the N(1) nucleus (Fig. 4c).
In this Letter, we demonstrate the first steps toward
studying and reading out remote nuclear spins in hBN
with the central V −
B S = 1 electron spin. Building on
recent advances in utilizing the V −
B defect as a quantum
sensor [16–20], our demonstration broadens the applica-
tion of this defect to sensing distant nuclear spins. We
emphasize that understanding and uncovering the nu-
clear spin system in hBN requires relatively high mag-
netic fields and microwave frequencies. These conditions
are essential for isolating and accurately identifying dif-
ferent nuclear spin groups, leveraging nuclear Zeeman in-
teractions to achieve spectral separation. This approach
lays the groundwork for coherent control and potential
selective population transfer from the V −
B electron spin
system to nuclear spin rings associated with nitrogen and
boron isotopes surrounding the vacancy.
The latter is
key to implementing hBN’s nuclear sublattices for future
quantum simulators. [21–23, 35].
