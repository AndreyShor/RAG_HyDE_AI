we take Planck mission’s central value Ne = 57, we get rStarob ≃0.0037. However, if the Weyl-
squared term is non-negligible we could have different values. Indeed, a future measurement of
the tensor-to-scalar ratio will directly fix the value of m2 (i.e. c2). This means that quadratic
gravity will then be able to provide sharp predictions for the other cosmological parameters such
us the running of the scalar spectral index and the tensor tilt nt. The latter, at leading order,
satisfies the consistency relation nt ≃−r/8 [136–138].
Although m2 (i.e. c2) is a free parameter whose value cannot be predicted and must be fixed
by observations, from a high-energy physics point of view we might expect the effects of the
spin-two ghost to become important at energies of the order or higher than the scalaron mass,
m2 ≳m0 (i.e. c2 ≲c0).
Taking the range (m0, ∞) as the possible allowed values for m2, then quadratic gravity would
give the following narrow window for the tensor-to-scalar ratio (17):

N2e
≲r ≲12

(18)
In particular, for Ne = 57 we get 0.0025 ≲r ≲0.0037.
Values of m2 lower than m0 have also been considered in the literature. For example, if the
spin-two ghost is quantized as a fakeon, the consistency of the quantization prescription requires
m2 ≥m0/4, so the lower bound in (18) would be replaced by 4/(3N2
e ) which for Ne = 57 gives
0.0004 [136]. Even smaller values have been considered in [50, 137]. A measured value of the
tensor-to-scalar ratio less than O(1)/N2
e would, in principle, not rule out the theory. However, if
quadratic gravity is a consistent UV completion of Starobinsky’s model, then we would expect
the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio to be close to Starobinsky’s prediction.
The current observational constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio comes from the Planck
mission and reads r ≲0.032 (95% CL) [139,140]. Interestingly, we are only one order of magnitude
away from Starobinsky’s prediction and our expectations for quadratic gravity. Actually, future
observations [141–146] will look for values of the order of r ∼O(10−3), which is exactly what is
needed to test quadratic gravity as a UV completion of Starobinsky’s model.
Some of the observational missions are expected to be launched in the next ten years or so.
Therefore, in the near future we will be able to say whether Nature favors quadratic gravity as
a physically viable extension of GR. If confirmed, this would be a spectacular new success of the
QFT framework and the strict renormalizability paradigm!
As mentioned in the previous section, some form of causality is expected to be violated for
time intervals ∆t ≲M2
p/m3
2 ≲M2
p/m3
0 ∼10−28 s due to the presence of the spin-two ghost.
This time scale may be much larger than the duration of inflation (about 10−36 s), so future
investigations are certainly needed to see whether microscopic acausal effects could leave some
kind of imprint on the CMB correlations [45,88].
