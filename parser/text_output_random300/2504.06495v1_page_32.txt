behavior in Theorem 2 to remain unchanged, because as ǫ →0, the ﬂuctuations Vt become
negligible compared to the diverging distance between the initial condition and the average
barrier log ǫ.

Endogenously determined truncation threshold

Main idea
Let’s revisit the basic branching model with truncation deﬁned in equation (6).
In our
analysis in Section 3, two aspects appeared rather arbitrary: the choice of exogenous threshold
ξt = ǫ αt and the parameter tuning required to ensure β = 1 in Theorem 1. We now address
both issues by modifying the model such that the threshold ξt becomes a function of the
entire multiverse’s branching process at time t.
An important distinction: In Section 3, we analyzed the branching process starting from
a single coherent branch at time t = 0 (or by comparing two such branches with diﬀerent
initial amplitudes φa and φb), treating t = 0 as the moment our experiment occurred. Now,
we examine the branching process of the entire multiverse, which began much earlier, with
the trees in Section 3 representing only small subtrees. The underlying branching mechanism
remains unchanged, and Figure 3 still applies. However, the key diﬀerence is that we now
consider ψ0 at t = 0 as the initial state of the entire multiverse, while our experiment takes
place much later, when the overall process has reached a “steady state”.
Following our established notation, at time t, all possible branches (surviving and termi-
nated) of the multiverse are labeled by states in the set {1, . . . , K}t, with φt(b) representing
the squared amplitude of branch b ∈{1, . . . , K}t. Let B+
t = {b ∈{1, . . . , K}t : φt(b) > 0} be
the set of branches that have not been terminated by time t. We then propose the following
endogenous threshold rule:
ξt =

|B+

where |B+
t | denotes the cardinality of B+
t . Thus, we set ξt equal to the average squared
