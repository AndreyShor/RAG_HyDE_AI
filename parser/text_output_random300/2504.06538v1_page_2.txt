long-horizon coherence and physical consistency, as well
as planning for the execution of complex, multi-step tasks.
We introduce OPAL, a transformer-based architecture that
addresses these limitations through a principled approach
to action generation based on topological field theories.
Our key insight is that complex action sequences exhibit
topological structure analogous to string-net models in
condensed matter physics, where local constraints deter-
mine global behavior. By incorporating these constraints
into our flow matching framework, we achieve more co-
herent and physically plausible action sequences.
Our primary contributions are:
1. A novel topological attention mechanism that en-
forces physical consistency constraints through fu-
sion rules,
2. An enhanced flow matching framework with topo-
logical constraints for action generation,
3. A hierarchical action representation that reduces the
search space for more efficient and effective plan-
ning,
4. An improved integration technique using fourth-
order Runge-Kutta methods that reduces computa-
tional requirements while improving accuracy.
We evaluate OPAL on 10 complex robotic manipulation
tasks and demonstrate that it achieves performance com-
parable to fine-tuned π0 models without requiring task-
specific optimization, while significantly outperforming
previous approaches.
The performance patterns across
different task categories provide valuable insights into
the strengths of our topological approach, particularly for
tasks involving complex environmental manipulation.

The integration of vision, language, and action for robotic
control systems enables an unprecedented level of au-
tonomous interaction and comprehension within dis-
tinct environments. Vision-language-action (VLA) mod-
els represent a rapidly evolving field with several dis-
tinct innovation strategies, yielding significant progress in
robotic control systems in recent years. One of these novel
strategies, Octo [27], pioneered the integration of large
language models (LLMs) with vision encoders for robotic
manipulation. While successful in performing single-step
actions, Octo demonstrated a significant reduction in ap-
titude when generalizing to long-horizon tasks, such as
sorting items or folding laundry.
OpenVLA [15] im-
proved on this foundation by incorporating more struc-
tured representations to enhance action comprehension
and planning in robotic systems, but failed to guarantee
the physical feasibility of executing such plans. Most re-
cently, π0 [2] introduced flow matching techniques for ac-
tion generation, refining the fluidity and adaptability of
robotic interactions within their environment.
The evolution of VLA architectures can be traced back
to foundational work in imitation learning approaches,
like BC-Z [12] and VIMA [13], which established early
frameworks for multi-modal robotic control. These mod-
els demonstrated the feasibility of learning control poli-
cies directly from demonstration data but were limited by
their inability to generalize beyond training distributions.
A significant paradigm shift occurred with RT-1 [4] and
RT-2 [3], which introduced transformer-based architec-
tures capable of processing multiple input modalities si-
multaneously. These models enabled more flexible adap-
tation to novel tasks but still relied heavily on task-specific
demonstrations to successfully replicate such actions. The
subsequent development of PaLM-E [8] and RT-X [6]
broadened the scope by incorporating large-scale pre-
training on diverse datasets, significantly improving zero-
shot generalization capabilities across robotic platforms.
Parallel developments focused on incorporating reason-
ing capabilities into robotic control. SayCan [1] and Inner
Monologue [10] introduced explicit reasoning steps be-
tween perception and action generation, allowing robots
to decompose complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks.
This reasoning-centered approach was further refined
through the developments of LISA [16] and ProgPrompt
[25], which formulated the control problem as a hierarchi-
cal planning process guided by natural language prompts.
The use of large multi-modal foundation models for
robotic control represents another significant research di-
rection. CLIP-fields [20] and ViNT [24] pioneered the
application of vision-language alignment for robotic nav-
igation, while subsequent works such as VoxPoser [11]
and DROID [14] extended these principles to manipula-
tion tasks. These approaches leverage the rich semantic
understanding of pre-trained vision-language models but
struggle with the physical precision required for complex
manipulation within an environment.
Recent efforts have focused on addressing the challenge
of physical consistency in action generation.
GATO
[23] and RT-2-X [3, 6] employed large-scale behavioral
cloning across diverse embodiments to implicitly learn the
bounding mechanical limitations of unique robotic config-
urations and environmental interactions. ManipLLM [19]
and ROSIE [29] introduced explicit physical consistency
losses during training, improving performance on contact-
rich tasks. Despite enabling substantial advancements in
action generation methodologies, these approaches lack
formal guarantees about the physical plausibility of gen-
