computing angles which implement the target unitary.
An m-mode interferometer is said to be universal if
any unitary in U(m), the set of unitaries of dimension
m, can be implemented.
Since the structure is fixed, an integrated universal
m-mode interferometer can only be optimal in the
worst-case scenario. Whilst some unitaries in U(m) can
be implemented with a smaller interferometer, some
can’t. Still, we can extend the notion of optimality to
the compilation process when one wants to compute
the angles required to implement a given unitary.
A
depth-optimal compiler would return the shallowest
implementation within the interferometer, with the
following layers set to the identity. Whilst these layers
will nevertheless be executed on the chip, they can be
useful for mitigating errors [16].
B.
Boson Sampling
Boson sampling is the task of sampling from the out-
put distribution of an m mode interferometer imple-
menting a Haar random unitary with n input photons
[1].
There is strong evidence that performing boson
sampling on n > 50 photons with n << m is sufficient
to reach quantum utility [17]. Without loss of general-
ity we can assume that our n input photons enter the
first n modes. To implement boson sampling, the in-
terferometer only needs to implement the images of the
first n creation operators. In other words, given those
images in a m × n matrix V , any unitary U ∈U(m)
implementable by the interferometer such that

is a valid implementation of the desired boson
sampling experiment.
An m-mode interferometer is
said to be universal for n-photon boson sampling if for
any set of n orthonormal columns V ∈Cm×n there
exists an operator U implementable on the chip such
that Eq. 1 holds.

Unitary decomposition schemes
Here we review previous decomposition schemes. We
assume perfect beamsplitters. For works on imperfect
beamsplitters, we refer the readers to, e.g., [10, 18–22].

QR-based schemes
Schemes based on the QR decomposition [23] work
by zeroing the entries of U sequentially until one is
left with a triangular matrix.

FIG. 2: The process to zero an arbitrary U using
Reck’ scheme. Each box/MZI has two numbers i, j
giving the entry Uij that is zeroed with this block.
Once all MZIs have been applied, U is diagonal and
can be synthesized with a layer of phase-shifters.
to zero an arbitrary entry of U based on Property 1.
Therefore one can construct a circuit composed of
MZIs to progressively zero the entries of U.
If the
zeroing is done in a good order, in the sense that one
zeroing does not break the zeroing of another entry,
this performs a QR decomposition of U.
Triangular unitary matrices are diagonal, so once U
is triangular, a layer of phase-shifters can reduce U
to the identity.
Taking the inverse of the operations
gives a valid circuit for implementing U.
Up to the
diagonal matrix of m parameters implemented by the
layer of phase-shifters, a unitary matrix of size m is
parameterized by m(m −1) real parameters.
As our
MZIs have two phase-shifters, m(m−1)/2 are necessary
for universality. Regarding the depth, at most m −1
non-overlapping MZIs can be executed in two time
steps, so the optimal MZI depth for a universal chip is
2m(m−1)
2(m−1) = m.
Two main strategies for zeroing the entries of U are
proposed in the literature:
• Reck et al.’s scheme [8] zeroes all the elements of
one column of U at a time. The process is repre-
sented in Fig 2. This scheme requires m(m−1)/2
MZIs, and the depth is 2m−3. This is optimal in
number of MZIs but not in depth.
• Clements et al.’s scheme [9] is described by the cir-
cuit in Fig. 3. Each diagonal layer of MZIs is used
to zero one subdiagonal of U and we alternate be-
tween operations on the rows and the columns of
U to do the zeroing in a shallow way. The layer of
phase-shifters needed to implement the diagonal,
initially between the left and right circuits, can be
postponed to the end of the circuit using commu-
tation rules. Inverting and merging the left and
right circuits gives an circuit which is optimal in
both the number of components and depth.
