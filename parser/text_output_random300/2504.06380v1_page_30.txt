: Effect of temperature of the Mixing Chamber (MC) plate with B|| sweep
The measured TBG sample is connected to a cold finger made out of copper sitting inside a sample puck
as we have shown in SI-Fig. 1 (section SI- 1). The sample is cooled to the measurement (base) tempera-
ture through the wirings around the cold finger to thermally equilibrate to the mixing chamber (MC) plate
temperature of the cryo-free dilution refrigerator connecting the leads (legs) of the chip carrier to the MC
plate of the dilution fridge. The ‘bath’ temperature or the MC plate temperature could be read out through
a Ruthenium oxide (RoxTM) temperature sensor. It has been seen that, there is an increase in the bath (MC
plate) temperature, TMC, whenever the magnetic field is swept/ramped in either direction of the B fields.
For example, say we switch on the magnet and ramp up to +300 mT with a ramp rate of 100 mT/min, TMC
rises to ∼72 mK from the base operation temperature of ∼20−25 mK. Throughout this report, all the data
presented here for B|| sweep hysteresis has been obtained for the ramp rate of 100 mT/min unless otherwise
mentioned. We have tried to see if such a change of TMC with a continuous B|| sweep has any effect on
the observed nature of BMR response and ∆Rxx magnitude at different ν. In the similar spirit to RFW

and
RBW
xx
(as defined in main text), T FW
MC and T BW
MC are plotted in SI-Fig. 3 for different values of ν. T FW
MC
and T BW
MC are the profile of the MC plate temperature, TMC, for forward and backward B|| sweep directions
respectively. The B|| hysteresis loop path is traced as +B|| →−B|| [i) →ii)], see SI-Fig. 3a (bottom
panel)) and then −B|| →+B|| [ii) →iii)] starting from B|| = +300 mT. As shown in the bottom panels
of SI-Fig. 3a-c, the TMC profile for the ‘forward’ and ‘backward’ sweep are always similar for any choice
of ν irrespective of the nature of BMR (hysteresis or no hysteresis). Also, the temperature increase profile is
monotonic, which does not correlate to the non-monotonic increase or decrease of Rxx vs. B|| curves. We
would also like to point out that the change in TMC is relatively small, ∆T ∼10 −15 mK.

: Evolution of hysteresis phase with temperature
From the observations presented in Figure 2a of the main text, we see that the hysteresis phase resides at
the boundary of the superconducting phase observed in this near magic-angle TBG. Also, when the SC
phase can be tuned to a normal phase by changing the temperature above a critical temperature, Tc, a weak
hysteresis phase emerges from the region deep inside the SC phase (Figure 2c of the main text). The Tc for
the SC phase for the near magic-angle TBG is ∼800 mK at νop ∼2.7 at zero D ?.
As shown in SI-Fig. 4, we plot ∆Rxx with B|| for zero D around the SC region (ν ∼1.5 −3.5) with
increasing sample/bath temperature from 70 mK to 1 K. The two hysteresis ‘islands’ start weakening and
move closer towards each other with increasing T and above T ≈600 mK merge in a single hysteresis phase
in the filling range ν ∼2.2 −3. These observations again highlight the emergence of the hysteresis phase
with a gradual weakening of the SC phase achieved through the increase of the sample (TBG) temperature
above Tc.
