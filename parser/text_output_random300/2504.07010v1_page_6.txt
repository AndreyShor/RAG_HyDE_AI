Paired and unpaired samples
Our approach is related to CP under
random effects Dunn et al. (2018). Similar to here, CP intervals are obtained
from the samples of an underlying black-box generator but are not explicitly
related to distribution distances. Ghosal and Matabuena (2023) provide a
conformal algorithm for when the inputs and outputs are distributions. In
their setup, however, each sample corresponds to a label, i.e. attributes and
labels are paired. Outside the CP framework, techniques to address the 2-
sample problem have been proposed in the statistical literature since 1939
(Smirnov, 1939) and mostly in the non-parametric framework (Gretton et al.,
2012). The only connection between CP and 2-sample tasks is a recent work
on hypothesis testing (Hu and Lei, 2024) (see Section 1.1 for a technical
comparison).
CP for QC
In QC, CP has been used only in Park and Simeone (2023),
which is a direct application of Probabilistic CP Wang et al. (2022).
In
Park and Simeone (2023), the multiple-output setup is avoided because high-
dimensional observables can be handled by performing several separate mea-
surements Caro et al. (2022). The argument in Caro et al. (2022) relates
to the generalization properties of Quantum ML algorithms. It is unclear
whether this is a more fundamental property of Quantum Computing de-
vices.
Quantum Error Mitigation
The problem of hardware noise is handled
with QEM (Cai et al., 2023). Machine Learning (ML) methods have been
used for QEM since 2020. Unlike us, ML-QEM often focuses on inferring
distribution summaries, depends on the underlying error models and requires
changing the target circuit (Harper et al., 2020; Liu and Zhou, 2020; Strikis
et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Canonici et al., 2024; Adeniyi and Kumar,
2025).

The Bhattacharyya Coefficient (BC)
The output of small QC hardware can be reproduced using classical com-
puters, i.e. a simulator where all quantum operations are noise-free. In this
