In contrast, potential-like methods, such as those utilizing empirical energy functions 
like FoldX15 structure-based protein-language models such as ProteinMPNN16 and 
ESM-IF117, and methods that directly address the calculation of ŒîŒîG upon mutation 
using deep neural networks, such as Pythia18, offer faster and more accessible 
alternatives. These methods estimate stability changes by calculating either 
atomistic interactions or the likelihood of an amino acid in a given structural context 
of the protein. Pythia, for example, employs a self-supervised learning framework to 
perform zero-shot ŒîŒîG predictions across a large protein sequence space, offering 
ultrafast computational performance. 
 
 
 
Fig.1 Thermodynamics of the Variation of the folding free energy upon single point mutation, 
considering mutated (m) and wild-type (w) states. In box [1] the relation between probability and free 
energy of folding is reported. In box [2], the correct measure of the difference of the unfolding free 
energy between the mutated and wild-type proteins, considering  the difference between the folded 
and unfolded state is reported (first equation); however, some potential-like methods approximate it 
using the difference of the folding state free energy, neglecting the effect of the unfolded states (box 
[2], second equation). A first approximation can be obtained by adding a mass-balance correction 
(also a kind of solvation term) to the folding free energy difference (box [2], third equation).  
 
 
However, one fundamental limitation of the potential-like methods is their simplified 
approach to Gibbs free energy calculations, where only the folded states {ùê∫ùêπ(ùë•)} (i.e., 
the protein structure) are considered. This simplification leads to the following 
approximation for the mutant (m) and wild-type (w):
