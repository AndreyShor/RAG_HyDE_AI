Analytic study of the moduli space for gcd(k, r) = r
The O(λ0) equations:
The general solution of the O(λ0) equation in (2.20) for W(0)k×ℓwas found in [1]. It is
given in Appendix A and expressed in terms of the functions Φ(p) defined there. Noting that
for gcd(k, r) = r only p = 0 is relevant, we find:
W(0)k×ℓ
2C′C (x) = iW(0)k×ℓ
1C′C (x) = V −1/4CC′
2 Φ(0)
C′C(x) =: W2 C′C ,
W(0)k×ℓ
4C′C (x) = iW(0)k×ℓ
3C′C (x) = V −1/4CC′
4 Φ(0)
C′C(x) =: W4 C′C ,

where CC′
2(4) are yet-to-be-determined complex coefficients, not fixed to the leading order λ0.
The boundary conditions for SCB of eqn. (2.14) imply that S(0)ℓ= 0, since SCB can only
be proportional to the unit matrix. Clearly, then, Sω
µ as well as Sk
µ are constant, and, in
addition, Sk
µ can only be diagonal due to the boundary conditions (2.13). Then, the second
equation in (2.21) implies that the solutions of S(0)k

and S(0)ω

can be combined and are given
by

This is a set of k × k quaternion equations and their consistency can be used to determine

as follows. We simply integrate the diagonal components of the k × k matrix
(taking B′ = C′) of the quaternion equation on T4. Noticing that ¯S(0)kS(0)k = S(0)k

the equation for S(1)ℓ, the second equation in (2.18).
17For gcd(k, r) = r but with k ̸= r, e.g. for k = 2r, the argument has to be modified, since Sµ C′C′ are
now not all periodic, as per the x1 BC in (2.13). This and the general gcd(k, r) case are treated in section 5
in [1] (replacing the r.h.s. of equations (5.3) there with zero, to account for the fact that ∆= 0, leads to the
identical conclusion that W(0) k×ℓ
µ
= 0 as well).
