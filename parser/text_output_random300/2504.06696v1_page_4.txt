FIG. 2. The normalized detuning ∆sd/ωm versus the scaled
bare driving detuning ∆c/ωm and the scaled Kerr constant
χ/ωm when the cavity-field decay rate κa takes different val-
ues: (a) κa/ωm = 0.5, (b) κa/ωm = 0.8, (c) κa/ωm = 1.2, and
(d) κa/ωm = 1.5. Other parameters used are g0/ωm = 0.005,
κb/ωm = 10−5, Ω/ωm = 50, and ¯nth = 0. Here, we also show
the surfaces corresponding to ∆sd/ωm = 1 and ∆sd = ∆c for
comparison.
Nss and Mss depend on the parameters r, re, φ, and θe.
Here, the parameters r and φ have been determined by
Eqs. (12). Since the squeezed vacuum bath characterized
by re and θe is introduced to cancel the noise caused by
two-photon terms in Eq. (10), we can choose proper val-
ues of re and θe such that Nss = 0 and Mss = 0. Then
the bath associated with the cavity field is reduced to a
vacuum bath, which is the minimal bath experienced by
the cavity field.
Below, we analyze how to obtain the solution of re and
θe. In principle, under the given r and φ, we can analyze
the parameters Nss and Mss as functions of θe and re. By
analyzing Eqs. (14), we find that Nss = 0 and Mss = 0
when θe = φ + nπ (n = 1, 3, 5, . . . ) and re = r. It should
be emphasized that Nss = 0 and Mss = 0 imply that
both the thermal noise and the squeezing vacuum noise
have been suppressed completely. This working point is
very important to observe the optomechanical effects at
the single-photon level [41]. This feature is also the mo-
tivation for introducing the squeezing vacuum reservoir,
i.e., using a well-designed squeezing vacuum bath to sup-
press the thermal noise and excitations caused by the
two-photon driving.
Under the condition such that R = 0, Nss = 0, and
Mss = 0, the quantum master equation (9) is reduced to
˙ˆρsd = −i[ ˆ˜Hsd, ˆρsd] + κa ˆD[ˆa]ˆρsd
+ κb(¯nth + 1) ˆD[b]ˆρsd + κb¯nth ˆD[ˆb†]ˆρsd,

FIG. 3. The scaled effective coupling strength Gsd versus the
scaled bare driving detuning ∆c/ωm and the scaled Kerr con-
stant χ/ωm when the cavity-field decay rate κa takes different
values: (a) κa/ωm = 0.5, (b) κa/ωm = 0.8, (c) κa/ωm = 1.2,
and (d) κa/ωm = 1.5.
Other parameters are the same as

where the Hamiltonian takes the form as
ˆ˜Hsd = ∆sdˆa†ˆa + ωmˆb†ˆb + (Gsdˆa† + G∗
sdˆa)(ˆb† + ˆb). (16)
It can be seen from Eq. (16) that, after the squeezing
transformation, the system is reduced to an effective and
typical linearized optomechanical system. Here, ∆sd is
the effective driving detuning and Gsd is the linearized
optomechanical coupling strength. In addition, the cav-
ity field is effectively contacted to a vacuum bath, and
the mechanical resonator is coupled to a heat bath.
For generating optomechanical entanglement, both the
effective detuning ∆sd and the effective coupling strength
Gsd are important parameters. Based on Eqs. (5), (7),
(11), and (12), we can see that both ∆sd and Gsd de-
pend on the displacement parameters and the squeezing
parameters, which are determined by the system parame-
ters. In Fig. 2, we show the dependence of the normalized
detuning ∆sd/ωm on ∆c/ωm and χ/ωm for different val-
ues of κa/ωm in both the sideband resolved and unsolved
regimes. Note that Fig. 2 is plotted only for parameter
sets satisfying the steady-state condition, and that the
blank area represents the region where the steady-state
condition is not met [see Sec. IV(A) for details]. We can
see from Figs. 2(a)-2(d) that the effective driving detun-
ing ∆sd/ωm remains positive for these values of κa/ωm,
indicating that the normalized detuning ∆sd/ωm caused
by both the displacement and squeezing transformations
will move towards the red sideband direction. Namely,
∆sd/ωm becomes positive within some parameter regions
of ∆c < 0. For a fixed ∆c/ωm, the normalized detuning
difference (∆sd −∆c)/ωm increases with the increase of
the parameter χ (as shown by the difference between the
