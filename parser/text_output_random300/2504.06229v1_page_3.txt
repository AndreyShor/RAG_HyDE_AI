from i) the bandwidth of the local oscillator and from ii)
the resolution of a LO shaper or a multipixel detector,
the channel bandwidth in a dense wavelength division
multiplexer (DWDM), etc.
Regarding the coupling, CM is the largest linear cou-
pling strength at the waveguide-array design operat-
ing frequency Ï‰h/2, and fj(Ï‰) are the elements of the
coupling profile âƒ—f.
Considering coupling only between
nearest-neighbor waveguides, a linear waveguide array
â€“Equation 1 with g = 0â€“ presents spatial linear super-
modes Ë†Bk, i.e.
propagation eigenvectors [35].
These
eigenvectors form a basis and are represented by an or-
thogonal matrix M â‰¡M(âƒ—f) with real elements Mk,j.
The linear supermodes are the same for signal and idler
frequencies as long as the coupling profile does not change
in the considered bandwidth âƒ—f Ì¸= âƒ—f(Ï‰). We consider a
SPDC bandwidth âˆ†SPDC where this condition holds and
discuss the validity of this assumption in the Appendix.
The individual modes of the waveguides and the linear
supermode basis are thus related by Ë†Bl

j=1 Mk,j Ë†
Al
j.
These supermodes are orthonormal PN
j=1 Mk,jMkâ€²,j =
Î´k,kâ€², with a spectrum of eigenvalues Î»k â‰¡Î»k(CM, âƒ—f).
Î»k is the propagation constant of the kth linear super-
mode. Recent developments have broken the monolithic
structure of integrated optical lattices enabling the mod-
ification of coupling constant profiles on demand [36, 37].
To simplify the analysis we order the modes in L blocks
composed of N spatial modes in given frequency bands
centered at Ï‰l with the following indices respectively for
the individual and linear spatio-spectral supermodes:
j = j + (l âˆ’1)N,
k = k + (l âˆ’1)N,
with {j, k} = 1, . . . , N and N â‰¡N Ã— L [38]. The indices
are ordered using l: for l = 1 we have j(k) = 1, . . . , N,
for l = 2 we have j(k) = N + 1, . . . , 2N, etc. The linear-
supermode transformation is then

L(z) is a complex matrix which gathers all the informa-
tion about the spatio-spectral shape of the pump and
the phasematching.
The symmetric complex matrices
ËœLk,kâ€² and ËœLl,lâ€² couple respectively the spatial linear su-
permodes and the frexel modes and, as we show below,
propagation couples both. Note the outstanding symme-
try between the two expressions with a change of basis,
a pump function and a phasematching function.
Remarkably, unlike broadband frequency modes, frex-
els preserve local multiplication. If the resolution of the
frexel basis âˆ†âˆ’1
F is large enough, the frequency-dependent
functions are approximately constant within each frexel,
and we can approximate â„¦(Ï‰s + Ï‰i) and âˆ†Î²(Ï‰s, Ï‰i) by
their frexel versions

This coarse-grained
description of the spectral functions can be used to get
insight about the dynamics of the full system although
analytical calculations rigorously hold only for (4).
The symmetries of the supermodes enable solving Eq.
(2) analytically for any gain regime with suitable pump
profiles [39â€“41].
However, in the general case, we can
solve it in the low gain regime where space-ordering ef-
fects can be neglected [42]. Hence, the formal solution to
Equation (2) at given z is written as

j=1 Mk,jMkâ€²,jÎ·j. fk,kâ€²(z) couples pairs of
spatio-spectral modes k and kâ€² and, in particular, the
sinc function couples spatial and spectral DOF. Thus,
the spectral features of the waveguides, the evanescent
coupling profile as well as the spatial and spectral shape
of the pump enable engineering the JSSA. Note that this
matrix contains all information about individual-mode
correlations in the DV regime (Î“(z) <<) through a sim-
ple change of basis in the spatial DOF [22].
Under the high resolution approximation for frexels of
Eqs.

pump and phasematching functions as
