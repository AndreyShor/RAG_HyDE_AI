Figure 2: The modular 4-qubit quantum circuit of Martina et al. (2022).
The 3-gate structure is repeated 3 times to increase the circuit depth. The
top horizontal lines and blocks represent the device’s interacting qubits and
logical gates. The bottom line represents the device output. In this case,
only 2 qubits are measured, q2 and q3, making each run produce a 2-digit
binary string, e.g. Ym, ˆYm ∈{00, 01, 10, 11}. The first two blue 2-qubit links
represent CNOT gates and the third 3-qubit is a Toffoli gate. See Barenco
et al. (1995) for a formal definition. The red boxes are Hadamard gates, used
to prepare the unobserved qubits into an equal superposition state 1
2(|0⟩+|1⟩).
By convention, the initial state of all qubits is |0⟩. The grey vertical lines
represent 4-qubit synchronization.

Assume we have a set of N classically tractable circuits and run them on
a given QC machine. Let n = 1, . . . , N index these N circuits and m =
1, . . . Mshots the i.i.d. measurements from each circuit, i.e. the execution out-
puts, and Ynm and ˆYnm the m-th noiseless and noisy measurements obtained
from the n-th circuit. As the dimensionality of a circuit’s output depends
on the number of measurements, we do not require Ynm and Yn′m, to have
the same dimensionality.
For example, we may have Ynm ∈{0, 1}sn and
Yn′m ∈{0, 1}sn′ with dn ̸= dn′. Naturally, we require different runs from
the same circuit to have the same dimensionality, i.e. Ynm ∈{0, 1}sn for all
m = 1, . . . Mshots).
Let N + 1 index a test circuit that we can only run on the noisy device
and ˆP ˆYN+1 the corresponding output distribution. The prediction interval
