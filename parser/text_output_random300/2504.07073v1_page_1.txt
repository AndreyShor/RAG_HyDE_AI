ABSTRACT
Context. The winds of massive stars remove a significant fraction of their mass, strongly impacting their evolution. As a star evolves,
the rate at which it loses mass changes. In stellar evolution codes, different mass-loss recipes are employed for different evolutionary
stages. The choice of the recipes is user-dependent and the conditions for switching between them are poorly defined.
Aims. Focusing on hot stars, we aim to produce a physically motivated, empirically calibrated mass-loss recipe suitable for a wide
range of metallicities. We want to provide a ready-to-use universal recipe that eliminates the need for switching between recipes for
hot stars during stellar evolution calculations.
Methods. We compile a sample of hot stars with reliable stellar and wind parameters in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. Our
sample spans effective temperatures from T ≈12 kK – 100 kK and initial masses from Mini ≈15 M⊙– 150 M⊙. The sample is used to
determine the dependence of the mass-loss rate on the basic stellar parameters.
Results. We find that independent of evolutionary stage and temperature, the wind mass-loss rate is a function of the electron-
scattering Eddington parameter (Γe) and metallicity (Z), being in line with expectations of radiation-driven wind theory. Our derived
scaling relation provides an adequate (∆log( ˙M/( M⊙yr−1)) = 0.43) and broadly applicable mass-loss recipe for hot stars.
Conclusions. The newly derived mass-loss recipe covers nearly the entire parameter space of hot stars with UV radiation-driven
winds and eliminates the need for interpolation between mass-loss formulae at different evolutionary stages when applied in stellar
evolution models. Examples of stellar evolution calculations using our new recipe reveal that the predictions on the ionizing fluxes
and final fates of massive stars, especially at low metallicity, differ significantly from models that use the standard mass-loss rates,
impacting our understanding of stellar populations at low metallicity and in the young Universe.

1. Introduction
Massive stars are the mighty engines of the Universe. They shape
their surroundings through intense ionizing radiation and pow-
erful stellar outflows, making them regulators of star formation
and contributors to the chemical enrichment of galaxies (e.g.,
Maeder 1983; Dray et al. 2003; Hopkins et al. 2014; Ramachan-
dran et al. 2018b; Crowther 2019). Despite their significance, un-
derstanding the evolutionary pathways of massive stars remains
challenging due to uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates, inter-
nal mixing processes, and stellar winds. While a star’s initial
mass is the primary factor determining its evolution, the effects
of mass loss on the evolution – particularly for the more mas-
sive (Mini > 30 M⊙) stars – cannot be neglected as stellar winds
can remove significant portions of the hydrogen-rich envelope,
altering the star’s evolutionary path and its final fate (e.g., Conti
1976; Maeder 1987; Langer 1987).
The theoretical foundation for understanding UV-radiation-
driven stellar winds was established in the late 20th century (e.g.,
Mihalas et al. 1972, 1976; Castor et al. 1975; Abbott 1982; Paul-
drach et al. 1986). Over the past decades, significant advance-
ments, both theoretical and empirical, have improved our un-
derstanding of the mass lost through stellar winds (e.g., Vink
et al. 2001; Mokiem et al. 2007; Krtiˇcka & Kubát 2018; Sander
et al. 2020; Rickard et al. 2022; Björklund et al. 2023). How-
ever, these studies often focus on specific groups of stars, such
as main-sequence stars, supergiants, or Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars,
and sometimes only address a narrow range of metallicities. In
stellar evolution models, this segmented approach is reflected in
the use of different mass-loss prescriptions for distinct evolution-
ary phases, resulting in abrupt transitions or simplistic interpola-
tions between these phases (e.g., Brott et al. 2011; Ekström et al.
2012; Choi et al. 2016; Limongi & Chieffi 2018).
When aiming to create synthetic stellar populations, the seg-
mented approach of combining different mass-loss recipes intro-
duces considerable uncertainty as several widely used mass-loss
prescriptions overestimate mass-loss rates by at least an order of
magnitude, particularly for low-metallicity stars (e.g., Oskinova
et al. 2007; Kobulnicky et al. 2019; Shenar et al. 2020). This
discrepancy leads to population synthesis models overpredicting
intermediate-mass helium (He) and WR stars at low metallici-
ties. Such inaccuracies have profound implications for our in-
terpretation of spectra from distant, low-metallicity galaxies ob-
served by the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes (Curtis-
Lake et al. 2023; Bunker et al. 2023), as well as on our un-
derstanding of massive star feedback in galaxies. Furthermore,
