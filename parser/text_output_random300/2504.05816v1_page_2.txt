The subject of our study are the Euler–Lagrange equations for (1.1), which
can be written as
0 = iψt + ψxx + λψ,
λ = Im ψ†ψt + ψ†
xψx.
(1.3)
The key point of this work is to demonstrate that equations (1.3) can be
‘embedded’ into the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy (ALH). In section 2 we show
how one can obtain solutions for (1.3) from solutions for the equations of the
ALH. Such approach was used in, say, [8, 9, 10] and was shown to be rather
useful when one wants to find some particular solutions because the ALH is
one of the most well-studied integrable systems. In section 3 we derive the
N-soliton solutions for our problem by modification of the already known
solitons of the ALH.

ALH hierarchy.
The ALH was introduced in 1976 in [11] as an infinite number of differential
equations, the most famous of which is the discrete nonlinear Schr´odinger
equation.
Later, it has been reformulated as a system of a few functional equations
generated by the Miwa shifts applied to the functions of an infinite number
of arguments (see [12]). The Miwa shifts, denoted by Eξ, are defined as
Eξq(z) = q(z + i[ξ])
(2.1)
where
q(z) = q(z1, z2, ...) = q(zk)k=1,...,∞
(2.2)
and
q(z + i[ξ]) = q(z1 + iξ, z2 + iξ2/2, ...) = q(zk + iξk/k)k=1,...,∞.
(2.3)
In these terms, the ALH can be formulated as the following set of equations:
0 = τnEξτn −τn−1Eξτn+1 −ρnEξσn,
0 = τnEξσn −σnEξτn −ξτn−1Eξσn+1,
0 = ρnEξτn −τnEξρn −ξρn−1Eξτn.
n ∈(−∞, ..., ∞) .
(2.4)
Strictly speaking, the above equations constitute only a half of the hierar-
chy, which is known to consist of two similar sub-hierarchies (the so-called
‘positive’ and ‘negative’ flows). However, for our current purposes, we may
restrict ourselves to (2.4).
