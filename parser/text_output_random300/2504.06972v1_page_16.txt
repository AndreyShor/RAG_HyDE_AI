𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏 are mainly determined by measuring quantum oscillations under large B (Extended 
Data Fig. 2), and double checked by measuring the thickness of h-BN layers. We 
convert n to moiré filling factor ν using the density difference between a series of 
correlated and/or topological quantum states with prominent ρxx and ρxy features. 
 
Band structure calculations 
As described in Ref. 74, we begin by constructing a neural network force field model 
to accurately relax the structure of twisted MoTe2. Next, we compute the band structure 
using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). To ensure precise agreement 
with the bands calculated by density functional theory (DFT) methods, we extend the 
continuum model by including the second harmonics terms for both inter-layer and 
intra-layer coupling. With fitting method, we arrive the parameter: 
m* = 0.62m0, V1 = 10.3 meV, V2 = 2.9 meV, w1 = -7.8 meV, w2= 6.9 meV, 𝜑𝜑 =-75° 
Here, m* represents the effective mass of MoTe2, m0 is the mass of free electron, V1 
and V2 denote the strengths of the first and second harmonic terms of the intra-layer 
potential, 𝜑𝜑 is the phase of the first harmonic term of V1, and w1, w2 correspond to the 
strengths of the first and second harmonic terms of the inter-layer tunneling. This 
refined model effectively reproduces all DFT bands within a twist angle range of 3° to 
5°. Finally, we diagonalize the continuum model Hamiltonian and compute the density 
of states (DOS) using the following formula: 
𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷(𝐸𝐸) =
1
c√2πΩ
෍ 
nk
 𝑒𝑒−(𝐸𝐸nk−𝐸𝐸)2
2c2
 
where Enk represents the energy spectrum, Ω  is the area of the moiré unit cell and c 
(set to be 1 meV here) is the broadening parameter that controls the width of the 
Gaussian broadening applied to the DOS.
