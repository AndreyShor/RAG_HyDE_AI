Deﬁnition 10. The maximum winning probability for a classical strategy for
a non-local game G = (X × Y, A × B, π, V ) is
ωC(G) = max
a,b
X
x,y
π(x, y)V (a(x), b(y), x, y)
where the maximum is taken over all functions a : X →A and b : Y →B.
If we allow Alice and Bob to share entanglement, their winning proba-
bility may beneﬁt from it. A quantum strategy is determined by a bipartite
state |ψ⟩shared between Alice and Bob.
They both perform some mea-
surement according to their respective input and output the result of that
measurement.
precisely, a quantum strategy consists of:
• a state |ψ⟩∈A ⊗B for A and B isomorphic copies of the vector space
Cn for some n. Where A represents Alice’s part of |ψ⟩and B Bob’s
part;
• two sets of positive semideﬁnite n × n matrices
{Xa
x|x ∈X, a ∈A} and {Y b
y |y ∈Y, b ∈B}
satisfying
X
a∈A
Xa
x = I and
X
b∈B
yb
y = I
for every x ∈X and y ∈Y , where I is the n × n identity matrix.
We deﬁne the maximum winning probability of players with quantum
strategies the following way.
