Our previous analysis for infinitely long wires showed
that our system can enter a SOTI phase with a fully
gapped bulk, fully gapped xy and xz surfaces, and two
gapless chiral hinge states propagating along the x direc-
tion. In the case of finite wires, one should additionally
ask whether the yz surfaces of the finite 3D sample are
gapped or not. For this, we calculate the projections of
the competing tunneling terms along the z direction, tz1
and ˜tz¯1, onto the gapless QAH edge states propagating
along the y axis of the 2D layers. The wave functions of
these edge states can be straightforwardly found in mo-
mentum space.
Let us assume for a moment that the
system is periodic in the y direction so that we can work
with the Fourier transform characterized by the momen-
tum ky:
Ψnkyτνσ(x) =
1
p
Ny

m
e−imkyayΨnmτνσ(x).
(18)
As usual, the operator Ψnkyτνσ(x) can be represented
in terms of slowly varying right- and left-moving fields
Rnkyτνσ(x) and Lnkyτνσ(x), defined close to the Fermi
points ±kF , via
Ψnkyτνσ = eikF xRnkyτνσ + e−ikF xLnkyτνσ.

The Hamiltonian of the reduced system, given by H =
H0 + H(1)
B
+ H(1)
y , is diagonal in momentum space,
such that H
=
P
ky Hky.
We start by calculat-
ing the edge state wave functions at ky
=
0 and
E = 0.
We define the Hamiltonian density Hnτ as
Hky=0 = P
n,τ
R
dx Φ†
nτ(x)HnτΦnτ(x), where we choose
the basis Φnτ
=
(Rnkyτ11, Lnkyτ11, Rnkyτ1¯1, Lnkyτ1¯1,
Rnkyτ¯11, Lnkyτ¯11, Rnkyτ¯1¯1, Lnkyτ¯1¯1)T with ky = 0. The
Hamiltonian density becomes
Hnτ = vF ˆkλ3 + ∆B[τσ1λ1 −ν3σ2λ2]/2 + tyτν1λ1, (20)
where the momentum operator ˆk = −i∂x is determined
near the Fermi points, and the Pauli matrices λi, σi, and
νi for i ∈{1, 2, 3} act on right-/left-mover, spin, and
sublattice space ν ∈{1, ¯1}, respectively. We then impose
vanishing boundary conditions at the left and right ends
of each wire. For example, at the left end of the wires
x = 0, the wave function of the gapless edge states is set
to zero: ψnτ(x = 0) = 0, where ψnτ(x) is written in the
basis (Ψnkyτ11, Ψnkyτ1¯1, Ψnkyτ¯11, Ψnkyτ¯1¯1)T with E = 0
and ky = 0. This yields
ψnτ(x) =

where N = 2(ξ1 + ξ2) is a normalization factor, and ξ1 =
vF /ty, ξ2 = vF /(∆B −ty) are localization lengths.
We now calculate the projections of the tunneling
processes along the z direction [see Eqs. (6) and (7)]
onto the gapless states described by the wave functions
ψnτ(x). Taking into account only the dominant terms
with amplitudes t(1)
z1 (x) = 2tz1 cos(2kF x) and ˜t(1)
z¯1 (x) =
2˜tz¯1 cos(2kF x), we obtain

We thus find that if tz1 = ˜tz¯1, the gaps induced by these
competing terms are equal such that the yz surfaces re-
main gapless. Otherwise, if the tunneling amplitudes dif-
fer, the yz surfaces are fully gapped, and only gapless
hinge states remain. The path of these hinge states de-
pends on the dimerization patterns according to which
the yz surfaces are gapped out: When the intercell cou-
pling is dominant, tz1 > ˜tz¯1, the yz surfaces are gapped
out in a nontrivial way, resulting in four hinge states
propagating along the y direction and two hinge states
propagating along the z direction, see Fig. 3(a). Con-
versely, when the intracell coupling dominates, tz1 < ˜tz¯1,
the yz surfaces are gapped out in a trivial way, in which
case no hinge states are propagating along the y direc-
tion as shown in Fig. 3(b).
In addition, we find that
the condition ty ≫tz1, ˜tz¯1 can be relaxed as long as the
2D bulk gap of the individual layers, given by Egap =
min[2(∆B −ty), 2ty] as found in Ref. [26], is not closed
by the tunneling processes along the z axis described by
Eqs. (22) and (23).
Our analytical results can be checked numerically by
exact diagonalization in the tight-binding limit.

FIG. 3.
Sketch of the hinge states in the SOTI phase. Hinge
states propagating to the right (left) with respect to the cor-
responding coordinate axis are shown in blue (orange). The
hinge states follow paths that are determined by the dimeriza-
tion pattern of edge states in the yz plane, pictorially shown
by maroon (nontrivial pattern) and yellow (trivial pattern)
double arrows. The hinge states propagating along the x di-
rection are localized in the plane m = Ny in agreement with
Fig. 2. (a) When tz1 > ˜tz¯1, the yz surfaces are gapped out
nontrivially, resulting in four hinge states propagating along
the y axis and two hinge states propagating along the z axis.
(b) When tz1 < ˜tz¯1, the yz surfaces are gapped out trivially,
in which case no hinge states are propagating along the y di-
rection.
