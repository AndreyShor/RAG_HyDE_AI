Figure 4: Zonal mean and spatial bias analysis of key climate variables. The top row (panels a–c) displays the zonal
mean values for (a) precipitation rate (PRECT, mm/day), (b) near-surface air temperature (TREFHT, K), and (c) zonal
wind component (U, m/s), comparing simulations from CAMulator (teal) and CAM6 (purple). Reanalysis products
(GPCP [1981-2010] and ERA5 [1979-2010]) are shown shown in grey dash. The bottom row (panels d–f) presents
the corresponding spatial biases (CAMulator - CAM) for (d) PRECT, (e) TREFHT, and (f) U, highlighting regional
differences. Biases are computed as the annual mean differences between the two simulations and are visualized using

the general structure of the CAM6 patterns and remain within the expected range of variability over a 30-year simulation
Simpson et al. [2020]. Notably, geopotential height is not directly predicted by CAMulator; rather, it is reconstructed by
summing thicknesses across half-model levels to account for temperature and moisture variations between grid cells.
The fact that CAMulator successfully reproduces the spatial structure of Z500 anomalies suggests that the physical
coherence between surface pressure (PS), temperature (T), and total moisture (Qtot) has been well preserved, lending
credibility to the model’s internal consistency.

ENSO Precipitation Response
ENSO is the dominant mode of tropospheric climate variability on interannual timescales, exerting a strong influence
on global precipitation patterns [e.g., Philander, 1983, Dai and Wigley, 2000, Chapman et al., 2021]. To assess how
well CAMulator replicates the ENSO-related precipitation response, we analyze composite precipitation differences (El
Niño minus La Niña) for the eight strongest ENSO events, identified based on absolute Niño3.4 SST anomalies over
DJF and compare the response to CAM6 (Fig. 6a–b).
Both models capture the characteristic precipitation enhancements in the central and eastern Pacific, particularly near
the International Date Line. However, CAMulator exhibits a slightly muted response in this region, a difference that
may be attributable to internal variability. Notably, this muted response is consistent with the slight under representation
of the PNA and NAO modes, suggesting a potential model tendency to underpredict low-frequency variability, which is
notable in another ML-based climate model Cresswell-Clay et al. [2024]. The precipitation derived from ENSO-driven
teleconnections over North America are well captured, with drier conditions over the southern U.S. and wetter conditions
in the Pacific Northwest. Similarly, the Maritime Continent response aligns closely between the models, indicating that
CAMulator effectively represents the large-scale precipitation shifts associated with ENSO. Examining the patterns
in Figure 6 using a cosine latitude weighted Pearson correlation, we see a precipitation pattern correlation of 0.935
between CAM6 and CAMulator. Overall, CAMulator successfully reproduces the spatial patterns of the CAM6 ENSO
precipitation response, showing strong qualitative agreement.

Extremes and Precipitation
Beyond representing mean climate and large-scale modes of variability, a climate model’s ability to simulate extreme
events is a crucial measure of its fidelity. Extremes (e.g. heatwaves, heavy precipitation events, or droughts) shape
ecosystems, infrastructure resilience, and societal vulnerability. These high-impact phenomena arise from nonlinear
interactions between atmospheric and oceanic processes, making their accurate representation a stringent test of a
