work. In this regard, the author is currently developing a supersymmetric ex-
tension of the model, to be reported in a forthcoming publication.
Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I am also deeply grateful to Professor Emeritus Akio Sug-
amoto of Ochanomizu University for his constant warm encouragement and for
oﬀering numerous important insights during this period.
I sincerely appreciate Associate Professor Shiro Komata of the Open Uni-
versity of Japan for reviewing my manuscript and providing valuable comments
on its structure and presentation. I would also like to thank Mr. Noriaki Aibara
for checking the references.
Finally, with deep gratitude and remembrance, I dedicate this paper to the
memory of my late friend, Mr. Wakata, with whom I was supposed to graduate
when I withdrew from the University of Tsukuba’s graduate program twenty
years ago.

Algebraic Aspects of RVPD
In this appendix, we discuss the algebraic aspects of the Restricted Volume-
Preserving Deformation (RVPD).
The RVPD forms an algebra deﬁned by the following relations:
τ(Q1, Q2) ≡∂Q1
∂σ3 Q2 −∂Q2
∂σ3 Q1,
(A.1)
[Q1, Q2] = 0,
(A.2)
∂
∂σ3 τ(Q1, Q2) = 0.
(A.3)
For any arbitrary element A, the following condition holds:
[ ∂
∂σ3 Q1,2, A] = 0.
(A.4)
These algebraic conditions deﬁne the structure of the RVPD, ensuring that the
restricted transformations preserve the necessary composition rules and main-
tain the consistency of the matrix model under the Lorentz covariant framework.
