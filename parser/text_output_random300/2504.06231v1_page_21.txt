Figure 10: Diatomic energy curves for conservative 5-layer Orb-v3 models trained on different versions
of the OMAT24 dataset. The leftmost column uses the full OMAT24 dataset for training without any
filtering. The "low filter" removes all datapoints with energies above 10 eV, maximum atomic force above
50 eV/Å and maximum eigenvalue of the stress matrix above 1.0 eV/Å
3; this removes a total of 0.4% of
the dataset. The "medium filter" applies more aggressive filtering with thresholds of 0.0 eV, 30 eV/Å and
0.3 eV/Å
3, thereby removing 2.8% of the dataset. The final column only uses the AIMD subset of the
OMAT dataset, discarding all "rattled" systems, which account for 45% of the data.
