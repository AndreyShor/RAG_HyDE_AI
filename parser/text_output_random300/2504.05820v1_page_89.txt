Intrinsic Charm, NNLO match (PDF+MHOU)

Figure 3.7: The intrinsic charm PDF and comparison with models. Left: the purely intrinsic (3FNS)
result (blue) with PDF uncertainties only, compared to the 4FNS PDF, that includes both an intrinsic
and radiative component, at Q = mc = 1.51 GeV (orange). The purely intrinsic (3FNS) result obtained
using N3LO matching is also shown (green). Right: the purely intrinsic (3FNS) final result with total
uncertainty (PDF+MHOU), with the PDF uncertainty indicated as a dark shaded band; the predictions
from the original BHPS model [239] and from the more recent meson/baryon cloud model [247] are
also shown for comparison (dotted and dot-dashed curves respectively).
Therefore, our results have NNLO accuracy and we can only use the N3LO contributions to
the O(α3
s) corrections to the heavy quark matching conditions as a way to estimate the size
of the missing higher orders. Indeed, these corrections have a very significant impact on the
perturbatively generated component, see Section 3.1.2. They become large for x <∼0.1, which
coincides with the region dominated by the perturbative component of the charm PDF, and are
relatively small for the valence region where intrinsic charm dominates.
3.2.2. Results: the intrinsic charm PDF
As summarized in Section 3.1, our starting point is the NNPDF4.0 global analysis, which
provides a determination of the sum of the charm and anticharm PDFs, namely c+(x, Q) =
c(x, Q) + ¯c(x, Q), in the 4FNS. This can be viewed as a probability density in x, the fraction
of the proton momentum carried by charm, in the sense that the integral over all values of
0 ≤x ≤1 of xc+(x) is equal to the fraction of the proton momentum carried by charm quarks,
though note that PDFs are generally not necessarily positive-definite. Our initial 4FNS xc+(x, Q)
at the charm mass scale, Q = mc with mc = 1.51 GeV, is displayed in Fig. 3.7 (left). The ensuing
intrinsic charm is determined from it by transforming to the 3FNS using NNLO matching. This
result is also shown in Fig. 3.7 (left). The bands indicate the 68 % confidence level (CL) interval
associated with the PDF uncertainties (PDFU) in each case. Henceforth, we will refer to the
3FNS xc+(x, Q) PDF as the intrinsic charm PDF.
The intrinsic (3FNS) charm PDF displays a characteristic valence-like structure at large-x
peaking at x ≃0.4. While intrinsic charm is found to be small in absolute terms (it contributes
less than 1 % to the proton total momentum), it is significantly different from zero. Note that
the transformation to the 3FNS has little effect on the peak region, because there is almost no
