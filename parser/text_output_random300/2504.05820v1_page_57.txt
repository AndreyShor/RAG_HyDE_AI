Figure 2.5: Comparison of the structure functions F2 (top) and F (c)

(bottom) using FFNS3 and ZM-VFNS
at NNLO accuracy. The top panels show the absolute comparisons while the bottom ones show the ratio
w.r.t. ZM-VFNS.
However, while ZM-VFNS fully resums all (collinear) logarithms log(m2/Q2), FFNSnf is a fixed
order calculation which only collects a finite number of (collinear) logarithms and hence a
finite difference between the two calculations remains. We indeed observe for both structure
functions F2 and F (c)
2
this expected pattern, thus confirming a consistent implementation. Next,
in Fig. 2.6, we compare FFNS3 and FFNS3(0) coefficient functions as a function of Q2. While
we can indeed observe this convergence at large-Q2, we also find a relevant region at mid to
low Q2 where mass effects can grow up to 25%. This latter region can reach up to O(100) times
the heavy quark mass and clearly demonstrates the need for a VFNS to improve the accuracy of
the prediction.
