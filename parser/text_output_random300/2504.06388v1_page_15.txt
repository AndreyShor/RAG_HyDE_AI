Elimination of spurious oscillations on photoemission spectra

where the factor 2 arises from spin independence and ρ(E) is the density of ﬁnal
continuum states with ﬁnal electron momentum perpendicular to the surface k =
√
2E.
The Heaviside function Θ(−Ei−Φ) restricts the initial states to those contained within
the Fermi sphere (reduced to an energy segment in our 1D treatment), where Ei is
the initial bound electron energy.

We
solve
the
one-dimensional
TDSE
corresponding
to
the
problem
of
photoemission perpendicular to Al(111) surface for the jellium model Eq. (21) using
a = 400 a.u., and V0 = EF +Φ = 0.57 corresponding to a Fermi energy EF = 0.414 a.u.
and a work function of the metal surface Φ = 0.156 a.u.. We consider the ionization
of Al(111) due to grazing incidence of a laser pulse of electric ﬁeld amplitude F0 = 0.1
a.u., frequency ω = 1 a.u. and duration equal to τ = 40 a.u.. By solving the TDSE via
a ﬁnite diﬀerence method, we get the corresponding time-evolved wave function at the
end of the laser pulse ψ(z, τ). Then, we project ψ(z, τ) onto the stationary continuous
eigenfunctions of the time-independent part of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (20) and get
the transition coeﬃcients whose modulus squared represent the emission probability
of the electron into the vacuum region with energy E = k2/2 [see Eq. (6)]. In this
case, we solve the TDSE in Eq. (1) with the Hamiltonian of Eq. (20) discretizing
the position with a numerical mesh of width L = 800 a.u. and spacing ∆z = 0.1
a.u.. We compute the time propagation up to the end of the laser pulse τ using a
time step ∆t = 4.05 × 10−4 a.u.. The aforementioned unperturbed Hamiltonian of
Eq. (20) with the jellium potential in Eq. (21) is diagonalized [25], resulting in 136
bound eigenstates, from which 116 are initially occupied below the Fermi level, and 507
continuum eigenstates. Because the jellium potential is even with respect to the center
of the well, eigenstates of the time-independent part of Hz in Eq. (20) are even or odd
[22]. In addition, the corresponding time-evolved wave function for the typical laser
intensities considered is only subtly non-symmetrical. We then projected the time-
evolved wave-function at the end of the pulse, ψ(z, τ), onto the stationary eigenstates
of the numerical box with eigenenergies E > 0 (representing the continuum), which
results in the energy spectrum with huge oscillations spanning about two orders
of magnitude shown with a thin red line of Fig.
