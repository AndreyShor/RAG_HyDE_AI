α are encoded by [C(3)
Hl ]αα. Focusing on this class of new physics interactions, one can compare the
bounds on ratios of effective couplings gα ≡g(1 + [C(3)
Hl ]αα) from a variety of experiments, as shown
in the right panel of Fig. 1. This shows again the competitiveness of PIONEER.
In later Phases (II,III), PIONEER will also study pion beta decay π+ →π0e+ν(γ) ultimately
aiming at an order of magnitude improvement in precision to determine Vud in a theoretically
pristine manner and test CKM unitarity, for which there is presently a 3σ tension [8], see Fig. 2.
Finally, the very large datasets collected by PIONEER will provide a platform to search for
new feebly-coupled particles (such as heavy neutral leptons or axion-like particles). For example,
emission of a heavy neutral lepton (HNL) with mass in the O(10 – 100) MeV range would produce
an anomalous peak in the outgoing positron energy, and even if the HNL is too massive to be
emitted, the associated lepton mixing would generically cause the ratio Re/µ to differ from its SM
value, thereby producing an apparent violation of µ-e lepton flavor universality [9–15].

PIONEER Phase I (uncert. 
(a) PIONEER Phase I goal
(b) Comparison of LFU tests
Figure 1: (a) The figure summarizes the goal of the PIONEER experiment for the measurement of
Re/µ. The current world-average experimental value and its error bar are reported in blue. The
theoretical prediction and its uncertainty are shown in purple. The red band represents the size of
the projected PIONEER uncertainty. (b) Comparison of probes of LFU tests between the first and
second generation. Existing measurements from Kaons, Taus and Pions are taken from Ref. [4] and
from Ref. [16] for W →µ/W →e.
PIONEER is an ambitious program that will span more than a decade of research activity. This
document provides a brief overview of the detector concepts, simulations, estimated sensitivities
and planning for realization. Ref. [2] provides the most comprehensive description of the effort to
date. The figures and values quoted in this section are meant to provide meaningful inputs to the
Physics Preparatory Group, in particular for the working groups 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7. More details are
available upon request.

The PIONEER experiment
The main challenge in developing a next generation experiment for a high precision measurement of
rare pion decays is accurately assessing the performance of the chosen detector technology in sup-
pressing sources of systematic uncertainties and handling increased rates. The PIONEER detector
design concept, described in the next sections, is based on the experience gathered with the PIENU
