FIG. 3. Optical response of the resonator across four modes and four positions. (a) Changes in 1/Q and ∆fr/fr for different
modes and positions under the laser illumination.
The response is categorized into three types based on frequency shifts:
low-frequency shift (red shift), high-frequency shift (blue shift), and subtle shift (purple).
(b) Simulated current density
distribution for resonant modes (Sonnet). The simulated current density distributions correspond to the first, second, third,
and fifth resonance modes (from left to right). The color is normalized by the maximum current density for each mode. Four
corners of the resonator structure are labeled as Area1–4. The corners are enlarged to highlight the current density in each
mode. To avoid current crowding at the corner, the current density is averaged except at the corner.
2(b)) are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). From Fig. 2(d), it is
evident that 1/Q and (fr(Popt)−fr(Popt = 0))/fr(Popt =
0) = ∆fr/fr monotonically increase and decrease, respec-
tively, with optical power, Popt. Optical illumination to
superconductor destructs Cooper pairs, resulting in an
increase in the quasiparticle density, nqp. The increase
in 1/Q, which is due to the rise in the quasiparticle den-
sity (∆(1/Q) ∝nqp [27]), is linear with respect to the
optical power (∆(1/Q) = γPopt) (Fig. 2(d)), suggesting
that the quasiparticle density increases linearly with Popt.
The frequency shift caused by the quasiparticle genera-
tion can be approximated as ∆fr/fr ≃−∆nqp/(2ns) (see
Supplementary Notes) when the quasiparticle density is
sufficiently small compared to the superfluid density, ns,
at low temperatures and for values of Lk much larger
than the geometric inductance, Lg (Lk ≫Lg).
This
means that the resonant frequency shifts linearly to the
low-frequency side with the generation of quasiparticles.
However, the observed nonlinear shifts in ∆fr/fr (Fig.
2(d)) cannot be explained solely by the expected linear
shift originated from the quasiparticle generation propor-
tional to the optical power.
Mode and position dependence of the optical
response
Next, to investigate the dependence on illumination
position and resonance mode, the optical responses of
1/Q and ∆fr/fr are measured for 16 patterns of four res-
onance modes (first, second, third, and fifth) and four lo-
cations (Area1-4) (Fig. 3(a), (b)). The changes in Q and
resonance frequency with optical power show remarkable
differences depending on the illumination positions and
resonance modes.
1/Q increases linearly with optical
power for all modes and positions, with different slopes γ.
Here, γ is defined as 1/Q = γPopt+1/Q0. The optical re-
sponses in ∆fr/fr differ not only in their degree of change
but also in the direction of the shift. Notably, three pat-
terns are observed: low-frequency shift (red shift), high-
frequency shift (blue shift), and no significant change. A
comparison between the blue and red shifts shows that
