measurements, and we determine the PDFs only using DIS structure function data. The valence
charm PDF found in either case is compared to the default in Fig. 3.19. Removing the LHCb
electroweak data leaves xc−mostly unchanged, hence the valence PDF appears to be less
sensitive to this data than the total charm. When only including DIS data a nonzero valence
component is still found but now with a reduced significance: the result is consistent with zero
at the one sigma level.
Kinematic cuts.
The NNPDF4.0 dataset only includes data with Q2 ≥3.5 GeV2 and W 2 ≥
12.5 GeV2, in order to ensure the reliability of the leading-twist, fixed-order perturbative
approximation. It is important to verify that results for intrinsic charm are stable upon variation
of these cuts, as this checks that intrinsic charm is not contaminated by possible non-perturbative
corrections not accounted for in the global PDF fitting framework. To this purpose, we have
raised the W 2 cut in steps of 2.5 GeV2 up to 20 GeV2, and the Q2 cut up to 5 GeV2. Results are
displayed in Fig. 3.20, and prove satisfactory stability: upon variation of the W 2 cut nothing
changes, and upon variation of the Q2 cut (which removes a sizable amount of data) the central
value is stable and the uncertainty only marginally increased.
3.3.2. The intrinsic valence charm PDF
The intrinsic valence charm PDF is now determined by transforming back to the 3FNS scheme,
and is displayed in Fig. 3.21 (upper panel), together with its 4FNS counterpart already shown
in Fig. 3.15. An estimate of the missing higher order uncertainties (MHOU) related to the
truncation of the perturbative expansion is also included. This, as in Section 3.2.2, is estimated
as the change in the 3FNS PDF when the transformation from the 4FNS to the 3FNS is performed
to one higher perturbative order, i.e. N3LO, as this is estimated to be the dominant missing
higher order correction.
