carrier migration, the potential equation for the electro-
static field ϕ0 is given by (Boughdad et al., 2019):
∇2
⊥ϕ0 + ∇⊥ln(1 + ˜I) · ∇⊥ϕ0 = |Eext|∂ln(1 + ˜I)
∂z
, (85)
where ∇⊥represents the gradient in the transverse plane,
and ˜I = I/Isat is the normalized intensity, accounting
for the ratio between thermal and photoinduced excita-
tions. In experimental setups, an incoherent white light
background is typically used to introduce a controlled
contribution to the thermal excitation, effectively mod-
ifying the saturation intensity and the overall nonlinear
response of the system.
In the isotropic approximation, the space-charge field
simplifies to:
Esc = Eext
1 + ˜I
,
(86)
and the nonlinear refractive index variation follows:
∆n(I) = ∆nmax
I
I + Isat
,
(87)
where ∆nmax = 1
2n3
0r33Eext is the maximum refractive
index change. This expression is identical to the one ob-
tained for atomic vapor in the presence of saturation.
This means that once the choice of materials (e.g., SBN,
LiNbO3) has been made the only parameter controlling
the nonlinear response is the external electric field Eext
which enhances charge drift, increasing the nonlinear re-
sponse. This clearly simplifies the parameters space ex-
ploration compared to complex energy levels in atomic
vapors but also limits the tunability.
In practice, the refractive index modification photo-
induced in a biased nonlinear photorefractive crystal
can be accurately controlled by means of a background
incoherent illumination and an external electric field.
One method to quantify this effect relies on measuring
the diffraction patterns of the laser beam propagating
through the medium and undergoing spatial self-phase
modulation as shown in Fig.
8 (left).
It has been
shown in (Boughdad et al., 2019), that the response is
anisotropic in the stationary regime leading to asymmet-
ric diffraction patterns as shown in Fig. 8 (right).
Finally, an important tool for investigating quantum
fluids of light is the ability to imprint and manipulate
external potentials within nonlinear optical media.
In
photorefractive crystal, one effective approach involves
optical induction, where an externally applied potential
is created semi-permanently using an extra laser beam.
The refractive index modulation induced by the optical
induction persists due to the photorefractive screening
nonlinearity, which stabilizes the imprinted potential un-
der an applied electric field. This allows for creating a
lattice potential for the light (Fleischer et al., 2003) or a
localized potential such as a defect or a barrier (Michel
et al., 2018) as proposed initially by (Hakim, 1997).
C. Thermo-optic media
Thermo-optic media exhibit a refractive index that de-
pends on local temperature variations caused by the ab-
sorption of laser light. When a beam propagates through
such a medium, part of its energy is absorbed, creating
local heating. This heating modifies the refractive index
profile, resulting in nonlinear optical effects. The induced
refractive index change is expressed as:
∆n = β∆T,
(88)
where β = ∂n
∂T is the thermo-optic coefficient, character-
istic of the material, and ∆T is the induced temperature
variation.
Under conditions of low absorption, heat transport
predominantly occurs in the transverse plane (x, y), while
the axial direction z can be neglected due to the rela-
tively small temperature gradients along the propagation
direction (∇⊥T ≫∇zT). In the steady-state approxi-
mation, the temperature distribution is governed by the
two-dimensional heat diffusion equation:
∇2
⊥∆T = −α
κ I(r⊥),
(89)
where α is the linear absorption coefficient, κ is the ther-
mal conductivity, and I(r⊥) is the optical intensity dis-
tribution in the transverse plane.
Given ∆n = β∆T, the heat diffusion equation trans-
forms into a two-dimensional Poisson equation for the
refractive index variation:
∇2
⊥∆n = −αβ
κ I(r⊥).
(90)
This equation can be solved using Green’s function meth-
ods, yielding the formal solution (Vocke, 2017):
∆n(r⊥) = γ
Z
d2r′
⊥R(r⊥−r′
⊥)I(r′
⊥),
(91)
where R(r) is the non-local response function related to
the Green’s function of the heat diffusion problem and
γ is a constant that links the two quantities. Physically,
the function R(r) represents how heat generated at one
location spreads out spatially, smoothing intensity varia-
tions and producing a refractive index profile extending
beyond the immediate area of absorption.
To calculate the constant γ, a physical model should be
defined for the system boundaries. In a system with infi-
nite boundaries, an exact solution for R(r) is logarithmic
and thus physically unrealistic since real thermal diffu-
sion always occurs within finite dimensions (Vocke, 2017).
Therefore, practical scenarios involve finite boundaries
and typically result in exponentially decaying spatial pro-
files R(r) ∝e−r/σT as in (Bar-Ad et al., 2013) or Gaus-
sian profiles R(r) ∝e−r2/σ2
T as in (Briedis et al., 2005),
with σT defining the characteristic non-local length scale
as shown in Fig. 9(a).
