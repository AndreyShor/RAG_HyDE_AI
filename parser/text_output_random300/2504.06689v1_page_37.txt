main theoretical uncertainties originate from missing higher-order corrections . The authors
emphasize the need to include corrections in the top quark decay, which impact results at the
10% level. The same authors did a similar study on the 3-lepton channel [980].
In Ref. [981], threshold resummation for t¯tt¯t have been performed NLL’ accuracy. The
calculation is matched to the NLOQCD and NLOEW corrections. The NLL’ corrections are posi-
tive at the level of 15% for the total production rate and reduce the size of the scale variation by
a factor of 2, which brings the theoretical error well below the current experimental uncertainty.

The tensions observed in t¯tW measurements for several years [999, 1000] have triggered
several theory studies.
For example, in Ref. [221], the first NNLOQCD corrections for t¯tW
have been computed.
The computation is exact apart from the finite part of the two-loop
virtual amplitude, which is estimated through a soft-W approximation and a massification
procedure.
The NNLOQCD corrections increase the cross section by 15%, and significantly
reduce the perturbative uncertainty. Nevertheless, the authors have found that the tensions
with ATLAS and CMS measurements remain at the level of 1−2 sigma. Along the same line, it
has been speculated that these tensions could be alleviated by including also t¯tWj predictions in
the theory predictions. In Ref. [1001], NLOQCD corrections to this process have been calculated,
considering off-shell top quarks, and the W boson in the NWA.
Full NLOSM predictions for t¯tZ for off-shell top quarks have been computed [327]. The
authors highlight that, although a calculation with on-shell top quarks captures the majority
of the effects across phase space (in particular the non-trivial hierarchy between the various
orders in perturbation theory), fully off-shell calculations are vital, especially when considering
stringent experimental cuts.
Full NLOSM corrections have been calculated for t¯tγ where the top quarks have been
described in the NWA [1002] and with full off-shell effects [1003]. The residual perturbative
uncertainty is between 5% −8%.
