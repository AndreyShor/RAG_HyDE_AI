In contrast to locally interacting quantum spin models, the spatial dimension of this model does not influence
the behaviour. This follows from the fact that for the averages
SΛN

|ΛN|

σi(x),
(i = 1, 2, 3),
(3.3)
we can write the Hamiltonian (3.1) (see e.g. [30]) as
HCW
ΛN = −|ΛN|
Γ

(3.5)
with B3 = {(x, y, z) | x2 + y2 + z2 ≤1} the unit three-dimensional sphere in R3.
Using spherical coordinates e(Ω) = (sin ϑ cos φ, sin ϑ sin φ, cos ϑ), with ϑ ∈[0, π] and φ ∈[0, 2π); for radius
u ∈[0, 1], we may now rewrite
hCW

(u · e(Ω)) = −
Γ
2 (u cos ϑ)2 + Bu sin ϑ cos φ

(3.6)
as being a polynomial function on [0, 1] × S2.
As a result, we may as well consider the quantum Curie–Weiss Hamiltonian (3.1) in ℓ= 1, so that we may
simply write |ΛN| = N and HCW
N
:= HCW
ΛN .

The CW model as GLT-sequence
Here we show that the real symmetric matrix-sequence { ¯HCW
N
}N, dN = 2N, where ¯HCW
N
:= HCW
N
/N, is a
basic GLT matrix-sequence with GLT symbol 0, i.e., a zero-distributed matrix-sequence (Axiom GLT 2.,
third item).
Theorem 2. The normalized CW Hamiltonian ¯HCW
N
:= HCW
N
/N defines { ¯HCW
N
}N as a zero-distributed
GLT sequence.
Proof. The Curie-Weiss Hamiltonian is self-adjoint and in fact all the considered matrices are real symmetric.
Thus in view of Definition 1 (with dN = 2N, D = [0, 1] × S2), it suffices to prove that for all real-valued
F ∈Cc(R)
lim
N→∞

2N Tr2N [F( ¯HCW
N
)] = F(0),
