These canonical equations ensure the conservation of the Hamiltonian and the to-
tal momentum p1 + p2. They can also be shown [105] to be equivalent to the geodesic
equations (55) and (56), which become

under the coordinate conditions (21) [105].
5.2. Test Particle Limit
To make sense of the solutions contained in (77), it is useful to first consider the test
particle limit in which m1 = µ << m = m2 and both particles have zero charge. Setting the
latter to be a static source at the origin, with z2 = 0 = p2, the defining Equation (77) becomes
