time, and model complexity.
This study reflects the need for tailored deep learning
models, where architecture selection is guided by the unique dynamics of the system
under consideration.
On the other hand, ROMs have surfaced as a promising approach to achieving both
efficiency and accuracy for cleaning and data extraction from CFD simulations, experi-
mental, and real-world datasets. ROMs significantly reduce the computational cost by
projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace, capturing the most
essential features of the system [14]. Several studies have demonstrated the successful
application of ROMs in fluid dynamics. Rowley and Dawson [15] provided a comprehens-
ive review of model reduction techniques, including Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
(POD) [16], Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) [17], and other methods for flow ana-
lysis and control, showcasing the efficiency of POD and DMD in reducing computational
costs. Schmid [16] and Kutz et al. [18] explored the utility of dynamic mode decom-
position to capture the dynamics of complex systems with experimental and numerical
data, demonstrating its role in improving traditional ROMs. Similarly, Taira et al. [19]
elucidated the merits of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [20] and DMD in fluid
dynamics, emphasizing its ability to capture essential fluid characteristics with minimal
computational effort. SVD serves as one of the primary techniques for calculating POD
modes, as highlighted by Le Clainche [21]. By decomposing the flow field into orthogonal
spatial modes and their corresponding temporal coefficients, SVD enables efficient dimen-
sionality reduction while preserving the most significant features of the flow dynamics.
This dual capability makes SVD a cornerstone of reduced-order modeling in fluid dynam-
ics, offering both computational efficiency and physical interpretability. Begiashvili et al.
[22] provides a comprehensive review of the most widely used modal decomposition tech-
niques, including DMD, SVD, spectral POD [23], higher-order DMD [24], and resolvent
analysis [25], emphasizing their strengths and limitations in fluid dynamics applications.
The study highlights how each method performs in developing ROMs and extracting dom-
inant patterns from complex flow fields, offering critical insights into their suitability for
various fluid dynamic problems. Both POD and DMD are powerful and complementary
techniques for identifying flow structures in fluid dynamics. POD modes are orthogonal
in space, meaning that each POD mode captures multiple frequencies. Conversely, DMD
modes are orthogonal in time, with each mode associated with a single frequency, making
DMD particularly well-suited for identifying flow instabilities. In linear flows, the DMD
modes correspond to the linear stability modes, while in periodic flows, they represent
Fourier modes. In saturated flows, the DMD modes capture groups of flow structures
that effectively model the flow dynamics [26]. This distinction allows POD to excel in
capturing dominant spatial structures and DMD to provide detailed temporal dynamics.
The fusion of ROMs with deep learning architectures has attracted a lot of attention
in recent times. These models, termed hybrid ROMs, can capture the underlying phys-
ics while using deep learning architectures to construct highly robust predictive models
