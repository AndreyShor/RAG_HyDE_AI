where µ is the reduced mass of the system.
The projectile energy in lab frame, Elab, would be related to centre-of-mass energy Ecm using standard relation
Ecm =
mT
mT + mP
Eℓab.

Here, mT and mP are masses of target and projectile respectively.
The central idea of the Variable Phase Approach (VPA) is to obtain the phase shift δ directly from physical
quantities, such as the interaction potential, without solving the Time-Independent Schr¨odinger Equation (TISE)
for wave functions u(r), which are typically used to determine δℓ(k, r). The PFM was originally developed for
the case of scattering by a spherically symmetric potential, but it was later expanded to include more generic
conditions such as scattering in the field of many channels, relativistic equations, non-central forces, single channel,
multi-channel and so forth.
2.2.1
Single Channel scattering:
For elastic scattering of different channels by a central potential where different orbital angular momenta remain
independent, the second-order Time Independent Schrodinger Equation (TISE) is transformed into a Riccati-type
equation given by[19]
dδℓ(k, r)
dr
= −U(r)
k

cos(δℓ(k, r))ˆjℓ(kr) −sin(δℓ(k, r))ˆηℓ(kr)
2
(6)
where U(r) = 2µV (r)
ℏ2
and δℓ(k, r) is called as phase function. The initial condition for the phase equation is δℓ(0) = 0,
which corresponds to the actual absence of potential at r = 0. Here ˆjℓ(k, r) and ˆnℓ(k, r) are the Riccati-Bessel and
Riccati-Neumann functions[25].
The phase shift δℓ(k, r) can be seen as a real function of k and characterizes the strength of scattering of any
partial wave that is say ℓth partial wave of the potential U(r). The riccati-Hankel function of the first kind relates
to the Riccati-Bessel Function ˆjℓ(k, r) and the Riccati-Neumann function ˆnℓ(k, r) as ˆhℓ(r) = −ˆηℓ(r) + i ˆjℓ(r). The
Riccati-Bessel and Riccati-Neumann functions can be derived using the recurrence relations.
ˆjℓ+1(kr) = 2ℓ+ 1
kr
ˆjℓ(kr) −ˆjℓ−1(kr)
(7)
ˆηℓ+1(kr) = 2ℓ+ 1
kr
ˆηℓ(kr) −ˆηℓ−1(kr)
(8)
So phase equation, for ℓ=0 is:
δ′
0(k, r) = −U(r)
k
sin2[kr + δ0(r)]
(9)
for ℓ=1 is
δ′
1(k, r) = −U(r)
k
sin(δ1 + (kr)) −(kr) cos(δ1 + (kr))
(kr)
2
