The Stokes V profile provides information about the 
photospheric line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field 
component and represents the circular polarization of 
spectra caused by the Zeeman effect in magnetically 
sensitive 
lines. 
Using 
inversion 
or 
calibration 
techniques, 
LOS magnetograms—such as 
those 
generated by Hinode/SP or SDO/HMI [9,10]—are derived 
from raw Stokes V data. Therefore, examining the 
locations of detected anomalous Stokes V profiles on 
magnetograms s crucial to deduce the potential triggers 
of flares, driven by the buildup of magnetic energy. 
Figure 3 illustrates spectral profiles that resulted in 
the highest reconstruction errors. Panels (a) to (c) 
display the pre-flare SP maps, while panel (d) 
corresponds to the during-flare SP map, with the time 
leading up to the start of the X1.3 flare indicated 
alongside their respective datetimes. Each panel 
Figure 2. Sample reconstructed profiles for different 
positions within AR 13663, including quiet Sun (red), 
pore (yellow), penumbra (magenta), and umbra (green). 
The top plots display the pixel positions on continuum 
image (left) and their reconstruction error values for 
Stokes V (right). The top-right plot also shows the 
Stokes V observational error ( 𝜎𝑜𝑏𝑠,𝑉) and mean 
reconstruction error (𝜇𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸𝑉) levels. The bottom plot 
depicts the Stokes V profiles and their reconstructions 
for each selected pixel position. 
Figure 3. Error heatmaps and detected anomalous 
spectral profiles. In each panel from (a) to (d), the left 
side shows an error heatmap and a magnetogram with 
the error heatmap overlaid, and the h-RMSEV pixel 
position marked by a red cross. The Stokes profiles and 
their reconstructions for the h-RMSEV pixel are 
presented on the right.
