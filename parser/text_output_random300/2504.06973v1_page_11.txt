Fig. 9: Spectral constraints on the temperature and surface gravity of the Be companion star. The panels show a comparison between
the disentangled Be star spectrum (black) with models of different Teff - log g combinations (see the legend for the respective Teff
and log g values). The blue dashed line represents our fiducial model. The shape of the Balmer line wings favours a surface gravity
of log g of 3.5 - 4.0, as would be expected for a star that is slightly inflated due to recent mass transfer.
7. Photometric analysis
7.1. SED fit
To estimate the stellar radii, we fitted the SED of the system. We
queried archival photometric data for HIP 15429 using the VO
Sed Analyzer (VOSA; Bayo et al. 2008). We found near-infrared
(NIR) photometry that includes J-, H-, and Ks-band data from
the 2MASS all-sky catalogue (Cutri et al. 2003), and far-infrared
(FIR) photometry that covers the W1, W2, W3, and W4 bands
from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright
et al. 2010). Optical photometry was obtained from Gaia DR3 in
the G, G_RP, and G_BP filters, together with synthetic photom-
etry in the Sloan u, g, r, and i filters derived from Gaia BP/RP
mean spectra (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2023b). Additionally,
we acquired near-ultraviolet (NUV) photometry with the Swift
Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT; Roming et al. 2005). On
2 March 2023, we obtained a single exposure in the UVM2 filter
band with an exposure time of 505 s and 2x2 binning 3. The raw
data were processed and calibrated with the standard pipeline at
the Swift Data Center (version 3.19.01). We measured flux den-
sities and uncertainties via manually placed apertures using the
uvotsource routine as part of the HEASOFT software pack-
age (Nasa High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research
Center (Heasarc) 2014). Table A.2 lists all flux measurements
and filter bands.
For the narrow-lined star, we used the grid of PoWR stellar
atmosphere models, while for the Be companion star, we used
the Tlusty spectra (see the beginning of Sect. 6 and Appendix C
for model specifications). We adopted the extinction law of Fitz-
patrick (1999) and performed two-dimensional linear interpola-
tion between model SEDs, with synthetic photometry computed
using pyphot (Fouesneau 2024).
We used a nested sampling framework to infer the posterior
PDFs for the stellar radii. The radius of the narrow-lined star,
RB, was assigned a uniform prior of [1, 15] R⊙. Since extinction
affects the SED shape, we also inferred the extinction parame-
ters, assuming uniform priors for E(B −V) ∈[0.5, 1.0] mag and
RV ∈[2.0, 4.0]. The broad-lined Be star’s radius was constrained
through the flux ratio and the inferred RB. The stellar parame-
ters (Teff, log g, and the flux ratio) were determined from spec-
tral analysis; rather than independently re-determining them, we
adopted normal priors based on their measured values and un-
certainties (see Table 1), allowing them to vary only to propa-

Fig. 10: Comparison of model SEDs with observed photometry
of HIP 15429. Black stars indicate photometric measurements
(see Table A.2), grey circles show synthetic photometry gener-
ated from the model SED in the same filters. Only data points
leftwards of the grey dotted line were used in the fitting process.
As a grey line, the model fit of the SED is plotted which is the
sum of contributions from the narrow-lined stripped star (blue)
and Be star companion (red). For the stellar components, exam-
ple draws from the posterior are shown as thin lines, the me-
dian values as the thicker, dashed curves. The inset axis shows
a zoom-in on the optical wavelength regime with the Gaia XP
spectrum overplotted in green. An infrared excess is visible on
the right-hand side of the plot.
gate their uncertainties to the radius estimates. For distance, we
assumed a normal prior centred on the Gaia DR3 estimate of
(1693 ± 89) pc, with the standard deviation set to three times the
Gaia uncertainty. This accounts for the typical underestimation
of parallax (and hence distance) uncertainties by up to a factor
of 2 for bright sources and those with RUWE > 1.4 (El-Badry
et al. 2021; Nagarajan & El-Badry 2024). Our analysis indicates
an infrared excess, likely originating from the companion star’s
circumstellar disk. Therefore, we restricted the SED fit to the
optical and UV wavelength bands, excluding WISE and 2MASS
photometry.
