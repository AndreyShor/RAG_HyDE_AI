(a) An ideal triangular lattice that serves as the reference for
calculation of non-affinity χ.
(b) A representative configu-
ration at ˜Dt = 1.0 and Λ = 8.0, is shown color coded by
local non-affine parameter χ; see the color bar. (c) A single
coarse-graining region Ω, which includes one central particle
with reference position R0 (cyan) and actual location r0 (dark
green). The reference (cyan, {Ri}) and actual locations (dark
green, {ri}) of its six nearest neighbors are shown as well.
non-linearly with density [77], predicting an associated
decrease in ⟨χ⟩.
At melting, the non-affine parameter
is expected to diverge as the shear modulus G vanishes.
Thus, the expression can be generalized to ⟨χ⟩eq ∼Dt
G ,
with G increasing with density ρ and vanishing at the
melting point. Ignoring non-linearities for simplicity, the
following emerges:
G(ρ) = a(ρ −ρm)
for
ρ > ρm,
= 0
otherwise,

with ρm representing the melting density.
In this paper, we first consider the impact of activity
on a solid maintained at a fixed temperature and density.
As activity increases, the persistence length ℓp = v0/Dr
dominates system’s behavior. The effective diffusivity of
ABPs in two dimensions is Deff = Dt + v2
0/2Dr [78, 79],
which includes the contribution from activity. The non-
affine parameter is expected to increase with activity as
⟨χ⟩∼Deff/G which in dimensionless form is:
⟨χ⟩= G−1( ˜Dt + Λ2/2).

In active systems, the melting point ρm depends on
Λ [15], affecting the density dependence of G in Eq.(5).

unfilled markers represent the thermal system ( ˜Dt = 1.0).
Data are fitted to aρ Λν with best-fit exponents ν = 2.00±0.01
(athermal) and ν = 2.11 ± 0.06 (thermal).
Inset: density-
dependent prefactor aρ decreases with density as (ρ −ρ0)−1,
with ρ0σ2 = 0.947±0.008 (athermal) and ρ0σ2 = 0.971±0.004
(thermal).
Beyond that, the shear modulus decreases with activity
as
G = G0 −G1Λ2,
(7)
as shown in a later section using numerical simulations.
However, the Λ dependence of G does not modify the
dominant pre-melting scaling ⟨χ⟩∼Λ2 appreciably.
In summary, for densities ρ > ρm and activity Λ < Λc,
the following scaling forms are expected:
⟨χ⟩∼(ρ −ρm)−1
and
⟨χ⟩∼Λ2.

We compare these predictions with numerical simulations
