Notice that the first solution is fixed by the Z3-symmetry. By a conjecture in [13], this signifies that
there are three disjoint Coulomb branches at e−t = −1
27 rather than one, indicating that there are
three massless hypermultiplets of the same charge at this locus. This is consistent with the results
that we obtain in §3.1 on the singular degenerations of the mirror manifold. We further note that
the two loci ±
i
3
√
3 both have the same distance from the two phases and are closer to the strongly
coupled phase.
Due to the relation 1 + α + α2 = 0, we find another solution to the Coulomb branch equations at
1 + z + w = 0, or equivalently, σ1 + σ2 + σ3 = 0:
e−t →∞:
z = α
w = α2,
z = α2
w = α.

This happens in non-regular theories and there is a connection with the Coulomb branch we found
in the strongly-coupled phase. In the context of U(k) GLSMs with a strongly coupled SU(k)-
phase at ζ < 0 a careful analysis in [9] showed that the Coulomb branch in the strongly coupled
phase gets lifted at finite ζ < 0 but not at ζ →−∞. In contrast to the Coulomb branches at the
phase boundary, we cannot associate a specific (mod2π)-theta angle value to this Coulomb branch.
Rather, there is a Coulomb branch for any value of the theta angle9. It is expected that the CFT in
the limit ζ →−∞is singular. This is not a problem for string compactifications. Typical examples
with singular CFTs are conifold points or pseudo-hybrid points [47] which have interesting physics
and mathematics. In physics, this means that there are extra massless states, with implications
for supergravity/black holes [34, 48, 49] and the connectedness of the moduli space of Calabi-Yau
string vacua [50–52]. Mirror symmetry seems to be fine with these structures as well and leads to
sensible results.
Let us give a more detailed analysis of Coulomb branches at infinity and their effects following [9,
§4.4]. The argument generalises to one-parameter GLSMs with maximal torus (U(1)1×. . .×U(1)k)
and an additional Zk-action that cyclically permutes the U(1)s and this should apply to our model.

The X-fields may be components of a fundamental k-plet as in Rødland-type models or they can
be viewed as coordinates of a free quotient by Zk of the toric variety determined by U(1)k.

There is a Coulomb branch whenever ( σi

9When compactifying the moduli space to a punctured sphere, the puncture associated to this Coulomb branch
should lie on the south pole.
