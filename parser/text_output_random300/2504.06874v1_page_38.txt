contrast shows an increased trend with increasing doping. The white boxes in (b) label 
the sample areas of the two nearby regions in adjacent ABAB and ABCB stackings in 
which the optical contrasts are extracted.

white box marks the scanning area of (b). b, SNOM image of the same tetralayer 
graphene shown in (a), which contains four different optical near-field contrasts at Vg 
= 0 V. The yellow dashed frame labels the scanning area of KPFM mapping shown in 
Fig. S16. c, Raman spectra of the four different stackings. Different symbols in (b) mark 
the positions where the Raman spectra in (c) are taken. To better distinguish the spectra 
of different stackings, we manually shift the spectrum of ABCA stacking. The scale bar 
in (b) is 6 Âµm.

Fig. S21. KPFM measurement of device 4 at Vg = 0 V. a, Topography of the tetralayer 
graphene. b, SNOM image of the same area as in (a). Domains with distinct stackings 
are labeled by different symbols in color. At Vg = 0 V, the two polar stackings (indicated 
by triangles) show different near-field optical contrast, since this sample is hole doped 
at Vg = 0 V. The stacking assignments in (b) are also supported by our Raman spectra 
in Fig. S15 and the KPFM result in (c). c, KPFM mapping of the same area as in (a) 
and (b) at Vg = 0 V. For the two nearby (not directly being adjacent) polar stackings, the 
one that is darker (brighter) in SNOM image appears to be brighter (darker) in KPFM, 
indicative of the downward polarization (downward triangle in (b)) and upward 
polarizations (upward triangle in (b)), respectively. The blue dashed line marks the 
boundary between the ABAB domain and the ABCB domain, and the yellow dashed
