For |z| ď t

¯npzq ě 1` L`1

we finally obtain log L`1

The key tool for the proof of Proposition 2.3 is the following renewal representation of
the second moment of the partition function developed in [CSZ19a].
Remark A.1 (Renewal interpretation). Given N P N, we define the integer valued
renewal process

For β “ βN in the quasi-critical regime (1.22), we can then write (2.12) as follows: for every

(A.3)
where KN is an independent Geometric random variable with mean log N
|ϑN| .
Proof of Proposition 2.3. Note that (recall (A.2) and (1.15))

Then it follows by (2.12) and (2.13) that

which yields the RHS of (2.14) as an upper bound.
To get a lower bound, note that we can write P

because
the law of T pNq
