The evolution is determined by a retarded Green’s func-

G(t−t′; r, r′) = δ(t−t′)δ(r−r′),
(4)
under the boundary condition G(t −t′; r, r′) = 0 for
t < t′. The retarded Green function receives three con-
tributions, G = (GF + GQ + GB). At linear order and
for t′ ≥t−|r−r′|, the Green’s function G ≃GF behaves
as in ﬂat background: a wave arrives at (t, r) without
passing through the potential barrier, and thus with-
out being reﬂected or deformed. For t′ ≤t −|r −r′|,
the Green’s function G ≃GQ oscillates with QNM fre-
quencies: a wave generated in this region pass through
the potential and is deformed into a ﬁrst-order QNM.
Finally, the branch-cut part GB describes the backscat-
tering of waves by the long-range part of the poten-
tial barrier and is responsible for the Price’s tail. At
the linear order the contribution of GB is usually small
compared to the other contributions [15], and one may
neglect it. In the Supplementary Material we oﬀer a
self-similar and quantum mechanical derivation of the
linear Price’s tail which is alternative to the usual Green
function branch-cut argument.
At second-order, perturbation theory becomes much
more involved, but there are general considerations
which we may propose to arrive at some universal re-
sults. Consider for instance the multipole ℓ= 4 which
can be constructed out of the linear modes (2, ±2). Fol-
lowing closely Ref. [39], one can write the second-order
equation for ψ(2)
4±4(t, r) as

ψ(2)
4±4(r, t) = S4±4(r, t),
(5)
where S4±4(r, t) is the regularized quadratic source
built up with the linear modes (2, ±2). The key point is
that it behaves as ∼1/r2 at large radii (and as (r−2M)
close to the horizon)

The behaviour is in fact valid for any multipole, and in
the following it will suﬃce to use the following expres-
sion

r2

(7)
where ωℓis the QNM of the multipole (ℓ, ±ℓ). It rep-
resents the starting point for our considerations on the
nonlinear tails.
Nonlinear tails – As we have already mentioned, at
ﬁrst-order in perturbation theory, the QNMs arise from
the QNM component GQ of the Green’s function, while
the Price’s power-law tails come from the branch-cut
component GB. This indicates that both are generated
in a region in which the potential V (r) is important: the
ﬁrst-order QNMs are excited near the peak of the po-
tential barrier, and the ﬁrst-order tails emerge from the
long-range decay of the potential or, equiva- lently, the
fact that perturbations in a non-ﬂat space-time travel
not only on the light cone, but also inside it.
In contrast, the second-order power-law tail origi-
nates from the ﬂat part GF of the Green’s function,
meaning they are produced in asymptotically “ﬂat re-
gions”, and from the edge of the source distribution at
(t′−r′
∗) ≃u0 with some ﬁnite support. It might be sur-
prising that a non-oscillating tail can be produced by
oscillating QNMs, but it can be understood as follows
[64]: an observer at position (t, r∗) sees the edge (t′+r′
∗)
extending from (t−r∗) to (t+r∗) and cannot detect the
edge for (t′ + r′
∗) < t −r∗, as waves generated in this
region are partially scattered by the potential barrier
before reaching the observer. The ﬁrst-order perturba-
tions ψ(1)
ℓm(t′, r′
∗) ∼e−iω(t′−r′
∗) are constant along the
edge (t′ −r′
∗) ≃u0 and, therefore, they do not exhibit
oscillations, thus leading to long-lasting tails [64].
Now we arrive at a critical observation. Since the
source at large values of r decays at ∼1/r2, and since
V (r ≫2M) ≃ℓ(ℓ+ 1)
r2
,
(8)
it is clear that the ﬂat Green function GF may not be
evaluated neglecting such a leading term as it scales
with the same power of the source. In other terms, the
ﬂat part GF of the Green function must be calculated
taking the centrifugal term in the potential.
Imagine that QNMs turn on at a given time t0 at a
given point r0 (typically the photon ring r0 ≃3M for
ℓ≫1) and moves outward at light speed, with a ﬁnite
support in term of the retarded time u′ ≡(t′−r′
∗) ≃u0.
On the other hand the advanced time v′ ≡(t′ + r′
∗)
ranges from (t −r∗) to (t + r∗). We further assume
that the observer is located at points farther apart in
the time direction than in the radial direction, that is
t ≫r∗. Under these circumstances the source acquires
the form
Sℓ±ℓ(u, v) ∼e−2iωℓu0
r2(u0, v),
(9)
up to a multiplicative constant. The nonlinear tail is
therefore dictated by the integral
