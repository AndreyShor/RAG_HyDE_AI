the untuned voltages leads to highly-directive beams that
match well with simulations. The effectiveness of the untuned
voltages is particularly crucial in cases that tuning cannot be
applied easily, as in beamshaping cases of Sec. V-D.
Finally, the 3-dB fractional gain bandwidth of the RIS for
each case is ranging from 6.1% to 9.8% with an average
value of 7.5%. The main limitation stems from the resonant
behaviour of the unit cells that results in a frequency-dispersive
homogenized impedance. It is noted that the reported values
refer to the “instantaneous” bandwidth for ﬁxed sets of bias
voltages optimized for the center frequency of 5GHz. More-
over, the gain degradation is measured at the ﬁxed desired
angle, so beam-squinting effects also reduce the bandwidth.
D. Beamforming Measurements
The beamforming capabilities of the RIS have been exam-
ined through full-wave simulations in Sec. IV-B. Moreover,
it was shown that the beamforming is enabled by auxiliary
surface waves that are excited by high spectral components of
the induced currents. These surface waves require an accurate
framework to analyze the RIS response, such as the proposed
analysis through integral equations, as a simple reﬂect-array
model that disregards coupling effects is not sufﬁcient to
correctly predict the radiation pattern. In this section, the
optimized sets of surface impedances to realize sector patterns
of various beamwidths, as given in Fig. 6, are translated to DC
bias voltages and measurements are performed. It is recalled
that the frequency is 5GHz and the RIS is illuminated from
an incident angle of −15◦. Unlike the beamsteering cases, an
automated tuning is not possible in the sector-pattern cases,
since there is not a single angle that we aim to maximize
the reﬂected power. Hence, the radiation patterns for the
solutions obtained directly through the proposed optimization
framework are shown.
The three measured directivity patterns for the three sector
beams are plotted in Fig. 15(a)-(c) together with the simulated
patterns. As observed the measured patterns match satisfac-
torily with the simulations, with the respective angular pass
ranges identiﬁed as θm
pass = [−43◦, −16◦], [−50◦, −12.5◦]
and θm
pass = [−57.5◦, −4◦]. These angular pass ranges are
matching closely with the ones set as θpass in Eq. (14)
during optimization. Additionally, the directivity variation
within these ranges is 2.9dB, 2.5dB and 3dB, respectively.
Importantly, the sidelobe level (SLL) remains at least −10.9dB
compared to the peak value for all three sector patterns.
The sidelobes in the beamforming case were severely af-
fected in Fig. 8(b), when the radiation pattern was predicted
through the RA model. Similarly, a previous work that tried
to optimize the RIS for realizing a sector pattern based on
an RA model revealed issues with high SLL, probably due
to the inaccuracies introduced by disregarding the coupling
effects between adjacent unit cells [14]. Therefore, the results
herein demonstrate that the key pattern characteristics, even
for beamforming cases like the realized sector patterns, are
accurately preserved through our high-accuracy optimization
framework not only in full-wave simulations but also in the
measured results. Lastly, the power efﬁciency is estimated to
0.51, 0.52 and 0.53 for the three sector patterns, which are
close to the expected power efﬁciency values from full-wave
simulations.
VI. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the design of an RIS for beamsteering and
beamforming at 5 GHz was presented. The RIS consists
of varactor-loaded unit cells that are represented with a
tunable homogenized impedance. By optimizing the surface
impedances through a rigorous integral-equation framework,
the reﬂections of the RIS can be shaped into desired radiation
patterns, while a constraint can be placed on the total power
efﬁciency. Both the case of beamsteering to ±60◦and the case
of beamforming into sector patterns with varying beamwidth
