clustering on R was then accomplished using k-means clustering37 on the study population (i.e., 
all patients) with the number of clusters optimized by the algorithm and not chosen a priori. This 
was conducted to separate R into ‘phenogroups’, as similarly calculated by other investigators but 
for non-imaging phenotypes.38,39 
2.3 Calculation of imaging-derived health disparities indices (iHDI) 
The general concept for an iHDI is based upon the established HD*Calc framework,40 which was 
designed at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to provide a collection of measures to evaluate and 
monitor HDs. The indices in the HD*Calc framework were published in theoretical41 and case-
study format42 by the NCI in 2005 and 2007, respectively and are comprised of 11 relative and 
absolute measures of disparity.43 The HD*Calc framework typically involves inputting EHR 
health rate data (e.g., percent of the population with ‘high’ blood pressure and ‘high’ body mass 
index) into the health disparities measures.  
Calculating an iHDI using imaging-derived data requires the conversion of patient-level data 
to a health rate by group. Thus, for each of the phenogroups from the unsupervised clustering, we 
calculated the health status of each SDOH-related group as the ratio of (a) the number of patients 
in the SDOH-related group with R greater than the median R to (b) the number of patients in the 
SDOH-related group (Figure 3).
