Appendix A. CAPE for the Dry System
From Wallefe and Smith 2015, the classic Rayleigh-B´enard convection equations are:
Du
Dt = −∇ϕ + gαvTk + ν∇2u,
(A1)
DT
Dt = κ∇2T.
(A2)
Note that temperature here is equivalent to buoyancy in our model. A surface parcel
would maintain its temperature on adiabatic ascent (DT/Dt = 0), and so the parcel
profile is given by Tp(z) = T0. The basic state solution, for fixed temperature boundary
conditions T(0) = T0, T(H) = T1 is,
T = T0 −∆T
H z,
(A3)
where ∆T ≡T0 −T1. As in Section 2.4, we take the environment to be the basic state,
and we calculate the (dry) CAPE as:
CAPE =

(Tp −TE)dz = ∆T

z dz = H∆T

Note that Tp ≥TE at all heights, so pCAPE = CAPE, CIN = 0, LFC = 0, andLNB =
H. Recalling the expression for the Rainy number (Equation (26)), it follows that,
Ry = H3∆T

Therefore, the Rainy number is directly proportional to the classical Rayleigh number
for the dry system.
Appendix B. Radiative Rainy Number
We rescale the dry adiabatic non-dimensionalisation, using the minimum moist static
energy gradient of the basic state to set the timescale, and the height of the domain
to set the length scale. Note that, from equation (31),
dm
dz = rRa1/2(z −1).
(B1)
Next, we recall the alternative definition of conditional instability is dm/dz < 0 and
db/dz > 0, and note that dm/dz is a minimum at z = 0. Writing,
