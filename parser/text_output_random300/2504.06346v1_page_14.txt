Uncertainties are also assigned to account for assumptions made when defining the
signal angular distribution. A systematic uncertainty, due to neglecting angular resolution
effects, is estimated by smearing the signal model based on a resolution model in the
pseudoexperiment generation. The analysis also ignores small contributions from decays to
the K+K−e+e−final state where the K+K−pair does not originate from a ϕ meson. There
is no evidence for such contributions in the data. To estimate a systematic uncertainty,
a K+K−S-wave contribution is introduced at the level of 2% of the signal based on
the analysis of B0
s →ϕµ+µ−decays in Ref. [20]. The uncertainty on Γs and ∆Γs has a
negligible impact on the measured values of the observables but does impact D and the
interpretation of the measurement. The O(1%) production asymmetry between B0
s and
B0
s mesons in proton-proton collisions [45] has negligible impact on the measurements.
A systematic uncertainty is estimated by including a small background contribution in
the pseudoexperiment generation. At high q2 an uncertainty is also assigned in a similar
way to account for backgrounds from partially reconstructed decays of b hadrons to final
states including J/ψ and ϕ mesons, with too much bremsstrahlung energy recovered.

Results
Figure 7 shows the distributions of the selected candidates in m(K+K−e+e−), cos θK,
cos θe and Φ, in each of the q2 ranges, compared with the results of the fits. The data are
well described by the model.
The Feldman–Cousins procedure is used to obtain confidence level intervals for each
observable and for relevant pairs of observables. The likelihood ratio between the tested and
best-fit points is used as a test-statistic. At each tested point pseudoexperiments are used
to determine the expected distribution of the test-statistic and derive the corresponding
confidence level of the data. In the pseudoexperiment generation, nuisance parameters are
fixed to the values returned from the fit to the data at the given values of the parameters
of interest, i.e. using the plug-in method [46].
The resulting intervals on individual parameters are shown in Fig. 8, along with
two-dimensional intervals for (⟨FL⟩, ⟨A′
6⟩) and (⟨S3⟩, ⟨A9⟩) in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively.
The values for the rate-averaged and decay-time-integrated observables and their 68%
confidence level intervals are given in Table 2.
