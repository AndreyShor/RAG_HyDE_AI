Extend Data Fig.6 | Composited GMOC with its physical modes in CM2 simulation and coupled reanalysis. 
Same as Fig.3, but for the model simulation and coupled data assimilation of CM2 (CM2-HIS and CM2-CDA). The 
parameters α, β, and γ are the linear regression coefficients between the GMOC indices and ACC-RC, εm, NADW 
indices, respectively, as [α1, β1, γ1] = [0.39, −0.28, 0.04] and [α2, β2, γ2] = [0.30, 0.39, 0.01].
