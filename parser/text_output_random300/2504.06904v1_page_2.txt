problems related to the management and regulation of 
technological processes in gas transportation based on 
optimization methods and mathematical modeling. For 
this 
purpose, 
an 
algorithm 
for 
the 
operational 
management of gas transportation systems has been 
developed. This algorithm is based on the information 
obtained about the emergency state of pipelines by 
monitoring changes in the technological parameters of 
gas flow at the peripheral parts of the pipelines during 
emergency modes. This significantly enhances the 
reliability of gas supply management and the efficiency 
of transportation processes during the reconstruction 
phase of complex gas pipelines. 
At the current stage, the issues we face differ 
fundamentally from those already addressed [4, 8, 9, 15, 
16, 17, 18] in that they involve imposing specific 
requirements 
and 
time 
constraints 
during 
the 
development phase of the reconstruction concept for 
complex gas pipeline systems. This ensures the 
acquisition of structural, technical, and technological 
bases within the framework of future operation of 
complex gas pipeline systems, the clarification and 
elimination of technical and technological contradictions 
in the process of gas transportation system development 
and reconstruction, and the efficient management of the 
gas transportation system under modern conditions. 
 
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The essence of the studied method is to justify a 
targeted technological variant for reconstruction by 
increasing the efficiency of gas transportation under non-
stationary conditions.  Explores innovative approaches to 
modernizing existing control process monitoring systems 
within complex gas pipeline networks. These approaches 
integrate advancements in control theory and information 
technology to facilitate the selection of optimal 
emergency and operational modes. The reconstruction of 
gas transportation systems is characterized by the 
reliability of multi-level information bases transmitted to 
the dispatcher control center for complexes of local 
management 
systems 
of 
individual 
technological 
processes and objects. 
A highly reliable and efficient technological model is 
introduced to manage emergency processes in gas 
transportation. This model is designed according to the 
principles outlined in the reconstruction phase, aiming to 
increase system efficiency while minimizing response 
times during emergency situations. A highly reliable and 
efficient technological model has been proposed for 
managing emergency processes in gas transportation, 
based on the principles of the reconstruction phase. For 
complex gas pipeline systems, new approaches have been 
investigated for modernizing existing control process 
monitoring systems. These approaches are based on 
modern advancements in control theory and information 
technology, 
aimed 
at 
selecting 
emergency 
and 
technological modes. Figure 1 shows methodological 
process

technological 
and 
emergency 
mode 
management in the gas pipeline systems.

this study is the minimization of transmission time for 
measured and controlled data related to non-stationary 
flow parameters in gas networks. Efficient transmission 
of real-time data is essential for maintaining system 
integrity and safety during operation.
