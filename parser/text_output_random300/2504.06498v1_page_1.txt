We realize quantum oscillators operating at microhertz to tens of hertz fre-
quencies based on nuclear scalar couplings in molecules in solution. The oscillators
are implemented by coupling in situ hyperpolarized samples with programmable
digital feedback that allows amplifying specific 𝑱-coupling transitions at zero
field. Due to the fundamental insensitivity of 𝑱-couplings to magnetic field fluc-
tuations, we achieve extremely stable coherent oscillations for longer than 3000 s,
with a 337 µHz linewidth limited primarily by the measurement time. The ability
to control the feedback delay and the external gain enabled us to resolve over-
lapping resonances, making possible on-demand spectral editing. Importantly,
implementing active feedback allowed us to obviate the requirement of popula-
tion inversion and relax the requirements on sample polarization. The quantum
oscillator phenomenon demonstrated here for various chemical classes (nitriles,
heterocycles, and organic acids) significantly improves resolution of zero-field
NMR spectra, including for samples with natural isotopic abundance, and ex-
pands applications of 𝑱-spectroscopy.
