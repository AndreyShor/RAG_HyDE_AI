the µ-direction traces out the solid curves shown in the ℜWµ-ℑWµ plane on Figure 2. The
continuous lines are obtained from the analytic solution (2.7, 2.8) and their equations in each
ℜWµ-ℑWµ plane are shown in eqn. (B.1) in Appendix B. From the figure, it is clear that
the lattice minimum-action configurations (recall that there are 104 of them) cover the entire
moduli space.
Figure 3. Action density of the Q = 2/3 self-dual solution with r = k = 2. The lattice size is
L1, L2, L3, L4 = 16, 4, 8, 8, corresponding to a tuned T4 with ∆(2, 2, 1) = 0, eqn. (1.3). In each case,
we show the action density integrated over all coordinates but the one shown. We show the action
densities for all 85 configurations generated, plotted on top of each other.
For the multi-fractional instanton with r = k = 2, there are now 8 moduli, ϕ1
µ and ϕ2
µ.
Four linear combinations of them can be interpreted as translations of the center of mass of
the r = 2 “composite instanton” and four can be interpreted as relative positions of the r = 2
lumps,19 as per [27]. Here again, as (2.7, 2.8) and (2.10) show, each winding Wilson loop
Wµ only depends on 2 moduli, ϕC′=1
µ
and ϕC′=2
µ
. As these moduli are varied, the analytic
expressions for Wµ from (B.2) show that the solid curves on Figure 4 represent the boundary
of the moduli space (traced by varying the center of mass coordinate only, at vanishing relative
position) with the inside now filled by varying the “relative position” modulus. Again, we
find that the lattice minimum-action configurations appear to fill the moduli space.
Conclusion of section 3: We have presented ample analytic and numerical evidence that
for gcd(r, k) = r, the constant-F solutions of ’t Hooft on the tuned T4 with ∆(r, k, ℓ) = 0,
eqn. (1.3), are the only fractional instantons with Q = r
N . The gcd(r, k) = r case is singled out
19Strictly, the 2-lump picture applies only on the detuned torus, as there are no lumps for ∆= 0.
