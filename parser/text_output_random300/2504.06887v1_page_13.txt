One can observe from Eq.(50) that the mutual information I reaches its maximum when the separation between
(u1, v1) and (u4, v4), or between (u2, v2) and (u3, v3), is null. Conversely, it reaches its minimum when the separation
between (u1, v1) and (u3, v3), or between (u2, v2) and (u4, v4), is null. However, since we take the intervals to belong to
non-intersecting causal domains, these conditions are not satisfied, leading instead to a finite and nonnegative mutual
information6. Nevertheless, by keeping both intervals non-intersecting while bringing (u2, v2) and (u3, v3) close to null,
one can observe a peak in the mutual information plots (see Fig.2 and Fig.6). This point acts as a phase transition point
of the entanglement. One can refer to [75] for a discussion of the phase transition of the mutual transition by varying the
separation between adjacent intervals. Furthermore, the relation of the mutual information with entanglement negativity
between adjacent disjoint intervals has been discussed in [76; 77].
The properties of mutual information outlined above are applicable to all three vacua discussed in the previous section.
To study different other properties, we first write down the mutual information explicitly. Using Eq.(50), one gets the
following expressions of the mutual information for respective vacua :
IHHI = 1
12 log
(V1 −V3)2(U1 −U3)2(V2 −V4)2(U2 −U4)2
(V3 −V2)2(U3 −U2)2(V1 −V4)2(U1 −U4)2

,
(51)
IUnruh = 1
12 log
(v1 −v3)2(U1 −U3)2(v2 −v4)2(U2 −U4)2
(v3 −v2)2(U3 −U2)2(v1 −v4)2(U1 −U4)2

,
(52)
IBoulware = 1
12 log
(v1 −v3)2(u1 −u3)2(v2 −v4)2(u2 −u4)2
(v3 −v2)2(u3 −u2)2(v1 −v4)2(u1 −u4)2

.

The Kruskal coordinates U and V are given by: U = −2Rse−u/2Rs,
V = 2Rsev/2Rs. Let us introduce the dimensionless
variables ηs = vs/2Rs and ξs = us/2Rs.
The difference between the Boulware and Hartle-Hawking-Israel mutual
information is then expressed as
IBoulware −IHHI = 1
12 log
h(ξ4)
h(ξ3)
g(η4)
g(η3)

,
(54)
where the functions g(ηs) and h(ξs) are defined in Appendix E. Taking ξ1 > ξ2 > ξ3 > ξ4, the monotonicity of the function
h(ξs), under the assumptions given in Appendix E, implies h(ξ4) > h(ξ3). Furthermore, taking η1 < η2 < η3 < η4, the
monotonicity of the function g(ηs), under the considerable assumptions in Appendix E, implies g(η4) > g(η3). Therefore,
IBoulware > IHHI. Repeating the procedure outlined above, one can see that
IBoulware > IUnruh > IHHI
(55)
for sufficiently separated regions A and B. For illustration purposes, we show the plots for the mutual information in
different vacua from the perspective of a static observer in Fig. 2 and, from the perspective of a freely falling observer
in Fig.3. Therefore, the total correlation between the two disjoint intervals is minimal for the HHI vacuum compared
to the other two vacua, while it is maximal for the Boulware vacuum. This difference can be attributed to the presence
of Hawking radiation in the HHI and Unruh states, as opposed to only vacuum polarization in the Boulware state. It
suggests that the presence of Hawking radiation for a static observer reduces the total correlation. We will defer a
detailed analysis of the shapes of the plots in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 until Section 4, where we will also explore the mutual
information derived from entanglement harvesting using detectors.
Having described various vacua and the corresponding entanglement properties, we now proceed to the protocol of
entanglement harvesting in the next section.
6At this point, it is important to recall that the mutual information of a bipartite system is always non-negative. However, the tripartite
mutual information of two extended intervals can be negative [72].
