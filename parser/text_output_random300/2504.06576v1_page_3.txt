number condition, a prerequisite for the neglect of O(1/Re) terms, as postulated by Prandtl
theory (Landau 1976). The region outside the boundary layer can be regarded as an inviscid
potential flow (main flow), therefore the dynamic governing equation for the main flow
velocity 𝑈is simplified as
𝜌𝑈𝜕𝑈
𝜕𝑥= −𝜕𝑃
𝜕𝑥−𝜎𝐵2𝑈−𝜎𝐵𝜕𝜙

It can be inferred from the zero normal pressure gradient that 𝑝= 𝑃. Assuming that the
solid wall surface is electrically insulated, this boundary condition will result in the electrical
potential gradient term in momentum equations accounting for half of the total Lorentz force
(Fu et al. 2025). Consequently, the tangential N-S equation within the boundary layer is
expressed as follows
𝜌( 𝜕𝑢
𝜕𝑡+ 𝑢𝜕𝑢
𝜕𝑥+ 𝑣𝜕𝑢
𝜕𝑦) = 𝜌𝑈𝜕𝑈
𝜕𝑥+ 2𝜎𝐵2𝑈+ 𝜇𝜕2𝑢
𝜕𝑦2 −2𝜎𝐵2𝑢

The two-dimensional continuity equation enables the introduction of the Stokes stream
function, denoted by 𝜓, to rewrite the momentum equation

Here, the time scale of viscous dissipation within the boundary layer is employed to perform
a similarity transformation on the above momentum equation (Sun 2024). The dimensionless
time, normal coordinate, and stream function corrected by the MHD effect are, respectively,
as follows
𝜏= 𝜇𝑡

𝛿
(2.8)
𝜓= 𝑓(𝜏, 𝜂)𝛿(𝑥)𝑈(𝑥) = [𝑔(𝜏, 𝜂) −𝑓𝐿(𝜏, 𝜂)]𝛿(𝑥)𝑈(𝑥)
(2.9)
In above formulas, the 𝑓𝐿is a linear function with an explicit magnetic field strength
parameter, while 𝑔is a nonlinear function. The 𝛿represents the magnitude of boundary layer
thickness while the 𝛿0 in figure 1 represents the case without magnetic field. The momentum
equation of the boundary layer after this similarity transformation is

The self similarity condition requires that the coefficients of each term do not explicitly

the influence of external pressure on flow strength in the boundary layer. A comprehensive
investigation of the influence of the magnetic field on the stagnation flow and converging
flow boundary layers is elucidated in the following sections.

In a uniformly distributed magnetic field, the principle of similarity can be fully upheld
only when the boundary layer thickness 𝛿remains constant. Otherwise, the coefficient of the
