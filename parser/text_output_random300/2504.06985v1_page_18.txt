Table 5. Solving the systems of equations (3.12) and (3.13) we get a set of solutions, leading to a
factorized anomaly polynomial that can be embedded in the already known E8 end of the world brane
solution of M-theory [2, 3]. Here, we have restricted to positive chirality solutions, and the notation
nr,¯r = k, k ∈Z means that the combination (r ⊕¯r) appears k-times in (3.1) in agreement with reality
of representations in 10d.
term is absent in Cn algebras (this is also true for Bn and Dn algebras). Solutions that solve
both (3.12) and (3.13) are summarized in table 6 for algebras C3 and C4, again restricted
to solutions of positive chirality only. Only these cases are presented because we have not
found any nontrivial solution for Cn algebras with n > 4. This matches the fact that there
is no embedding of Cn>4 in E8. The solutions we found for C3, C4 indeed correspond to
E8 branchings.
We can actually give a direct argument that no solutions for n > 4 can
exist, just from looking at the tr(F 4) term in the anomaly polynomial: All representations of
dimension less than 248 have a positive contribution to this term, so with only chiral fields,
it is impossible to cancel the obstruction.

Table 6.
Solutions of C3 and C4 that can be embedded within M-theory.
Correspondingly, the
anomaly polynomial can be factorized as in the E8 solution.
A final comment (related to a remark in Subsection 3.1) is that for C3 we also found a
solution where all fields have positive chirality and the anomaly polynomial factorizes, but
not as it should to connect to M-theory. This is discussed in Appendix A. Again, we do not
know if this has any physical meaning.
