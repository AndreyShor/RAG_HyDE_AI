FIG. 4. Hybridization strength dependence of the Kondo tem-

erately but still nonzero, showing the robustness of the
Kondo breakdown transition. More details about the in-
ﬂuence of α are shown in Appendix C. Since both tf and
α are relatively small in realistic materials, the SKS with
a critical Vc is stable near the A-B pattern in a wider
range of the hybridization parameters.
C.
Strange metallicity
The existence of nonzero critical hybridization Vc ex-
plored here manifests the non-perturbation nature of the
present KS physics which cannot be accessed by smoothly
tuning the hybridization parameter from the completely
decoupled phase.
As consequence, the metallic state
emerging from the SKS phase is expected to be beyond
the description of the conventional Fermi liquid.
Evi-
dence for this unconventional metallic state comes also
from the Luttinger theorem which states that in a Fermi
liquid its Fermi volume does not change under the adia-
batic change of interaction parameters[57, 58].
In the present system, the lattice translational invari-
ance is preserved both in the paramagnetic phase as
well as in the simple collinearly ordered phases formed
by the f moments, since there are even number of f
sites in each unit cell.
Now assume that we can tune
the hybridization strength V from zero to a moderately
large value across Vc,B and Vc,A, so that the system un-
dergoes from the fully decoupled to the SKS and the
fully screened phases, successively. In the full-decoupled
phase, only c electrons contribute to the Fermi volume
of the original DSM, leading to the small Fermi vol-
ume VDSM =
(2π)2
2v0 (2nc mod 2). Here, the factor of 2
and
mod 2 account for the spin degeneracy and ﬁlled
bands, respectively, and v0 the unit cell volume. This is
in agreement with Luttinger’s theorem [57, 58] although
the Fermi surface closes at nc = 1 for the ideal DSM.
In the full-screened Kondo phase, both c and f electrons
contribute to the formation of the HF liquid (HFL), with
the total number of electrons per unit cell being given by
ntot = 2nc + 2nf = 2nc + 2. Usually, the Fermi volume
should be large in this case. But here the correspond-
ing Fermi volume is VHFL = (2π)2
2v0 (ntot mod 2), still in
agreement with Luttinger’s theorem and the system is in
the HFL phase for nc ̸= 1 or the KI phase for nc = 1.
In the SKS phase, however, the Fermi volume is con-
tributed by c electrons and half of the f electrons (in the
B-sublattice), given by VSKS =
(2π)2
2v0 (2nc + 1 mod 2).
This intermediate Fermi volume is large and violates Lut-
tinger’s theorem since there is a jump in the Fermi vol-
ume either from the full-decoupled phase or from the
full-screened phase. Moreover, the SKS phase at the half
ﬁlling ( nc = 1 ) is necessarily in a metallic state. This
is in striking contradiction to the conventional Kondo
lattice system where a Kondo insulator state appears at
half-ﬁlling.
To reveal the essential features of the SKS phase, we
calculate the band structure in the A-B pattern at half-
ﬁlling using the reduced three-band Hamiltonian. There
are three diagonalized energy bands for the hybridized
quasiparticles as plotted in Fig.5(a). The ﬁrst (upper)
and third (lower) bands, which resemble the conventional
heavy fermion valence and conduction bands, are well-
separated by a relatively larger direct band gap ∼2.0
(the conventional Kondo gap).
In addition, the second (middle) band is nearly ﬂat,
located around the Fermi energy and separated from both
the upper and lower bands as shown in Fig.5(a).
Its
bandwidth is proportional to r2
B and is almost suppressed
near the boundary of the Kondo phase. Nevertheless, this
band still shows the k-dependent dispersion as could be
detected in the right panel in Fig.5(b) (where the band
structure is ampliﬁed just for visibility): it has several
dips located at the Dirac points (the K-point) in the k-
space as a result of the C3 symmetry.
The energy separation between these three hybridiz-
ing bands can be more clearly observed in the density of
states (DOS) as shown in Fig.6(a). A three-peak struc-
ture is readily seen due to the presence of energy gaps
between them. Consequently, the contributions to each
peaks can be distinguished by the respective bands. More
remarkably, there is a Van Hove singularity in the DOS
contributed from the second band (the nearly ﬂat band)
around the Fermi energy as shown in Fig.6(a) ( Notice
that its DOS is reduced by 1/10 in Fig.6(a) for better
illustration ). This singularity is clearly due to the hy-
bridized quasiparticles near the M-point as shown in the
inset of Fig.5. In order to determine its precise location
in energy, we calculated the DOS’s of this band for much
lower temperatures ranging from β = 400 to β = 10000,
plotted in Fig.6(b). We ﬁnd that the singularity is pre-
cisely shifted to the Fermi level at the low-temperature
limit as shown in the inset of Fig.6(b).
Further, we calculate the low-temperature susceptibil-
