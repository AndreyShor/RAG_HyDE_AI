FIG. 5: We present similar plots to Fig. 1. All the parameters
are the same, apart from pec = 0.4.
We observe that the
secret key rate is lower than the corresponding one in the
previous ﬁgure. However, the achievable loss has been slightly
improved. We see also very similar performance in terms of
the other parameters β, R∗
code, leakage, and Msparse.

FIG. 7: We present similar plots to Fig. 1. All the parameters
are the same, apart from assuming a doubled value for block
size N = 4 × 105. We observe that the secret key rate takes
higher values and the achievable loss has been signiﬁcantly
increased. The leakage level and n has been increased in the
same manner (almost doubled) and similarly M ∗
sparse.
The
other parameters have remained in similar levels as before.
