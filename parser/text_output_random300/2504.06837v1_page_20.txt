Moreover, we have the lower limit inequalities
lim inf
N→∞DN(cN, F N, JN) ≥D(ρ, f, j)
and
lim inf
N→∞EN(cN(t)) ≥E(ρ(t)) for all t ∈[0, T],
for the functionals deﬁned in (3.1), (3.5), (3.7), and (3.8), respectively.
In particular, for well-prepared initial data, i.e., ιNcN(0) →ρ(0) with EN(cN(0) →E(ρ(0)),
it holds
lim inf
N→∞LN(cN, F N, JN) ≥L(ρ, f, j).
To conclude that the limit (ρ, f, j) solves the limit gradient-ﬂow equation, we need in addi-
tion a chain rule inequality for the continuous reaction-diﬀusion system. (Recall D and L from
Deﬁnition 3.11.)
Theorem 4.8 (Chain rule inequality for continuum system). Consider a curve (ρ, f, j) ∈CE
with ess supt∈[0,T] E(ρ(t)) < ∞and D(ρ, f, j) < ∞.
In addition, assume that the reaction
coeﬃcients satisfy (4.A2).
Then, for every 0 ≤s < t ≤T it holds
E(ρ(t)) −E(ρ(s)) +
Z t
s
R(ρ(τ), f(τ), j(τ)) + S(ρ(τ)) dτ ≥0.
Furthermore, it holds L(ρ, f, j) = 0 if and only if ρ is a continuum EDB solution of (1.2) in
the sense of Deﬁnition 3.13.
The three theorems together imply that solutions of the discrete problems (1.3) on Zd
N
starting from well-prepared initial data converge (after choosing a suitable subsequence) to
solutions of the continuous reaction-diﬀusion system (1.2). This is summarized in our ﬁnal
main result.
Corollary 4.9 (Convergence of solutions). Assume that the reactions satisfy (4.A2). Let ρ0 ∈
L1(X) satisfy E(ρ0) < ∞. Let (cN
0 )N∈N with cN
0 ∈L1(XN) be well-prepared, i.e., let ιNcN
0 →ρ0
in L1(X) and EN(cN
0 ) →E(ρ0) as N →∞.
Then, for each N ∈N there exists a solution cN ∈L1(0, T; M+(XN)) of (1.3) on Zd
N in the
sense of Deﬁnition 3.8 with initial datum cN
0 .
Furthermore, (up to a subsequence) we have ιNcN →ρ strongly in L1([0, T]×X), where ρ is
a solution of the gradient ﬂow equation (1.2) on Td in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.13 with initial
datum ρ0.
The proofs of the main results are given in the next two sections: In Section 5, we show the
necessary compactness and the lower limit of dissipation functionals leading to Theorem 4.7. In
Section 6 we show that the chain rules and energy-dissipation principles for both, the discrete
and the continuous, reaction-diﬀusion systems hold.
Finally, we comment on the restrictions on the stoichiometric vectors. In fact, they are
needed for deriving suitable a priori bounds. If however, these bounds can be obtained by
other means, then the conditions can be dropped completely.
