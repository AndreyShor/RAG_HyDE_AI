ﬁelds2. For a 2D QFT equipped with a Z2 symmetry, one can turn on a background
ﬁeld A1 for this Z2 symmetry. If this symmetry is anomalous, then the partition
function of the 2D QFT is not invariant under the Z2 symmetry transformation.
Instead, it picks up a phase
Z[A1] →Z[A1 + δα0] = Z[A1]exp (iπ ∫M2
α0
δA1
2 )
(6.1)
Resolving the above anomaly amounts to curing the phase ambiguity of the
partition function when coupling to the symmetry background ﬁeld. To achieve
that, let us ﬁrst introduce another Z2 background ﬁeld B1, and stack a Z2×Z2 SPT
phase onto the 2D QFT. The resulting partition function coupled to the Z2 × Z2
background reads
Z[A1]exp (iπ ∫M2
A1 ∪B1),
(6.2)
where the second factor corresponds to a Z2 × Z2 SPT, or equivalently, a discrete
torsion.
Let us again perform the Z2 symmetry transformation for A1
Z[A1]exp(iπ ∫M2
A1 ∪B1)
Ð→
Z[A1]exp (iπ ∫M2
α0
δA1
2 )exp (iπ ∫M2
A1 ∪B1)exp (iπ ∫M2
δα0 ∪B1),
Ð→
Z[A1]exp (iπ ∫M2
A1 ∪B1)exp (iπ ∫M2
α0(δA1
2
−δB1)).
(6.3)
Imposing the condition
δB1 = δA1
2 ,
(6.4)
the partition function (6.2) will be free of phase ambiguity, and the anomaly is
thus resolved. However, the condition we impose implies that the two Z2’s do not
build a direct product, but a group extension
1 Ð→Z(B)
2
Ð→Z4 Ð→Z(A)
2
Ð→1.
(6.5)
The Z(B)
2
is trivially-acting in the sense that its background ﬁeld is only involved
in the discrete torsion exp(iπ ∫M2 A1 ∪B1), thus does not act on any genuine local
operators of the 2D QFT.
