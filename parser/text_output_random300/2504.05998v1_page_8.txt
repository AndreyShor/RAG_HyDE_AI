Rewriting Eq. (S.8) as

(S.12)
we recognize a familiar structure: the GIT channel from the optical input of the first cavity ain1(ω) to the optical output of
the second cavity aout2(ω) is a phase-insensitive thermal attenuator [19, 20] with transmissivity η(ω) = |α1(ω)|2 and thermal
occupation number N(ω) given in Eq. (S.11). Notice that the phase factor eiφ(ω) = α1(ω)/|α1(ω)| is irrelevant for the quantum
properties of the channel since it can be absorbed into a redefinition of the input operator a′
in1(ω) = eiφ(ω)ain1(ω). The explicit
expression of the effective transmissivity of the GIT channel ain1(ω) →aout2(ω) is:
η(ω) = |α1(ω)|2 =
k2g4λ2
| det{A + iω}|2 .
(S.13)
The explicit expression for the effective thermal occupation number of the GIT channel is:
N(ω) = |β1(ω)|2 + |β2(ω)|2
1 −|α1(ω)|2
NT = κγg2NT
λ2(κ2/4 + ω2) + (g2 + κγ/4 −ω2)2 + (κω/2 + γω/2)2
(1 −η(ω))| det{A + iω}|2
.
(S.14)
When evaluating the non-classicality criterion introduced in Eq. (8) of the main text, the term | det(A + iω)|2 simplifies and we
obtain
η(ω)
[1 −η(ω)]N(ω) =
|α1(ω)|2
NT[|β1(ω)|2 + |β2(ω)|2] =
g2κλ2
NTγ[λ2(κ2/4 + ω2) + (g2 + κγ/4 −ω2)2 + (κω/2 + γω/2)2] ≥1.
(S.15)
In Fig. S.1, we plot the transmissivity η(ω) and the output noise [1 −η(ω)]N(ω) for a specific choice of parameters. The plot
demonstrates two main phenomena: the emergence of GIT in a narrow frequency band at the cavity resonance frequency and its
non-classical nature according to Eq. (S.15).

FIG. S.1. Spectral analysis of the gravitationally-induced transparency (GIT) phenomenon. The transmissivity η(ω) (full line) and the output
noise [1 −η(ω)]N(ω) (dashed line) for different frequencies of the input mode ain1(ω). The frequency is defined in interaction picture, such
that the origin ω = 0 is centered at the cavity frequency ωA. The frequency window between the two dotted lines is the estimated transparency
linewidth according to Eq. (S.22). The light-green region highlights the frequency window in which the effective transmission channel Φω =
Eη,N is a non-classical quantum attenuator according to (S.15), i.e., where the transmissivity exceeds the output noise. The physical parameters
used in this plot are: ωB = 2π × 0.03 Hz, γ = 10−14ωB, κ = 0.1ωB, λ = w2
G/ωB = 3.58 × 10−6 Hz, NT = [exp(ωB/wT) −1]−1 = 6.94 × 108,
where wG is given by Eq. (S.44) assuming two nearby gold spheres and where wT is given by (S.44) assuming a temperature of T = 1 mK.
The optomechanical coupling rate is set to its optimal value gopt = ( √κ/2)(γ2 + 4λ2)1/4 ≃1.84 × 10−4 Hz, according to Eq. (S.16).
A.
The special case ω = 0
We expect the optimal transmission to happen at the resonance frequency ωA of the optical cavities which, in the reference
frame used for performing the rotating wave approximation, corresponds to ω = 0. So we first focus on this special case. Later,
we will show that the non-resonant case ω , 0 is indeed suboptimal. Evaluating (S.15) at ω = 0 and maximizing it over g, we
get
