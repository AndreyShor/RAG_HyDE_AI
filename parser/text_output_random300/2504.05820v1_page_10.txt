of non-perturbative generated charm quarks to the proton wave function. Ref. [1] provides a
first evidence of this effect starting from the NNPDF4.0 PDF analysis, and validates the result
with a comparison to the most recent data, from the LHCb experiment, which could potentially
be sensitive to this phenomenon. In the last part of the chapter, based on Ref. [2], I investigate
the possibility of finding an intrinsic charm asymmetry in the proton, which could definitively
shed light on this topic.
In Chapter 4, I present the most up-to-date global PDF analysis from the NNPDF collaboration [3]
which includes the known four-loop and three-loop QCD corrections to PDF evolution and DIS
predictions, respectively. This allows the extraction of PDFs at approximate next-to-next-to-next-
to-leading order (N3LO) with a consistent treatment of underlying theoretical uncertainties and
provides a fundamental input to improve the accuracy of both future and experimental high
energy physics analysis.
Chapter 5 outlines my most recent work [4] about a new determination of helicity dependent
proton PDFs. The study improves previous results, both from the theoretical and methodological
points of view, and it will be beneficial to upcoming interpretations of polarized scattering
measurements, for instance, from the EIC. Finally, Chapter 6 contains a summary of the work.
All the presented results are provided along with open source codes and corresponding testing
suites, which facilitate their development and maintenance.
