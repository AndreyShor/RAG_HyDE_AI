Case E = ¯E. We first specialize eq. S8 to the
case E = ¯E.
We note that eZk −f

W ∗( ¯E) for all intervals that include ¯E. Additionally,
the term nj( ¯E) eZj in the numerator can be written
as nj( ¯E)Z∗

rewritten as:

(S9)
where the non-negative coefficient A is ≤1 because
nj ≤Nj.
Case E ̸= ¯E. The update via eq. S8 will generally
propagate the initial pointwise perturbation to the
neighborhood of ¯E, and specifically to the Ws of
energy levels spanned by intervals that include ¯E.
Thus, we shall now consider E ̸= ¯E. In this case, for
intervals that include ¯E, we have eZj −f
W( ¯E) = Z∗
j −
W ∗( ¯E)+∆W, otherwise eZj −f
W( ¯E) = Z∗
j −W ∗( ¯E).
Taking this into account and expanding the right-
hand side of eq. S8 to linear order in ∆W, one ob-
tains:
f
W ′(E) = W ∗(E) + α(B1 −B2)∆W

with the double prime indicating that the sums are

Considering that: (i) 0 ≤W( ¯E) ≤Zj −W ∗, (ii)
W ∗(E) ≤Zj, and using the identity of eq. S1 for
the fixed point solution, one has the following upper
bounds:
B1 ≤

We thus obtain the following bound for the per-
turbation propagated by the update:
∥f
W ′(E) −f
W(E)∥≤2αW ∗(E)
W ∗( ¯E)∆W .
(S13)
Combining expressions S9 and S13, we have that
the overall perturbation of the updated array has a
norm smaller than the initial one as long as the re-
laxation parameter α is sufficiently small compared
to the largest ratio of pairs of W ∗s in the same in-
tervals. To leading order, for non-pointwise pertur-
bations, the updated entries f
W ′(E) will differ from
W ∗by the linear combination of terms analogous to
those of eqs. S9 and S10. Because such terms are
bound, and their number is no larger than the pre-
assigned number of bins per interval, a sufficiently
small - though finite - value of α will ensure that the
norm of the perturbation decays at each iteration
step. The fixed point solution is thus an attractor
for the iterative procedure.
C.
Approximate solution for initialization
We now derive an approximate solution to the self-
consistent equations S1 - S3. Given its simplicity,
the approximate solution can be straightforwardly
used as the starting point of the iterative scheme,
making convergence significantly faster than, e.g.,
starting from an initially flat W profile.
The approximation hinges on the assumption that
the individual W elements are much smaller than the
Zs of the intervals containing them. In this limit, the
self-consistent equation S1 reduces to:
W(E) =

nj(E)

Setting all g’s equal to 1 for simplicity and rearrang-
ing the terms, the equation can be rewritten more
conveniently as:

Analytical solution
We further assume that the energy range of inter-
est is spanned by intervals (hence histograms) that
overlap only at the edge bins. The requirement of
histograms overlapping at the edges is not restrictive
in applicative contexts, in that multiple histogram
coverages can always be downsampled a posteriori
to meet this condition.
