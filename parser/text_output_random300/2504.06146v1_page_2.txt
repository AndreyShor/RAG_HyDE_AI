FIG. 1. R´enyi−2 entanglement asymmetry for the charge Qy
of the eigenstates of the mixed-field Ising Hamiltonian (2)
with L = 16 sites in the chaotic point g = 1.1, h = 0.35 for a
subsystem of length ℓA = 4 (blue points) and ℓA = 11 (green
points). The energy density ε of the eigenstates is rescaled by
ε∗= 1.54, as explained in the main text. The black continu-
ous lines are the analytical prediction (7) obtained using the
ensemble of U(1)-symmetric Haar random states, with con-
served charge orthogonal to Qy. The blue and green shaded
regions correspond to the confidence interval E[∆S(2)
A ] ± 3σ,
where the variance σ is estimated numerically by sampling
the ensemble of U(1)-symmetric random states.
The grey
dashed lines are the prediction (8) of the standard Haar uni-
tary ensemble, which is expected to only capture the behavior
of midspectrum eigenstates (ε ∼0).
nian H, i.e. it can be partitioned as H = HA+HB+HAB,
where HA (HB) only acts on A (B) and HAB contains
all of the terms coupling A and B.

B, where |ψEi⟩A(B) is an
eigenstate of HA(B) with energy Ei. A key observation,
first analyzed in [1], is that the locality of the interaction
HAB makes the matrix cij banded; that is, cij is non-zero
only for energies Ei + Ej ∈[E −δ/2, E + δ/2], where δ
is set by the interaction term HAB. The locality of the
interactions implies that δ ∼O(1). More rigorously, it
is possible to prove that cij are upper bounded by a de-
creasing exponential in Ei + Ej −E [69]. Refs. [13, 14]
used this idea to construct states consistent with the sub-
system ETH [70] and that describe universal properties
of finite-temperature eigenstates of chaotic Hamiltoni-
ans. A further approximation assumed in Refs. [31, 32]
is the coarse-graining of the spectrum of HA(B) with the
scale δ by assigning to all the eigenstates in the win-
dow εk −δ/2 ≤Ei ≤εk + δ/2 the same energy εk. This
identification effectively discretizes the spectrum and cre-
ates degenerate energy subspaces HA(B)(εk). As a result,
the typical eigenstates can be approximately written as
|ψE⟩≈P
k cεk |ψεk⟩with |ψεk⟩∈HA(εk) ⊗HB(E −εk),
akin the structure of states with a global U(1) symmetry.
Based on this approximation, Refs. [31, 32] conjecture
that the properties of typical eigenstates of local chaotic
Hamiltonians are captured by random states subject to
this symmetry constraint.
As shown in [31], this U(1)-symmetric random state
ensemble not only gives a better prediction than the Haar
ensemble of the entanglement entropy at zero energy
density but it is also able to capture the universal en-
tanglement properties of finite-temperature eigenstates.
These eigenstates have typically less entanglement en-
tropy than the infinite-temperature one, as the fraction
of the Hilbert space they can explore is smaller. This ef-
fect can be modeled by changing in the ensemble the sec-
tor of the total conserved charge. After introducing the
ensemble of U(1)-symmetric random states in the next
paragraph, we describe how to make this correspondence
in detail.
U(1)-symmetric random state ensemble.— The ensem-
ble of U(1)-symmetric random states employed in [31, 32]
was initially studied in [16, 18]. A complete characteriza-
tion of the first two moments of the entanglement entropy
has been given in [15] and of its symmetry-resolution
in [71, 72]. To define it, we need to consider a charge op-
erator Q that generates a global U(1) group. The Hilbert
space of the full system can be then decomposed as the
direct sum of each charge sector, H = ⊕MH(M), where
M is an eigenvalue of Q. If we take a bipartition of the
system in subsystems A and B and we assume that the
total charge is the sum of the contributions of A and B,
Q = QA + QB, then the subspace H(M) of fixed total
charge M further decomposes as
H(M) =
M
q
HA(q) ⊗HB(M −q).
(1)
Thus, the U(1)-symmetric states |Ψ(M)⟩∈H(M), i.e.
those satisfying Q |Ψ(M)⟩= M |Ψ(M)⟩, can be writ-
ten as |Ψ(M)⟩= P
q
√pq |ψq⟩, where |ψq⟩∈HA(q) ⊗
HB(M −q).
The corresponding reduced density ma-
trix that describes the subsystem A is of the form ρA =
P
q pqρA(q). Here pq is the probability of finding a charge
q in A. In Ref. [15], it is proved that the uniform mea-
sure over H(M) subject to the symmetry constraint (1)
is equal to the product of the uniform measure in each
subspace HA(q) ⊗HB(M −q), which is the usual Haar
unitary measure, times the probability measure over the
coefficients {pq}, which is given by the Dirichlet distri-
bution with parameters dq = dA,qdB,q, where dq is the
dimension of the space HA(q)⊗HB(M −q) for each pos-
sible q.
Hamiltonian model.— As a concrete example, we
consider the one-dimensional Mixed-Field Ising Model
(MFIM), a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos [5, 9,
75]. This is a spin-1/2 chain with Hamiltonian:
H =

(σz
