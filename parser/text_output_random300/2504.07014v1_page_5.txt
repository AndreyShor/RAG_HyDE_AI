Gapless-to-gapless Lifshitz transition in the IC phase
A new feature occurs when two dimerized (δ ̸= 0) chains are coupled in a ladder (t⊥̸= 0).
The band structure reveals a Lifshitz transition within the gapless phase. Two bands ε±(k)
are split, even if the staggered potential µa is absent, see Fig. 2b. As a consequence, a
new transition occurs at µL ∈(µc,1, µc,2), when the number of Fermi points doubles 2 →4,
yielding a cusp of ¯n(µ) in the IC phase, seen in Fig. 2d. The full account of the analysis
and exact results for the physical parameters are presented in Sec. A 1.
The compressibility is plotted in Fig. 3. Two plateaux in the gapped phases are the

the critical points are: µc,1 = 0.68, µL = 1.12, µc,2 = 1.36.
incompressible states of fermions, and the compressibility is singular near the quantum
critical points µc,1/2:

in agreement with earlier results [33]. The compressibility is also singular on one side from
the Lifshitz transition in the gapless IC phase, where ¯n(µ) demonstrates a cusp:

So, for all three transitions the critical index of susceptibility γ = 1/2. With µ growing
from zero and crossing over the upper critical value µc,2, the system undergoes a sequence
of the second order transitions accompanied by the change of the Fermi points number:
0 →2 →4 →2 →0 (note that at µ = µc,2: kF,1 = −kF,2). Two critical points at µc,1 and
µc,2 are the Lifshitz transitions as well, since the number of the Fermi points changes 0 ↔2.
The transitions at µc,1/2 are accompanied by the gap closure/openning at the boundary
with the IC phase. A particularly interesting feature of the Lifshitz transition at µL is that
it occurs inside the quantum critical state, which is gapless and the correlation length is
infinite. Regardless the presence or absence of the gap, changing of the Fermi points (±2)
is signalled by the same type of singularity, cf. Eqs. (8) and (9).
