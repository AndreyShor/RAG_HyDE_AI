the accuracy of our modeling and the predominant role of de-
coherence in limiting the performance of the VQE algorithm.
For comparison, we also perform numerical simulations of the
circuit using an ideal noise-free model, as shown by the yel-
low triangles in Fig. 4. The close alignment between the ex-
act ground state energies and the simulation with ideal model
confirms the effective of the qubit-efficient VQE algorithm.
In evaluating the scalability of our approach, we note
that systems with bounded entanglement, such as 1D cluster
states [21], allow the MPS-based representation to scale effec-
tively with minimal loss of accuracy. Since the transverse field
Ising model exhibits low entanglement away from the quan-
tum critical region, our circuit is expected to efficiently simu-
late larger spin systems without substantial accuracy loss. To
assess the potential for further enhancing the accuracy of our
qubit-efficient VQE, we perform numerical simulations incor-
porating higher-order error mitigation techniques [34]. These
simulations indicate that extending the analog error mitigation
to higher orders can significantly reduce the remaining dis-
crepancies, bringing the mitigated results closer to the ideal
ground state energies. While experimental implementation
of higher-order mitigation is not feasible in the current setup
due to practical limitations, these simulation results highlight
promising avenues for future research in error mitigation tech-
niques.

CONCLUSION
In this work, we experimentally demonstrated a qubit-
efficient VQE algorithm on a superconducting quantum pro-
cessor, addressing the challenges posed by the limited qubit
resources and high noise levels of NISQ devices. By lever-
aging an MPS representation, we efficiently simulated the
ground state energies of an N +1-spin circular transverse-field
Ising model using only two physical qubits: a transmon qubit
and a high-coherence photonic mode. We validated the qubit-
efficient VQE and analog error mitigation approach by deter-
mining the ground state energies of the 4-spin Ising model,
demonstrating improved precision compared to unmitigated
results.
The methods developed here can be readily extended to
other quantum algorithms and larger system sizes [12, 41],
paving the way for tackling more complex problems in quan-
tum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and optimization.
However, it is important to recognize the limitations of the
current approach. The reliance on the MPS representation re-
stricts the class of quantum states that can be efficiently en-
coded, particularly those with high entanglement across all
qubits. Additionally, while the analog error mitigation proto-
col is effective for suppressing certain types of noise, it may
not be sufficient for mitigating all sources of errors in the
quantum system. Overcoming these limitations will require
the development of more advanced qubit encodings, enhanced
error mitigation techniques, and the potential integration with
quantum error correction schemes.
