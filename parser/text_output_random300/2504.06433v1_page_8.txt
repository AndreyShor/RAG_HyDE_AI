they must represent disjoint sets of variables. We deﬁne polyH,J : H ⊗J →C[{xs} ∪{yt}] to be
the unique linear map such that
polyH,J (|s⟩⊗|t⟩) = polyH(|s⟩) · polyJ (|t⟩) = xsyt
for all s ∈{0, 1}k and t ∈{0, 1}ℓ. Since the variable sets {xs} and {yt} are disjoint, we have that
polyH,J is one-to-one. It is also easily checked that for all u ∈H and v ∈J ,
polyH,J (u ⊗v) = polyH(u) · polyJ (v) .
Note that polyH,J is not the same as polyH⊗J ; the former maps to quadratic polynomials and
the latter to linear polynomials. We can extend this idea to tensor products of several spaces (we
will need two, three, and four), choosing disjoint sets of variables for each: For example, letting
H1, H2, H3, H4 be spaces of k, ℓ, m, n qubits, respectively, we deﬁne
polyH1,H2,H3,H4(|s⟩⊗|t⟩⊗|u⟩⊗|v⟩) = xsytzuwv
(1)
for all binary strings s, t, u, v of length k, ℓ, m, n, respectively, where {xs}, {yt}, {zu}, {wv} are dis-
joint set of variables, and extend by linearity to all of H1 ⊗H2 ⊗H3, ⊗H4.

Irreducibility Results
In this section we present results used to prove the Entanglement Lemma (Lemma 4.3), which in
turn is used to prove our depth-2 QAC-circuit lower bound (Theorem 6.1). The results here may
be of independent interest, however, and can potentially be used to prove stronger versions of the
lemma and stronger circuit lower bounds. We state the lemmas for ﬁeld F = C, but they hold as
well over any suﬃciently large ﬁeld.6
Shpilka and Volkovich [SV10] gave a characterization of when a set I ⊆[n] is a union of sets
from the variable-partition of f.
Lemma 3.1 ([SV10, Lemma 3.2]). Let f ∈F[x] be a polynomial and let a ∈Fn be a justifying
assignment of f. Then I ⊆[n] satisﬁes f(a) · f ≡f|xI=a · f|x[n]\I=a, if and only if I is a union of
sets from the variable-partition of f.
We will use the following consequence of Lemma 3.1.
Corollary 3.2. Let f ∈F[x] be a polynomial. If there exists a justifying assignment a of f such
that f(a) = 0, then f is indecomposable.
Proof. For simplicity of notation let var(f) = [n]. Let a be any justifying assignment of f. Sup-
pose f decomposes into f = gh, where g, h are non-constant and variable-disjoint. Let I = var(g).
Then I ̸= ∅is the disjoint union of sets from the variable-partition of f and var(h) = [n]\I. Hence,
by Lemma 3.1 we have
f(a) · f ≡f|xI=a · f|x[n]\I=a.
Because a is justifying, we have f|xI=a ̸≡0 and f|x[n]\I=a ̸≡0. Therefore f(a) · f ̸≡0, whence
f(a) ̸= 0.
6Some trivial modiﬁcations are needed for ﬁelds with characteristic 2 or 3.
