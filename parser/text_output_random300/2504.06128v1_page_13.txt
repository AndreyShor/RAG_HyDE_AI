SINGULARITY AND REGULARITY OF THE CRITICAL 2D SHF

The following result compares RLp¨q and Gp¨q. The proof is given in Appendix A.
Lemma 2.1 (Green’s function). Uniformly for L P N and z P Z2 we can write
RLpzq “ 2 G

Moreover, for any t P p0, 8q, there is ct ą 0 such that
uniformly for L P N, z P Z2

(2.10)
(The restriction |z| ď L in (2.10) ensures that RLpzq ě q2Lpzq ą 0 for z P Z2
even.)
2.3. Polynomial chaos expansion. Let us introduce random variables
ξβ
n,x :“ eβωpn,xq´λpβq
σβ
,
which are i.i.d. with zero mean and unit variance, thanks to the definition (1.16) of σβ. We
can represent the point-to-plane partition function Zβ
Lpxq as a polynomial chaos expansion:

see e.g. [CSZ20, eq. (2.17)]. This follows from the definition (1.17)-(1.18) by writing

and then expanding the product.
Remark 2.2 (Switching off some disorder). We will later consider partition functions
where disorder is “switched off” in a time interval pA, Bs Ď p0, Ls, meaning that the Hamil-
tonian Hβ
p0,Ls is replaced by Hβ
p0,As ` Hβ
pB,Ls, see (1.18). This amounts to setting ξn,x “ 0 for
all n P pA, Bs, which is equivalent to restricting the polynomial chaos (2.11) to sequences of
times n1, . . . , nk which avoid the interval pA, Bs.
2.4. Second moment of point-to-plane partition function. Recalling
(1.16), we define a weighted renewal function Uβp¨q by setting Uβp0q :“ 1 and for n ě 1
Uβpnq :“

where the last equality holds by the fact that ř
