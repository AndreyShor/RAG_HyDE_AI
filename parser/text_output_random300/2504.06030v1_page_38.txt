Once more this result is easy to generalise to any Hamiltonian system with periodic

Later we give our Kepler equation in this setting in terms of the Weierstrass elliptic
function ℘. See Theorem 7.3 in the Appendix.
5. Quantum Mechanics, Elementary Formula and Burgers-Zeldovich Fluids
The key to the two results herein is the existence of a certain diffeomorphism, Dt : Rn →
Rn, t ∈(0, T), D0 = id, the identity, arising from the classical Newtonian mechanics in
this setup and its relation to Schr¨odinger heat equations, for small times, T. The proof
of the necessary and sufficiency of conditions for the existence of T > 0 can be found in
Elworthy and Truman, Ref. [11].
5.1. Stochastic Mechanics, Nelson Newton Law and Burgers Equation
For simplicity here we consider a putative particle of unit mass P, with −→

H = p2
