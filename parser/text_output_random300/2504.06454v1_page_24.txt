range. The composition of (Nb, 5 at.% Zr, 5 at.% Pt)67Ti33 was synthesized using the
arc-melting method. Samples with varying annealing conditions, denoted as AC, AN,
SQ, and SQA, were prepared. The AC sample received no heat treatment (as-cast).
The heat treatment protocols for the other samples were as follows: AN—annealing
at 1100 ◦C for 9 hours; SQ—solutionizing for 9 hours followed by quenching; and
SQA—solutionizing for 9 hours, quenching, and subsequent annealing at 1100 ◦C for
9 hours. Figure 23 presents the XRD patterns of the AC, AN, and SQ samples. In all
samples, the primary phase is the bcc structure, identiﬁed as the Nb-Ti phase through
chemical composition analysis. Additionally, AN and SQ samples exhibit stoichiomet-
ric (denoted as s) and non-stoichiometric (n) phases of A15 Nb3Pt. SEM images (Figs.
24(a)-(h)) reveal eutectic regions in all samples except AC. Elemental mapping indi-
cates that Pt and Zr are uniformly distributed throughout the matrix in the AN, SQ,
and SQA samples.
The critical temperatures of the AC, AN, SQ, and SQA samples are 8.1 K, 8.3 K,
7.8 K, and 5.6 K, respectively. A two-step superconducting transition is observed in
