Abstract
The unification of conformal and fuzzy gravities with internal interactions is based
on the facts that i) the tangent group of a curved manifold and the manifold itself do not
necessarily have the same dimensions and ii) both gravitational theories considered here
have been formulated in a gauge theoretic way. We review the gauge-theoretic approach
of gravities, commenting in particular on their diffeomorphism invariance, and the con-
struction of conformal and noncommutative (fuzzy) gravity using the gauge-theoretic
framework. Based on an extension of the four-dimensional tangent group, unification
of both gravities with the internal interactions is achieved. Both unified schemes are
examined at 1-loop level considering suitable spontaneous symmetry breakings to a
SO(10) grand unified theory and consequently down to the Standard Model of particle
physics through four specific spontaneous symmetry breaking channels. Each channel
is examined against proton lifetime experimental bounds and its observation potential
through gravitational signal from cosmic strings production is discussed.

Introduction
The Unification of all Interactions was an ultimate expectation of many theoretical physicists,
originating more than a century ago with the work of Kaluza and Klein [1, 2] by elaborating
the notion of extra dimensions. An extension of the original ideas of Kaluza and Klein, by
introducing multiple extra dimensions, produced a revival of the original scheme, when it
was realised [3–5], that the non-abelian gauge theories could be necessary ingredients for
