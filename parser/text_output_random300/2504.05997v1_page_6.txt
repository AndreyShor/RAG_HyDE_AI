DISCUSSION
This short note provides two simple proofs of the universality of IQP-QCBM when hidden (ancillary) qubits are used. This
provides additional motivation to study these models as generative modes in near-term quantum computing. We, however,
highlight that the purpose of this construction is theoretical, and should not be used as a suggestion to use large numbers of
hidden units in practice. Since we deal with exponential outcome spaces, universality requires dealing with exponentially many
trainable parameters, and in our construction, increasing the register size by a factor of 3. The latter in general would cause
a quicker decay of gradients, and the prior makes the setting immediately intractable. Furthermore, fully universal models are
often a bad idea as they likely lead to signiﬁcant overﬁtting1. This work does further clarify the role and potential of using more
complicated diagonal encoding operations, and additional hidden qubits as structural parameters which can be used to balance
expressivity, overﬁtting, and trainability.
