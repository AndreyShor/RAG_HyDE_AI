For a 6-dimensional membrane, we might set:
X5 = x1, X6 = x2.

And similarly, for 8 and 10 dimensions, more coordinates can be assigned in the
same manner. The extension to higher dimensions maintains the structure of
the non-commutative geometry by ensuring that the same commutation rela-
tions hold between the appropriate coordinate pairs. This method provides a
systematic way to construct higher-dimensional non-commutative branes within
the matrix model framework while preserving the symmetry and algebraic con-
sistency of the model.

Conclusion
In this study, a Lorentz covariant matrix model was obtained by partially re-
stricting the volume-preserving deformation (VPD) through gauge ﬁxing, result-
ing in a Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformation (RVPD) within the bosonic
part of the M2-brane action in 11-dimensional spacetime.
We demonstrated that the solutions to this matrix model include particle-
like solutions, two-dimensional non-commutative membranes, as well as higher-
dimensional non-commutative membranes with 4, 6, 8, and 10 dimensions.
These results suggest that the proposed matrix model is capable of describ-
ing a wide variety of extended objects within a consistent Lorentz-invariant
framework.

Discussion
To assess whether these solutions are stable, it is essential to incorporate super-
symmetry into the model. Supersymmetry could provide the necessary frame-
work to analyze stability and identify potential BPS states within the matrix
model.
Additionally, demonstrating the correspondence between this Lorentz co-
variant matrix model and conventional discussions of M2-branes, such as those
in the BFSS model or the BLG model, is crucial. Establishing such connections
would not only validate the proposed model but also facilitate comparisons with
established non-perturbative formulations of M-theory.
Since M5-branes can also be described using higher-order Nambu brackets,
extending the current analysis to M5-branes is a promising direction.
Such
an extension could potentially reveal new insights into the non-perturbative
structure of M-theory and oﬀer a uniﬁed approach to describing multiple types
of branes.
This study establishes a robust foundation for future investigations, in-
cluding the exploration of supersymmetry, model correspondences, and higher-
dimensional brane theories within the Lorentz covariant matrix model frame-
