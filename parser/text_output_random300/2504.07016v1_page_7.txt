The special solutions we use for v1 and v2 are provided by Hubeny in [35]. These solutions take
the form Φ(ϕ)Θ(θ), where:
Φ(ϕ) = linear combination of sin(mϕ) and cos(mϕ),
Θ(θ) = (1 + m cos θ)
1 −cos θ
1 + cos θ

,
with m ∈Z as a free parameter. By selecting specific values of m for v1 and v2, we solve for the
spherical harmonic coefficients up to order l = 4. Recovering coefficients for a general spherical
harmonic expansion by this method remains an open question, but we note that using Hubeny’s
solutions in (1.5) provides infinitely many conditions for the coefficients of the expansion.

Recovering f from A using inversion of δA
Finally, we address the reconstruction of not just the perturbation δf(z), but the entire metric
function f(z), under the assumption that f remains close to unity (|f(z) −1| ≪1). This recon-
struction is enabled by the explicit inversion formula (1.3) in dimension 3 and its higher-dimensional
generalizations (3.33) and (3.39).
The statement of the problem is the following: given the minimal surface area function r 7→
Af(r), associated with an unknown metric function f ≈1, we aim to reconstruct f(z) entirely from
the boundary data Af. The key insight is the first-order approximation
Af −Af=1 = δA + O(|f −1|2),
(1.6)
where δA is the linearized area variation induced by the perturbation δf = 1−f. Since Af −Af=1 is
known from boundary measurements, the inversion formula for δf yields a first-order approximation
of 1 −f(z) in terms of this observable difference.
While (1.6) captures the leading-order behavior, higher-order corrections O(|f −1|2) must
be incorporated for an accurate reconstruction. To achieve this, we propose an iterative scheme
inspired by the implicit function theorem:
1. Initialization: Begin with the trivial AdS metric f0(z) ≡1.
2. Iterative Update: At each step n, refine the estimate via
fn+1(z) = fn(z) −(DA|f=1)−1(Afn −Af),
(1.7)
where (DA|f=1)−1 is the inverse operator provided by our explicit linearized inversion formula
(1.3), Afn is the area data for minimal surfaces computed for fn, and Af is the given area
data.
3. Convergence: The iteration proceeds until fn converges, reconstructing the full nonlinear
metric f(z).
This method is particularly suited for low-temperature black hole metrics (1.4) (where zH ≫1),
as they remain perturbatively close to AdS. We discuss convergence criteria, numerical implemen-
tation, and broader implications in Section 5.

Bulk reconstruction
In this work, we investigate the problem of recovering bulk geometric deformations from correspond-
ing variations in boundary entanglement entropy. Specifically, we address the bulk reconstruction
problem at the linearized (perturbative) level, working to first order around a fixed background
