larger T cut values. By contrast, the NNLL′ + NNLO predictions do not show any noticeable
change due to π2 resummation with the uncertainty bands from both predictions being on
top of each other. Thus, for our highest-precision NNLL′ + NNLO predictions, the π2
resummation does not have a noticeable impact.

Conclusions
The Drell-Yan process, pp →Z/γ∗+X →l+l−+X, is a crucial standard candle process at
the LHC, and provides a clean testing ground for our understanding of perturbative QCD.
As such, precise predictions for this process with a variety of different measurements applied
to the accompanying QCD radiation are highly desirable. Here, we have obtained both
NLL′ + NLO and NNLL′ + NNLO predictions for the Drell-Yan cross section with a cut
on the rapidity-dependent jet veto observables TBj and TCj. The TB/Cj observables impose
a veto on the transverse momentum of the leading jet weighted by the rapidity of the jet,
such that the veto is tight at central rapidities and becomes looser at forward rapidities.
Such vetoes have a somewhat different resummation structure than the ‘standard’ pTj veto,
and they are convenient for use at the LHC, where missing tracking information at forward
rapidities makes it difficult to impose a tight veto in this region.
Initially we determined the uncertainty in the resummed predictions following the
procedure described in ref. [17], where that paper obtains similar predictions but in the
context of Higgs production.
We observed unsatisfactory behaviour in the uncertainty
bands, with the NLL′ + NLO band being smaller than the NNLL′ + NNLO band at very
small T cut values, and the bands not overlapping in this region. To establish the reasons
for this, we examined the resummation scale variations, where the relevant scales are the
soft scale µS and beam scale µB. We found that the uncertainty for the NLL′ + NLO
prediction in particular was being underestimated. The reasons behind this were two-fold:
first, there is an anomalously small response of the resummed cross section to variations
of the soft scale µS at NLL′, and second, there is a strong cancellation of the effect of
