2. For the purely fermionic part, one of the well-tested approaches is to incorporate the patch theory, introduced in
Refs. [1, 4–6, 8, 27].
The usefulness of using these coordinates lies in the fact that the itinerant fermions, in the
vicinity of a given point on the Fermi surface, primarily couple with the bosons whose momentum (q) is in a direction
perpendicular to the local Fermi momentum. Consequently, the fermions in different patches on the Fermi surface are
effectively decoupled from each other in the low-energy limit, except of course when they have antiparallel tangents.
It makes it possible to extract all the physical properties (e.g., Green’s functions) to be easily extracted from the
information contained in the local patches, without having to refer to the global properties of the Fermi surface. Using
the patch coordinates, the kinetic action for the fermionic excitations is captured by
Sf =
Z
k
ψ†(k) (−i k0 + δk) ψ(k) ,
δk = vF k⊥+
k2
∥
2 m ,
(2)
in the Fourier space. Here, ψ denotes the fermionic field residing on the patch under consideration. We have used
the condensed notations of k ≡(k0, k) (with k0 denoting the Matsubara frequency) and
R
k ≡
R dk0 dk∥dk⊥
(2 π)3
. While
writing the kinetic terms in the the patch coordinates, we have expanded the fermion momentum about the local Fermi
momentum, kF , such that k⊥is directed perpendicular to the local Fermi surface, and k∥is tangential to it.
3. The last bit comprises the coupling terms between the bosons and the fermions, which is captured by
Sint = ˜e
Z
k
Z
q
(cos kx −cos ky) ϕ(q) ψ†(k + q) ψ(k) ,
(3)
where ˜e is the fermion-boson coupling constant. We would like to point out that this piece of the total action is written
in the global momentum space coordinates (rather than the patch coordinates of the Fermi surface). Converting the
above to the patch coordinates, and keeping only the leading order terms in momentum about the Fermi surface, we
get (cos kx −cos ky) ≃cos kF . Re-expressing the coupling strength as e = ˜e cos kF , we then get the following form for
the fermion-boson interaction in the patch coordinates:
˜Sint = e
Z
k
Z
q
ϕ(q) ψ†(k + q) ψ(k) .
(4)
The penultimate step for obtaining the final form of the total action, Stot, involves as appropriate rescaling of the energy
and momenta, and dropping the irrelevant terms [4, 5] after determining the engineering dimension of each term. This is
implemented by setting [k0] = [k⊥] = 1 and [k∥] = 1/2. This finally leads to
Stot = Sf + ˜Sb + ˜Sint ,
˜Sb = 1

The patch coordinates enables us to extract the correct forms of the one-loop self-energies for the bosons and the fermions
[1, 4, 5], as described below:
1. From Stot, the bare Matusubara Green’s functions for the fermions and bosons are found to be
G(0)(k) =
1
i k0 −δk
and D(0)(q) =
1
−q2
||
,
(6)
respectively.
2. Since the bare kinetic term of the boson depends only on q||, we need to include the lowest-order quantum corrections to
ensure that the loop-integrals are infrared- and ultraviolet-finite [4, 5]. Since the one-loop bosonic self-energy evaluates
to Π(q) = −e2 R
k G(0)(k + q) G(0)(k) =
e2 m |q0|
2 π vF |q|||, we use the one-loop corrected bosonic propagator,
D(1)(q) =

in all our subsequent loop-calculations. We note that Π(q) takes a form which represents an overdamped harmonic
oscillator, thus earning it the nomenclature of Landau damping. The validity of this expression corresponds to the
limits of |q0|/|q∥| ≪1, |q| ≪kF , and |q| →0.
3. Using the dressed bosonic propagator (containing the all-important effects of Landau damping), the one-loop fermion
self-energy in the Matsubara space turns out to be
