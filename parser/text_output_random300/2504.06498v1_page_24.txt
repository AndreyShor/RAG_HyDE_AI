As discussed, the threshold external feedback gain (𝐺th
ext) required for maser oscillations to
spontaneously emerge corresponds to the inverse of the on-resonance internal gains:
𝐺th
ext =
1
𝐺int( 𝑓0) .
(S14)
For 1-𝐽and 2-𝐽transitions, this yields 𝐺th
ext ≈7.2 and 𝐺th
ext ≈5.8, respectively, consistent with the
results in Fig. 2E-2F.
The Normalization of Fourier Transformation
Suppose a continuous signal 𝑥(𝑡) is sampled at a rate 𝑓𝑠to get a discrete sequence
𝑥[𝑛] = 𝑥

𝑡= 𝑛
𝑓𝑠

,
𝑛= 0, 1, . . . , 𝑁−1,
(S15)
over a total duration 𝑇= 𝑁/ 𝑓𝑠. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is then calculated as,
𝑋[𝑘] =
𝑁−1
∑︁
𝑛=0
𝑥[𝑛] 𝑒−𝑗2𝜋𝑘
𝑁𝑛,
𝑘= 0, 1, . . . , 𝑁−1.
(S16)
Interpreting the sum as a Riemann approximation, i.e., Δ𝑡· Í(·) ≈
∫𝑇
0 (·) 𝑑𝑡, 𝑋[𝑘] approximates
the continuous Fourier integral,
𝑋[𝑘] ≈𝑓𝑠
∫𝑇
0
𝑥(𝑡) 𝑒−𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑘𝑡𝑑𝑡,
(S17)
with the discrete frequency 𝑓𝑘= 𝑘𝑓𝑠
𝑁and the sampling interval Δ𝑡= 1/ 𝑓𝑠.
Two different normalization conventions adopted:
Convention I:
Divide 𝑋[𝑘] by the number of samples 𝑁, giving,
e𝑋II[𝑘] = 𝑋[𝑘]
𝑁
≈1
𝑇
∫𝑇
0
𝑥(𝑡) 𝑒−𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑘𝑡𝑑𝑡.
(S18)
In this case, the Fourier amplitudes retain the original units of 𝑥(𝑡) (e.g., pT). This convention was
adopted in Fig. 3.
Convention II:
Multiply 𝑋[𝑘] by Δ𝑡= 1/ 𝑓𝑠, so that,
e𝑋I[𝑘] = 𝑋[𝑘]
𝑓𝑠
≈
∫𝑇
0
𝑥(𝑡) 𝑒−𝑗2𝜋𝑓𝑘𝑡𝑑𝑡.
(S19)
This yields Fourier amplitudes with units such as pT/Hz (if 𝑥(𝑡) is measured in pT). This convention
was adopted in Fig. 1
