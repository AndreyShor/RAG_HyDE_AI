Dual quasar fraction as a function of redshift.
The blue data points represent the double quasar fraction
from this work, compared with previous observational stud-
ies, including Silverman et al. (2020) (gray) and Shen et al.
(2023a) (red). Dual quasar fractions in this work and (Shen
et al. 2023a) are corrected for the lensed quasar fraction,
while that in Silverman et al. (2020) are account for the
spectroscopic confirmation rate and incompleteness at small
separations (Silverman et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2021). For
comparison, fractions from 4 simulations constrained by the
same observational criteria as Silverman et al. (2020) are
also displayed here, including Illustris (purple), TNG100 (or-
ange), TNG300 (pink), and HAGN (green), with fractions
derived by Puerto-S´anchez et al. (2025). The error bars or
shaded regions indicate the Poisson uncertainties for each
dataset.
and lower redshifts, allowing us to examine the redshift
evolution of the pair fraction with a nearly doubled sam-
ple size. We present the catalog of the full pair sample
(Table 2) for future follow-up studies.
With the final sample, we measure an overall double
quasar fraction of approximately 5.7+0.3
−0.3 × 10−4 within
0.′′3–3′′ separations over 0.5 < z ≲4.5, after correct-
ing for pair-resolving completeness by Gaia (see Section
2.4). We find no strong redshift evolution in the dual
quasar fraction over this broad redshift range. When
divided at z = 1.5, the low-redshift subset (⟨z⟩= 1.0)
and the high-redshift subset (⟨z⟩= 2.0) exhibit similar
double quasar fractions, measured as 4.9+0.2
−0.2 ×10−4 and
6.2+0.5
−0.5 × 10−4, respectively.
We compare our results with previous observational
studies (Silverman et al. 2020; Shen et al. 2023a) and
numerical simulations (e.g., Puerto-S´anchez et al. 2025)
that focus on luminous dual quasars, and find general
agreements. However, while the redshift evolution of the
dual quasar fraction is generally weak in both observa-
tions and simulations, the overall dual quasar fraction in
simulations is higher than the observed values. This dis-
crepancy is likely caused by the fact that current obser-
vational searches for luminous dual quasars are largely
limited to the unobscured population, missing a large
fraction of dual systems where at least one quasar is
obscured.
The combination of two wide-area sky surveys, the
SDSS and Gaia, offers one of the most efficient methods
to identify luminous dual and lensed quasars at small
separations. However, even with precise Gaia astromet-
ric measurements to eliminate a large body of star super-
positions, the confirmation of dual versus lensed quasars
remains challenging, requiring dedicated, follow-up ob-
servations (e.g., Chen et al. 2022).
Most of the cur-
rent dual quasar searches also exclude obscured systems,
complicating a direct comparison with simulation pre-
dictions. Fortunately, upcoming wide-area space-based
surveys such as Euclid (Euclid Collaboration et al. 2024)
and Roman (Spergel et al. 2015) that target both ob-
scured and unobscured AGNs at sub-arcsec resolution
and extend to much fainter AGN luminosities, will be-
come a powerhouse in discovering and characterizing
the dual AGN population across cosmic history (Shen
et al. 2023b). These future dual AGN samples will have
greatly improved statistics and host characterization,
and are much better matched to simulation predictions
to study the evolution of the dual SMBH population.
