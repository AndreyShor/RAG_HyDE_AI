4.2.1
Decomposition across annuli
We begin by defining the following sets
A0
def= B1
and
Aj
def= Bj+1 \ Bj,
∀j ∈N .
With this notation in place, for all b ∈N ∪{∞} and x ∈Bb, the field Φb in (4.1) can be conveniently
rewritten as follows
Φb(x) = −
Z b
0
(1 −K(e−sx))dBs +
b−1
X
j=0
Zj(x)1{x∈Aj} +
b−1
X
j=0
Zj,b(x)1{x∈Aj} ,
(4.5)
where the fields Zj and Zj,b are as in Definition 3.9. For every b ∈N ∪{∞} and j ∈[b −1]0, we
aim to control the tails of the suprema of the fields Zj and Zj,b over Aj. This will be the content of
the next two lemmas.
4.2.2
Controlling the tails
Recall the definition (2.1) of the recentering constants mj.
Lemma 4.3. There exists a constant c > 0 such that for all j ∈N, it holds that
P
 sup
x∈Aj
Zj(x) −mj
 ≥η

≲e−cη ,
∀η ≥0 .
Proof. For j ∈N and η ≥0, the probability in the lemma statement is equivalent to
P

sup
x∈B1\B0
Zj(ejx) −mj
 ≥η

.
(4.6)
On the other hand, since by (K2) the seed covariance function K is supported in B(0, 1), we have that
for all x, y ∈B1 \ B0, it holds that
E[Zj(ejx)Zj(ejy)] =
Z j
0
K(es(x −y))ds .
In other words, the field Zj(ej·) restricted to the annulus B1 \ B0 has the same law as the martingale
approximation at level j of a ⋆-scale invariant field with seed covariance kernel K. Hence, if the
annulus B1 \ B0 in (4.6) is replaced by the d-dimensional unit box [0, 1]d, then this tightness
result is well-known, see e.g. [DRSV14a,Mad15,Aco14]. To deduce the tightness of supremum of
(Zj(ej·))j∈N over the annulus B1 \ B0 from the one over the box [0, 1]d, one can simply note that
B1 \ B0 contains and is contained in a box of order one.
Regarding the field Zj,b, we have the following bound on its supremum over annuli of radii smaller
than j.
Lemma 4.4. There exists a constant c > 0 such that for b ∈N ∪{∞}, j ∈[b −1]0, and l ∈[j]0, it
holds that
P

sup
x∈Al
Zj,b(x) ≥η

≲e−ce2(j−l)η2 ,
∀η ≥0 .
Proof. The result follows by a standard application of Fernique’s majorizing criterion (Lemma C.3)
and Borell-TIS inequality (Lemma C.2). We only detail the case b = ∞, as the case b ∈N is
completely analogous. Fix j ∈N and l ∈[j] and note that the probability in the statement equals
P

sup
x∈B1\B0
Zj,∞(elx) ≥η

.
