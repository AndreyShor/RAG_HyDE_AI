THE AMPLITUDE OF THE PROCESS τ →ππηντ
The diagrams of the process τ →ππηντ are given in Figs. 1, 2.
The amplitude of this process in the NJL model takes the following form:
M = 8GFVudm

Mcρ + Mρρ + Mcˆρ + Mρ ˆρ + M ˆρρ + M ˆρ ˆρ
+Mcb + Mρb + M ˆρb

where GF is the Fermi constant, Vud is the element of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix, Lµ is the weak
lepton current, pη, pπ−and pπ0 are the momenta of the ﬁnal mesons.
The terms Mρρ, Mρ ˆρ, M ˆρρ and M ˆρ ˆρ describe the contributions from the diagrams with the intermediate ρ
mesons in the ground and ﬁrst radially excited states. The ﬁrst and second indices refer to the ﬁrst and second
intermediate states. The index b denotes a box diagram. The index c denotes the contact contribution. These
