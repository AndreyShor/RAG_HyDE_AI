1. Introduction
In the context of anthropogenic climate change, the response of the atmospheric circulation to
radiative forcing is often seen as a second-order effect, even if it is widely acknowledged that it can
have large consequences localized in time and space, for instance for regional climate and extreme
events (Cohen et al. 2014; Shepherd 2014; Vautard et al. 2023, e.g.). In principle, it is possible
that in a warmer climate a major reorganization of the large-scale circulation would drive further
global changes, either through positive feedbacks acting uniformly in space or by changing the
energy balance of large portions of the globe.
While fundamental balance relations enforce strong constraints on the large-scale mid-latitude
circulation, dramatic changes are not a priori excluded for the tropical circulation, and it has
been suggested that major surprises might occur there, potentially through coupling with the
ocean (Pierrehumbert 2000). While current projections do exhibit changes for instance in the
extent of the Hadley cell (Seidel et al. 2008), the intertropical convergence zone (Byrne et al.
2018), and a general weakening of the overturning circulation (Merlis 2015; Chemke and Yuval
2023), they do not foresee major changes in the structure of the circulation. On the other hand,
the emergence of equatorial superrotation – the reversal of Earth’s climatological easterly winds
in the tropics (Held 1999) – would constitute a fundamental change in the atmospheric general
circulation. Superrotation has long been studied by atmospheric dynamicists and modelers (Suarez
and Duffy 1992; Saravanan 1993; Held 1999), but has attracted renewed interest in recent years
partly because of its relevance for planetary atmospheres (Read and Lebonnois 2018; Imamura et al.
2020). The suggestion that equatorial superrotation might have occurred during warm climates of
Earth’s past, such as those of the Pliocene (Tziperman and Farrell 2009), Early Eocene (Caballero
and Huber 2010), or even deeper in time in the Mesozoic (Lan et al. 2023), has further motivated
study of this atmospheric phenomenon.
Until now, the focus of superrotation research has been on the dynamical processes sustain-
ing equatorial westerlies, as this requires non-trivial anti-diffusive angular momentum transport
mechanisms (Held 1999). Several routes have been suggested, all involving momentum transport
by equatorial waves, either through enhanced diabatic heating (Kraucunas and Hartmann 2005;
Arnold et al. 2012; Lutsko 2018) or through a hydrodynamic instability (Williams 2003; Mitchell
and Vallis 2010; Potter et al. 2014; Zurita-Gotor and Held 2018; Zurita-Gotor et al. 2022; Zurita-
