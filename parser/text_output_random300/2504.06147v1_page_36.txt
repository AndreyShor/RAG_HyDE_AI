Figure 2: Here the dashed circle contains the region of convergence for the Frobenius solutions
ϖ(H) expanded about ϕ = 0. Each X is a singularity in the ϕ-plane, which we encircle with the
red contours to compute the monodromy matrices (3.49). To compute n(H)
∞
we continue along the
green curve in the lower-right ϕ-quadrant to ϕ = −i∞, which we then encircle counter-clockwise
(not pictured) before returning along the green curve.

Let us remark that we could also have chosen the (3, 3)-entry in (3.48) to be 1 or −1/3 (instead
of the value of 1/3 that we use), if we were only concerned with obtaining integral monodromies.
However, note the following justification for choosing 1/3.
We find a transfer matrix Tupper, so that
Π(H)(ϕ) =
1
i39/2 TupperΠ(LV )(φ(ϕ)),
(3.50)
where we analytically continue along an integration contour in the upper-right quadrant in φ-space.
This path is obtained by concatenating the green curves displayed in both Figure 1 and Figure 2.
With our choice of D as in (3.48), we get
Tupper =

with determinant equalling 1. This is in agreement with the value we found for η in (3.13), namely
η2 = −39. So our results (3.41) and (3.50) are consistent, see our discussion surrounding (3.19).
With the exception of ϕ =

The reason that this fails for ϕ =

3 has to do with our choices of integration contour. If we
instead continue along the lower-right quadrant in φ-space, we obtain
