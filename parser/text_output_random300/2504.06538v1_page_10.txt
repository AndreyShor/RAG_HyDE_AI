• The topological constraints provide the largest per-
formance improvement (9.0% absolute increase in
average ATP), with particularly pronounced ef-
fects on complex manipulation tasks (Bussing Hard
+10%).
• The hierarchical action representation significantly
improves performance on multi-stage tasks (Bussing
Hard +16%), but provides minimal benefit for sim-
pler tasks like Box Building (+6%).
• The Runge-Kutta integration technique offers a mod-
est performance gain (2.2% average ATP) while sub-
stantially improving computational efficiency.

Robustness Analysis
To evaluate model robustness, we tested performance un-
der three perturbation conditions:
1. Visual perturbations: Varying lighting conditions
and adding visual noise (±20% brightness, Gaussian
noise σ = 0.1)
2. Linguistic variations:
Paraphrasing task instruc-
tions while preserving semantic content
3. Object perturbations: Slight alterations to object
positions and orientations (±2cm, ±10)
OPAL maintains 92% of its original performance under
visual perturbations, 95% under linguistic variations, and
88% under object perturbations. In comparison, π0 re-
tains only 78%, 89%, and 73% respectively, while both
Octo and OpenVLA show performance degradation ex-
ceeding 50% under all perturbation types.
This enhanced robustness can be attributed to the topolog-
ical constraints, which enforce physical consistency even
when input conditions vary. The theoretical guarantees
provided by our framework translate to practical advan-
tages in real-world deployment scenarios where perturba-
tions are inevitable.

Discussion
8.1
Topological Structure in Action Space
Our results demonstrate that imposing topological con-
straints on the action space leads to more coherent and
physically plausible action sequences. The string-net for-
malism provides a natural framework for representing ac-
tion sequences with internal topological constraints. Just
as string-nets encode quantum states through networks of
labeled strings following local fusion rules, our action rep-
resentation encodes motion primitives through hierarchi-
cal structures following learned compositional rules.
8.2
Long-Term Coherence Through Topo-
logical Constraints
Our approach achieves significantly more coherent long-
term action sequences through several mathematically
formalizable mechanisms. The primary mechanism is the
structural inductive bias encoded in the topological atten-
tion framework. By encoding physical constraints directly
into the attention mechanism, we fundamentally restrict
the model’s search space to physically plausible trajecto-
ries. This approach differs fundamentally from previous
methods that attempt to learn physical constraints implic-
itly from data, which often fail to generalize to novel sit-
uations due to the absence of explicit structural guidance.
Invariant maintenance constitutes a second key mecha-
nism. Topological field theories are characterized math-
ematically by their ability to maintain invariants under
continuous deformations. Analogously, our topological
attention mechanism ensures that key physical invariants,
including object relations and physical feasibility, are pre-
served throughout the action sequence, even as individual
actions vary. This preservation can be formally expressed
as:
(23)
I(Aτ1
t ) = I(Aτ2
t )
∀τ1, τ2
∈[0, 1]
where I represents an invariant measure on the action
space. The maintenance of these invariants is a direct con-
sequence of the topological structure imposed by Mtopo.
The hierarchical representation of actions as primitives
P k
t enables multi-scale consistency in the generated se-
quences. This consistency manifests at three scales: lo-
cal consistency within each primitive (such as a complete
grasp sequence), inter-primitive consistency between ad-
jacent primitives (such as transitions from grasping to lift-
ing), and global plan consistency across the entire action
horizon (maintaining overall task structure). The mathe-
matical formalism of our approach guarantees consistency
at each of these scales through the hierarchical application
of fusion rules and consistency conditions.
Our approach provides formal action coherence guaran-
tees. Specifically, we can prove that:
(24)
Dphys(At, P) ≤ϵ
where Dphys denotes a distance metric in the space of
physical trajectories, P represents the manifold of phys-
ically valid trajectories, and ϵ constitutes a bound that
decreases as model capacity increases.
The proof fol-
lows from the properties of the topological constraints
encoded in Mtopo and the projection operations applied
during training and inference. This formal guarantee pro-
vides a theoretical foundation for the empirical improve-
ments observed in our experimental results.
