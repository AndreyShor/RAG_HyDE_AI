Dirac field in Schwarzschild spacetime
There may exist a diverse variety of fields on M that describe the matter content of the spacetime, adhering to either
tensorial or spinor equations, and are defined using the metric g on M. For example, we can have electromagnetic,
neutrino, electron, Higgs, or pion field. Metrics other than g or other connections can also be understood as other
physical fields. Spinors and spinorial tensor fields arise as realizations of the representation of ISL(2,C). However, one
can define the spinor fields only if the spacetime manifold satisfies certain topological properties [45].
Spinor fields
are acknowledged as the predominant component in Hawking radiation [46; 47; 48]. They have also found application
in explaining the acceleration of the universe [49; 50; 51]. Therefore, the matter field we consider in the Schwarzschild
spacetime is the Dirac spinor, which comprises four components. One can understand it as the combination of an SL(2,C)
spinor and its complex conjugate SL(2,C) spinor counterpart. The action describing the Dirac field is given by
A =
Z
d4x
p
−g(x){1
2i[ ¯ψ¯γµ∇µψ −(∇µ ¯ψ)¯γµψ] −m ¯ψψ},
(5)
where ∇represents the spinor covariant derivative. One can get the following Dirac equations by varying the above
action, denoted by Eq.(5) with respect to ¯ψ and ψ, respectively:
(i¯γµ∇µ −m)ψ = 0,
(6)
i∇µ ¯ψ¯γµ + m ¯ψ = 0.
In n-dimensional spacetime, the above Eqs.(5-6) exhibit conformal invariance in the massless limit as long as ψ →
Ω(1−n)/2(x)ψ under conformal transformation of the metric, gµν(x) →Ω2(x)gµν(x). Under the combined local Lorentz
and general coordinate transformations on Eq.(5), by imposing the requirement of general covariance of the Dirac
equations, Eq.(6), one obtains a condition that is identical to the requirement of covariance under Lorentz transformations
in flat spacetime. The key distinction is that in this context, the transformations are local [52] while analyzing quantum
entanglement one has to look for nonlocal correlations. Solutions of the Dirac equation form a complete and orthonormal
set of modes that can be quantized by imposing anticommutation relations on the field because quantizing the Dirac
field using commutators leads to issues with causality and the energy not being bounded from below [52].
The Schwarzschild metric depends upon the radial coordinate, ‘r’, which becomes timelike inside the horizon at
r = Rs = 2GM. Furthermore, the Schwarzschild spacetime exhibits time-reversal symmetry; however, the quantum
state imposed on it need not share the same time-reversal symmetry. However, even with the time dependence of the
interior region of the Schwarzschild solution, it is possible to define a globally stable vacuum state [53]. Since the manifold
is time-oriented, one can also define the Feynman propagator, which sandwiches time-ordered quantum fields between
the state, as follows:
iSF
αβ(x, x′) = ⟨0|T(ψα(x) ¯ψβ(x′))|0⟩= θ(t −t′)S+
αβ(x, x′) −θ(t′ −t)S−
αβ(x, x′),
(7)
where S+
αβ and S−
αβ are known as Wightman bi -distributions. The Wightman bi-distributions have a Dirac delta form for
null-separated events 1. However, due to relativistic causality, since the Dirac field anticommutes for spacelike-separated
events, the time-ordered product does not exhibit any discontinuity when x0 = x′
0. The Feynman propagator for the
spin half field satisfies
[iγµ(x)∇x
µ −m]SF (x, x′) = [−g(x)]−1/2δn(x −x′).
(8)
It can be seen by direct substitution that
SF (x, x′) = [iγµ(x)∇x
µ + m]Gϕ(x, x′),
(9)
where Gϕ(x, x′) is a bispinor satisfying Klein-Gordon equation in curved space-time with a nonminimal coupling [54]. It
can be verified using the identity shown in Eq.(3.232) of [52]. In the subsequent sections, we will work with a spacetime
1The Wightman bi-distribution gives well-defined results when one integrates over appropriate regions with well-defined boundary conditions.
Therefore, we use the term Wightman function in the rest of the paper.
