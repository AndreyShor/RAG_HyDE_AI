1.3 No-scale models from higher dimensions
13
This last result is somewhat disappointing, but as we will discuss later it
cannot be considered to be the end of the story.
In the case of N = 1 no-scale models, it is useful to elaborate more on
StrM2, the coefficient of the one-loop quadratically divergent contributions
to the vacuum energy. Assuming for simplicity pure F-breaking, we can write
in general [36]
Str M2(z, z) = 2 Q(z, z) m2
3/2(z, z) ,
(1.27)
where
Q(z, z) = NT −1 −Gi(z, z)

Rik(z, z) + Fik(z, z)

Gk(z, z)
(1.28)
Rik(z, z) ≡∂i∂k log det Gmn(z, z) ,
(1.29)
Fik(z, z) ≡−∂i∂k log det Re [fab(z)] .
(1.30)
In eq. (1.29), Rik is the Ricci tensor constructed from the metric of the Käh-
ler manifold for the NT chiral multiplets, and Fik has a similar geometrical
interpretation in terms of the metric for the gauge superfields. It is important
to observe that both Rik and Fik do not depend at all on the superpotential
of the theory. This very fact allows for the possibility that, for special geo-
metrical properties of these two metrics, the dimensionless quantity Q(z, z)
may turn out to be field-independent. In the models considered at the end
of section 1.2.2, for example [14]
Q =
X
A
(1 + λA) nA −n −λfdf −1 ,
(1.31)
where df is the dimension of the gauge group. Requiring Q = 0 is too strong
a constraint, since the ultraviolet completion of the model, where the cutoff Λ
is to be replaced by some heavy mass scale, may induce contributions to V1 of
the same order, coming from heavier states whose supersymmetry-breaking
mass splittings are also controlled by m3/2. However, the field-independence
of Q leaves the door open for a possible cancellation in the full theory.
1.3 No-scale models from higher dimensions
1.3.1 Dimensional reductions and consistent truncations
A deeper understanding of d = 4 no-scale supergravity can be gained by
looking at those models that can be linked with supergravity or superstring
theories formulated in d > 4 dimensions. For a long time, the only available
examples were the generalised dimensional reductions of d > 4 supergravi-
ties, introduced in [33, 40] and reviewed by John Schwarz in this volume [41],
