the 3D cylinder case. It is important to note that this dataset represents a transient flow
solution, meaning that some of the modes correspond to decaying transient behavior. If
too many modes are included, the reconstruction may incorporate errors related to these
transient decaying modes. Therefore, selecting a moderate number of modes is essential
to balance accuracy while avoiding the inclusion of unnecessary transient noise.
For the case of the experimental turbulent cylinder, selecting 4-6 modes is sufficient
to capture the dominant flow structures. The magnitude of the singular values for these
modes is ≥10−2, meaning that reconstruction errors in the range of 5-20% are expec-
ted. Additionally, experimental measurement uncertainties are at least 5%, indicating
that including modes with smaller singular value amplitudes would introduce unneces-
sary measurement noise into the reconstruction. The evolution of the first ten modes for
this dataset has been presented in Appendix A2.

Comparison of Temporal Predictions with Ground Truth
In this subsection, the results of the predictive models have been presented, comparing
the predicted snapshots against the ground truth data. The ensuing figures demonstrate
the proficiency of the integrated approach, employing HOSVD alongside robust deep
learning frameworks, in capturing the intricate dynamics of fluid flows.
