Heuristic justiﬁcation for Theorem 3
Suppose that for some ﬁxed time s > 0 and constant C > 0 (independent of x), the following
asymptotic relation holds, for all x > log ǫ,

Taking this as given, we obtain the conclusion of Theorem 3 at time s. We now argue that
if (20) holds for small s > 0, then it must also hold at time s = 0, by virtue of the dynamics
of the process Xτ.
By the Markov property, for any τ > s and x > log ǫ:
P(Xτ ̸= −∞| X0 = x) = E

(21)
Over the short interval [0, s], the process evolves as
Xs = x −µs + σWs,
where Ws ∼N (0, s),
because for x−log ǫ ≫
√
σ2s the probability of hitting the barrier before time s is negligible.
More precisely, this probability decays like exp

Thus, for such x, we may
approximate
1{Xs>log ǫ} ≈1 with high probability.
Substituting (20) into (21), and using the moment generating function E[exp(yWs)] =
exp(y2s/2) with y = µ/σ, we obtain:

This conﬁrms that (20) also holds at time 0. The key insight is that the exponential form
exp(µx/σ2) is preserved under Brownian motion with drift, and that the moment generating
