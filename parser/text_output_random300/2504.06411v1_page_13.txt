Since the Stratonovich integral commutes with time changes we have Ξ(ΓAt) = Ξ(Γ)At for any continuous time
change t 7→At. Then, given a (K, T)-deformation of Γ, we have

Remark 4.2. If X0 = t then the second equation is the Legendre transform pt = ∂L
∂vt . Also note that if Xi = 0 for
all i = 1, · · · , k then the stochastic implicit Euler-Lagrange equations reduce to the deterministic Euler-Lagrange
equations.

The Intrinsic Form of the Stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin Principle
We will now focus on the intrinsic form on the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle.
We introduce an
additional assumption here, namely that our semimartingales are obtained as solutions of Stratonovich equations
on manifolds. To motivate this, we recall that in case of the deterministic Hamilton’s principle, given a regular
Lagrangian L ∈C∞(TQ) there exists a second order vector field ZL such that the integral curves of ZL project
to solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations (see Theorem 7.3.3 in Marsden and Ratiu [11]). Thus, for regular
Lagrangians, finding a critical point of the action functional corresponds to selecting a particular vector field in
X (TQ). We will extend this idea to the stochastic case as well, namely, we will show that under the assumption
that a semimartingale solves a Stratonovich equation, finding a critical point of SX corresponds to selecting a
particular Stratonovich operator.
Let (e0, · · · , ek) be a basis of Rk+1. Let M be any regular submanifold of PQ and PrT M, PrM, etc. denote
the maps in (6) restricted to M. Given any Stratonovich operator S ∈Strat(Rk+1, M), any semimartingale
X = (X0, · · · , Xk) in Rk+1 and a solution ΓX of ◦dΓ = S(X, Γ) ◦dX, from Eq. (8) we have
SX(ΓX) =

Ej(ΓX) ◦dXj.
Given x ∈Rk+1, y ∈M and j ∈{0, · · · , k}, suppose zj ∈TTM, PrT M = Sx,ej(y) and TPrM = wy, for some
wy ∈TM. Then
dEj(wy) = dEj ◦TPrM(zj) = (PrM)∗dEj(Sx,ej)(zj).
Now let ϵ 7→ΓXϵ be any deformation of ΓX and Zj be any TTM-valued semimartingale such that TPrM(Zj) =
δΓX and PrT M(Zj) = Sx,ej(ΓX). Then
dEj(δΓX) = (PrM)∗dEj(SX,ej(ΓX))(Zj)
