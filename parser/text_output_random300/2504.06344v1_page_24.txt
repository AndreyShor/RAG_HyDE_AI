holonomies and commuting with the transition functions. Thus, the total number of bosonic
moduli—the holonomies ϕ[C′]r
µ
and the remaining components of CA
2 , CA
4 —for k ̸= r > 1 is 4r,
as required by the index theorem for a selfdual solution.
Two remarks are now due.
First, as we already mentioned, the above argument, using the results of ref. [1], is quite
general, as it holds for any N and any r with gcd(k, r) ̸= r. However, it is not trivially
extended to higher orders in λ.23
Thus, in section 4.4, we give an argument for SU(2)
which—at least in principle—is exact, but is only valid for N = 2 and any r > 1.24
Second, we test, further below in section 4.3, the leading-order λ-expansion (which is
only valid for small values of the coefficients CA
2,4, A = 1, ...r appearing in (4.1) and obeying
(4.3)) for the almost-constant F configurations we find numerically (in the section below) for
N = 3, r = 2, k = 1.

Results for numerical fractional instantons with gcd(k, r) ̸= r
Here we present a result of our numerical study of fractional instantons for SU(3) with Q = 2
3
with r = 2, k = 1. On Figures 5 and 6 we present the numerical results for the action density
profiles for fractional instantons of charge 2/3 and gcd(k, r) ̸= r, on the tuned T4, for two
different lattices with ∆(2, 1, 2) = 0, i.e. with 4L3L4 = L1L2 (recalling eqn. (1.3)). The
lattice on Figure 6 is twice as large (than the one on Figure 5) in all directions. Starting from
a random configuration, as described in Appendix C, in each case we find that the action
profile is non-constant, consistent with the argument that the constant-F instantons with
gcd(k, r) ̸= r are a measure-zero set.
As a further evidence that the non-constant-F lattice configurations we generated with
r = 2, k = 1 and ∆(2, 1, 2) = 0 span the entire moduli space, we show two plots with results
regarding the Wilson loop expectation value in these configurations. As shown in [27] from
considerations of the Hamiltonian interpretation of the T4 partition function with twists, the
value of the Wilson loop winding in any direction should vanish when integrated over the
moduli space of the multi-fractional instantons. We test this on Figure 7 by showing the
values of the real and imaginary parts of the Wilson loops (taken at the origin) for all 214
configurations generated. The numerical sum of the Wilson loops over all configurations is
shown by a cross, a value consistent with zero in each of the four directions (as required by
the Hamiltonian interpretation of the twisted partition function [27]).
A more systematic study of the average value of the Wilson loops calculated at every
point on the lattice is depicted in Figure 8, where we display the histogram of the averaged
Wilson loops over all configurations, for 214 configurations on a lattice of size (32, 8, 8, 8),
corresponding to ∆(2, 1, 2) = 0. In particular, we display the histogram of the absolute value
23The difficulty, compared to other studies of the “λ-expansion,” in the physics (e.g. [50, 51]) or mathematics
(e.g. [52]) literature, stems from the non-invertibility of the ¯∂∂operator.
24We believe that it should be possible to extend the argument of section 4.4 to any N and r, but leave this
for the future.
