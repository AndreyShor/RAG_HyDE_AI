one can plot the curves y1 = E and y2 = Veff(r) and see easily the nature of the roots of
f(u) = 0 depending upon when △4(f) < 0 for which we have a pair of real roots and
a complex conjugate pair and when △4(f) > 0, when either all four roots of f(u) = 0
are real or none is. This is the key to finding the polar equation of our orbits in terms
of elliptic integrals of Legendre. Recall that
△4 = (g3

gives a horrendous expression impossible to analyse directly. However, using the above
graphical approach involving the curves y1 and y2, we can establish the roots of our
quartic f(u) = 0 in terms of a parameter λ, a positive root of a cubic equation. We call
this our λ-analysis.
3.2. λ-Analysis
For B ̸= 0 the quartic equation f(u) = 0 reads
−u4 + 2C
B u3 −C2
B2u2 + 2µ
B2u + 2E
B2 = 0.
Reducing this to the depressed quartic and then completing the square in quartic and
quadratic terms allows us to write down the four roots as
u = 1

where λ is a positive real solution of the cubic equation

B3(µC + 2BE)λ −4µ2
B4 = 0.
We note that for µB−2 real, λ > 0 always exists.
For the values of E which correspond to the extrema of Veff(r) it is possible to calculate
the value of λ and hence determine the range(s) of λ corresponding to all four roots of
our original quartic as well as determine the nature of these roots.
3.3. Graphical Analysis for small |B|
Firstly, in general, we note that E < 0 guarantees that the real roots of, f(u) = 0, have
to be positive because µ > 0. Now considering the cubic equation, V ′
