Figure 5: Linear relative refractive index as a function of photon energy for different polar
substrates: h-BN, SiC, SiO2, and HfO2. (a) Without electric field (F = 0); (b) with in-plane
electric field (F = 0.3 V/nm).
fields indicates enhanced polaron confinement, which modifies the group velocity of the trans-
mitted light. Moreover, a substrate-dependent shift in the position of the resonance peaks is
observed. Substrates such as SiO2 and SiC, which possess favorable combinations of η and
ℏωSO, display the most significant peak shifts, indicating a stronger interaction between the
graphene carriers and substrate phonons. In contrast, HfO2 shows less pronounced spectral
displacement, consistent with its low phonon energy, which limits the influence of the polaron
effect on the refractive response.
When the in-plane electric field is applied (F = 0.35(b), the overall structure of the
linear relative refractive index remains qualitatively similar to the zero-field case. However,
the resonance peaks undergo noticeable spectral shifts, especially for substrates with strong
electron-phonon coupling. This behavior confirms that while the electric field has limited
influence on the amplitude of the refractive index modulation, it plays a key role in altering
the energy position of the resonant response. This shift arises from the field-induced en-
