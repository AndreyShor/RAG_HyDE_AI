The mean-ﬁeld approximation employed in the main
text corresponds to the semiclassical approximation in
the path integral by assuming bnη(τ) = rη + δbnη(τ) and
λn,η(τ) = λη + δλnη(τ), with (rη, λη) being the uniform
stationary point of the eﬀective action

Seff|δqnα(τ)=0 = 0.
(D7)
In the above, qα’s ( with α
=
1, 2, 3, 4) represent
the four mean ﬁeld parameters (rA, rB, λA, λB), the
manifold of the stationary solution, and δqnα(τ)
=
(δbnA(τ), δbnB(τ), δλnA(τ), δλnB(τ)) the respective de-
viations or quantum ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld variables
from their stationary solution. For simplicity, the depen-
dence of the eﬀective action on qα will be emphasized.
The eﬀective action can be then expanded around the
stationary point

With these considerations, the partition function can
be given by

Neglecting the quantum ﬂuctuations, one obtains the
partition function at the mean-ﬁeld level
Z(0) =

D[¯cnησcnησ ¯dnησdnησ]e−S(0)
eff[qα]. (D10)
Expanding the ﬁeld variables in the frequency repre-
sentation and diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in
S(0)
eff[qα] in the momentum space using a unitary transfor-
mation ˆU: (ckησn, dkησn) →ψkmσn, with m = 1, 2, 3, 4
being the band index and k the momentum quantum
number valued in the hexagonal BZ, one obtains the sta-
tionary action
S(0)
eff[qα] =

where ωn = (2n + 1)πT are the Matsubara frequencies
for n ∈Z, Ekmσ the eigenvalues depending on the mean
ﬁeld parameters qα, as well as for EC = L P

with L being the total number of unit cells. Then, we
can perform the path integral arriving at
Z(0) = e−βEC Y
kmσn
β[−iωn + Ekmσ].
(D12)
Taking the logarithm of this expression and then the
summation over the Matsubara frequencies we obtain the
mean-ﬁeld free energy F ≡−kBT ln Z(0) as

Our numerical solutions of the mean-ﬁeld parameters
qα = (rA, rB, λA, λB) in the four-band Hamiltonian show
the existence of the SKS phase where rA = 0 but rB > 0
in a wide range of the original model parameters. At the
mean-ﬁeld level, such phase is equivalent to the Kondo
phase in the three-band Hamiltonian in the A-B stack
pattern if the intralayer f electron hopping and the in-
terlayer long-range hybridizations are neglected. In the
latter situation, we have
ˆH[ˆcA, ˆcB, ˆfA, ˆfB] = ˆH[ˆcA, ˆcB, ˆfB] + ˆH[ ˆfA],
(D14)
implying the complete decoupling of the A-sublattice f
electrons from the bath. In this case, ˆH[ˆcA, ˆcB, ˆfB] is a
three-band model without involving the A-sublattice f
electrons. So the eigenvalue of the decoupled ˆH[ ˆfA] part
remains at the bare local level E0 well-bellow the Fermi
energy without double occupation due to the strong f
electron interaction U.
Interestingly, there is a silent discrepancy between the
four and three-band model Hamiltonians: in the numer-
ical solutions of the four-band Hamiltonian in the A-B
stacking pattern, the band energy of the A sublattice
f electrons is exactly ﬂat but closes to the Fermi en-
ergy when rA →0+, in contrast to the bare level E0
