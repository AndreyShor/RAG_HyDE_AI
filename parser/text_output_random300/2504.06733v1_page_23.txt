3 Ionic vs excitonic: Ar 2p XPS-XAS comparison
Fig.S2 shows the Ar 2p3/2 ‚Üí4s X-ray absorption resonance in relation to the Ar
2p (L2,3) spectrum acquired over a wider photon energy range. Wurth et al.[4] have
previously identified the origin of the higher lying resonances. In the inset to Fig.S2
we show a comparison of the Ar 2p core-level and 2p3/2 ‚Üí4s X-ray absorption
spectra, plotted on the same energy scale. (The binding energy (BE) of the core-level
spectrum is referenced to the Fermi level.) There is a difference of 2.7 ¬± 0.1 eV
between the Ar 2p3/2 core level BE and the peak energy of the 2p ‚Üí4s X-ray
absorption spectrum, arising from the ionic (photoemission) vs neutral (excitonic,
X-ray absorption) character of the final state of each process.
As highlighted by Martensson et al.[5] and Sandell et al.[6, 7] in the context of argon
adsorption on graphite, the observation that the Ar 2p3/2 binding energy is signifi-
cantly lower than that of the X-ray absorption peak is already a clear indication that
the ionic state is considerably more energetically favourable than the excitonic, charge
neutral state ‚Äì this is ultimately the driving force for transfer of the 4s electron to
the environment. We note that the difference of 2.7 ¬± 0.1 eV is rather higher than
the value of 2.1 eV observed for argon on graphite[6], but identical to the 2.72 eV
value reported by Lizzit et al.[8] for argon on a weakly coupled graphene monolayer

Wide-energy-range X-ray absorption spectrum for energies close to the Ar 2p (i.e. L2,3) absorption
edges, measured by recording the sample drain current as a function of photon energy ‚Äì a total electron
yield measurement. Throughout the work described in the main paper and this supplement, we have
focussed on absorption across the Ar 2p3/2 ‚Üí4s resonance highlighted by the gray rectangle. See
Wurth et al.[4] for a description of the origin of the other, higher lying resonances in the context of
condensed ‚Äúbare‚Äù argon multilayers. Inset: Ar 2p core-level photoemission spectrum (in red) plotted
on same energy axis as the Ar 2p ‚Üí4s X-ray absorption spectrum (in blue). The energy of the core-
level photoemission spectrum is referenced to the Fermi level and the 2p3/2-related spectra have been
normalised to equivalent heights for ease of comparison.
