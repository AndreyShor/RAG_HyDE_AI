such that the matrix elements in decay kinematics ex-
pressed in terms of Q2, t and u don’t have any explicit
imaginary parts. In decay kinematics we find
s > 0,
t > 0,
u > 0.

There are three distinct matrix elements required for
the production of a Higgs boson and a parton in the
collision of two partons. We refer to this configuration as
scattering region .
g(−k1) + g(−k2) →H(q) + g(k3),
g(−k1) + q(−k2) →H(q) + q(k3),
q(−k1) + ¯q(−k2) →H(q) + g(k3).

We obtain the associated matrix elments by crossing the
decay matrix elements and permuting of external mo-
menta.
Exchanging quarks and anti-quarks leaves the
interfered matrix elements invariant and all other con-
figurations can simply be obtained by re-labeling of the
momenta. In the scattering region, we find that
s > 0,
t < 0,
u < 0.

For convenience, we introduce the variables ˆt = −t and
ˆu = −u with which we express our scattering matrix
elements in the scattering region.

Through two loops we perform our computation for QCD
with nf massless quark flavors and general color gauge
group of SU(Nc). In the case of the three-loop ampli-
tudes, we limit our computation to the generalized lead-
ing color limit. In this limit we treat the number of col-
ors Nc and flavors nf as large and neglect contributions
suppressed by powers of 1/N 2
c .
This generalized lead-
ing color limit has shown to be a highly effective ap-
proximation for similar scattering amplitudes [60, 75],
as can be easily understood from the fact that it para-
metrically approximates matrix elements up to O(10%)
corrections. Specifically, this implies that we include the
coefficients of the terms proportional to any one of the
factors {N 6

wise. Our results are expressed in terms of a Laurent
expansion in the dimensional regulator ϵ including all
terms required for a N3LO computation of the discussed
scattering and decay processes. The coefficients of these
expansions are expressed in terms of ratios of polynomi-
als and generalized polylogarithms [76] of our kinematic
variables.
CALCULATION
We generate the Feynman diagrams for our scattering
amplitudes with qgraf [77]. We compute gauge invariant
scattering amplitudes in conventional dimensional regu-
larization using tensor decomposition (see for example
refs. [48, 52, 58, 78, 79]) through two loops and interfer-
ences of tree and three-loop scattering amplitudes. We
use our in-house Mathematica and C++ packages to com-
pute our amplitudes, including contracting the Lorentz
and color indices. Then, we express all the squared am-
plitudes as linear combinations of scalar integrals and
classify them in terms of integral families. We utilize the
package CalcLoop [80] to fully exploit external symmetry
among Feynman integrals. Once we identified a minimal
set of Feynman integrals that can no longer be reduced
by symmetry relations of the external and loop momenta,
we employ Integration-By-Part (IBP) identities [81–83]
by virtue of the Laporta algorithm [83] to reduce our in-
tegrals to a set of so-called master integrals. This step
represents one of the most challenging portions of our
computation due to the high degree of complexity of the
integrals involved in this problem. Specifically, the inte-
gral reduction code Blade [84] developed by one of the
authors incorporates the cutting edge of IBP reduction
technology enabling us to achieve our results. This in-
cludes the block-triangular form [85, 86], improved seed-
ing [84, 87], the spanning-sector reduction algorithm [84],
and the finite field technique [88] implemented within
FiniteFlow [89].
To compute the residual set of master integrals we
make use of the method of differential equations [90–94]
and relate them to a basis of so-called canonical master
integrals [94]. In particular, a large portion of canonical
three-loop integrals was identified in refs. [51, 95–98] and
we relate our master integrals to the canonical results in
the literature. In addition, we identified canonical one-
loop and two-loop integrals as well as master integrals in
two additional three-loop families that we could not iden-
tify in the literature. We checked the existing results for
canonical differential equations. For the remaining mas-
ter integrals we find a canonical set of master integrals
using algorithmic methods [99]. We compute boundary
conditions for the differential equations using the meth-
ods of for example refs. [100–102] and confirm existing re-
sults in the decay region. We solve the canonical master
integrals in terms of Chen iterated integrals [103] and in-
sert them into our newly computed scattering amplitudes
in the decay region. Next, we rewrite the remaining iter-
ated integrals in terms of multiple polylogarithms [76] us-
ing methods outlined for example in refs. [104–109]. The
functions appearing in these scattering amplitudes were
studied in some detail in ref. [51]. The multiple polylog-
arithms can readily be evaluated using public software,
see for example ref. [110, 111]. To obtain results for am-
plitudes in the scattering region we cross the external
particles accordingly and analytically continue our func-
tions.
