The above expression of entropy is dependent on the UV cutoff ϵ, which appears because of the presence of high energy
vacuum fluctuations. However, assuming ϵ to be a constant, the relative entropy of different regions will be independent
of ϵ.
By repeating the above calculation for the correlator Eq.(14) for an interval in a spacetime conformal to (1+1)
dimensional Minkowski spacetime, i.e, gµν = Ω2ηµν, one gets the following expression of entanglement entropy, in terms
of null coordinates (u,v), for a massless Dirac field [66; 67; 68] :

Figure 3: The above plots show the mutual information between two disjoint intervals in a freely falling frame computed
using the resolvent technique discussed in section 2.4. We keep the proper distance between two disjoint intervals at a
fixed Painleve-Gulstrand time slice constant and vary the distance from the event horizon.
one-third of the natural logarithm of the conformal distance between two corners 4. Using Eq.(47) again for the two
disjoint regions [A, B] and [C, D] one can obtain S[A,B] S[C,D]. The substitution of the resultant expression along with
Eq.(48) in the definition of mutual information
I := S[A,B] + S[C,D] −S[A,B] S[C,D]

Here, (u1, v1) and (u2, v2) are the coordinates of the corners of the interval [A, B], and (u3, v3) and (u4, v4) are those
of the interval [C, D]. All corners are ordered by increasing/decreasing spatial coordinates. The above expression of
mutual information between two disjoint intervals is Weyl invariant. In particular, it remains invariant under any single
transformation or any combination of the following transformations:
4The conformal distance transforms covariantly under all conformal isometries of the conformally flat spacetime [69].
5This is valid for a massless fermionic field of Dirac type with central charge c = 1 in 1+1 dimensions.
