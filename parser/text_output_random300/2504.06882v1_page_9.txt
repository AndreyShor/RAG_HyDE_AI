FIG. S2: E4 pages of orientable Mα with nontrivial map d and α = 0, 5, . . . , 9. The horizontal axis corresponds to p and
the vertical axis to q. The red dashed line represents filtration of K0(Mα) and the blue dashed line represents filtration of
K1(Mα).
In this case, the map d sends 1 ∈Z to some integer N ∈Z. When N = 0, no update occurs on the E4 page, i.e.,
Ep,q
4
∼= Ep,q
3 . However, if N ̸= 0, the E4 page is updated as shown in Fig. S2. However, this case can be ruled out.
By filtration, we obtain the group extension of K0(Mα):
0 →0 →K0(Mα) →H2(Mα, Z) →0.
(S10)
This implies that eK(Mα) ⊕Z ∼= K0(Mα) ∼= H2(Mα, Z), which contradicts the fact that the map Det : eK(Mα) →
H2(Mα, Z) is surjective. Therefore, the map d must be trivial, and the filtration of the K-groups, as shown in Fig. S1,
gives the group extensions:
0 →H0(Mα, Z) →K0(Mα) →H2(Mα, Z) →0,
(S11)
and
0 →H1(Mα, Z) →K1(Mα) →H3(Mα, Z) →0,
(S12)
for α = 0, 5, . . . , 9.
On the other hand, for non-orientable Mα with α = 1, . . . , 4, the chain complex in Eq. (S8) takes the form:
0 →Z
d−→Z2 →0.
(S13)
The map d can either be trivial or map to the parity of an integer. If d is trivial, there is no update in the spectral
sequence, i.e., Ep,q
4
∼= Ep,q
3 . However, if d maps to the parity of an integer, the E4 page will be updated as shown in
Fig. S3.
In both cases, regardless of whether d is trivial or not, the group extension of K0(Mα) can be given by
0 →H0(Mα, Z) →K0(Mα) →H2(Mα, Z) →0,
(S14)
for α = 1, . . . , 4. This has the same form as Eq. (S11). Moreover, the extension of K1(Mα) can be given by
0 →H1(Mα, Z) →K1(Mα) →H3(Mα, Z) →0,
(S15)
while if d is nontrivial, the extension can be expressed as
0 →H1(Mα, Z) →K1(Mα) →0 →0.
(S16)
In conclusion, for all ten platycosms, K0(Mα) can be computed using the group extension
0 →Z →K0(Mα) →H2(Mα, Z) →0,
(S17)
where we use H0(Mα, Z) ∼= Z. For K1(Mα), when Mα is orientable, it’s group extension must be given by
0 →H1(Mα, Z) →K1(Mα) →Z →0.
