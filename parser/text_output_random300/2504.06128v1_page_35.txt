where the last equality is justified by choosing MN Ñ 8 slowly enough. Indeed, by (4.48),
for any fixed M ă 8, there is N “ NM large enough such that
@N ě NM, @1 ď i ď M :
Erp∆N,iq4 | FNi´1s ď C4

We can assume that limMÑ8 NM “ 8. Hence we can choose a sequence pMNqNÑ8 with
MN Ñ 8 slowly enough such that N ě NMN , and hence

Condition (4.52) follows in the same way via Chebyshev’s inequality and the higher
moment estimate (4.48). In turn, this implies (4.53) and (4.54), which are respectively our
desired relation (4.13) and (4.12).
Step 7. Proof of (4.14). To show the negligibility of the second term in (4.14), i.e.,
řMN

which goes to 0 if MN Ñ 8 slowly enough such that MN ! pδNq´ 1

For the first term in (4.14), recall that rpxq “ logp1 ` xq ´

which converges to 0 by (4.52) and (4.53) and by letting ε be arbitrarily small.
The proof of (4.2) is now complete.

5. Higher moment bounds
We prove a strengthened version of the general moment bound in Theorem 1.11. We
consider the averaged point-to-point partition function ZLpφ, ψq defined in (1.17): for φ, ψ :
Z2 Ñ R and L P N,
