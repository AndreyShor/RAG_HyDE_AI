Figure 1.4: We depict three simple cases of interior four-arm events (where the disk around z
and the half-disk around y have radii ε and r, respectively). None of them belongs to the event
E4(ε, z, y, r) considered in [42] (see (6.7) for a precise definition). Our Theorem 1.3 implies, after
a conformal map from H onto D, that the probabilities of these events are upper-bounded by a
constant times εξ4(κ).
• In fact, it is this specific upper bound that was obtained in [42, Proposition 4.1] in the interior
case:
P[E2j(ε, z, y, r) ∩F] ≤εξ2j+o(1),
for some well-suited event F, involving a non-explicit quantity R (see Proposition 6.2 below).
As we explain in Remark 6.3, we fix (in the case j = 2 and κ ∈(8/3, 4]) an essential gap in
the proof of that result. Furthermore, we give a better upper bound, which is up-to-constant.

Organization of the paper
After collecting some useful earlier results in Section 2, we show estimates on two-arm probabilities
in Section 3, as a warm-up for the more complicated situation of four arms.
We then derive
separation properties in Section 4, where we prove a strenghtened version of Theorem 1.2, which
is suitable for our later proofs (Proposition 4.1). In that section, which is the core of our paper,
we also deduce the equivalence of various four-arm events from the separation result. We then
use these tools to establish up-to-constants estimates for four-arm events in CLE (Theorem 1.1) in
Section 5, before obtaining our general four-arm estimates for SLE (Theorem 1.3) in Section 6.

Preliminaries
In this section, we recall a few results that will be useful later on. In the whole paper, we let
H := {z ∈C : ℑz > 0} be the upper half-plane, and we let D denote the unit disk (with center 0
and radius 1). For any z ∈C, let Br(z) := {z′ ∈C : |z −z′| < r} be the ball with radius r > 0
centered on z, and Ar,R(z) := {z′ ∈C : r < |z −z′| < R} be the annulus with radii 0 < r < R
around z. Furthermore, we write Br = Br(0) and Ar,R = Ar,R(0). If a set C intersects both ∂Br(z)
and ∂BR(z), we say that it crosses the annulus Ar,R(z).
Lemma 2.1 (Koebe 1/4 in the upper half-plane). Let K ⊂H be a compact such that H := H \ K
is simply connected. Let f be a conformal map from H onto H with f(∞) = ∞. For z ∈R and
r > 0 such that Br(z) ∩H ⊆H, we have
Bf′(z)r/4(f(z)) ∩H ⊆f(Br(z) ∩H) ⊆B4f′(z)r(f(z)) ∩H.
