tering states, whereas for bound states they form a string
configuration [78, 80, 82, 83]: s(iz1)−s(iz2)−2γ = 0 with
s(z) ∶= (z−1/z)/2i. Several studies [52, 53, 77, 78, 84–86]
have argued that the long-time dynamics under dephas-
ing noise is determined by bound states based on the
analysis of the spectrum in the GKSL equation on a fi-
nite lattice. Our asymptotic analysis shows that, without
the string hypothesis [78, 80, 82, 83], the long-time dy-
namics is dominated by the bound states even in systems
with infinitely many particles.
Similarly to q1(t), one can decompose q2(t) into con-
tributions from the scattering and the bound states, and
show that a contribution composed entirely of the bound
states remains finite in the long-time limit, while the
others are exponentially small. We then apply the sad-
dle point method to ˜q2(t) ∶= 2q2(t) −q2
1(t), obtaining

This is the main result of our work. Comparing Eq. (14)
with Eq. (12), one clearly sees that the presence of the
dephasing, no matter how small, drastically change the
nature of current fluctuations from ballistic to diffusive.
Finally, we numerically verify our analytical result in
Eq. (14). In Fig. 2, we show the time evolution of σ2
Qt.
One finds that Eq. (14) holds well for τ ≫1. Here the
numerical results are obtained from the unraveling of the
GKSL equation [59, 87, 88]. See Sec. VII of SM [76] for
the details of the numerical simulation.
Comparison to SEP.— In the strong dephasing limit,
our system is effectively described by a well-known clas-
sical Markov process, SEP [89, 90], as a consequence
of second-order perturbation theory [91].
Even for fi-
nite dephasing strength, several studies have argued that
the long-time dynamics is governed by SEP [46–48, 58].
However, these studies basically focus on the behavior
of steady states [46–48] or the average behavior of non-
stationary states [58].
We here confirm this connec-
tion for current fluctuations in non-stationary regimes
by comparing the variance between the two models. We
also compute the cumulant generating function numer-
ically and compare it with the analytical result in SEP
[66], finding agreement in higher-order fluctuations.
For SEP with the step initial condition, the exact so-
lution of the cumulant generating function has been ob-
tained via the Bethe ansatz technique [66]. Its asymp-
totic form in the long-time limit is given by
χSEP(λ,τ) ≃√τ ∫
∞
−∞dk log(1 + ωe−k2)/π.
(15)
Here, ω is exactly the same as in our model.
Similar
result has also been obtained within the framework of
the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) [92].
The variance of the integrated current for SEP can
be obtained by differentiating Eq. (15) with respect to
λ, which is in perfect agreement with Eq. (14). To fur-
ther investigation, we numerically evaluate the cumulant
generating function χ(λ,t) with the rescaled time τ and
compare it with Eq. (15). See Sec. VII of SM [76] for our
numerical method. In Fig. 3, we present the numerical
result of χ(λ,t) for ρa = 1 and ρb = 0 as the function
of λ, alongside χSEP(λ,τ). As illustrated in Fig. 3, the
cumulant generating function in our model agrees with
that in SEP. Although our verification is limited to the
case, ρa = 1 and ρb = 0, the ω-dependence implies that
the agreement holds for any ρa and ρb.
Conclusion and future prospects.— We theoretically
studied the current fluctuations in the tight-binding
chain with the dephasing noise under the step initial con-
dition.
Our main results are the exact expression for
the variance of the integrated current and its asymptotic
form in the long-time limit, revealing that, instead of
ballistic behavior, diffusive current fluctuations always
emerges whenever the dephasing strength, no matter how
small, is positive.
This result was obtained by utiliz-
ing the ω-dependence and the integral formula for the
Green’s function, which are analogous to techniques suc-
cessfully applied to classical stochastic interacting sys-
tems [65–68]. We proved the ω-dependence, namely the
nontrivial dependence of the moment generating function
on the counting field λ and the densities ρa, ρb, by utiliz-
ing the particle-hole symmetry and the duality relation
between the density matrix and the correlation function
[77, 78]. The integral formula was proved by employing
the Bethe ansatz technique on the infinite interval. Fur-
thermore, we observed that the asymptotic form of the
variance coincides with that in SEP and numerically con-
firmed that the cumulant generating function also agrees.
As a prospect, it is important to exactly calculate
