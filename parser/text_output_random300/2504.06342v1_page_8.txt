where 𝜏cool is the cooling timescale computed via
the cooling algorithm (detailed in §2.6), and 𝜏dyn is
the dynamical timescale determined by the min-
imum of the local free-fall time and rotational
timescale:

The model evolution is primarily driven by stellar
mass loss and SNe Ia rates associated with the initial
stellar distribution. Following (Ciotti & Ostriker
2012), we express the stellar mass loss as a piece-
wise function:
Δ𝑀=

0.945𝑀TO −0.503M⊙,
if 𝑀TO < 9M⊙
𝑀TO −1.4M⊙,

where the stellar turn-off mass 𝑀TO follows the
relation:

We note that while star formation and evolution
models in the literature exhibit considerable vari-
ation in parameters and criteria, we have deliber-
ately adopted a simplified prescription. This ap-
proach minimizes free parameters and maintains
the idealized nature of the simulation, facilitating
focused investigation of AGN feedback effects in a
controlled environment.
2.5. Supernova feedback physics
In MACER2D, supernova feedback was imple-
mented as thermal energy injection proportional
to the local SN event rate.
Without identifying
individual SN events, the energy injection was spa-
tially smoothed, acting as an extra heating term in
the energy equation of the hydrodynamic simula-
tion. While computationally efficient, this simpli-
fied approach did not accurately capture the effects
of discrete supernova explosions, such as shock
propagation and turbulence generation in the ISM
and CGM driven by individual events. MACER3D
significantly improves upon this by implementing
a more sophisticated model of supernova feedback
with state-of-the-art prescriptions.
First, we model supernovae as discrete events.
Given their independent nature, we use a Pois-
son distribution to determine the probability of SN
events occurring:
𝑃(𝑁SN; 𝜇SN) =
𝑒−𝜇SN𝜇𝑁SN
SN
𝑁SN!
,
(22)
where 𝜇SN is the expected number of SN events
per unit time in a given region, and 𝑃(𝑁SN; 𝜇SN)
gives the probability of observing 𝑁SN events. The
expectation value 𝜇SN in a given time step Δ𝑡is
determined by the sum of the volume-integrated
type Ia and type II SNe rates:
𝜇SN = (𝑅II + 𝑅Ia) Δ𝑡,
(23)
where 𝑅II and 𝑅Ia are the type II and type Ia SN
rates, respectively, which are adopted from Ciotti
& Ostriker (2012):
𝑅II =

¤𝑀SF(𝑡′)𝑒−𝑡−𝑡′
𝜏II d𝑡′,
(24)
where 𝜖II = 0.1234 is the type II SN efficiency, re-
flecting the fraction of stellar mass from 9 – 120 M⊙
progenitors undergoing core collapse, 𝜏II = 2 ×
107 yr the characteristic type II SN timescale, and
𝑀II,ZAMS = 21.34 M⊙the IMF-averaged ZAMS
mass of type II SN progenitors. The type Ia SN
rate is given by:
