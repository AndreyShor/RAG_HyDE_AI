Resampling property and independence from the threshold
41
Remark 5.3. The reason we introduced the “stronger” pseudometric dX is that the boundaries of
the set Aλ are not disjoint in (X, dX) for different values of λ. In contrast, in (X, dX), we have
∂XAλ1 ∩∂XAλ2 = ∅for any λ1, λ2 > 0 with λ1 ̸= λ2. This fact will play an important role in what
follows.
Lemma 5.4. For each λ > 0, the collection of measures (νb,λ)b>0 converges weakly in (X, dX) to
ν∞,λ as b →∞.
Proof. Let (∞, eΥλ) be sampled from ν∞,λ, and with a slight abuse of notation, let (b, eΥb,λ) be sampled
from νb,λ. Thanks to Theorem A, we know that νb,λ converges weakly to ν∞,λ in (X, dX) as b →∞.
This fact implies that we can find a coupling between the sequence ((b, eΥb))b>0 and (∞, eΥλ) such that
lim
b→∞E[dX((b, eΥb,λ), (∞, eΥλ))] = 0 .
(5.3)
Therefore, to obtain the desired result, we need to check that the same limit holds if we replace the
pseudometric dX in the above display with the pseudometric dX. In particular, it suffices to show that
lim
b→∞E

sup
x∈Rd|χb(x)eceΥb,λ(x) −eceΥλ(x)|

= 0
To this end, we let 0 ≤j ≤b, and we note that
sup
x∈Rd|χb(x)eceΥb,λ(x) −eceΥλ(x)| ≤sup
x∈Bj
|eceΥb,λ(x) −eceΥλ(x)| +
sup
x∈Rd\Bj
|χb(x)eceΥb,λ(x) −eceΥλ(x)| .
The fact that the limit as b →∞of the expectation of the first term on the right-hand side of the above
display goes to zero follows from (5.3). Hence, it remains to show that the expectation of the second
term on the right-hand side of the above display also tends to zero as b →∞, followed by j →∞.
Thanks to Lemmas 4.12 and 4.20, it holds that
lim
j→∞lim
b→∞E

sup
x∈Bb\Bj
eceΥb,λ(x)

= 0 ,
lim
j→∞E

sup
x∈Rd\Bj
eceΥλ(x)

= 0 .
Therefore, recalling that χb(x) = 0 for all |x| ≥eb + 1, it remains to check that
lim
b→∞E

sup
|x|∈[eb,eb+1)
eceΥb,λ(x)

= 0 .
(5.4)
In particular, thanks to Lemma 4.12, for b ≥0 large enough, by recalling the definition (4.2) of the
field Υb and since, by (K2), the function K is supported in B(0, 1), the expectation on the left-hand
side of the above display is bounded above by a multiple of
√
bE

sup
|x|∈[eb,eb+1)
ecΥb(x)1{M0,b(Υb)≤λ}

(5.5)
and thus, we are left with the task of bounding the expectation in the final term of the above display.
To achieve this, we start by noting that, by the Borell-TIS inequality (Lemma C.2) and Fernique’s
majorizing criterion (Lemma C.3), for any y ∈Rd such that B(y, 1) ⊆Rd \ Bb, it holds that
