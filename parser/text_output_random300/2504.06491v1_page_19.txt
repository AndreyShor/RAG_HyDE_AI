Note the use of hats to denote an estimation; this is common notation in fields where linear regressions are more
commonly used, like in Econometrics. In the main text, this notation is abandoned and estimates are described as
such. This regression approach has been shown to be a heteroskedasticity-consistent estimator [? ]. This means it
produces standard errors that are robust to regressor-dependent variance, which is the case in our models due to the
q-dependence of statistical counting errors.
We note that in cases where q-coverage is limited, a phenomenon known as multicollinearity can occur, where high
correlations between fi(q) over the available data lead to large and correlated errors in parameter estimates. This is a
well-studied issue in linear regression and amounts to ambiguity of a trade-off between regressors that appear similar.
Multicollinearity exacerbates the effects of counting errors on coefficient uncertainties and also makes the matrix
inversion in the equation for ˆβW LS above less numerically stable. For the data presented, at high ℏω the q-coverage
diminishes and the counting statistics become worse. Hence, in the main text, we terminate the energy-dependence
of our model at energies where the fits are still highly reliable.
