Figure 3.1: Left: the perturbative charm PDF at Q = 1.51 GeV obtained from NNLO PDFs using NNLO
and N3LO matching conditions. Right: the NNLO perturbative charm PDF including the MHOU computed
as the difference between NNLO and N3LO matching. In both plots our default (fitted) charm PDF is also
shown for comparison.
charm is imposed. The absolute worsening of the total χ2 when the vanishing of intrinsic charm
is imposed is therefore of 166 units, corresponding to a 2σ effects in units of σχ2 = √2ndat.
3.1.2. The perturbative charm
In the absence of intrinsic charm, the charm PDF is fully determined by perturbative matching
conditions, i.e. by the matrix A(nf)(Q2
c) in Eqs. (1.101) and (1.102). We will denote the
charm PDF thus obtained as “perturbative charm PDF”, for short. The PDF uncertainty on the
perturbative charm PDF is directly related to that of the light quarks and especially the gluon,
and is typically much smaller than the uncertainty on our fitted charm PDF, that includes a
possible intrinsic charm. Here and in the following we will refer to our result of fitted 4FNS
charm as “default”. It should be noticed that the matching conditions for charm are nontrivial
starting from NNLO: while at NLO the perturbative charm PDF vanishes at threshold. Hence,
having implemented in EKO also the N3LO matching conditions, we are able to assess the MHOU
of the perturbative charm at the matching scale Qc, by comparing results obtained at the first
two non-vanishing perturbative orders.
We construct a PDF set with perturbative charm, in which the full PDF determination from the
global dataset leading to the NNPDF4.0 PDF set is repeated, but now with the assumption that
l.h.s of Eq. (3.1) is fixed by the matching condition at Qc and the following DGLAP evolution
from Qc →Q0. This perturbative charm PDF is compared to our default result in Fig. 3.1 (left),
where the 4FNS perturbative charm PDF at scale Qc = mc obtained using either NNLO or N3LO
under the assumption of no intrinsic charm are shown, together with our default result allowing
for possible intrinsic charm. It is clear that while on the one hand, the PDF uncertainty on the
perturbative charm PDF is indeed tiny, on the other hand the difference between the result
for perturbative charm obtained using NNLO or N3LO matching is large, and in fact larger at
small-x than the difference between perturbative charm and our default (fitted) result.
