Figure 1:
Three examples of inflationary power spectra + gaussian peak (corresponding to Apeak =
0.01, 0.1, 0.1 and kpeak = 6 × 1018, 6 × 1020, 6 × 1022Mpc−1 respectively), that we compare against the
constraints on the power spectrum of curvature perturbations from PBH [17, 56, 69], Planck observations
on the CMB [67], Lyman-α forest [70], µ-distortions [71] and GWs [58, 72, 73] (PTA, SKA and LISA). The
continuous (dashed) lines represent current (forecasted) constraints. The dotted-dashed lines for the PBH
constraint represent the constraints associated with the non-standard scenarios like Hawking evaporation
considerations and the possibility of PBH remnants. The above Figure is produced from the data available
in [56, 73].
radiation and Planck-size remnants after PBH evaporation [58]. We will remain agnostic
about these last constraints and consider values of PR(k) that are both above and below
them, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Furthermore, the positions of the Gaussian peaks of the
power spectra shown in Fig. 1 correspond to scales that exit the horizon at a time close to
the end of inflation, when the scalar field is of the order of the Planck mass.
According to Planck’s results [67, 68], the upper limit on the energy density at the
pivot scale is given by ρinf ≲1016GeV, which translates into the following upper limit on
the Hubble rate at the pivot scale Hinf ≲2.5 × 10−5Mpl. We further assume that H is
constant during inflation and extrapolate that value till the end of inflation, where the
preheating period begins. This phase is characterized by an oscillating scalar field at the
bottom of the inflationary potential, which makes the universe (effectively) behave as being
matter-dominated and implies that the scale factor can be parametrized as
a(t) ≃aend

where the suffix “end” means the quantity at the end of inflation and t is cosmic time. Also,
the Hubble rate, defined as H(t) = ˙a/a, with an overdot denoting a derivative with respect
to cosmic time, is given by
H(t) ≃2
