width parameters, each with an amplitude weight, being for
the one (double-sided) gaussian, and two one-sided exponen-
tials. We then evaluate the combined weight using WdT and
compute our logarithmic index as follows:
LdT = 2 log2 (40WdT).
(14)
Here the factor of 40 inside the log sets our baseline width at
0.025 to give an index of zero, and the multiplier 2 means that
increments of 2 imply a doubling of WdT. The range spanned
by the LdT index depends on the slice of data for which LdT
is being evaluated. For a one hour slice based on one mag-
netic latitude zone and all-longitudes, the typical variation is
between 2 for ordinary quiet conditions, and 6 for with signif-
icant activity; however for smaller slices (e.g. restricting to a
single 30 degree longitude dodecant) the variation is greater
– the lower value can drop below zero, and the highest value
might exceed 8.
To indicate both the typical level of activity as well as report
on its extremes, we divide the dodecant set of longitude slices
(and their computed LdT values) up into three parts We:
(a) estimate a maximum by averaging the two largest LdT val-
ues in the set,
(b) estimate a minimum by averaging the two smallest LdT
values in the set,
(c) estimate a midpoint by averaging the remainder of the LdT
values, i.e. the middle eight values.
The result is that we can report the presence of large-scale
irregularities forming in the ionosphere in some latitude band
in terms of both a typical value (the average of the non-
extreme values) and its likely maximum excursions. Note that
if all dodecants fail to return a valid LdT, we simply use fewer
values for the midpoint average; this eventuality is most com-
mon in southern polar latitudes due to the sparse distribution
of ground stations.
On Figs. 6 and 8 we can see how this LdT index varies over
time hour-by-hour, and how it varies between longitude dode-
cants for high and low magnetic latitudes. Note that although
plotted using this logarithmic index, these figures would, at a
glance, look rather similar if the WdT width measure had been
plotted instead.
For the quiet day result shown on Fig. 6, notice that the
variation in all “remainder” averaged LdT’s is only a factor
of about two, and have a maximum LdT of about four; and
that the spread between maximum/minimum markers is usu-
ally relatively contained. Notwithstanding this general quiet
behaviour, we can still see some outliers where LdT was high,
notably at southern high latitudes (2s). The low activity levels
seen on the map Fig. 7 generated for 11:00UTC on doy 006
are in agreement with the LdT measures on Fig. 6. Of course,
more detail could be brought out by altering the colour scale,
but we retain our default so that this map can be compared
directly to those with strong activity shown later in Fig. 9
In stark contrast to those quiet day results, for the April
2023 active days shown on Fig. 8, notice that on day 114, even
the average (“remainder”) LdT for high northern latitudes (2n)
decreases from about 8 down to 2, at high southern latitudes
(2s) the trend is noisier but nevertheless varies from 10 down
to 4 – i.e. both by a factor of about eight (23); whereas the
change at equatorial latitudes is much smaller (about 2). Fur-
ther, the maximum/minimum markers indicate considerable

Log scale index LdT for our chosen quiet days in 2022
006/007; showing variation by time (UT) and longitude dodecant
for high northern magnetic latitudes (2n), low latitudes (0), and high
southern magnetic latitudes (2s). Here we indicate the range in LdT
activity by dividing the dodecant LdT widths up into three, the two
maximum (averaged to give points ⋏), the two minimum (averaged
to give points ⋎), and the remaining eight widths (averaged to give
points •).

Sample map showing moderated dTEC variances accu-
mulated over a not-untypical hour (11:00UTC) from the quiet day
2022/006, and binned into staggered 5x5 degree pixels. Dark blue
areas indicate no data, the darkest (near-black) regions indicate the
smallest dTEC standard deviations σ, ranging through to white for
dTEC σ > 1. Note that isolated bright white squares that sometimes
appear on these automatically generated maps are typically due to
difficult to filter data or processing artifacts.
variation between different longitude dodecants. In Fig. 7 we
show geographical activity maps timed at the apparent north-
ern polar peak (21:00UTC doy 113) and then in its trailing dip
at 03:00 on doy 115; these both show the widespread extent
of GNSS-effective activity during those storms.
However, although on Fig. 8 there looks to be a remarkable
match between variation of KP and the LdT for high northern
latitudes (2n), note that here KP does not provide a good in-
dicator in other latitude bands – not even for high southern
latitudes. Further, on Fig. 10 we show a similar comparison
using recent data for the May 2024 storm, and in this case –
as shown at at high northern latitudes – we can see that KP
seems less convincing as a proxy for the GNSS-effective ac-
