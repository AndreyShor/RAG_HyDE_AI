However, in the presence of the SOC (i.e.,
λ ̸= 0), the Hamiltonian falls into class AIII, preserv-
ing only the chiral symmetry Γ. According to the AZ
classiﬁcation [6], a fully gapped energy spectrum of Hkx,s
allows us to deﬁne the 1D winding number:

where the trace is taken over both the Nambu space and
the lattice sites along the y direction. The unidirectional
SOC is essential for deﬁning the 1D winding number N1D,
as generic SOCs such as Rashba SOC break spin-rotation
symmetry.
In this case, the Q1D systems are in class
DIII, and the AZ classiﬁcation changes from Z to Z2.
Figures 1(b)–1(d) present the energy eigenvalues of
Hkx,s as a function of kx, which are obtained by diagonal-
izing Hkx,s numerically. The parameters are set as µ = t
and ∆= 0.2t.
The superconducting coherence length
is evaluated as ξ = 1/{πartanh(∆/2t)} ∼3.17a. Note
that the energy eigenvalues of Hkx,↑and those of Hkx,↓
are completely overlapped due to Kramers degeneracy.
In Fig. 1(b), we plot the energy eigenvalues with λ = 0,
where the system width is suﬃciently larger than the
superconducting coherence length, W = 800a ∼252ξ.
In this regime, the ﬂat-band ABSs are crearly visible at
zero energy. In Fig. 1(c), we show the energy eigenvalues
with λ = 0 in a narrower system with W = 30a ∼9.46ξ.
The ﬁnite-size eﬀects leads to hybridization between the
ABSs localized at y/a = 1 and y/a = W/a, resulting in
the breakdown of the ﬂat-band structure. Nevertheless,
multiple band crossings persist at zero energy. As de-
tailed in the Supplemental Material (SM) [72], these band
crossings are protected by inversion symmetry [73, 74],
which holds only in the absence of the SOC (i.e., λ = 0).
Consequently, introducing the unidirectional SOC is ex-
pected to open a full energy gap in the ABS spectrum.
This is indeed observed in Fig. 1(d), where the SOC is
introduced with λ = 0.5t. Since Hkx,s now describes the
gapped systems in class AIII, the 1D winding number
N1D in Eq. (6) becomes well deﬁned.
In Fig. 2(a), the 1D winding number N1D is plotted as
a function of the system width W, with λ = 0.5t. The
results show that N1D increases with W and reaches val-
ues substantially larger than unity. For instance, at W =
30a ∼9.46ξ, the winding number reaches N1D = 20. The

}. The factor of two reﬂects spin de-
generacy. Notably, N1D closely tracks Nc, and the under-
lying mechanism is discussed later. The bulk-boundary
correspondence guarantees the presence of N1D-fold de-
generate ZESs at the system edge. In Fig. 2(b), we show
the energy eigenvalues under open boundary conditions
in both x and y directions, where the system is placed
on 1 ≤j ≤L/a.
We choose W = 30a ∼9.46ξ and
L = 600a ∼189.27ξ. The colored (white) dots indicate
the result for λ = 0.5t (λ = 0); each dot represents a two-

fold degenerate state caused by Kramers degeneracy. In
the absence of SOC, the energy spectrum remains gap-
less. When SOC is present, 2N1D ZESs appear inside the
ﬁnite energy gap Eg, where the factor of two arises from
both edges in the x direction. Under the present param-
eters, the system hosts 40 ZESs. The winding number is
limited by the number of Fermi points in the 1D Brillouin
zone [45], which typically results in small values. In con-
trast, the proposed Q1D system exhibits multiple band
crossings due to the ﬁnite-size eﬀect and consequently
supports an exceptionally large number of the topologi-
cally protected ZESs.
We examine the size of the induced energy gap, Eg, as
also indicated in Fig. 1(d). In Fig. 2(a), Eg is plotted as
a function of the system width W. The solid and dashed
lines correspond to λ = 0.5t and λ = t, respectively.
As W increases, the induced gap Eg exhibits oscillatory
decay, with larger values of λ yielding larger gaps. We
now adopt Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 as the parent SC, which has
a large superconducting gap, ∆∼30 meV [70, 71]. With
its in-plane lattice constant a ∼5.4 ˚A, the supercon-
ducting coherent length is estimated as ξ ∼1.71 nm. As
