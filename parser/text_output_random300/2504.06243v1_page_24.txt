which is indeed the beta function for λϕ4 theory.
B.2. Cascade states
We may likewise reproduce the results in Sec. 3.1 for the beta function for interactions of the
form (3.11) in cascade states nk ∼k−γ. We find the recursion relation for the sum of the leading
log divergence up to order n is,
Λn+1 =



−2Λnλ0L ,
α ≤1 ,
L =
R µ0
µ
ddq
qd = Sd log µ0
µ ,
−2(1 + 4 γ
α)Λnλ0L ,
α > 1 .
(B.5)
In the case that α ≤1, the arrows on every new loop that appears at the next order have to
point in the same direction; otherwise, such terms are subleading. In other words, one has to add
additional diagrams in the s-channel. The only surviving diagrams are then bubble diagrams [29],
such as the ones that commonly appear in large N theories [12,53–59]. The combinatorial factor
of 2 in (B.5) is due to the choice of pairings between two a’s on one vertex and two a†’s on the
other vertex. For α > 1, one must also include the t and u-channels, which gives loops with arrows
in opposite directions. A combinatorial factor of 4 is due to the choice of which a or a† in the first
vertex to contract, and there is another combinatorial factor of 2 from the choice of what it’s being
contracted into in the second vertex. The factor of γ/α comes from the integrand, as discussed in
(3.18) and (3.19). Summing all Λn gives,
λ(µ) =







λ0
1 + 2λ0L ,
α ≤1 ,
λ0
1 + 2(1+4 γ
α)λ0L ,
α > 1 .
(B.6)
Differentiating reproduces the beta function (3.22).
