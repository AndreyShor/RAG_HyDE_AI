k polynomial in the X-fields. Rather than being a massive theory, the small volume phase then
becomes an interacting theory that can be understood as a Landau-Ginzburg theory on a stack
fibred over a geometric base. Indeed, as we will show below, the small volume phase of such models
is an interacting gauge theory and any geometric description in the deep IR has to emerge from a
different mechanism.

Phases
2.2.1.
ζ ≫0-phase
Understanding the classical vacuum in this phase proceeds as usual. The D-term equations
|x|2 −|p|2 = |y|2 −|p|2 = |z|2 −|p|2 = ζ ≫0
(2.15)
have no solution on the following deleted set:
Fζ>0 = {x1 = x2 = x3 = 0} ∪{y1 = y2 = y3 = 0} ∪{z1 = z2 = z3 = 0}.
(2.16)
This implies nonzero values for |x|2, |y|2, |z|2, and therefore σ1 = σ2 = σ3 = 0. The F-term equations
G1 = G2 = G3 = 0 then constrain the x, y, z fields to furnish a complete intersection. If any of
the pi are nonzero then vanishing of pi∂sGi implies that dG1 ∧dG2 ∧dG3 = 0, but we chose Ajkl
i
such that this would not happen, and as a result the vacuum configuration has p1 = p2 = p3 = 0.
Consequently from (2.15) we obtain |x|2 = |y|2 = |z|2 = ζ.
The triples xi, yi, and zi each get constrained to take values in P2 (after modding out each
C3\(0, 0, 0) by the appropriate C∗). The three P2s have the same radius, and moreover the Z3
permutes them.
Therefore, the ambient geometry is the free quotient (P2 × P2 × P2)/Z3.
We
recover the expected geometry3 displayed in (1.1):
Y =

(x, y, z) ∈(P2 × P2 × P2)/Z3 | G1(x, y, z) = G2(x, y, z) = G3(x, y, z) = 0
	
.

For later reference we compute the topological characteristics of Y . It is convenient to introduce
eY , the simply connected cover of Y . This is the complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefold with

Let e1, e2, e3 denote the generating set for H2(eY , Z) given by the pullbacks to eY of each of the
K¨ahler classes of the three P2 factors of the ambient space. The adjunction formula [29] gives

intersection in (P2)3.

with this numbering that we reference.
