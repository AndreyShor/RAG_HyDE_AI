28, n2 = 20, n3 = 8) with a = 32 and corresponds to one way of embedding SU(2) ⊗SU(3) in
E8. Other direct solutions that correspond to the embeddings of M-theory are E8 ⊃SU(2)⊗
E7 and E8 ⊃SU(2). More generally, we have to solve a system of unknowns nj, 0 ≤j ≤123
plus the variable a. We have not attempted to do this due to the computational complexity
of the problem, but it should be remarked that we expect to find plenty, corresponding to the
many different ways to embed SU(2) into E8. Furthermore, SU(2) embeds on any other non-
abelian group G, so by solving the non-chiral problem in full generality we will find avatars
of all possible non-supersymmetric boundary conditions of M-theory that may exist (such as
the G2 solution in Subsection 3.1), for any Lie group G). This case therefore also constitutes
a promising area for future research.

Conclusions
M-theory admits an end of the world M9 brane with E8 gauge fields and N = 1 supersym-
metry, but we do not know whether this is the only possibility. In this paper we have taken
the first steps towards identifying possible alternative end-of-the-world boundary conditions
for M-theory, that satisfy the stringent anomaly cancellation criteria. Any such boundary
condition other than the M9 brane would necessarily be nonsupersymmetric.
We have written down the precise system of equations that encode the anomaly, and
thoroughly explored the space of solutions where the end of the world brane contains a single
simple factor G and all chiral fermions have the same chirality.
We have carried out a complete exploration of the algebras G2, F4, E6, E7, Cn≥3, finding
solutions with an anomaly polynomial allowing for an embedding in M-theory. We have fully
solved this problem in the case where the spectrum is assumed to be chiral, and found several
solutions; however, the matter content of these can be traced back to branching rules of E8
under those groups. Thus, they obey the factorization found in [1], but do not lead to a
genuinely new solution – they merely describe what happens when one takes the Horava-
Witten brane and restricts the E8 gauge group to a subgroup. Algebras An≥5, Bn≥6, Dn≥7
can also be ruled out as candidates for new non-supersymmetric boundary conditions of M-
