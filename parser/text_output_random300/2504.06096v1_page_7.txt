Figure 2: Distribution of background-subtracted dimuon invariant mass for Σ+ →pµ+µ−
candidates in data compared with simulation. LHCb PHSP simulation is shown as is (blue line),
and weighted according to the SM amplitude [2,3] (red band). Note: the distributions in this
figure are not corrected for the efficiencies.
range. The local p-value of the background-only hypothesis is shown in Appendix A.3
as a function of the dimuon invariant mass. No significant signal is found; the most
significant point occurs at 247.06 MeV/c2, with a p-value of 3.5%. When considering a
putative candidate with a mass mX0 = 214.3 MeV/c2 [11], the fractional contribution to
all candidates in the mass window is 5% and the difference with respect to the expected
background from the mµ+µ−sidebands (i.e. nonresonant) is −1 candidates.
The Σ+ →pµ+µ−decay is normalised to the Σ+ →pπ0 decay in order to measure its
branching fraction as

The effi-
ciencies in Eq. (1) are factorised into different categories for ease of estimation and each
is evaluated with respect to the previous steps: detector acceptance, reconstruction and
selection, PID, and trigger, and the yields are estimated from fits to their respective
innvariant-mass distributions as described later.
The acceptance, reconstruction, and selection efficiencies are obtained from simulation.
Possible residual differences between data and simulation in the tracking efficiencies
are determined using control data samples [59].
The uncertainty on the theoretical
spectrum is propagated to the efficiency as a systematic uncertainty amounting to 2.5%.
The PID efficiencies are determined from data using samples of kinematically identified
charged particles from B+ →J/ψK+ decays for the muons, and Λ →pπ−decays for the
protons [53]. Systematic uncertainties of about 1% and 5% are associated with the PID
calibration of muons and protons, respectively. Tracking efficiencies are determined in bins
of p and η and compared to those from simulation. The weighted average correction is
calculated and applied to signal and normalisation simulated samples. A total systematic
uncertainty of about 5% is associated with this calibration. The π0 reconstruction efficiency
is calibrated using B+ →J/ψK∗+(→K+π0) and B+ →J/ψK+ decays [60–63], for which
a systematic uncertainty of 7%, mostly due to the branching fractions of the calibration
channels, is assigned.
