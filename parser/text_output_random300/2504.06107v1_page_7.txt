s=0. In this configura-
tion, the two [nn] diquarks only couple to total isospin
I = 0. This feature leads to an additional allowed state:
Hc2[nn]2(5043, 0, 0+) in the I(JP ) = 0(0+) state, which
is absent in the I(JP ) = 0(2+) sector.
Notably, due
to the significant suppression of color-spin mixing, the
mass gaps between I(JP ) = 0(0+) and 0(2+) states are
negligible (∆m < 1 MeV ), maintaining approximate de-
generacy. Apart from Hc2[nn]2(5043, 0, 0+) state, the re-
maining 0(0+) and 2(0+) states still have the same mass,
RMS radii, and decay behavior, and are represented by
the same data set in Table IV.
For the Hc2[nn]2(5043, 0, 0+) state, because of the low
mass and narrow width, it may be the most ideal in the
doubly-charmed hexaquark system.
In this scheme, it
is potential to observe this state. Its unique properties
are as follows: first, both [nn] diquarks in the state are
scalar diquarks with I = 0, S = 0.
Compared with
other diquark configurations, the structures of this sys-
tem have an antisymmetric color part and an antisym-
metric spin part, which result in the strongest internal
confinement potential and chromomagnetic interaction,
