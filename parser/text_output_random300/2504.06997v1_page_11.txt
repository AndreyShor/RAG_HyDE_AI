Fig. 5 Examples of noise calculation. (a) A waveform of detected blood flow changes, where red and light blue 
circles indicate the peak and trough of one cycle. (b) Scaled SPAD ACF and the corresponding fitted single-
exponential decay curves at the peak and trough. (c) The difference between the scaled SPAD ACF and the fitted 
single-exponential decay function at the peak and trough. (d) The standard deviation was calculated over 1000 
frames across five tests, we minified and magnified the original ùúéùúé to get three levels of noise added to the clean 
dataset. 
3.2 CBFi waveform recovery on simulated data 
In this section, we firstly visualized the performance of the proposed DL model in CBFi waveform 
recovery as well as its ability in isolating SBFi variations. Fig. 6 presents the recovered CBFi 
waveform from the simulated dataset of the four-layer slab head model. The results indicate that 
while the DL model effectively reconstructs the CBFi waveform, it tends to underestimate absolute 
CBFi values. This underestimation arises from the two-layer analytical model‚Äôs bias, where the 
scalp and skull are grouped into a single extracerebral layer. Since blood flow in the skull is 
typically minimal, this grouping leads to a downward bias in CBFi estimation22,38. The results 
presented in Fig. 6 align with the two-layer analytical model-induced bias, suggesting that our 
model has learned the same characteristics of the analytical model. As the simulated SBFi was 
programmed to increase linearly (from 1√ó10-6 to 2√ó10-6 mm2/s), the recovered CBFi waveform 
also exhibits a slight upward shift with increasing sample index (time). This suggests that the 
recovered CBFi remains partially influenced by blood flow changes in the shallow layers (i.e., not 
perfectly separating scalp influence). The quantitative analysis of CBFi sensitivity to both CBFi 
and SBFi changes is provided in Sections 3.3 and 3.4.
