whenever a + b = m −1, which induces a symmetric bilinear pairing
⟨−, −⟩LG : A(f) × A(f) →C,
by declaring that ⟨u, v⟩= 0 unless deg u + deg v = (m −1)β.
Deﬁnition 2.9. We call the triple (A(f), •LG, ⟨−, −⟩LG) the LG Frobenius algebra of f. By transport
of structure via φΩ, it deﬁnes the LG Frobenius algebra (Hm−1
pr
(X), •LG, ⟨−, −⟩LG).
3. Main theorem and application
The main goal of this section is to prove Theorem 1.1 that the CY Frobenius algebra structure on
Hm−1
pr
(X) is equivalent to the LG Frobenius algebra structure on Hm−1
pr
(X). The main ingredient of
the proof is to verify that Batyrev–Cox’s map is a ring isomorphism between Hm−1
pr
(X) with CY ring
structure and A(f) with LG ring structure by using Villaﬂor’s generalization [12] of the Carlson–Griﬃths
theorem [4]; we state the main result as Theorem 3.1 in Subsection 3.1. In Subsection 3.2, we prove
Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 2.8. In Subsection 3.3, we deduce a formal non-trivial Frobenius manifold
structure on (A(f), •LG, ⟨−, −⟩LG) and establish Corollary 1.2. In Subsection 3.4, we discuss the case
where P = Pr−1 and provide Example (3.12) where the polynomial f, which is viewed as a function
Cr →C, may have non-isolated and non-compact critical locus. Thus, our construction yields a Frobenius
manifold in a setting not covered by K. Saito’s work on isolated hypersurface singularities or M. Saito’s
generalization [20].
3.1. Comparison of two Frobenius algebras. A natural question is to compare the two (CY versus
LG) ring structures on Hm−1
pr
(X, C). Our main result is that these two ring structures on Hm−1
pr
(X, C)
are in fact isomorphic.
Theorem 3.1. Let X ⊂PΣ be a smooth9 Calabi–Yau hypersurface such that (1.2) is an isomorphism.
For a given element Ω∈H0(PΣ, ˆΩm
PΣ(β)), there is a nowhere-vanishing holomorphic volume form ΩX
on X such that the vector space isomorphism
Φ := c−1
(−1)m−1ΩX ◦φΩ: A(f)
∼
=
−→H0
pr(PV(X))
is a ring isomorphism, i.e.,
Φ([g] · [h]) = Φ([g]) · Φ([h])
where g, h ∈Aβ and [−] is the equivalence class modulo J(f) ∩Aβ.
Note 3.2. We have the following diagram:
R(f) := S/J(f)

pr(X, ∧aTX) = H0
pr(PV(X)).

We prove Theorem 3.1 in Subsection 3.2.
Corollary 3.3. The map Φ in Theorem (3.1) induces an isomorphism between the LG Frobenius algebra
(A(f), •LG, ⟨−, −⟩LG) and the CY Frobenius algebra (H0
pr(PV(X)), •CY, ⟨−, −⟩CY).
Proof. By Proposition 2.2 and Proposition 2.8 with n = m −1, we have the following commutative
diagram
