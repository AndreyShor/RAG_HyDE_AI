Monomials as constants of motion
Having a monomial eigenfunction zµ implies the existence a constant of motion of the form zµe−iµ⊤ωt. If µ⊤ω = 0,
the time dependence disappears, which is convenient when making a change of variables. This is, however, a rather
specific case, because the powers of monomial eigenfunctions are determined by the weight matrix, thus restricting
the natural frequencies satisfying the orthogonality condition. In the more general case, it is possible to combine
eigenfunctions with nonzero eigenvalues to obtain constants of motion with no time dependence, as presented in the
following lemma.
Lemma S5. Let the Kuramoto model in Lem. S3 have natural frequencies ω = (ω1 · · · ωN) and Koopman generator K.
Suppose that K admits 1 ≤q ≤N functionally independent monomial eigenfunctions zµ1, . . . , zµq, where µρ ∈RN for
each 1 ≤ρ ≤q, whose corresponding eigenvalues are given by the vector λ = (iµ⊤
1 ω · · · iµ⊤
q ω)⊤. If all eigenvalues
are nonzero, then there are q −1 functionally independent monomial constants of motion zν1, . . . , zνq−1, defined by
the matrix equation (ν1 · · · νq−1) = (µ1 · · · µq)O where O is a real q × (q −1) matrix having linearly independent
columns orthogonal to λ.
Proof. Denote ψρ(z) = zµρ for all ρ ∈{1, ..., q}. Since z ∈TN, these q monomials are non-vanishing eigenfunctions
of K. Moreover, since the eigenfunctions are also assumed to be functionally independent, the vectors µ1, . . . , µq are
linearly independent and thus span a q-dimensional subspace in RN.
Now, it is known that the product of non-vanishing eigenfunctions yields an eigenfunction with sums of eigenval-
ues [26, Proposition 5]. Explicitly, for any real numbers a1, ..., aq,

Then, Qq

ρ is a constant of motion if and only if the new orthogonality condition a⊤λ = 0 is met. This condition
is nontrivial since, by assumption, no component of λ is zero. Clearly, in this case, the imaginary part of λ lies in Rq
and has a (q−1)-dimensional orthogonal complement. This implies that we can find q−1 linearly independent vectors
aτ = (aτ1 · · · aτq)⊤∈Rq, for τ ∈{1, . . . , q −1}, that are orthogonal to λ. Since monomials of linearly independent
powers are functionally independent, there are q −1 constants of motion having the form

τ ∈{1, ..., q −1},
where ντ = Uaτ with U = (µ1 · · · µq). Altogether, the vectors ν1, . . . , νq−1, which define the monomial constants
of motion, satisfy the matrix equation (ν1 · · · νq−1) = UO, where O = (a1 · · · aq−1). The latter is a real q × (q −1)
matrix with linearity independent columns satisfying O⊤λ = 0, and the lemma follows.
Remark S9. The above lemma remains valid if the condition “all eigenvalues are nonzero” is replaced by “at least
one eigenvalue is nonzero.” However, in this case, some eigenfunctions zµρ are themselves constants of motion,
and thus some of the resulting constants of motion zντ may factor through them — that is, they include terms
like zµρ as multiplicative factors. As a result, the two sets of constants of motion become functionally dependent.
The condition that all eigenvalues are nonzero therefore ensures the cleanest setting, where the only functionally
independent constants of motion are precisely the monomials zντ .

Basic examples for Theorem 1 and the conservation of monomials
Example S10. Consider a (sink) directed star of five Kuramoto oscillators such that
˙z1 = iω1z1 + (A12z2 −¯A12¯z2z2
1) + (A13z3 −¯A13¯z3z2
1) + (A14z4 −¯A14¯z4z2
1) + (A15z5 −¯A15¯z5z2
1)
˙zk = iωkzk ,
k ∈{2, 3, 4, 5}.
Clearly, the last four equations readily inform that z2, z3, z4, z5 are q = 4 monomial eigenfunctions with respective
eigenvalues λ = (iω2 iω3 iω4 iω5) (let’s assume they are not zero). From Lem. S5, those eigenfunctions can be
combined to obtain 3 functionally independent constants of motion. For example, zω3

is
a set of independent constants of motion, along with the time-dependent integral z5e−ω5t.
