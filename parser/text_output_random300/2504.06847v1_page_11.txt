along the b axis (see Fig. S6, Supplementary material). The sulfate anions in the chains interact 
with pairs of symmetry-independent cations (see Fig. S7, Supplementary material) by pairs of 
N-H…O hydrogen bonds (donor-acceptor distances ranging from 2.637(1) Å to 2.983(1) Å) to

graph-set descriptor. The 
resulting 3D crystal structure (see Fig. 6) also incorporates several cation…water interactions 
(i.e., N-H…O, C-H…O and C-H…N hydrogen bonds) – see Table S9, Supplementary material. 
The crystals of (2-Amp)2SO4H2O are isostructural with the previously reported bis(2-
aminopyrimidinium(1+)) selenate monohydrate [52]. 
Discussed salts of 2-Amp with sulfuric acid – i.e., 2-AmpHSO4(I) (this work and [50]), 2-
AmpHSO4(II) (this work and [51]), (2-Amp)2SO4H2O (this work and [50]) together with 
bis(2-aminopyrimidinium(1+)) sulfate (2-Amp)2SO4 [53] represent an exciting group of 
molecular crystals with different structural roles of anions in the crystal packing. In the case of 
(2-Amp)2SO4 and (2-Amp)2SO4H2O, the anions act only as acceptors of hydrogen bonds of 
the type N-H...O and C-H...O (cation...anion) and O-H...O (water...anion). In the structures 2-
AmpHSO4(I) and 2-AmpHSO4(II), protonated anions have a more complex function - they 
are involved not only as the acceptors mentioned above but also act as donors of hydrogen 
bonds of the type O-H...N (anion...cation) in the case of 2-AmpHSO4(I)  and of the type O-
H...O (anion...anion) in the case of 2-AmpHSO4(II). 
 
3.2 Thermal behaviour  
 
Crystals of 2-AmpH2PO3 are stable in air up to a melting point of 163 °C. Subsequent DSC 
recordings showed no thermal effect in the region from -160 °C to 150 °C. Melting of 2-
AmpHSO4 (I) was observed at 154 °C and DSC recordings in the region -160 °C to 135 °C did 
not show any thermal effects and confirmed that there is no phase transition to the 2-AmpHSO4 
(II) phase. This conclusion agrees with the crystal structure determination results – 
cooling/heating of the crystal leads only to small thermal contraction/expansion of the unit cell 
parameters. Unfortunately, due to the minimal number of crystals of 2-AmpHSO4 (II) 
polymorph obtained, a study of the thermal behaviour could not be performed for this phase. 
The melting point of (2-Amp)2SO4H2O was determined (visual detection) to be 186 °C. On the 
other hand, DSC recordings (see Fig. S8, Supplementary material) in the range -160 °C to 180 
°C exhibit several weak exothermic effects at 82 °C (H = 22.4 J/g), 102 °C (H = 13.0 J/g)
