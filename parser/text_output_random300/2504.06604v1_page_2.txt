have leveraged micro-CT images to accelerate the prediction of effective rock properties, improving computational
efficiency [Liu et al., 2023, Ahmad et al., 2023, Chung et al., 2024b,c].
Despite these advantages, three-dimensional CT images present several challenges. First, the resolution may not be
sufficient to capture all pore structures [Blunt, 2017, Saxena et al., 2019a]. As resolution increases, the sample size that
can be imaged decreases. For instance, a 20003-voxel dataset at 1 µm resolution represents a 2 mm3 volume. Given the
fixed total number of voxel, increasing the resolution by reducing the pixel size to 0.5 µm halves the sample size to
1 mm3. Since the studied volume must be at least as large as the representative elementary volume (REV) to derive
meaningful upscaling properties, a coarser resolution is commonly chosen to image a larger sample exceeding the REV
[Yoon and Dewers, 2013, Milani et al., 2016]. Consequently, typical micro-CT scans of rocks have resolutions ranging
from 1 to 20 µm for samples a few to a few tens of millimeters in size [Bazaikin et al., 2017, Blunt, 2017, Saenger and
Madonna, 2011]. However, submicron pores, grain roughness, small throat channels, and microcracks—features that
significantly influence upscaled properties—often remain unobserved in micro-CT images but are detectable at higher
resolutions [Bazaikin et al., 2017]. Second, micro-CT images do not provide explicit geological information. While
grayscale intensity variations allow density-based differentiation between grains and pores, they do not distinguish
mineral compositions [Niu et al., 2020a, Goldfarb et al., 2022]. Additionally, cementation and weathering effects, which
critically impact rock properties [Basu et al., 2009, Cook et al., 2015], are not explicitly visible in CT images . Third,
the computed effective properties are subject to systematic errors due to the aforementioned resolution limitations and
the inability to identify geological information. In particular, these issues can lead to porosity underestimation (by a
factor of 0.5) and permeability overestimation (by a factor of 10) [Saxena et al., 2019a]. Similarly, effective elastic
moduli derived from digital images tend to be stiffer than those measured in laboratory tests [Saxena et al., 2019b].
Additional imaging modalities can help overcome these limitations by providing complementary information. Thin-
section microscope images offer submicron resolution (e.g., 0.65 µm/pixel [Araya-Polo et al., 2020], 0.74 µm/pixel
[Saxena et al., 2017a]) and reveal mineralogy, grain contacts, fine-scale pore structures, and weathering features [Saxena
et al., 2021]. However, thin-section images capture only 2D information, making it difficult to infer the broader 3D rock
microstructure. Data-driven super-resolution techniques have attempted to fuse CT and thin-section data [Niu et al.,
2020b, Liu and Mukerji, 2022], but they often assume that submicron features in thin-section images match those in the
entire CT volume, which may not hold for heterogeneous or anisotropic rocks. If the thin section is not representative
of the full 3D volume, reconstructed 3D features may be misinterpreted. Therefore, before applying unpaired image
fusion techniques, it is essential to verify that the thin-section image is spatially aligned with the 3D CT volume.
A persistent challenge in multimodal imaging is the precise alignment of a 2D thin section within a 3D CT volume.
Manual feature matching is time-consuming, prone to errors, and complicated by uncertainties introduced during
thin section preparation. Figure 1 shows a general procedure for preparing thin-section digital rock images, which
includes multiple steps such as sawing, polishing, and digitizing. Each of these steps introduces potential misalignment,
complicating the precise spatial correlation between the thin section and the original rock sample. Consequently,
accurate registration of thin-section and micro-CT images remains challenging, even with a known rough location,
limiting the effective integration of dual-modality information.
Image registration—which aligns images from different modalities into a single coordinate system—is widely used in
fields such as medical imaging and automatic target recognition [Brown, 1992, Zitova and Flusser, 2003]. In medicine,
for example, physicians frequently combine CT scans (which depict bone structures) with MRI data (which highlight
soft tissues) to track tumor growth or plan treatments, as each modality provides complementary information about the
same anatomical region [Maurer and Fitzpatrick, 1993, Maes et al., 2003]. Similarly, multimodal image registration in
geoscience can improve the accuracy of effective rock properties that align with laboratory measurements by integrating
CT and thin-section data. However, geological applications of image registration remain largely unexplored, particularly
for aligning a 2D thin section within a 3D CT volume, which introduces 3D rotational challenges.
