increase the eﬀective Kondo coupling JK. As a compari-
son, we present the similar calculations for both E0 = −5
and E0 = −3 in Appendix C. It is shown that the critical
Vc,B is reduced steadily by decreasing the f electron level
|E0|. Therefore, the SKS phase is accessible by applying
the interlayer voltage and we expect that the successive
KS transitions can be tuned accordingly.
Implications for the general ﬂat band physics and
strange metallicity. Finally, the strange metallicity as-
sociated with ﬂat bands and Van Hove singularities has
been an important theme in correlated electron systems,
in particular in the graphene-based moire structures and
transition-metal-based kagome lattices. Recently, a uni-
ﬁed framework for understanding the strange metallicity
in these systems has been proposed based on the general
Kondo or Anderson lattices, similar to the heavy fermion
systems[60–65]. In this framework, the f-orbitals come
from the same type of conduction electrons but associ-
ated with much localized Wannier orbitals, or the so-
called compact molecular orbitals representing some lin-
ear superpositions of atomic orbitals for diﬀerent sites
[66–68].
The quantum criticality associated with the
Kondo destruction provides a reasonable mechanism for
the strange metal behavior in these systems.
It is in-
teresting to notice that the ﬂat band discovered in the
present work is due to the hybridization between the
diﬀerent types of electrons, i.e., itinerant orbitals and
purely-localized f orbitals. It exists in the SKS phase
even at half-ﬁlling and develops only in the Kondo gap.
Speciﬁcally, it disappears upon Kondo destruction, re-
sulting in a jump in the Fermi volume or the reconstruc-
tion of the Fermi surface crossing the critical point Vc,B,
violating Luttinger theorem. The strange metallicity is
also associated with the Van Hove singularity precisely
located at the Fermi energy at half-ﬁlling. Therefore, our
results add a new ingredient to a wide context of the ﬂat
band physics and Kondo physics in correlated electron
systems. We expect that the correlated bilayers like the
transition metal-dichalcogenide heterostructures and the
densely f electron doped graphene bilayers are suitable
platforms to observe these fascinating quantum phenom-
ena.

Distance between diﬀerent sites
The heterostructure we are studying consists of a c-
layer and a f-layer, with the same honeycomb lattice.
The c-layer is put on top of the f-layer. The position
vector of any site on the f-layer is denoted as
⃗Rn,η = n1⃗a1 + n2⃗a2 + a0
2 ǫη⃗ex
(A1)
with ǫη = ±1 for η = B/A sublattices, a0 being the
distance between the nearest-neighbor sites, and ⃗a1/2 =

⃗ey. The c-layer is shifted by δx0 = a0δx
along the armchair direction (chosen as the x-axis), with
δx being a dimensionless parameter measuring the rela-
tive shift between the two layers. The position vector of
any site on the c-layer is represented by
⃗rm,η = m1⃗a1 + m2⃗a2 + a0
2 ǫη⃗ex + δx0⃗ex + az⃗ez .
(A2)
In the following, all site-site distances are measured with
respect to a0 which is served as the length unit, so that
δx0 = δx throughout the Appendices.
The distance of a site on the f-layer to another site on
the c-layer is
d⃗rm,η(δx)←⃗Rn,η′
≡|⃗rm,η −⃗Rn,η′|
=|(m1 −n1)⃗a1 + (m2 −n2)⃗a2 + [1

Since the interlayer hybridization matrix elements de-
pend on the relative distance between the sites on both
f-layer and c-layer, we might ﬁx the unit-cell of c-layer
at the origin (namely m = 0) to simplify the expressions.
Therefore, we have (see Fig. 8 for the most relevant hop-
ping terms)

Considering the interlayer hybridization elements de-
cay quickly as the distance increases, we could focus on
the major elements which connecting the nearest neigh-
boring sites and so on within each layers. The ﬁrst one
is the intra-cell hybridization element which is a function
of distance between the two-sites on the two layers

The hybridization elements from the origin to its nearest
neighbors have following terms
