ble singularities of the hadronic tensor (the distributions
Z(p)(ω0, ω2) and Z(p)
l
(ω0, ω2) are indeed linear combi-
nations of Hµν(p, ω)) goes far beyond the scope of this
paper.
Here, we study the σ 7→0 limit of G(p)(σ)
by starting from Eq. (24) and by relying upon (well
motivated) physics assumptions on the contributions to
Z(ω0) coming from the continuum part of the spec-
trum (multi-hadrons states) of H. Indeed, the separation
of the hadronic tensor Hµν(p, ω) into ρµν
¯
fg(p, Ω¯
F G) and
¯Hµν(p, ω) given in Eq. (24) generates a corresponding
separation for the distributions Y(i)(ω0, ω2) and, there-
fore, also for Z(p)(ω0, ω2) and Z(p)
l
(ω0, ω2). This allows
us to write
Z(ω0) = δ(ω0 −ωmin)Zexcl + ¯Z(ω0)
(52)
and, correspondingly, to split the observable G(p)(σ) ac-
cording to
G(p)(σ) = G(p)
excl(σ) + ¯G(p)(σ) ,
(53)
where
G(p)
excl(σ) = Θ(p)
σ (ωmax −ωmin) Zexcl ,
¯G(p)(σ) =

ωmin dω0 Θ(p)
σ (ωmax −ω0) ¯Z(ω0) .
(54)
Our physics motivated6 working assumption concerns
¯Z(ω0), which we shall consider analytical in a neighbor-
hood of ωmax.
Both the kernels Θσ(x) considered in this work (see
Eqs. (76) and (77)) satisfy the following properties

where p and q are generic non-negative integers. Given
our interpretation of the phase-space integration limits
(see section II), a direct consequence of these properties is
that the single-particle contribution G(p)
excl(σ) approaches
its asymptotic limit G(p)
excl(0) = (ωmax −ωmin)pZexcl with
corrections that vanish faster than any power of σ.
The multi-particle contribution ¯G(p)(σ) requires a more
careful analysis, that we start by considering the differ-

between the observables ¯G(p)(σ) at σ > 0 and the asymp-
totic result ¯G(p)(0). This can be rewritten as
¯G(p)(0) =

ωmin dω0 (ωmax −ω0)pθ(ωmax −ω0) ¯Z(ω0) ,
(57)
so that, by using Eq. (51), the first of the properties
listed in Eq. (55) and by making the change of variables
x = (ωmax −ω0)/σ, we have

By relying again on Eq. (55) we now split the integral for
x < 0 and x > 0 and extend the upper limit of integration
up to corrections that vanish faster than any power of σ,

Finally, by changing variable x 7→−x in the second in-
