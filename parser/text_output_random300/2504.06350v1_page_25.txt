CHSH protocol (in quantum theory) vs. BB84. – Alice and Bob share a quantum state of two qubits,
agreeing on specific measurements, while Eve distributes quantum states and holds a purification. A
bound on the achievable secret key rate is derived using a formalism different from that previously
discussed. The CHSH protocol is shown to be equivalent to the BB84 protocol with added classical
preprocessing, having the same robustness to noise. However, BB84 achieves a higher secret key rate at
low error rates but cannot be used for device-independent proofs, as its security becomes compromised
if the Hilbert space dimensionality is unknown.
3.5. CHAIN Protocol – against individual no-signalling attacks
The CHAIN protocol [216] from 2006 considers the Werner state ρ of fig. 2b with P+ = |ϕ+⟩⟨ϕ+|
the maximally entangled state shared by Alice and Bob who randomly and independently measure re-
spectively Ax = Xx for x = 0, 1, 2 with probability q, (1 −q)/2, (1 −q)/2 and By = Xy for y = 0, 1 with
probability q′, 1 −q′. Each binary measurement Xi is defined as
Xi = {|v±
Xi⟩⟨v±
Xi|} with |v±
Xi⟩= |0⟩+ eiθXi |1⟩s.t.

finishing with information reconciliation and privacy amplification.
In Eve’s strategy [216], for each
Aice’s measurement, there might be predetermined (D) output a of x such that p(a|x) = δa,λA(x) as
in Eq. (57) or uniformly random (R) p(a|x) = P
b p(ab|xy) = 1/2 when CHSH is computed as in Eq.
(57). Similarly for Bob. If y = 0 is (D), then all the measurements are (D). Eve’s strategies can be
classified as in Tab. 2 into three sets, according to whether (x, y) = (0, 0) yields predetermined (D) or
uniformly random outcomes (R). For each strategy a bound on ⟨S¯∗⟩and ⟨C⟩is computed, as well as, the
conditional entropies H(A|E), H(B|E) describing Eve’s ignorance on the raw key, and the conditional
mutual information I(A : B|E).

Proof. 1) From Tab. 2, I(B : E) ≤I(A : E) then the privacy amplification goes from Bob to Alice,
thus Csiszar–K¨orner condition becomes r = I(A : B) −I(B : E). The mutual information is I(A : B) =
