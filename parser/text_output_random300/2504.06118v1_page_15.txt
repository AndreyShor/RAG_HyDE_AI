THE CORRELATION PRIOR
The correlation prior used in this work is based on the
Horndeski theory with parameters covering a wide range,
as investigated in [65]. Specifically, the prior is defined as,
C(a, a′) ≡⟨[w(a) −wfid(a)][w(a) −wfid(a′)]⟩
=
p
C(a)C(a′)R(a, a′),
(6)
where C(a) ≡C(a, a) and R(a, a′) is the normalised cor-
relation function thus equals unity for a = a′. The func-
tional form of the correlation prior used in this work is
taken from [65]:
C(a) = 0.05 + 0.8a2,
R(a, a′) = exp
h
−(|ln a −ln a′| /0.3)1.2i
.

DETAILS OF w(z) RECONSTRUCTION
AND INTERPRETATION
A.
MCMC reconstruction of w(z)
The total χ2 minimised in the MCMC process has two
pieces, namely
χ2 = χ2
data + Aχ2
prior,
χ2
prior = DT
wC−1
Π Dw = wT ˜C−1
Π w,
(8)
where Dw = w −wfid = (I −S) w and ˜C−1
Π , the in-
verse modified covariance matrix of the prior, is defined
as ˜C−1
Π ≡(I −S)T C−1
Π (I −S). Matrices I and S are the
identity matrix and the transformation matrix, respec-
tively, and the fiducial model wfid = Sw is calculated by
taking a local average of 5 neighboring w bins through
the transformation matrix S [62]. The factor A balances
the strength between data and prior, and we set A = 1
as a default to obtain the main result in Fig. 3.

Reconstruction of w(z) using a Wiener filter
projection
In order to obtain the data modes without using any
correlation prior, we need to set A = 0. However, this
makes the convergence of MCMC chains impractical. To
overcome this problem, we use a Wiener filter projection.
Suppose a Fisher matrix of w, denoted as Fdata, can
be obtained from a given dataset, and one performs two
MCMC reconstructions to obtain w1 and w2 with two
sets of modified prior covariance matrices ˜C−1
Π,1 and ˜C−1
Π,2,
respectively, then the following relation can be derived
using the formulism of the Wiener filter projection [62]:
w2 =

I + F−1
data ˜C−1
Π,2
−1 
I + F−1
data ˜C−1
Π,1

w1
(9)
where I is the identity matrix.
In practice, we set A = 0.01 to perform a MCMC re-
construction to obtain Cp(A = 0.01), which is the pos-
terior covariance matrix of w, then we can obtain Fdata
via
Fdata = C−1
p (A = 0.01) −0.01C−1
Π .
(10)
The MCMC also returns the reconstructed w, de-
noted as wA=0.01. Given Fdata, w1 = wA=0.01 and
˜C−1
Π,1 = 0.01C−1
Π , one can in principle reconstruct w for
another modified correlation prior by a Wiener filter pro-
jection using Eq. (9).
One interesting special case is the reconstruction w
from data alone, without using any correlation prior. This
is straightforward since wdata can be found by setting
˜C−1
Π,2 = 0, and the covariance matrix for wdata is simply
F−1
data.

PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS
(PCA)
PCA is a widely used tool in cosmology to find uncor-
related eigenmodes by diagonalising the associated (in-
verse) covariance matrix. Specifically,
F = WT ΛW ,
(11)
where F is the inverse covariance matrix, W is the decor-
relation matrix whose rows are the eigenvectors ei(z), and
Λ is a diagonal matrix storing the eigenvalues λi [69]. In
this work, we apply PCA for Fdata and ˜C−1
Π , respectively,
and show the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in Fig. 3.

COVARIANT PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS
ANALYSIS (CPCA)
CPCA is a variant of PCA with nice features. It allows
for finding eigenmodes for both the prior and posterior,
therefore it is much easier to quantify the effective degrees
of freedom in the system, especially when the prior is
complex.
Unlike PCA, the CPCA decomposition is as in [70]:
CΠΨ = CpΨL ,
(12)
where the decomposition matrix Ψ and the diagonal ma-
trix L store the CPCA eigenvectors and eigenvalues, re-
spectively. The CPCA decomposition, Eq. (12), yields
ΨT CpΨ = I,
ΨT CΠΨ = L.
