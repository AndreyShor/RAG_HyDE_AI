Figure 4.22: The total charm PDF, xc+(x, Q2), in the 4FNS at Q = 1.65 GeV (left) and 3FNS (right),
as obtained from the NNPDF4.0 NLO, NNLO, and aN3LO fits without (top) and with (bottom) MHOUs.
Error bands correspond to one sigma PDF uncertainties. Note that in the 3FNS the charm PDF does not
depend on scale.
To this purpose, in Fig. 4.22 we show the total charm PDF, xc+(x, Q2), in the 4FNS at Q =
1.65 GeV and in the 3FNS, as obtained from using NNPDF4.0 NLO, NNLO and aN3LO without
and with MHOUs. Note that in the 3FNS the charm PDF does not depend on scale. Error
bands correspond to one sigma PDF uncertainties. The 4FNS results share the general features
discussed in Section 4.3.2: the perturbative expansion converges nicely, with the aN3LO result
very close to the NNLO. The convergence is further improved by the inclusion of MHOUs, which
move the NNLO yet closer to the aN3LO. The 3FNS result is especially remarkable: whereas the
combination of aN3LO matching with NNLO PDFs, used in Ref. [1] to conservatively estimate
MHOUs, was somewhat unstable, now results display complete stability, and in particular the
NNLO and aN3LO results completely coincide.
In order to assess the impact of MHOUs more clearly, in Fig. 4.23 we compare the total charm
PDF in the 3FNS with and without MHOUs, respectively at NNLO and aN3LO. At NNLO MHOUs
have a small but non-negligible impact on central values, with almost unchanged uncertainty,
but at aN3LO they have essentially no impact, confirming the perturbative convergence of the
result.
We thus proceed to a final re-assessment of the significance of intrinsic charm through the pull,
defined as the central value divided by total uncertainty, using NNPDF4.0MHOU NNLO and
