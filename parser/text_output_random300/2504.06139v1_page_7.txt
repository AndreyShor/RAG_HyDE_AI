By reversible local operations, it is meant that Alice may relabel her input,
x ←x ⊕1, or she may relabel her output conditionally on her input, a ←
a ⊕αx ⊕β, and similarly for Bob. It is easy to see that any vertex of a
given class (local or non-local) can be transformed into any other vertex of
the same class by these operations.
2.1
Depolarization
Demoralization is the act of taking a box which is a mixture of any non-
signalling box and transforming it into a symmetric box, while preserving
the CHSH value.
It consists of generating three maximally random bits α, β, γ and doing
the following substitutions: x →x ⊕α, y →y ⊕β, a →a ⊕βx ⊕αβ ⊕γ and
b →b ⊕αy ⊕γ.
Note that this operation requires three bits of shared randomness between
the two parties for every box they wish to depolarize.

Trivial Communication Complexity
There has been evidence that non-locality helps in the communication com-
plexity of some distributed tasks. See for example [4]. Protocols that make
use of non-locality in the form of quantum entanglement oﬀers advantages
over local protocols, but since quantum non-locality is restricted, it is natural
to ask ourselves if stronger non-locality is more helpful.
Deﬁnition 6. The communication complexity of a function f is trivial if it
can be computed using a single bit of communication per participant.
This is the minimum communication needed to compute any function
which is not itself trivial (i.e. it does not depend on only one of the inputs).
3.1
Two participants
It will be useful to deﬁne the following property.
Most proofs of trivial
communication complexity using non-local boxes try to achieve this property.
Deﬁnition 7. The Boolean function f is distributively computed by Alice
and Bob if they respectively receive x and y and output a and b such that
a ⊕b = f(x, y).
