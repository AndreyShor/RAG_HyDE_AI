A major open question in cosmology is whether both of
these problems could be solved by baryonic physics (e.g. [21–
27]) or dark matter models beyond the Standard Model (e.g.
[28–34]).
Proper modeling of the former, however, is computation-
ally challenging, and while the physics of galaxy formation is
understood in broad terms, many of the underlying baryonic
processes, such as feedback mechanisms, remain poorly con-
strained [35–39]. As such, exploring alternative dark matter
models is further motivated by two primary considerations:
(1) the absence of a viable dark matter candidate within the
Standard Model of particle physics; (2) no direct detection has
been achieved thus far, after a decade of experiments aimed
at detecting either of the two most popular CDM candidates:
WIMPs (LHC), and axions (ADMX, [40]).
From a particle physics perspective, the simplest extension
of the Standard Model is to accommodate a heavy or sterile
neutrino that can explain the mechanism facilitating neutrino
oscillations [41]. Sterile neutrinos can be produced via ac-
tive neutrinos oscillations in the early Universe, as proposed
by [42]. They would be the prototype for Warm Dark Matter
(WDM), an hypothetical thermal relic dark matter particle that
decouples earlier and is more massive than Standard Model
neutrinos, initially proposed in [43–45]. Such a dark matter
candidate has a non-negligible primordial velocity distribu-
tion at the time of decoupling, and can consequently escape
small gravitational perturbations, suppressing structure for-
mation on scales smaller than their free-streaming length, 𝜆fs,
which is inversely proportional to the WDM particle mass.
For WDM particle masses of the order of a few keV, the free-
streaming length roughly corresponds to the size of a dwarf
galaxy. WDM follows the same bottom-up structure formation
as CDM, making it a promising candidate to address small-
scale challenges while preserving the successes of CDM at
larger scales. The most recent constraint from cosmological
analysis on this model excludes thermal relics lighter than 5.7
keV (2𝜎) [46].
For this reason, the interest in a hybrid model that in-
terpolates between CDM-like and WDM cosmology has re-
emerged.
The Cold+Warm Dark Matter (CWDM) model
was first introduced by [47–50].
The model is parame-
terized by the fraction of the warm (lighter) counterpart,
𝑓WDM = ΩWDM/ΩM; and its particle mass 𝑚WDM, which has
the same properties as in a pure WDM cosmology.
In some variants of the production mechanism of sterile
neutrinos, the resulting velocity dispersion of the hypotheti-
cal particle consists of cold and warm components [51, 52].
Within this framework, a structured dark matter sector could
exist, featuring components in the keV and GeV mass regimes,
making sterile neutrinos viable candidates for CWDM [53].
Such a dual-component nature of dark matter has also been
proposed for axions [33], reinforcing the motivation to inves-
tigate CWDM.
The free-streaming property of CWDM can be constrained
observationally from the Lyman-𝛼forest, a powerful cosmo-
logical probe of matter density fluctuations in the weakly non-
linear regime through the high redshift and underdense IGM.
In the past, the Lyman-𝛼forest has been used, combined with
CMB data, to constrain the matter power spectrum (e.g. [54–
56]), nature of dark matter [57–62], and to test physics beyond
the Standard Model using the 3D correlation function to mea-
sure the scale of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (e.g. [63–68]).
At the scales of interest for the dark matter models, the
Lyman-𝛼forest is influenced by two key factors: the ther-
mal evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) (e.g., [69])
and the underlying dark matter density field, which drives
structure formation through gravitational interactions (e.g.,
[46, 70]). Consequently, accurately interpreting observations
of the Lyman-𝛼forest at these scales requires hydrodynamic
simulations to model the complex gas dynamics. These simu-
lations have facilitated detailed comparisons between the struc-
tures predicted by the CDM paradigm and those observed in
the Lyman-𝛼forest down to the Jeans scale ([71]), while also
incorporating the free-streaming properties of dark matter. In
the past, constraints on the mass 𝑚WDM have been obtained by
comparing simulations with QSO data sets of different resolu-
tion and signal-to-noise ratios (S/N). This comparison is usu-
ally done within a Bayesian framework by interpolating in the
parameter space where simulations are available ([58, 60, 72–
74]) , which become unfeasible as the dimensionality of the
inference problem increases.
Instead, surrogate models or
emulators can be used based on Gaussian process interpola-
tion ([75–80]), or a supervised neural network interpolator
([81, 82]), demonstrating significant inference speedup. The
data used to carry out this comparison has included, in in-
creasing order of resolution, the SDSS and the Baryon Oscil-
lation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) (e.g., [60, 83]), X-Shooter
(e.g., [58]) and MIKE (LCO) (e.g. [72]), HIRES (Keck) and
UVES (VLT) (e.g. [46]). The higher-resolution data provides
stronger bounds on 𝑚WDM by probing the small scales where
the suppression occurs.
Beyond pure WDM, [84] first suggested a preference for
𝑓WDM < 0.7 mixed models by reinterpreting Lyman-𝛼forest
and X-ray data in the presence of sterile neutrinos.
Later,
[52] combined the WMAP5 and Lyman-𝛼(SDSS) data to
constrain 𝑓WDM < 0.35 for the minimum mass of their prior
range 𝑚WDM ∼1 keV in the case of thermally decoupled
candidates. [83] found that a mass as light as 𝑚WDM > 0.7 keV
is allowed if 𝑓WDM < 0.15. [85] combined Planck, BAO and
Milky Way satellites data to constrain 𝑓WDM < 0.29 for masses
in the range 1-10keV. [86] used N-body similations and model
the effect of baryons on top to predict allowed mixed models
to which weak lensing and galaxy clustering power spectra
upcoming data will be sensitive to.
In this work, we update previous constraints on CWDM
models using high-𝑧Lyman-𝛼forest measurements that are
sensitive to matter clustering to 2x as small separations as any
previous attempts, 𝑘∼20 ℎMpc−1 [126]; and a set of hy-
drodynamical simulations that include the effect of a heavy
and a light thermal dark matter particle in structure formation
including full gas physics. We compare the synthetic spec-
tra to the data in a Bayesian inference framework. Since the
grid of simulations spans a high-dimensional parameter space,
we efficiently sample the likelihood by implementing a neu-
ral network emulator. We perform a variety of analyses that
incorporate numerical correction due to a fixed resolution of
