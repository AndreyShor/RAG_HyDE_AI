alternative is to smoothly relax the veto as one goes further forward [15, 16]. Two examples
of such an observable are:
TBj = mTje−|yj−Y |,
(1.1)
TCj =
mTj
2 cosh (yj −Y ),
(1.2)
where m2
Tj = m2
j + p2
Tj and Y is the rapidity of the hard system under study (for Drell-
Yan this will be the rapidity of the lepton pair). The structure of the resummation for
colour singlet 0-jet processes with a TB/Cj veto was established in ref. [15]. For the gluon-
fusion Higgs cross section, predictions for the 0-jet cross section with a TB/Cj veto have been
obtained at NLL′ + NLO [16], and NNLL′ + NNLO [17]. Experimentally, the cross-section
differential in TCj has been measured in the H →γγ process [18, 19], and cross-sections
differential in both TBj and TCj were measured in the context of the H →ZZ process [20].
In this paper we focus on obtaining predictions for the Drell-Yan process, pp →Z/γ∗+
X →l+l−+ X, in the presence of a TB/Cj veto. The Drell-Yan process is a valuable
standard candle process in QCD, having high rate and clean experimental signature. For
this process, fixed-order predictions have been obtained up to N3LO for the total cross
section [21, 22] and the rapidity distribution [23], and (for example) resummed predictions
have been obtained for the transverse momentum of the l+l−up to N3LL/N4LL [24–32])
and pTj up to NNLL′ [3, 13, 33], with these predictions being extensively compared to
the experimental data.
A detailed comparison of the predictions for σ(TB/Cj < T cut)
obtained here to data will constitute a further valuable test of our understanding of initial-
state QCD radiation, since TB/Cj vetoes partition the radiation phase space in a rather
different way to pTj (technically, they are SCETI observables whilst pTj is SCETII). In
this paper we obtain predictions at both NLL′ + NLO and NNLL′ + NNLO. We include
the resummation of time-like logarithms in the hard process to all orders [34–36], but do
not perform resummation of logarithms of the jet radius R (studied in refs. [37–39]).
The structure of this paper is as follows. In section 2, the factorisation of the Drell-
Yan cross section with a TB/Cj veto [15, 16] is reviewed, as well as the matching of the
resummed predictions to fixed order.
In section 3 we describe how we set the various
scales in our calculation, and review a procedure to estimate the resummation and fixed
order uncertainties in our predictions, following (for example) ref. [17].
We find that
using this ‘standard’ procedure, the uncertainty bands for the NLL′ + NLO predictions in
particular are rather small, smaller even than the NNLL′ + NNLO bands at very small
T cut. We examine why this is in section 4, and propose an alternative ‘MaxDev’ approach
for estimating the resummation uncertainties that is more conservative and gives more
reliable results. We validate these uncertainty estimates using a simplified version of the
Theory Nuisance Parameter method proposed in ref. [40]. Our results for the Drell-Yan
cross section with a TB/Cj veto are given at NLL′ + NLO and NNLL′ + NNLO in section
5, using the MaxDev approach to estimate the uncertainties. We conclude in section 6.
