to this phenomenon as Josephson topology (JT) and show
that specific lattice symmetries compatible with the junc-
tion can protect a variety of novel JT phases, including
those with higher-order topology.
The central conceptual advance of this work is the
discovery of a topological mapping between 2D π-
junctions and 1D vortex lines, a framework we term the
Josephson-Vortex Correspondence (JVC). Using a
dimensional reduction strategy [33–35], we derive these
JVC relations by coupling a target π-junction with its
complementary counterpart, thereby completing the 2π
phase winding required of a vortex.
Remarkably, we
find that the mapping between Josephson and vortex-
line topological phases is often one-to-one, with excep-
tions only arising in systems where high-fold rotational
symmetries of the vortex tube are geometrically incom-
patible with planar π-junctions. In both situations, the
topological phase can be tuned by varying the chemical
potential µ, with transitions marked by the gap closing
of CdGM states in the vortex, and similarly, by Andreev
states in the junction. We analytically demonstrate this
µ-tunable behavior of Josephson topology using a com-
bination of effective theory and dimensional reduction.
These mapping relations between JT and VLT provide a
powerful and scalable alternative to direct vortex simu-
lations, enabling systematic exploration of vortex phase
diagrams through low-cost π-junction modeling.
As a proof of concept, we numerically evaluate and
benchmark the JVC across several effective model sys-
tems, chosen such that both π-junction and vortex ge-
ometries remain computationally tractable. Our first ex-
ample is a four-band minimal model of a 3D Z2 topo-
logical insulator [36–38], a paradigmatic Fu-Kane sys-
tem with s-wave superconducting pairing. This system
is known to exhibit a Z2-nontrivial VLT at low chemical
potential µ [24, 32], resembling a class-D Kitaev chain
with localized Majorana zero modes [7].
Through π-
junction modeling, we demonstrate that the same sys-
tem hosts a 2D Z2-nontrivial JT over an identical µ
range, thereby providing direct numerical evidence for
the JVC. We further apply our analysis to a supercon-
ducting Dirac semimetal [39], which features a gapless,
rotation-protected nodal vortex phase [40, 41]. In this
case, the corresponding JT phase is found to be quasi-
nodal and Z2 topological, again in agreement with the
JVC framework.
Expanding beyond minimal models, we investigate the
JVC in multi-band systems that more faithfully capture
the complexity of real materials, including a six-band
model of iron-based superconductors and an eight-band
“Dirac octet” model. The former has been successful in
reproducing vortex-bound state phenomenology observed
in LiFeAs [28], while the latter was originally proposed
to describe the low-energy topological bands of certain
superconducting anti-perovskites [42–46]. Using compre-
hensive π-junction simulations, we uncover rich JT phase
diagrams in both models, featuring multiple phases dis-
tinguished by their Bogoliubov–de Gennes (BdG) mirror
Chern numbers and inversion indicators. Applying the
JVC framework, we derive the corresponding VLT phase
diagrams, which show strong agreement with those ob-
tained from direct vortex simulations.
Finally, we turn to the investigation of vortex topolog-
ical physics in two realistic material platforms: (i) 2M-
WS2, a widely regarded Fu-Kane superconductor with
experimentally observed vortex ZBP signals [19], and
(ii) Sr3SnO, an anti-perovskite superconductor that has
been synthesized but remains unexplored from a topolog-
ical perspective [47]. For both compounds, we carry out
density functional theory (DFT) calculations to deter-
mine the normal-state electronic structure and construct
symmetry-preserving Wannier models of the low-energy
bands. Accurately capturing the complex band features
necessitates models with approximately 40 Wannier or-
bitals per lattice site.
Vortex simulations using these
models pose a significant computational challenge: to
avoid finite-size artifacts for a pairing gap on the meV
scale, one would require system sizes on the order of 106
lattice sites, corresponding to a Hilbert space dimension
of O(108). In sharp contrast, the π-junction geometry
involves only O(104) degrees of freedom. This dramatic
reduction in complexity highlights the practical advan-
tage of the JVC framework in enabling ab initio charac-
terization of vortex-line topology.
Notably, our π-junction simulations for 2M-WS2 re-
veal a Z2 nontrivial JT phase at µ = 0. Following JVC,
this numerical result supports a Majorana interpretation
of the vortex ZBPs reported in Refs. [19, 20]. By con-
tinuously varying the chemical potential µ, we construct
a comprehensive JT phase diagram and identify a se-
quence of topological critical points. In particular, there
exists a JT critical point approximately 25 meV below
the Fermi level, below which the JT phase becomes Z2
trivial. Remarkably, this criticality emerges exactly when
the electron pocket at L of the Brillouin zone undergoes
a Lifshitz transition. As such, it originates from physics
beyond the conventional Fu-Kane paradigm, which in the
case of 2M-WS2 is primarily governed by the Z2 topology
associated with the band inversion at the Γ point.
The ab initio JT phase diagram for Sr3SnO similarly
reveals multiple critical points at distinct doping levels.
Our π-junction modeling indicates that the undoped sys-
tem (µ = 0) hosts a nontrivial Z2 JT phase, predicting
a single MZM at the surface vortex core. Upon lowering
the chemical potential, we uncover a JT phase transition
into a state characterized by a BdG mirror Chern num-
ber of 2. This distinguishes Sr3SnO from 2M-WS2 and
points to richer vortex topology. According to the JVC,
this mirror-Chern JT phase corresponds to a novel vor-
tex topological phase with a pair of spatially overlapping,
yet symmetry-protected, decoupled MZMs.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we in-
troduce the notion of Josephson topologies for s-wave
superconductors, classify them under different symme-
tries, and discuss how they correspond to various vortex-
line topologies through the dimensional reduction ap-
