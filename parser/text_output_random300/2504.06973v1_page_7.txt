Fig. 5: Observed and disentangled spectra close to quadrature. Observed TRES spectra with orbital phases ϕ = 0.83 (top) and
ϕ = 0.17 (bottom) are shown as the black solid lines. The disentangled spectral components of the narrow-lined stripped star (dark
blue) and the Be star (orange) are shown, Doppler-shifted by the inferred RVs (noted on the right). The observed spectra are well
reproduced by the sum of both components (green), but are dominated by the contribution of the narrow-lined stripped star. With a
flux contribution of ≈40% (see Sect. 6.1.2) and rotationally broadened absorption lines, the Be star’s contribution to the combined
spectrum is barely visible, even though it is the considerably more massive star.
we used the BSTAR2006 grid based on the model atmosphere
code Tlusty (Lanz & Hubeny 2007). These plane-parallel, hy-
drostatic model atmospheres relax the assumption of local ther-
modynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) and are appropriate for a
wide range of B-type stars. The grid covers effective tempera-
tures in the range 15-30 kK in steps of 1 kK and surface gravities
between 1.75 and 4.75 dex in steps of 0.25 dex. We assumed a
solar composition and a microturbulent velocity of 2 km s−1, a
typical value for B-type dwarfs (Nieva & Simón-Díaz 2011).
When applying BSTAR2006 models to the narrow-lined B
star, the fits approached the lower temperature limit of the grid,
indicating the need for cooler model atmospheres. We therefore
calculated new models in the range 10–15 kK using the non-
LTE Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code (Gräfener et al. 2002;
Hamann & Gräfener 2003; Sander et al. 2015). The models as-
sumed a microturbulent velocity of 10 km/s, typical for B su-
pergiants (Crowther et al. 2006) and synthetic spectra were gen-
erated for stars of effective temperatures 10, 12.5, 13, 14, and
15 kK, and with surface gravity log g between 2.0 and 3.0 with
step sizes of 0.25 dex. Further details on the model assumptions
and setup are provided in Appendix C.
We computed models for solar-like metallicity with two sets
of abundances: one adopting solar values from Asplund et al.
(2021) and another representing "stripped star-like" abundances,
characterized by N enrichment and C and O depletion. The mass
fractions for both compositions are listed in Table C.1, and Fig. 7
compares their corresponding spectra. The most noticeable spec-
tral differences are stronger N lines and weaker O lines, with
slight changes in the Si and Fe lines. Since the stripped star-like
models better reproduced the strong N lines in the narrow-lined
star, we adopted these for the subsequent analysis.
6.1. The narrow-lined stripped B star
Based on observations with the Low Dispersion Survey Spectro-
graph at the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma, Navarro
et al. (2012) classified HIP 15429 as a B5Ib star. Another spec-
trum was obtained by Gaia Collaboration et al. (2023a) with the
HERMES spectrograph to confirm the Gaia DR3 SB1 orbital
solution. The authors confirmed the spectral classification and
interpreted the star as a 4.9 ± 0.2 M⊙blue supergiant with a ra-
dius of 20.16 R⊙, suggesting that it had recently left the main
sequence. The mass estimate was based on a comparison of the
dereddened position of the binary in the colour-magnitude dia-
gram with single star PARSEC (Bressan et al. 2012) evolutionary
tracks. Here, we perform a spectral analysis of the disentangled
spectrum and reevaluate this classification of the narrow-lined
star.
6.1.1. Temperature and surface gravity
The temperature of the narrow-lined star was determined us-
ing the equivalent width (EW) ratios of lines from different
ionisation states. Specifically, we measured the EWs of Si II
(4128, 4131, 6347 Å), Si III (4552, 4568, 4575 Å), Fe II (4584
Å), and Fe III (5074, 5127, 5156 Å) lines. For both observed
and model spectra, we calculated all possible combinations of
EW(Si III)/EW(Si II) and EW(Fe III)/EW(Fe II) using these
lines. By comparing these ratios, we identified the model tem-
perature that best matched the observed values for a given sur-
face gravity. We avoided the commonly used EW ratios He I
4471/Mg II 4481 and He I 4121/Si II 4128-32 as temperature in-
dicators, as the He lines may be influenced by a past mass trans-
fer episode (e.g., Gray & Corbally 2009, Chapter 4.2).
