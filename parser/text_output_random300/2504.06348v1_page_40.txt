This contributes a rescaling factor of 1, given that it is a diagonal operator with maximum diagonal
element 1. We prepare this block encoding using explicit (in the nomenclature of Ref. [75]) rejection
sampling with a uniform reference state. See Fig. 4. However, we structure the arithmetic for rejection
sampling in a way that we avoid having to compute a division to evaluate the argument to the Legendre
polynomial. Specifically, we can prepare a uniform superposition over m = 1 . . . M basis states and
then check the inequalities





M ≥m,
l = 0
(kp1 · kp2)M ≥|kp1||kp2|m,
l = 1
[3(kp1 · kp2)2 −|kp1|2|kp2|2]M ≥2|kp1|2|kp2|2m,
l = 2.
(116)
Rearranging the above inequalities recovers the correct inequality test for the Legendre polynomial.
The arithmetic to prepare the input quantities to the inequality test can be broken down as follows:
(a) Compute kp1 · kp2 and |kp1||kp2| to ancilla registers.
(b) If l = 2, square kp1 · kp2 and |kp1||kp2|.
(c) Prepare a uniform superposition over m = 1 . . . M basis states.
(d) Prepare the right hand side of Eq. (116) by multiplying the m register by |kp1||kp2| if l = 1, and
by 2|kp1|2|kp2|2 if l = 2.
(e) Instantiate a register in computational basis state |M⟩.
(f) Compute the quantity 3(kp1 · kp2)2 −|kp1|2|kp2|2.
(g) Evaluate the left hand side of Eq. (116) by multiplying M by kp1 · kp2 if l = 1 or by 3(kp1 ·
kp2)2 −|kp1|2|kp2|2 if l = 2.
(h) Carry out the inequality test.
(i) Uncompute the arithmetic in the substeps above.
3. We add p1 to the pseudoion momentum P.
4. We swap the system register where p1 is encoded and the ancilla register where p2 is encoded.
5. We subtract p2 from the pseudoion momentum P and (not shown) flag an ancilla qubit with |0⟩if
P + p1 −p2 ∈G, and with |1⟩otherwise.
6. Finally, controlled on ζI, we apply (PREPNL)† on the (now) ancilla register where p1 is encoded.
The costs for each of the steps and substeps above are derived in Appendix E.5 and collated in Table 6. The

We perform Hamiltonian simulation via quantum signal processing (QSP). A summary of the method and
the resource cost in terms of number of calls to the iterate is given below.
