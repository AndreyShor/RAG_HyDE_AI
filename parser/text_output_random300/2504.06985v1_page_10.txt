where we have denoted dim(ri) = u(0)
ri . Note that the first equation of (3.13) is merely the
restriction that the total fermion number, counted by chiralities, is 248.
As mentioned above, if we restrict ourselves to simple algebras the system of linear
conditions is reduced to (3.12) and (3.13), and the equations in (3.10) can be ignored; we
will restrict to this case for the remainder of this draft, for simplicity, and only consider
boundary conditions for M-theory where the boundary gauge algebra is simple. In fact, even
in this case, we will find further vanishing coefficients depending on the explicit algebra under
consideration. For example, for the exceptional algebras there are no genuine fourth-order
Casimir invariants [38] as well as odd-order Casimir (except for E6 that has fifth-order and
ninth-order Casimirs), thus u(3)
ri , u(5)
ri , u(12)
ri
vanish. This simplifies the system (3.12) even
more. On the other hand, for the simple algebras Bn, Cn and Dn there are no odd-order
Casimir invariants, so u(3)
ri
is always zero.
In the general simple case, without further vanishings, we therefore have a system of eight
equations, in as many variables nr1 as there are representations included, plus the coefficient
a. For more than eight representations, there will be infinitely many solutions, and therefore
the system is underdetermined. Furthermore, to any given solution we can add any non-
chiral (and therefore, non-anomalous) spectrum that we wish, and the result will also solve
the system of equations.
This large ambiguity in the space of solutions is unlikely to be physically meaningful, and
we need some way to cut it down. In this note, we will do this by additionally demanding that
all chiral fields must have the same chirality, and that the gauge algebra G contains a single
simple factor, as is the case for the Hoˇrava-Witten E8 solution. While this is a significant
constraint in the space of solutions (and, without supersymmetry, there is no reason why
we could not involve fields with different chiralities), it has the advantage that since the
dimensions of the representations have to add up to 248, the space of potential solutions is
bounded, and as we will see, can be explored fully for some groups. We remark that, if the
restriction of chirality is dropped, then there are additional solutions (we will give one such
example for G2 below), but we have not explored this larger space in detail.
3.1
G2 gauge group
We will first ask the question for the exceptional group G2. This group only has real rep-
resentations, several of which have dimension less than 248. Thus, one might expect several
