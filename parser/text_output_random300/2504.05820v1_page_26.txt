where Vq, Aq are defined in Eq. (1.11) for up and down type quarks, while the PDFs qk, ∆qk
read:

where for each PDF the first arrow indicates the direction of the proton spin and the second the
partonic helicity. In the case of CC, the average the sum W + + W −has exactly the same flavor
decomposition as of the NC but with a different coupling, while for the combination W + −W −
up and down quark types contribute with opposite sign:

where Vui,dj are the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix and the sum is performed in
the first addend on all the active up-types given a down-type quark (CKM columns), and vice
versa in the second case (CKM rows). We have adopted the shorthand notation q± = (q ± ¯q).
The longitudinal structure functions FL, gL are vanishing at O(as). This is known as the Callan-
Gross [44] (or Dicus [45]) relation and follows directly from the quark being a spin-1
2 field,
which cannot absorb a longitudinally polarized vector boson.
Historically, the greater success of the parton model was to predict two major observed features
of the DIS structure functions, the above-mentioned Callan-Gross relation and the so-called
Bjorken scaling [46]. In the limit of Q, ν →∞and at fixed x, the structure functions become
scale independent, i.e. F(x, Q) →F(x); this seemed compatible with the idea that partons
behaves like a free particle only in that limit where are asymptotically free. However, as
explained in the next sections, QCD interactions cause the scaling violation for mid-range Q
as well as deviation from the structure functions sum rules. Before describing how such QCD
correction can be included in the DIS structure functions (Section 1.3.3), let us introduce more
formally the PDFs and their renormalization group equations.
