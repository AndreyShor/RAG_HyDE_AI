which generalize the quantities ML,R, KL,R, and WL,R to the whole interval −∞< x < ∞. We will refer to W(x) as the local
topological invariant and to M(x) as the local topological mass.
In agreement with the bulk boundary correspondence generalization to the nonhermitian case, zero modes on the interval
−∞< x < ∞appear when the topological invariants on the left and on the right of the domain wall are different WL ̸= WR or,
equivalently, when the local topological invariant W(x) changes sign an odd number of times (if |WL −WR| = 1) or an even
number of times (if |WL −WR| = 2) on the interval −∞< x < ∞. The points x∗
i where the local topological invariant changes
must be |x∗
i | ≲w, since the fields become uniform at larger distances, whereby the local topological invariant becomes as well.
One can infer from the bulk-boundary correspondence and its nonhermitian generalization that, in this case, the zero modes will
be localized in correspondence with these points x ≈x∗
i . Analogously, zero modes on the interval 0 ≤x < ∞appear when the
topological invariant on the right WR = W(x →∞) is nonzero. If the local topological invariant W(x) is constant, then the zero
modes will localize at x = 0. However, if the local topological invariant W(x) changes at the points x∗
i , then the zero modes will
localize at the points x ≈x∗
i .
On the other hand, the quantity KL,R determines whether the zero modes shows exponentially damped oscillations (KL,R ̸= 0)
or a simple exponential decay without oscillations (KL,R = 0) at large distances Similarly, the value of the function K(x) will
indicate the presence of oscillations for K(x) ̸= 0 and the absence of oscillations for K(x) = 0 at any given point x.

Examples
In this Section, we show some examples of zero modes in the nonhermitian case in Eqs. (7) and (9). Figure 2 show zero modes
on the interval −∞< x < ∞in the case where the width of the smooth domain wall w is smaller than or comparable with the
characteristic decay lengths ξ, for different choices of the parameters m0,1,2 and v1,2. The exponential decay is visible with the
exception of a small region for |x| < w < ξ: These modes have "short hair", i.e., they are nonfeatureless for |x| ≲w but can be
regarded as featureless for distances |x| ≳w. Figure 3 shows analogous cases, but where the width of the smooth domain wall w
is larger than the characteristic decay lengths ξ. The most noticeable difference is that the exponential decay of the modes is now
visible only at large distances |x| ≳w > ξ: These modes have "long hair", i.e., they are nonfeatureless at finite length scales.
Figures 4 and 5 shows zero modes on the interval 0 ≤x < ∞.
The local features of the zero modes become prominent when w ≫ξ (long hair) and when the field around the domain wall is
large. More remarkably, the zero modes on Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 3(d) and on Fig. 5(d) are localized far away from the center of the
domain wall in correspondence of a point |x∗
1| > ξ where the local topological invariant W(x) changes and the local topological
mass M(x) changes its sign.

which is valid for both featureless and nonfeatureless zero modes. Note that all the quantities on the left hand of Eqs. (30) and (31)
describe the wavefunction at large distances, in principle measurable by spatially-resolved spectroscopies, while the quantities on
the right hand depend on the "bulk" properties of the system, i.e., the dispersion of bulk excitations of the system at large distances
x/w →±∞. Thus, one can design an experiment in which some external parameters are varied and simultaneously measure
the bulk dispersion at large distances and the decay rate and momenta of the zero modes. From these two sets of independent
measures, one can thus obtain the quantities mexp

presence of zero modes is obtained when these quantities satisfy Eq. (30) on an extended range of external parameters.

Topological phases and differential order
We note that a general statement can be made on the maximum number of topologically protected modes and the maximum
number of topologically distinct phases only by looking at the differential order of the Hamiltonian. The order of the differential
