Müller-Bravo et al.: SNe Ia NIR Analysis with PCA
3. Initial selection of supernovae
Despite the relatively large number of SNe Ia with NIR data de-
scribed in Sect. 2, many objects have a limited number of photo-
metric epochs. For this study, we require good data coverage of
the light curves, that is sampling the first and second peaks, as
well as the local minimum between them (we will also refer to
this minimum as ‘valley’).
To have a relatively accurate estimation of the NIR light-
curve shape, a minimum of five epochs are needed: ideally be-
fore first peak, around first peak, around the valley, around sec-
ond peak and after second peak. We fit the SNe Ia light curves
with SNooPy (Burns et al. 2011, 2014) using the max_model
model to help apply this cut (note that these fits are also used
in the analysis in Sect. 6). In this process, four objects are ini-
tially excluded due to failed fits caused by insufficient photo-
metric coverage: SNe 2005ao, 2006E, 2006mq and 2008fx. The
coverage criterium used is to select all the SNe Ia that have at
least one NIR epoch before optical peak and one epoch 20 days
after optical peak, and at least five NIR epochs, on any NIR band,
independently.
In addition, as several SNe Ia have photometry from both
CSP and CfAIR2, we use optical photometry from CSP and
combine the NIR photometry of both surveys to have better cov-
erage. Note that the NIR photometry of these surveys is in very
good agreement, as shown in Friedman et al. (2015).
These minimal selection cuts reduce the initial sample to 160
normal SNe Ia with five NIR epochs on any band and with a
partial coverage of the first and second peaks. Note, however,
that this number is further reduced in the following sections due
to other selection criteria.
4. Rest-frame light curves
To obtain rest-frame light curves, K-corrections (Oke & Sandage
1968) are commonly used. This normally requires knowing the
spectral energy distribution (SED) of the object in question, for
which previously trained templates can be used (e.g. Hsiao et al.
2007). In this work, we follow a similar approach as in Pessi
et al. (2022) and Galbany et al. (2023). The observed photometry
was first fit with SNooPy using the max_model model (as men-
tioned in Sect. 3), which outputs K-corrected, and Milky-Way
dust-extinction corrected photometry. We used version 2.7.0 of
SNooPy that includes the updated NIR SED templates from Lu
et al. (2023). Then, the corrected photometry was fit with PIS-
COLA (version 3.0.0; Müller-Bravo et al. 2022b), a data-driven
light-curve fitter based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR;
Rasmussen & Williams 2006), to produce continuous, rest-frame
light curves. As PISCOLA fits multiple bands at the same time,
information across light curves is used to interpolate the gaps in
the data. Examples of PISCOLA light-curve fits to the corrected
photometry are shown in Fig. 1. Each SN Ia has a different ca-
dence and signal-to-noise, which is clearly propagated into the
fit’s uncertainty.
5. Near-infrared light-curve decomposition
Principal Component Analysis (PCA; Pearson 1901; Hotelling
1933) is a statistical technique for linear transformation of a set
of basis functions into a new coordinate system. The new basis
functions are sorted in terms of the degree to which they describe
of 0.634 mag as described in Table 7 of Hewett et al. (2006), which
is only an approximation.

the variance in the original data. Although PCA is commonly
used for dimensionality reduction, it has several different appli-
cations depending on the goal. In the field of supernovae, PCA
has been used in many different studies (e.g. Cormier & Davis
2011; Galbany 2014; Ishida et al. 2014; He et al. 2018; Shah-
bandeh et al. 2022; Holmbo et al. 2023; Lu et al. 2023; Burrow
et al. 2024). In this work, PCA is used to produce a qualitative
analysis of SNe Ia NIR light curves.
5.1. Light-curve preprocessing
Before applying PCA, a series of steps need to be performed
for producing a sensible analysis. First of all, as PISCOLA
fits do not rely on templates, we visually inspect the rest-
frame light curves to make sure they are well-sampled and have
