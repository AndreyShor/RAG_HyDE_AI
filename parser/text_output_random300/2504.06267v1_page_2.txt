spin lattices suffices to attain a rich set of prethermal re-
sponses.
Model
A two-dimensional square lattice of N Rydberg-
dressed atoms is situated inside a single-mode optical cavity
[71–73], as depicted in Fig. 1(a). In the frame rotating with
the laser pump frequency, the system’s Hamiltonian can be
written as

i and ˆa† (ˆa) are the spin-1/2 operators defined on a
lattice site i and the photon creation (annihilation) operators,
respectively, satisfying the commutation relations

i and [ˆa, ˆa†] = 1. The cavity and atomic frequen-
cies, in this frame, are given by ω0 and ∆, accordingly, with
the latter playing the role of an effective longitudinal field in
the spin language. The summation in P
⟨i,j⟩goes over all the
neighboring lattice sites for each site i.
The cavity photons collectively couple to the atoms with
the strength g, mediating a long-range interaction across the
entire system.
This term can be seen as a self-consistent
transverse field generated by the photon-atoms feedback, in
a two-dimensional quantum Ising model. This part is crucial
for generating nontrivial dynamics since Eq. (1) reduces to a
classical Ising model for g →0. The light-matter interaction
favors uniform spin configurations together with a nonzero ex-
pectation value of the photon operator [72], breaking the Z2
parity symmetry ˆsx →−ˆsx, ˆa →−ˆa (superradiant phase).
This interaction competes with the local Ising-type antiferro-
magnetic interaction of strength λ between spins on neighbor-
ing lattice sites. The latter energetically favors spin configura-
tions with antiparallel z-components on adjacent sites, which
break the lattice translation invariance. The resulting equilib-
rium phase diagram has been explored in [66, 73–75].
We investigate equilibration dynamics of the system by
solving a set of self-consistent and conserving (Kadanoff–
Baym) equations [76, 77], allowing us to capture nonlin-
earities and fluctuations beyond the reach of approximations
based on cumulant expansions [78–86] and semiclassical
methods [87–91], including at the same time effects responsi-
ble for thermalization [34, 92–96]. In order to handle path in-
tegrals for spins, we represent spin degrees of freedom on each
lattice site as bilinears of Majorana fermions [34, 94, 97–101]
(see also [102] for a comprehensive survey of the method-
ologies used). The correlation functions of the photon and
of these auxiliary fermionic degrees of freedom will form the
core of our analysis, providing access to the nonequilibrium
dynamical properties for each degree of freedom. We con-
sider initial states in the tensor product of light and matter
components, |ψ0⟩= |φA, θA⟩⊗|φB, θB⟩⊗|0⟩, where |0⟩denotes
the photon vacuum state, while |φ, θ⟩is the spin coherent state,
parametrized with the azimuthal angle φ and the polar angle θ.
To allow for antiferromagnetic order without breaking spatial
homogeneity, we additionally split the original lattice into two
magnetic sublattices, denoted by the subscripts A and B above.
Our focus is to analyze how competing long- and short-range
interactions can dynamically build correlations starting from
the classical states |ψ0⟩.
Correlation functions and effective temperature
We ex-
plore the dynamics of the model by analyzing statistical cor-
relations and spectral properties of the atomic and photon de-
grees of freedom. For bosons (fermions), the spectral func-
tion ρ corresponds to the expectation value of the commuta-
tor (anti-commutator) of the creation/annihilation operators,
while the statistical function F is given by the connected part
of the expectation value of the anti-commutator (commuta-
tor). The former (ρ) encodes information on the spectral na-
ture of single or collective excitations in the system, while the
symmetric correlation function (F) informs about the statis-
tical distribution (Gibbs or nonequilibrium) of these excita-
tions [103]. In thermal equilibrium, they combine to form a
fluctuation-dissipation relation [104]

which naturally motivates to define the effective tempera-
ture Teff(τ, ω) = ω/{2acoth [2n(τ, ω) + 1]} out of equilibrium
by promoting neq(ω) →n(τ, ω) ≡F(τ, ω)/ρ(τ, ω) −1/2,
ρeq(ω) →ρ(τ, ω) [105–107].
Here, O(τ, ω) denotes the
Fourier transform of O(t, t′) with respect to the relative coor-
dinate s = t −t′, also known as the Wigner transform [77],
while dynamics are in central time τ = (t + t′)/2.
Note
that the fluctuation-dissipation relation (2), as written, applies
to bosonic degrees of freedom; for fermions, one should re-
place the occupation neq(ω) with −neq(ω) and coth(. . .) with
tanh(. . .).
In literature, the above definition of Teff is often applied
to nonequilibrium steady states [34, 108–113], in which case
the effective temperature has a direct operational meaning: by
probing the system via a qubit with frequency ωprobe, the lat-
ter will thermalize to a temperature Teff(ω ≃ωprobe). As it
will be shortly illustrated, however, the notion of a nonequi-
librium effective temperature can be useful even for certain
time-evolving states.
Since the model (1) is non-integrable, a generic ini-
tial state is expected to effectively thermalize such that
n(τ →∞, ω) →neq(ω), with lower-frequency modes tending
to equilibrate faster than higher-frequency modes, which may
still exhibit strong nonthermal features even at late times
[113–116]. This motivates us introducing an effective low-
frequency temperature to characterize the intermediate regime
of the thermalization dynamics [105, 106]. During this regime
the infrared region of the frequency spectrum has already re-
laxed, while the system continues to slowly evolve toward full
equilibrium at higher energies. Importantly, the above defini-
tions allow us to independently extract the effective temper-
atures for the photonic Tph and spin Ts degrees of freedom,
