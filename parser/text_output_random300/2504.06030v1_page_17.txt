( ˙ξ, ˙η) above, converges to the ellipse coshξ = a. A computer simulation of such a process
is shown below.
Semi-Classical Process of (ξ, η) Spiral Orbit
(The line joining the two foci is a cut singularity).
This picture reminds us of the shape of a barred galaxy such as NGC1300 as captured
by the Hubble telescope shown in the picture below.

We ask could this semi-classical system shed some light on the formation of galaxies of
this type as well as galaxies such as the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51a) and the elliptical ring
galaxy AM 0644-741? (See the images below).
