It is important to note that for ma > √2meEcut, the diagrams contributing to the
non-resonant production of ALPs exhibit an infrared divergence at the lower integration
bound smin = m2
a due to the low-energy photon. This could be remedied by including
one-loop corrections to the ALP-lepton vertex, which are, however, beyond the scope of
the present work. We therefore neglect the sub-leading non-resonant production in this
region of parameter space and focus solely on the dominant contribution from resonant
production.

Comparison of E137 with other implementations
In this appendix, we compare our implementation of E137 and the resulting constraints on
the ALP-lepton couplings with previous studies in the literature. In ref. [70], the concurrent
effects of an ALP-photon and ALP-electron coupling were analysed. The authors give the
