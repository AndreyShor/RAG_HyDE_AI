2.1.3. The Pineline framework
As mentioned above, the determination of PDFs from high energy experimental data, requires FK-
tables i.e. a theory map given by Eq. (2.2), made of two main components: a PDF independent
interpolation grid and an evolution operator. The latter are computed with EKO, while the
former have to be produced by different generators in order to cover the full variety of available
processes. For this reason, we have constructed a unique infrastructure, Pineline with the
following targets: standardize the input/output format and make the results reproducible.
The framework adopts PineAPPL as back-end and bridges the output of different generators to
an FK-table. In particular, PineAPPL exposes APIs to different languages: it is natively written
in Rust, but has an API to C/C++, that can be consumed also by a FORTRAN application,
and a Python API. Different grid providers can thus interface directly to PineAPPL when filling
grids. ThePineline architecture is visible in Fig. 2.7. Starting with the experimental data,
