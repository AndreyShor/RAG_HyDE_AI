This represents a square root scaling law that illustrates the relationship between friction
and magnetic field strength. Under the condition of the strong magnetic field, this scaling
law closely matches the direct data obtained from the analytical solution, as shown in
figure 3(a). This also indirectly supports the earlier argument that a strong Lorentz force
reduces the boundary layer thickness. When the magnetic field is strong, the average velocity
gradient of the entire boundary layer is replaced by the velocity gradient at the wall, as

Stuart number is defined as 𝑁= 𝐻𝑎2/𝑅𝑒, where 𝐻𝑎is the Hartmann number. Therefore, it
can be further transformed into 𝛿𝐵/𝐿≈
√
3𝐻𝑎−1. In the present model, the wall is located
under the side layer, instead of the Hartmann layer. This seems to contradict the classical
thickness of the side layer which is O(𝐻𝑎−1/2) (Schercliff 1953; Hunt 1965). In fact, the
Hunt’s model only considered steady flow in a single direction and assumed that the main
velocity remained constant along the flow direction. This resulted in the disappearance of
both transient and convective terms in the N-S equation of Hunt’s model. However, in the
present model, the inertial force cannot be ignored, and the main flow gradient 𝑊of the
velocity affects the boundary layer, so 𝑊is retained in the definition of 𝑁. It results in
different scaling laws for the boundary layer thickness. The present model can be further
expanded. If the direction of the magnetic field is changed to be perpendicular to the wall,
the electrical potential no longer contributes to the Lorentz force. The coefficients of Lorentz
force in momentum equations change from 2 to 1, causing the 𝑁to change to 𝑁/2, ultimately
resulting in the coefficient of boundary layer thickness scaling law becoming
√
6, but the
power of 𝐻𝑎remains at -1. This is consistent with the thickness magnitude of the Hartmann
layer (Hartmann 1937).
