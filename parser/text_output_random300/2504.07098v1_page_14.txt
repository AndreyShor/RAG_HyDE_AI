FIG. 4: Zero modes on the interval 0 ≤x < ∞with a smooth domain wall given by S-shaped, symmetric or asymmetric Pöschl–Teller,
or constant fields m(x) and v(x), and with w ≲ξ. Panels on different rows are as in Fig. 2. Panels on different columns from left to right
correspond to different choices of the parameters m0,1,2 and v1,2 analogous to Fig. 2, giving (a) single mode with exponentially damped
oscillations with nonuniform complex phase on the right side of a smooth domain wall with S-shaped fields m(x) and v(x) with Im(vR) ̸= 0
(nonhermitian), (b) single mode with exponentially damped oscillations with nonuniform complex phase on the right side of a smooth domain
wall with S-shaped field m(x) with a nonzero imaginary component (nonhermitian). (c) single mode with exponentially damped oscillations
with nonuniform complex phase on the right side of a smooth domain wall with asymmetric Pöschl–Teller field m(x) and S-shaped field v(x)
with Im(vR) ̸= 0 (nonhermitian), (d) single mode with exponentially damped oscillations with nonuniform complex phase on the right side of a
smooth domain wall with asymmetric Pöschl–Teller field m(x) with a nonzero imaginary component (nonhermitian).
Appendix A: Formal solutions of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation
We are specifically interested in the cases where the fields m(x) and v(x) are approximately uniform for |x| > w, and present
nonnegligible spatial variations for |x| < w. This setup describes the case of a smooth domain wall between two uniform phases
at x ≪−w and x ≫w, or a sharp domain wall between two uniform phases at x < 0 and x > 0 in the limit w →0. In this
setup, most of the interesting physics behavior is concentrated near the domain wall, and not at large distances. In this spirit, we
map the whole real line −∞< x < ∞into the finite segment 0 < y < 1 with the substitution
y(x) = 1
2 (1 + tanh (x/2w)) =
ex/w
ex/w + 1,
(A1)
where w > 0 is a characteristic length describing the spatial variations of fields, i.e., the width of the smooth domain wall localized
at the origin x = 0. We thus expand the fields as a power series of y, with the assumption that the fields approach their asymptotic
values on the left and right exponentially as
|m(x →∓∞) −mL,R| ∼e−|x|/w,
(A2a)
|v(x →∓∞) −vL,R| ∼e−|x|/w.
