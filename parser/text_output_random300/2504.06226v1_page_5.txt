for the most part, one can bypass the need of knowing
the thermal equilibration regime to distinguish between
candidate states, as we will show in a later section.
Haldane Heirarchy: In full thermal equilibration the
effetive central charge of HH is ceff = 4 (2 + 2 from
lower and higher LLs).
The νi = 2 interface shows
cSN1 = 4, cN1H2 = 4 −2 = 2 and cN1H1 = 2, result-
ing in the transport to be [B,B,B], giving us exponen-
tially suppressed noise. νi = 7/3 contributes a net cen-
tral charge of ceff = 3 (2 + 1 from ν = 2 lower LL and
ν = 1/3 upper LL). So the segments have cSN1 = 4,
cN1H2 = 4 −(2 + 1) = 1 = 2 and cN1H1 = 3 also show-
ing [B,B,B] transport and exponentially suppressed noise.
The 3 filling shows a net central charge ceff = 3, giving
us cSN1 = 3, cN1H2 = 3 −4 = −1 and cN1H1 = 4 this
time resulting in [B,AB,B] transport, which means that
we expect a constant non-zero fano-factor in this situa-
tion.
In partial thermal equilibration HH state only con-
tributes a net central charge ceff = 2 from the higher
LL. At the νi = 7/3 interface, we see cSN1 = 2, cN1H2 =
2 −1 = 1 since only the 1/3 charge mode contributes to
the central charge from lower LL, and cN1H1 = 1 giving
us a net [B,B,B] transport. In the case of the filling 3 in-
terface cSN1 = 1 and cN1H1 = 2 but cN1H2 = 1−2 = −1,
giving us [B,AB,B] transport.
BS-MR (N = 1):
Like HH, the N = 1 state is
also a particle-like state showing a net central charge
ceff = 5/2 in full thermal equilibration (2 integers in
the lower LL and a Majorana fermion in the higher LL).
With the νi = 2 interface we can see that cSN1 = 5/2,
cN1H2 = 5/2 −2 = 1/2, and cN1H1 = 2. Therefore the
behavior of νi = 2 is again [B,B,B], which means the
noise will be exponentially suppressed. Simillary for the
ν = 3 filling we see a completely ballistic transport as
cSN1 = 3, cN1H2 = 1/2 and cN1H1 = 5/2. With νi = 7/3
cSN1 and cN1H2 are ballistic with central charges 5/2 and
3 respectively, but cN1H2 shows anti-ballistic transport
with central charge −1/2 giving us a [B,AB,B] transport
having a constant fano-factor.
Even in the partial thermal equilibration regime, the
overall behavior of the BS-MR state remains the same.
The νi = 2
For νi = 7/3 cSN1 = 1/2, cN1H2 = −1/2 and cN1H1 = 1
giving us a [B,AB,B] which corresponds to a constant
fano-factor. In the case of ν = 3 we see that cSN1 = 1,
cN1H2 = 1/2 and cN1H1 = 1 showing completely ballistic
transport ([B,B,B]) and hence exponentially suppressed
noise.
Anti-RR: The Anti Read-Rezayi state is composed
of two integer modes in the lower Landau levels
and 2 counter-propagating bosonic modes with a Z3
parafermion, contributing a net central charge of ceff =
2 −4/5 = 6/5. In full thermal equilibration, with the
νi = 2 interface we see cSN1 = 6/5 and cN1H1 = 2 but
cN1H2 = 2−4/5−2 = −4/5, giving us [B,AB,B] transport
which translates to a constant fano-factor. Similarly, in
the νi = 7/3 case, we see cSN1 = 6/5 and cN1H1 = 2 with
cN1H2 = 2 −4/5 −3 = −9/5 which is again [B,AB,B].
But in the case of ν = 3 we see a completely ballistic
transport in all three segments ([B,B,B])as cSN1 = 3,
cN1H1 = 9/5 and cN1H2 = 2 −4/5 = 6/5.
In partial equilibration, the effective contribution of
central charge is ceff = −4/5. With νi = 7/3 the ef-
fective central charge is only ceff = 1, so cSN1 = −4/5,
cN1H2 = −4/5 −1 = −9/5 and cN1H1 = 1 resulting in
a [AB,AB,B] transport which also means constant CCC.
And for ν = 3 the net central charge is ceff = 3, which
means cSN1 = 1 and cN1H1 = 9/5 but cN1H2 = −4/5
resulting in constatnt fano-factor.
BS (N = −3): Like the BS-MR (N = 1) state, the
BS state with N = −3, also known as the BS-aPf state,
exhibits two counterpropagating bosonic modes with the
difference of 3 Majorana modes in the upstream direc-
tion (excluding the two lower integer modes).
In full
thermal equilibration, the net central charge contributed
by BS-aPf is ceff = 2 −3/2 = 1/2.
The νi = 2
and νi = 7/3 both show [B,AB,B] transport with cen-
tral charges [1/2, −3/2, 2] and [1/2, −5/2, 3] respectively.
And the ν = 3 shows exponentially suppressed noise with
the three segments having central charges [3, 5/2, 1/2].
In the partial equilibration regime, the effective con-
tribution to central charge by the BS-aPf state is just
ceff = −3/2 as the counter-propagating bosonic modes
equilibrate with each other, and we are left with the
upstream Majorana modes.
Hence, νi
=
7/3 in-
terface now shows [AB,AB,B] behaviour with central
charges [−3/2, −5/2, 1]. Finally the ν = 3 filling shows
[B, B, AB] behaviour with charges [1, 5/2, −3/2].
In the discussion until now, we have not discussed the
partial equilibration cases for any state in the νi = 2 in-
terface. This is because the Fano-Factor computations
in this situation discussed earlier need modification as
the way noise is generated is slightly different.
Effec-
tive contribution of filling fraction and central charge in
partial equilibration regime only come from higher Lan-
dau Levels, since higher and lower Landau Levels are not
allowed to mix completely.
This results in no electric
or thermal conduction in the νi = 2 part of the device.
Therefore no current variation is observed at D1 when
νi = 2 in partial equilibration. D2 will only experience
fluctuation in charges if the edge hosts upstream modes
to carry charge carriers away from the drain. Using this
analysis we observe that F P artial

= F P artial
c
= 0 all the
time. The particle-like states HH and BS (N = 1) host
no upstream modes, therefore F P artial

is zero for them.
To calculate the remaining two FFs one needs to nu-
merically solve Eq. (8) by using the temperature profiles
from Eq. (5b). In the case of non-abelian states hosted
by ν = 5/2, [18] show the non-universal character of zero
frequency noise given by S = c1 −c2

L/leq, where L is
the length of the edge and leq is the charge equilibration
length. Park et al. suggest that the constants c1 and c2
can be estimated by comparing with the current entering
the source and by finding at which values they observe
constant S as L/leq is varied. In this work, we do not
