Proof of Proposition 6.1

Hence it suffices to show that when the cutoff parameters are taken to infinity, the limit of the constant
Cλ,new
A,L,k,b coincides with Tγ defined in (6.1), up to a multiplicative constant. To establish that this is
indeed the case, we rely on Propositions 4.1 and 4.2.
We observe that for any A, L, k ≥0, x ∈[L/2, A + L], and k ∈N, conditional on (Wi)i∈[n], the
function Fλ
k,x−L,L : C(Rd) →R is continuous, bounded, depends on the values of the input field in a
bounded set, and it is such that its set of discontinuities is assigned measure zero by the law of the field
eΥλ on C(Rd). This last fact follows since we fixed λ ∈Λ and from Remark 5.2. Furthermore, as can
be easily verified using the Gaussian tail bound, the field gz
b, introduced in (7.4), satisfies (G1) – (G3)
uniformly over all z ≥0. Therefore, we are in a position to apply Propositions 4.1 and 4.2, from
which we deduce that for any ε > 0, k ≥0, b ≥0 sufficiently large, and u ∈[b1/4, b3/4], it holds that

Furthermore, thanks to Proposition 2.11, it holds that

(7.11)
where, once again, we recall that we omit the subscript λ when writing the field Ψ, since, thanks to
Proposition 2.13, its law does not depend on λ ∈Λ. Therefore, recalling the definition (2.11) of a⋆
and performing a change of variables in the integral over x in the definition (7.8) of Cλ,new
A,L,k,b, we
obtain that

(7.12)
Recalling the definition of the function Fλ
k,x in (7.1) and that of Fλ
k,x,L in (7.9), and using the
dominated convergence theorem along with the monotone convergence theorem, we observe that
taking first the limit as k →∞, then as L →∞and finally as A →∞of the expression on the
right-hand side of (7.12), we conclude that limA,L,k,b→∞Cλ,new
A,L,k,b equals

Therefore, by collecting the previous considerations, using the above identity, and leveraging the
independence between the fields (Wi)i∈[n] and Ψ, as well as the stationarity of the fields (Wi)i∈[n]
implied by (W2), we obtain that
