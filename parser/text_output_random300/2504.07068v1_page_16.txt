Theorem 16 ([16, 17]). Associated to the state ρAR, there are Hilbert spaces C, N and Q and an isometry UKI :
A ֒→CNQ such that:
1. The state ρAR is transformed by UKI as
(UKI⊗11R)ρAR(U †
KI⊗11R)=
X
c
pc|c⟩⟨c|C⊗ωN
c ⊗ρQR
c
=: ωCNQR,
(C1)
where the set of vectors {|c⟩C} form an orthonormal basis for Hilbert space C, and pc is a probability distribution
over c. The states ωN
c and ρQR
c
act on the Hilbert spaces N and Q ⊗R, respectively.
2. For any CPTP map Λ acting on system A which leaves the state ρAR invariant, that is (Λ ⊗idR)ρAR = ρAR,
every associated isometric extension U : A ֒→AE of Λ with the environment system E is of the following form
U = (UKI ⊗11E)†
 X
c
|c⟩⟨c|C ⊗U N
c ⊗11Q
c
!
UKI,
(C2)
where the isometries Uc : N ֒→NE satisfy Tr E[UcωcU †
c ] = ωc for all c. The isometry UKI is unique (up to
trivial change of basis of the Hilbert spaces C, N and Q). Henceforth, we call the isometry UKI and the state
ωCNQR = P
c pc|c⟩⟨c|C ⊗ωN
c ⊗ρQR
c
the Koashi-Imoto (KI) isometry and KI-decomposition of the state ρAR,
respectively.
3. In the particular case of a tripartite system CNQ and a state ωCNQR already in Koashi-Imoto form (C1),
property 2 says the following: For any CPTP map Λ acting on systems CNQ with (Λ ⊗idR)ωCNQR = ωCNQR,
every associated isometric extension U : CNQ ֒→CNQE of Λ with the environment system E is of the form
U =
X
c
|c⟩⟨c|C ⊗U N
c ⊗11Q
c ,
(C3)
where the isometries Uc : N ֒→NE satisfy Tr E[UcωcU †
c ] = ωc for all c.
The sources ρAR and ωCNQR are equivalent in the sense that there are the isometry UKI and the reversal CPTP
map R : CNQ −→A, which reverses the action of the KI isometry, such that:
ωCNQR = (UKI ⊗11R)ρAR(U †
KI ⊗11R),
ρAR = (R ⊗idR)ωCNQR
= (U †
KI ⊗11R)ωCNQR(UKI ⊗11R)Tr [(11CNQ −ΠCNQ)ωCNQ] 1
|A|11,
where ΠCNQ = UKIU †
KI is the projection onto the subspace UKIA ⊂C ⊗N ⊗Q. We note that both these maps are
unital.
