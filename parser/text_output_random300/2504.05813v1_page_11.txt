general, we can define the Lie derivative of Θq = (Θ+, Θ−) along the congruence p = (k+, k−)
as LpΘq = kµ
p ∂µΘq = (Dt + pDr)Θq, where q, p take the values (+1, −1). In terms of the
Misner-Sharp variables, we can write the following general expression,

where we made use of Eq.(2.15) to eliminate the divergences associated with type-II

In this work, we are mainly interested on the identification of type A/B PBH (we
refer the reader to [41] for a more detailed discussion and analysis about the horizon struc-
ture) during the numerical evolution, and therefore for practical purposes we simply clas-
sify the horizons as:
the apparent horizon of a spherically symmetric black hole corre-
sponds to a marginally trapped surface which fulfills Θ+ = 0, Θ−< 0 (which satisfies
U(r∗, t) = −Γ(r∗, t)), the cosmological horizon corresponds to a marginally anti-trapped
surface where Θ−= 0, Θ+ > 0 (which satisfies U(r∗, t) = Γ(r∗, t)) and bifurcated trapping
horizons corresponds to Θ+ = Θ−= 0, which implies that U(r∗, t) = Γ(r∗, t) = 0 and its
formation denotes type B PBH. This means that at the location r∗of the bifurcated trapping
horizon, the Eulerian velocity U vanishes at the same r∗where R′ = 0 is found. In section
5, we will focus on studying the congruence expansion Θ± in the numerical simulations to
identify type A/B PBH.

Numerical methodology
To implement the new approach, we develop a numerical code following the numerical
methodology in [17]. We call this new code SPriBHoS-II (in comparison with SPriBHoS6
from [17]), and we make a basic version publicly available here [55]. In particular, we use
the Pseudo-Spectral Chebyshev Collocation Method to compute the radial derivatives in
Eqs.(2.17)-(2.23), while the time evolution of the equations is carried out using an explicit
fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. The advantage of spectral methods, is that the
error decays exponentially with Ncheb. This is because spectral methods compute derivatives
globally, considering all grid points rather than just the neighboring points.
To learn about spectral methods, we refer the reader to [72], but we provide the main
ideas here, following [17]. Let’s consider a function f(x) and approximate it using Ncheb
Chebyshev polynomials. Then the approximated function is written as,
fNcheb(x) =
Ncheb

where Tk(x) are the Chebyshev polynomial of order k. The coefficients ck, k = 0, 1, ..., Ncheb
are then obtained by solving fNcheb(xk) = f(xk) where xk = cos(kπ/Ncheb). Those points are
6SPriBHoS was the first numerical code publicly available in the literature for spherically symmetric
simulations of PBH formation from the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations with a perfect fluid.
