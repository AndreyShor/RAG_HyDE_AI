As in the previously introduced concepts, in the limit-
ing case of vanishing torsion we recover the notions from
general relativity: the T-commutator reduces to the or-
dinary commutator [X, Y ]µ in that limit.
Last, let us
emphasize that this commutator satisfies the usual Leib-
niz rules under multiplication with a scalar function f,
[f X, Y ]T = f[X, Y ]T −(∂Y f)X ,
[X, f Y ]T = f[X, Y ]T + (∂Xf)Y .

MAIN SETTING
With the notational machinery developed, let us now
define the two-dimensional geometry under consideration
for the remainder of this paper. To that end, will consider
the following metric and torsion coefficients:
ds2 = −ϵdt2 + dx2 ,
T tx
t = τ ,
T tx
x = χ .
(23)
In the above, t and x take values in R. Setting ϵ = +1
allows us to study spacetime, and ϵ = −1 instead renders
the above a purely spatial metric (and in that case we will
change variable names t →y). Initially, we will consider
τ = τ(t, x) and χ = χ(t, x) and will later focus on the case
of constant torsion coefficients, τ = const and χ = const.
Here and in what follows, we will denote derivatives with
respect to t with a dot, and derivatives with respect to x
with a prime. For some function f(t, x),
˙f(t, x) ≡∂tf(t, x) ,
f ′(t, x) ≡∂xf(t, x) .
(24)
In the two-dimensional flat case, in coordinates t and x,
one has eΓλµν = 0 such that Γλµν = Kλµν. The curvature
tensor then is simply
Rµν
ρ
σ
∗= ∂µKρ
νσ −∂νKρ
µσ ,
(25)
where the contribution quadratic in Kλµν vanishes iden-
tically in two dimensions. Hence, constant torsion gives
no contribution to the curvature. The curvature tensor
in two dimensions, even in the presence of torsion, is
uniquely specified by one component. Consistent with
the previous statement, it is proportional to derivatives
of the torsion tensor, and its single unique component is
given by
Rtx
t
x = −τ ′ −ϵ ˙χ = 1
2R ,
(26)
where R = gµνRαµαν is the Ricci scalar. This considera-
tion highlights the fact that even though the background
metric (23) is flat, the presence of torsion generates a
non-trivial spacetime curvature. Mathematically, this is
due to the semidirect product structure of the Poincar´e
group (rotations and translations do not commute, and
therefore the translational field strength, torsion, “talks”
to the rotational field strength, curvature).
For completeness, let us mention that the torsion
square is given by
T µνρT µνρ = 2(τ 2 −ϵχ2) .
(27)
Hence, if τ = χ and ϵ = 1 we arrive at the special case
of null torsion which we shall address separately later.
Let us close this introductory section by embedding the
geometry (23) in Poincar´e gauge gravity, whose vacuum
field equations in our conventions can be written as [28]

In general, the expressions hµνλ and hµνρσ can be further
expanded into irreducible pieces of torsion and curva-
ture, respectively, but we do not proceed along those lines
here since we are interested in the two-dimensional case
wherein torsion and curvature are already irreducible.
Using computer algebra is is straightforward to show
that the above geometry, in the special case of constant
torsion coefficients, corresponds to an exact solution of
the field equations with constant energy-momentum and
spin-angular momentum, who are proportional to the
coupling constant a:

In particular, one recognizes that in case of null torsion
the local energy density vanishes, and for torsion purely
in temporal or spatial direction (that is, if τ0χ0 = 0) the
transverse pressures vanishes. Moreover, the spin density
