2. Compute kp1 · kp2 and |kp1||kp2| to ancilla registers. For the former, we inherit the procedure and
costs from Ref. [29], App. C. Specifically, the cost of computing the dot product is 5
2 ˜n + 3n2 + 4bn.
The cost of calculating |kp1||kp2| is just the cost of a single multiplication, b2, as both multiplicands
have already been computed previously.
3. If l = 2, square kp1 ·kp2 and |kp1||kp2|. The cost of two squarings is b2, using Eq. D37 from Ref. [106].
The inclusion of a single control introduces a complexity linear in b, which we omit.
4. Prepare a uniform superposition over m = 1, . . . , M basis states. We assume that M is a power of two,
and therefore this step has no cost.
5. Prepare the righthand side of Eq. (232) by multiplying the m register by |kp1||kp2| if l = 1 and by
|kp1|2|kp2|2 if l = 2. The correct power is computed for l = 1 and l = 2 given step 3. We therefore
need only a single multiplication, controlled on l ̸= 0. The multiplication has cost b2, and the inclusion
of a single control introduces a complexity linear in b, which we omit.
6. Compute the quantity 3(kp1 ·kp2)2−|kp1|2|kp2|2 to an ancilla register, when l = 2. Note that we don’t
care what is computed to this ancilla register for other values of l, so we can carry out an uncontrolled
evaluation. The subtraction has cost b. Multiplication by the constant 3 has cost 2b.
7. Evaluate the lefthand side of Eq. (232) by multiplying kp1 · kp2 by M if l = 1 or 3(kp1 · kp2)2 −
|kp1|2|kp2|2 by M if l = 2.
Two multiplications has cost 2b2.
The inclusion of a single control
introduces a complexity linear in b, which we omit.
8. Carry out the inequality test. This has cost as given in App. E.5.5.
9. Uncompute the arithmetic in the substeps above.
The total cost of the arithmetic (substeps 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) is
5˜n + 5n2 + 8bn −2nmax(nmax + b) + 21
4 b2 + 13
2 b −6.
(233)
While we could maintain intermediate ancilla registers and uncompute with reduced cost, we make the pes-
simistic assumption that the uncomputation is as expensive as the computation. Note that, as in Sec. E.5.4,
the rejection sampling is strictly with respect to |Pl| rather than Pl. However, we compute Pl, carry out the
inequality test without the sign bit, and then fix up the phase by applying a Pauli Z to the sign bit after
the rejection sampling. We require ancilla registers for (kp1 · kp2)2, |kp1||kp2|, |kp1|2|kp2|2, m|kp1|2|kp2|2,
3(kp1 ·kp2)2 −|kp1|2|kp2|2, and [3(kp1 ·kp2)2 −|kp1|2|kp2|2]M. These have cost 2b, 2b, 3b, 2b+2 and 3b+2,
respectively. The total ancilla count for the arithmetic is therefore 11b + 4.
E.5.7
Nuclear momentum
Sec. 5.1.5 requires that we add to the nuclear momenta P →P+p1−p2. We carry this out with one addition
and one subtraction (which costs the same as an addition). Register |P⟩,is the largest, with ¯n qubits, so we
incur a total cost of 2¯n. Each addition requires ¯n ancillas. We also explicitly flag if P + p1 −p2 ∈G. As
noted in [91], Sec. II D, the carry-out bits from the arithmetic above already encode this overflow (and so
no additional checking is required).
