τ = L/c, since we cannot image inside of the nonlinear
medium. We will see in Section VI techniques to circum-
vent these issues.
V. REVIEW OF THE EXPERIMENTAL PLATFORMS
At the heart of the physical phenomena underlying the
fluid-like behavior of light is the nonlinear response of
the propagation medium. Depending on the experimen-
tal platform, this nonlinearity can have multiple origins.
We will focus on the three most common experimental
platforms: atomic clouds, photorefractive crystals and
thermo-optic liquids.
A. Atomic clouds
Atomic media are well known for their strongly non-
linear response to a near resonance laser field. The field
of nonlinear and quantum optics in hot atomic vapors
is extremely broad (Glorieux et al., 2023) with applica-
tions from magnetometry to quantum memory. While co-
herent excitation with multi-levels and multi-fields could
open exciting perspectives (Lukin et al., 2000), most of
the experimental realizations today focus on single-field
near-resonant excitation. In the following we provide the
derivation of the χ(3) nonlinearity in atomic vapor and
present how to use this system for paraxial fluids of light.
We will follow the example of the D2 line of a rubidium
87 vapor. In the case of atomic vapors, the χ(3) response
is derived from the optical Bloch equations (Glorieux,
2018; Grynberg et al., 2010).
1. χ(3) nonlinearity for a two-level atom
As a first approximation, we will study the case of
a two-level atom. For the rubidium D2 line, these two
levels are the 5S1/2 ground state |g⟩and 5P3/2 excited
state |e⟩. We will note the energy of each level Eg =
ℏωg (resp. Ee = ℏωe) and ωeg = ωe −ωg the resonant
frequency of this transition. The transition is driven by
a monochromatic field polarized along a unit vector u:
E(t) = 1
2Ee−iωtu + c.c.. We write the Hamiltonian of an
atom interacting with the electric field as ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆW,
with ˆH0 the atomic Hamiltonian and ˆW the interaction
Hamiltonian:
ˆH0 = ℏωg |g⟩⟨g| + ℏωe |e⟩⟨e| ∼ℏωeg |e⟩⟨e|
ˆW(t) = −D · E(t) = (d∗|g⟩⟨e| + d |e⟩⟨g|) · E(t)
= ℏ

where D is the dipole operator and we defined the atomic
Hamiltonian up to an energy constant. In Eq. (67), we
have introduced the Rabi frequency Ω= −µegE
ℏ, and the
transition dipole moment µeg = ⟨e| d · u |g⟩. The tran-
sition dipole moment contains the internal structure of
the atom and encapsulates the selection rules depending
on the polarization of the electric field.
We switch to
the interaction picture with respect to the Hamiltonian
ℏω |e⟩⟨e| to eliminate the time dependence of the interac-
tion term, and within the rotating wave approximation,
we obtain:

where ˆLν are the jump operators.
Here, we include a
jump operator to describe spontaneous emission: ˆLsp =
√
Γ |g⟩⟨e|, where Γ is the transition linewidth. We also
include decoherence with ˆLdec = √γ(|e⟩⟨e| −|g⟩⟨g|),
where γ = Γ/2 + γcol, where γcol is the collision rate.
We can now express the medium polarization as:
