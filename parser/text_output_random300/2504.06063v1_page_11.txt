TABLE I. ETMC gauge ensembles used in this work. We give the values of the lattice spacing a, of the spatial lattice extent
L, and of the vector and axial renormalization constants ZV and ZA. The temporal extent of the lattice is always T = 2L.

Figure 3 contributes to the Cabibbo suppressed ¯us chan-
nel.
The quark-disconnected contraction shown in Fig-
ure 4 contributes only to the dominating ¯cs channel. In
the following, as commonly done within the phenomeno-
logical literature on the subject, we shall call this contri-
bution the “weak-annihilation” diagram.
In our mixed-action setup the quark-connected contrac-
tions of Figures 2 and 3 have been computed by employ-
ing the so-called OS discretization of the weak current,
