In the elastic scattering regime the hadron does not break, and the final invariant mass coincides
with M, thus it corresponds to x = 1 limit. On the other hand, the high energy limit is given
by E →∞and thus coincides with x →0. Without loss of generality, we can write the
cross-section, associated to the squared amplitude of the diagram in Fig. 1.1 and representing
the probability of the processes, as

Depending on whether the final-state lepton coincides with the incoming one, we distinguish
between neutral current (NC) processes (i = NC), where the incoming and outgoing leptons
are identical, and charged current (CC) processes (i = CC), where a scattering charged lepton
results in a neutrino in the final state, or vice versa. In the former case we need to sum over
photon γ and Z boson contributions, taking into account also the interference term. Thus, for
i = NC we have 3 different contributions j ∈{γγ, γZ, ZZ} with corresponding normalization:

which are needed to account for the different propagators and coupling constants.
In the CC case only W ± bosons can be exchanged, thus the sum on j is trivial and the

In Eq. (1.20) we have introduced two tensors which describe respectively the lepton-boson
(Lµν
j ) and the hadron-boson (W µν
j ) interactions. As we are dealing with massless leptons and
no QED corrections, the structure of the leptonic tensor is quite simple and fully determined by
the electroweak coupling. It is custom to normalize the different contributions in terms of the
