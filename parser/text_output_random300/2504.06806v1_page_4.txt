Under this approximation, the second term of Eq. 2, describing the ΔG between the 
unfolded states of the two protein sequences, is typically neglected due to the 
difficulty of properly defining and measuring it. However, this approximation might 
not always hold, since, for example, different inter-residue interactions and degrees 
of freedom between wild-type and mutant might persist in the unfolded state. An 
additional contribution might be the difference in free-energy of solvation for the 
amino acids involved in the mutation26. It should also be observed that the ΔΔG 
expression is a difference between two terms, and neglecting one could lead to 
significant deviations from the correct solution. Furthermore, neglecting this second 
term also implicitly means violating the mass-conservation for the process, as Gibbs 
free energy is defined for closed systems where mass is conserved.  
 
Considering the extreme flexibility of the neural-networks in implicitly modeling all 
terms of Eq. 1, the approximation of ΔG between the unfolded states of the two 
protein sequences equal to zero should not affect, in principle, models that explicitly 
incorporate the protein-sequence composition change among their input features 
(e.g. I-mutant19, ACDC-NN20, Stability Oracle21). However, as previously mentioned, 
this approximation  might become relevant for models that do not compensate for it, 
such as most “potential-like” methods. 
 
To address this gap, we propose a novel correction that incorporates “mass balance” 
back into potential-like scoring methods, improving the accuracy of protein stability 
predictions without compromising their usually high computational efficiency. By 
retrofitting these potential-like models with this extra term, which we call mass-
balance correction (MBC), our approach adjusts for a key flaw in the evaluation of 
ΔΔG, significantly enhancing the prediction accuracy without any reparameterization 
of the original model.  
Furthermore, the obtained performance for some of these modified methods are 
comparable, or even better, to those of state-of-the-art models such as Stability 
Oracle, providing a valuable tool for researchers needing rapid stability 
assessments. 
 
Results 
Incorporating Mass-Balance Information as a First Approximation of the 
Unfolded State 
We first evaluated the performance of three different potential-like methods, 
representing three different approaches to ΔΔG calculation, with and without the 
MBC correction. Then we compared them to the results of the DDGun3D22,23
