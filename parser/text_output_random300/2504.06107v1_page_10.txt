can perform similar discussions on the decay behaviors
according to Table IV and Fig. 3.
For the I = 1 cc[nn][nn] states, there is no ground
I[JP ] = 1[0+] state due to symmetry constraints. Mean-
while, the total decay widths of most of states are larger
than 20 MeV, classifying them as relatively broad states.
Among these states, the Hc2[nn]2(5365, 1, 1+) is the nar-
rowest state. Although its decay phase space is larger
than that of Hc2[nn]2(5283, 1, 1+), its total width is only
about 10 MeV. For this state, we have
Γ[Hc2[nn]2(5365, 1, 1+) →ΣcΛc]
Γ[Hc2[nn]2(5365, 1, 1+) →Σ∗cΛc] = 1
2.
(25)
This indicates that the Σ∗
cΛc decay channel is domi-
nant. The narrow width of Hc2[nn]2(5365, 1, 1+) makes its
peak shape significantly distinguishable from the back-
ground.
Therefore, we suggest that experiments scan
the invariant mass spectrum of Σ∗
cΛc in the mass range
of 5300-5400 MeV, with particular attention to the nar-
row peak structure near 5360 MeV. If the peak position
and width observed in the experiment are consistent with
theoretical predictions, and the branching ratio conforms
to the 1:2 ratio, it can be confirmed as the signal of
Hc2[nn]2(5365, 1, 1+).
Moreover, for the Hc2[nn]2(5590, 1, 1+) and Hc2[nn]2
(5586, 1, 1+) states, they are degenerate states, which
have same quantum numbers and similar masses (∆M =
4 MeV). Although they have similar decay phase space,
the total decay width of Hc2[nn]2(5590, 1, 1+) is 33 MeV,
approximately 1.5 times that of Hc2[nn]2(5586, 1, 1+).
And their relative partial decay width ratios are
ΓΣ∗cΣ∗c : ΓΣcΣ∗
c : ΓΣcΣc = 1 : 0.1 : 5,
(26)
and
ΓΣ∗cΣ∗c : ΓΣcΣ∗c : ΓΣcΣc = 25 : 0.5 : 1,
(27)
respectively. Evidently, ΣcΣc and Σ∗
cΣ∗
c are their domi-
nant decay channels, respectively. Although theoretically
we can distinguish them by their total decay widths and
the branching ratios, current experimental detectors still
face great difficulties in distinguishing degenerate states
with a mass difference (∆M) of 4 MeV.
For the cc[ss][ss] subsystem, since it has exactly the
same symmetry constraints as the cc[nn][nn] subsystem
with I = 2, the number of allowed states is also identical.
Due to symmetry constraints, there is no ground I[JP ] =
0[3+] state. Among them, the Hc2[ss]2(6021, 0, 1+) is the
narrowest state whose total width is around 12 MeV,
even though it has more allowed decay channels: ΩcΩc,
Ω∗
cΩc, and Ω∗
cΩ∗
c. Here, we obtain the following relative
ratio of decay widths:
ΓΩ∗cΩ∗c : ΓΩ∗
cΩc : ΓΩcΩc = 3 : 13 : 1.
(28)
Our results show that the Ω∗
cΩc channel is its dominant
decay channel.
Moreover, all the cc[ss][ss] states can
decay into Ω∗
cΩ∗
c final states, and this decay channel
is crucial for identifying cc[ss][ss] states.
Although
theoretical predictions indicate clear signals in the
cc[ss][ss] subsystem,
experimental discovery of this
subsystem still faces significant challenges.
Firstly,
the production probability of the [ss] quark pair in
proton-proton collisions is much lower than that of the
[nn] pair. Additionally, the experimental reconstruction
of its decay final states Ω∗
c and Ωc is relatively complex.
B.
The cc[nn][ns] and cc[ss][sn] subsystems
Next, we discuss the cc[nn][ns] and cc[ss][sn] subsys-
tems. For the cc[nn][ns] subsystem, |[(nn)I=0(ns)I= 1
2 ]
(cc)⟩configuration only couples to I = 1/2 states. On the
contrary, |[(nn)I=1(ns)I= 1
2 ](cc)⟩configuration can cou-
ple to I = 3/2 and I = 1/2 states.
Although color-
spin mixing occurs in two above configuration for the
I = 1/2 states, as can be seen from Table V, the ⟨V SS⟩
is significantly suppressed, resulting in the mixing neg-
ligible.
Thus, the I = 3/2 and I = 1/2 states from
the |[(nn)I=1(ns)I= 1
2 ](cc)⟩configuration would have the
same mass spectra, RMS radii, and decay behaviors. For
these states, they are relatively broad states, and have
many different decay channels. Therefore, there are ob-
stacles to experimentally discovering these states. Their
resonance peaks are prone to be misjudged as continuous
background fluctuations. Thus, we do not recommend
that relevant experiments attempt to reconstruct reso-
nance peaks from these decay final states.
Here, we take the Hc2[nn][ns](5710, 3/2(1/2), 2+) as an
example for discussion. Similar situations also apply to
other states. Its total decay width reaches 56 MeV and
relative partial decay width ratio is:
ΓΣ∗cΞ∗c : ΓΣ∗cΞ′c : ΓΣcΞ∗c : ΓΣcΞ′
c = 7.7 : 1 : 17 : 36, (29)
i.e. ΣcΞ∗
c and ΣcΞ′
c are its dominant decay channels.
According to Fig. 4, for the cc[nn][ns] states with the
configuration |[(nn)I=0(ns)I= 1
2 ](cc)⟩, their masses are
generally lower than those of the states with the con-
figuration |[(nn)I=1(ns)I= 1
2 ](cc)⟩.
This is because the
mass of the scalar diquark [nn] is lower than that of the
vector diquark [nn] with I = 1 and S = 1. Meanwhile,
the total decay widths of |[(nn)I=0(ns)I= 1
2 ](cc)⟩are gen-
erally smaller than those of |[(nn)I=1(ns)I= 1
2 ](cc)⟩, and
the same situation exists in the cc[nn][nn] and cc[nn][ss]
subsystems.
This indicates that compared with other
states, those containing the scalar diquark configuration
have lower masses, stronger internal interactions, nar-
rower total widths, relatively longer lifetimes, and are
more likely to be detected experimentally in the doubly-
charmed hexaquark system.
Moreover,
there exists a relatively narrow state,
Hc2[nn][ns](5482, 1/2, 0+), whose total width is less than
