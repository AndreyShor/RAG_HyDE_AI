Fig. 7. TOA flux changes (panel a) across the transition to superrotation (from 𝐹0 = 0 to 𝐹0 = 4 m.s−1.day−1),
and the decomposition of these changes into radiative forcings (panel b) and feedbacks (panel c) computed
with radiative kernel. Panel a corresponds to the interactive-SST runs, panel b to the fixed-SST simulations
and panel c is the difference between the two. Black curves represent the radiative budgets computed by the
radiation scheme in the model, blue curves are the budgets reconstructed using the radiative kernels, which can
be broken down into the Planck response (yellow curves), specific humidity response (red curves) and lapse-rate
response (green curves). Numerical values given in the legend correspond to the global averages of the various
components.

dominated by the radiative forcing (panel b) in the low-latitudes (between 40◦S and 40◦N) and by
radiative feedbacks at higher latitudes (poleward of 40◦).
To relate these changes in the TOA radiative budget to physical fields, we use radiative kernels
(as described in Section 2c). First, we compare the total radiative budget changes computed using
the kernels (Fig. 7, blue curves) with the changes computed directly from the model outputs (Fig. 7,
black curves). Overall, the meridional structures of the two curves are very similar, though there
are differences due both to the linearization inherent to the kernel method and to the fact that we use
kernels constructed with a different radiation scheme. In particular, the domination of the forcing
and feedback contributions at low and mid-/high-latitudes respectively is even more pronounced
in the radiative kernel budget. In the following, we will embrace this approximation and explain
qualitatively why the low latitudes are dominated by the forcing and the mid- and high-latitudes
