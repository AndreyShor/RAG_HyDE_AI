the allowed constant holonomies.
We take the torus to have periods of length Lµ, µ = 1, 2, 3, 4, where µ, ν runs over the
spacetime dimensions. The gauge fields Aµ are Hermitian traceless N ×N matrices and taken
to obey the boundary conditions (BCS)
Aν(x + Lµˆeµ) = Ωµ(x)Aν(x)Ω−1
µ (x) −iΩµ(x)∂νΩ−1

upon traversing T4 in each direction. The transition functions Ωµ are N ×N unitary matrices,
and ˆeν are unit vectors in the xν direction. The subscript µ in Ωµ indicates that the function
Ωµ does not depend on the coordinate xµ. Then, the compatibility of (2.1) at the corners of
the xµ-xν plane of T4 gives the cocylce condition
Ωµ(x + ˆeνLν) Ων(x) = ei 2πnµν

In order to write the transition functions giving rise to topological charge Q = r/N, we
introduce the k × k matrices Pk and Qk, the shift and clock matrices:
Pk = γk

which satisfy the relation PkQk = ei 2π

ensures that det Qk = 1
and det Pk = 1 (the matrices Pℓand Qℓused below are defined similarly).
To write the SU(N) transition functions, we use a k × ℓblock matrix notation, where
k + ℓ= N. The transition functions now read

where we recall that ω is given by (1.1), Pk (ℓ) and Qk (ℓ) in (2.3), and Ik (Iℓ) denote k × k
(ℓ× ℓ) unit matrices.
The transition functions (2.4) can be explicitly seen to obey the cocycle condition (2.2)
with only nonzero n12 = −r and n34 = 1; hence, the topological charge of the gauge field
