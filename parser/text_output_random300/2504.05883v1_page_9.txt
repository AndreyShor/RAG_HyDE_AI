of uncovered points while minimizing the duplication of work. Finally, Fig. 2(c) offers a top-down view of how the points of
interest have been allocated among the agents for coverage, and Fig. 2(d) indicates the point in time each point was covered.
Next, Fig. 3 shows the proposed approach applied for the task of 3D structural inspection of a real-world building i.e., to a
3D reconstruction of the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) hotel in Singapore. The MBS, consisting of three towers as seen in Fig.
3(a), stands approximately 200m (656 ft) tall. These towers are linked by a 340m (1120 ft) long skybridge as depicted. In this
experiment we randomly selected 35 points (marked as white ◦) from the triangulated surface mesh of the building as illustrated
in Fig. 3(a). Five agents are positioned at the coordinates (125, 10, 5), (115, 10, 5), (20, 20, 5), (80, 80, 5), and (160, 60, 5) for
agents 1 (green), 2 (pink), 3 (blue), 4 (purple), and 5 (orange) respectively. Maintaining the previously discussed setup, Fig.
3(b)(c) display the final executed coverage plans by the five agents achieving full coverage of all points of interest within 15
time-steps. The proposed approach generated collaborative trajectories for optimized coverage with the allocation of points to
agents clearly shown in Fig. 3(d) and the timing of point coverage during the mission shown in Fig. 3(e). We should note here
that, in order to handle obstacle avoidance in such complex, non-convex structures, the object of interest is first decomposed
into several convex sub-regions. This decomposition allows us to utilize the constraints shown in Eq. (5j) in each of those
sub-regions to avoid collisions.
Our next goal is to evaluate the proposed approach’s performance concerning computational complexity as shown in Fig.
4(a)(b), and performance i.e., mission completion time, as depicted in Fig. 4(c), comparing it with other methods. For this
purpose, we have conducted a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation randomly initializing the states of N agents, where N ∈{1, 3, 5, 7},
within the environment E as per the setup described in Sec. VV-A for covering 35 points of interest on the object depicted
in Fig. 2. The first set of experiments measures the average runtime required to solve one iteration of Problem (P1) and
generate a solution, varying the planning horizon’s length and the number of agents, and then comparing these findings with
the centralized approach from [16]. It is important to mention that the computational complexity of a mixed integer program
(MIP), such as Problem (P1), is generally influenced by the number of binary variables. This is because the primary optimization
method for solving MIPs, a branch-and-bound variant [21], [22], constructs a search tree that enumerates potential solutions
systematically. The size of this tree which directly affects computational complexity is determined by the number of integer
and binary variables. Therefore, the primary factor affecting computational complexity, as illustrated in Problem (P1), is the
length of the planning horizon. Conversely, the centralized approach mentioned in [16] also depends on the number of agents
for generating collaborative coverage plans. Figure 4(a) presents the average runtime over 50 MC trials for generating coverage
plans with our distributed approach for a planning horizon of T = 3 time-steps (blue bar) compared to the centralized approach
(gray hatched bar) for scenarios with 1, 3, 5 and 7 agents. As evident from Fig. 4(a), while both approaches are comparable
in runtime for the single agent scenario, the centralized controller’s computational complexity increases exponentially with the
number of agents indicating poor scalability. Conversely, the proposed distributed approach’s performance is not influenced
by the number of agents, maintaining its ability to generate non-myopic collaborative plans efficiently. Similar findings are
depicted in Fig. 4(b) for a planning horizon of T = 6, where the proposed method’s performance is influenced only by the
planning horizon’s length, not by the number of agents.
The subsequent experiment assesses the performance of the proposed approach in terms of mission completion time, i.e.,
the duration required for agents to cover all points of interest. This analysis involved 50 MC trials with N = 5 agents
