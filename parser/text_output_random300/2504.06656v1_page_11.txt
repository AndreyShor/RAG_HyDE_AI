FIG. 9: MLP signal signiﬁcance without applying cuts (a) and with applying cuts (b),
respectively.
30 GeV, ηjet < 2.6, Njet ≥2 and EMissing
T
> 50 GeV are applied on the testing and training
events for the discrimination of signals from the background. From Figure. 5Signal eﬃciency and
background rejection without applying cuts (a) and with applying cuts (b), respectivelyﬁgure.5 we
can see that the signal eﬃciency is increased by applying cuts, while without cuts its value is less.
The highest signal eﬃciency and background rejection are for MLP and BDT classiﬁers. Figure.
