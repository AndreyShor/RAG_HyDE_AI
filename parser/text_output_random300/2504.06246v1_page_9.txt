FLOQUET THEORY APPLIED TO SNS
JUNCTION
To simulate the Josephson junction studied experimen-
tally, we consider an SNS junction of the proximitized
InAs two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) as shown
in Fig. 1(a).
The system is described by the time-
dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian H(t) =

with
H(t) = HNτz + Re[∆(t)]τx −Im[∆(t)]τy,

where

The Pauli matrices σx,y,z and τx,y,z act on the spin
and particle-hole spaces, respectively. The Rashba spin-
orbit coupling is represented by α, and m∗is the effec-
tive mass. The chemical potential µ(y) = µSCΘ(|y| −
WN/2)+µJΘ(WN/2−|y|) has a value µSC in the super-
conducting region and µJ inside the junction. Similarly,
we write the pairing potential as ∆(t) = ∆indΘ(|y| −
WN/2) exp[iΘ(y)ϕ(t)], where ∆ind is the induced gap in
the 2DEG and ϕ(t) = 2eVJt/ℏis the time-dependent
phase difference between the two superconducting leads,
determined by the Josephson voltage VJ across the junc-
tion, as shown in Fig. 3(a).
Since the Hamiltonian is time-periodic with period T =
2π/ω related to the Josephson frequency ω = 2eVJ/ℏ, we
can use the Floquet theory to write the Hamiltonian in
the Fourier harmonic space [10], with matrix elements
given by
HF
mn = −mℏωδmn +
Z T
0
dtei(m−n)ωtH(t),
(5)
where m, n ∈Z. Using Eq. (5) we find that the matrix
representation for the Floquet Hamiltonian in the Fourier
basis labeled by m, n is given by
HF =


V † H0 −mℏω

with H0

V
=
∆indΘ(WN/2−y)(τx +iτy)/2 and V † = ∆indΘ(WN/2−
y)(τx −iτy)/2.
To probe the time-averaged density of states in the
junction, we must diagonalize the Floquet Hamiltonian
numerically.
By using the Floquet theory, we get the
Hamiltonian of Eq. (6), which is dimensionally larger
