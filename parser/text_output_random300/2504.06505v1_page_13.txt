heterogeneous molecular configurations while preserving essential physical symmetries. Although the 
current work focuses on water as a foundational test case, the architecture’s emphasis on scalability lends 
theoretical support for its adaptability to more complicated systems such as biomolecular assemblies. Future 
studies will extend this framework to systems where long-timescale dynamics and structural heterogeneity 
are critical. 
While our numerical example adopts Markovian dynamics with a position-independent friction 
coefficient, the proposed adversarial framework does not impose restrictions on the form of the equation of 
motion, making it inherently adaptable to a wide range of dynamic models.38, 39 For instance, as noted earlier 
it can be extended to incorporate position-dependent diffusion coefficients, enabling the modeling of 
systems with heterogeneous environments. By leveraging trajectory-level optimization, our method refines 
traditional bottom-up CG approaches, ensuring that both thermodynamic and dynamic properties are 
consistently captured. 
In conclusion, the adversarial training approach presented here provides a significant step forward 
in constructing CG models that also preserve the dynamical properties of the underlying atomistic systems 
while also being more computationally efficient than purely AA MD. By integrating adversarial learning 
techniques into bottom-up CG’ing, this framework provides a generalizable and physically grounded 
solution for coarse-graining, thus paving the way for applications to larger and more complex molecular 
systems. Future work will focus on broadening its applicability to the biomolecular and materials science 
domains.
