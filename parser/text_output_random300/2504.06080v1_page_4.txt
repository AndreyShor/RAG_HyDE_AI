interacting ghosts and loop corrections to non-linear BRST transformations, many of
which matter starting from the two-loop level. Another important diﬀerence to previous
works are technical hurdles in the coherent FeynArts implementation of required exotic
quantities such as operators and external ﬁelds with non-vanishing ghost number and
wrong statistics.
The paper is structured as follows. First, in Sec. 2 we deﬁne the model, its group
structure and its continuation to D dimensions in the BMHV scheme. Section 3 then
focuses on the strategy to determine the symmetry breaking and symmetry restoration
and describes the additional complications due to the non-Abelian structure and the
multi-loop level in detail. Section 4 lists the UV divergent two-loop counterterms and
presents the main result of the paper, the complete list of ﬁnite symmetry-restoring
counterterms at the two-loop level. Finally, Sec. 5 presents the conclusions.

Chiral SU(2) model in D dimensions
In this section we specify our model by deﬁning the tree-level Lagrangian and BRST
transformations in DReg as well as some group notation. Throughout the paper we use the
customary notation for Lorentz covariants in the BMHV scheme of the earlier Refs. [20,
21, 23, 26] and the review [17], where in the D = 4 −2ǫ-dimensional space e.g. γµ, γµ, bγµ
denote D, 4- and −2ǫ-dimensional covariants, respectively.
The ǫ-dimensional hatted
covariants are also called evanescent. For the γ-matrices and γ5 we have
γµ = γµ + bγµ,
[γµ, γ5] = 0,
[bγµ, γ5] = 2bγµγ5.

Group notation
Our model has the generic form of a Yang-Mills theory analogously to the one studied
in Ref. [20] at the one-loop level.
For deﬁniteness we ﬁx the gauge group to SU(2),
corresponding to the non-Abelian part of the electroweak SM gauge group.
For the
matter part we include Nf right-handed fermions ψRi collected in one multiplet which
transforms under a fully reducible representation R of SU(2) with generators T a(R)ij ≡
T a
Rij (a ∈{1, . . . , 3}), satisfying the SU(2) algebra [T a(R), T b(R)] = iǫabcT c(R). The
generators are block-diagonal,
T a
R = diag(T a
R1 . . . T a
RM ),
(2.2)
with the blocks corresponding to M irreducible SU(2)-representations Rm (m ∈{1, . . . , M}).
The Nf = PM
m dim(Rm) fermions are grouped accordingly in n-plets (n = dim(Rm)) of
the irreducible representations Rm. The normalization of the generators is given by
TrR(T a
RT b
R) =
X
m
TrRm(T a
RmT b
Rm) =
X
m
S2(Rm)δab ≡
X
R
S2(R)δab.
(2.3)
The SU(2) group has only one Casimir operator per irreducible representation which is
proportional to a unit matrix by Schur’s lemma; hence for the fully reducible represent-
ation it becomes,
(T a
RT a
R)ij = (C2(R))ij = diag(C2(R1), . . . , C2(RM)),
