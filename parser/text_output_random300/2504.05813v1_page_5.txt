We refer the reader to [56] for the details of the derivation. This previous set of equations
is typically used to numerically study PBH formation [13, 17, 51–53]. Let’s now consider a
linear equation of state defined by p = wρ with constant parameter w, being w = 1/3 for a
radiation-dominated Universe. The lapse equation in Eq. (2.13) can be solved analytically
considering A(r →∞, t) = 1 to match with the Friedmann–Lemaˆıtre–Robertson–Walker
(FLRW) background,

where ρb(t) = ρ0(t0/t)2 is the energy density of the FLRW background and ρ0 = 3H2
0/8π is
the initial value at time t = t0, with H0 being the initial Hubble factor defined as H(t) = ˙a/a
and a is the scale factor (see [17] for the analytical solution using the same notation we use
in this work). From Eqs.(2.6)-(2.11), not all time-evolution equations are strictly necessary
for simulating PBH formation. For instance, in [17] only U, R, ρ, M are necessary and B, Γ
are obtained from their definitions using the other variables. However, the divergence term
associated with type-II fluctuations is essentially caused by the time evolution of the energy
density Eq.(2.7) and the function B Eq.(2.11) due to the existence of the term U′/R′. This
is responsible for disrupting the numerical evolution from the beginning, since for type-II
fluctuations, it is true that R′ = 0 at least at one point in r. To address this issue, we define
the term involved in ˙ρ, as an auxiliary variable to absorb the divergent term, i.e.,
K ≡−

This is indeed the trace of the extrinsic curvature K = γijKij with Kij = −Lnγij/2 =
(−∂tγij + Lβγij)/(2A) where L is the Lie-derivative, γij is the spatial metric of Eq.(2.2)
and n is the unit normal vector orthogonal to the hypersurfaces of constant t (Σt), i.e.,
nµ = (1/A, −βi/A). In the comoving threading βi = 0 we simply have Kij = −∂tγij/(2A).
In the case of the Misner-Sharp formalism with the metric of Eq. (2.2), we can easily check
using the definition of the extrinsic curvature that K = −
