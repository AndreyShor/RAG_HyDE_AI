The Path to aN3LO Parton Distributions
Theoretical predictions are obtained using the theory pipeline described in Section 2.1. As
discussed in Section 4.2.2, this pipeline in particular includes a new FONLL implementation,
that differs from the previous one by subleading terms. A further small difference in comparison
to Ref. [109] is the correction of a few minor bugs in the data implementation. The overall
impact of all these changes was assessed in Appendix A of Ref. [11], and was found to be very
limited, so that the new and old implementations can be considered equivalent, and the PDF
sets presented here can be considered the extension to aN3LO of the NNPDF4.0 PDF sets of
Ref. [109].
In addition to the default NNPDF4.0 aN3LO PDF determination, we also present an aN3LO PDF
determination that includes MHOUs on all the theory predictions used in the PDF determination.
This is constructed using the same methodology recently used to produce the NNPDF4.0MHOU
NNLO PDF set in Ref. [6] (see also Section 2.3.3). In order to be able to discuss perturbative
convergence and the impact of MHOUs we will also present a NNPDF4.0MHOU NLO PDF set
constructed using the same methodology, and exactly the same dataset as the default NNPDF4.0
NLO PDF set (which differs from the NNPDF4.0 NNLO dataset).
We first assess the fit quality, then present the PDFs and their uncertainties, and study perturba-
tive convergence and the effect on it of the inclusion of MHOUs. We then specifically study the
impact of aN3LO corrections on intrinsic charm. The comparison of our results to the recent
MSHT20 aN3LO PDFs [303] is reported in Appendix B.
4.3.1. Fit quality
Table 4.3 display the number of data points and the χ2 per data point obtained in the NLO,
NNLO, and aN3LO NNPDF4.0 fits with and without MHOUs. In Table 4.3 the datasets are
grouped according to the process categorization used in Ref. [6]. 4 The value of the total χ2 per
data point is also shown as a function of the perturbative order in Fig. 4.16.
The NLO and NNLO results without MHOUs are obtained using the NLO and NNLO NNPDF4.0
PDF sets [109]. The NNLO result with MHOUs is obtained using the NNPDF4.0MHOU NNLO set
from Ref. [6], while, as already mentioned, the NNPDF4.0MHOU NLO presented here for the
first time uses an identical methodology to NNPDF4.0MHOU NNLO [6], but the same dataset as
NNPDF4.0 NLO [109]. Hence, the datasets with and without MHOU are always the same, but
the NLO and NNLO datasets are not the same but rather follow Ref. [109]. The N3LO dataset
is the same as NNLO. The covariance matrix, whenever needed, is computed as described in
Section 2.2, see also [6, Section 4.1] for more details.
The N3LO predictions are based on the same datasets and kinematic cuts as the NNPDF4.0
NNLO PDF sets, use the theoretical predictions discussed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, and are
supplemented with a IHOU covariance matrix as discussed in Sections 4.1.2 and 4.2.1 and a
