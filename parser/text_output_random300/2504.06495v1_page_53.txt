# Convergence of survival probabilities: Let
P (d)(t, x, ǫ) := P(X(ǫ)
t
̸= −∞| X(ǫ)
0
= x),
P (c)(τ, x, ǫ) := P(Xτ ̸= −∞| X0 = x).
Note that X(ǫ)
t
̸= −∞if and only if the process remains above the barrier up to time t, and
similarly for the continuous-time case. Deﬁne the stopping time:
τ (ǫ) := inf{t ≥0 : X(ǫ)
t
< log(ǫ)},
¯τ (ǫ) := ǫ · τ (ǫ) = inf{τ ≥0 : Y (ǫ)(τ) < log(ǫ)}.
Then P (d)(t, x, ǫ) = P(¯τ (ǫ) > ǫ t | X(ǫ)
0
= x). Since Y (ǫ) ⇒X in the Skorokhod topology and
X has continuous sample paths, the map y 7→inf{τ ≤T : y(τ) < log(ǫ)} is continuous at
almost every path of X. This convergence requires that the initial condition x > log(ǫ) lies
suﬃciently above the barrier. Speciﬁcally, we must assume that
x −log(ǫ) ≫ǫ,
so that the process does not become absorbed immediately in the discrete-time setting, and
the FCLT approximation remains valid over the time interval [0, τ]. The same applies to xa
and xb in the survival probability ratio considered below.
Thus, by the continuous mapping theorem (see Billingsley, 1999, Theorem 13.6; also
Whitt, 2002, Ch. 13), we obtain:
lim
ǫ→0 P (d)(τ/ǫ, x, ǫ) = P (c)(τ, x, ǫ),
for all ﬁxed τ > 0 and x > log(ǫ).
# Taking the limit: Set τ := ǫ t and consider
P (d)(t, xa, ǫ)
P (d)(t, xb, ǫ) = P (d)(τ/ǫ, xa, ǫ)
P (d)(τ/ǫ, xb, ǫ).
By the argument above, this ratio converges to
P (c)(τ,xa,ǫ)
P (c)(τ,xb,ǫ) as ǫ →0.
