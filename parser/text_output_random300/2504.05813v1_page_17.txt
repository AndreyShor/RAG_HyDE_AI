peak value continuously increases and reaches C ≈1, it signifies that a black hole has been
formed7 (see Figs. 2, 3, 4, following the discussion in the previous subsection and Fig.6 in
[75]). To distinguish between type A and type B PBHs, we compute the expansion of the con-
gruences Θ± to identify trapping bifurcated horizons, where Θ±(r∗) = 0, which corresponds
to an evolution leading to a type B PBH. If a trapping horizon is found with Θ+(r∗) = 0
and Θ−(r∗) < 0 without a bifurcated trapping horizon configuration, it corresponds to an
evolution leading to a type A PBH. Our numerical results are shown in Fig. 6.
We have computed the formation thresholds of type A/B PBH within the parameter
range β ∈[1, 5.5] and with a relative resolution of δµc ∼O(10−2 %) (in absolute resolution
δµc ∼O(10−4)). For β < 1, the curvature fluctuation does not satisfy the regularity condi-
tions, as it introduces a sharp, divergent feature in the energy density at the center r = 0.
We discard these profiles, as we consider them physically unrealistic. For β ≳5, we found
that large gradients develop in the dynamics when the fluctuation amplitude is very close
to its threshold. Despite implementing a mesh refinement procedure, the refinement was
insufficient to accurately resolve the dynamics and infer the formation thresholds for type A
PBHs with the same resolution as in other cases. We leave the improvement of this procedure
for future work.
We find that the thresholds µc for both type A (µc,A) / B (µc,B) PBHs decrease as
β increases. Our numerical result for β = 1 is µc,B ≈1.75, which is consistent with the
value inferred in [41]. A notable result is that, within our parameter range for β, we observe
cases where type-II configurations do not collapse into black holes, contrary to expectations.
The transition point that distinguishes the thresholds between the type-I and type-II regions
occurs at β ≈2.5. With the standard Misner-Sharp approach, we would only be able to run
simulations for type-I fluctuations and obtain the thresholds for type A PBH for β < 2.5 (see
for instance Ref.[76], using the numerical code of [16]). However, in our work by using the
7Equivalently, we can also check the lapse function at the origin: If it decreases continuously, a black
hole is expected to be formed. Otherwise, if it decreases and then continuously increases after reaching a
minimum (bouncing), it indicates dispersion of the fluctuation. All criteria we have tested in our simulations
are consistent with each other.
