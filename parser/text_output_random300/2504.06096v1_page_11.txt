Additional information on background sources
As described in the main text, no other background source is expected in the selected
sample aside from those already included: combinatorial and from misidentified Λ →pπ−
decays combined with an additional track. The reason only these background sources can
contribute is due to the extremely small phase space of the decay. The difference between
the Σ+ mass and the sum of the final-state particles masses is 39.8 MeV/c2 [38]. This
implies that very few decays can mimic this final state at the same mass. In particular, the
Σ+ →pπ+π−or Σ+ →Λµ+νµ decays are forbidden by energy conservation. Given the
low energy in the Σ+ →pµ+µ−reaction, no background is expected from meson decays.
For example, the K+ →π+π−π+ and K+ →π+µ−µ+ decay peaks in the invariant mass
of the final state particles, mpµ+µ−, is shifted considerably higher in mass. Higher-mass
mesons would be shifted even more. As far as background from baryon decays is concerned,
where the final-state proton is correctly identified, the Σ+ triplet is the lightest state with
a significant lifetime, hence all other possible background sources will have a mass that is
considerably larger.
Regarding possible residual Λ background, no significant contribution is expected after
the full selection including the Λ veto. The distribution of the pµ−invariant mass in the
pπ−hypothesis is shown in the Supplemental Material [52] for Σ+ →pµ+µ−candidates
in data within a ±6 MeV/c2 window from the Σ+ mass peak, without the Λ veto. The
residual background coming from Λ decays outside of the veto represents only a small tail
distributed along the mpµ+µ−mass, taken into account by the combinatorial background.

Fit to the Σ+ →pµ+µ−invariant mass
The unbinned maximum-likelihood fit to the pµ+µ−invariant mass on the data sample
divided into TOS and TIS samples is reported in Fig. 4.
