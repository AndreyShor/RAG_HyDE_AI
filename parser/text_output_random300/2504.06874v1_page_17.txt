Mechanical manipulation of DWs with an AFM tip 
The AFM tip was operated in a normal tapping mode when scanning forward, but it 
was lifted down by ~ 0.3 µm (lift mode) while scanning backward with the feedback 
loop closed. Such scanning with a certain lift down gave rise to a large lateral force that 
could slide the domain wall [61]. By rotating the scan area, we reversed the tip sliding 
directions. Since the feedback was turned off during backward scanning, the gold on 
the tip apex was unavoidably worn out. Therefore, SNOM images shown in Figs. 4a to 
4c of the main text were scanned by using different tips. 
Computational details 
The DFT calculations were done using Quantum Espresso package [62-63]. For 
structural relaxation, rev-vdW-DF2 functional [64-65] was used to take van der Waals 
interaction into account. After having relaxed structures, band structures and DOS were 
calculated with PBE-GGA [66] functional. We adapted pseudopotentials constructed 
with projector augmented wave (PAW) method using parameters in PSlibrary [67-68]. 
The energy cutoff of the wave functions and charge densities are 80 Ry and 640 Ry, 
respectively. In self-consistent cycles in DFT, k-points are sampled on 𝑁𝑁× 𝑁𝑁× 1 
regular grids where in-plane grids are shifted by half grid, and the convergence is 
checked up to 𝑁𝑁= 264. (See Supplementary Note 1 & Fig. S21) In calculating DOS, 
k-points are sampled in a small region near the K-point in the Brillouin zone (a circular 
region with its area about 0.165% of the Brillouin zone area) to reduce computational 
cost. For the charge distribution analysis, we have calculated the partial Löwdin charge 
for each carbon atom. Here, “the partial” means that the integration over the Brillouin 
zone is limited to the small portion as the DOS calculations, since the important 
contributions are from the region near the K-point. Energy barriers between stacking 
patterns were estimated using nudged elastic band (NEB) method with 13 images on 
the reaction path (See Fig. S22 for some of the images).
