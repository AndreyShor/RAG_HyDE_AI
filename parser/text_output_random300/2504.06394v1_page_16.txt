Figure 6: Comparison of the pressure difference across the cupula as predicted by
COMSOL simulations (markers) and the theoretical prediction from (3.20) (Solid line).
As expected from the results in Section 3.2, depending on the value of 𝜅the deformation
tracks the angular velocity or angular deformation of the forcing (given by (3.19)). The
parameter values used are given in the main text, which correspond to St = 0.0256.

Figure 7: The numerically obtained velocity profiles (blue markers) and theoretical
predictions (black solid curves) from (3.5a) and (3.5b). As 𝜅increases, the velocity profile
ceases to be symmetric around 𝜅≈103. The imposed rotation is given by (3.19), sampled
at 7 different times. Parameter values are the same as in fig. 6.
inertial terms must be retained in the analysis (see §2.4). However, the Stokes number may
also become non-negligible for other reasons — for example, some authors report slightly
thicker semicircular canals (𝑎slightly larger), so that the Stokes number is considerably
larger than expected due to its quadratic dependence on velocity. To this end, in the next
section we consider flows with a finite Stokes number.
