The R trajectory is more tightly conﬁned, commensurate with the 2-body motion seen in
the previous section.

Figure 23. Regular pretzel orbits for FE conditions for the R (blue) and N (red) systems, each run for
120 time steps, with their corresponding 3-particle trajectories z(t) (blue, red, magenta) truncated
at 35 time steps (top: relativistic, bottom: non-relativistic). The collision sequences are AB3 (R) and
A2B3 (N), and differ due to FE initial conditions.
In Figure 25, we display the sensitivity of trajectories to initial conditions. The ﬁsh-like
diagram has an AB6 symbol sequence: two of the particles oscillate quasi-regularly about
each other (shown in the upper z(t) plot), with this pair undergoing larger-amplitude and
lower-frequency oscillations with the third. A slight change in the initial FE conditions
yields the strudel-like ﬁgure on the left. Now, one particle alternates its oscillations with
the other two, maintaining a near-constant amplitude throughout.
By controlling the FM initial conditions, interesting sequences of hex-particle orbits
can be obtained. An example is given in Figure 26, which compares snake-like orbits in the
N (red) and R (blue) systems. These quasi-regular orbits have symbol sequences
n
AiB3
o
.
In both systems, the orbits have two sharp turning points separated by some number n
of bumps. In the N system, these have been shown to exist for arbitrary n [3], and it was
conjectured that the same is true for the R and pN systems [30]. The ﬁgures in the R system
develop an hourglass shape narrowing about λ = 0, and cover a much narrower region in
the ρ direction (note the scale in the bottom sequence of plots). The N orbits, by contrast,
are circumscribed by a cylinder.
The symbol sequence AB3 results in boomerang-like ﬁgures, shown in Figure 27, where
the qualitatively different physics due to relativistic effects is manifest. At low energies
(η = 0.2), the N (red) and R (blue) systems have similar boomerang shapes. However, as η
increases, orbits in the R system develop two distinct turning points at different distances
from the ρ = 0 axis for λ > 0, with symmetric counterparts for λ < 0. This feature is
particularly evident for η = 0.75. A kink at the right-hand-side of the boomerang emerges,
becoming increasingly pronounced with an increasing η. The underlying reason behind
the development of this structure is not clear.
