symmetry of our device and the Floquet formulation,
as reported in [10, 11, 22, 23]. Therefore, we conclude
that our experimental observations are not fully consis-
tent with the behavior predicted by Floquet theory.
In Fig. 4, we examine the density of states as a func-
tion of the in-plane magnetic field B∥. Fig. 4(a)-(d) dis-
play the tunneling spectra as a function of VJ in B∥= 0
mT, 100 mT, 200 mT and 300 mT in the AC Joseph-
son regime.
In Fig. 4(a), when VJ ≥350 µV , IDC
is larger than the critical current of the Al film and
drives the whole system normal, while the Josephson
junction at B∥= 100 mT, 200 mT, and 300 mT is
driven to normal via a larger DC voltage (≥2∆Al) as
mentioned previously. As the in-plane magnetic field in-
creases, ∆Vpair 1(pair 2) decreases as shown in Fig. 4(a)-
(d). Figs. 4(e)-(h) show DOS as a function of VJ and
VB calculated with the aforementioned 3-terminal model
at B∥= 0 mT, 100 mT, 200 mT and 300 mT. The pre-

to ξs = 712 nm. (b) Numerically simulated local density of

dictions of the 3-terminal model match the experimen-
tal data for the corresponding in-plane magnetic fields;
therefore, the decrease in ∆Vpair 1(pair 2) is due to the
closing of the superconducting gap on the SC leads orig-
inating from the Zeeman energy.
At a constant DC current IDC = 1.1 µA, the tunneling
conductance as a function of the in-plane magnetic field is
shown in Fig. 4(i). As the in-plane field and the Zeeman
energy increase, the size of both the first gap bounded
by P1 and P3 and the second gap bounded by P2 and
P4 decreases, as tracked by the decrease of ∆Vpair 1 and
∆Vpair 2 in Fig. 4(i). The spectral gap bounded by P2
and P4 shifts to the more positive voltage, whereas the
first gap is anchored around zero energy. This feature is
due to VJ increasing as B∥increases, as shown in the sup-
plementary material. Tunneling DOS as a function of VJ
and VB at IDC = 1.1 µA calculated from the 3-terminal
model is shown in Fig. 4(j) with blue and red dashed
lines to label P1-P4. Fig. 4(j) captures the key charac-
teristics of the experimental data, further indicating that
the spectral features originate from direct tunneling into
the two proximitized InAs regions.
The effective Landau g-factor extracted from Fig. 4(i)
is approximately 8, which is higher than a previously
reported value for proximitized InAs 2DEG [24].
We
attribute this difference to the destruction of induced
superconductivity by the orbital effect of the in-plane
magnetic field [1, 2, 6, 7]. Indeed, the cross-sectional di-
mensions of our system of width 2WS + WN = 700 nm
and thickness 10 nm, with observed critical field BC =
650 mT, are comparable to a previous study of a similar
heterostructure in which suppression of superconductiv-
ity was attributed to the orbital effect [7].
