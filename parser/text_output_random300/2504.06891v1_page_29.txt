Supplementary Figure 4: Effects of the mixing parametrization and intensity on the seismic
opacity proﬁles (using Models 2, 8, 9). The reference opacity proﬁles are shown by the dashed
line, while plain lines indicate the corresponding seismic opacities. The dashed curves are
almost indistinguishable from each other.
