flow of light without energy dissipation, can also be ob-
served in the linear region of the dispersion, for k‚ä•< kŒæ.
To convince ourselves of this fact, let us recall the Lan-
dau criterion for superfluidity, which defines a critical
speed above which a flow dissipates energy in the form
of density waves. In the case of a transverse flow of the
background fluid at a velocity v, the energy of the el-
ementary wave is shifted by k‚ä•.v due to the Doppler
effect:
‚Ñ¶B(k‚ä•) = k‚ä•.v +
s k2
‚ä•
2k0
2
+ k2
‚ä•|‚àÜn| .
(44)
For the flow to generate density waves, the expres-
sion (44) has to be negative, to be energetically favorable:
‚Ñ¶B(k‚ä•)v=0 + k‚ä•.v < 0.
(45)
As ‚Ñ¶B(k‚ä•)v=0 > 0, this is possible only if k‚ä•.v < 0,
that is if the density wave propagates counter-flow, and if
‚Ñ¶B(k‚ä•)v=0 < |k‚ä•||v| . These conditions define a critical
speed for the background flow above which density waves
are excited:
vc = min
k‚ä•
‚Ñ¶B(k‚ä•)v=0
|k‚ä•|

.
(46)
This is the Landau criterion for superfluidity (Landau,
1941; Leggett, 2001).
If the dispersion is quadratic in
k‚ä•, then vc = 0 and energy will always be dissipated in
the form of density waves. But in the sonic region of the
dispersion, ‚Ñ¶B(k‚ä•) = csk‚ä•and we obtain a finite value
for the critical velocity which is precisely the speed of
sound: vc = cs.
III. WHAT IS THE DIMENSION OF THE SYSTEM?
So far in this review, we have assumed a perfectly
monochromatic laser beam, neglecting the temporal di-
mension and resulting in a 2D+1 description for fluids
of light. This is the approach widely used in the litera-
ture. However, the most comprehensive way to describe
paraxial fluids of light involves considering a full 3D+1
geometry. In this framework, the three spatial dimen-
sions are composed of the transverse coordinates (x, y)
and the physical time coordinate t. In this section, we
derive a 3D+1 evolution equation starting from optics
notations and then mapping it to the BEC language.
A. The role of time: 3D+1 NLSE in nonlinear optics
We consider a laser with a central frequency œâ0, al-
lowing the field envelope E to vary with time: E(r, t) =
1
2E(r, t)ei(k0z‚àíœâ0t) + c.c.. This definition describes well a
pulsed laser, but also applies to continuous wave lasers,
where the linewidth is finite and could be taken into ac-
count with a slowly varying envelope. Actually, adding
this temporal dependency in the envelope describes any
fluctuations of the laser around the carrier frequency at
œâ0. We write the total field E(r, t) in the frequency do-
main:
E(r, œâ) = 1
2E(r, œâ ‚àíœâ0)eik0z + 1
2E(r, œâ + œâ0)e‚àíik0z
(47)
‚âÉ1
2E(r, œâ ‚àíœâ0)eik0z.
(48)
In the second line, we have neglected the term at œâ +
œâ0 since E is supposed to vary slowly compared to the
frequency œâ0. As a result, for frequencies œâ around œâ0,
such that |œâ ‚àíœâ0| ‚â™œâ0, only the first term of Eq. (48)
contributes significantly to the field.
After re-injecting the envelope of Eq. (47) into the
paraxial wave equation (25) and writing k2(œâ)
=
œâ2
c2 ‚Ñú

1 + œá(1)(œâ)

, we find the following equation:
2ik0
‚àÇE
‚àÇz (œâ ‚àíœâ0) = ‚àí‚àá2
‚ä•E(œâ ‚àíœâ0) ‚àí(k2 ‚àík2
0)E(œâ ‚àíœâ0).
(49)
Here, the losses and the nonlinearity, that are not spe-
cific to the introduction of t in the derivation, have been
ignored. However, following the same approach as in Sec-
tion II.B, both could be integrated without difficulties.
As k is typically of the same order as k0 due to the
paraxial approximation, we can approximate k2 ‚àík2
0 ‚âÉ
2k0(k ‚àík0). We then expand k around the carrier fre-
quency œâ0 up to second order:
k(œâ) ‚âÉk(œâ0) + 1

‚àÇœâ

and the group
velocity dispersion D0 = ‚àÇ2k
‚àÇœâ2

Injecting the expansion in Eq. (49) we find:
