[25]. Given the challenges associated with directly measuring venous parameters in clinical settings, mathematical
modeling provides a valuable tool for inferring these values and gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying
physiological mechanisms
As IOP increases, a marked decrease in CRA blood flow is observed, reflecting the restriction of the vascular
supply due to elevated pressure. In contrast, CRV blood flow increases due to augmented resistance in the venous
return pathway (see Fig. 4).
The simulation results, reported in Table 5, indicate a clear trend of decreasing CRA blood flow and increasing
CRV blood flow as IOP rises. Despite these variations, the other cardiovascular parameters at a systemic level, such
as SP/DP, EDV/ESV, and CO, remain largely unaffected by changes in IOP, as expected.

Simulation B: effect of left ventricle compliance reduction on the Eye2Heart model.
Simulation B focused on the impact of reducing LVc, adjusted by 10%, 30%, and 50%. This change was modeled by
altering the elastance scaling (ELS) parameter, which reflects the ability of the left ventricle to stretch and contract
during the cardiac cycle. This simulation setup builds upon the work of [35], which primarily investigated cardiac
