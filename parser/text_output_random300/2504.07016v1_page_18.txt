where ρ0 is the hemisphere solution; then, ∇ρ0 = (∂θρ0, ∂ϕρ0) = 0. On the LHS we have our
boundary data: second linearized area perturbations, i.e.
second order small changes in area
perturbations when the boundary disk is slightly deformed so that the deformation depends on
two parameters.
In the RHS integral we have terms containing derivatives of the Lagrangian
and solutions to the first and second linearized minimal surface equation in pure AdS, vi and w
respectively. The functions vi can be chosen to be Hubeny’s first order solutions
ul(θ, ϕ) = tanl(θ/2)(1 + l cos θ)eilϕ ,
(4.8)
whereas for w we do not have explicit solutions ready at hand. Therefore we need to first solve the
second linearized minimal surface equation, which reads (see Appendix B)

The form of the LHS is identical to the first linearization of the minimal surface equation, but now
the first order solutions appear on the RHS as a source so that the equation becomes inhomogeneous.
Notice that if we have a solution w to the inhomogeneous equation, then also w + v solves the
inhomogeneous equation when v is a solution to the homogeneous equation, i.e., a solution to the
first linearized minimal surface equation (e.g., one of Hubeny’s solutions).
Remarkably, one can verify that given two first order solutions uk, ul on the RHS as a source,
one solution to the second linearized equation is
w = ρ−1
0 ukul .
(4.10)
Since the first order solutions satisfy the homogeneous equation, we are free to add any Hubeny’s
solution uj to the second order solution
w = ρ−1
0 ukul + uj .

For simplicity, we only consider second order solutions of the form (4.10). With these choices of
linearized solutions, the integral identity becomes
