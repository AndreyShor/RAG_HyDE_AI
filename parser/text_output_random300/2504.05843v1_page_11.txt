The analysis of the second integral J2,2 via intersection theory is strictly analogous, to the extent that we
can copy down the basis (61) with the sole replacement
p9 →˜p9 = −q r + q r2 + z ¯z −r z ¯z + r s t −r s t z −r s t ¯z + r s t z ¯z ,
(64)
the twist factor w being given by the non-integer part of the powers of the rational factors in (59) supple-
mented by qρsρ. The computations become more cumbersome because of the fifth regulator parameter; most
prominently the inversion of the fourth level intersection matrix Cr takes some effort.
In this case, too, a Laurent expansion in terms of the regulator parameters arises, and non-surprisingly
there is a pole, albeit in β′ = −α + β + γ. So how can the right components of this series be selected?
To organise the polylogarithm level 4 part in terms of an independent set of fourth order monomials and
fith order monomials over −α + β + γ we may change to the parameters α, β′, γ, δ with the ensuing change
∂α →∂α −∂β′ ,
∂β →∂β′ ,
∂γ →∂γ + ∂β′ ,
∂δ →∂δ
(65)
which can be used to extract the part of the pure function multiplying αβγδ from the monomials without
denominator in the basis with β′; alternatively we just expand these monomials in terms of the original
variables. The action of the derivatives on the fifth order monomials over β′ would remain to be defined; if we
do not Taylor expand in the original variables none of the generated terms is a pure number, suggesting these
can simply be discarded.
The problem looks slightly more well-defined using the integral operators
O[x, m] =
I
dx
2πi xm+1
(66)
to extract the m-th power of any parameter. On the fourth order monomials without denominator this is
obviously equivalent. Importantly, on all αlγmδn/(β −α + γ), l, m, n ≥0, l + m + n = 5 present in J2,2 we
do obtain zero independently of the order of the operations. In fact, out of all 21 possible terms with the
composite singularity (by construction, there is no β in the numerator) only
δ
β −α + γ {α4, α3 γ, α γ3, γ4}
(67)
are not annihilated by all sequences of the operators {O[α, 1], O[β, 1], O[γ, 1], O[δ, 1]}, but these structures
are absent.
In the same vein, the application of {O[α, 2], O[γ, 1], O[δ, 1]} annihilates all 21 structures in
any sequence of the operations, while {O[β, 2], O[γ, 1], O[δ, 1]} unanimously sends (67) to {−3, −1, 0, 0} for
any sequence of the integral operators and annihilates all others. In conclusion, in the problem at hand our
intuition of only looking at the regular monomials is justified. The point will clearly deserve attention in future
applications with several singularities like β −α + γ involving the same parameters.
Denoting the pure function multiplying a monomial as [αi βj γk δl],
[α β γ δ]
→
[α β′ γ δ] + 2 [α (β′)2 δ] −2 [(β′)2 γ δ] −6 [(β′)3 δ] ,
(68)
[α2 γ δ]
→
[α2 γ δ] + [α2 β′ δ] −2 [α (β′)2 δ] + 3 [(β′)3 δ] −[α β′ γ δ] + [(β′)2 γ δ] ,
(69)
[β2 γ δ]
→
[(β′)2 γ δ] + 3 [(β′)3 δ] .
(70)
Furthermore, O[α, 2] O[γ, 1] O[δ, 1] and O[β, 2] O[γ, 1] O[δ, 1] do extract the same result from J2,2 despite of the
different appearance of (69) and (70). For simplicity, we opt for the latter. Note that the original differential
operator 1/2(∂β)2 in (55) gives 1 on β2 and so does O[β, 2]. To match the differentiation (∂2
β/2 −∂α∂β)∂γ ∂δ
we thus have to take the difference of (70) and (68) which means to build the linear combination
−[α β′ γ δ] −2 [α (β′)2 δ] + 3 [(β′)2 γ δ] + 9 [(β′)3 δ]
(71)
of components of uβvδJ2,2. Subtracting the same with u ↔v (ie. the ψ[−z6]2 −ψ′[−z6] terms in (50)) and
adding in I2,1 we reproduce the analytic result for the double box (5) up to cuts, as comparing the respective
symbols shows.
Last, unphysical components of J2,2 — in particular those with higher positive powers of γ, δ — may
contain the letters 1 −u, 1 −v in their symbol, but those in formulae (68), (69), (70) only comprise {z, 1 −
z, ¯z, 1 −¯z, z −¯z}. We include the function from (71) and its symbol in the ancillary file as well.
