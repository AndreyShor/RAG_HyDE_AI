where ϵ(k) = k mod 2. At this point, we should stress that in order to capture non-perturbative
contributions, the resolvent should be of a trans-series form. However, the ansatz above only
captures the perturbative part. Of course, we could extend it by adding contributions that are
exponentially suppressed by powers of e−2πB, but the inverse Laplace transform would mix non-
perturbative orders, making the analysis very complicated. Instead, we borrow results from the
non-perturbative solution of the O(3) model [16] and reinstate the non-perturbative corrections
in Section 4. Thus in this section we calculate ϕℓonly up to the non-perturbative corrections.
The comparison between the bulk and edge regions is done for the inverse Laplace transform
of the resolvent:

In the bulk region, we expand (10) in powers of small z and apply the inverse Laplace transform
to each term of the expansion. After massaging the resulting expressions, we obtain the following
result for the resolvent in the bulk region:

which now takes a similar form as the one worked out for the O(3) model in [14]. Note that the
first sum in (12) corresponds to the explicitly known leading order term −2π
√
x2 −B2 in (10).
We can bring this term to a form, that resembles the second sum in (12) and finally write the
inverse Laplace transform of the resolvent in the bulk region as

Here we introduced the generalised coefficients ˆc. The first term of (12) is captured by extending
the sums to include n + j = −1 with the coefficients ˆc−1,0,0 = −2π and ˆc−1,a,b = 0 for a ̸= 0 or
b ̸= 0.
Edge region.
In the edge region, the resolvent can be parametrized based on the leading order
Wiener–Hopf type solution of the integral equation [11] as
