Solutions with an unrestricted Green-Schwarz factorization
The search for end-of-the-world branes of M-theory requires a matter content that is heavily
constrained by the bulk anomaly inflow.
As we saw in Section 3, the anomaly polyno-
mial of the matter content must admit a specific Green-Schwarz factorization; otherwise the
bulk-boundary system cannot be consistently defined. However, while exploring boundary
conditions for M-theory with gauge group G2, we found certain spectra whose anomaly poly-
nomials satisfy a Green-Schwarz factorization, which however is inconsistent with M-theory
anomnaly inflow. In this Appendix, we provide a table with a summary of these anomaly
polynomials that cannot be embedded within M-theory.
