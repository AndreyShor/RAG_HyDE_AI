proposed method. ESTF is constructed using a spatiotemporal Transformer,
whereas our approach is a novel multi-modal visual model based on heat con-
duction. We randomly select 10 categories from the HARDVS 2.0 dataset, and
the feature clustering performance of our method is clearly superior to that
of ESTF. This result further highlights the effectiveness and robustness of our
proposed multi-modal HCO model.
• Activation Maps on HARDVS 2.0 Dataset.
As presented in Fig. 9,
we provide the heatmaps of the algorithm’s activation to demonstrate the
attention effect of our method on human activities, where the dark blue regions
highlight the areas of the image that the algorithm focuses on the most. It is
evident that on the proposed HARDVS 2.0 dataset, our method can accurately
