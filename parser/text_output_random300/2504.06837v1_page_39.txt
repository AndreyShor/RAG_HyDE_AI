which by integrating in time leads to
E(ρε,σ(t)) −E(ρε,σ(s)) =

⟨∇log(ρε,σ(r)/ω), f ε(r)⟩+ ⟨Γ log(ρε,σ(r)/w), jε(r)⟩dr.
Here, we have used the chain rule with the nice test function ∇log(ρε,σ(r)/w). In particular,
by Legendre duality we obtain
E(ρε,σ(t)) −E(ρε,σ(s)) = −

s
Rdiﬀ(ρε,σ, f ε) + Sdiﬀ(ρε,σ) + Rreact(ρε,σ, jε) + Sreact(ρε,σ) dr.
Hence, it follows the chain rule inequality for the regularized curve that L[s,t](ρε,σ, f ε, jε) ≥0.
3. Step (Limit σ →0 and ε →0):
First, we observe that convergence of the energies is
clear due to the convexity. Hence, it suﬃces to show that

We will treat all four estimates and also the convergences σ →0 and ε →0 separately. In each
term we will consider the limit ε →0 ﬁrst, sending σ →0 afterwards.
3a (Diﬀusive terms):
The rate term Rdiﬀas well as the slope term Sdiﬀare convex function-
als. Hence, the upper limit bound for ε →0 follows by Jensen’s inequality (see e.g. [AGS08,
Lem. 8.1.10]) together with ∇ρε
i ⇀∇ρi, jε
r ⇀jr in L1([0, T]) and ρε
i ⇀ρi. For the limit
σ →0, we simply observe that ρi + σ ≥ρi which implies that
|fi|2
ρi+σ ≤|fi|2
ρi . Moreover, we have
∇√ρi + σ =
√ρi
√ρi+δ∇√ρi ≤∇√ρ. This proves the desired estimate for the diﬀusive terms, both
the slope and the rate term.
3b (Reactive rate term):
The limit ε →0 was shown in Proposition 6.3, where we now
rely on Assumption (4.A2) with p = pcrit. For the limit σ →0, we again use the monotonicity
of the perspective function, to get the pointwise bound in the integrand

3c (Reactive slope term):
We use the general fact that a continuous function Φ : RI →R
satisfying the growth estimate |Φ(u)| ≤C(1+|u|)r deﬁnes via u 7→Φ◦u a (strongly) continuous
Nemitskii operator from Lrq(Ω) into Lq(Ω) for all q ≥1.
