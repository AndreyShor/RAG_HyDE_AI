Parameters (TNPs), which is introduced and described in detail in ref. [40]. Section 6.2 of
that paper discusses the implementation of the TNP approach in the context of a SCET
resummation calculation with beam, soft and hard functions, which is what is needed here.
Our aim here is to make a simple alternative estimate of the resummation uncertainty to
check our existing MaxDev estimate, and not to replace the latter, so we use a simplified
version of the TNP method as outlined in the following sections.
Given that the issues identified earlier in this section are located in the resummation
region, we focus on this region and do not include matching to the FO cross section.
Further, to simplify and speed up the calculations, we will perform them for on-shell Z
boson production and only for the TBj observable; we expect the pattern of results to
essentially be the same for Drell-Yan and for TCj (the main difference will be some overall
normalisation difference of all uncertainty estimates due to the different Born level cross
sections).
4.3.1
Overview of Method
In our resummation formula (and many others), the ingredients are the fixed-order pieces
(H, B, S) and the non-cusp anomalous dimensions γ (plus the cusp anomalous dimension
Γ). In order to increase the precision of the resummation from an NnLL′ to Nn+1LL′ we
need these ingredients to the n + 1-loop order (and the cusp anomalous dimension at n + 2
loops). At a given order, much of the structure of each of the fixed-order pieces can be
predicted from its renormalization group equation (RGE) and quantities already known for
the NnLL′ calculation, such that a full (n+1) loop calculation is only needed to determine
the µ-independent boundary conditions F, and the (n + 1)-loop anomalous dimensions γ.
If we were applying the full TNP method of ref. [40] to our NnLL′ prediction, we
would first augment the calculation by adding all the pieces at the next order that can be
determined from the RGE along with ingredients that were already known in the NnLL′
calculation, shifting the central prediction. We would then include nuisance parameters for
the remaining boundary conditions F and anomalous dimensions γ and Γ, varying these
by an appropriate amount to generate the theoretical uncertainty. In ref. [40], a proposal
was made for an appropriate size of these variations by looking at the size of F, γ and Γ
for various observables. Writing the expansions of F, γ and Γ as:
F (αs) = 1 +
X
n=1
αs
4π
n
Fn,
(4.2)
Γ (αs) =
X
n=0
αs
4π
n+1
Γn,
(4.3)
γ (αs) =
X
n=0
αs
4π
n+1
γn,
(4.4)
then ref. [40] suggests that the nuisance parameter for Fn+1, γn+1 and Γn+1 should be:
Fn+1 (θn+1) =4Cr (4CA)n n! θn+1,
(4.5)
Γn+1 (θn+1) =2Cr (4CA)n+1 θn+1,
(4.6)
γn+1 (θn+1) =4Cr (4CA)n+1 θn+1.
