Figure 3: Distributions of simulated B0
s →ϕe+e−decays, generated uniformly in q2 and the
decay angles, in (top left) q2, (top right) cos θK, (bottom left) cos θe, and (bottom right) Φ.
All selection criteria except the D−
s veto are applied to the simulation. The efficiency model
integrated over the other variables is also shown.
The decay-time-dependent efficiency is well described by the function [41]
ϵ(t) =
a(t −t0)c
1 + a(t −t0)c(1 + bt) .

Using values of t0, a, b and c determined from simulation, the dilution is D = 0.122±0.015.

Mass and angular distributions
The angular observables are determined by performing unbinned maximum-likelihood
fits, simultaneously to the K+K−e+e−mass and angular distributions of the selected
candidates. The inclusion of m(K+K−e+e−) in the fit aids discrimination between signal
and various sources of background. Two separate fits are performed in each q2 bin, one
to the three dimensional distribution of candidates in m(K+K−e+e−), cos θK and cos θe,
and the second to the two dimensional distribution of candidates in m(K+K−e+e−) and
Φ. The description of the m(K+K−e+e−) distribution of each fit component is identical
to that in Ref. [18].
The signal mass distribution is described by a Gaussian function with power-law tails
on the left- and right-hand side of the spectrum. Bremsstrahlung, and the imperfect nature
of the recovery procedure, leads to a tail that is more pronounced on the left-hand side of
the distribution. The tails are further modified by sigmoid activation functions, which
