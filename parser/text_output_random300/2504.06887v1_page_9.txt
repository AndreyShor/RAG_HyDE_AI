2.3.3
Boulware vacuum
The Boulware vacuum corresponds to the vacuum state that replicates the Minkowski vacuum at both past and future
null infinity. In other words, in this scenario, there is neither incoming nor outgoing radiation at infinity. Therefore, one
can describe the vacuum outside compact, spherically symmetric objects like a static neutron star by Boulware vacuum
– given the absence of both past and future event horizons in such objects. It exhibits nonregularity on both past and
future horizons. The modes corresponding to this state are defined to be the positive and negative frequency with respect
to the Schwarzschild timelike Killing field, denoted as ∂t.
One gets the following two-point function by assuming the conformal invariance discussed in subsection 2.3.1:

Relative Entanglement entropy of the massless Dirac field
We briefly review the calculation of the relative entanglement entropy of a massless fermionic field for disjoint intervals
in the Schwarzschild spacetime using the two-point function. We shall see that it yields various interesting properties
and inequalities associated with the mutual information of the field in various states.
The vacuum states defined in the last section are pure. However, if one considers a restriction to a certain region
of spacetime, the reduced state will generally not be pure. The Reeh-Schlieder theorem implies that the reduced state
is highly mixed [63]. From an algebraic point of view, all von Neumann algebras associated with local observables of
well-behaved QFTs are isomorphically related. However, algebras associated with local observables in different regions
of spacetime can be related in a completely different manner for different QFTs. The entanglement is a kind of quantum
correlation between local observables, and it is a property of the algebra of observables. However, observers restricted
to certain regions of spacetime and following some specified trajectories can observe different correlations due to their
different natural choices of Hilbert space decomposition. In the next section, we will discuss entanglement using localized
quantum probes. The entanglement properties studied by the detector depend on several factors, including the choice
of detector model. To understand what the quantum probes observe and to compare it with the existing literature
on entanglement using various conformal field theory methods, in this section, we first study the relative entanglement
entropy — a measure of total correlation — of the field in different states using the resolvent technique [57; 64; 65]. The
von Neumann/ entanglement entropy associated with a region having reduced density matrix ρA = TrB|ψ⟩⟨ψ| – which
is obtained by tracing out degrees of freedom outside that region – is defined by
SA := −Tr(ρA log ρA).
