Proof. We only give a proof for A2(ε, r), since the proof for A+
2 (ε, r) is very similar. Below, we
view A2(ε, r) as an event for LD, i.e., there is at least one outermost cluster of LD whose boundary
intersects both ∂Bε and ∂Br, called crossing cluster below. Let ¯
A2(ε, r) ⊆A2(ε, r) be the event
that there is only one such crossing cluster. By the BK inequality (see e.g. [41] and the references
therein), we have
P( ¯
A2(ε, r)) ≳P(A2(ε, r)).
(3.1)
More concretely, A2(ε, r) \ ¯
A2(ε, r) implies A2(ε, r)□A2(ε, r), the disjoint occurrence of A2(ε, r)
and A2(ε, r). Note that there is some constant c < 1 such that P(A2(ε, r)) ≤c. Hence, by the BK
inequality,
P(A2(ε, r) \ ¯
A2(ε, r)) ≤P(A2(ε, r))2 ≤c P(A2(ε, r)),
which implies (3.1) immediately.
On the event ¯
A2(ε, r), there is only one crossing cluster, denoted by C. Given C, the loops
contained in the complement of the filling of C in D are distributed as a Brownian loop soup in
that remaining domain, conditioned to have no crossing cluster (recall that for a bounded subset
A of C, its filling is defined as the complement of the unique unbounded connected component of
C\ ¯A). Hence, they are stochastically dominated by LD, which does not contain cluster of diameter
greater than r/10 with positive probability. Therefore, we conclude
P( ¯
A2(ε, r)) ≲P( ¯
A2(ε, r) ∩G(ε, r)),
which combined with (3.1) finishes the proof.
Let us first deal with the boundary case. For this purpose, we consider the following Markovian
exploration of Γ+.
Exploration process 1. We explore Γ+ along the arc ℓ(t) := −exp(−it)r, see Figure 3.1. We
trace every loop in Γ+ that ℓencounters in the counterclockwise direction, in the order that ℓ
encounters them. We stop this exploration the first time that we reach Br/2, namely we stop at a
time that we are tracing along a loop γ that intersects Br/2, exactly at the moment that γ reaches
∂Br/2, so that we have discovered a piece bγ of γ. If none of the loops in Γ+ intersect both ∂Br
and ∂Br/2, then we stop this process at the time that we have discovered all the loops in Γ that
intersect ∂Br.
On the event E1 that there exists a loop in Γ+ which intersects both ∂Br and ∂Br/2, we define
γ and bγ just as above. Let t1 be the first time (according to the parametrization of ℓ) that ℓ
intersects γ. Let a := ℓ(t1), which is one endpoint of bγ. Let b be the other endpoint of bγ. Let K(t1)
be the union of ℓ((0, t1)) together with all the loops in Γ+ that ℓ((0, t1)) intersects. Let H be the
connected component containing 0 of H \ K(t1) ∪bγ. Let f be the unique conformal map from H
onto H with f(0) = 0, f′(0) = 1 and f(∞) = ∞.
Let Σ be the σ-algebra generated by E1, bγ and by all the loops in Γ+ that ℓ((0, t1)) intersects.
Note that f and H are measurable w.r.t. Σ. Conditionally on Σ and on E1, the image of γ \ bγ
under f is a chordal SLEκ in D between f(a) and f(b), which we denote by eγ.
Proof of Proposition 3.2, boundary case. We perform Exploration process 1 for Γ+, and use the
notations there. We work on the event E1. By Lemma 2.1, we have
Bε/4 ∩H ⊆f(Bε ∩H) ⊆B4ε ∩H.
