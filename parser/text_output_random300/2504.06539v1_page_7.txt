The first equality follows from the linearity of the trace and the Leibniz rule for the total derivative.
Next, we define

where V = (2π)3δ(3)(0). In the absence of interactions, these reduce to n0 = |νk|2 and λ0 = µkνk,
with the subscript implying the order in the interaction Hamiltonians. Since ϱ includes the effect
of interactions to all orders, so do n and λ. The total time derivatives are given by

Thus, the last two terms in Eq. (3.12) are evaluated non-perturbatively.
In Ref. [30], particle
production from a scalar condensate was considered for HI = ¯ϕ(t)χχ. In that case, the interaction
term was also evaluated non-perturbatively, which differs from the setup here.
In general, a perturbative expansion is needed for the interaction term. The interaction-state
evolution is given by ϱ →Fϱ0F −1 with the initial state ϱ0 and the evolution operator

Then, we obtain

Under the Born-Markov approximation [19], the interaction term simplifies to
