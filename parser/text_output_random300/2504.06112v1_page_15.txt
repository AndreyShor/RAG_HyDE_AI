lattice. Red and orange tiles represent cooperators playing PDG and SDG, respectively,
whereas blue and dark blue tiles represent defectors respectively playing PDG and SDG.
Top row depicts cases of fixed b = 1.10 and σ = 0.2, for (a) µ = 0, (b) µ = 0.2, (c) µ = 0.5,
(d) µ = 0.8, and (e) µ = 1.0. Bottom row represents cases of fixed b = 1.10 and µ = 0.2,

opposite trend, initially increasing and later declining as cooperation stabilizes. This is the
result of a random initial distribution of strategies and agents playing each game. In this
early stage, defectors, whether in PDG or SDG, exploit neighboring cooperators, obtaining
higher payoffs that leads to their strategy being more easily propagated. However, as the
system evolves, cooperators begin to cluster together, forming cooperative domains that
resist the invasion of defectors. These clusters progressively expand, stabilizing cooperation
within the system. Throughout the entire evolutionary process, the fraction of cooperators
remains higher in ΥSDG than in ΥPDG, indicating that cooperation is more sustainable
within the SDG population.
Moreover, as µ increases, the fraction of cooperators steadily grows, while the proportion
of defectors declines. Additionally, the time required for the fraction of cooperators to reach
its minimum and recover to its maximum decreases, suggesting that a higher µ accelerates
the stabilization of cooperation. Furthermore, the gap between the proportion of cooper-
ators in ΥPDG and ΥSDG narrows as µ increases, indicating a convergence in cooperation
levels between the two subpopulations. The equilibrium configuration of cooperators and
