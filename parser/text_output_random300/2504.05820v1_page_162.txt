NNLO polarized PDFs with MHOU
oped in [152, 151, 6], whereby MHOUs are treated through a theory covariance matrix
determined by scale variations.
3. We deploy the machine-learning methodology developed in [109]. All aspects of the
parametrization and optimization (such as the neural network architecture or the choice
of minimization algorithm) are now selected through a hyperparameter optimization
procedure [334], which consists in an automated scan of the space of models.
Outline.
The structure of the chapter is as follows. In Section 5.1 we review the type of
experimental measurements adopted in our fit of polarized PDFs together with the setting used
to compute the corresponding theoretical predictions. We continue in Section 5.2 discussing
the fitting methodology, along with the newer hyperoptimization algorithm adopted to select
the optimal fit setup. In Section 5.3 we conclude highlighting the most relevant feature of our
new PDFs sets.
5.1. Experimental and theoretical input
In this section, we present the experimental and theoretical input entering the NNPDFPOL2.0
determination. We first introduce the dataset, describing the details of each measurement and
the computational tools used to obtain the corresponding theoretical predictions. We then
discuss their perturbative accuracy and specifically the way in which we account for MHOUs.
5.1.1. The NNPDFPOL2.0 dataset
The NNPDFPOL2.0 parton set is based on measurements of three different polarized observables:
the structure function g1 in polarized inclusive lepton-nucleon DIS; the longitudinal single-
spin asymmetry AW ±
L
for W ±-boson production in polarized proton-proton collisions; and the
longitudinal double-spin asymmetry A1−;2−jet
LL
for single-inclusive jet and dijet production in
polarized proton-proton collisions. The definition of these observables can be found, e.g., in
[38, Sec. 3], and in [335, Sec. 6.2.2]. We review the measurements that we include for each of
these observables in turn.
polarized inclusive DIS structure function. We include measurements performed by the EMC [336],
SMC [337, 338], and COMPASS [339, 340] experiments at CERN, by the E142 [341],
E143 [342], E154 [343], and E155 [344] experiments at SLAC, by the HERMES exper-
iment at DESY [345, 346], and by the Hall A [347, 348, 349] and CLAS [350, 351]
experiments at JLab. All of these experiments provide data for the polarized inclusive DIS
structure function g1, reconstructed from the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry (see,
e.g. [38, Sec. 2.1] for details), except SMC low-x, E155, Hall A, and CLAS, which instead
provide data for g1 normalized to the unpolarized inclusive structure function F1. The
details of the measurements, including their kinematic coverage in the proton momentum
fraction x and virtuality Q2, are summarized in Table 5.1.
