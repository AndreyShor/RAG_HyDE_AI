dT
≈0.35 × 104 ΩK−1 at 100 mK. So the change in ∆T
due to continuous cycling of the magnet is ∼160 mK, comparable to the ∆T ≈200 mK
of the sample stage as measured from the Ruthenium oxide in Figure. 4a for dB

Now for T ≥Tc,
dRxx
dT
increases vastly for νop −δ < νop and νop + δ > νop
making the region outside the superconductivity dome sensitive to the ∆T of the sample
stage. This could be why we get finite |∆Rxx| in Figure. 2c for T > 400 mK. An SC phase
is increasingly more sensitive to a perpendicular magnetic field (SI-Fig. 26) with a rapid
change in the magnetoresistance even with a small field overwhelming the effect of change
of sample temperature compared to an applied B||.24,33,34 The effect of local temperature
change and the change in resistance in TBG is much more evident with the in-plane field, as
seen in our experiment. Similarly, the hysteresis observed near zero filling (ν ∼0), with an
opposite sign as shown in Figure. 2a, is attributed to the negative slope of dRxx
dT
around the
Dirac point, which is characteristic of its insulating behavior. In contrast, near full filling
(ν ∼±4) in Figure. 2a, the hysteresis remains unstable due to the high resistance values in
that region.
In summary, we observe a magnetoresistance hysteresis in the near magic-angle TBG
around the SC phase under the application of an in-plane field. The shift in the observed
Rxx with varied ramp-rate and the anomaly between the transient nature of Rxx in TBG
under B|| between two different sweep directions presents more questions than answers about
the nature and origin of BMR in these systems. A close correspondence with the observed
behavior of the measured local temperature of the sample stage under the applied field opens
up a possibility to explore the effect of induced temperature through the application of a
magnetic field, a possible extrinsic reason for observing such hysteresis in these systems,
