scholar Hiroi [10,11]. What these generally have in common are income restrictions 
and progressive taxation for the wealthy, correcting inequality through stock 
redistribution, investing in public goods (commons), and revitalizing local communities. 
Economist Polanyi has identified three modes of economic classification: 
reciprocity, redistribution, and market exchange [12]. Furthermore, philosopher 
Karatani identified four modes of exchange: reciprocity, plunder and redistribution, 
commodity exchange, and the recovery of reciprocity in a higher dimension [13], while 
anthropologist Graeber identified three moral principles: hierarchy, exchange, and 
baseline communism [14]. These can be classified as (i) a gift economy involving 
reciprocity and the obligation to return, (ii) a power economy involving taxation and 
redistribution, (iii) a market economy based on the impersonal exchange of goods and 
money, and (iv) a concession economy that sublimates the gift economy without the 
obligation to return. The term “concession” is used to distinguish it from the reciprocity 
of gifts and is related to the “Hōtoku” philosophy (transfer to descendants, others, and 
society) [15]. The current capitalist economy is a combination of (ii) the power 
economy and (iii) the market economy; Karatani and Graeber advocate transforming it 
into (iv) the concession economy. 
In (iv) a concession economy, recovering reciprocity in a higher dimension 
means suppressing the negative aspects of the obligation to reciprocate gifts and the 
constraints of the community and promoting the positive aspects of individual freedom. 
As philosopher Sarthou-Lajus says, it involves rethinking reciprocation as a debt owed 
not to the immediate recipient but to others and future generations [16]. Baseline
