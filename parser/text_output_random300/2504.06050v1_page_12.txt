Figure 1. Low-loss far-field surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) in suspended SrTiO3 
membranes. a) Schematic of the s-SNOM/SINS measurement of suspended SrTiO3 membrane. 
b) Experimentally extracted optical dielectric function of SrTiO3 with labeled Reststrahlen bands 
(RBs). (c,d) Calculated dispersions (c) and figure of merit Q (d) of SPhPs in suspended SrTiO3 
membranes with different thickness. RB2 and RB3 are marked in pink and green respectively. 
Symmetric and antisymmetric SPhPs are denoted by dashed and solid curves in (c) respectively. 
The green dots in c,d correspond to the two frequencies used for the field distribution simulation 
in (e). e) Simulated electric field distributions of SPhPs at 650 cm-1 (in RB3) and 400 cm-1 (RB2) 
respectively.
