By restricting random walk paths in the definition of Zdiff

to the time interval r0, Nis, we
obtain a sequence of quantities Zdiff
N,i for i “ 1, . . . , M with Zdiff

by a telescopic product, we can write

The choice of the scales Ni is made so that the the ratios in the RHS have approximately
the same variance Op 1
M q (see Theorem 4.5). The fact that these scales are well separated,
see (4.4), ensures that the ratios in the RHS are approximately independent.
Remark 4.3 (Exponential time scales). The choice of the scales (4.5), which leads to
the decomposition (4.7) into approximately independent factors, resembles what is observed
in the sub-critical regime (1.26) in [CSZ17] and in the more recent papers [CC22, CD24].
Denoting by FL :“ σtωpn, zq: n ď L, z P Z2u the σ-algebra generated by disorder
variables up to time L, we introduce the conditional expectation

which turns out to be close to 1 with high probability (see (4.30)). We define ∆N,i as the
normalised and centred version of the ratios in the RHS of (4.7):
