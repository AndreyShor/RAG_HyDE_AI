inducing a natural isomorphism F ≃F ′.
For Z = Zreg, the space (6.5) maps to F ′(Z) via

−→Hom(X[−k,−1] ⊗Y ′ ⊗Y, X[−k,−1]) ⊗Hom(Y ′∗⊗X[0,k], Y ⊗X[0,k]).
The compatibility with left A-module structures follows from the compatibility of isomorphisms
B1 ≃F(Zreg), B1 ≃F ′(Zreg), and F(Zreg) ≃F ′(Zreg) we have so far.
Let us take elements
a ∈Hom(X[−k,−1] ⊗Y ′ ⊗Y, X[−k,−1]),
b ∈Hom(X[0,k], Y ′ ⊗Y ⊗X[0,k]).
Under the maps B1 →F(Zreg) and B1 →F ′(Zreg), they go to
(6.6)
(a ⊗id)(id ⊗¯RY ⊗id)(id ⊗b) ∈Hom(X[−k,k], X[−k,−1] ⊗Y ∗⊗Y ⊗X[0,k]) ⊂F(Zreg)
and
(6.7) (a ⊗id)(id ⊗R∗
Y ′ ⊗id)(id ⊗b) ∈Hom(X[−k,−1] ⊗Y ′ ⊗Y ′∗⊗X[0,k], X[−k,k]) ⊂F ′(Zreg).
Expanding the isomorphism F(Zreg) ≃F ′(Zreg), the element (6.6) goes to the element repre-
sented by Figure 1, where α and β are labels for a choice of mutually orthogonal isometries
M →Y ⊗X[0,k] and Y ′
1 →X[0,k] ⊗M∗, where M runs over the irreducible classes of C0,k+1, and
the superscript ∨represents the transpose with respect to duality.

Then the irreducibility of Y ′ and Y ′
1 forces Y ′
1 = Y ′, and the part involving b, α∗, β represents
the pairing of (α ⊗id)(id ⊗β∨)(RM ⊗id) and b. Then a standard computation shows that the
overall diagram is indeed equal to the element (6.7).

Appendix A. Duality
Let A• be an abstract spin chain. We next want to address the question of dualizability of
DHR bimodules.
Condition A.1. Each DHR bimodule X over A• is dualizable as a correspondence over A.
Recall that an A-A-correspondence X is said to be a bi-Hilbertian A-A C∗-bimodule [KPW04]
if there is a left Hilbert A-module structure on X, and the topologies induced on X by the left
and right A-valued inner products are equivalent.
Proposition A.2. Suppose Condition 2.4. If each DHR bimodule X has a bi-Hilbertian A-A
C∗-bimodule structure, we have Condition A.1.
Proof. Recall the notion of X having a ﬁnite left numerical index [KPW04]: there is some
constant λ > 0 such that
