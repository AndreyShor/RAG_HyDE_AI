The coefficient of the O(ln(N)) term Aq
4, is the quark cusp anomalous dimension [294]. The
constant coefficient Bq is determined by the integral of the non-singlet splitting function,
which was originally computed in Ref. [292] in the large-Nc limit and recently updated to
the full color expansion [295] as a result of computing different N3LO cross-sections in the
soft limit. The coefficients of the terms suppressed by 1/N in the large-N limit, Cq and
Dq, can be obtained directly from lower-order anomalous dimensions by exploiting large-x
resummation techniques [291]. For completeness, the explicit expressions of γ(3)
ns ±, N→∞(N)
and γ(3)
ns ±, N→0(N) are given in Appendix A of [3].
The remainder terms, eγ(3)
ns,±(N), are expanded over the set of eight functions Gns,±
ℓ
(N) listed
in Table 4.1. The coefficients bns,±
ℓ
(defined in Eq. (4.4)) are determined by imposing that the
values of the eight moments given in Ref. [292] be reproduced. The set of functions Gns,±
ℓ
(N)
is chosen to adjust the overall constant (ℓ= 1), model the large-N behavior (2 ≤ℓ≤5)
and model the small-N behavior (ℓ= 6, 7), consistent with the general analytic structure
of fixed order anomalous dimensions. Specifically, the large-N functions are chosen as the
logarithmically enhanced next-to-next-to-leading power terms (lnk(N)/N2, ℓ= 2, 3, 4, 5) and
the small-N functions are chosen as logarithmically enhanced subleading poles (1/(N + 1)k,
