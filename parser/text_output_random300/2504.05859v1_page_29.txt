2. The steady RC spectroscopy 
The output from a halogen lamp was used as the light source for RC measurements, 
which was collected with a single mode fiber, collimated with a 10× objective, and 
focused onto the sample by an objective (50×, NA=0.6). The reflected light was 
collected with the same 50× objective, and analyzed by a spectrometer (Horiba, 
iHR550) coupled with air-cooled charge-coupled-device camera. The RC spectrum was 
obtained by comparing the reflected light spectrum (Rs) of interest with a featureless 
spectrum (Rr) from the sample upon highly doping or the substrate, which was defined 
as RC ≡
Rs−Rr
Rr . The sample was mounted onto a cold finger of a closed-cycle cryostat 
(Cryo Industries of America) with base temperature of 10 K. The top and bottom gate 
voltages are controlled by two sourcemeters (Keithley 2400). 
3. The transient reflectance spectroscopy  
The transient reflectance (TR) spectroscopy was performed in the same reflectance 
geometry used in the steady RC measurements. The pump pulse was from the output 
of an optical parametric amplifier (OPA, Light Conversion, ORPHEUS-HP) driven by 
a 200-KHz ultrafast laser (1047 nm, Spirit 1040-30-HE, Spectra Physics). The probe 
pulse was a supercontinuum produced by focusing the fundamental light from the laser 
to a 3-mm sapphire crystal. The central wavelength of the pump was 710 nm (1.746 
eV), and the pump fluence was adjusted by a polarizer and half-wave plate. The probe 
was filtered to a narrow spectral range of interest (e.g., 2.01 to 2.10 eV for detecting 
resonances of WS2, 1.58 to 1.69 eV for detecting resonances of MoSe2), for minimizing 
the fluence that is kept below 1 μJ/cm2. The pump and probe beam sizes at the sample 
were 5.5 and 1.9 μm, respectively. The pump was chopped at a frequency of 481 Hz. 
The reflected probe was analyzed by a home-built spectrometer (1200 gr/mm grating; 
100 mm focal length) coupled with a fast line scan camera (Hamamatsu C15821-2351). 
The overall temporal resolution is 600 fs. For each delay, the TR spectrum was acquired 
with exposure time of six seconds. The dynamics of the TR signal and extracted 
quantities (e.g., 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 and ∆𝑇𝑇∗) are analyzed by a two-exponential function, 𝐴𝐴∙
𝑒𝑒−𝜏𝜏/𝜏𝜏𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟+ 𝐵𝐵∙𝑒𝑒−𝜏𝜏/𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑+ 𝐶𝐶. A, B, C, 𝜏𝜏𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 and 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 are fitting parameters, the 
last two of which are the rise and decay time constants.

As shown in Figure S3f, 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 in MoSe2 can be obtained by the parallel-plate capacitor

𝑑𝑑0(≈1 nm), and 𝑑𝑑𝑤𝑤(≈0.6 nm) are the thicknesses of top hBN, bottom hBN, inset hBN, 
and monolayer WS2, respectively, determined by either an atomic force 
microscope(AFM) or the contrast analysis of the optical image; 𝜀𝜀(≈3)[2] and 𝜀𝜀𝑤𝑤(≈7)[3] 
are the dielectric constants of hBN and WS2; Δ𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡 and Δ𝑉𝑉𝑏𝑏 are the top and bottom 
gate voltages relative to that of doping onset; 𝜀𝜀0 and e are vacuum permittivity and
