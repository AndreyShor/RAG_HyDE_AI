Figure S5. Determination of the temperature-increase TR profile. (a) The steady RC 
spectra of the AW resonance of WS2 at various temperatures. (b) The contrast between 
the RC spectrum at elevated temperature (RC𝑇𝑇) and that at base temperature (RC𝑇𝑇0 and 
𝑇𝑇0 =10 K), defined as ൫RC𝑇𝑇−RC𝑇𝑇0൯൫RC𝑇𝑇0 + 1൯

, which is equivalent to the 
temperature-increase TR profile. The inset shows the normalized TR profiles. (c) The 
maximums of the temperature-increase TR profiles as a function of temperature 
increment. 
6.3 The screening TR profile 
The mobile photoexcited excitons in MoSe2 will enhance the surrounding screening 
on WS2 and hence modulate the reflectance resonances of WS2. To mimic the 
screening-induced TR profile, we enhanced the surrounding screening on WS2 by 
electron doping MoSe2, and measured steady RC spectra, as shown in Figure S6a. As 
𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 in MoSe2 increases, the AW resonance exhibits a red shift, along with slight 
reduced magnitude, shown in Figure S6b. The TR profile is given by 
൫RC𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒−RC0൯(RC0 + 1)
⁄
, where RC𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 and RC0  are the RC spectra of the AW 
resonance with electron doped and neutral MoSe2, respectively, as shown in Figure S6c. 
The maximum of the TR profile shows a quick saturation behavior as a function of 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 
(Figure S6d). The normalized TR profiles obtained with various 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 have similar 
shapes, except slight red shift for larger 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 (the inset of Figure S6c).
