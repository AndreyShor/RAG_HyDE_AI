case without an electric field (F = 0), and panel (b) includes an in-plane electric field of
F = 0.3 V/nm.
Figure 6: Third-order nonlinear relative refractive index as a function of photon energy for
different polar substrates: h-BN, SiC, SiO2, and HfO2. (a) Without electric field (F = 0);

In the absence of an electric field, the third-order nonlinear relative refractive index
— shown in Figure 6(a) — exhibits a clear dispersive pattern characterized by alternating
positive and negative regions centered around the polaron resonance energy. As the magnetic
field increases from 0.05T, the nonlinear response’s amplitude and spectral width become
more pronounced. This behavior reflects the enhanced formation of magneto-polarons and
their influence on the nonlinear optical susceptibility of the system. Compared to the linear
case (Fig. 5(a)), the resonance features are more sensitive to changes in the magnetic field,
resulting in greater peak shifts across all substrates. Among them, SiO2 and SiC display
the strongest nonlinear dispersive response, which is consistent with their efficient electron-
