does not greatly affect our analysis. However, the resulting
motion does impinge on the size of ionosperic features we
might resolve, and on how we might detect their temporal
behaviour or motion. Notably, since the TEC estimates are
not strictly comparable because they result from different sig-
nal paths, by comparing them we are neither probing solely
temporal properties nor solely spatial properties of any iono-
spheric disturbances, but a combination of both.

dTEC digests
Before creating our digests (histogram summaries) we filter
and rescale the raw dTEC values in a variety of ways.
First, we usually filter the dTEC events so as to avoid
horizon and/or multipath complications due to signal receives
made at low angles. However, rather than use an angle-based
ad hoc rule such as “ignore all receives less than 20 degrees
above the horizontal” we looked at the dTEC values as a func-
tion of angle and made a cut at the point where error rates
(cycle slips, drop outs, etc) rose above about third; but whose
exact value was chosen so the the cut-off conveniently lies at
an intersection cosine with the ionosphere of exactly 0.4. As
it happens, our chosen cutoff is similar to the 20 degree one,
although we had not set that as a criteria.
Second, as discussed in Sec. IV G 1, we corrected the dTEC
values for the geometry of their LOS path through the iono-
sphere according to our data-driven proceedure.
Third, and as discussed in Sec.
IV G 2, we normalised
dTEC values based on band pair, according to the different
properties (widths) seen for their respective dTEC distribu-
tions for our selected quiet days (2022/006 and 007). A full
table of scalings is given in III, comparing the path-angle cor-
rected scalings against those computed without such correc-
tions.
Appendix: B: Distributions and fits
Particularly at low dTEC event counts, the dTEC his-
tograms can show a wide variety of feature, not all of which
are captured by our standard G2E fitting function. However,
as the sample counts increased, the histograms do tend to
match the G3E form ever more closely, although unexpected
features are still possible. Here we show a range of dTEC his-
tograms for increasing event counts achieved by choosing data
slices with increasing data aggregation. These automatically
generated diagnostics, shown here as Figs. 11, 12, 13, are
shown here to indicate the general nature of the distributions
fitted, and not because they contain specific and interesting
results.
In particular, Fig. 11 shows results for slices populated with
only hundreds of dTEC events/values, and these only hint at
the variety of time, space, and band-dependent distributions
that exist within the whole dataset. Note that although they are
indeed noisy and erratically sampled, the distributions never-
theless can have their own distinct characters according to the
contingencies involved in generating the dTEC values that go
into their shape. As we move to higher event counts, as indi-
cated e.g. on Fig. 12, we see the variety averaged out, albeit
still with the G2E fitting model still performing sucessfully
even into the poorly sampled wings of the distributions.

TABLE III. Computed dTEC normalisation scalings for the 30 band-
pairs used to calculate TEC and dTEC values, as based on aggre-
gated data from the KP “quiet” days 006 and 007 of 2022. The
dTEC values for each individual band-pair were scaled (or not) de-
pending on the path-angle correction specified, then combined into a
histogram/distribution the G2E fitting applied, and a G2E weighted
width calculated. This was then taken as a ratio against the weighted
G2E width for all band-pairs.
Further, note that some distributions have a core dominated
by the Gaussian component, but others are instead dominated
by the exponential parts; at low numbers of dTEC events (e.g.
n < 1000) there is considerable variation.
As already described, when the data is not divided finely,
so that slices might e.g. combining all lpair data, or all lonc
data, this means that event counts can easily exceed 10 or 100
thousand, and indeed reach up to approximately 50 million for
a whole day. Consequently the wider tails of the distributions
became significantly sampled, and the discussed power-law
fall-off is revealed, as seen on Fig. 13. However, the G2E
fitting typically remained effective – albeit not perfect – at
matching the dominant core and wings of the dTEC distribu-
tion.
