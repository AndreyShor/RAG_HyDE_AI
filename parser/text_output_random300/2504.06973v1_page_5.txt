Fig. 3: Orbital analysis of HIP 15429. The top panel shows the RV time series, with data points colour-coded by the instrument
used for observation, and RV orbit models computed from posterior samples (blue lines). The lower left and middle panels show
the posterior distributions for the orbital period P, and eccentricity e. The MAP model is indicated by the solid black line. The
phase-folded RVs and residuals from the MAP model are shown in the right-hand panels.

Fig. 4: Disentangled single-star spectra shifted to presumed rest-frame. The disentangled spectrum of the narrow-lined stripped star
(dark blue) and the fast-rotating Be companion star (orange) are shown in selected wavelength ranges. Both component spectra have
been rescaled assuming light ratios of 0.6 and 0.4 for the narrow-lined star and the broad-lined star, respectively (see Sect. 6.1.2).
The rapid rotation of the Be companion is apparent e.g. in the He I line at 4471.5Å (center panel at bottom). The narrow lines in
the spectrum of the Be star, including the one at 4300 Å, are spurious and arise from disentangling artifacts, telluric or interstellar
absorption.
described in González & Levato (2006) and we used the imple-
mentation by T. Shenar (Shenar et al. 2020, 2022), which re-
quires the binary orbital parameters as input.
Using the inferred orbital parameters from Sect. 4, we fixed
the values of orbital angles, barycentric system velocity, and pe-
riod and performed the disentangling for a 2D grid in KB and
the unknown Be star RV semi-amplitude KBe. For KB, we ex-
plored values within ±2σ of the inferred value 74.1 ± 2.2 km s−1
with a step size of ≈0.5 km s−1. For KBe, we initially tested a
coarser grid with semi-amplitudes between 0 and 74 km s−1 in
steps of 2 km s−1. The results indicated values of KBe close to
zero km s−1, motivating a finer grid search. We refined the range
to 0–36 km s−1, with a step size of 0.5 km s−1. The best-fit values
KB, KBe were determined by minimising the combined χ2 across
all epochs. To avoid spurious features, we forced the disentan-
gled spectra to remain below the continuum in regions without
