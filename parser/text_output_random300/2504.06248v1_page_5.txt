next lemma provides the infinitesimal criterion of sym-
metry in terms of commutation of operators [proof in
Sec. IV A].
Lemma (Infinitesimal condition for Lie symmetries).
A connected local group of transformations G acting on
an open subset of R × RN is a symmetry group of the
first-order ODEs in Eq. (7) if and only if
[U, S] −U[ξ(t, y)] U = 0
(8)
for every generator S = ξ(t, y)∂t +PN
j=1 ϕj(t, y)∂j of G.
For symmetry generators where ξ(t, z)
=
0 and
ϕ1, ..., ϕN are time-independent, the infinitesimal crite-
rion (8) takes the more familiar and elegant form
[K, S] = 0 ,
(9)
where, in general, K = PN
j=1 Fj(t, y)∂j. Doing the calcu-
lation using some symmetry generator S leads to partial
differential equations called the determining equations.
Although Eqs. (8-9) enable using commutation relations
to search for symmetries, there is no general procedure
to obtain particular solutions of the determining equa-
tions [72]: this is the art of Lie’s method [60].
For the Kuramoto model, the generator U = ∂t + K
with K in Eq. (2) acts on observables depending on (t, z)
and we want the symmetries to be automorphisms of the
N-torus [Fig. 1 (b)] potentially acting on time.
Using
the criterion (8), it is straightforward to show that the
global dilatation generator i L0 (rotation of all the oscilla-
tors), the Koopman generator K and the trivial generator
f(t) U for some smooth function f are symmetry genera-
tors. Time translation is expressed in terms of the latter
generators such that ∂t = U −K. However, it is easily
verified that these symmetries do not generate new con-
stants of motion from the monomials or the cross-ratios.
At this point, a simple intuition comes in handy :
the symmetries must map periodic solutions to peri-
odic solutions.
This restricts ξ and ϕ1, ..., ϕN in S
to be periodic functions, enabling their expansion in
Fourier series ξ(t, z) = P
p∈ZN εp(t)zp and ϕℓ(t, z) =
P
p∈ZN φℓp(t)zp. Using commutation relations and sim-
plifying leads to general determining equations form-
ing an infinite differential-algebraic system of equations
[Sec IV C]. To narrow our search for symmetries, we limit
p to a finite subset of ZN with fixed total degree PN
j=1 pj
and we set εp(t, z) = 0 along with ∂tφℓp(t, z) = 0 for all
ℓ, p. Under these restrictions, the determining equations
become a finite overdetermined system of linear equa-
tions
D(A) φ = 0 ,
(10)
where φ is a complex vector of the symmetry genera-
tor coefficients and D(A) is a complex rectangular ma-
trix whose elements depend only on the complex inter-
action matrix A. We call D(A) the determining matrix
[Sec IV D].
The problem of finding a symmetry via the general de-
termining equations thus reduces to the more tractable
problem of finding A such that D(A) has a zero singular
value whose right singular vector corresponds to the co-
efficients φ of a symmetry generator. Under this form, it
is clear that the possibility of having Lie symmetries is
strongly tied to the network.
Using Eq. (10) and symbolic calculations in basic ex-
amples [Sec IV E] lead us to infer a family of network
motifs admitting Lie symmetries in the Kuramoto model.
As soon as there is a source oscillator with natural fre-
quency ωs connecting disjoint subgraphs with vertex sets
W1, ..., Wr in the network, the Koopman generators of
the subgraphs in the rotating frame of the source
Sη = Kη −iωsLη
0 ,
η ∈{1, ..., r} , r > 1
(11)
are
Lie
symmetry
generators,
where
Kη
=
P
j∈Wη
P
k∈V(Ajkzk−¯Ajk¯zkz2
j )∂j and Lη
0 = P
j∈Wη zj∂j
[Lem. S10]. Concretely, for a given solution (zj(t))j∈V,
such symmetries make the oscillators in the subgraphs
evolve in time in the frame of the source while leaving
the trajectories of the other oscillators unchanged, which
gives a new solution (˜zj(t))j∈V.
The symmetry generators in Eq. (11) enable us to un-
cover new forms of constants of motion for the Kuramoto
model [Fig. 2 (c) and proof in Sec. IV E].
Theorem 3 (Symmetry-generated constants of motion).
Consider that the Kuramoto model in Eq. (1) has a sym-
metry generator Sη as defined in Eq. (11) related to the
subgraph induced by Wη and the source oscillator s.
3A. If four vertices a, b, c, d ∈V \ {s} have
3.1A. a unique incoming edge with weight As from s;
3.2A. identical natural frequencies ω;
3.3A. and one, two or three of them belong to Wη,
then the cross-ratio cabcd and Sη[cabcd] are functionally
independent constants of motion.
3B. If three vertices u, v, w ∈V \ {s} have
3.1B. a unique incoming edge with weight As from s;
3.2B. identical natural frequencies ω = ωs−2 Im(As);
3.3B. and one or two of them belong to Wη,
then the cross-ratio csuvw and Sη[csuvw] are functionally
independent constants of motion.
As a consequence, if there is a source star with n ≥4
leaves having identical frequencies ω (to satisfy 3.1A),
where all edges from the source s to the leaves have iden-
tical complex weight As (to satisfy 3.2A), Thm. 2 (and
Lem. S6) implies that there are n −3 conserved cross-
ratios (cρ)ρ∈{1,...,n−3} associated with the leaves. There
is also one more conserved and functionally independent
cross-ratio cs depending on the core if ω = ωs −2 Im(As)
(condition 3.2B). Now, recall that there are no restric-
tions on the outgoing edges from the n leaves to conserve
the related cross-ratios and that Bn is the Bell number.
