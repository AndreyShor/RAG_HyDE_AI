bilinear combinations of decay amplitudes. Due to the limited size of the available dataset,
the measurement is performed integrated in decay time. Neglecting for now decay-time
acceptance effects, the term involving hi is diluted relative to that involving Ji + ˜Ji by a

Reduced distributions are obtained integrating either over Φ or over both cos θK
and cos θe, with the result that many of the terms in the sum of Eq. (1) vanish. The
reduced distribution after integration over Φ and decay time contains only terms with
i ∈[1c, 1s, 2c, 2s, 6s], in the notation of Ref. [21], and can be written as

The last term can also be expressed in terms of ⟨A′
6⟩= ⟨A6⟩/(1 −⟨FL⟩). The reduced
distribution after integration over cos θK, cos θe and decay time contains only terms with
i ∈[3, 9], and can be expressed as

Here, the triangular braces indicate that the observables include contributions from the
hi terms and are different from the observables at t = 0, which will be referred to without
the braces. These reduced distributions neglect contributions that are suppressed by the
small size of the electron mass squared compared to q2.
The analysis is performed in bins of reconstructed q2 and the measurements correspond
to rate-averages of the observables over the q2 bin.
The reconstructed values of q2
differ from the true values due to experimental resolution and radiative losses from the
electrons that are not recovered in the event reconstruction. The correlation between the
reconstructed q2 value and the true value in simulation is illustrated in Fig. 2.
