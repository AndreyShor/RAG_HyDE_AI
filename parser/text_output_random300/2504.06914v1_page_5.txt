tion, we extend our analysis to include elastic and struc-
tural indicators, such as the shear modulus, solid order,
and hexatic order, to further explore the active softening
of solid. We perform this analysis using ρσ2 = 1.1 and
˜Dt = 1.0.
A.
Shear modulus
Within linear response, the shear modulus is given by
G = σtot
xy /Exy.
We compute this from numerical sim-
ulations by applying a shear strain Exy and measuring
the change in total shear stress σtot
xy accounting for tra-
jectories displaying linear response; see Appendix-C. The
stress tensor has contribution from interaction calculated
using the usual virial term and swim stress due to activ-
ity.
The standard virial expression due to interaction
gives,

where, V denotes the system volume in d = 2 dimensions,
fij is the interaction force between particles i and j with
separation rij, and α, β denote the cartesian components
of the vectors. On the other hand, the summation index
j runs over all interacting neighbors of the ith particle.
The active swim stress can be expressed as [80],

calculation.
Figure 3(a) shows the change in mean shear modu-
lus, G, with standard errors, as a function of activity Λ.
We observe a steady decrease in it from the equilibrium
value indicating softening of the solid with activity. As
activity increases, fraction of trajectories following linear
response decreases to vanish near Λ = 10; see Appendix-
C. The decrease in G with activity can be described by
G = G0 −G1Λ2 with G0 = 109.84 and G1 = 0.094. To
further explore this softening and the fluidization tran-
sition, we compute structural indicators, including solid
order ψG, hexatic order ψ6, and defect fraction δd.

Solid order
The structure factor of the system is given by
S(q) = ⟨ρqρ−q⟩

resentative Λ values are shown in Fig.5.

triangular lattice, quasi-Bragg peaks emerge at qp =

(0, ±2π/ay), (±2π/a, ±π/ay), as shown in Fig. 5(a),(b).
The solid order parameter ⟨ψG⟩averages S(q) over the
six quasi-Bragg peaks at G := {qp}. Fig. 5(b) shows the
variation of ⟨ψG⟩with Λ. The order parameter ⟨ψG⟩van-
ishes as the solid melts. At the melting point Λ = 10.0
the variance of the order parameter ⟨(∆ψG)2⟩peaks (in-
set, Fig. 3(b) ). This analysis shows that the quadratic
scaling of non-affinity with activity is observed across the
entire activity range before solid melting.
As the active solid softens and melts with increasing
Λ, the quasi-Bragg peaks flatten and merge (Fig. 5(c)-
(f) ), similar to equilibrium 2D melting [76]. The S(q)
in Fig. 5(c),(d) are characteristic of a hexatic. The six
fold symmetry softens and starts to merge in Fig. 3(e)
as the hexatic melts. Finally, at Λ = 20, S(q) gets the
uniform ring reflecting isotropy of the fluid; see Fig. 5(f).
Therefore, S(q) suggests a two-stage melting from solid
to hexatic to fluid.
