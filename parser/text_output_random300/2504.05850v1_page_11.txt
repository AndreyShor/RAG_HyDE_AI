together with the transformation z 7→1/z in the arguments.
Transformations of labels 0 ↔1 and 1 ↔z generate the transformation group S3 of the three external
vertices 0, 1, and z. So, every transformation of external vertices can be expressed as a sequence of the
transformations 0 ↔1 and 1 ↔z.
7.3. Product factorization. If the graph G of a three-point function or a graphical function disconnects
upon removal of the three external vertices, G = G1 ∪G2 with G1 ∩G2 ⊆{0, 1, z}, then the Feynman
integral trivially factorizes into Feynman integrals over the internal vertices of G1 and G2. This implies

where, after the elimination of contractions, α = (β1 ∪β2) \ (β1 ∩β2).
8. Appending an edge
In this section, we present the main calculation technique for graphical functions: appending an edge
to a graph G at the external vertex z, thus creating a graph G1 with a new vertex z, see Figure 1. The
appended edge is scalar with weight 1. Appending a sequence of edges and external differentiation at
z = z2 allows one also to append edges with non-zero spin and weights ̸= 1, see Section 8.4.
Because the appended edge has spin 0, weight 1, we obtain from (10) for k = 1,

We use the symbol □for differential operators that act on the variable z ∈C. The subscript λ refers
to the dimension D while the superscript α carries the spin structure.
We will then show how to construct the unique solution of the effective Laplace equation in the space
of graphical functions.

G(z). We consider f α
G(z) as a function of the invariants zz and (z −1)(z −1),
see (44). Let ∂s be the differential with respect to the invariant (z −s)(z −s) for s = 0, 1.
We define the differential operators

δ2 = −zzδ0 + (z + z)δ1.
Moreover, δ0, δ1, δ2 span a solvable three-dimensional Lie-Algebra, [δ0, δ1] = 0, [δ0, δ2] = δ0, [δ1, δ2] = δ1.
