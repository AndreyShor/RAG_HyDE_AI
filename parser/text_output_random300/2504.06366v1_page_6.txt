that the ocean has just passed its most efficient period for absorbing heat from the atmosphere per 
unit of global surface temperature increase. The ensemble mean results from the models can 
capture this temporal feature. We also conducted a sensitivity test regarding the window length 
used to calculate OHUE (see Figure S1 in Supporting Information). The results from 15-year and 
25-year windows are consistent with those shown in Figure 1, and longer windows naturally yield 
smoother results. 
We show the two results centered at the years 1988 and 2000 to evaluate whether the changes 
in OHUE are statistically significant between these periods. We found that 6 out of 7 models show 
a significant increase, with p-values less than 0.01, except for model CNRM-CM6-1 (Figure 1b). 
Similarly, the observed OHUE change between the 1988 and 2000 periods based on GF is also 
significant. The increase in OHUE is 0.29 ± 0.10 Wm⁻² K⁻¹, based on the multi-model mean of six 
models and their standard deviation. Moreover, the relative change and the corresponding cross-
model uncertainty is +67% ± 35%. These results from the multi-model ensemble mean illustrate 
that the temporal feature reflects a forced response. The observed OHUE increase is 0.13 (+25%), 
0.11 (+20%), and 0.23 (+41%) Wm⁻² K⁻¹ from the IAP dataset, Ishii dataset, and GF, respectively. 
In addition, the decrease between 2010 and 2000 based on GF is also significant (not shown).
