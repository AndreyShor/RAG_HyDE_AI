Note that our definition of ρχ includes no analogue of the term −γ−1 log θ appearing in [MRV16,
Equation 3.11]. This is because this term can simply be absorbed into the error term by making s
sufficiently large.

Convergence of the small scales
We are now ready to state and the prove the following result in which, roughly speaking, we compute
the Laplace functional of the measure µγ,s,t defined in (6.4). Before proceeding, we introduce the
following definition.
Definition 6.2. We say that a function χ : [0, 1]d →R is scaled-admissible if for all ε > 0, there
exists R0 ≥1 such that edsρχ(BR,s) ≤ε for all s ≥0 sufficiently large and for all R ≥R0 such that
(es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N.
We have the following key result.
Lemma 6.3. Let ε > 0. Then, for s ≥0 sufficiently large, for t > s sufficiently large, and for any
scaled-admissible function χ : [0, 1]d →R in the sense of Definition 6.2, such that

Proof. For R ≥1, s ≥0 such that (es +1)(R+1)−1 ∈N, we consider the decomposition of the cube
[0, 1]d given in (6.3). We also consider t > s and a function χ : [0, 1] →Rd satisfying conditions
(6.6). In order to lighten the notation, we define
