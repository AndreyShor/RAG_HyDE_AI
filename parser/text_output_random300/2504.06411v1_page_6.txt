0→t v denote the parallel transport of a vector v ∈TaM along Γ. Let v(t) be a deterministic
curve in TaM such that v(0) = v(T) = 0. Then Yt :=

0→t v(t) is the TM-valued semimartingale over Γ such
that Y0 = YT = 0. The admissibility hypothesis ensures that there exists a deformation ϵ 7→Γϵ of Γ with δΓ = Y .
Next, given a closed subset K ⊆M we describe how to construct variations of the portion of Γ contained in
K. Recall that τ h
K is the hitting time for K and if τ (h,e)

Γ that lies in K. Let f ∈C∞(M) be supported on the interior int K of K and X ∈X (M). Then f · X vanishes

A Stochastic Analogue of the Fundamental Lemma of the Calculus of Variations
We will formulate a stochastic analogue of the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations in coordinate
charts. Let ⟨·, ·⟩denote the standard Euclidean inner product and (e0, · · · , en) denote the standard basis of Rn.
Lemma 3.3. Let M be a smooth n-manifold and U ⊆M be a coordinate chart. We identify U with an open
subset of Rn, also denoted by U. Let Γ ∈S (M) be admissible and Ξ : S (M) →S (Rn) satisfy Ξ(Γ)At = Ξ(ΓAt)
for any continuous change of time t 7→At. If for every ( ¯U, T)-deformation ϵ 7→Γϵ we have
