Definition II.22 (Expectation). Given a univariate random variable X, its expectation E [X] is defined as E [X] =
P
k∈ΩpkXi.
For a multivariate random variable with dimension d ⃗X, its expectation E[ ⃗X] is a vector with E

iα
= E [X α] for
α ∈[d].
Remark II.23. For univariate random variables X, Y, ⟨X|Y⟩= E [X ∗Y].
Definition II.24 (Variance). For a univariate random variable X, its variance is σ2 = E
h
(X −E [X])2i
. The
variance can also be denoted Var X.
For a multivariate random variable ⃗Y, its covariance matrix Σ satisfies Σαβ = E

There are also some basic concepts from quantum information that needs to be addressed and assigned with
notations for convenience.
Definition II.25 (Measurement). As in quantum mechanics, in some Hilbert space H, given an observable (Hermitian
operator) A and a normalized state |ψ⟩, measuring the observable on the state |ψ⟩generates a probability space and
a random variable (as the resulting eigenvalues). Let the random variable be λ, we denote this as λ ∼(A, |ψ⟩), and
the probability of some event E depending on λ being Pλ∼(A,|ψ⟩)[E(λ)].
Remark II.26. When we are describing probabilities resulting from some algorithm, the labels for the Hilbert space,
the subscript after P can be dropped.
Definition II.27 (Phases of Unitary). Given some unitary U, let arg(U) be a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues
in (−π, π] such that U = exp{i arg(U)}. In other words, arg(U) will denote the operator corresponding to the phases
of U.
Remark II.28 (Phase Estimation). Given a unitary operator U and input state |ψ⟩, as an example, phase estimation
aims to produce a random variable θ ∼(arg(U), |ψ⟩).
Definition II.29 (absolute value mod 2π). Given a real number (in practice, a phase) φ, we define |φ|2π as
minn∈Z |φ −2πn|.

Primitives
In this section, we set up the problem of mean value estimation and provide useful algorithmic tools. First, we
introduce the notion of a quantum experiment.
Definition II.30 (Quantum Experiment). Given a multivariate random variable ⃗X of dimension d, a quantum
experiment is a unitary U such that for all k ∈Ω
U |k⟩|0⟩= |k⟩

The unitary acts on HΩ⊗Hvec, where Hvec is the Hilbert space with basis representing quantum states corresponding
to vectors in Rd.
Remark II.31 (Incorporating Ancilla). The experiment can be redefined to incorporate extra changes in other ancillas
as
U |k⟩|0⟩|0⟩= |k⟩

Just as in Remark II.5 we drop it for simplicity.
In practice, we might not have access to either the synthesizer or the quantum experiment, but presented with
access to a complete quantum experiment in the form of the following
Definition II.32 (Complete Quantum Experiment). Given a multivariate random variable ⃗X, a complete quantum
experiment is a unitary V with
V |0⟩|0⟩=
