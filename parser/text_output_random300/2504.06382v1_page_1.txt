Abstract: Conformal Gravity (CG) is a Weyl–invariant metric theory free of divergences
that with generalized Newman boundary conditions, reduces to renormalized Einstein–
AdS gravity. By evaluating CG’s action on a replica orbifold, one obtains a codimension-2
local conformal invariant functional, LΣ, which recovers known results as the renormalized
area, the reduced Hawking mass and the Willmore Energy. Although it was anticipated
that LΣ would be finite, a general analysis of its asymptotic behavior near the conformal
boundary remains unexplored. In this work, we show that LΣ is finite for a boundary–
anchored surface Σ embedded in an arbitrary ambient spacetime, including surfaces that
are non–minimal and are anchored at arbitrary angles. This result extends the conformal
renormalization prescription to codimension–2 functionals.
