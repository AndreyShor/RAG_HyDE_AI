SHiP experiment at the SPS Beam Dump Facility
1SHiP Collaboration & HI-ECN3 Project Team
Abstract
In 2024, the SHiP experiment, together with the associated Beam Dump Facility (BDF) un-
der the auspices of the High Intensity ECN3 (HI-ECN3) project, was selected for the future
physics exploitation of the ECN3 experimental facility at the SPS. The SHiP experiment is a
general-purpose intensity-frontier setup designed to search for physics beyond the Standard
Model in the domain of Feebly Interacting Particles at the GeV-scale. It comprises a multi-
system apparatus that provides discovery sensitivity to both decay and scattering signatures
of models with feebly interacting particles, such as dark-sector mediators, both elastic and
inelastic light dark matter, as well as millicharged particles. The experiment will also be
able to perform both Standard Model measurements and Beyond Standard Model searches
with neutrino interactions. In particular, it will have access to unprecedented statistics of
tau and anti-tau neutrinos. The construction plan foresees commissioning of the facility
and detector, and start of operation in advance of Long Shutdown 4, with a programme of
exploration for 15 years of data taking. By exploring unique regions of parameter space for
feebly interacting particles in the GeV/c2 mass range, the SHiP experiment will complement
ongoing searches at the LHC and searches at future colliders.
