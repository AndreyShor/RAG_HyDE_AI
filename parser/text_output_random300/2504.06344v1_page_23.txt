however, we now note that we have to use W2,4 Câ€²C from (4.1).
To boot, the analysis is
more complicated than the one for k = r from section 3.1, for the same reason mentioned in
footnote 17.
Thus, to continue, we now borrow the results from Section 5 of [1]. What is done there
is easy to describe (but the details are a bit messy): one plugs the solutions (4.1) into the
r.h.s. of eqn. (4.2) and demands that it be orthogonal to the zero modes of the adjoint of the
Â¯âˆ‚operator appearing on the l.h.s. of (4.2).21 One thus finds that the consistency conditions
imposed by (4.2) on the 2r complex coefficients C[Câ€²+pk]r

and repeated entries in Sj are identified so that each set has
r
gcd(k,r) elements. The union of
all sets Sj is the set {0, ..., r âˆ’1}.
The first point to make is that there are extra moduli appearing at this level of the
expansion, due to the fact that the equations (4.3) do not fix all moduli. To see this, let
us count the number of moduli for general k and r > 1, taking into account the constraints
(4.3), modding by the constant gauge transforms leaving the boundary conditions and gauge
condition invariant. First, there are 4gcd(k, r) constant holonomies Ï•Câ€²
Âµ , as per (2.10). Then,
there are 2r real components of CA
2 and 2r real components of CA
4 . Thus the total number of
real moduli is 4r +4gcd(k, r). These are subject to the constraints of eqn. (4.3): the gcd(k, r)
real constraints on the first line and 2gcd(k, r) real constraints on the second line. Thus, it
would appear that the number of moduli minus the number of constraints is 4r + gcd(k, r).
We notice, however, that the gauge conditions (2.16) are invariant under constant gauge
transformations in the gcd(k, r) Cartan directions, the ones along the directions of the allowed
21Consider the equation Â¯âˆ‚X = F. Take the inner product of both sides with Î¶, a zero mode of the adjoint
of Â¯âˆ‚, and, integrating by parts on the l.h.s., find that the inner product (Î¶, F) = 0.
22Eqn. (4.3) is eqn. (5.3) in [1] with the r.h.s. set to zero to account for the fact that âˆ†= 0.
