 reflects the quantum coupling that modulates the fermion’s 
velocity influenced by quantum corrections like Fermi pressure, Bohm potential and spin 
polarization.
 
2.1.2. Ion dynamics 
In the case of ions, due to their large mass as compared to the electrons and positrons, 
i.e., 
,e p

m
m ≪ 1, the quantum effects are insignificant and so they can be considered classical 
[35]. The governing equations for ions in the rotating frame of reference are,
