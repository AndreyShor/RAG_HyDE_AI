where the first term 2 ζ(5) can be ignored, since it does not survive the su-
pertrace, and the dots stand for terms of order s6
I and higher. In the reduced
theory, Str M2
0 = Str s2
I/R2. Therefore, if Str s2
I ̸= 0, the leading contribu-
tions to the quadratically divergent V1,red and to the finite V1 are those of
order s2
I. Equating the two, the effective cutoff for the reduced theory is
Λ =
p
3 ζ(3)/(π R) ≃0.6/R, in agreement with the expectations. Suppose
now that Str M2
0 = Str s2
I/R2 = 0 but Str M4
0 = Str s4
I/R4 ̸= 0. Then the
leading contributions to the logarithmically divergent V1,red and to the finite
V1 are those of order s4
I. Equating the two, the effective cutoff for the reduced
theory is Λ = e25/3/(16 π4 R) ≃2.7/R, in agreement with the expectations.
Finally, we can consider the case in which both Str M2
0 = Str s2
I/R2 = 0 and
Str M4
0 = Str s4
I/R4 = 0. In such a case, V1,red and V1 are both finite, with
V1,red = Str(M4
0 log M2
0)/(64 π2) = Str(s4
I log s2
I)/(64 π2 R4) and V1 receiv-
ing contributions only from the last line of Eq. (1.38), therefore coinciding
with V1,red up to corrections of order s6
I or higher.
In the N = 2, 4, 8 cases, V1 in (1.36) is always negative semidefinite, van-
ishes only for unbroken supersymmetry and for fixed R is minimised by half-
integer twists. At any individual KK level n ̸= 0, the supertraces are identical
to those in the reduced theory (n = 0). In N = 2, where there is only a single
twist a, Str M2
0 = Str M2
n = Str s2
I/R2 = −8a2/R2 < 0. In N = 4, where
there are two independent twists ai (i = 1, 2), Str M2
0 = Str M2
n = 0, as
expected, and Str M4
0 = Str M4
n = Str s4
I/R4 = 72 a2
1 a2
2/R4 > 0. In N = 8,
as originally described in [33], there are four independent twists ai (i =
1, 2, 3, 4). In the reduced theory, it is known that Str M2k
0 = 0 (k = 1, 2, 3)
and Str M8
0 = Str s8
I/R8 = 40320 a2
1 a2
2 a2

4/R8. We find that the same
result holds true at any fixed KK level n ̸= 0 in the compactified theory:
Str M2k
n = 0 (k = 1, 2, 3) and Str M8
n = Str s8
I/R8 = 40320 a2
1 a2
2 a2
3 a2
4/R8. In
the limit |ai| ≪1 (for all i = 1, 2, 3, 4), the contributions of the KK modes be-
come negligible and V1 ≃V1,red, up to corrections of order s8
I and higher. For
half-integer twists, V1 ≃−0.0125/R4, not too far from V1,red ≃−0.0184/R4.
In the case of a single extra dimension compactified on a circle, considered
in the above example, the Scherk–Schwarz twist leading to supersymme-
try breaking corresponds to a global continuous R-symmetry of the higher-
dimensional action. We can smoothly take the limit of small twist parame-
