Figure 4.29: Same as Fig. 4.25 for Higgs production in association with W + and Z gauge bosons: from
top to bottom, Zh, W +h, and W −h.
• For the gluon PDF a more significant shift is observed between NNLO and N3LO, thus
making the inclusion of N3LO important for precision phenomenology.
• The inclusion of MHOUs improves perturbative convergence, mostly by shifting central
values at each order towards the higher-order result, by an amount that decreases with
increasing perturbative order.
• Upon inclusion of MHOUs the fit quality becomes all but independent of perturbative order,
and PDF uncertainties generally decrease (or remain unchanged) due to the improved
data compatibility.
