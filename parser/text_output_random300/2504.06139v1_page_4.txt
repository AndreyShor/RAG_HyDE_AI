It is signalling if it is not non-signalling.
Non-signalling correlations can be of many types. Of the boxes with this
property, we ﬁnd ones that can be implemented with classical theory, quan-
tum theory or even super-quantum theory. Since the class of non-signalling
correlations include quantum and classical ones, we may deﬁne a box as be-
ing non-local in the same way some quantum correlations are non-local. A
box is said local if the output on one side depends only on the input on the
same side. Local correlations can be simulated with only shared randomness
by non-communicating participants.
Deﬁnition 3. A box P is local if it can be written as
P(a, b|x, y) =
X
i
λiP A
i (a|x)P B
i (b|y)
where λi ≥0 and P
i λi = 1. A box is non-local if it is not local.
In essence, deﬁnition 3 says that any local box is a convex combination
of local boxes.
This is in accordance with the fact that the set of local
correlations form a polytope[1] with the vertices being deterministic boxes
(i.e. boxes with output uniquely determined).
Now that we have deﬁned what is non-locality, it would be useful to be
able to quantify it. The value deﬁned next is taken from the Clauser-Horne-
Shimony-Holt inequality (or CHSH inequality)[9] which give an upper bound
on local correlations. This inequality was designed as an application of Bell’s
famous theorem[3], but became a measure of non-locality. It was originally
stated with expectation values of measurements of quantum system. We give
a more information theoretical description from [14].
Deﬁnition 4. Let Xxy(P) = P(00|xy) + P(11|xy) −P(01|xy) −P(10|xy).
The CHSH value of box P is
CHSH(P) = max
xy |Xxy(P) + Xx¯y(P) + X¯xy(P) −X¯x¯y(P)|
