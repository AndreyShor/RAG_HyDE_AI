E[dW j

t ] = δj,kdt, and the multiplicative noise is understood in the Itˆo convention. Here, we denote the ensemble
average over the Wiener process by E. Using the properties of the Wiener process, one can verify that the time
evolution of E[∣ψt⟩⟨ψt∣] obeys GKSL equation, Eq. (1) in the main text.
Since the generator of the time evolution for the unraveled state is quadratic, and the initial condition is pure
gaussian state ∣DW⟩, one can apply the Wick’s theorem [112] for each unraveled state. In particular, we have the
determinant representation of χ(λ,t) [10],
χ(λ,t) = log E[det[δj,k + (eλ −1)⟨ψt∣a†
jak∣ψt⟩]L
j,k=1].
(S-108)
Thus, we only need to calculate ⟨ψt∣a†
jak∣ψt⟩. To compute ⟨ψt∣a†
jak∣ψt⟩numerically, we employ the following numerical
scheme [59, 87, 88]. Due to the quadratic nature of the time evolution, the unraveled state can be always written as
∣ψt⟩=

with the normalization condition U †U = 1. Then one has ⟨ψt∣a†
jak∣ψt⟩= (UU †)∗
j,k. Furthermore, from Eq. (S-107), we
have U(t + dt) = e−i√4γdWte−ihdtU(t) with hj,k ∶= −δj+1,k(1 −δk,−L+1) −δj−1,k(1 −δk,L) and (dWt)j,k ∶= δj,kdW j
t . This
provides the update rule for U(t) in our numerical simulations.
