2.2. The Navascu´es-Pironio-Acin hierarchy
The Navascu´es-Pironio-Ac´ın (NPA) hierarchy is a systematic approach to check if p = p(ab|xy) =
Tr(ρMa|xNb|y) ∈Q \ L [127, 128]. It provides a sequence of increasingly tighter outer approximations to
the set of quantum correlations Q1 ⊇· · · Qk ⊇· · · ⊇Q, where each k–th level in the hierarchy defines
the following semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation:
maximize{φ| Tr ΓkJi = 0, Tr ΓkΦi = pi, Γk −φ1 ≥0, Γ ⪰0}
(14)
where Ji and Φi are linked to the moment matrix Γk, which encodes the constraints derived from quantum
mechanics: (i) Definition of the moment matrix Γk – for a given level k in the hierarchy,
Γk
i,j = Tr ρ(τ k
i )†τ k
j ,
τ 1 = {1, Ma|x, Nb|y}abxy,
τ k+1 = {τ k, τ k
i τ 1
j }ij
where τ k = {τ k
i } is the set of monomials of measurement operators up to degree k, e.g., consisting of
products like Ma|xNb|y or Ma′|xMa|x. The size of Γ grows with k, encompassing higher-order correlations
between measurement operators.
(ii) Constraints – The condition Tr ΓkJi = 0 and Tr ΓkΦi = pi with opportune J and Φ suitably rewrite
the constraints that p ∈Qk only if ∃Γ ⪰0 with p = {pi}i and (similarly for Nb|y)
Ma|xMa′|x = δa,a′1,
X
a
Ma|x = 1,
[Ma|x, Nb|y] = 0.
These constraints are incorporated into the structure of Γ, imposing relations between the matrix elements
and reducing the affine subspace of the possible correlations.
(iii) Feasibility – If a feasible Γ that solve the SPD problem exists at level k, then p ∈Qk is “k-
quantum”, meaning it can be approximated by a quantum behaviour up to k–th hierarchy level.
If
p ∈Qk+1 =⇒p ∈Qk since Γk is a sub-matrix of Γk+1. In the limit limk→∞Qk = Q, therefore if
p /∈Q =⇒∃k s.t. the problem is unfeasible.
In practice, the NPA hierarchy offers a tractable approximation of the quantum set via a sequence of
SDPs, each solvable by efficient algorithms, though the computational cost increases with the level k. For
many applications, low levels (e.g., k = 2 or 3) already yield tight enough bounds. Intermediate levels,
such as τ 1+AB = τ 1∪{M x
a N y
b }abxy, are also commonly used. Replacing the objective function φ with any
linear function of the elements in τ k, the NPA hierarchy becomes a powerful computational tool—e.g.,
for estimating min-entropy in security proofs (see Sec. 4). Additional methods for DI applications are
discussed in [129–131] and in the SDP review [132].
2.3. Self-testing
In particular cases, DI–protocols not only identify p ∈Q \ L, but from the behaviours p can also infer
the input state and measurements realization R = (| ˜ψ⟩AB , ˜
MA|X, ˜NB|Y ) adopted in the experiment up
to some local invariance Φ (Fig. 2a). When this is possible, we say that the behaviours self-test the
realization, p

Φ(R) [133, 49].
