Here the functions Fn resum all perturbative orders in the ’t Hooft coupling x ≡αNfTR
with TR = 1/2 for the fundamental representation. For our purposes it is sufficient to
consider the latter case.
The leading order function F1 displays a negative pole at x = 3 implying that the
β-function restricted to this order ( β| 1
Nf ), exhibits a UV FP [17–19] as shown in black
in the bottom-left panel of Fig.8. We use as benchmark the SU(10) gauge theory with
Nf = 20 Dirac fermions. Beyond the 1/Nf limit it is not clear whether the fixed point
survives. Nevertheless, preliminary negative lattice results exist for the SU(2) case with
24 and 48 Dirac fermions [20].

To gain some understanding on this issue we will consider the impact on the four
dimensional β-function by solving the SCR with ω(1) as an input. This is interesting,
as noticed in [14, 21], because a fixed-order truncation in the critical exponent is not
equivalent to the same-order truncation in the β-function. In fact, ω(1) feeds partially to
all the higher order functions Fn as it is illustrated from the relations below, first for F1
