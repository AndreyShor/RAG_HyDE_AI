for a + b = m −1. Replacing ΩX by (−1)m−1ΩX doesn’t change the pairing ⟨−, −⟩CY. Combined with
Theorem 3.1, the result follows.

By deﬁnition of LG and CY Frobenius algebra structures on Hm−1
pr
(X), Theorem 1.1 immediately
follows.
Remark 3.4. During the preparation of this paper, we were informed that [8, Theorem 3.5, Theorem
3.6] presents a similar result to Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.3, speciﬁcally in the case where P = Pr−1
is the projective space and Xf is a smooth hypersurface in P. However, the assumption of smoothness
for Xf ⊂Pr−1 implies that f has an isolated singularity at the origin, making it essential to consider
non-projective cases of P in order to discuss non-isolated singularities.
Furthermore, our map Φ in
Theorem 3.1 is a ring isomorphism, resolving a sign ambiguity in the map r′ in [8, Theorem 3.5] even in
the case of Pr−1.
3.2. Proofs of main results. Here we prove Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 2.8 by expanding upon the
toric Carlson–Griﬃths theorem due to Villaﬂor Loyola [12].
Since Xf is a quasi-smooth hypersurface in PΣ, the collection U = {Ui : i = 0, · · · , r} of open sets,
where Ui = {a ∈Xf | fi(a) ̸= 0}, is a contractible open covering of Xf, called the Jacobian covering of
Xf. If J = (j0, j1, · · · , jp) is an index set with size |J| = p + 1, then we set
UJ = Uj0 ∩· · · ∩Ujp.
Given a vector ﬁeld Z on Cr, let ι(Z) denote the operation of contraction with Z. Given a multi-index
J = (j0, j1, · · · , jp), let

and

Villaﬂor Loyola described the residue map in terms of ˇCech cocycle with respect to the Jacobian cov-
ering, which generalizes Carlson–Griﬃths’ result for smooth projective hypersurfaces in [4, Proposition,
page 7]:
Theorem 3.5. [12, Theorem 8.1] (Toric Carlson–Griﬃths Theorem in the Calabi–Yau case) Let PΣ be
an m-dimensional projective simplicial toric variety with anti-canonical class β ∈Cl(Σ). Let Xf be a
quasi-smooth ample hypersurface in PΣ of degree β = deg(f) ∈Cl(PΣ). For p ∈{0, 1, · · · , m −1} and
F(z) ∈Spβ, one has10

Now we specify a Calabi–Yau volume form ΩX on X = Xf(C) using Ω:

This implies that ΩX|Uj :=

fj for each j glues together to deﬁne a nowhere-vanishing holo-
morphic n-form ΩX on the Calabi–Yau manifold X. In other words, the volume form ΩX is given by

Proof. By [12, Corollary 7.2], we have (see [12, Corollary 7.1] for the deﬁnition of V β
j )
