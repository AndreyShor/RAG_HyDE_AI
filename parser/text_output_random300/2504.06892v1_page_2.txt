Increased power levels of coexisting
classical signals using 4 Lasers & EDFA
• Class 6-8: Different degrees of attenuation on the
quantum link.
The QBER/SKR data points are provided in sequen-
tial time steps, and thus, for each class, we have a long
time-series of data. The goal was to develop a system
that diagnoses the status of a QKD link in real-time, us-
ing only the latest N QBER and SKR data provided by
the system. To achieve this, we created N-plets of data
from the long time-series. We used 80% of these N-plets,
with N = 10, for training, while the remaining N-plets
were kept as test data. In the last column of Table I, we
report the total number of N-plets acquired experimen-
tally for each class.
To classify a test or new N-plet of data, a supervised
learning model must first be trained. We built [8] such
a modelan ML pipelineby assembling tsfresh [12], XG-
Boost [13], and a deep NN model, as shown in Fig. 1 (a).
The first component, tsfresh, extracts various statisti-
cal, frequency-domain, and model-based features from
the raw time series data (N-plets). From the k extracted
features, which are numerous (k = 1500 for N = 10), it
is necessary to extract the most important for the clas-
sification task under study. For the selection of the K
most important ones, we first train an XGBoost model
using all the (labeled) train data. After this step, each
N-plet of QBER/SKR data is ‘mapped’ to K-plet with
the values of these features estimated via tsfresh. In the
final step, we use the (labeled) K-plets to train a deep
NN with 3 hidden layers (K × 128 × 256 × 128 × 9) and
ReLU activation functions. The output layer of the NN
provides the probabilities for classifying an input data
point, train, or test, into one of the nine classes.
We set K = 5 and in Table I we report the classification
results from the ML pipeline ( Fig. 1 (a)) for the test
QKD/SKR data. In the following sections, we gradually
build a hybrid (quantum-classical) model by replacing
the deep NN in the pipeline with a VQC, as illustrated
in Fig. 1 (b).

classical ML model schematically described in Fig. 1 (a). The
hyperparameters of the ML model are chosen as N = 10 and

VQCS MADE OF QUDITS
In circuit-based quantum computation, qubits serve as
computational units, quantum gates implement the pro-
cessing, and projective measurements are used to extract
the outcomes.
Due to considerations related to quan-
tum error correction, the allowed operations are typi-
cally restricted to a universal set of gates, such as the
set formed by the Hadamard, Phase, and CNOT gates.
VQCs are quantum circuits which also include tunable
quantum gates. The parameterized gates within the cir-
cuit allow it to explore a range of quantum computational
models. This class of models is defined by the ansatz of
the circuit, which refers to the choice of parameterized
gates, fixed gates, and the architecture of the circuit.
A qubit describes the state of a discrete degree of free-
dom in a quantum system, which is quantized and yields
two distinct outcomes when measured. Qudits, on the
other hand, refer to quantum systems that provide d dis-
tinct outcomes upon measurement and naturally gener-
alize the concept of qubits.
In this work, for reasons
explained later in this section, we choose to use a VQC
built from a qudit, rather than using multiple qubits.
