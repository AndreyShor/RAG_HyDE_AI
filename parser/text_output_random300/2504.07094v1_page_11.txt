At the same time, longer and longer intervals are not
necessarily beneficial, as they would cover broader dy-
namic ranges of W, thus increasing the sampling depth
d required to cover the entire interval. Thus, the optimal
choice of m should be made by taking into account the
variation of W and the gaps of its argument.
To quantitatively assess the effect of sampling depth d
on reconstruction fidelity, we divided the 5, 000 collected
states for each interval into s non-overlapping blocks,
each comprising d microstates, with d ranging from 200
to 1250. Next, we obtained s independent reconstruc-
tions, W1, W2, ... , Ws, by using respectively only the
data from the first block of each interval, then from the
second block, etc.
We next considered the pointwise error of the profiles:
∆Wi(nq) = Wi(nq) −Wexact(nq) ,
(18)
and computed the mean and variance of these errors
across the s equivalent and independent reconstructions:
⟨∆W(nq)⟩= ⟨W(nq)⟩−Wexact(n)
Var [∆W(nq)] = ⟨∆W 2(nq)⟩−⟨∆W(nq)⟩2
(19)
= Var [W(nq)]
where ⟨.⟩denotes the average over the s block estimates.
Fig. 5b shows the results of the error analysis for the
representative bin nq = 50, corresponding to one of the
two midpoints of log(W). For clarity, the data are nor-
malized to the exact W value, Wexact(nq = 50). For all
considered ms, we observe that the ∆Wi values (data
points) are clustered around zero. In fact, their means
(solid lines) are compatible with zero within the esti-
mated error on the mean (shaded band), which is equal
to:
Var [⟨∆W(nq)⟩] = Var [∆W(nq)]
√s −1
(20)
Note that the results also establish that ⟨W⟩is compat-
ible with Wexact within the estimated error. Considering
that the latter can be calculated without reference Wexact
(see eq. 19), we conclude that multiple independent re-
constructions of the normalized W allow for computing
the associated statistical uncertainty in a reliable and un-
biased manner.
In addition, the third panel shows the error on the indi-
vidual reconstructions,
p
Var [∆W(nq)], which decreases
with the sampling depth for all ms.
APPENDIX B: MELT OF SELF-ASSEMBLED
RINGS WITH VARYING BENDING RIGIDITY
QUBO-based sampling of self-assembled ring melts
We consider ring melts that completely fill cubic lat-
tices of N index sites. A QUBO Hamiltonian for such
systems can be formulated in terms of two types of Ising-
like binary variables, hereafter indicated as Γ−and Γ⌞.
A Γ−
ij variable is attached to each lattice edge, ij, to in-
dicate whether a bond is present (1, active) or absent (0,
inactive) between neighboring sites i and j > i. Simi-
larly, a Γ⌞
ijk variable is assigned to each corner triplet of
sites, j being neighbor to both i and k > i. This variable
indicates whether the two incident edges ij and jk are
both occupied by bonds (1, active) or not (0, inactive).
FIG. 6. Example of QUBO encoding for space-filling
melts of ring polymers. (a) Symbolic representation of
QUBO binary variables corresponding to occupied/empty
bonds (Γ−
ij) and corner triplets (Γ⌞
ijk). (b) The represented
configuration is one of the possible ground state solutions of
the QUBO Hamiltonian of eq. 21 formulated for a 4×4 square
lattice and with the setting N = 16 to impose space-filling.
In this example, the total curvature (number of corner turn)
is nc = 12.
Using the above variables, the QUBO Hamiltonian for
the system reads [33]:

where the A coefficients are non-negative, P
⟨ij⟩and
P
⟨ijl⟩indicate summations over distinct neighboring
pairs and triplets of lattice sites, respectively.
The
prime indicates the restriction over inequivalent triplets,
⟨ijk⟩̸= ⟨ljm⟩.
The first quadratic term is minimized when the total
number of bonds (active edges) is equal to the number of
lattice sites N, as required by the space-filling condition
of the ring melt. The second term is a quadratic con-
straint that enforces the consistency of the Γ−and Γ⌞
variables. In fact, this term is minimized if and only if
the active corners of Γ⌞are compatible with the active
bonds of Γ−, i.e.,
