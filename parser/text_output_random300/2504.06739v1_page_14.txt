that az = 1.5a0 and the results are very similar to the case of
az = 1.2a0.
Appendix C: The mean-ﬁeld solutions using
diﬀerent cutoﬀschemes and site energies
Here we compare the mean-ﬁeld solutions obtained
by using diﬀerent cutoﬀschemes.

Moreover, we also
compare the results obtained by using diﬀerent on-site
f-electron energies:
E0 = −5 for the top panels and
E0 = −3 for the lower panels. Notice that the results
obtained by using az = 1.5a0 are very similar to the ones
by using az = 1.2a0.

Appendix D: Path integral approach and the

We start from the partition function of the studied
model system
