Hence, g is concave if and only if A(γ) is positive semi-deﬁnite. However, we have

Hence, P
¯ı∈I γ¯ı ≤1 implies the desired concavity.
However, considering the function t →
g(tc) = tλcγ gives λ = P
¯ı∈I γ¯ı, and concavity implies λ ≤1.
Putting the above results together, we can now prove Theorem 4.8.
Proof of Theorem 4.8. The proof is performed in several steps. First, we regularize and shift
the density by a positive constant and show the chain rule for that situation. Then follows the
harder part of estimating the limits. For this we rely on Proposition 6.3.
1. Step (Regularization):
We note that from the bound on the energy and dissipation, the
curve t 7→ρ(t) is absolutely continuous with values in (W1,∞(X))∗and it has a Lebesgue density
ρ dx for almost all t ∈[0, T]. Furthermore, we have ρ ∈Lpcrit([0, T] × X), f ∈L1(0, T, Ydiﬀ),
j ∈L1([0, T] × Yreact) by Proposition 5.8 and Proposition 5.5. Given σ > 0 and a molliﬁer
(kε)ε>0, we deﬁne the component-wise shifted and regularized trajectory
ρε,σ := (ρ + σ) ∗kε,
and correspondingly the regularized ﬂuxes f ε := f ∗kε and jε := j ∗kε. Clearly, (ρε,σ, f ε, jε) ∈
CE, where we have used that for the reactions the stoichiometric matrix Γ∗commutes with the
molliﬁcation. Moreover, we have
ρε,σ →ρ in L1([0, T] × X),
jε →j in L1([0, T] × Ydiﬀ),
f ε →f in L1([0, T] × Yreact).
2. Step (Chain rule for regularized curve):
Now, we show that for ﬁxed ε, σ > 0 the
trajectory t 7→E(ρε,σ(t)) is absolutely continuous and satisﬁes the upper chain rule. For this,
we ﬁrst note that there is a constant Mε > 0 such that ∥ρε,σ∥L∞([0,T]×Td) ≤Mε and we have
ρε,σ ≥σ > 0. To show absolute continuity, we ﬁx s, t ∈[0, T], and since on [σ, Mε + σ] the
Boltzmann function [σ, Mε + σ] ∋r 7→λB(r) ∈[0, ∞) is Lipschitz continuous, i.e., there is
Lσ,ε > 0 such that ∀r1, r2 ∈[σ, Mε + σ] :
|λ′
B(r1) −λ
′
B(r2)| ≤Lσ,ε|r1 −r2|, we compute
E(ρε,σ(t)) −E(ρε,σ(s)) ≤

The molliﬁer kε is a test function in C∞
c
with a (possibly bad) Lipschitz constant Cε, which
implies
E(ρε,σ(t)) −E(ρε,σ(s)) ≤CεLσ,ε∥ρ(t) −ρ(s)∥(W 1,∞)∗.
Hence, t 7→E(ρε,σ) is absolutely continuous, and we obtain by the diﬀerentiability of r 7→λB(r)
on [σ, Mε + σ] that
