predators, and hence living longer. The life expectancy
of B particles also sees a moderate increase, which we
also attribute to the biased movement of A away from
B, due to spreading (recall that A is the predator of B).
Figs. 13(e,f) shows the fraction of particles in the highest
hunger level and the number of particles in circular probe
areas. The results are similar to Figs. 11(b) and 12(e) for
the non-directional case, but again the effect is stronger.
Fig. 13(g,h) show correlation functions [comparable
with 12(c,d)]. An interesting feature is that cB,C(r) is
positive for intermediate distances r ≳15 and decays
to zero from above as r →∞.
To understand this,
note that the movement process (Fig. 1) allows particles
to swap places. Suppose that A and B are neighbours
which swap positions: then the bias for A to move away
from C means that B is biased towards C. This leads to
cB,C > 0 on these intermediate length scales. Comparing
Fig. 13(g,h) with Fig. 12(c,d), one also sees that the A, A
correlation is reduced by E&S for small distances (r ≲3)
due to the spreading.
Summarising, the E&S strategy is advantageous for
species A because evading predators increases life ex-
pectancy.
Spreading is advantageous because move-
ment into empty space increases the rate of reproduction
(which requires an empty adjacent site, recall Sec. V B).
These strategies increase A’s life expectancy without im-
pacting the population of their prey B, so that this
species (B) continues to predate on C, controlling their
population and reducing their ability to predate on A.
Note that these strategies benefit the entire population
of A and they also benefit individual particles, via in-
creased lifetime. However, each A particle predates less,
leading to higher hunger levels than one finds with the
non-directional (or symmetric) strategies.
C.
Evade strategy (crowded case)
For the crowded case (pω = 0.005), the evade strategy
is optimal [see Fig. 7]. This case is analysed in Fig. 14
(again for L = 120). This is comparable with Fig. 13,
as we now discuss.
Figure. 13(a,b) compares steady-
state snapshots of the null (symmetric) strategy and the
evade (E) strategy. One clearly sees that evasion leads
to a large A population, with very few of their predators
(C). The predation count and the life expectancy for the
evade strategy are shown in Fig. 14(c, d). The predation
count of A particles is slightly reduced while their life ex-
pectancy is significantly increased (due to the small num-
ber of their predators). Note that particles’ lifetimes are
limited by the spontaneous death process, so P(tlifetime

should decay at least as fast as P(tlifetime

at large times. The data are close to this limit, indicating
that predation by C plays a relatively small role, consis-
tent with the low C population [recall Fig. 7(b)]. On the
other hand, the null strategy has a faster-decaying tail,
indicating that predation is important.
The lifetime of B is also increased with respect to the
symmetric (null) case (more precisely, the large lifetime
tail is enhanced). This is presumably caused by the re-
duced predation rate by A (note σA = 0.4). The lifetime
