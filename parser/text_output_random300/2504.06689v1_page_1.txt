Abstract
Les Houches returned to an in-person format in 2023 and the bi-yearly tradition of updat-
ing the standard model precision wishlist has continued. In this work we review recent progress
(since Les Houches 2021) in fixed-order computations for LHC applications. In addition, nec-
essary ingredients for such calculations such as parton distribution functions, amplitudes, and
subtraction methods are discussed.
Finally, we indicate processes and missing higher-order
corrections that are required to reach the theoretical accuracy that matches the anticipated
experimental precision.
