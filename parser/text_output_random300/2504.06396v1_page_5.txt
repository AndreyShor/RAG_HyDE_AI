Fig. 2. Network topology based on [30]. This shows two different topologies, star, and radial, and how the
different substations would connect to the UCC.
nodes. The study presents various results and comparisons demonstrating the scalability of its
proposed cyber-physical power system model generation approach.
Similarly, in the 8-substation model [28], the cyber-physical system consists of four intercon-
nected networks: electrical, substation control, secondary substation, and control center. The
electrical power network includes the physical components that directly interface with Intelligent
Electronic Devices (IEDs). The substation control network contains the IEDs, while the secondary
substation network provides the cyber-physical link between the electrical power and substation
control networks. The control center network encompasses the Energy Management System (EMS)
and the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Each substation network has
its own Java-Object Oriented Notation (JSON) file, which defines nodes and links. These JSON files
include nodes such as switches, relays, breakers, buses, transformers, and generators.
Using an object-oriented approach and detailed communication nodes, the authors in [30] model
a star topology where all substations within a given region of the Texas grid connect to a Utility
Control Center (UCC). The placement of UCCs is determined by identifying a central node through
the K-nearest neighbor method, using the geographic coordinates of substations. The model also
includes a Regulatory Authority or Balancing Authority (BA) linked to all UCCs, with each site
incorporating communication infrastructure such as routers, firewalls, switches, and relays. In [24],
statistical metrics were collected from a simplified communication network topology based on a
realistic utility communication system presented in [6].

Communication Model Design
Fig. 2 delineates the architectural framework of the proposed communication model, illustrating
the network configurations for a UCC, a BA, and two distinct substation types: generation and
transmission. Fig. 2 demonstrates how these entities are interconnected using two prevalent Wide
Area Network (WAN) topologies: star and radial. Each substation is directly connected to the UCC
in the star topology, facilitating centralized control. Conversely, the radial topology employs a
hierarchical structure where generation substations link to transmission substations, which connect
to the UCC. The nuances and implications of these topologies and a third topology are further
elaborated in the subsequent subsection.
