Codimension-2 functionals from QCG
In this section, a couple of properties of the codimension-2 functional (2.22) are used as a
selection criterion of the corresponding gravity theory in the bulk from a general QCG.
3.1
Non-minimal surfaces and codimension-2 functionals
In Einstein gravity, the finiteness of the Renormalized Area (2.26) is spoiled when one
departs from minimality condition (2.24). Indeed, the anchoring points of non-minimal
surfaces, which intersect the conformal boundary at an arbitrary angle, generate new di-
vergent contributions from the IR sector of AAdS gravity.
In Ref. [29], Fischetti and Wiseman proposed a different energy functional, the so-
called reduced Hawking mass for Einstein–AdS spaces, which includes a correction due to
the extrinsic curvature, that is,
IH (Σ) ≡2

This functional is monotonic under an inverse mean curvature flow and it is finite for
generic surfaces.
Having in mind the relations (2.17)–(2.19), it is quite clear that a term of the type
KAKA in Eq.(3.1) cannot result from the application of the LM method to neither Einstein
gravity nor topological terms in the action. In contrast, the quadratic terms in the curvature
in QCG produce the generic surface functional

when evaluated on Einstein ambient spaces. To obtain a conical contribution from QCG
related to the reduced Hawking mass, one must impose the relation α = −β/3 in Eq. (3.2).
Under this condition, LQCG reduces in the Einstein sector to the form
LQCG [Σ, E] = β

which can be identified with the action of Conformal Gravity (CG) in four dimensions.
With the interest of rendering Weyl invariance manifest, it is convenient to express this
gravity action in terms of the Weyl tensor
