The first row (panels (a)–(e)) illustrates the evolution of resource distribution. Initially,
each player is assigned one unit of resources, and resource dynamics unfold rapidly. By
approximately 100 MCS (panels (b)–(d)), it becomes evident that resource distribution is
highly uneven. Once the system stabilizes, as shown in Fig. 11(e), the disparity is stark.
Fig. 11(A) provides a magnified view of a localized region in Fig. 11(e), where dark regions
(indicating individuals with fewer resources) dominate most of the system, while bright
spots (individuals with higher resources) are sparsely scattered, confirming the strong het-
erogeneity in resource redistribution. The second row (panels (f)–(j)) presents the evolution
of strategy configuration within ΥSDG and ΥPDG. Here, defectors are represented in dark
blue and blue for ΥSDG and ΥPDG, respectively, while cooperators are marked in red and
orange for ΥSDG and ΥPDG. At the beginning of the evolution, cooperators and defectors
are randomly distributed across the system. As the system evolves, the number of blue
and dark blue nodes first increases (panels (f) and (g)) before gradually declining, while red
and orange nodes proliferate, forming cooperative clusters. Upon stabilization, as seen in
Fig. 11(j), cooperators in ΥSDG (red) and ΥPDG (orange) form large cooperative clusters,
occupying most of the system, while defectors (blue and dark blue) become sparse and scat-
tered. Fig. 11(B) provides a magnified view of Fig. 11(j), highlighting how cooperators in
ΥPDG (orange) are predominantly positioned at the periphery of the cooperative clusters.
This spatial arrangement facilitates resource acquisition by ΥPDG cooperators from defec-
tors, while also benefiting ΥSDG cooperators by allowing them to access resources from those
in ΥPDG. The third row (panels (k)–(o)) shows the coevolution of strategies and resources,
distinguishing between richer and poorer groups within ΥSDG and ΥPDG. In the early stages
of evolution, the number of defectors (represented in purple, dark blue, magenta, and dodger
blue) initially increases before gradually declining, while cooperators (yellow-green, orange,
blue-green, and orange) follow the opposite trend, forming increasingly stable cooperative
clusters. Once the system reaches equilibrium, as shown in Fig. 11(o), cooperators in richer
groups within ΥSDG (orange) are primarily located inside cooperative clusters, while coop-
erators in poorer groups within ΥPDG (yellow-green) are mostly positioned along cluster
borders. Fig. 11(C) provides a magnified view of Fig. 11(o), illustrating how this spatial
distribution benefits cooperators: those at the cluster borders can extract resources from
nearby defectors, while those within richer groups in ΥSDG can reduce their own resource
losses and gain additional resources from other individuals.
