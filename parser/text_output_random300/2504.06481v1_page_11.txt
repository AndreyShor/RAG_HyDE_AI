above it. The more dramatic effect visible in Fig. 6 is that as the phase transition is crossed, the
total weight W in representations with low Casimir drops to almost zero. This occurs because
the maximal irreducible representation with
1
N TrRC2 = 1
4N2, not shown in the plot, starts to
become populated. This is the first order phase transition.

Figure 6: Probability distribution of the Casimir for values of Ω2N close to the phase
transition, calculated using the full partition function at N = 40. The vertical lines are statistical
error bars. The probabilities have been divided by the low Casimir weight W, which is the sum
of the probabilities for all values of the Casimir up to 5 (the upper end of the plot). The inset
shows the collapse of W as the transition is crossed.
Before elaborating on the spacetime interpretation of these low Casimir representations, we
briefly explain why the grand canonical ensemble — which we employed effectively in §3 — is
not useful to capture the high Casimir representations that dominate above the phase transition.
To describe these representations one must include the on-shell action (2), which becomes large.
Naïvely proceeding as in §3, one finds to leading exponential order that
⟨nM⟩≈e−βM+ 9Ω4
215 M3 .
(31)
The Boltzmann suppression in (31) is not enough to prevent unbounded growth of ⟨nM⟩at large
M. The unconstrained sum in (25) is therefore divergent for all β. This super-Hagedorn growth
is why the maximally irreducible representation so immediately becomes dominant above the
transition in Figs. 2 and 3. The grand canonical partition function can be salvaged by imposing
M ≤N. Such a cutoff is consistent with the fundamental constraint that the representations
must partition N, and leads to β ≈9Ω4
215 N2. However, this cutoff does not resolve the problem
because the dominance of configurations with M ∼N then produces a variance in N equal to
the expectation value squared: σ2
N ≡
∂2
∂β2 log eZ ≈P
M M2⟨nM⟩≈N2 . The grand canonical and
canonical ensembles are therefore not equivalent in this regime.
