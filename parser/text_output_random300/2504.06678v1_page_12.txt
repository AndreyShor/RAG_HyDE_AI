corresponding to U(1) symmetry group). The fiber bundle is a trivial bundle, whose topology is classified by the
Chen number,corresponding to the closed path; the fiber bundle with boundary is classified by the relative K-group,
corresponding to the non-closed path. The quasi-topological number corresponds to the mapping
K−1(X, ∂X) ≃Z
[E] 7−→νweak
(S29)
where[E]is the equivalent class of tangent space vector bundle. The Atiyah-Singer index theorem shows that the
mapping is homomorphic. The wave function |ψ(λ)⟩is defined on the U(1) principal bundle P(M, U(1)) on the
parameter space M, with the modified Berry connection corresponding to the connection on the bundle, and the
modified Berry curvature corresponding to the bundle curvature. According to the Chern-Weil theorem, the integral
quantization of the first Chern class c1 ∈H2(M, Z):

c1 ∈Z
(S30)
Thus, the quasi-topological number must be an integer and is the difference between the Chern number of the initial
and final states. Now verify the property of gauge invariance:
|ψ(λ)⟩→eiθ(λ) |ψ(λ)⟩
(S31)
Berry connection transformation: Aµ →Aµ + ∂µθ ensures gauge invariance.

HIGHER-ORDER QUASI-TOPOLOGY AND EXTENDED HOMOTOPY THEORY
4.1
Homotopy Structure and Relative Homotopy Group of Path Space
Set the parameter space to be a compact manifold M, and consider the set of paths C(M; ∂M) with endpoints
fixed on the submanifolds ∂M. Define the relative homology group:
π1(M, ∂M) = {[γ] | γ : [0, 1] →M, γ(0), γ(1) ∈∂M}
where [γ] denotes the homotopy class of the path γ. Two paths γ1, γ2 belong to the same homology class if they are
continuously deformable and their endpoints remain fixed.
4.2
Stratified Fiber Bundle and Connection Structures
We lift the parameter space to the principal fiber bundle P(M, U(1)), with the projection mapping π : P →M.
For non-closed paths γ ∈C(M; ∂M), define stratified Berry connection:
Aµ(λ) = i⟨ψ(λ)|∂µψ(λ)⟩+ κµ(λ)
where κµ is a compensating field satisfying:
I
γ
κµdλµ = 0
to ensure that the path integral is independent of the reference frame. The Berry curvature is:
Fµν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ
4.3
Quantization of Relative quasi-topological Number
For two paths C1, C2, the relative quasi-topological number of the enclosed region S = C1 −C2:
νqua = 1
2π
ZZ
S
Fµνdλµ ∧dλν
The curvature integral satisfies according to the Chern-Weil theorem:
1
2π
ZZ
S
F ∈Z
thus νqua ∈Z. Physical meaning: The topological response of a non-closed path is determined by the Chern number
of the enclosed region, concerning the road details are irrelevant.
