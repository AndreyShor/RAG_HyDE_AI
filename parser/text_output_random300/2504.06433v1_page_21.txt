Case 1: G(2)
0
does not touch one of the qubits 1, 2, or 3.
WLOG, 3 /∈S. By Lemma 5.3
(with r := 2 and U1 := G(0.5)
{1,2}), we can choose an initial pure parity state |ψ⟩∈H{1,2} (of pure
parity 0, say) of qubits 1 and 2 that turns G(1)
1
oﬀ, regardless of the initial state of the other qubits.
But then, qubit 3 has no connection to the target at all, and so the ﬁnal state of the target is
independent of the third input bit, regardless of the rest of the input bits and the initial state of
the ancilla. Particularly, for any b ∈{0, 1}, let the initial state of the circuit be
|0⟩⊗|ψ⟩⊗|b⟩⊗|0⟩⊗(n−3) ⊗|α⟩.
(We set the third input qubit to |b⟩and input qubits 4, . . . , if any, to |0⟩.) Then the ﬁnal state of
the circuit is of the form |0⟩⊗|τb⟩, where |τb⟩is the ﬁnal state of the non-target qubits. |τb⟩may
depend on b, but the ﬁnal state of the target does not, and thus C does not weakly compute ⊗n.
Case 2: G(2)
0
touches all of the qubits 1, 2, and 3 (i.e., not Case 1).
That is, {1, 2, 3} ⊆S.
By Lemma 5.3 (with r := 3,
U1 := G(0.5)
{1,2,3}, and U2 := G(1.5)
{1,2,3}U1), for each b ∈{0, 1} we can
choose an initial state |ψb⟩∈H{1,2,3} with pure parity b on qubits 1, 2, and 3 that turns G(1)
1
and G(2)
0
both oﬀ, regardless of the initial state of the other qubits. Thus given the initial state
|0⟩⊗|ψb⟩⊗|0⟩⊗(n−3) ⊗|α⟩, the target has no connection to the ﬁrst three input qubits, so its ﬁnal
value cannot depend on b. Since the initial state |ψb⟩⊗|0⟩⊗(n−3) of the input qubits has pure
parity b, C does not weakly compute ⊗n.
Lemma 6.8. G(1)
0
can only touch at most one input qubit.
Proof. Suppose some G(1)
0
= CT Z, where T includes the target and at least two other input qubits.
WLOG, {0, 1, 2} ⊆T. By Lemma 5.3 (with r := 2 and U1 := G(0.5)
{1,2}), for each b ∈{0, 1}, we can
choose an initial state |ψb⟩of pure parity b on qubits 1 and 2 that turns G(1)
0
oﬀ, regardless of the
initial state of the other qubits. For each b, set the initial state of the other input qubits to all |0⟩,
resulting in an initial state

:= |0⟩⊗|ψb⟩⊗|0⟩⊗(n−2) ⊗|α⟩
where |α⟩is the initial state of the ancilla qubits.
Since |ψ′
b⟩turns G(1)
0
oﬀ, the target is not
connected to any other qubits before layer 2. Applying G(1.5)G(1)G(0.5) to |ψ′
b⟩thus results in a
state

{1,2} |ψb⟩, and |ϕ⟩B is the state of the qubits in B and is independent of b. Figure 2 shows
in a typical case how the circuit C simpliﬁes before layer 2 on initial state |ψ′
b⟩. Note that |ϕb⟩
separates at {{0}, {0}}.
Since the initial state |ψb⟩⊗|0⟩⊗(n−2) of the input qubits has pure parity b, the ﬁnal state of
C must be of the form |b⟩⊗|τ⟩for some |τ⟩∈H{0}, and thus separates at {{0}, {0}}. It follows
by running |b⟩⊗|τ⟩backwards through layer 2.5 (which contains only 1-qubit gates) that the state
|ϕ′
b⟩of the qubits immediately after layer 2 also separates at {{0}, {0}}. Therefore, the states |ϕb⟩
