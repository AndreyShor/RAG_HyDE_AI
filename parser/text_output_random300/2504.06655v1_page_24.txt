Figure 1: a) A simple schematic of the quantum dot interface in solution, the electric double 
layer, and the associate potentials as a function of Z, the distance from the surface. Φ0 is the 
surface potential b)Interface not being isotropic can cause interference in the signal generated 
from different layers resulting in phase mismatch (∆kz). c)Variation of Surface potential, and 
inverse Debye length (κ = λ −1) with respect to ionic strength d)Variation of Phase angle (ϕ) with 
respect to phase mismatch and inverse Debye length.
