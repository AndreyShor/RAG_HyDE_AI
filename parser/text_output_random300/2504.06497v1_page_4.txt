Quantum Gates and Circuits: Quantum operations are implemented through quantum
gates, such as the Hadamard gate (which introduces superposition), the CNOT gate (which
entangles qubits), and the Toffoli gate (which implements controlled operations). These
gates form quantum circuits, which execute quantum algorithms by manipulating qubits
through sequences of unitary transformations [22].
Quantum Measurements: Unlike classical measurements, quantum measurements proba-
bilistically collapse a quantum state into a definite classical outcome. This probabilistic
nature introduces inherent uncertainty but also enables novel computational paradigms,
such as quantum-enhanced optimization and cryptographic protocols.
Quantum Entanglement: Quantum data can encode complex correlations through entan-
glement, enabling applications like quantum key distribution (QKD), secure multi-party
computation, and quantum-enhanced communication protocols [23].
Quantum Keys and Cryptographic Data: Quantum cryptography leverages quantum data
to generate secure cryptographic keys using protocols such as BB84 [24] and E91 [25].
These quantum-generated keys provide security against eavesdropping due to the no-cloning
theorem and quantum measurement principles [26].
Additionally, emerging fields such as quantum image processing and quantum video encoding ex-
tend quantum data representations to visual and multimedia domains, potentially revolutionizing
fields like quantum-enhanced artificial intelligence and secure quantum communication networks.
As quantum computing advances, efficient quantum data representation and encoding methods
are becoming increasingly crucial. This study explores how quantum data encoding techniques
can be leveraged to enhance classical machine learning models, improving feature transformations
and enabling more expressive representations within hybrid quantum-classical frameworks.

Literature Review
The integration of quantum computing with classical machine learning has been an area of grow-
ing interest, offering potential advancements in data processing and computational efficiency
[27]. This literature review explores key developments in quantum data encoding techniques
and their intersection with classical machine learning, focusing on foundational concepts, recent
contributions, and prevailing challenges.
Quantum data encoding plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between classical and quantum
computing. Early contributions to this domain can be traced back to Feynman’s seminal work
on quantum simulations, which highlighted the potential of quantum systems to model complex
physical phenomena more efficiently than classical counterparts [1]. This laid the groundwork for
subsequent research in quantum computing, particularly in quantum algorithms and encoding
techniques.
Preskill’s introduction of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices marked a significant
milestone, emphasizing the feasibility of near-term quantum computers in solving computational
problems [2]. This era of quantum computing has witnessed considerable advancements in quan-
tum data encoding, enabling the application of quantum techniques to classical machine learning
models.
