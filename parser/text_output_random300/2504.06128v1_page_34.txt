The proof is complete.

Remark 4.8 (Sub-critical regime). In the sub-critical regime (1.26), we need to modify
(4.48) to:

in agreement with the variance (4.47).
Step 6. Proof of (4.13) and (4.12). We will apply the Central Limit Theorem for
arrays of martingale differences. In particular, we will make use of the following special
version of [HH80, Theorem 3.5].
Theorem 4.9. For each n ě 1, let pSn,iq1ďiďMn be a mean zero square integrable martingale
adapted to the filtration pFn,iq1ďiďMn. Let ∆n,i :“ Sn,i ´ Sn,i´1 be the associated martingale
differences. Denote

Assume that

Then the following three statements are equivalent:

In our setting, the first condition in (4.51) follows from Theorem 4.5 (note the uniformity
over FNi in the convergence therein) by choosing MN Ñ 8 slowly enough and then applying
a Riemann sum approximation that shows σ2 “

The second condition in (4.51) follows from the higher moment estimate (4.48) and a
union bound as follows:
