FEBID is an electron-assisted chemical deposition technique that enables high-resolution patterning in a single step.52
a combination of high and low molecular weight PMMA gen-
erates an undercut during development, aiding the lift-off pro-
cess.
ZEP: ZEP ER54 boasts three times the sensitivity of
PMMA, offering similar resolution while reducing EBL writ-
ing time. Additionally, a single layer of ZEP achieves the
desired undercut when exposed at 1.5 times the clearing dose,
streamlining the lift-off procedure and obviating the need for
a bilayer resist. Another viable option is CSAR-62, a chemi-
cally semi-amplified resist56, thrice as sensitive as PMMA and
more cost-effective than ZEP, making it a feasible choice for
ASI fabrication.
The key process steps routinely employed to obtain mag-
netic nanostructures are outlined below [Fig. 3(b)]:
1. Spin coat an ER onto a substrate (e.g., silicon wafer).
2. Expose the ER using EBL.
3. Develop the ER in an appropriate solution.
4. Deposit a magnetic thin film (typically 3-25 nm thick)
or multilayer onto the patterned substrate.
5. Strip off the remaining resist by immersion in an appro-
priate chemical solution.

Other approaches for fabricating ASI, including 3D ASI:
Two-Photon Lithography (TPL):
Recently, two-photon lithography (TPL) has become one of
the most widely used high-resolution techniques for fabricat-
ing intricate 3D structures with nanoscale precision, making
it an ideal method for creating 3D ASI samples57–61. The
methodology of TPL involves the following key steps [Fig.
3(c)]:
Preparation of the photopolymer resist: A photosensitive
resist is chosen that allows fine-resolution polymerization
under two-photon absorption. The resist typically contains
monomers and photoinitiators that react to femtosecond laser
pulses. The material needs to be compatible with the deposi-
tion of magnetic material in subsequent steps.
Design of the spin ice structure: The ASI design involves
a lattice of magnetic islands that act as individual “spins”.
These islands are arranged in a predefined 3D grid pattern.
CAD software is used to design the geometry of the islands
and their spatial arrangement, ensuring the structure mimics
the characteristics of a spin ice material.
Laser system setup: A femtosecond laser with an appropri-
ate wavelength (800 nm – 1030 nm, typically Ti:Sapphire) is
selected to induce two-photon absorption in the resist. The
laser is focused through a high-numerical aperture objective
lens to create a highly localized polymerization spot. By scan-
ning the focused laser across the resist, the desired 3D pattern
of the spin ice structure is written, one layer at a time.
Two-photon polymerization: The laser pulses induce two-
photon absorption only at the focal point, where the light in-
tensity is sufficiently high, leading to localized polymeriza-
tion. Owing to the nonlinear nature of this process, polymer-
ization is confined exclusively to that focal region. By pre-
cisely controlling the movement of either the laser beam or the
sample stage in three dimensions (X, Y, and Z), the structure is
written point by point or line by line within the resist, allowing
for the fabrication of high-resolution polymerized 3D islands
that form the ASI lattice. The laser intensity, scanning speed,
and exposure duration are controlled to define the dimensions
of each island and ensure accurate positioning.
Post-exposure development:
After the microstructure is
written, the sample undergoes a development process where
the unpolymerized resist is washed away, leaving behind the
polymerized 3D structure. The sample is then dried using crit-
ical point drying (CPD) to prevent structural collapse.
Magnetic material deposition: To create the artificial spins,
the polymerized 3D structure is coated with a thin layer of
ferromagnetic material such as Co or NiFe using techniques
like sputtering or electrodeposition. Nickel can also be de-
posited by atomic layer deposition to provide excellent con-
formal coverage19. A lift-off process (if needed) is used to
remove excess metal, leaving behind the ASI nanostructures.
The magnetic islands are then magnetized to establish their
