In this letter, we do not aim to provide a deﬁnitive solu-
tion to both of the aforementioned issues simultaneously.
Instead, we focus on (ii), by proposing a novel alternative
formulation of standard supersymmetric ﬁeld theory with
a ﬁnite number of ﬁelds, in which susy is reduced using
the Dressing Field Method (DFM). Originally introduced
in [23] as a systematic approach to constructing gauge-
invariant variables, the DFM is best framed within the
diﬀerential bundle geometry of ﬁeld space [24], but it also
admits a more broadly accessible ﬁeld-theoretic presen-
tation [25–27]. A key aspect of this method, particularly
when applied using ﬁeld-dependent dressing ﬁelds, is its
relational nature: gauge invariance is achieved by realiz-
ing the physical d.o.f. as relations among bare (gauge-
variant) ones [24–26, 28–30].
By leveraging this approach we make invariance man-
ifest through the construction of relational susy singlets,
thereby defusing the issue of susy transformations closing
and forming an algebra only on-shell.
The remaining of this work is thus organized as follows:
In Section (II) we brieﬂy recall the basics of the DFM and
its application to the reduction of susy – while we refer
the interested reader to the above cited literature on the
DFM for further technical and conceptual details. In Sec-
tion III we present our novel approach to oﬀ-shell susy
invariance via the DFM. The procedure applies at both
the kinematical and the dynamical levels. We also pro-
vide an example of application to an N-extended model,
that is N = 2, D = 4 pure sugra in its geometric (a.k.a.
rheonomic) formulation in superspace [31] – the dressing
will be perturbative and invariance achieved at 1st order.
Finally, in Section IV we discuss future developments and
propose novel possible approaches to addressing point (i)
using a ﬁnite number of ﬁelds.

DRESSING FIELD METHOD: BASICS
Via the DFM [24–26, 28–30, 32, 33] one produces
gauge-invariants out of the ﬁelds Φ = {φ} of a gauge the-
ory with gauge group H whose action on Φ deﬁnes gauge
transformations: φ 7→φg. In the standard formulation
of the DFM, which we review below, one ﬁrst studies the
kinematics (and then the dynamics) of a theory based on
a given gauge group, for which the transformations that
form a closed group, or an algebra, are given a priori.
Suppose K ⊆H is a gauge subgroup – corresponding
to the rigid K ⊆H. The DFM relies on identifying a
Φ-dependent K-dressing ﬁeld, that is a map
u : Φ →Dr[K, K],
φ 7→u = u[φ],
φk 7→uk := u[φk] = k−1u[φ],
∀k ∈K,
(1)
where Dr[K, K] := {u : U ⊂M →K | uk = k−1u} is
the space of (Φ-independent) dressing ﬁelds, with M the
spacetime manifold. One can then build in a systematic
way, using the DFM rule of thumb – cf. e.g. [24], the
K-invariant dressed ﬁelds by the surjective map
Φ →Φu,
φ 7→φu = φu[φ],
φk 7→(φk)uk := (φk)k−1u[φ] = φu[φ].
(2)
By this rule, to obtain the dressing of an object, one
ﬁrst computes its gauge transformation, then one (for-
mally) substitutes the gauge parameter with u in the
result. Note, however, that the dressing ﬁeld is not an
element of the gauge group. The DFM has a natural re-
lational interpretation: Dressed ﬁelds φu represent the
gauge-invariant, physical relations among d.o.f. embed-
ded in the original (bare) ﬁelds φ.
Here let us also mention that, being K-invariant, the
dressed ﬁelds φu are expected to display residual trans-
formations under what remains of the gauge group. If
K is a normal subgroup of H, K ⊳H, then H/K =: J
is a Lie group. Correspondingly, K ⊳H and J = H/K is
a gauge subgroup of H. In this case, the dressed ﬁelds
φu may exhibit well-deﬁned residual J -gauge transfor-
mations, which are called residual transformations of the
1st kind. Furthermore, dressed objects may also exhibit
residual transformations resulting from a possible ambi-
guity in the choice of dressing ﬁeld: two dressing ﬁelds
u, u′ may a priori be related by u′ = uξ, where ξ is an
element of what is referred to as the group of residual
transformations of the 2nd kind.
A.
Perturbative dressing
It may often happen, as is typically the case in super-
symmetric ﬁeld theory, that one is chieﬂy concerned with
invariance at 1st order, that is under inﬁnitesimal gauge
transformations LieH. In this case, one may linearise the
above, deﬁning a LieK-dressing ﬁeld
υ = υ[φ] : U ⊂M →K = LieK,
s.t.
δλυ := υ[δλφ] ≈−λ,
∀λ ∈LieK,
(3)
where in the deﬁning transformation higher-order terms,
polynomial in λ and υ, are neglected. We then deﬁne the
perturbatively dressed ﬁelds
φυ := φ + ¯δυφ,
(4)
where ¯δυφ mimics the functional expression of the LieH
gauge transformation δλφ, substituting the gauge param-
eter by the inﬁnitesimal dressing, λ →υ. This is again
the rule of thumb mentioned above. So, ¯δυ is not a diﬀer-
ential of the algebra of ﬁelds. The perturbatively dressed
ﬁelds are K-invariant at 1st order,
δλ(φυ) = δλφ + ¯δ(δλυ)φ = δλφ + ¯δ−λφ
= δλφ −δλφ ≡0,
(5)
that is neglecting higher-order terms in λ and υ.
