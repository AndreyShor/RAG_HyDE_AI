between the conductor and the electrodes. The detailed influence of the coupling 
strength on the line shape of the transmission spectra has been extensively discussed 
in earlier works, and therefore, it is not elaborated here. 
Another notable observation is that the transmission probabilities for up-spin and 
down-spin electrons are exactly identical across the entire energy range considered. 
Consequently, the spin polarization, which measures the difference between up and 
down spin transmissions, remains exactly zero throughout. Thus, a disorder-free con-
ductor yields a vanishing spin polarization.

  We now turn our attention to the correlated disordered system, which forms the 
core of our study. Our primary objective is to explore the intricate interplay among 
disorder, electron-electron interaction, and electron-phonon coupling. In line with the
