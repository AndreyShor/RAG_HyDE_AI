Fig. 1. Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams (HRDs) containing our sample of the Galaxy (left), LMC (middle), and SMC (right). Overlaid are stel-
lar evolution tracks computed with the standard wind mass-loss rates (see Sect. 4.4 and Appendix B) and an initial rotational velocity of
3rot,ini = 100 km s−1. The individual stars are color-coded based on their current spectroscopic mass, corrected for the effects of centrifugal force.
6. To avoid including potential, not yet discovered post-
interaction binary stars, it is required that the spectroscopic
mass (corrected for centrifugal force) of main-sequence stars
must agree within a factor of ∼1.5 with the evolutionary
mass. For stars lacking a spectroscopic mass estimate (e.g.,
WR stars), an orbital mass estimate is required for inclusion.
7. The star must exhibit clear wind features in the UV or opti-
cal. For our sample, this corresponds to Γe ≳0.1.
8. For stars with optically thin winds (e.g., no or weak
Hα emission), mass-loss rates must be derived from UV
wind features. For stars with optically thick winds (e.g., WR
stars or supergiants), mass-loss rates derived from optical
spectra are accepted.
It is well established that stellar winds are inhomogeneous.
In stellar atmosphere codes, inhomogeneities are typically mod-
eled using the “microclumping” approach, which assumes that
the wind consists of optically thin clumps. The density enhance-
ment of the clumps relative to a smooth wind with the same
mass-loss rate can be characterized by a density contrast param-
eter D (e.g., Hillier 1991; Hamann & Koesterke 1998). The re-
sulting degeneracy of the clumping factor and the mass-loss rate
can be broken by employing both UV and optical wind diagnos-
tic lines. While in many spectral analyses included in our sam-
ple, the effect of microclumping is accounted for, some studies
that only rely on optical spectra assume a smooth wind (D = 1).
However, numerous investigations have shown that the winds of
OB-type stars are modeled the best with a clumping factor of
D = 10 (e.g., Šurlan et al. 2013; Verhamme et al. 2024; Sander
et al. 2024). Therefore, in cases where a mass-loss rate was pro-
vided for a smooth wind, the rates were corrected in a simple-
minded way to the mass-loss rates of a star with a clumped wind
assuming a clumping factor D = 10, by using
log( ˙M/( M⊙yr−1)) = log( ˙Msmooth/( M⊙yr−1)) −log(
√
D).

Following a comprehensive literature review, our final sam-
ple comprises 70 stars from our Galaxy (GAL), 61 from
the LMC, and 57 from the SMC. The sample includes OB-
type main-sequence stars (log (g [cm s−2])
>
3.8), OB-type
giants and supergiants (log (g [cm s−2]) < 3.8), Wolf-Rayet
stars, and recently identified partially stripped stars with ro-
bust mass-loss estimates. As such, the sample spans a wide
temperature range (T ≈12 kK – 100 kK) and initial masses
(Mini ≈15 M⊙– 150 M⊙) (see Fig.1). Detailed stellar and wind
parameters for the sample, along with references, are provided
in Tables A.1 to A.5.
3. Results
3.1. The strong winds of post-interaction binaries
Recently, a new class of post-interaction binaries has been iden-
tified in the SMC (Pauli et al. 2022; Rickard & Pauli 2023; Ra-
machandran et al. 2023, 2024). Their detailed multi-wavelength
and multi-epoch spectroscopic analyses revealed that the par-
tially stripped stars in these systems have OB spectral type but
exhibit mass-loss rates several orders of magnitude higher than
those of “normal” OB-type stars with similar luminosities (see
left panel of Fig. 2). In fact, stellar winds of O-type partially
stripped stars are in the same regime as winds of WR stars.
As previously noted, the luminosity-to-mass ratio, and as
such the Eddington factor Γe, is of major importance in determin-
ing the strength of a stellar wind. When comparing the mass-loss
rates of partially stripped stars to those of OB and WR stars as a
function of Γe (see right panel of Fig. 2), rather than a function
of L (left panel of Fig. 2), a notable trend emerges. This suggests
that the strong winds of partially stripped stars are a consequence
of their enhanced luminosity-to-mass ratios, and that a differenti-
ation between the winds of OB-type, stripped, partially stripped
non-WR and WR star is not needed.
The recent discoveries of (fully) stripped intermediate-mass
helium stars by Drout et al. (2023) show much weaker mass-loss
rates than the partially stripped stars (Götberg et al. 2023). Their
stripped stars have lower Eddington parameters and the upper
limits on their mass-loss rates align with the shown mass-loss
relation. This implies that the low and high mass-loss rates of
fully and partially stripped stars can be explained by their change
in Γe during their evolution.
