the N(1710)1/2+, N(1880)1/2+, N(1900)3/2+, N(1895)1/2−, N(2060)5/2−, ∆(1910)1/2+ and
∆(1920)3/2+ resonances have been taken into account to reproduce the available data for both
γn →K0Σ0 and γn →K+Σ−reactions.
Apart from the N(1710)1/2+ which is marked as
”seen” in its decay branching ratio to the KΣ channel, all the other considered resonances
have sizable branching ratios in PDG [19].
In this work, we disregard the N(1895)1/2−and
N(2060)5/2−, as their contributions are negligible when considering molecules, and we retain the
other five resonances: N(1710)1/2+, N(1880)1/2+, N(1900)3/2+, ∆(1910)1/2+ and ∆(1920)3/2+.
Third, to achieve satisfactory numerical results, we refer to the analyses in Refs. [43, 44] and add
seven additional resonances that may have significant contributions: N(1675)5/2−, N(1720)3/2+,
∆(1600)3/2+, ∆(1700)3/2−, ∆(1900)1/2−, ∆(1930)5/2−and ∆(1940)3/2−. In summary, besides
the ground states N and ∆, there are seven molecules, five general N∗resonances and seven ∆∗
resonances considered in s-channel of our theoretical model, which are listed in Table II.
Fig. 1(b) illustrates the t-channel, which includes exchanges of K and K∗(892) as considered in
Refs. [40, 41], along with the K1(1270), which may also contribute. Fig. 1(c) depicts the u-channel
with only the exchange of the bound state Σ. As noted in Ref. [45], adding more resonances in the
u-channel did not materially improve the result. Therefore, we neglect other baryon exchanges in
the u-channel to reduce the number of fit parameters in our theoretical model, providing a cleaner
background for testing the effects of molecules. Additionally, Fig. 1(d) presents the interaction
current, which is modeled by a generalized contact current to ensure the gauge invariance of the
