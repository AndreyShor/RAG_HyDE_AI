In terms of the shifted propagators, the BCOV ring takes the form
∂z eSzz =Czzz eSzz eSzz + 2eSz −2sz
zz eSzz + hzz

∂z eSz =Czzz eSzz eSz + 2eS −sz

together with ∂Fg/∂Kz = 0. The equation can be integrated after calculating the right-hand
side of (A.14) and collecting the terms with the same order in Kz.
The entire anti-holomorphic dependence of the free energies is then absorbed in the
propagators eSzz, eSz and eS.
Moreover, if one associates to these propagators respective
weights 1, 2, 3, one can show that the genus g free energy Fg for g ≥2 is a polynomial in
the propagators of weight 3g −3 with coeﬃcients that are rational functions in z [80, 81].
The term of weight zero in Fg is called the holomorphic ambiguity fg(z) and has to be
determined, for example, using the behavior of Fg at boundaries of the moduli space and
known Gopakumar-Vafa invariants, as described in Section 3.4.
Finally, let us summarize the behavior of the ambiguities under K¨ahler transformations
Kz →Kz −∂z log fK(z) ,
̟0(z) →fK(z)̟0(z) ,
