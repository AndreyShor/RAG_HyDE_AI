Appendix A: Notation
Let {|0⟩, |1⟩} denote the standard basis of a qubit
Hilbert space H (sometimes called the Z basis), |±⟩:=
(|0⟩± |1⟩)/
√
2 denote the so-called Hadamard basis, and
H := |+⟩⟨0| + |−⟩⟨1| represent the Hadamard gate.
Let X = |0⟩⟨1| + |0⟩⟨1|, Y
= i|0⟩⟨1| −i|0⟩⟨1|, and
Z = |0⟩⟨0|−|1⟩⟨1|, together with the 2×2 identity, I, de-
note the Pauli matrices P. Any two square matrices P, Q
are said to commute when PQ = QP and anti-commute
when PQ = −QP. Note any two Pauli matrices either
commute or anti-commute.
The qubit X-dephasing (bit flip) channel,
Dq(ρ) = (1 −q)ρ + qXρX,
(A1)
applies the Pauli X operator with probability 0 ≤q ≤
1/2. The qubit depolarizing channel,
Λp(ρ) = (1 −p)ρ + p
3(XρX + Y ρY + ZρZ),
= (1 −4
3p)ρ + 4p
3 Tr(ρ) I
2,
(A2)
applies Pauli X, Y, and Z operators with equal proba-
bility p/3 and the identity operator I with probability
1 −p where 0 ≤p ≤1. We use I to denote the identity
channel, I(ρ) = ρ for all operators ρ.
The fidelity of a two-qubit density operator ρ with the
maximally entangled state,
|ϕ⟩= (|00⟩+ |11⟩)/
√
2,
(A3)
is what we call the Bell fidelity, F := ⟨ϕ|ρ|ϕ⟩.
The
Bell fidelity can be estimated directly from Pauli mea-
surements (see App. B). We refer to 1 −F as the infi-
delity with the Bell state (A3). The two-qubit CNOT
gate with 0th qubit as control and first qubit as target is
CNOT01 = |0⟩⟨0| ⊗I + |1⟩⟨1| ⊗X.
The tensor product of Pauli matrices P on n-qubits is
sometimes called a Pauli string. We use a compressed
notation to represent such a string by suppressing the
identity matrix and using subscript to denote the system
label. For instance with n = 3 we denote Z ⊗I ⊗X by
Z0X2.
Appendix B: Direct Bell fidelity estimation
A two-qubit state, ρ, has Bell fidelity,
F = ⟨ϕ|ρ|ϕ⟩= 1
4(1 + ⟨ZZ⟩ρ + ⟨XX⟩ρ −⟨Y Y ⟩ρ)
(B1)
where ⟨N⟩ρ := Tr(Nρ). The Bell fidelity can be com-
puted by measuring expectation value of ZZ, XX, and
Y Y operators. To compute ⟨ZZ⟩ρ one may measure each
qubit of ρ in the Z basis, obtain probabilities pij for mea-
surement outcome corresponding to basis |ij⟩and then
evaluate ⟨ZZ⟩ρ = 2(p00 + p11) −1.
Expectation values for XX and Y Y can be computed
in an analogous manner by measuring qubits in the X
and Y basis instead of Z. Thus, to measure the Bell fi-
delity this way one does three different measurement ex-
periments, one for each Pauli measurement basis. Given
a circuit for measuring a qubit in the Z basis one can
measure in the X and Y basis by applying H and H ·S†,
respectively, prior to measuring in the Z basis, where
S = diag(1, −i) is
√
Z.
Appendix C: A general protocol for distillation
Both recurrence and the ZX3B protocols in Sec. II of
the main text can be viewed as special cases of those
in [54, 55]. These distillation protocols can be viewed in
a unified way using a slightly different notation as follows.
Let HAi and HBi each be a qubit Hilbert space, Hi :=
HAi⊗HBi be a two-qubit Hilbert space, HA := ⊗n
i=1HAi
and HB := ⊗n
i=1HBi each be n-qubit Hilbert spaces, and
ρAB be a 2n-qubit state. To distill a single two-qubit
state from ρAB one applies some unitary U = UA⊗UB to
ρAB then post-selects for agreement on Z measurements
made on 2(n −1) qubits. Let the unmeasured system be
labeled 0. To describe the post-selected state consider
T = I0 ⊗L where I0 is the identity on H0, L = ⊗n−1
i=1 Pi,
and Pi = |00⟩⟨00| + |11⟩⟨11| is a projector defined on Hi.
The post-selection succeeds with probability
pa = Tr(TUρU †T †)
(C1)
and results in a state
ρ′ = 1
pa
Tri̸=0(TUρU †T †),
(C2)
where the partial trace is over all spaces Hi except i = 0.
The fidelity of the post-selected state is
F = Tr(ρ′ϕ).
(C3)
Appendix D: Distilled fidelity calculation
As explained at the end of Sec. II, the recurrence pro-
tocol post-selects away errors on qubits 2 and 3 that anti-
commute with Z2Z3. This idea can be used to compute
the final fidelity Fa in (5) and acceptance probability ps
in (6). In Fig. 1a, suppose
ρ02 = I ⊗Pp(ρ)
and
ρ13 = I ⊗Pq(ρ),
(D1)
where Pp(ρ) := pIρ+pxXρX+pyY ρY +pzZρZ is a qubit
Pauli channel, each pi ≥0, and P
i∈{I,x,y,z} pi = 1. The
