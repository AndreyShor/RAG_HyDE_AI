FIG. 5. The time required for the system with active noise, where the mean jump size is 0.1, to reach a non-equilibrium steady
state is significantly extended.
FIG. 6. Schematic of the ABP-polymer composite system: A central ABP (red) connects to m Rouse chains (m = 4 shown) of
n Brownian particles each. The system represents a minimal model for active particles in polymeric environments.
while the other three directions share an equal probability of 0.1 each.
The boundary conditions for the arms in our study are the pinned arms where the last n-th beads in the arms are
fixed in space, i.e., Γ

l ∈{1, · · · , m}. We consider the cases where m = 3, 4 and n = 1, 3, 7. We set the
initial state of the system to follow a Gaussian distribution, where the mean configuration ensures a distance of 0.5
between adjacent particles, and the covariance matrix is specified as the identity matrix. Fig. 7 shows the entropy
production for the active polymer system with m = 3, 4 arms, where each arm consists of n = 1, 3, 7 Brownian beads
and a fixed end bead in a 2D plane. As the number of arms and beads increases, the time required for the system to
reach the steady state becomes longer.
Fig. 8 shows snapshots of the sample points for the case of uniform jump noise at time t = 5.
For the non-uniform jump noise case, Fig. 9 presents the entropy production, while Fig. 10 shows the corresponding
snapshots at time t = 5.
