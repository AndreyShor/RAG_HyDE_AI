Figure 17S: Time series of the latitude-weighted global average two-meter temperature (T2m) from CAM6 (purple)
and CAMulator (teal). (Top) Seasonal cycle of T2m from 1979 to 2003, showing interannual variations. (Bottom)
Climatological annual cycle of T2m, computed as the multi-year mean, with Â±1 standard deviation shading representing
interannual variability in CAM6 (purple) and CAMulator (teal). The latitude-weighting accounts for the cosine of
latitude to ensure an accurate global mean representation.
