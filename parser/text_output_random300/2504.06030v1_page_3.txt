where V (u) is the potential energy function.
When the right hand side is still a quartic polynomial we call this KLMN integrable.
Inevitably this involves the possibility of magnetic monopole density being non-zero.
(See Ref. [27]). Alternatively the vector product term in the (KLMN) equation could
be a Coriolis type force such as envisaged in Burgers-Zeldovich fluids.
