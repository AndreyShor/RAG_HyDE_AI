Extended Data Fig. 1 | Transport characterizations of flux-grown, high-quality 2H-MoTe2 
crystals. a, Longitudinal resistance Rxx as a function of B at T = 2 K for a monolayer high-
quality 2H-MoTe2 device at a hole doping density p ≈ 1×1013 cm-2. The contact to monolayer 
MoTe2 in this particular device is made by platinum, with the device structure following the 
design reported in Ref. 75. Well resolved Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations can be 
observed when B above approximately 4 T. b, Rxx as a function of B and p at T =2 K for a 
bilayer high-quality 2H-MoTe2 device. The device structure is similar to that used for the 
tMoTe2 devices (Fig. 1a), where the contact to MoTe2 is made using TaSe2. A large electric 
field is applied during the measurements, effectively pushing the holes to one layer. The 
maximum Hall mobility for this particular device is about 5000 cm2/Vs.
