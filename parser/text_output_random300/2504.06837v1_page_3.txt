which will be used throughout. We further note that (1.2) contains the tilt-invariant form of
the reactions derived in [MiS20], where the dual dissipation potential, deﬁned below, will not
depend on ω.
What is more important to us, the system (1.2) has a gradient structure and can now
be investigated with variational methods. More precisely, we will introduce continuous and
discrete gradient systems in continuity equation format (cf. [PeS23]), link them to (1.2) and
appropriate jump processes, respectively, and obtain a convergence result for these gradient
systems in the spirit of Γ-convergence for gradient ﬂows, see [SaS04], more precisely EDP-
convergence in the sense of [MiS20, Ste21, MMP21, Mie23].
Upon rigorously linking these
gradient systems to their corresponding equations, the ﬁnite approximation of solutions will
then be a direct consequence.
Next, we discuss our ﬁnite approximation of the system (1.2). For simplicity, we discretize
the torus using uniform grids Zd
N, N ∈N, noting that our model can be generalized to other
domains and discretizations by following ideas of, e.g., [HrT23]. Furthermore, we assume for
simplicity that the diﬀusion coeﬃcients δi as well as the reaction coeﬃcients κr are spatially
independent, although our analysis would not be harmed when considering suﬃciently smooth
coeﬃcients that are uniformly bounded above and away from zero.
For ﬁxed N ∈N, the discretized evolution equation is a coupled ODE of the concentration
ci,k of each species i ∈I in each discrete position k ∈Zd

[kl/N, (kl+1)/N), l = 1, . . . , d} are d-dimensional cubes of side length 1/N. This system is
related to the reaction-diﬀusion master equation (RDME) treated in [MSW23], where also the
diﬀusion is replaced by jumps between nearest neighbors on the lattice. The intensity of the
jumps is characterized by rates di,k,e := δi√wi,k+ewi,k, which are scaled by N2. In our case,
the reactions are modeled pointwise nonlinearities analogously to the space-continuous system,
whereas in the RDME the reactions are modeled as linear jump processes on the number of
particles. Our systems are complemented with suitable initial data satisfying a suitable well-
preparedness condition speciﬁed later.
This work contains three main analytical results, which we summarize here. We refer to
Section 4 for more details. The ﬁrst main result, Theorem 4.3, is the rigorous link of each
prelimit system (1.3) to a corresponding gradient structure via a so-called energy-dissipation
principle (EDP). Here, the main step is proving a chain rule, which is obtained by exploiting
the discrete nature of the underlying base space.
The second main result, Theorem 4.8, is the energy dissipation principle for the limit system
(1.2).
Since this model is deﬁned over a continuous base space, multiple regularity issues
have to be overcome in order to control in particular the nonlinear reaction terms, which
generate non-convexities in the variational formulation. Introducing the length |γ|1 = P
i∈I γi
of stoichiometric vectors γ ∈[0, ∞)I, our main assumptions are the following:
∀r ∈R :
|αr|1, |βr|1 ≤pcrit := 1+2/d and 1
2|αr+βr|1 < pcrit.
