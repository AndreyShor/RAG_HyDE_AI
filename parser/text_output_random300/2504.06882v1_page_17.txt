Additionally, the boundary of the hexagon T on the kx-ky plane is given by:
∂T = S−
1 + S−
2 + S−
3 .
(S68)
Note that the hexagon is topologically a torus under reciprocal lattice translations. We can identify the segments S±
i
related by the screw rotation and derive the following:
∂(X1 −X2 −T) = −3S−
1 .
(S69)
Thus, we can define ν(3) in the form shown in Eq. (S66). Additionally, there exists a Chern number over the kx-ky
plane.
Tetracosm M7
The momentum space Bieberbach group corresponding to the tetracosm is P41. We assume the action of the point
group C4 = {E, R4, R2
4, R3
4} on momentum space is given by:
R4 : (kx, ky, kz) →

ky, −kx, kz + 1

The reduced K group eK(M7) is isomorphic to Z2 ⊕Z. These invariants can be defined as:
ν(2) = 1
2π

mod 2,
Ch = 1

Z
M
f.
(S71)
Here, the sub-manifolds X, M and the oriented segment S+ are illustrated in Fig. S6(a). The k-space P41 contains
P21 as a subgroup. Therefore, the invariants defined for P21 also hold for P41.
Additionally, the two Z2-invariants ν(2)
1
and ν(2)
2
must be the same due to the additional 4-fold screw rotation
symmetry R4. This explains why there is only one independent Z2-invariant ν(2) in this case.
Hexacosm M8
The momentum space Bieberbach group corresponding to the Hexacosm is P61. We assume the action of the point
group C6 = {E, R6, R2
6, R3
6, R4

The reduced K group eK(M8) is isomorphic to Z. The only invariant is the Chern number, which can be expressed
as:
Ch = 1
2π
Z
M
f.
(S73)
Here, the sub-manifold M is illustrated in Fig. S6(b). Since P31 is a subgroup of P61, both ν(3) and Ch are well
defined in this case. However, the 6-fold screw rotation symmetry requires the Z3-invariant to be trivial. The detailed
proof can be found in the next section.
Didicosm M9
The momentum space Bieberbach group corresponding to the Didicosm is P212121. We assume the action of its
point group D2 = {E, Ry, Rz, RyRz} on momentum space is given by:
Ry : (kx, ky, kz) →
