These features allow quantum classifiers to separate data in a high-dimensional feature space
efficiently.
The key insight is that IQP multi qubit encoding embeds classical data into quantum circuits
via diagonal unitary transformations. This mapping enables quantum feature spaces where clas-
sical algorithms struggle to capture complex correlations. The resulting quantum state exhibits
interference effects that enhance the expressiveness of features for machine learning applications.

Displacement Encoding
Displacement Encoding is used to encode classical data into quantum states using displacement
operators in phase space.
It is particularly relevant when working with continuous-variable
quantum computing (CVQC). It allows for flexible transformations of quantum states, enhancing
the expressiveness of quantum models. The displacement operator is given by: D(α) = eαˆa†−α∗ˆa
where:
α is the displacement amplitude (a complex number).
ˆa† and ˆa are the creation and annihilation operators, respectively. These operators are
used to manipulate quantum states, such as the number (or Fock) states, which describe
the quantum state of a system with a specific number of particles (like photons or quanta)
[41] [42] [43].
The annihilation operator ˆa lowers the number of particles (or quanta) in a quantum state
by 1. For example, if the system is in a state with n quanta (denoted as |n⟩), applying
the annihilation operator a will give: a|n⟩= √n|n −1⟩. It ”removes” one quantum (or
particle) from the state, lowering the state by 1 quantum.
The creation operator ˆa† raises the number of particles (or quanta) in a quantum state by
1. Applying ˆa† to a state |n⟩gives: ˆa†|n⟩= √n + 1|n + 1⟩. It ”adds” one quantum (or
particle) to the state, increasing the state by 1 quantum.
For a two-qubit system, the displacement operator acts as: D(α1, α2) = eα1a†
1−α∗

For an N-qubit system, the displacement encoding is applied to each qubit independently.
The combined displacement operator for the entire N-qubit system is: D(α1, α2, . . . , αN) =
