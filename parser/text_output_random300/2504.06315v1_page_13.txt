Table 8: Scenario C: left ventricle end diastolic volume (EDV) and end systolic volume (ESV).
For the CRA (Tab. 10), as IOP increases, blood flow decreases in a predictable manner, which is consistent with
the vascular resistance caused by elevated pressure. However, the impact is moderate and does not lead to a dramatic
alteration in flow until IOP reaches higher levels (e.g., 30 mmHg). This shows the resilience of the CRA in maintaining
blood flow despite increasing IOP.
More strikingly, the CRV (Tab. 11 shows a pronounced sensitivity to both factors. As IOP rises, the pressure
exerted on the veins increases, and this external pressure can interfere with venous return, especially when the in-
ternal pressure within the veins, driven by cardiovascular dynamics, is lower than the external pressure (IOP). This
phenomenon, known as the Starling effect, can cause venous collapse and reduced blood flow.
For example, at IOP = 25 mmHg, the blood flow in the CRV is noticeably impaired even with baseline LVc.
However, when LVc is reduced by 50%, the CRV blood flow is significantly compromised even at lower IOP levels
(e.g., IOP = 15 mmHg). This drop in blood flow in the CRV under lower IOP conditions suggests that the combination
of reduced LVc and IOP increase could be indicative of certain pathologies, such as Normal Tension Glaucoma (NTG),
where the vascular flow is impaired despite normal values of IOP.
This shift in blood flow dynamics highlights the critical interaction between cardiovascular health and ocular pres-
sure in regulating retinal blood flow. It also points to the potential for these combined factors to serve as biomarkers
for ocular conditions like NTG, where blood supply to the retina may be compromised despite typical IOP values.

Discussions and conclusions
This study introduces the Eye2Heart model, a novel closed-loop framework designed to bridge the gap between
cardiovascular and ocular dynamics. By integrating cardiovascular and retinal models, Eye2Heart provides a com-
prehensive platform for simulating the interconnected functions of these systems. Using a hydraulic-electrical anal-
ogy, the model effectively captures the dynamic interactions, offering a robust tool that can be adapted for multiple
applications, such as studying the impact of cardiovascular diseases on ocular health and understanding how retinal
pathologies are influenced by systemic circulation.
Section 3 presented the validation against clinical and experimental data demonstrating the model’s ability to
replicate key physiological parameters within acceptable ranges. For the cardiovascular system, parameters such as
EDV, ESV, SV, CO, and EF align with clinical values, confirming the model’s capacity to simulate fundamental cardiac
dynamics. Ocular parameters, including CRA and CRV blood flow, also align with experimental data, supporting the
model’s accuracy in retinal hemodynamics.
Additionally, scenario predictions demonstrate the model’s ability to explore the effects of various physiological
changes on both ocular and cardiovascular systems. For instance, simulations reveal how variations in LVc and IOP
influence retinal blood flow and overall cardiovascular function. These predictions highlight the potential of the
