Figure 3.4: The 4FNS charm PDF determined using three different values of the charm mass. The
absolute result (left) is shown at Q = 1.65 GeV, while the ratio to the default value mc = 1.51 GeV (right)
used elsewhere in this paper is shown at Q = 100 GeV.

Figure 3.5: The same as Fig. 3.4 but now for the perturbative charm PDF.
that this is the 4FNS PDF, so it includes both a non-perturbative and a perturbative component.
The latter is strongly dependent on the charm mass, but of course the data correspond to the
unique true value of the mass and the mass dependence of the perturbative component is
present only due to our ignorance of the actual true value. When determining the PDF from the
data, as we do, we expect this spurious dependence to be to some extent reabsorbed into the
fitted PDF. So we expect results to display a moderate dependence on the charm mass.
In Fig. 3.5 the same result is shown, but now for the perturbative charm PDF discussed in
Section 3.1.2, so the charm PDF is of purely perturbative origin and fully determined by the
strongly mass-dependent matching condition. This dependence is clearly seen in the plots.
Furthermore, comparison with Fig. 3.4 shows that indeed this spurious dependence is partly
reabsorbed in the fit when the charm PDF is determined from the data, so that the residual
mass dependence is moderate. In particular, the large-x valence peak, is very stable.
