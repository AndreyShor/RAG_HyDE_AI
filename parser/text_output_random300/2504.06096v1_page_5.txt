are generated with the software described in Refs. [41–46]. The signal Σ+ →pµ+µ−
decay is generated according to a PHSP model and weighted to reproduce the SM dimuon
invariant-mass predicted spectrum [2,3]. Simulated samples are weighted to reproduce
the multiplicity distribution observed in data.
Two sources of background remain after the offline selection: the combinatorial
background, composed from random associations of tracks present in the event; and the
Λ background, consisting of genuine Λ →pπ−decays where the pion is misidentified as
a muon, combined with a third unrelated track identified as a muon. No other kinds of
background contribute, owing mainly to the very small energy of 39.8 MeV available in the
Σ+ →pµ+µ−reaction. Misidentified decays from other hadrons also do not contribute.
Background from four- or more-body final states with unreconstructed particles could
contribute, but would not peak in the mpµ+µ−distribution and thus is included in the
combinatorial background. Finally, background including duplicate tracks from the same
particle hits is rejected offline with a requirement on the minimum angle between each pair
of tracks. Additional details on the background sources are reported in Appendix A.1.
To further reduce the background, a multivariate classifier is devised based on a
Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm [47,48] implemented in the TMVA toolkit [49,50].
This BDT algorithm combines different kinematic and geometric variables. The BDT
is trained using the signal simulated sample and the data sidebands as a proxy for
combinatorial background considering candidates in the mass range mpµ+µ−< 1173 MeV/c2
or 1205 < mpµ+µ−< 1400 MeV/c2. Under the pπ−hypothesis, a veto on the pµ−mass is
applied in both samples around the known Λ mass value [38] (Λ veto) to enforce training
against combinatorial background only. To avoid overtraining, the k-folding technique [51],
with k = 9, is applied. The BDT output ranges from zero, for background-like candidates,
to unity, for signal-like candidates; the corresponding distributions for signal simulation
and data are shown in the Supplemental Material [52]. The data is divided into a sample
with the Λ veto and its complementary sample, consisting mostly of the Λ background,
where the BDT distribution is seen to be very similar for both background sources. The
same BDT classifier is applied to a sample of “same-sign” Σ+ →pµ+µ+ candidates in
data, where a signal would have to violate lepton-number conservation, verifying that fake
structures in the background are not created in either the mpµ+µ−or mµ+µ−distributions.
The final selection is based on the BDT output, the muon and proton particle-
identification variables [53], and the width of the Λ veto window. Criteria on these
variables are optimised on a four-dimensional grid to give the largest significance, defined
as NS/√NS + NB, where NS is the expected signal and NB the expected background yield.
The NS estimate is based on a preliminary fit to data after tight selection criteria are
applied along with the signal efficiency obtained from simulation. The NB estimate is
the sum of two contributions: one obtained from a fit to the mpµ+µ−sidebands for the
combinatorial background; and another to estimate the residual Λ background based
on a fit to the mpπ−distribution without the Λ veto (±10 MeV/c2 around the known Λ
mass [38]).
The mpµ+µ−distribution for candidates satisfying the final selection criteria is shown in
Fig. 1, in which a clear peak at the Σ+ mass is observed with a small residual background.
An extended unbinned maximum-likelihood fit [54] is performed to the selected candidates.
The signal component is described by a Hypatia function [55], with the z parameter fixed
to zero. The remaining parameters are obtained from a fit to the simulated sample and
fixed in the fit to data, while the peak position and resolution parameters are left free to
