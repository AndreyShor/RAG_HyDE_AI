FIG. 2. Illustration for the formulation of topological invari-
ants.
(a) and (b) correspond to Bieberbach groups Pna21
and P31, respectively. Red lines are oriented boundaries of
the 2D submanifolds marked in gray. In (b), the drawing of
Xi with i = 1, 2, 3, namely the three pieces of the surface of
the hexagonal prism, is pushed out for clarity.
Berry phase over ∂c divided by 2π, and therefore ν is
valued in integers. As a different choice of the phases of
the Block wavefunctions may change the Berry phase by
2π, only ν mod n is gauge invariant.
Two examples As observed from Tab. I, the torsion
components exhibit the isomorphic types Z2, Z4 and Z3.
For each Z2, the formulation of the topological invariant
resembles that over the Klein bottle, i.e., one can always
find a 2D sub-manifold with the Klein-bottle topology
under the action of the Bieberbach group.
Hence, we
demonstrate how to formulate Z4 and Z3 topological in-
variants by applying our general method discussed in the
last section.
Two platycosms, second amphidicosm and didicosm,
have Z4 components in their classifications.
Here, we
choose second amphidicosm as an example, since the clas-
sification is just Z4. The corresponding Bieberbach group
is Pna21. Except for the reciprocal translation along the
kz direction, Pna21 has two more generators, namely the
nonsymmorphic symmetries,
Gx : (kx, ky, kz) →(−kx, ky + Gy/2, kz + Gz/2),
Gy : (kx, ky, kz) →(kx + Gx/2, −ky, kz).
(10)
Here, Gi denotes the reciprocal lattice vector along the
ki direction with i = x, y, z. Gx,y are projective represen-
tations of the symmorphic mirror reflections Mx,y in real
space.
To formulate a Z4 topological invariant, we manage to
choose the 2D sub-manifold M as plotted in Fig. 2(a).
M is a sloped rectangular along the diagonal direction
in the ky-kz plane, spans the kx direction and half spans
the diagonal direction in the ky-kx plane, with the kx axis
in the middle. It assumes the periodic boundary condi-
tions along the kx direction as imposed by the reciprocal
translation along the kx direction. The two glide reflec-
tion symmetries Gx,y act nontrivially on the boundary
∂M of M, namely the two kx-edges. The fundamental
domain ∂M/G is a half of an edge with an orientation,
and we may choose it as the oriented segment S+ as in-
dicated in Fig. 2(a). One can trace the orbit of S+ under
the transformation of Gx and Gy to confirm that S+ does
generate the boundary ∂M. Thus, the topological invari-
ant is given by

The Z3 component appears in the topological classifi-
cation for tricosm. The corresponding Bieberbach group
is P31, which is generated by reciprocal translations on
the kx-ky plane and the screw rotation R3. R3 rotates
the momentum-component k⊥on the kx-ky plane by
2π/3 and translates kz by Gz/3, i.e.,
R3 : (k⊥, kz) →(R3k⊥, kz + Gz/3).
(12)
To formulate a Z3 topological invariant, let us con-
sider three cylinders Xi with i = 1, 2, 3 as illustrated
in Fig. 2(b). The boundary ∂Xi consists of two oriented
components S±
i
with i = 1, 2, 3 and the screw rotation
moves S+
i to S+
i+1 with i mod 3, i.e.,
∂Xi = S+

i = S+

In addition, the boundary of the hexagon T on the kx-ky
plane is given by
∂T = S−
1 + S−
2 + S−
3 .
(14)
Note that the hexagon is topologically a torus under the
reciprocal lattice translations.
We can identify S±
i
re-
lated by the screw rotation, and derive that
∂(X1 −X2 −T) = −3S−
1 .

Thus, the Z3 topological invariant is given by

Here, we have dropped T in the integration domain of the

T f is just the Chern

Generalized Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem The critical
phase between any two topological phases over a Bril-
louin platycosms is generically a Weyl semimetal. This
can be attributed to the fact that no crystal symmetries
exist at any point in the Brillouin platycosm, since the ac-
tion of the Bieberbach group on momentum space is free.
Consequently, crossing points of energy bands are gener-
ically twofold degenerate Weyl points.
This has been
thoroughly examined by our constructed lattice models.
Recently, the Nielsen–Ninomiya theorem has been gen-
eralized from the Brillouin torus to the Brillouin first am-
phicosm, i.e., the total chirality number of all Weyl points
over the first amphicosm can be any even integer and is
not necessarily zero as in the case of the torus [21]. In
