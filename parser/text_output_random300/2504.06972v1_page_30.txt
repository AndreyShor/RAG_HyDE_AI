Extended Data Fig. 9 | Temperature dependence of ρxx-νh-D maps at zero magnetic field. 
ρxx as functions of νh and D, measured at B = 0 and T = 15 mK (a), 300 mK (b), 600 mK (c), 
and 900 mK (d). The black regions in a-d are experimentally inaccessible, either due to their 
highly insulating nature or contact issues. These maps clearly demonstrate that the 
superconducting state and RIQAH states possess smaller energy scale than the FQAH states in 
3.83° tMoTe2.
