where f ∈A[a,b] acts on F[a,b](Z) by precomposition on the right and by postcomposition with
f ⊗idZa on the left. Now, for I = [a, b] ⊂[c, d] = J we use the half-braidings of Z to deﬁne an
intertwiner
ηI,J : F[a,b](Z) →F[c,d](Z),
f 7→id ⊗cX[c,a] ◦id ⊗f ⊗id.
We obtain an A-correspondence by taking the inductive limit
(6.3)
F(Z) = lim
−→
a,b
F[a,b](Z).
For an interval I = [a, b], the canonical map into the limit is denoted by ηI : F[a,b](Z) →F(Z).
Lemma 6.5. For any Z ∈Z(C), the A-correspondence F(Z) deﬁned in (6.3) fulﬁlls the locality
condition and thus belongs to DHR(A•).
Proof. The proof follows mutatis mutandis from the argument in [Jon24, Lemma 4.15]. We
spell out some details next.
Let [a, b] be an interval of diameter greater or equal to r. For Y ∈Irr(Ca,b), let {vY
k : Y →
X[a,b]⊗Zb}k be mutually orthogonal partial isometries with P
k vY
k ◦(vY
k )∗equal to the projection
of X[a,b] ⊗Zb onto the Y -isotypical component. In particular,
X
Y ∈Irr(Ca,b)
X
k
vY
k ◦(vY
k )∗= idX[a,b]⊗Zb.
For each Y ∈Irr(Ca,b) there exists a projection pY
a,b : X[a,b] →Y . Deﬁne
wY
k = vY
k ◦pY
a,b : X[a,b] →X[a,b] ⊗Zb.
By construction,
X
Y ∈Irr(Ca,b)
X
k
wY
k ◦(wY
k )∗= idX[a,b]⊗Zb.
In other words, {wY
k }Y,k constitute a projective basis for Fa,b(Z) over End(X[a,b]).
Let I = [a, b] ⊂[c, d] = J. A routine computation shows that the map ηI,J : F[a,b](Z) →
F[c,d](Z) preserves the projective basis, that is, {ηI,J(wY
k )}Y,k is also a projective basis for
F[c,d](Z) over End(X[c,d]):
X
Y ∈Irr(Ca,b),k
ηI,J(wY
k ) ◦ηI,J(wY
k )∗=
X
Y ∈Irr(Ca,b),k
id ⊗cX[c,a] ◦id ⊗wY
k ◦(wY
k )∗⊗id ◦id ⊗c∗
X[c,a]
= id ⊗cX[c,a] ◦idX[a,b]⊗Zb ◦id ⊗c∗
X[c,a] = idX[c,d]⊗Zd
Therefore, in the inductive limit F(Z), we obtain a projective basis over A.
As in the fusion case, one veriﬁes that {ηI(wY
k )}Y,k can be localized in any interval of diameter
at least r. Indeed, consider intervals I = [a, b] and J = [c, d] ⊂(−∞, a). For f ∈AJ we have,
by naturality of the half-braiding and functoriality of ⊗, that
ιJ(f) ⊲ηI(wY
k ) = η[c,b](f ⊗idX[d,b] ◦idX[a,b] ⊗cX[c,a] ◦idX[c,a] ⊗wY
k )
= η[c,b](idX[a,b] ⊗cX[c,a] ◦f ⊗idX[d,a] ⊗wY
k )
= η[c,b](idX[a,b] ⊗cX[c,a] ◦idX[c,a] ⊗wY
k ◦f ⊗idX[d,b]) = ηI(wY
k ) ⊳ιJ(f)
A similar argument shows locality in the case that J = [c, d] ⊂(b, ∞).

We obtain a functor
Z(C) →DHR(A•),
Z 7→F(Z).
