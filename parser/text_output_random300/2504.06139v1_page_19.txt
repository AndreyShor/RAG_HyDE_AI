and gy ∈{2, . . . , dy}.
The box’s behaviour is non-deterministic for gx of
the inputs and deterministic for dx −gx of the inputs on Alice’s side and
analogously for Bob.
We send the reader to their paper for the detailed
description of the box.

Interconversions of Non-local Correlations
This section covers the relations existing between diﬀerent types of general-
ized non-local boxes. Theorems 18 and 19 are from [1].
Theorem 18. The following interconversions are possible:
• 1 d-output box and 1 d′-output box can simulate 1 dd′-output box
• 1 dd′-output box can simulate 1 d-output box
• n d-output boxes can approximate 1 d′-output box
Lemma 1. Using n d-output boxes, Alice and Bob can exactly simulate at
most n d′-output boxes, for d ≥d′.
Lemma 2. Using n d′-output boxes, Alice and Bob can exactly simulate at
most n(1 + log2 d′)/(1 + log2 d) < n d-output boxes for d′ ≤d.
Theorem 19. It is in general impossible, using local reversible operations,
to exactly simulate m d′-output boxes from n d-output boxes.
Theorem 19 follows from lemmas 1 and 2. It implies that there is little
interconvertibility between families of d-output boxes.
The following results by Dupuis et al [13] furthers this lack of interconver-
sions by providing impossibilities of interconversions for d-boxes. This ﬁrst
theorem states that any ﬁnite amount of PR-boxes cannot exactly simulate
a single 3-box.
Theorem 20. It is impossible to simulate a 3-box exactly using a ﬁnite num-
ber of 2-boxes, inﬁnite shared randomness and no communication.
Their next theorem generalizes their ﬁrst one.
Theorem 21. Let S be a ﬁnite set of generalized non-local box with dx =
dy = 2 and arbitrary da and db. Then there exists p such that the p-box
cannot be simulated by a ﬁnite number of boxes taken from the set S.
