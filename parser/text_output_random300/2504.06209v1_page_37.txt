≤: In general, an upper bound on work capacity can be obtained by optimizing each summand of the work capacity
separately:
Cwork = max
agtM ⟨H (At, Mt) −H (St, Mt)⟩t
(G33)
≤

max
agtM [H (At, Mt) −H (St, Mt)]

t
.
(G34)
This upper bound simplifies further for memoryless invariant environments as follows. Note that memoryless
invariant environments admit a description with a |Y| × |Y| transition matrix Φ such that the global process at
any time t is given by
pUt(ut) = pMtAtSt(mt, at, st) = ϕ(st|at)pMtAt(mt, at).
(G35)
Thus, the maximization in eq. (G34) reduces to a maximization over pMtAt. In fact, this is the same optimization
problem for all t since Φ does not depend on t. Thus, the upper bound in eq. (G34) simplifies to
Cwork ≤max
pA0M0
[H (A0M0) −H (S0M0)] .
(G36)
Further, we find
H (A0, M0) −H (S0, M0) = H (A0) + H (M0) −I [A0; M0] −H (S0) −H (M0) + I [S0; M0]
(G37)
where we used H (X, Y ) = H(X) + H(Y ) −I[X; Y ] which is easily checked with an information diagram, see
Supplemental Material A. Using I [X1, Y ] −I [X2, Y ] = I [X1, Y | X2] −I [X2, Y |X1], eq. (G37) becomes
H (A0, M0) −H (S0, M0) = H (A0) −I [A0; M0|S0] −H (S0) + I [S0; M0|A0] .
(G38)
Note that I [S0; M0|A0] = 0 due to d-separation (see Figure 22). Then, by the nonnegativity of conditional

mutual information, we find
H (A0, M0) −H (S0, M0) ≤H (A0) −H (S0)
(G39)
which proves the upper bound.
≥: Consider a memoryless agent model which, for all t, prepares its action in arg maxpA0 [H (A0) −H (S0)], i.e.,
its extracted work is given by max
pA0
[H (S0) −H (A0)]. Since any agent’s extracted work is a lower bound on the
work capacity, this proves the lower bound.
Equations (G31) and (G32) imply equality.
(iii) We start by deriving an expression for the a.m. work production under the assumption that the environment
is modeled by a unifilar product environment channel. The a.m. work production in units of kBT ln 2 is given by
eq. (G12),
W(agtM →
←env) = ⟨H (At|Mt) −H (St|Mt)⟩t .
(G40)
Rewriting the second term in the Ces`aro limit using twice the definition of conditional mutual information eq. (A6)
we find
H (St|Mt) = H (St|MtS0:tA0:t+1) + I [S0:tA0:t+1; St|Mt]
(G41)
= H (St|S0:t) −I [St; MtA0:t+1|S0:t] + I [S0:tA0:t+1; St|Mt] .
