The darker and lighter shaded areas correspond to 68% and 95% confidence level intervals,
respectively, accounting only for statistical uncertainties. The values of the squared transversity
amplitudes for J/ψ and ψ(2S)→µ+µ−decays from Refs. [43] and [44] are indicated by the
markers, where the uncertainties on the B0
s →J/ψϕ measurement are too small to be visible.
the misidentified background. Uncertainties are also considered on the data-simulation
corrections applied to the simulated samples. The resulting uncertainty is small, and
removing the corrections entirely in the pseudoexperiment generation has only a limited
impact on the resulting values of the observables. The angular efficiency is derived from
simulated samples using reconstructed particles whose trajectories are well matched to
particles in the signal decay. Relaxing the association requirements, in the efficiency
model used in the pseudoexperiment generation, also has only a limited impact on the
observables.
For the signal and background modelling, uncertainties are assigned based on the
assumptions that the signal and different background components factorise in mass and
angular distributions. To test the assumption on the signal factorisation, signal decays
are sampled from the SM simulation and introduced in place of the signal component
in the pseudoexperiment generation. A similar approach is used for the semileptonic
backgrounds. For the remaining backgrounds, a moment analysis, similar to that used
to derive the angular efficiency coefficients, is used to obtain models that take into
account correlations. Due to the limited dataset size, the factorisation assumptions on
the combinatorial and misidentified backgrounds are the largest sources of systematic
uncertainty in the analysis, but are nonetheless well below the statistical uncertainties. An
uncertainty is also assigned on the signal mass modelling by considering modifications to
the tails of the signal mass model. Alternate models for the semileptonic background are
considered based on kernel-density estimates and, for the angular variables, polynomial
models. Other alternate models are derived by varying the form factors used in generation
of the semileptonic samples. For the combinatorial background in the high-q2 region, an
alternate mass model is trialled based on a power-law turn-on and fall-off behaviour.
