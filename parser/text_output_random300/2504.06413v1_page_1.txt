ABSTRACT
Quantum computing leverages the unique properties of qubits and
quantum parallelism to solve problems intractable for classical
systems, offering unparalleled computational potential. However,
the optimization of quantum circuits remains critical, especially
for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices with limited
qubits and high error rates. Genetic algorithms (GAs) provide a
promising approach for efficient quantum circuit synthesis by au-
tomating optimization tasks. This work examines the impact of
various mutation strategies within a GA framework for quantum
circuit synthesis. By analyzing how different mutations transform
circuits, it identifies strategies that enhance efficiency and perfor-
mance. Experiments utilized a fitness function emphasizing fidelity,
while accounting for circuit depth and T operations, to optimize
circuits with four to six qubits. Comprehensive hyperparameter
testing revealed that combining delete and swap strategies out-
performed other approaches, demonstrating their effectiveness in
developing robust GA-based quantum circuit optimizers.

INTRODUCTION
Quantum computing offers a promising way to tackle complex
problems that classical computers cannot solve [8, 9, 25]. Quantum
circuits lie at the core of quantum computing and are essential
for implementing quantum algorithms [3]. The efficient synthe-
sis and optimization of these circuits is critical yet challenging,
especially on NISQ devices, which have limited qubits and high
error rates [17, 19]. As more performant quantum hardware contin-
ues to emerge, efficient and automated quantum circuit synthesis
grows increasingly important, because manual circuit creation is
not sustainable [1, 2, 30].
The synthesis of quantum circuits is difficult because of the com-
plexity of quantum operations and the limits of current hardware.
GAs offer a possible solution by using evolutionary strategies to
improve quantum circuit designs [24]. GAs are especially effective
at exploring large, complex solution spaces [4, 13], but their per-
formance in quantum circuit synthesis and optimization remains
an open area of research [15, 21]. In particular, examining how
different mutation strategies interact with quantum circuits may
provide new ways to enhance optimization efficiency.
To investigate these mutation strategies, we conducted a series
of experiments. We developed a multifunctional quantum environ-
ment that can create, manipulate, and evaluate quantum circuits
efficiently. It includes a circuit optimizer that works within the
Clifford + T set, following standard protocols [23], and an unbiased
circuit generator that produces diverse candidate circuits for test-
ing. An autonomous system switches between serial and parallel
processing modes based on available hardware and data, ensuring
optimal resource use.
A GA framework was then implemented within this quantum
environment. The fitness function in this framework is derived
from fidelity, circuit depth, and the number of T operations [12, 26,
31]. The framework allows either a single-population or an island
model, along with tournament selection for elites and offsprings,
