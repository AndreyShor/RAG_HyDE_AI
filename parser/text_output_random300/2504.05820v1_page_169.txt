NNLO polarized PDFs with MHOU

made of the gluon PDF ∆g and of five independent quark flavor PDF combinations: the singlet
∆Σ, the non-singlet sea ∆Ti, and the non-singlet valence ∆V, ∆V3. These PDF combinations
are defined as in Eq. (1.61). The parametrization scale is Q2
0 = 1.0 GeV2; PDFs are then evolved
to the scale of the physical processes by means of DGLAP equations, see Section 5.1. Because
the available piece of experimental information is sensitive to an asymmetry between ∆s and
∆¯s only very mildly, we assume ∆s(x, Q2
0) = ∆¯s(x, Q2
0). Differences between ∆s and ∆¯s may
occur for Q2 > Q2
0 at NNLO and beyond, because higher-order QCD corrections make the two
distributions evolve differently. This effect is however very small. Finally, we assume that charm
is completely generated from gluon splitting through parton evolution, therefore we set to zero,
and do not parametrize, a possible intrinsic charm component at the parametrization scale Q2
0.
Concerning the parametrization form, we choose a feed-forward neural network with six output
nodes, each of which corresponds to an element of the basis defined in Eq. (5.2). The neural
network architecture and activation function are determined according to the hyperparameter
optimization procedure delineated in Section 5.2.3. The output of the neural network is then
related to the polarized PDFs as
x∆f(x, Q2
0, θ) = A∆fx1−α∆f (1 −x)β∆f NN∆f(x, θ) ,
(5.3)
where ∆f denotes each element of the chosen basis, A∆f is a normalization factor, α∆f and
β∆f are preprocessing exponents, and NN∆f(x, θ) is the output of the neural network, which
depends on weights and biases, collectively denoted as θ.
The normalization factor A∆f is equal to one for all PDFs but the non-singlet triplet and octet
PDF combinations, ∆T3 and ∆T8, for which we define
A∆T3 = a3

(5.4)
here a3 and a8 are the baryon octet decay (scale-independent) constants whose experimental
values are [365]
a3 = 1.2756 ± 0.0013
and
a8 = 0.585 ± 0.025 .
(5.5)
The integrals in Eq. (5.4) are computed each time the parameters θ change, assuming xmin =
10−4. For each replica, the values of a3 and a8 are random numbers sampled from a Gaussian
distribution with mean value and standard deviation equal to the corresponding experimental
central value and uncertainty, Eq. (5.5). Enforcing Eq. (5.4) therefore corresponds to requiring
that SU(2) and SU(3) flavor symmetries are exact up to the experimental uncertainties quoted
in Eq. (5.5).
Finally, the preprocessing exponents α∆f and β∆f, which are needed to speed up optimization,
are determined by means of an iterative procedure, firstly introduced in [38]. Specifically,
