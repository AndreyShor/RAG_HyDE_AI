Abstract 
Organic-inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) are promising optoelectronic materials, but their 
instability under radiation environments restricts their durability and practical applications. Here 
we employ electron and synchrotron X-ray beams, individually, to investigate the radiation-
induced instability of two types of OIHP single crystals (FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3). Under the 
electron beam, we observe that 3-point star-style cracks grow on the surface of FAPbBr3, and 
bricklayer-style cracks are formed on the surface of MAPbBr3. Under the X-ray beam, a new 
composition without organic components appears in both FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3. Such cracking 
and composition changes are attributed to the volatilization of organic components. We propose a 
volume-strain-based mechanism, in which the energy conversion results from the organic cation 
loss. Using nanoindentation, we reveal that beam radiations reduce the Youngâ€™s modulus and 
increase the hardness of both OIHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the structural and 
mechanical stabilities of OIHP single crystals in radiation environments.
