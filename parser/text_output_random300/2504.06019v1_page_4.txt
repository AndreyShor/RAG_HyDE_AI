The model has idealised microphysics, with saturated water vapor (q > qs) being
removed at the condensational timescale τ. There is no liquid water or ice phase
included in this formulation. Radiation is also idealised as a constant cooling rate, r,
which provides a first-order approximation of the radiative cooling in the atmosphere
(Jeevanjee and Fueglistaler 2020; Agasthya et al. 2025). The buoyancy equation
differs from dry Rayleigh-B´enard convection in the inclusion of a condensation term,
C ≡γ(q −qs)H(q −qs)/τ (Vallis et al. 2019), and has been extended here for climate
study with a bulk radiative cooling term, gr/θ0. Note condensation also provides a
sink in moisture (equation (3)). The relationship of the perturbation temperature
(δT = T −T0, where T0 = 300K) to the buoyancy is given by equation (4), and
can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics (Vallis et al. 2019). Equation
(5) is the Clausius-Clapeyron relation (5), linearised about T0. The simplicity of
the radiative cooling and microphysics makes a detailed fundamental analysis of the
model possible.

Idealised Climate Change - Boundary Conditions
An idealised climate change scenario can be set up by careful choice of the boundary
conditions. We take the surface boundary conditions to be
b(0) = g∆Tsurf/θ0,
q(0) = RHsurf qs(0) = RHsurf q0eα∆Tsurf,
u(0) = 0.
(7)
We impose a surface temperature of T(0) = T0 + ∆Tsurf, and a surface relative
humidity, where the relative humidity is defined as RH ≡q/qs. We use equation (4)
to define b(0), and equation (5) to define q(0). We also use idealised no-slip boundary
conditions, at both boundaries (as in Vallis et al. (2019)).
The top of the domain represents the tropopause. We use moist pseudoadiabatic
boundary conditions at the top boundary, which can be expressed as,
dm
dz (H) = db
dz (H) + γ dq
dz (H) = 0,
q(H) = qs(H),
u(H) = 0.
