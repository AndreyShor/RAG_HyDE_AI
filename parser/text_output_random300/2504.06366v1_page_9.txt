3.3 Regional Responses 
The evolution of OHUE can be decomposed into different latitude bands to find their 
contributions to global change. For example, the latitudinal components of OHUE can be 
expressed as:  
 (3) 
In this equation, AG and ∆TG represent the global surface area and the GMST anomaly, 
respectively. ∆N(x,y) is the regional heat uptake rate. The global sum of OHUElat equals the global 
OHUE, as discussed previously. Here, we focus on the regional contributions of ocean heat uptake 
to the changes in global OHUE.  
 
 
Figure 3. OHUE as a function of time and latitude from models and observations. The y-axis shows the 
centered year of the 20-year window. The unit is Wm⁻² K⁻¹ per 1˚ latitude band. Top two rows are OHUE 
from the ensemble-mean of individual models and the multi-model mean (MMM). The bottom row shows 
the results from IAP, Ishii datasets, and Green’s Function (GF) method. The regional OHUE based on GF 
is obtained by using excess temperature without effect of ocean circulation change.  
 
The mid-latitudes play a leading role in contributing to the time-mean global OHUE, with 
consistency shown across models and datasets (Figure 3). For instance, two strong bands of
