Figure S2. Characterization of the MoSe2/hBN/WS2 device. (a) Photoluminescence 
(PL) spectrum from the device with 532 nm excitation. (b) Raman spectra from region 
of WS2, MoSe2 and heterostructure. (c) The optical microscopy image of the device, 
with the scale bar of 10 Î¼m. (d) The reflectance contrast mapping with the size range 
the same as (c). The color bar represents the magnitude of the reflectance contrast of 
the AW resonance. The dotted line marks the outline of WS2. (e-j) The atomic force 
microscope measurements of top hBN (e,h), bottom hBN (f,i) and inset hBN (g,j). The 
spectrum measurements (a,b,d) are performed at cryogenic temperature.
