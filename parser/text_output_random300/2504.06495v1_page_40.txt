However, the conclusion in the last sentence ignores an important point: the measurement
step (B) itself reduces the value of X0, particularly when δk is small. To address this, the
following theorem considers the full measurement setup involving steps (A), (B), and (C), and
explicitly accounts for the possibility that δk may be very small. Mathematically, we capture
this by allowing δk →0 as τ →∞. To be clear, we are not suggesting that δk physically
varies with time; rather, this formulation enables us to analyze asymptotic regimes in which
both τ is large and δk is small.
Theorem 6 Consider the setup as described in (A), (B), and (C), and ﬁx a measurement
outcome k ∈{1, . . . , K}. Suppose that either δk is ﬁxed as τ →∞, or that δk →0 while
τ · δk →∞as τ →∞. Then the conditional median of the post-measurement state satisﬁes
Med(X0 | Xτ ̸= −∞, B = k) = log(ǫ) + log(2) + log (τ · δk) + R(τ),
where the remainder term satisﬁes lim
τ→∞R(τ) = 0.
The proof is provided in the appendix. Theorem 6 shows that the conditional median of X0
increases with τ, with the leading-order behavior captured by log (τ · δk). Conceptually, the
result follows from equation (29), once we account for the additional shift of log(δk) in the
initial condition X0 induced by the measurement step (B) — though the formal proof is a
bit more involved.
In Theorems 1 and 2, we treated xa/b = log(φa/b) as ﬁxed while taking the limit ǫ →0, i.e.,
log ǫ →−∞. However, the relevant quantity for the results is not the absolute magnitude
of xa/b or log ǫ individually, but rather their diﬀerence: xa/b −log ǫ. Theorem 6 shows that,
conditional on survival until time τ, the initial diﬀerence X0 −log ǫ = log(Φ0/ξ0) typically
scales as log(τ · δk) at τ = 0. Thus, if we hold X0 = xa/b ﬁxed, Theorem 6 implies that ǫ
typically scales as 1/(τ · δk). This scaling justiﬁes the limit conditions ǫ →0 and ǫ · t →∞
used in Theorems 1 and 2, provided that 1 ≫δk ≫1/τ.
