Figure 33. The Poincaré plot of the pN system at η = 0.21. Qualitatively similar to the N system
in terms of symmetry, its chaotic regions are larger, and the pretzel region is on the threshold of
KAM breakdown.
Somewhat remarkably, the highly nonlinear R system, shown for two different values
of η in Figure 32, retains all of the qualitative features of the N system, at least over the
range of η numerically accessible. The annulus, pretzel, and chaotic regions all retain their
same basic structure, though asymmetrically deformed. This deformation increases as η
increases and occurs because the Hamiltonian given by Equation (152) is invariant under
the discrete symmetry (pi, ϵ) →(−pi, −ϵ) instead of the pi →−pi symmetry in the N
system. The discrete constant ϵ = ±1 is a measure of the ﬂow of time of the gravitational
ﬁeld relative to the particle momenta. In Figure 32, ϵ = +1, the opposite choice would
create the same distortion but towards the lower left. The situation is reminiscent of the
two-body case of the previous section, where the gravitational coupling to the kinetic-
energy causes a distortion of the trajectory from an otherwise symmetric pattern. Whether
or not KAM breakdown occurs for higher η values remains an interesting open question.
As compared to the N and R plots the pN system, shown in Figure 33, is notably
different. It retains the pi →−pi symmetry of the N system but appears to undergo a
KAM transition at η ∼0.3, as shown in Figure 34. For small η, the distinction with the N
system is mild, but for η = 0.21, the lines across the bottom of the ﬁgure slightly widen.
Larger regions of chaos become evident around the edges of the groups of ellipses in the
lower regions of the ﬁgure for η = 0.26. Further increasing η →0.3, the lower part of
the Poincaré section becomes engulfed by a chaotic sea; only a few non-connected islands
of regular motion remain. No such behavior is seen in R system for similar values of η.
These distinctions are not artifacts due to differences in scalings between the systems. The
underlying feature that enforces the structure on the phase space in the R system but not in
the pN system remains to be understood.
