Observations have shown that blazar’s flux variations
are stochastic, nonlinear, and aperiodic in nature and
well characterized by the simplest model of Continuous
Autoregressive Moving Average [CARMA(p,q)] (B. C.
Kelly et al. 2009), also known as red noise model, but a
small percentage of sources in the entire blazar popula-
tion exhibit regular variations in the light curves, such
particular phenomenon is known as quasi-periodic oscil-
lation (QPO), which appear to be rare in AGNs. Such
kinds of regular variations have been observed across the
entire EM spectrum with the diverse timescales, ranging
from minutes through months to years (C. Urry et al.
1993; S. Wagner & A. Witzel 1995; D. Petry et al. 2000;
K. Katarzy´nski et al. 2001; J. Aleksi´c et al. 2011; A. San-
drinelli et al. 2014; M. Carnerero et al. 2017; A. Sarkar
et al. 2019; C. M. Raiteri et al. 2021a; M. A. Sobolewska
et al. 2014; A. C. Gupta et al. 2008b, 2019b; L. Mao
& X. Zhang 2024). The observed diverse timescale of
QPOs may be associated with different underlying phys-
ical mechanisms and radiation processes in blazars. In-
traday variability with timescales ranging from minutes
to several hours may be originated via rotating inhomo-
geneous helical jet or current-driven kink instabilities
(C. M. Raiteri et al. 2021b,a; S. G. Jorstad et al. 2022).
A short-term variability with a timescale ranging from
days to a few months is believed to originate from the
helical motion of magnetized plasma blob within the jet
or perturbation in accretion disk at the innermost stable
circular orbit (J. Zhou et al. 2018; A. C. Gupta et al.
2019b; A. Sarkar et al. 2021; A. Roy et al. 2022a; A.
Banerjee et al. 2023; R. Prince et al. 2023; A. Sharma
et al. 2024a; J. Tantry et al. 2025). A long-term variabil-
ity of timescale from several months to years may be as-
sociated with supermassive binary black hole (SMBBHs;
M. C. Begelman et al. (1980)) systems or jet structures.
This interpretation has been adopted in several stud-
ies, e.g.(M. J. Graham et al. 2015; A. Sandrinelli et al.
2016; A. C. Gupta 2017; P.-F. Zhang et al. 2017; X.-
P. Li et al. 2021; G.-W. Ren et al. 2021b,a; Y. Haiyan
et al. 2023; X.-P. Li et al. 2023). The two most promis-
ing candidates, PG 1553+113 and OJ 287, have been
reported for hosting an SMBBH system (A. Sillanpaa
et al. 1988; M. Valtonen et al. 2011; M. Ackermann et al.
2015; M. Tavani et al. 2018; S. Adhikari et al. 2024).
The γ-ray emission in blazars originates from their rel-
ativistic jets. Investigating quasi-periodic variations in
γ-ray emissions not only deepens our understanding of
jet physics but also provides insights into particle accel-
eration mechanisms and jet dynamics. This has become
possible due to the continuous monitoring capability of
Fermi’s Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). Leverag-
ing long-term observations from Fermi-LAT, numerous
strong QPOs in the γ-ray band have been reported in
the literature. Additionally, in recent decades, system-
atic searches have been performed for QPOs in different
wavebands for a number of sources (M. Gierli´nski et al.
2008; A. C. Gupta et al. 2008b,a; P. Lachowicz et al.
2009; O. King et al. 2013; W. Alston et al. 2015; G.
Bhatta et al. 2016; H.-W. Pan et al. 2016; G. Bhatta
& N. Dhital 2020; P. Pe˜nil et al. 2020; G. Bhatta 2021;
G.-W. Ren et al. 2021b; S. Yang et al. 2021; G. Wang
et al. 2022; Y. Gong et al. 2022a, 2023; J. Otero-Santos
et al. 2023; L. Lu et al. 2024; C. Ren et al. 2024). In
recent years, some QPO studies with high statistical sig-
nificance have been reported in different EM bands. For
instance, A. Tripathi et al. (2021) reported in radio, A.
Roy et al. (2022b) in optical, E. Smith et al. (2023), and
A. C. Gupta et al. (2019a) in γ-ray.
Additionally, some reported QPOs have also been in-
terpreted by other geometrical models, such as pulsat-
ing accretion flow instability, jet precession, and Lense-
Thirring precession of accretion disks (G. E. Romero
et al. 2000; F. M. Rieger 2005; L. Stella & M. Vietri
1997). Apart from the long-term persistent QPOs, sev-
eral transient QPOs have also been reported (J. Zhou
et al. 2018; F. A. Benkhali et al. 2020; P. Pe˜nil et al.
2020; A. K. Das et al. 2023; R. Prince et al. 2023; H. X.
Ren et al. 2023; A. Sharma et al. 2024a). The physi-
cal mechanisms of transient QPOs have been attributed
to the orbiting hotspots on the disks, or close to the
innermost stable circular orbits, magnetic reconnection
within the jet, and helical orbital motion of blobs in the
jet under the influence of magnetic field (X. Zhang & G.
Bao 1990; A. V. Mangalam & P. J. Wiita 1993; A. C.
Gupta et al. 2008b,a, 2019a; C.-Y. Huang et al. 2013; P.
Mohan & A. Mangalam 2015). Thus, QPO studies play
a crucial role in understanding the origin of such vari-
ations, the underlying radiation mechanisms, and the
physical properties of SMBH systems.
The mass of a black hole is one of the most funda-
mental parameters as it plays a key role in shaping its
emission properties and evolutionary behavior. In liter-
ature, several methods have been proposed to estimate
the black hole mass: (1) the reverberation mapping tech-
nique (S. Kaspi et al. 2000), (2) single-epoch spectral
measurements/broad line width technique (M. Vester-
gaard 2002), (3) the gas and stellar dynamics technique
(R. Genzel et al. 1997), and (4) the variability timescale
technique (J. Fan et al. 1999; K. Cheng et al. 1999; J.-H.
Fan 2005; J.-H. Fan et al. 2009; J. Yang & J. Fan 2010;
H. Liu & J. Bai 2015) and reference therein. Z. Pei et al.
(2022) derived the black hole mass of the blazar ON 246
to be ∼8.08 × 107 M⊙based on certain assumptions,
