Lemma 5.3. Given any r-qubit unitary operators U1, . . . , Uk for some k < 2r−1 and any bit
b ∈{0, 1}, there is an r-qubit state |ψb⟩with pure parity b such that ⟨1r| Ui |ψb⟩= 0 for all 1 ≤i ≤k.
Proof. Let P0 and P1 be as in Deﬁnition 5.1. For 1 ≤i ≤k, let Zi ⊆Hr be the (2r −1)-dimensional
subspace of Hr spanned by {U ∗
i |x⟩: x ∈{0, 1}r \ {1r}}. Then for all i, ⟨1r| Ui |ψ⟩= 0 for any state
|ψ⟩∈Zi. Letting Z := Tk
i=1 Zi, we see that dim(Z) ≥2r −k. For b ∈{0, 1}, we then have
dim(Pb ∩Z) = dim Pb + dim Z −dim(Pb + Z) ≥dim Pb + dim Z −2r ≥2r−1 + (2r −k) −2r ≥1 .
It follows that we can choose a state (unit vector) |ψb⟩in Pb ∩Z, and this vector has the desired
properties.
We will use Lemma 5.3 to turn oﬀCZ-gates. If some CZ-gate G that touches all r qubits
(and possibly other qubits) is applied to Ui |ψb⟩⊗· · · , then G is turned oﬀ, i.e., G(Ui |ψb⟩⊗· · · ) =
Ui |ψb⟩⊗· · · , where “· · · ” represents some state of the other qubits, if they are present.

Quantum Circuit Lower Bounds
In this section we prove that no depth-2 QAC-circuit computes ⊕n for n > 3 (see Deﬁnition 2.7),
which improves upon a previous version of our paper [PFGT20].
Theorem 6.1. No depth-2 QAC-circuit computes ⊕n for n > 3.
This result is tight in the sense that there is a simple 4-qubit depth-2 QAC-circuit that com-
putes ⊕3:
|t⟩

We will prove Theorem 6.1 through a sequence of lemmas that may be useful in proving lower
bounds for circuits of higher depth. We will also make repeated use of the Entanglement Lemma
(Lemma 4.3) and Lemma 5.3. We adopt the conventions of Deﬁnition 2.5 to describe gates within
circuits.
Lemma 6.2. There is no depth-1 QAC-circuit that weakly computes ⊕n for n ≥2.
Proof. Consider such a circuit C on n ≥2 input qubits, witnessed by some ﬁxed initial state of
the ancilla qubits.
The target and ﬁrst two input qubits must all be incident to a single gate
G(1)
0
= CSZ for some S ⊇{0, 1, 2}, for otherwise there is an input qubit that does not interact with
the target qubit at all, whence C cannot weakly compute ⊕n. Then by Lemma 5.3 (with r := 2
and U1 := G(1)
{1,2}), for each b ∈{0, 1}, qubits 1 and 2 can be initially committed to a 2-qubit state
with pure parity b that turns oﬀG(1)
0 . With either of these initial states (setting any other input
qubits to |0⟩), the target does not interact with any other qubits and so can only be G(1.5)
0
G(0.5)
0
|0⟩.
But then the ﬁnal state of the target does not depend on b, and thus C does not weakly compute
⊕n.
