Extend Data Fig.3 | Schematic illustration of GMOC’s integration on cross-sphere climate signals in 
multiscale processes. a, Basic atmospheric mean meridional circulation (AMMC) consisting of Hadley, Ferrel and 
Polar cells. b, The configuration of processes at the air-sea interface include [36]: westerly jet at the Antarctic 
Circumpolar Current (ACC) region, buoyancy gain and loss induced by Ekman effects, northern subpolar jet, 
upward heat flux and buoyancy loss, and air‒sea interactions associated with easterlies in the tropics. The 
configuration of ocean interior processes include: Northen Hemisphere (NH) sinking to form the North Atlantic 
Deep Water (NADW), diffusive mixing in tropical oceans, Southern Hemisphere (SH) wind-driven Ekman transport, 
eddy-induced circulation, and wind-driven upwelling and eddy-induced circulation associated with the Antarctic 
Bottom Water (AABW). c, The mechanism summarized from b for GMOC based on the three-term balance model, 
i.e., the residual between the difference of NH sinking and SH upwelling subtracting tropical upwelling drives the 
change in pycnocline depth anomaly [2,37].
