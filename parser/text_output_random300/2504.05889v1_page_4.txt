predominantly composed of iodine (I) states, whereas the
conduction band is mainly derived from the empty states
of lead (Pb). The MA+ cation contributes negligibly near
the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band
minimum (CBM). In SbH4PbI3, the DOS exhibits simi-
lar features; however, the SbH+
4 cation appears to have
a greater influence on the conduction band at higher en-
ergy levels, even though its states lie below the VBM
and above the CBM. A significant difference between the
two materials is observed in the relative positioning of
the band edges. In SbH4PbI3, the VBM and CBM are
shifted upward by approximately 0.75 eV and 0.56 eV,
respectively, compared to MAPbI3. This upward shift
should also be compatible with the electron transport
layers (ETLs) in perovskite solar cells. The ETL layer
is important for the overall efficiency in perovskite solar

Figure 3 shows the calculated band structures of the
two materials. Electronic transitions across the band gap
are direct in both cases.
The calculated band gap of
MAPbI3 is 1.56 eV, which agrees well with experimen-
tally observed values between 1.55 eV and 1.60 eV1,2.
Underestimation of band gaps by standard DFT calcula-
tions is to be expected, but addition of relativistic effects
due to the heavy Pb ion is likely to be the cause of this
good agreement. Substitution of the MA+ cation with
SbH+
4 causes band gap reduction. The calculated band
gap of SbH4PbI3 is 1.37 eV, roughly 0.2 eV lower than
the band gap of MAPbI3. The calculated band gap is in
good agreement with the 1.4 eV value obtained with GW
calculations in previous theoretical works5. Since the ab-
sorber with perfect direct band gap near 1.4 eV in solar
cells would be ideal for high-efficiency photovoltaics, such
a fact means SbH4PbI3 is highly qualified for the photo-
voltaic application need of high efficiency.
