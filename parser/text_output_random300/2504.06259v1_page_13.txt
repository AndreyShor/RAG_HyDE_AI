FIG. 12: Alignment of individual addressing beams and
calibration of individual and counter-propagating RF
drive amplitude for qubits q0 (blue) and q1 (red). a)
The ion position is swept across the individual
addressing beams by tuning the axial trap potential.
The x-axis represents line numbers of the solution which
are nominally 1 µm apart. b) and c) Scan of the DDS
RF drive amplitude for a single tone on the IA beam for

single-qubit gates. Solid lines are fits to the data.
such that each ion is measuring a mode with which it
has a relatively strong coupling. The data is then fit to a
parameterized Gaussian function to find sideband center
frequencies. The calibrated frequencies are then used for
both sideband cooling and MS gate calibrations.
Two-qubit MS gates are implemented by applying the
global beam in combination with tones on the IA beams’
AOM that drive transitions near the radial red and blue
motional sidebands of the participating modes. A first
indication of entanglement can be realized with a sym-
metric detuning scan that steps the red and blue tones
such that they move symmetrically outward from the car-

FIG. 13: Calibration of radial motional sidebands using
qubits q0 and q1. a) Rough calibration using peak
maxima. Vertical lines indicate the measured sideband
center frequencies. b) and c) Fine scan of lower (b) and
upper (c) sidebands centered on peaks found in a). The
lower (upper) manifold sidebands are calibrated in

rier transition with increasing detuning. A crossing of
the zero and two bright populations with one bright sup-
pressed indicates a detuning that results in entanglement.
Figure 14a shows a symmetric detuning sweep between
two motional modes. The crossings of zero bright and
two bright populations near -15 and +40 kHz are pos-
sible choices for the MS gate detuning. As described in
Section II, the radial modes used for entangling gates are
chosen to give the largest coupling strength (Lamb-Dicke
factor) for a particular ion pair and sideband detunings
are chosen such that contributions from both modes add
constructively. In this case, the region around 40 kHz is
the region where contributions from both modes add con-
structively. In practice, we rarely do this calibration, as
we have already measured the sideband frequencies and
for given chain lengths already have selected the desired
detuning to realize a frequency robust gate. However, it
is an instructive measure for understanding the dynamics
of the MS gate. Instead, we typically utilize the method
described below.
Since we’ve preselected the detuning to maximize cou-
pling and frequency robustness, we now match the am-
