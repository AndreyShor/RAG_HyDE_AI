Figure 1. Feynman rules for color graphs
In some sense, we consider color factors as objects in a combinatorial differential geometry with Euclidean
metric.
The matrices T i are chosen orthogonal and normalized,
(3)
Tr T iT j = δi,j.
We use orthogonality to express the structure constants fijk in terms of the matrices T i,
(4)
fijk = Tr [T i, T j]T k.
The cyclicity of the trace implies that the fijk are fully anti-symmetric in their indices,
(5)
fijk = fjki = fkij = −fikj = −fkji = −fjik.
The first two identities of (5) allow us to use a graphical representation.
To T i
ab we associate a corolla (a vertex with three half-edges). The half-edge i has no orientation, while
the half-edges a and b are ingoing and outgoing, respectively (see Figure 1).
To fijk we associate a corolla of three non-oriented half-edges, where we fix a planar representation
with counter-clockwise i, j, k. The sum over double indices glues the corresponding half-edges. Note that
matrix products in the T i preserve the orientation. We obtain a graph with fixed planar embedding: a
ribbon graph. By anti-symmetry, flipping two edges in the vertex fijk gives a minus sign, see Figure 2.
So, the planar embedding determines the sign of the color factor.

Figure 2. Flipping two edges at an adjoint vertex gives a minus sign.
The graphical representations of (1) to (5) are in Figure 3, where we swapped the sides of (1). To sim-
plify the graphical notation it is customary to drop the labels of external half-edges using the convention
that half-edges located at the same position have equal labels.

where (Eab)cd = δa,cδb,d are the elementary matrices. We fix any sequence of αβ in T αβ and ˜T αβ to
continue the labels 1, . . . , N −1 of T k to N −1 + 2N(N −1)/2 = N 2 −1.
Proof. The orhonormality of T αβ and ˜T αβ is clear. Because for α ̸= β and any γ we have (no sum)
Tr EγγEαβ = δα,γTr Eαβ = 0, the T αβ and ˜T αβ are orthogonal to the T k. From
