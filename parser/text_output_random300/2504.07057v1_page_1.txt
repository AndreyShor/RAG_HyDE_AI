Abstract
Human-induced changes in atmospheric aerosols have introduced a climate forc-
ing by modifying cloud droplet number concentration, liquid water, and cloud
fraction [1, 2]. This forcing is subject to large uncertainties as cloud adjustments
have not only complex dependence on background conditions [3, 4], but also
temporal fluctuations, especially those driven by diel variations in solar heating
[5]. However, direct observations of such diel changes are still limited. Here, we
present observational evidence of substantial diel changes in the cloud adjust-
ments to aerosols within ship-tracks—linear lines of polluted clouds captured in
satellite images. We developed a novel method to automatically determine the
age of each ship-track segment and analyze cloud adjustments to aerosols. We
show that more aged polluted clouds with extended nighttime exposure exhibit
higher increases in cloud fraction. By contrast, liquid water path adjustments fol-
low a non-monotonic pattern: they generally decrease with time before reversing
trend in clouds formed at nighttime. Most of these diel contrasts are statistically
significant and likely stem from differences in solar heating and cloud precipita-
tion. The increase in cloud fraction adjustment suggests a larger aerosol effective
radiative forcing, −0.1 ∼−0.4W m−2, than the estimate without considering
temporal variations, while the temporal changes in liquid water path adjustments
