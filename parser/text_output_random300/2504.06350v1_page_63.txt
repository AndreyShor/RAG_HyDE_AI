An investigation into the performance of the protocol under ideal reconciliation conditions (ϵ = 1)
reveals the potential for achieving remarkably high secret key rates, approaching one bit per use. Notable,
symmetric configurations, where the transmissivities are the same between Alice-Charlie and Bob-Charlie,
are not the most secure option, particularly for longer distances. The optimal configuration is asymmetric,
corresponding to minimal loss in Alice’s link, which allows Bob’s link to have a low transmissivity.
Specifically, if Charlie’s position can be situated close to Bob, the total transmission distance, i.e., the
distance between Alice and Bob, can theoretically extend up to 80 km. Taking into account realistic
reconciliation performance, the experimental rates closely approach the maximum theoretical predictions.
In particular, with ϵ ≈0.97, the experimental rates can achieve remarkably high values over typical
connection lengths within a metropolitan network.
Zhang et al. [365] introduced a CV-MDI QKD protocol using squeezed states and demonstrated that
its secret key rate consistently surpasses the coherent-state-based protocol, particularly under collective
attacks, with a total maximum transmission distance increase of 6.1 km under both perfect and imperfect
detectors. The transmission distance further increases in asymmetric scenarios. In the extreme case where
Charlie is on Bob’s side, such that the coherent-state-based protocol achieves zero transmission distance,
the squeezed-state protocol significantly outperforms it, especially with the introduction of optimal Gaus-
sian noise levels on Bob’s side, as determined for maximizing key rate and transmission distance under
reverse reconciliation. Chen et al. [366] extended this protocol against general attacks using entropic un-
certainty relations, yielding a composable security analysis and demonstrating the system’s resilience to
a maximum channel loss of 0.64 dB. One key limitation of Gaussian-modulated protocols is their low rec-
onciliation efficiency in long-distance transmissions, which has driven interest in discrete modulation. Ma
et al. [367] proposed a four-state discrete-modulated CV-MDI-QKD protocol, leveraging nonorthogonal
coherent states for encoding bits, achieving longer transmission distances and simplified implementation
compared to Gaussian modulation, with the eight-state protocol [368] further improving key rates and
modulation variances. Wilkinson et al. [369] introduced postselection in long-distance CV-MDI-QKD,
extending the communication range to 14 km over standard optical fiber, while protocols employing
quantum catalysis [370, 371], quantum scissors [372], and multimode signals [373] further improved per-
formance by improving transmission distance and reducing noise. Practical implementation challenges,
such as independent light sources, phase reference calibration, and external disturbances, require miti-
gation to prevent overestimation of key rates. Ma et al. [374] studied phase calibration imperfections
and their thermal noise equivalence, proposing models for realistic security analysis, while Zhao et al.
[368] introduced Bayesian phase-noise estimation to eliminate local oscillator transmission. Simplified
implementations, such as the plug-and-play scheme [375, 376], address synchronization issues by deriving
local oscillators from a shared laser, reducing complexity and enhancing stability. However, imperfections
in state preparation also introduce Gaussian noise, as modeled by Ma et al. [374], who explored intensity
error impacts under various distributions and emphasized placing stable sources on the encoder’s side for
optimization. Countermeasures like Huang et al.’s one-time calibration method [377] and noise charac-
terization approaches are critical for enhancing practical security. Addressing transmittance fluctuations,
Zheng et al.
[378] highlighted performance degradation under varying channel conditions, proposing
Gaussian post-selection to mitigate risks of denial-of-service attacks, while Li et al. [379] studied the ef-
fects of non-ideal Bell detection due to angle errors, showing significant transmission distance reductions
even with minor errors. Efforts to reduce CV-MDI-QKD complexity include self-referenced schemes [380],
shared optical path methods [381], and unidimensional modulation [382], achieving comparable perfor-
mance with reduced system demands. Semi-Quantum Key Distribution (SQKD), introduced by Boyer
et al. [383], evolved into a continuous variable version [384], enabling secure communication between
classical and quantum users, leveraging Charlie’s full quantum capabilities to balance cost-effectiveness
and security under various attack scenarios.
Finite-size effects. The impact of finite-size effects on the key rate of CV-MDI-QKD was initially in-
vestigated by Papanastasiou et al. [385], considering two-mode Gaussian attacks, and by Zhang et al.
[386], examining collective attacks. To study the security of the protocol, a potent approach is to employ
the entanglement-based representation, where the description of the dynamics occurs within an extended
Hilbert space, allowing the use of pure states. The protocol is outlined as follows: Alice and Bob employ
sources of coherent states, which are purified, assuming they start from two-mode squeezed vacuum states
ρaA and ρbB, where modes A and B are transmitted over the communication links, while local modes a
and b are heterodyned. The measurements project the traveling modes into pure coherent states. The
attenuation of the channel on modes A and B is modeled using two beam splitters with transmissivities
τA and τB, where 0 ≤τA, τB ≤1. These processes manipulate Alice and Bob’s signals with a pair of
Eve’s ancillary systems E1 and E2, which generally belong to a broader reservoir of modes controlled by
