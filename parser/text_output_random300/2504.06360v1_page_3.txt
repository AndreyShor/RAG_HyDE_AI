The system thus relaxes to the minimal energy state,

This equation constitutes the main result of the current
work. In the following, we show that the energy relax-
ation crucially affects both the dispersion of elementary
excitations and the spatio-temporal dynamics of polari-
tion droplets.
Dispersion of elementary excitations and superfluidity.
It is a known fact that the dispersion of elementary exci-
tations of a conservative spatially homogeneous conden-
sate with density ρ0 is gapless and linear in k, and at
small momenta is described by the widely known Bogoli-
ubov formula ω(k) =
p
gρ0/mk, which according to the
Landau criterium corresponds to the onset of superfluid-
ity in the system, with
vc =
rgρ0
m
(15)
being a critical velocity.
This result can be obtained directly from Eq. 1 by cal-
culating the dispersion of small excitation on the back-
ground of the spatially uniform condensate. We can ap-
ply a similar procedure to analyze how the pure energy
relaxation will affect the dispersion.
The total field corresponding to a condensate of a den-
sity ρ0 and an excitation with wavevector q and fre-
quency ω is:
ψ(r, t) = e−i gρ0
ℏt h√ρ0 + ξei(q·r−ωt) + ¯ξ∗e−i(q·r−ωt)i
,
(16)
where ξ, and ¯ξ are the amplitudes of the small perturba-
tions, |ξ|2, |¯ξ|2 ≪ρ0. Placing ansatz Eq.16 in Eq.14 and
linearizing it, one gets the following for the dispersion of
elementary excitation:

The real and imaginary parts of the dispersions are shown
in Figure 1. Note that in small q the real part of the
dispersion remains linear ∂ω/∂q|q=0 = vc and therefore,
according to the Landau criterion, the condensate is su-
perfluid with critical velocity vc independently of λ. The
negative imaginary part is responsible for the decay of
the excitations provided by the pure energy relaxation
term, which scales quadratically with q and is propor-
tional to the condensate density ρ0, which, as expected,
reflects the effect of bosonic stimulation.
Let us remark that both the effect of polariton su-
perfluidity [7, 8] and the formation of a linear polariton
dispersion above the condensation threshold in a dissipa-
tive system was reported experimentally [15, 16]. Note
also that models of dissipative polariton fluids without
pure energy relaxation give a qualitatively different dis-
persion, with flat regions in energy bands [11, 17], and
no clean superfluid behavior [18].
The onset of a superfluid behavior in our model can
be directly tested numerically.
Consider an obstacle

where V0, wp and vp are the
depth, width and velocity of the potential.
The results of the 2D simulations are shown in Fig. 2.
The four upper panels illustrate the supersonic cases of
obstacle motion in the absence (a),(b) and in the pres-
ence λ = 1.4 · 10−3 µm4 · ps−1 of the energy relaxation.
The cones of the emitted waves are clearly seen in panels
(a),(c). In the corresponding spatial spectra, see panels
(b), (d), there are characteristic patterns corresponding
to the phase matching condition Re[ω(q)] = vpqx, where
q is a wavevector of a scattered wave.
The difference
introduced by the energy relaxation is that in this case
the emitted waves slowly decay so that the field becomes
localized (c), and the amplitudes of the scattered waves
with high momenta are suppressed (compare panels (b)
and (d)), since the decay rate of the linear excitations
