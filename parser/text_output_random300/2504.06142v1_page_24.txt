Accordingly, in four-component notation the Weyl spinors in the Weyl basis are (ψL, 0) and
(0, ψR), and are eigenfunctions of γ5 with eigenvalues −1 and +1, respectively.
The usual Majorana condition for a Dirac spinor has the form, ψ = C ¯ψT , where C
is the charge-conjugation matrix. In four dimensions C is off-diagonal in the Weyl basis,
since it maps the components transforming as (2, 1) into (1, 2). For even D, it is always
possible to define a Weyl basis where ΓD+1 (which consists of the product of all matrices in
D dimensions) is diagonal, therefore
ΓD+1ψ± = ±ψ± .
(120)
We can express ΓD+1 in terms of the chirality operators in four and extra d dimensions,
ΓD+1 = γ5 ⊗γd+1 .
(121)
As a result, the eigenvalues of γ5 and γd+1 are interrelated. It should be noted though that
the choice of the eigenvalue of ΓD+1 does not impose the eigenvalues on the separate γ5 and
γd+1.
Given that ΓD+1 commutes with the Lorentz generators, then each of the ψ+ and ψ−
corresponding to its two eigenvalues, according to eq. (120), transforms as an irreducible
spinor of SO(1, D−1). For D even, the SO(1, D−1) always has two independent irreducible
spinors; for D = 4n there are two self-conjugate spinors σD and σd′, while for D = 4n + 2,
σD is non-self-conjugate and ¯σD is the other spinor. Conventionally, it is selected ψ−∼σD
and ψ+ ∼σD′ or ¯σD. Then, Dirac spinors are defined as direct sum of Weyl spinors,
ψ = ψ+ ⊕ψ−∼
(
σD ⊕σ′
D
for D = 4n
σD ⊕¯σD
for D = 4n + 2 .
(122)
The Majorana condition can be imposed in D = 2, 3, 4 + 8n dimensions and therefore
the Majorana and Weyl conditions are compatible only in D = 4n + 2 dimensions. We limit
ourselves here in the case that D = 4n + 2 (or the rest see e.g. refs [9, 17]). Then starting
with Weyl–Majorana spinors in D = 4n + 2 dimensions, we are actually forcing a rep, fR, of
a gauge group defined in higher dimensions to be the charge conjugate of fL, and we arrive
in this way to a four-dimensional theory with the fermions only in the fL rep of the gauge
group.
Lets discuss our example now, keeping again the Euclidean signature, with the Weyl
spinor of SO(18), 256 and according to the breakings and branching rules discussed earlier
in the present section we have
SO(18) ⊃SU(4) × SO(12)
256 = (4, 32) + (4, 32) .
(123)
Given that the Majorana condition can also be imposed we are led to have fermions in the
(4, 32) of SU(4) × SO(12). Then we have the following branching rule of the 32 under the
SO(10) × [U(1)]
SO(12) ⊃SO(10) × [U(1)]
32 = (16)(1) + (16)(−1) .
