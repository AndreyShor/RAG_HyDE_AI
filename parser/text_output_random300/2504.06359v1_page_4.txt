than t, they abandon the communication and
submit random strings to the controller.
The error check will fail with high probability because
ct and r are independently random strings, and the ex-
pected number of matching bits is k1/2. For instance,
using similar parameters as in [26], with k1 = 5000 and
t = 10%, the probability that the number of unmatched
bits between ct and r is smaller than 500 is approximately
10−100 ≈2−332.19, a rare event.
The controller cannot distinguish whether the failure is
caused by covert communication or eavesdropping. This
is because, by the no-cloning theorem and wavefunction
collapse, both cases result in a random r. Also, by the
same reason, Colin has no idea whether the one-time pad
ciphertext ct is truly a valid substring of b, unless he had
used Alice’s secret basis (which he does not know) to
eavesdrop Alice’s photons.
If the error checking accidentally passes, Alice and Bob
submit fake shared keys ¯K to Colin in a way similar to the
naive approach. Again, by no-cloning and wavefunction
collapse, Colin has no idea whether ¯K is the true shared
secret.
Overall, in a one-time execution of the revised BB84,
Colin statistically / informationally has no advantage in
telling whether Alice and Bob are exchanging covert in-
formation.
As to the security against a typical attacker, note that
Colin can be viewed as an upgraded Eve, with access to
additional information beyond Eve can. Hence if Colin
cannot detect whether Alice and Bob are exchanging
covert messages, then Eve cannot gain any information
of the covert message either.
Similar to traditional attacks in quantum communica-
tion, both Colin and Eve can disrupt the communication
by eavesdropping on the photons. But they cannot learn
anything about the covert messages.

COVERT KEY DISTRIBUTION IN DL04
We consider the third controller for DL04 [25], this
controller knows the secret basis of the photon sender.
A.
Controller for DL04
DL04 is essentially BB84 with photon encoding and re-
turning. Its main idea is to encode each message bit into
a photon by ﬂipping its state using unitary operations.
It runs as follows:
1. Photons Sending Phase:
• Bob generates two random strings a
=
(a1, . . . , an) ∈{0, 1}n and b = (b1, . . . , bn) ∈
{0, 1}n, prepares a sequence of photons p =
(|ϕa1b1⟩,..., |ϕanbn⟩) such that |ϕ00⟩= |0⟩,
|ϕ01⟩= |1⟩, |ϕ10⟩= |+⟩, and |ϕ11⟩= |−⟩, and
sends them to Alice over a quantum channel.
Call this batch of photons the A-batch.
• Alice randomly chooses a batch of photons to
complete a typical BB84 error rate estimation
process with Bob. Call this batch of photons
the S-batch.
• If the error rate is too high, Bob concludes
that the communication is insecure, and the
protocol is aborted. If the error rate is suﬃ-
ciently low, the remaining photons, called the
B-batch (suppose its size is k), will be used to
do encryption.
2. Photons Returning Phase:
• After conﬁrming the security of the B-batch,
Alice proceeds to encode the message m =
{0, 1}k by encoding each photon in the B-
batch with one of two possible operations:
• I = |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|
• U = iσy = |0⟩⟨1| −|1⟩⟨0|
where if mi = 0 then apply I on the i-th pho-
ton of the B-batch, otherwise apply U on it,
resulting in a batch of encoded photons.
– The operation I does not have any af-
fects, and U has the following eﬀects on
the states:
• U|0⟩= −|1⟩,
U|1⟩= |0⟩
• U|+⟩= |−⟩,
U|−⟩= −|+⟩
Alice sends the encoded B-batch to Bob.
• Bob measures the photons using the correct
bases which he knows, resulting in a string
d = (d1, . . . , dk) ∈{0, 1}k. Bob then extracts
the subsequence e ∈{0, 1}k of a corresponding
to the positions of the B-batch in the A-batch,
and recovers the message as m′ = d ⊗e.
• To ensure the security of the transmission, Al-
ice randomly selects some photons from the B-
batch as checking instances to check the error
rate with Bob.
There are also three main secrets in DL04:
1. the message m;
2. the state selection string b;
3. the basis selection string a.
We consider a very strong controller who demands all
three of them (in principle, he can demand everything he
has evidence of existence). Speciﬁcally:
Controller IV: This controller requires Bob to
share two secrets a, b with him using BB84 before
starting DL04 with Alice, and requires him to use
a, b as the basis selection string and state selection
