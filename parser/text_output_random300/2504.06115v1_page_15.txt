The geometric interpretation of the coeﬃcient b is not yet understood, except when X
is smooth, i.e. N = 1, in which case b = J · c2(TX). More generally, we observe that in all
of the examples that have been considered in [15, 16] and in this paper it takes values b ∈Z.
The coeﬃcient σ ∈1

Higher genus free energies and holomorphic anomaly equations
The B-model genus g topological string free energy Fg(z, ¯z) is a section of L2−2g. To be inde-
pendent of the choice of K¨ahler gauge, one can introduce Fg(t, ¯t) = ̟0(z)2g−2Fg(z, ¯z)

z→z(t).
We refer to the quantities Fg(t) that one obtains in the holomorphic limit
Fg(t) = lim
¯t→i∞Fg(t, ¯t) ,
(3.16)
as the A-model topological string free energies. They are related to the topological string
partition function in (3.2) via
log ZX
top.(t, [k]N, λ) =
X
g≥0
λ2g−2Fg(t) .
(3.17)
The genus zero free energies are already holomorphic and the prepotential (3.12) can be
identiﬁed with F(t) = −F0(t). In the holomorphic limit, the derivative of the K¨ahler potential
and the Weil-Petersson metric respectively become
Kz →−∂z log ̟0(z) ,
Gz¯z →∂zt .
(3.18)
12As for some of our examples, it can happen that there is a second MUM-point in the moduli space that
is related via mirror symmetry to an ordinary smooth Calabi-Yau threefold. In those cases the Gamma-class
formula, see e.g. [54], can be used to determine an integral basis of periods around that point and numerical
analytic continuation yields a corresponding basis around z = 0.
