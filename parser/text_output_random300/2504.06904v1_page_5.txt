The practical examples mentioned mainly pertain to 
the quantitative method. In our research, however, the 
focus was on the analytical method. Specifically, it 
involved developing a reporting Figure to establish a 
reliable information base for dispatch centers to 
effectively manage the gas dynamic processes in non-
stationary modes. As mentioned above, accidents 
occurring in parallel gas pipelines operating in a unified 
hydraulic regime cause a decrease in pressure throughout 
all sections of both pipeline networks over time. The 
decrease in pressure at the end section of the pipeline 
deteriorates the process of gas supply to consumers. 
If we assume that the pressure difference is fully 
utilized by all consumers, then as the consumption of the 
initial gas mass in the network increases, the pressure at 
its end point will decrease again, leading to various 
devices and appliances experiencing different levels of 
disruption. Devices and appliances operating at maximum 
pressure will immediately sense the drop in gas pressure, 
reducing their numbers in operation simultaneously. In 
such a regime, only devices and appliances close to the 
nominal pressure will be able to operate. Therefore, these 
issues should be addressed in the reconstruction of 
existing gas pipelines. Based on the principles of the 
reconstruction phase, selecting an efficient technological 
figure that perfectly manages the technological and 
emergency processes of gas transportation is essential.  
As we know, the reliability indicator of main gas 
pipelines directly depends on providing consumers with 
the required uninterrupted gas supply [5, 13]. Among the 
complex gas pipeline systems that excel at fulfilling this 
function is the parallel gas pipeline system. As a result of 
accidents, we adopt the following technological Figure 
for the efficient management of gas pipelines, the 
detection of leakage points, and the provision of 
uninterrupted gas supply to consumers in complex gas 
pipeline systems [7].

In the proposed gas transportation Figure, at the 
fixed 
moment

technological 
measures 
are 
implemented to isolate the damaged section from the 
main part of the pipeline. Specifically, the location of the 
damaged section is detected in the shortest possible time   
(

), and the positions of the valves installed to the right 
(
1
)and left (

) of the leakage point are identified and 
closed by the dispatcher center at that moment. Based on 
the principle of managing technological measures, it is 
recommended to install automatic valves at the starting 
section of the pipeline network to the right of the first 
connector (4.1) and to the left of the last connector (4.2). 
In the normal (stationary) operating regime of gas 
pipelines, the valves on the connectors are closed, while 
the valves on the pipelines are open. In emergency 
situations (when the pipeline's integrity is compromised), 
the valves to the right and left of the leakage point on the 
pipeline are closed

As shown in Figure 5 to ensure an adequate gas 
supply to consumers, the valves (5.1 and 5.2) located to 
the right and left of the leakage point on the connecting 
pipeline are opened under the control of dispatcher center 
management panels. The main distinguishing feature of 
the proposed gas pipeline compared to the existing one is 
its operation in an independent hydraulic regime. Another 
key difference of the reconstructed gas pipeline is the 
independence of the pipeline dynamics from each other 
during emergencies and technological regimes. The 
proposed parallel gas pipeline is a complex system 
characterized by a compressor station serving each 
pipeline at the starting section and numerous elements 
such as connectors and valves.
