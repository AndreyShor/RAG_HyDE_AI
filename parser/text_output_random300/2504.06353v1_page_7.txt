Figure 2. The NLO (left) and NNLO (right) on-shell Z cross-section differential in TCj, split into
its singular and non-singular components.
The values of the xi are determined by comparing the sizes of singular and non-
singular contributions at fixed order, as discussed in ref. [16]. In figures 1 and 2 we plot the
singular, non-singular and full fixed-order cross sections for TBj and TCj respectively, for
the simplified case of on-shell Z boson production (given that we only consider Q ∼MZ
this is sufficient for the purpose of setting the profile scales). The left hand pane presents
the NLO results that can be used to determine the xi for the NLL′+NLO prediction, whilst
the right pane gives the NNLO results for the NNLL′+NNLO prediction. We see that, as
expected, the singular cross section is dominant at small T cut, since the singular cross
section diverges as 1/T cut, whilst the non-singular only diverges logarithmically at small
T cut.
We use x0 = 2.5/µFO as in ref. [7] to define the non-pertubative region. From the left
hand panes of figures 1 and 2, we determine that at NLL′+NLO, the xi parameters have
the same value {x1,x2,x3} = {0.20,0.55,0.90} for both TBj and TCj. At NNLL′+NNLO,
we find from the right hand panes of figures 1 and 2 that the values of xi for TBj and TCj
should be {x1,x2,x3} = {0.20,0.50,0.80} and {x1,x2,x3} = {0.15,0.45,0.75} respectively.
Note that our choice of the xi for TBj at NNLL′+NNLO coincides with the choice made in
ref. [58] for beam thrust T0 in Drell-Yan at NNLL′+NNLO.
