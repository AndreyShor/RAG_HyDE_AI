a(X(t), t) = −∇V (X(t))
i.e. for our unit mass particle the Nelson/Newton Law,
Force = Mass × Acceleration,
the analogue of Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion. We should remark that this original result
is much more general than the simple version given here and is applicable to much more
general quantum Hamiltonians. For details see Refs. [18] and [19].
Nelson’s theory never proved popular because of certain philosophical problems but it
does have one enormous advantage over Schr¨odinger quantum mechanics; it enables
one to predict first arrival times for quantum particles or at least their probability
distributions in a very simple way. Many experimentalists think these are obervable
and they are impossible to predict in Schr¨odinger or Heisenberg theories in any straight
forward way.
Semi-classical mechanics and the limiting case of Nelson’s stochastic
mechanics open a new window on such times.
We next give a brief account of two of the main theorems supporting our ideas. These
should be read alongside Freidlin and Wentzell, Ref.[13], which sheds more light on these
issues.
5.2. Classical Mechanics as a Limiting Case of Schr¨odinger Quantum Mechanics
We now prove the main theorem of this section. For each fixed t ∈(0, T), we assume that
Dt : x0 →x[x0, ∇S0(x0), t] is a C1 diffeomorphism Dt : Rn →Rn, with D0 = id, and C1
inverse D−1
t
: x →x0(x, t), D−1
t
: Rn →Rn. Denote by Jt(x) or Jt(x0) the Jacobian of
D−1
t , Jt(x0) = Jt(x) = |∂xi
0/∂xj|, where it is understood that, if Jt(x0) is required, we
put x = x[x0, ∇S0(x0), t]. Then we assume that S = {x ∈Rn|Jt(x) = 0} has Lebesgue
measure zero. Given sufficient regularity there is a global inversion function theorem
guaranteeing that these conditions are satisfied for sufficiently small T. (See Ref. [11]).
We then have the theorem:
Theorem 5.1. Let ψℏ(x, t) be the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation
∂ψℏ
∂t = iℏ

with Cauchy data ψℏ(x, 0) = exp{iS0(x)/ℏ}ϕ0 ∈L2(Rn), where V ∈{L2(Rn)+L∞(Rn)}
is real-valued and ϕ0 (independent of ℏ) is such that F(τ) = ||∇2

(x)ϕ0[x0(x, τ)]||L2
∈L1(0, t), || ||L2 being the L2 norm with respect to x. Then, for each fixed t ∈(0, T),
