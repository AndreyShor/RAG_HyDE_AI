Abstract— Planar Hall magnetoresistive sensors (PHMR) are promising candidates for various magnetic sensing 
applications due to their high sensitivity, low power consumption, and compatibility with integrated circuit technology. 
However, their performance is often limited by inherent noise sources, impacting their resolution and overall sensitivity. 
Here the effect of three bilayer structures NiFe(10 nm)/IrMn(10 nm), NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(10 nm), and NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(20 
nm) on noise levels is investigated at low-frequency (DC - 25 Hz). This study includes a detailed investigation on the 
optimization process and noise characteristics of multiring PHMR sensors, focusing on identifying and quantifying the 
dominant noise sources. The experimental measurements are complemented by a theoretical analysis of noise sources 
including thermal noise, 1/f noise, intermixing and environmental noise. The best magnetic resolution is observed for the 
NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(10 nm) structure, which achieves a detectivity below 1.5 nT/√Hz at 10 Hz in a non-shielded 
environment at room temperature. In addition, a substantial improvement in sensitivity is observed by annealing the 
sensors at 250 °C for 1 hour. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of noise behavior in PHMR 
sensors, paving the way for developing strategies to improve their performance for demanding sensing applications at 
low frequencies.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
The demand for sensitive and miniaturized magnetic field 
sensors is continuously increasing, driven by applications in various 
fields such as the automotive industry [Treutler 2001], consumer 
electronics [Melzer 2015], biomedical sensing [Murzin 2020], space 
exploration [Brown 2012], archaeology [Wunderlich 2022], flexible 
electronics [Granell 2019, Nhalil 2023], nanomagnetic bead detection 
[Das 2021], multi-axis sensing [Das 2024]. Compared to various 
magnetoresistance (MR) based sensing technologies such as the 
anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), giant magnetoresistance 
(GMR) and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), planar Hall 
magnetoresistance (PHMR) sensors have emerged as promising 
candidates due to attractive features such as their high sensitivity, low 
power consumption, small size and compatibility with standard 
microfabrication processes [Lim 2022]. The working principle of 
PHMR relies on the planar Hall effect, which manifests as a resistance 
change of a ferromagnetic material when subjected to an in-plane 
magnetic field. This resistance change is proportional to the sine of 
twice the angle between the current direction and the applied 
magnetic field [Mor 2017]. 
 
Despite their advantages, the performance of PHMR sensors is 
often limited by inherent noise sources, which can mask the desired 
magnetic signal and degrade the sensor's resolution. Recent studies on 
PHMR sensors have focused on increasing their magnetic field 
sensitivity and resolution, either by changing the sensor material 
structure or its geometry. In this, exchange biased (EB) planar-Hall

sensors hold a crucial role in order to enhance sensor sensitivity and 
operational dynamic range [Piskin 2020, Lim 2022]. Understanding 
the origin and characteristics of noise in PHMR sensors plays a key 
role in developing strategies to mitigate its impact and improve the 
sensor's overall performance [Elzwawy 2021, Lim 2022].  
 
The best resolution of planar Hall sensors is reported till date ~ 
5 pT/√Hz at 10 Hz [Das 2021 and Nhalil 2019] integrating magnetic 
flux concentrators and in magnetic shielding. Without magnetic 
shielding and concentrators, the reported value is ~ 24 pT/√Hz at 10 
Hz [Nhalil, 2020]. For planar Hall sensors with a meander ring 
structure, the best reported value is in the range of 550 pT/√Hz at 100 
Hz in an unshielded environment [Jeon 2021]. It is also important to 
mention that there are few reports in the literature showing the 
performance of the sensors in unshielded environments and 
highlighting their operational range. In the literature, mostly IrMn(10 
nm)/NiFe(10 nm) structures are used as reference. For this reason, we 
changed the layer thickness of the sensor stack to investigate the role 
of the pinning effect of the exchange bias on the sensitivity and noise 
of the sensor.  
Therefore, the aim of this work is to further improve the performance 
of exchange biased (EB) PHMR sensors and to investigate the noise 
characteristics of the sensors. In the EB mechanism, a unidirectional 
anisotropy is formed inside the sensor material by a magnetic 
coupling between FM and AFM layers at the material interface 
[Nogués 1999]. A focus lies on identifying and quantifying the 
improved sensor material structure and the dominant noise 
mechanisms affecting the sensor's performance in non-shielded
