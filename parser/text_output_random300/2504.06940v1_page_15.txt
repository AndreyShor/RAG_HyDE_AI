Let’s define g(β) = µ −1
2(1 + s2)β to be the linear approximation around for f(β). We find that:
(
g (2(µ −cε)) = −s2µ + (1 + s2)cε ⩾(c + s2(c −1))ε
g (2(µ + cε)) = −s2µ −(1 + s2)cε ⩽−(1 + s2)cε
(71)
Since −(1 + s2)c = −(c + s2c) ⩽−(c + s2c −c) = −(c + s2(c −1)) we combine these two equations into:
(
g (2(µ −cε)) ⩾(c + s2(c −1))ε
g (2(µ + cε)) ⩽−(c + s2(c −1))ε
(72)
Let the difference between f and g at 2(µ ± cε) be ∆±, we can bound it with
∆± = |f (2(µ ± cε)) −g (2(µ ± cε))| = 1

Using λ ⩾5, we obtain χ ⩽1.3410 and D ⩽1.88203. This gives ∆± ⩽6.635 via Eq. (73). The constraint we

∴(1 + s2)c −s2 ⩾6.635s2
∴(c + (s2)(c −1))ε ⩾6.635s2ε ⩾∆±
(74)
Combined with Eq. (72) we then reach the conclusion that f(2(µ −cε)) ⩾0 and f(2(µ + cε)) ⩽0. This demonstrates
that there is a solution α ∈[2(µ −cε), 2(µ + cε)].
As the second part of the proof, we show that the probability for α is sufficiently high. First, Eq. (65) becomes

Theorem III.4 gives a pretty good result of the properties of the Grover gate. However, there are some nasty
constraints and irregularities, namely a factor 2 in the eigenvalue, a lot of tan functions, and an enforced upper bound
for all instances of the random variables. The following theorem cleans things up:
