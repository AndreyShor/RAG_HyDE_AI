More recently, the Korean research group improved the low-ﬁeld Jc of thin-ﬁlm
HEAs[73]. The team modiﬁed the target alloy preparation method, replacing the ball-
milling and hot-press sintering process with arc melting followed by thermal annealing.
Two samples, HEA550 and HEA700, were prepared, corresponding to ﬁlms fabricated
using targets annealed at 550 ◦C and 700 ◦C, respectively. Remarkably, HEA700
demonstrates a low-ﬁeld Jc of approximately 4.4 MA/cm2 (at 2 K) and 3.5 MA/cm2
(at 4 K), outperforming the thin-ﬁlm sample deposited at Ts=520 ◦C reported in
Nature Communications. The ﬂux pinning force densities for the HEA550 and HEA700
samples are documented in Ref.[73]. In both samples, the force density at 2 K peaks
at approximately 1 T, with maximum values of 2.34 GN/m3 for HEA550 and 9.83
GN/m3 for HEA700. The normal point pinning model describes the magnetic ﬁeld
dependence of ﬂux pinning force density in each sample well. The authors attribute
the point pinning mechanism to the severe lattice distortion eﬀect in the ”four core
eﬀects” of HEA.
The Jc values of the HEA thin-ﬁlm samples reviewed here decline below 105 A/cm2
as the magnetic ﬁeld increases beyond approximately 3 T. The feasibility of their
practical application as superconducting wires depends on the development of ﬂux
pinning sites eﬀective at higher magnetic ﬁelds.
3.4 Annealing eﬀect on Jc of arc-melted sample
In 2022, Gao et al. reported a remarkable enhancement of Jc in thermally annealed
bulk (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 HEA, as discussed below[54]. Similarly, in 2024, the Korean
research team investigated the annealing eﬀects in bulk Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6,
reporting a thermally-driven dramatic enhancement of Jc[74]. The arc-melted sam-
ples were thermally annealed for 24 hours at temperatures ranging from 400 ◦C to
1000 ◦C. Notably, the lattice parameter a0 demonstrated signiﬁcant sensitivity to the
annealing temperature (Fig. 8). While a0 remained nearly constant up to 400 ◦C, it
began to decrease sharply above this threshold, reaching a minimum of approximately
3.32 ˚A at 700 ◦C, before increasing again with higher annealing temperatures. The
contraction of a0 to 3.32 ˚A suggests the introduction of lattice strain in the annealed
Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6.
The annealing temperature dependence of Tc exhibits only minor variation with
annealing temperature. Conversely, µ0Hc2(0) decreases monotonically with increasing
annealing temperature. The value of µ0Hc2(0), initially 13.27 T in the as-cast sample,
diminishes to 9.07 T after annealing at 1000 ◦C, a trend that does not strongly correlate
with the annealing eﬀects on Tc.
Thermal annealing induces more signiﬁcant changes in Jc than in Tc or µ0Hc2(0)
(Figs. 9(a) and (b)). In these ﬁgures, the ”Bare sample” refers to the as-cast state. The
self-ﬁeld Jc of the bare sample is approximately 39 kA/cm2 at 2 K and 28 kA/cm2
at 4.2 K, both decreasing rapidly under an external magnetic ﬁeld. However, samples
annealed at 500 - 700 ◦C exhibit substantial improvements in self-ﬁeld Jc and ﬁeld
performance. For instance, the self-ﬁeld Jc at 4.2 K for the sample annealed at 550
◦C is enhanced by approximately 1860 % compared to the bare sample. In terms
of ﬁeld performance, the Jc at 2 K for the 550 ◦C annealed sample surpasses 100
kA/cm2 even at 4 T, whereas the bare sample’s Jc drops to 10 A/cm2 under a ﬁeld
