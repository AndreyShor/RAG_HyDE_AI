Figure 11: (a) Ground truth streamwise velocity components at t = 428. (b) Comparison
of the predicted streamwise velocity components for HOSVD (left column) and SVD (right
column) across different LSTM architectures. From top to bottom: predictions for LSTM
with 1 Dense, 2 Dense, and Time-Distributed architectures.
components are summarized in Tables 9 and 10. In the streamwise direction, HOSVD
demonstrates improved predictive accuracy over SVD in the 1 dense, 2 dense, and time-
distributed architectures. For the normal component, error values are generally higher
due to the presence of large zero regions in the flow field.
Since the model predicts
these values with machine error, it increases the RRMSE. But for both the decomposition
techniques and across all the architectures, the RRMSE values are quite similar, with
HOSVD maintaining a slight advantage over SVD.
