need to ﬁnd a normal Z4 subgroup of Q8 whose Z2 subgroup is central in Q8. In
fact, Q8 has three diﬀerent Z4 normal subgroups satisfying this property. There-
fore, one has three diﬀerent normal inclusions of H(2) into (a gauge twist of) the
group algebra CQ8, so that we have three diﬀerent anomaly resolutions
Rep(Z2 × Z2) →Rep(Q8) →Vec(Z2,α),
(7.25)
as suggested by the three candidate condensable algebras proposed above.

Further examples: group-theoretic categories
More examples of anomaly resolutions of invertible symmetries can be obtained
via group-theoretical fusion categories. Given a ﬁnite group G with a nontrivial
3-cocycle ω ∈Z3(G,U(1)), and an exact factorization G = HK such that ω∣H ∈
Z3(H,U(1)) is trivial, there is an exact sequence of fusion categories
Rep(H) ↪C(G,ω,H,1) →Vec(K,ω∣K),
(7.26)
where Vec(K,ω∣K) is anomalous due to the nontrivial 3-cocycle ω∣K ∈Z3(K,U(1)).
This is [27, Corollary 4.4.i].
In the case C(G,ω,H,1) is non-anomalous, then this is the anomaly resolution
by a Rep(H) extension (which may involve non-invertible simples).
This recovers well-known results, such as
Rep(Z2 × Z2) ↪Rep(D4) ≅C(Z3
2,ω,Z2
2,1) →Vec(Z2,ω∣Z2),
(7.27)
and
Rep(Z2) ↪Rep(H8) ≅C(D4,ω,Z2,1) →Vec(Z2 × Z2,ω∣Z2×Z2).

Conclusions
In this paper, we have outlined the generalized notion of anomaly resolution in two-
dimensional theories from ordinary groups to noninvertible symmetries. We gave
a general discussion in terms of both SymTFT and Hopf algebra constructions,
discussed how the ordinary group construction is a special case, then considered
examples in which ordinary groups with anomalies were replaced by noninvertible
symmetries.
