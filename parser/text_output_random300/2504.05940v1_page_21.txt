In this paper, we decompose the Nambu bracket into the Poisson bracket
with respect to σ1 and σ2 as follows:
{XI, XJ, XK} = {τ(XI, XJ), XK}+ ∂XK
∂σ3 {XI, XJ}+Σ(XI, XJ; XK) (B.4)
where {XI, XJ} denotes the Poisson bracket with respect to σ1 and σ2, deﬁned
by
{XI, XJ} ≡ǫab ∂XI
∂σa
∂XJ
∂σb ,
(B.5)
with a = 1, 2. The functions Σ(A, B; C) and τ(A, B) are deﬁned as
Σ(A, B; C) ≡A{ ∂B
∂σ3 , C} −B{ ∂A
∂σ3 , C},
(B.6)
τ(A, B) ≡∂A
∂σ3 B −∂B
∂σ3 A.
(B.7)
Both of these expressions are antisymmetric with respect to A and B. This
decomposition is simply an equivalent rewriting of the Nambu bracket.
Using this decomposition, the volume-preserving deformation (VPD) can be
expressed as
δVPDXI = {τ(Q1, Q2), XI} + ∂XI
∂σ3 {Q1, Q2} + Σ(Q1, Q2; XI).

B.2 Main Claim
We impose the “gauge restriction condition”1011
CI
∂XI
∂σ3 = σ3,
(B.9)
where CI is a ﬁxed Lorentz vector in spacetime.
By integrating the gauge restriction condition, we obtain
CIXI = 1
2(σ3)2 + f(σ1, σ2)
(B.10)
where f(σ1, σ2) appears as an integration constant along the σ3 direction. As
long as it is suﬃciently smooth and satisﬁes appropriate boundary conditions,
it can take arbitrary values.
10In this work, we use the term "gauge restriction condition" instead of "gauge ﬁxing con-
dition." This is because it does not refer to the elimination of redundant degrees of freedom
in the usual sense, but rather denotes an algebraic constraint required for the consistency of
the theoretical construction.
11More generally, the gauge restriction condition can be written as CI ∂XI
∂σ3 = h(σ3) , where
h(σ3) is a monotonic function. In this paper, we simply take h(σ3) = σ3for convenience.
