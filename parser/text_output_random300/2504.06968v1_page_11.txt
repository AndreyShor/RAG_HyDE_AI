narrow and bright emission feature between 1 MeV and 3 MeV. ∆χ2 represents the statistical
difference in the goodness-of-fit between the models Band and Band+Gaussian, the ∆χ2 values
are displayed in Table 2. The highest ∆χ2 value of 40.14 was observed in the time interval 8−30 s,
while the ∆χ2 values for the other time intervals ranged from 18.53 to 34.49.
Background. The selection of time intervals for background subtraction can also impact the anal-
ysis of the source spectrum. In order to assess the impact of background subtraction on extracted
spectrum.
In time interval 8−30 s, we calculated the background spectrum by selecting several different
time windows. Even with this approach, the narrow emission features are still clearly visible. We
performed both Band and Band + Gaussian fittings in the spectra extracted by subtracting different
backgrounds in time interval 8 −30 s. As shown in Table 3, The central energy Egauss of the
narrow emission feature are all around 2.1 MeV and the widths σgauss are all around 200 keV, and
the values of the ∆AIC are around 50. The result of the narrow Gaussian feature is substantially
unaffected.
In four subintervals (8 −21 s (C.1), (11 −24 s (C.2), 14 −27 s (C.3), 17 −30 s (C.4)), we
extracted the spectra by performing a different selection of the time windows for the background
spectrum computation, the background time intervals selected for each time intervals, for 8 −21 s:
-200−-40 s, 120−250 s; for 11−24 s: -90−-10 s, 100−150 s; for 14−27 s: -90−-20 s, 180−250 s;
for 17 −30 s: -200 −-50 s, 120 −250 s.
Significance calculation of narrow emission feature. We calculated the chance probability value
(p-value) of the narrow emission feature through spectral simulation. The spectral simulation
across the entire energy range (10 keV −30 MeV) is performed using the fakeit command in
XSPEC. These simulations are based on the parameters obtained from fitting the actual data using
the Band model. The tclout simpars (based on the covariance matrix at the best fit) command
in XSPEC is used to generated randomized model parameters before each simulation. The total
number of spectral simulations N is 1.00×107. For each simulated spectra, we perform both Band
and Band+Gaussian fittings (search for Gaussian components across the entire energy range of
10 keV to 30 MeV) and record the maximum ∆χ2 value 20,55. Finally, we assess the significance
of the narrow emission feature by analyzing the ∆χ2 values recorded in Tables 2. The p-value
represents the fraction of simulated ∆χ2
i values that exceeds the observed ∆χ2 value:
p-valuesim = n[∆χ2
i ≥∆χ2]/N.

If after N simulations we still do not obtain a ∆χ2 value exceeding the observed value, we report p-
valuesim < 1/N. The probability distribution function (PDF) of ∆χ2 values obtained from 1 × 107
simulations for different time intervals are shown in Figure 5.
