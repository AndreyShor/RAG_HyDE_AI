Physically-based Indirect illumination with raytracing.
With the pre-trained Gaussian attributes in the initialization,
we have the geometry and radiance field (although not re-
lightable). Besides estimating visibility by ray tracing the
same as Relightable 3DGS [6], we compute the indirect in-
coming radiance Lind
i
by ray tracing in the learned radiance
field.
Specifically, we consider the Gaussians as ellipses,
where the axis lengths are scaled by a factor of three. We
then construct a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) over el-
lipses to accelerate ray tracing. For each Gaussian, we uni-
formly sample K directions on its upper hemisphere. For
each sampled direction, we emit a ray starting from the
Gaussian center x with direction ωk
i and query the Gaus-
sians along the ray using the BVH. Then, we accumulate
the transmittance T as Eqn. (3) and the radiance along each
ray as Lind:

where visibility to the environment map V is determined by
T and ε is a threshold, set as 0.8 in practice. Lind(x, ωi) is
the indirect radiance accumulated from Gaussian radiance
field, cl and αl is the radiance field color and transparency
of Gaussian l. Next, the radiance of Gaussian vertex is com-
puted by Eqn. (9).
4.4. Relighting with SVG-IR
The learned indirect illumination from previous works [6,
11, 20, 24] is specifically designed for the lighting condi-
tions present during training. As a result, it cannot be used
for relighting under new lighting conditions. In this section,
we will show how to utilize our trained model for relighting
in novel light environments.
The indirect incoming radiance in Eqn. (12) can not be
used directly, as it’s learned under the training light. There-
fore, we replace Lind
i
in Eqn. (12) with one-bounce indirect
illumination for relighting, as shown in Fig. 5.
For that, we query the Gaussian intersected with the ray
at each direction, so called secondary Gaussian, and the in-
coming radiance Lind
i
(x, ωi) at Gaussian vertex x is equiv-
alent to the outgoing radiance Lo(x′, −ωi) of Gaussian k
from −ωi:

(13)
where f ′ represents the interpolated BRDF of vertices on
Gaussian k. Finally, the radiance of Gaussian vertex is com-
puted by Eqn. (10) and Eqn. (9). This allows us to obtain
dynamic indirect illumination under the new light source.
We show more implementation details in the supplementary
material.
5. Implementation details
5.1. Radiance consistency loss
We observe that the indirect incoming radiance, obtained
through ray tracing in the radiance field, can serve as a su-
pervision for the outgoing radiance of secondary Gaussians
along the sampled K directions. This provides additional
guidance from extra viewpoints. However, performing one-
bounce ray tracing for all Gaussians along the K directions
is costly. We only sample one direction near the specular
reflection for each Gaussian j. The supervision is applied
as follows:
Lrc = |Lind
i
(xj, ωk
i ), Lind′
i
(xj, ωk
i )|,
(14)
where Lind′
i
is the outgoing radiance of the secondary Gaus-
sian on direction ωk
i . For more details, please refer to the
supplementary material.
5.2. Training details
We train our model using Adam optimizer [18] by the uti-
lizing the losses as
L =λ1L1 + λssimLssim + λrcLrc
λnLn + λs,aLs,a + λs,rLs,r + λreg,nLreg,n,
(15)
where L1 and Lssim is L1 loss and SSIM loss between ren-
dered image and ground truth, Lrc is the radiance consis-
tency loss in Sec. 5.1, Ln is one minus cosine similarity
between normal and pseudo normal, Ls,a and Ls,r are TV-
loss on albedo and roughness, Lreg,n is L2 regular term of
normal offsets ∆N M. More details are in the supplemen-
tary.
