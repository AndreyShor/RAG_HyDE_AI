Figure 7. Relighting results. We perform relighting on real dataset DTU. The indirect shading results are in the blue borders. By
recalculating indirect lighting for each new light source, our method avoids the unrealistic bright indirect illumination that Relightable
3DGS [6] exhibits under low-light conditions. More results are in the supplementary material.

Metrics.
We evaluate the quality of our comparison and
ablation study results using PSNR, structural similarity in-
dex (SSIM) [26], and learned perceptual image patch simi-
larity (LPIPS) [34]. To account for the ambiguity between
albedo and lighting, we follow TensoIR by rescaling relight-
ing images according to both the ground truth and predicted
albedo. Additionally, we report the mean training time, both
tested on the same one RTX 4090 setup.
6.2. Comparison with previous works
Relighting on synthetic data.
In Tab. 1, we provide the
numerical relighting results on the TensoIR Synthetic and
ADT datasets. Our method achieves the SOTA relighting
results in almost all scenes. In Fig. 6, we provide the visual
comparison between our method and others. Our method
produces smoother and more detailed relighting renderings,
thanks to our Spatially-varying Gaussian representation and
physically-based illumination.
In contrast, GS-IR shows
noticeable artifacts due to the constant color on a single
Gaussian, and TensoIR produces renderings with missing
details and unnatural lighting effects. Additional metrics on
the datasets, along with more images, are provided in the
supplementary materials.
Relighting on real data.
For real scenes, we conducted
experiments on several scenes selected from the object-
level datasets DTU datasets and scene-level dataset Mip-
NeRF360. Since ground truth is not available, we provide
the reference training views along with the rendering results
under novel lighting conditions. As shown in Fig. 7, the
indirect lighting renderings produced by Relightable 3DGS
under different environment maps remain the same, causing
unnaturally bright renderings even under dark light sources.
On the contrary, our method can dynamically adopt indi-
rect lighting w.r.t. different environment maps due to our
relighting strategy, which uses one-bounce ray tracing to
model indirect illumination.
Similarly, we compare our
method with GS-IR in Fig. 9, showing more natural relight-
ing results.
NVS.
Besides relighting task, we validate our method on
the NVS task, by performing a comparison with other IR
methods [7, 14, 20, 36]. In Tab. 2, our method outperforms
the others on the TensoIR Synthetic and ADT datasets.
The visual comparison is shown in Fig. 8, showing that
our method can produce cleaner results than GS-IR [20]
and Reglitable 3DGS [7] with less artifacts, thanks to the
spatially-varying material in a single Gaussian.
6.3. Ablation study
We perform ablation studies on the key components of our
model on the TensoIR Synthetic dataset in terms of PSNR,
SSIM and LPIPS. As shown in Tab. 3, we observe that as we
incorporate our key components, the performance improves
consistently.
