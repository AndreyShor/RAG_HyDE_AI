Thin section registration in Berea sandstone CT image
We applied the image registration approach to a Berea sandstone digital image. Figure 6 shows the dataset and
preprocessing steps, which convert images from different modalities into the same feature space for image registration.
In this study, we segmented binary images (1 for solid and 0 for pore). The top row shows grayscale Berea sandstone
CT images (748 × 748 × 1234) segmented using Otsu’s thresholding [Otsu et al., 1975] with the commercial software
GeoDict [GmbH, 2025]. The three rightmost plane views display the segmented CT images from the middle of each
axis. The bottom row shows the blue epoxy-impregnated thin section (13776 × 8460), where the epoxy highlights the
pores. The thin-section image was segmented using a color-based thresholding approach in the hue-saturation-value
(HSV) color space, classifying blue regions as pores and other areas as solid [Liu et al., 2022]. The 3D CT data has a
relatively low resolution, with a voxel size of 8.02 µm, whereas the voxel size of the thin-section image is 0.65 µm. To
enable cross-correlation analysis, the thin-section image was downsampled by a factor of 0.65/8.02, aligning its voxel
size with that of the CT image and ensuring a consistent spatial resolution between the two datasets. To achieve this, we
employed cubic spline interpolation, which preserves fine-scale pore structures and minimizes aliasing artifacts during
downsampling.

(solid (1) and pore (0)). (Top row) The original grayscale CT scan, its segmented binary version, and extracted middle
slices along the xy-, yz-, and xz-planes. (Bottom row) The original thin-section image, its segmented binary version,
and pixel size adjustment from 0.65 µm to 8.02 µm
Since the exact location of the thin section was unknown (i.e., no ground truth), we defined the optimization parameter
bounds based on observations of both images. In particular, we specified the x- and y-rotation angle bounds to (−3, 3)
degrees, the z-rotation angle bounds to (0, 10) degrees, and the section number range to 1/4 −3/4 of the cubic size.
