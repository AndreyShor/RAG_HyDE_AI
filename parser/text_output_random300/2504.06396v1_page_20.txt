Statistics-based approach. The study in [19] conducted a comparative analysis of their
statistics-based topology against two established graph-generation models: Havel-Hakimi and
Chung-Lu [29]. In alignment with their methodology, these models are also employed as benchmarks
for evaluating the statistics-based topology across two test cases involving 50-bus and 500-bus
networks, as shown in Fig. 25 and 26. The graphical representations illustrate that the proposed
topology achieves reduced average path lengths due to enhanced node interconnectivity. This
comparison is quantified in Table 7, which details the network metrics for both 50 and 500 node
cases. Notably, the benefits of the proposed topology, characterized by decreased network delays
and increased routing flexibility, become more pronounced as the network size expands. These
results underscore the superiority of the proposed statistics-based topology in representing cyber-
networks.
The Chung-Lu algorithm generates random graphs that align with a given expected degree
sequence, making it particularly relevant for power grids where nodes—such as substations, genera-
tors, or loads—exhibit specific connectivity patterns. These patterns must be precisely replicated in
synthetic networks to accurately simulate real-world behaviors. The Chung-Lu model simplifies the
creation of graphs by connecting nodes randomly, with the connection probability between any two
nodes being proportional to the product of their expected degrees. In contrast, the Havel-Hakimi
algorithm is employed to produce graphs that exactly match a specified degree sequence. This
accuracy is crucial for power grids, where the exact number of connections per node is essential
for maintaining system realism.
However, these algorithms do not account for clustering, community structure, or other higher-
order network properties typical of real-world networks, such as those found in power grid utilities.
Graphs generated with a random structure may be adequate for analyzing smaller networks but
do not accurately reflect the geographical or functional constraints of actual large-scale power
systems. Consequently, our proposed statistics-based topology introduces real-world utility-based
metrics to capture the complexities of power grid networks accurately.

Conclusions
Realistic high-fidelity cyber-physical system models are important for understanding and improving
the security of large-scale electric power systems. Machine readable and simulation/emulation-
capable complete models can greatly enhance capabilities for defense of critical infrastructures, by
improving coordinated engineering assessments of the system leading to heightened situational
awareness and decision-making at all stages of an event life cycle. This is crucial for promoting
