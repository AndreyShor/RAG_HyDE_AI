& Automation Explorer interface. A Python-based real-time processing algorithm running on the
PC applied set the delay and gain parameters to the acquired signal. The processed signal was then
converted back to an analog form using a analog output (model NI 9263) at a sampling rate of 2000
Hz as well and delivered to a piercing solenoid, which generated the feedback magnetic field.
Sample preparation
Samples were prepared in a nitrogen-atmosphere and transferred into a spherical NMR tube (outer
diameter = 10.5 mm, inner diameter = 8.5 mm) (36) that can be adapted to the pH2 gas-handling
setup. Samples were prepared of a common Ir-precursor [Ir(IMes)(COD)Cl] dissolved in acetonitrile
or methanol, c.f. detailed sample composition is provided in Table S1. Following substrates and
solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification: (A) acetonitrile
(0.36 % [15N]-ACN and 99.64 % [14N]-ACN), (B) 1 % [2-13C,15N]-ACN in 99 % [14N]-ACN, and
(C) 1% [1-13C,15N]-ACN in 99 % [14N]-ACN; (D)[15N]-pyridine, (E) [15N2]-imidazole, (F)[15N3]-
metronidazole, (G)4-amino[15N]-pyridine, (H)[1-13C]-pyruvate, and(I)[U-13C, 15N]-butyronitrile,
c.f. Figure 3. An additional co-substrate was introduced to stabilize hyperpolarization transfer
efficiency of samples (A,B,C,H, and I), which are listed in Table S1.
The algorithm below implements real-time processing which adds the programmable feedback
delay (𝜏) and gain (𝐺ext) to the feedback field (𝐵ext) by continuously looping through these steps:
Theory of 𝐽-oscillators
The master equation.
The dynamics of the 𝐽-oscillator signal can be simulated using a master
equation:
𝑑
𝑑𝑡ˆ𝜌(𝑡) = −𝑖[ ˆ𝐻0 + ˆ𝑉(𝑡), ˆ𝜌(𝑡)] + ˆˆ𝑅ˆ𝜌(𝑡) + ˆ𝑃,
(S1)
where ˆ𝜌(𝑡) is the density operator, ˆ𝐻0 represents the 𝐽-coupling interaction, ˆ𝑉(𝑡) represent the
coupling of the molecule with the feedback loop, ˆˆ𝑅is the relaxation superoperator, ˆ𝑃accounts for
the SABRE hyperpolarization pumping.
Coherent Hamiltonian:
The 𝐽-coupling interaction Hamiltonian for the [15N]-ACN maser sys-
tem is:
ˆ𝐻0 = 2𝜋𝐽( ˆS · ˆK),
