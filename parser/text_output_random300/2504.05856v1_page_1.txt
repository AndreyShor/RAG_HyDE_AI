ABSTRACT
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the thermonuclear explosions of C/O white dwarf stars in binary systems, are phenomena that remain
poorly understood. The complexity of their progenitor systems, explosion physics and intrinsic diversity poses not only challenges for
their understanding as astrophysical objects, but also for their standardization and use as cosmological probes. Near-infrared (NIR)
observations offer a promising avenue for studying the physics of SNe Ia and for reducing systematic uncertainties in distance estima-
tions, as they exhibit lower dust extinction and smaller dispersion in peak luminosity than optical bands. Here, Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) is applied to a sample of SNe Ia with well-sampled NIR (YJH-band) light curves to identify the dominant components
of their variability and constrain physical underlying properties. The theoretical models of Kasen (2006) are used for the physical in-
terpretation of the PCA components, where we found the 56Ni mass to describe the dominant variability. Other factors, such as mixing
and metallicity, were found to contribute significantly as well. However, some differences are found between the components of the
NIR bands which may be attributed to differences in the explosion aspects they each trace. Additionally, the PCA components are
compared to various light-curve parameters, identifying strong correlations between the first component in J and H bands (second
component in Y) and peak brightness in both the NIR and optical bands, particularly in the Y band. When applying PCA to NIR color
curves, we found interesting correlations with the host-galaxy mass, where SNe Ia with redder NIR colors are predominantly found in
less massive (potentially more metal-poor) galaxies. We also investigate the potential for improved standardization in the Y band by
incorporating PCA coefficients as correction parameters, leading to a reduction in the scatter of the intrinsic luminosity of SNe Ia. As
new NIR observations become available, our findings can be further tested, ultimately refining our understanding of SNe Ia physics
and enhancing their reliability as cosmological distance indicators.

1. Introduction
It has long been postulated that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) re-
sult from the thermonuclear explosions of carbon and oxygen
(C/O) white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems (e.g. Whelan &
Iben 1973; Iben & Tutukov 1984; Woosley et al. 1986). Al-
though some constraints have been drawn from observations of
nearby SNe Ia (Nugent et al. 2011), conclusive evidence on the
progenitor systems of these transients remains elusive. The bulk
population (i.e. omitting sub-types) of SNe Ia are well-known
for being relatively homogeneous in luminosity. In the optical,
brighter SNe Ia tend to have wider light curves (Pskovskii 1977;

Phillips 1993) and bluer colors (Tripp 1998) and vice-versa.
These correlations provide useful insights into some physical
properties of these objects. For instance, brighter SNe Ia also
produce more 56Ni mass (MNi), which can be related to higher
temperature, and therefore, bluer colors, longer diffusion time-
scales and also longer-lasting luminosity emission (e.g. Nugent
et al. 1995).
Although, the number of SNe Ia observed in the optical
has drastically increased in recent years, with surveys such as
Zwicky Transient Facility (Bellm et al. 2019; Masci et al. 2019;
Graham et al. 2019; Dekany et al. 2020), and in the near future
with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and
Time (Ivezi´c et al. 2019), these wavelengths only provide a lim-
