where P(i, j, k) represents the pressure at level k for a given latitude-longitude point (i, j). The terms Ak (hPa) and
Bk (dimensionless fraction) are reference coefficients defining the hybrid coordinate system, while P0 (1000.0 hPa) is
the reference pressure. The surface pressure, PS(i, j), varies across grid points and is used to determine the pressure
levels dynamically.
For a quantity S(z) that varies with height z, its mass-weighted vertical integral can be converted to a pressure level
integral using the hydrostatic equation:

where S represents the variable of interest at the midpoint of the (i, j, k)-the grid box, and g is the acceleration due to
gravity. We conduct similar corrections to [Sha et al., 2025a,b], except applied on sigma-hybrid pressure levels, we
repeat the derivation of those calculations below for completeness.

Global dry air mass conservation
The evolution of dry air mass within a given atmospheric column is determined by the divergence of the vertically
integrated dry air mass flux:

[(1 −q) v]dp

where v represents velocity, and q corresponds to total atmospheric moisture, approximated by specific total water (see
Table 1).
For a global sum, if the atmosphere is considered incompressible, the divergence term in equation (9) becomes zero.
Consequently, the total global dry air mass (⟨Md⟩) remains conserved over time (henceforth, ⟨⟩denotes a global sum):
∂
∂t⟨Md⟩= ∂

Where ϵd is the residual term that violates the global dry air mass conservation.
For two forecast time steps separated by ∆t = t1 −t0, where t0 corresponds to the initial analyzed state and t1 denotes
a subsequent validation time, equation (10) can be reformulated as:
∂
∂t⟨Md⟩= ⟨Md (t0)⟩−⟨Md (t1)⟩= ϵd
(11)
During the correction stage, PS can be adjusted to ensure ϵd = 0 using a multiplicative ratio. For this correction, the
contribution of global dry air mass from coefficients A and B are estimated as follows:
⟨MA⟩= SUM

Where ⟨MA⟩and ⟨MB⟩are global dry air mass components spread to A and B, respectively. When computed on t1,
they are denoted as ⟨MA (t1)⟩and ⟨MB (t1)⟩.
The correction of ps is defined as follows:
p∗
s (t1) = ps (t0) ⟨Md (t1)⟩−⟨MA (t1)⟩
⟨MB (t1)⟩
(13)
Where ⟨Md (t0)⟩is the total amount of global dry air mass calculated from the initial condition. p∗
s (t1) is the corrected
ps on t1. The same multiplicative correction is applied to ps on all grid cells.
