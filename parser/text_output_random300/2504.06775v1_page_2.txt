of useful algorithms potentially requiring hundreds of
thousands of qubits [34].
As a result, the theoretical and experimental imple-
mentation of QEC codes is still in its early stages and
is largely limited to the smallest codes or the simplest
operations. QEC codes have been successfully applied to
a small number of quantum operations in both theoreti-
cal and experimental quantum environments. In partic-
ular, the [[4,2,2]] stabiliser code has seen widespread use
in recent years across a range of applications, including
magic state preparation [35], quantum chemistry [36, 37],
Variational Quantum Eigensolvers [38–40], and the im-
plementation of diverse quantum circuits [41–43]. Codes
with enhanced error correction capabilities and greater
resource requirements, including the Steane code [44, 45],
repetition code [46], Shor code [47], Bacon-Shor code and
surface code, have primarily been applied to error cor-
rection on a single logical qubit [48–51] or to the imple-
mentation of simple operations on 1-2 logical qubits [52–
55], though notably the Steane Code was recently used
to logically encode three-qubit circuits for the quantum
Fourier Transform [56].
Despite these recent advance-
ments, no experiment or theoretical simulation has yet
demonstrated the application of a QEC code to a QML
problem.
We present the first study on the implementation of a
QML algorithm with a QEC code. Specifically, we im-
plement a simple Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC)
with the [[4,2,2]] stabiliser code. We selected the simplest
stabiliser code and QML algorithm in order to minimise
resource overhead in our experiments, which nevertheless
requires 20 qubits to implement five rounds of syndrome
extractions. In Sections II and III, we explain how we
logically encoded the VQC according to the [[4,2,2]] code,
introduce the noise models we used to simulate realistic
noisy environments, and detail the parameters used in
our simulations. We then present and discuss the results
of our analyses in Section IV, showing that a threshold
error rate for ancilla qubits exists, such that above this
threshold the QEC code is no longer capable of ensuring
good training accuracies and state fidelities.
We con-
clude in Section V with a discussion of the implications
of our findings for the practical implementation of QML
algorithms on NISQ and fully fault-tolerant systems.

EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP
We chose a very simple 2-qubit VQC for our experi-
ments (displayed in Figure 1), in order to minimise both
resource overhead and computational time required to
run the simulations. The VQC takes two qubits encoded
in the basis encoding as input, and classifies their par-
ity through measurement of the first qubit in the Z basis.
The quantity measured is the expectation value over 1000
shots. We use only one rotational parameter, θ, to train
the classifier, as any more than one leads to overfitting.
The classifier is able to reach an accuracy of 1.0 within
100 training iterations.

Logical Encoding
We chose the [[4,2,2]] 4-qubit Calderbank-Shor-Steane
(CSS) stabiliser code for our encoding and error detec-
tion, as it is the simplest stabiliser code that protects
against X and Z single-qubit errors [57]. It encodes 2
logical qubits using 4 physical qubits, and can only fa-
cilitate detection (not correction) of single-qubit errors.
As with all stabiliser codes, errors are detected by taking
measurements of ancilla qubits after applying stabilisers
to the physical qubits, known as syndrome extraction.
We used the following mapping to encode 2 logical
qubits with 4 physical qubits:
|00⟩L =
1
√
2(|0000⟩+ |1111⟩)
(1)
|01⟩L =
1
√
2(|0011⟩+ |1100⟩)
(2)
|10⟩L =
1
√
2(|0101⟩+ |1010⟩)
(3)
|11⟩L =
1
√
2(|0110⟩+ |1001⟩),
(4)
where the left-hand side represents the four different 2-
logical qubit states (indicated by the subscript L), and
the right-hand side represents the physical qubit states.
With these definitions, the CNOT gate in the VQC is
logically encoded by a SWAP gate between the first two
physical qubits.
The logical encoding for the rotation
gates require additional ancilla qubits (one ancilla per
rotation gate to be encoded), where the ancilla qubits
undergo the rotation instead of the physical qubits. This
process generally requires a series of CNOT gates before
and after the application of each rotation gate, which
entangle the physical (and logical) qubits with the ancilla
qubits.
In our logical encoding, the quantum state of the full
qubit system, including ancilla qubits, is always of the
form:
|Ψ⟩=
3
X
i=0
ci |ψi⟩L
n−1
O
j=0
|ϕi⟩aj ,
(5)
where |ψi⟩L represents each of the four possible logical
basis states, ci is the complex coefficient associated with
the i-th logical basis state, |ϕi⟩aj represents the state of
the j-th ancilla qubit, aj, associated with the i-th logical
basis state, and n is the total number of ancilla qubits
that have been introduced into the system.
To illustrate, the full quantum state after the first two
RX rotations is given by:
|Ψ⟩= −ics |00⟩L |0⟩a1 |0⟩a2 + c2 |01⟩L |0⟩a1 |1⟩a2
−s2 |10⟩L |1⟩a1 |0⟩a2 −isc |11⟩L |1⟩a1 |1⟩a2 ,
