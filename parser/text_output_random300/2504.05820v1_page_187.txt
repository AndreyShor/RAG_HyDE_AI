An improved aN3LO P (3)
gq parametrization
Ref. [302] provides an additional number of moments of the N3LO splitting function P (3)
gq with
respect to the one available when the study of Ref. [3] was performed. This allows us to assess
the accuracy of our splitting function approximation by comparing results obtained by including
increasingly more information.
In order to illustrate this point, we show in Fig. A.1 how the P (3)
gq approximation obtained
with the method of Section 4.1.1 with 4, 5 or 10 Mellin moments are considered. As we
include further constraints, the uncertainty on the approximation becomes smaller and the
final parametrization contains fewer oscillations especially in the large-x region (right plot).
The methodology seems to estimate IHOU correctly with the more precise result within the
error band of the previous in most of the x-range. The reduction of IHOU is more prominent
for values x ≥10−4, with the small-x behavior quite unaffected by the presence of more
moments. This further suggest that our approximate N3LO splitting functions are only reliable
in a finite small-x region, while a precise determination of small-x splitting (and PDFs) requires
resummation techniques.

gq (x), together with
the corresponding IHOU estimate, in logarithmic (left) and linear (right) scale. We compare results
obtained with the full set of 10 available Mellin moments with those where the xP (3)
gq (x) parametrization
is constrained by a subset composed of only 4 or 5 moments.
