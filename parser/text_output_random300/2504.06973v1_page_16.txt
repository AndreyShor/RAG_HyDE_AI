Fig. 15: Period-eccentricity diagram for known post-mass transfer binaries. Recently discovered bloated stripped star binaries with
O/Be companions (Shenar et al. 2020; El-Badry & Quataert 2021; Villaseñor et al. 2023; Ramachandran et al. 2024; Pauli et al.
2022) are indicated with red diamond markers. These include the parameter values for HIP 15429 determined in this work (Müller-
Horn et al. 2025). Be + subdwarf binaries with known orbital parameters are shown with light blue triangles (Mourard et al. 2015;
Chojnowski et al. 2018; Peters et al. 2008, 2013; Klement et al. 2022, 2024; Wang et al. 2023). We plot the short-period subdwarf
binaries compiled by Edelmann et al. (2005) and Kupfer et al. (2015) and long-period (> 500 d orbits) subdwarf binaries discovered
by Deca et al. (2012); Barlow et al. (2013); Vos et al. (2012, 2013, 2017) with dark blue triangles. Likely post-common envelope
binaries with white dwarf or main sequence stars analysed by Yamaguchi et al. (2024) are shown with yellow stars.
As in the phase-dependent mass transfer scenario, it remains un-
clear why HIP 15429 exhibits higher eccentricity compared to
other binaries with similar periods and CBDs.
9.3. Inefficient tidal dissipation
An alternative explanation for the current eccentricity of
HIP 15429 is inefficient tidal dissipation, where rapid mass
transfer left insufficient time for full orbital circularisation. Evi-
dence from post-common envelope binaries, composed of main-
sequence stars with white dwarf companions (Yamaguchi et al.
2024, see also Fig. 15), and millisecond pulsars with massive
white dwarf companions (e.g., Lorimer et al. 2015), indicates
that systems with high mass loss rates often retain moderate to
high eccentricities, suggesting incomplete tidal circularisation
(Glanz & Perets 2021).
9.4. Kozai-Lidov Cycles
The presence of a third star in a hierarchical triple system can
significantly affect the evolution of a binary. Secular three-body
dynamics, specifically Lidov-Kozai cycles, can induce periodic
variations in the eccentricity and inclination of the inner and
outer orbits through angular momentum exchange (von Zeipel
1910; Kozai 1962; Lidov 1962; Harrington 1968). While the
semi-major axes remain constant due to the conserved orbital
energy, these cycles depend on the mutual inclination between
the orbits (Toonen et al. 2016). Initially derived for triples with
outer companions in circular orbits, the Kozai-Lidov effect was
later extended to eccentric outer orbits, where more chaotic dy-
namics may arise (see Naoz 2016, for a review on the eccentric
Kozai-Lidov effect).
Given that approximately 50% of B-type stars belong to
triple- or higher-order systems (Moe & Di Stefano 2017; Offner
et al. 2023), we investigated whether a triple system could ex-
plain the orbital eccentricity of HIP 15429. We used the Python
package rebound (Rein & Liu 2012) to simulate in a sim-
ple model the dynamical evolution of the B+Be binary, as-
suming a hierarchical triple configuration. We employed the
IAS15 integrator, which is well-suited for high-eccentricity or-
bits and ensures energy conservation to machine precision (Rein
& Spiegel 2015). The simulations varied the mass (0.1–5, M⊙,
log-uniformly spaced in 15 steps), period (10, 20, and 50 times
the inner period), and inclination (45–90◦in 5◦steps) of the
outer companion. The inner binary was initialised with param-
eters consistent with observations and circular orbits, assuming
tidal circularization during mass transfer. The outer orbit was
also assumed to be circular. The simulations covered 105 years,
which approximately corresponds to the estimated time since the
end of the mass transfer phase. The results indicate that a triple
system could excite the observed eccentricity, albeit with a low
likelihood. However, the limited parameter space explored, cau-
tions against strong conclusions.
In Fig. 16, the colour map shows the maximum eccentric-
ity achieved by the inner binary due to interaction with an outer
companion, as a function of the companion’s mass and inclina-
tion, with a fixed period ratio of 10 (Pout ≈2200 d). The white
dotted line marks where the inner binary’s eccentricity exceeds
