Brownian bridge above a curve

and so using the elementary inequality log(1 + s)/(1 + s) ≤e log(e + s)/(e + s) and the fact that the
expression on the right decreases for s ≥0, we get that
ζa,k(s) =

By using the above bound on ζa,k and recalling the exact expressions of the functions ρa,k and eρa,k,
the claims follow by some elementary calculations.

Lemma A.8. For a, k > 1, let ζa,k : R+

0 be the function defined in (A.17). There exists
a constant c = c(a) > 0 such that for all ι ∈(0, 1/8), b ≥1 sufficiently large, u ∈[bι, b3/4], all
s ∈(0, b/2], and all x ≥ζa,k(s),

so that the event in the lemma statement can be written as A0 ∩{Bs ≤x}. Using the Markov property
of the Brownian bridge, we note that

On the event {Bs ∈(−ζa,k(s), x]}, the above conditional probability is maximised when {Bs = x}.
Now, since s ∈(0, b/2] and x ≥ζa,k(s), Proposition A.5 and Lemma A.7 ensure that there exists a
constant c1 = c1(a) > 0 such that for all b ≥1 sufficiently large and u ∈[bι, b3/4], it holds that
P0,u,b(As|Bs = x) = Px,u,b−s

To conclude, it remains to estimate the probability of the event in the indicator function on the
right-hand side of (A.18). Since x ≥ζa,k(s), we observe that there exists a constant c2 > 0 such that
P0,u,b(−ζa,k(s) < Bs ≤x) ≤P0,u,b(|Bs| ≤x) ≤c2

Finally, putting everything together, we showed that there exist a constant c3 = c3(a) > 0 such that

and so the claim follows.
Proposition A.9. For a, k > 1, let ζa,k : R+

0 be the function defined in (A.17). There
exist constants c1 = c1(a), c2 = c2(a) > 0 such that for all ι ∈(0, 1/8), b ≥1 sufficiently large,
u ∈[bι, b3/4], and all s ∈(c2, b/2],
