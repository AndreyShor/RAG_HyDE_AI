Abstract
An important theoretical achievement of the last century was the realization that strict
renormalizability can be a powerful criterion to select Lagrangians in the framework of per-
turbative quantum field theory. The Standard Model Lagrangian (without gravity) is strictly
renormalizable from a perturbative point of view.
On the other hand, the inclusion of
gravity seems not to respect this criterion, since general relativity is perturbatively non-
renormalizable. The aim of this work is to provide concrete evidence that strict renormal-
izability is still a valid criterion even when applied to gravity. First, we show that adding
quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action gives rise to a strictly renormalizable
theory known as quadratic gravity. Second, we argue that this unique theory represents the
most conservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, is highly predictive, as
it can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in the sub-Planckian regime. In
particular, it provides one of the best fits to the CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation
and makes sharp cosmological predictions that can be tested in the near future. Finally, we
comment on the (super-)Planckian regime and conclude with a historical note.
