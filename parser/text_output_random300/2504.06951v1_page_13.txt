whose associated matrix-sequence has proven to have a GLT nature in Section 4 in Theorem 3.
We show the comparison between symbol hCW
0
(for u = 1), cf. (3.6), and the eigenvalues of ¯Hs
N. This
comparison is carried out using the concept of monotone rearrangement, which enables the interpretation
of the symbol as a single-variable function [4, Definition 2.1].
We notice that the agreement is very good, even for moderate matrix-sizes, which is nontrivial given the
asymptotic nature of the GLT distributional results. A further remarkable fact is that the range of the spec-
tral symbol hCW
0
contains all the spectra, i.e., no outliers are observed. Again, this is a highly nontrivial
matter and cannot be deduced directly from distributional results. In fact, the interplay between spectral lo-
calization and distributional properties is characteristic of linear positive operators (LPOs), such as Toeplitz
operators and various classes of variable-coefficient coercive differential operators (see [14, Corollary 6.2] for
the Toeplitz case and [23] for a broader discussion).
