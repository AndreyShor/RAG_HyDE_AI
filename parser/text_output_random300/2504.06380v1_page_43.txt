SI-Fig. 13: Rxx vs. ν at finite D: Rxx vs. filling factor, ν, at D = −0.30 V/nm and 0.67 V/nm values
for −2 < ν < 6 at a base temperature of 20 mK in absence of any magnetic field. The three solid circles
correspond to filling (ν) values: 2.1 ( ), 2.6 ( ), and 3.0 ( ) respectively.
(vacuum) permittivity. The thicknesses of the encapsulating top and bottom hBN layers are ∼28 nm and
∼30 nm, respectively.
Measured longitudinal resistance, Rxx, in SI-Fig. 13 for different D values show the tuning behavior
of the superconducting phase with D 11 between filling factor, ν(≡4n/ns) ≈2 −3.
