Figure 6. Top-left panel: Thresholds in terms of the peak value of ζ, i.e, µc = ζc(r = 0). The
green line µc,II separate the type-I region from the type-II region. Top-right panel: Threshold values
in terms of the value of the critical compaction function Cc at rm. The horizontal dashed red line
denotes the maximum threshold in the type-I region, where Cc(rm) = 2/3. Bottom-left panel: Critical
compaction function profile for the different shapes β.
Bottom-right panel: Critical overdensity

trace of the extrinsic curvature K as an auxiliary variable, we are able to simulate the type-II
region and identify the PBH formation threshold for β ≳2.5, bypassing the complications
associated with the neck structure R′ = 0. This results indicates that the threshold for PBH
formation, measured by Cc(rm), does not saturate to a constant value of 2/3 in the boundary
between the type-I/II regions, but instead decreases once the threshold is reached in the
type-II region.
In the bottom panels of Fig. 6, we show the corresponding profile for Cc and the crit-
ical over-density (δρ/ρb)c extrapolated to the time when ϵ = 1 (see Eq.(3.5)). When the
thresholds of PBH formation is found in the type-I region (Cc(rm) is a maximum), we know
from [67] that the profile dependence of the threshold for the compaction function is only
sensitive to its curvature (related with the dimensionless parametter q introduced in [67]
that accounts for the curvature at Cc(rm)) at the maximum. However, when the threshold is
found in the type-II region, Cc(rm) is no longer a local maximum, but rather a minimum. In
these cases, we observe that the curvature of Cc(rm) at the local minimum (rm) increases as β
increases, and the shape of C at rm is characterized by a spiky valley. By examining (δρ/ρb)c,
we see that these cases correspond to large derivatives at rm. This may indicate that the
