Nevertheless, to get all the elements of ( ⃗Q, ⃗P), one remains to geometrical reconstruct the FN twists {τab ≡eTab}a<b.
Each τab is given by the spinors on both Sa and Sb as well as the dihedral angle between the tetrahdera tetraa and
tetrab hinged by the triangle △ab shared by the two tetrahedra [9] (see also Appendix B of [11]):

depends on another two spinors ξac and ξad on another two cusps (not connected to Sb) of Sa based at ba and another
two spinors ξbe and ξbf another two cusps of Sb based at bb. Their relative positions are illustrated in fig.9. θab in
(54) is a non-geometrical parameter that depends on the boundary condition. When the FN twist is associated to an
internal triangle, θab = 0 when the 4-manifold under consideration is globally time-oriented [11, 26].

Coordinate reconstruction on S3\Γ5
Another way to reconstruct the Chern-Simons phase space coordinates is to first construct the coordinates (⃗Φ, ⃗Π)
used to define Z× (34), which are the coordinates on ideal octahedra, then use (36) to symplectic transform to ( ⃗Q, ⃗P).
Moreover, since there are only 10 cusps on ∂(S3\Γ5), the collection of all spinors calculated from the local frame of
each of the five tetrahedra contributes some redundant data. In this subsection, we will fix 10 spinors out of this
collection to reconstruct the elements of (⃗Φ, ⃗Π) used to define Z×.
Let us fix the single base point b of S3\Γ5 to be the base point b2 on S2, i.e. on the edge connecting cusp 2 and 3
(r.f. fig.7). Then we need to parallel transport the spinors {ξab} defined at ba for a ̸= 2 to b using the frame-changing
holonomy G2a defined in (21). Firstly, we focus on the ideal tetrahedron ∆x(1) in the ideal octahedron Oct(1) dressed
by FG coordinates x1, x′
1 and x′′
1 (r.f. fig.5b). As can be seen from fig.10, three out of four cusp boundaries of ∆x(1)
are on the annuli connected to holes of S2 while the remaining one is on the annulus connecting S3 and S5. We define
ξ35 at b3 then use G23 that passes along annulus (23) to parallel transport it to b. Then x1 is expressed in terms of
the framing flags s1 = G23ξ35, s2 = ξ23, s3 = ξ25, s4 = ξ24
x1 = ⟨G23ξ35 ∧ξ23⟩⟨ξ25 ∧ξ24⟩
⟨G23ξ35 ∧ξ25⟩⟨ξ23 ∧ξ24⟩.

Similarly,
x′
1 = ⟨ξ23 ∧ξ24⟩⟨ξ25 ∧G23ξ35⟩
⟨ξ23 ∧ξ25⟩⟨ξ24 ∧G23ξ35⟩,
