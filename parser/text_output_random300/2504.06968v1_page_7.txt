jcmiEline/(4ElineΓedζi), approximately 1026 g. Here, Eline is the observed isotropic
total energy of the emission line, Γe is the total excitation rate for an electron of the high-Z ion
transitioned from the ground in the lab frame, mi is the mass of the high-Z ion (i.e., the copper),
and ζi = 0.1 means the mass fraction capable of producing emission lines relative to the mass
of all nuclei entrained in the GRB jet 48. We find the kinetic energy of heavy nuclei in the jet is
about 3 × 1049 erg, which is much larger than the energy budget of the observed emission line,
approximately 3 × 1048 erg.
