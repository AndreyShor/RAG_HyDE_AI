Proof. The proof of the direct part (achievability of the rate) is as follows.
Let Λ1 : A →BK be the optimal
CPTP map in Deﬁnition 3 at γ = 0. Let UΛ1 : A →BKE be the corresponding Stinespring dilation isometry of
Λ1 : A →BK. Alice applies UΛ1 to each copy of the state ρAR. Then, the overall puriﬁed state is
|τ1⟩BKERR′
= (UΛ1 ⊗11RR′) |ρ⟩ARR′
,
where |ρ⟩ARR′
is a puriﬁcation of ρAR, and R and R′ are inaccessible reference systems. Note that by deﬁnition
Tr ER′τ1BKERR′ = τBKR. Then Alice and Bob apply QSR to n copies of the pure state τBKERR′
1
to send system Bn
from Alice to Bob with systems KnEn as the side information systems of Alice. The rate of this protocol is equal
to a(ρ, 0) = 1
2I(B : RR′)τ1 + ηn. After implementing this protocol, the state shared by Alice and Bob is ǫn close
to (|τ1⟩BKERR′
)⊗n. Tracing out systems EnR′n only increases the ﬁdelity, hence, this protocol achieves the rate of
a(ρ, 0) = 1
2I(B : RR′)τ1 + ηn and preserves the 1 −ǫn ﬁdelity with the state (τ BKR)⊗n. By Theorem 15, ηn and ǫn
vanish as n grows very large.
In the following, we obtain the converse bound. For any protocol with block length n and error ǫ
S(M)ν + S(B0)Φ ≥S(MB0)ν
= S(BnWBB1)ξ
≥S(BnWB)ξ + S(B1)ξ −nδ(n, ǫ)
≥S(BnWB)ξ + S(B1)Φ −nδ(n, ǫ) −nδ1(n, ǫ),

where the second line is due to applying the decoding isometry. The third line follows from Lemma 2. The last line
follows from the decodability: the output state on system B1 is 2

then the inequality follows by applying the Fannes-Audenaert inequality, where δ1(n, ǫ) = 1

From the above, we obtain
nQ(n, ǫ) + nE(n, ǫ) = S(M)ν + S(B0)Φ −S(B1)Φ
≥S(BnWB)ξ −nδ(n, ǫ) −nδ1(n, ǫ),
(6)
where nE(n, ǫ) = S(B0)Φ −S(B1)Φ. Moreover, we obtain the following
S(M)ν ≥S(M|KnWAA1)ν
= S(MKnWAA1)ν −S(KnWAA1)ν
= S(AnA0)ρ⊗Φ −S(KnWAA1)ν
= S(An)ρ + S(A0)Φ −S(KnWAA1)ν
= S(RnR′n)ρ + S(A0)Φ −S(KnWAA1)ν
= S(RnR′n)ρ + S(A0)Φ −S(BnWBRnR′nB1)ξ
≥S(RnR′n)ρ + S(A0)Φ −S(BnWBRnR′n)ξ −S(B1)ξ
≥S(RnR′n)ρ + S(A0)Φ −S(BnWBRnR′n)ξ −S(B1)Φ −nδ1(n, ǫ),
where the third line is due to the deﬁnition of the encoding isometry. The ﬁfth and sixth lines follow since the states
|ρ⟩ARR′
and |ξn⟩BnKnWAWBRnR′nA1B1 are pure. The penultimate line follows from subadditivity of entropy. The last
line follows from the decodability: the output state on system B1 is 2
