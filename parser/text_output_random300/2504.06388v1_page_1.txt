Abstract.
We present a method for accurately computing transition probabili-
ties in one-dimensional photoionization problems. Our approach involves solving
the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation and projecting its solution onto scat-
tering states that satisfy the correct incoming or outgoing boundary conditions.
Conventionally, the photoelectron emission spectrum is obtained by projecting the
time-evolved wavefunction onto the stationary continuum eigenstates of the un-
perturbed, time-independent Hamiltonian. However, when the spatial potential
is symmetric, both the initial bound state and the ﬁnal continuum states exhibit
well-deﬁned parity. The propagated wavefunction retains structural features of
the initial bound state, including its parity. As a result, changes in the parity
of the continuum states can introduce substantial variations in the projections,
leading to spurious oscillations in the computed electron emission spectrum. Our
method circumvents this issue by employing scattering states without deﬁned
parity. Furthermore, it enables the calculation of directional emission, making
it possible to study emission asymmetries. To illustrate the capabilities of our
scattering projection method, we analyze the partial diﬀerential photoionization
probabilities of Al(111) metallic surfaces under short laser pulses at grazing inci-
dence.
