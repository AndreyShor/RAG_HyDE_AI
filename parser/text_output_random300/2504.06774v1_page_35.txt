Figure 19: Comparison of the predicted temporal evolution of streamwise velocity com-

all LSTM architectures. Although general error trends remain centered around zero, in-
creased spread indicates higher variability in the predictions. The error distributions for
SVD tend to show slight asymmetry, particularly in the streamwise and normal com-
ponents, suggesting that SVD struggles more with capturing complex flow structures
compared to HOSVD. Even among the SVD models, the LSTM 2 dense architecture
shows the best results for UQ, with sharper peaks and relatively narrower distributions
compared to the corresponding architectures, indicating better performance.

Case: Turbulent Flow Past a Circular Cylinder
This final data set poses several challenges typical of experimental data. Turbulent flows,
inherently chaotic and multi-scale, are difficult to predict accurately, especially with added
