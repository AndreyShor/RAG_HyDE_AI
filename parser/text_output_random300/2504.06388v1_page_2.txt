Elimination of spurious oscillations on photoemission spectra

1. Introduction
Many ionization experiments aimed at obtaining energy spectra and cross sections
are performed under quasi-stationary conditions. Consequently, quantum mechanics
and scattering theory have traditionally focused on solutions of the time-independent
Schr¨odinger equation, primarily because stationary scattering states form a basis that
facilitates the analysis of time-dependent collisions. However, recent breakthroughs
in laser technology—particularly the advent of attosecond pulses, a key achievement
recognized by the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics [1]—have sparked growing interest in
ultrashort laser pulses as ionizing sources. As a result, theoretical approaches must
adapt to these developments by placing greater emphasis on the temporal description
of physical processes.
The calculation of photoionization spectra has been an active area of research
for several decades, encompassing a wide variety of targets, including atoms [2–5],
molecules [6–8], and solids [9–11]. In many cases—such as electron emission from solid
surfaces—the underlying physics can be eﬀectively described using one-dimensional
models [12, 13]. For instance, photoemission from the valence band has been studied
for metallic surfaces like Al(111), Al(100), Be(0001), and Mg(0001) [12, 13].
Following previous studies [12–15], photoelectron spectra are commonly obtained
by numerically solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) and
projecting the ﬁnal wavefunction onto the stationary continuum eigenstates of the
unperturbed time-independent Hamiltonian. However, this approach often yields large
unphysical oscillations in the energy spectrum [12, 14]. To mitigate these artifacts,
convolution techniques such as the widely used window-operator method (WOM)
[16, 17] are typically employed.
Nevertheless, we have found that these methods
can inadvertently suppress physically meaningful structures in the spectrum.
In this work, we restrict our study to one-dimensional ionization processes and
perform a detailed analysis of electron emission from symmetric potentials.
To
overcome the aforementioned spurious oscillations, we introduce a computational
method that projects the wavefunction—evaluated at the end of the laser pulse—onto
scattering states with the appropriate incoming or outgoing boundary conditions. Our
Scattering Projection Method (SPM) not only eliminates the unphysical oscillations
more eﬀectively than the WOM but also preserves ﬁne structures of physical relevance,
such as Ramsauer-Townsend-type oscillations, which are otherwise suppressed by the
WOM.
We investigate the ionization of a one-electron system subjected to an external
electric ﬁeld, modeled as either a traveling wave (short laser pulse) or a standing wave
(half-cycle pulse). We begin with a simple square well potential supporting a single
bound state, then proceed to the jellium model [14] as a ﬁrst approximation of a
metallic surface, and ﬁnally apply a more sophisticated band-structure-based (BSB)
potential for Al(111), which incorporates surface roughness due to atomic layering as
well as surface plasmon eﬀects [13, 18].
This article is organized as follows.
In Sec.
2, we describe the numerical
methods used to solve the TDSE for electron ionization in a one-dimensional
potential, and we detail two approaches to extract the energy spectrum: (i) projection
onto standard stationary continuum eigenstates of the time-independent Schr¨odinger
equation (TISE), and (ii) the proposed SPM using scattering states. A step-by-step
numerical procedure is provided in the Appendix. In Sec. 3, we present and compare
