the same equation as Eq. (3.46) in [35]. To linearize the equation to second order with respect to
two parameters ϵ1, ϵ2, we expand the solution ρ(θ, ϕ) as
ρ(θ, ϕ) = ρ0 + ϵ1u1(θ, ϕ) + ϵ2u2(θ, ϕ) + 1
2(ϵ2
1v1(θ, ϕ) + ϵ2
2v2(θ, ϕ) + 2ϵ1ϵ2w(θ, ϕ)) + O(ϵ3),
(B.1)
and plug it into the minimal surface equation. The first linearized minimal surface equation becomes
sin2 θ∂2u
∂θ2 + ∂2u
∂ϕ2 + tan θ (sin2 θ + 1)∂u
∂θ = 0 .
(B.2)
The equation is the same for both u1 and u2 so we dropped the subscript for simplicity. Using a
separation of variables ansatz u(θ, ϕ) = Θ(θ)Φ(ϕ), we obtain
sin2 θ Θ′′(θ)Φ(ϕ) + Θ(θ)Φ′′(ϕ) + tan θ (sin2 θ + 1)Θ′(θ)Φ(ϕ) = 0 ,
(B.3)
which we can write as
sin2 θ Θ′′(θ)
Θ(θ) + tan θ (sin2 θ + 1)Θ′(θ)
Θ(θ) + Φ′′(ϕ)
Φ(ϕ) = 0 .
(B.4)
This holds only if
Φ′′(ϕ) = −l2Φ(ϕ)
(B.5)
sin2 θ Θ′′(θ) + tan θ (sin2 θ + 1)Θ′(θ) = l2Θ(θ) ,
(B.6)
where l is, in general, real or imaginary. However, a negative separation constant would break the
2π periodicity of u(θ, ·) so we can focus on the case l ∈R. The ODEs are then solved by
Φ(ϕ) = A1 sin lϕ + A2 cos lϕ
(B.7)
Θ(θ) = B1(1 + lc) tanl(θ/2) + B2(1 −lc) tan−l(θ/2) .
(B.8)
The second linearization of the minimal surface equation with respect to one parameter and a family
of solutions thereof are given in Eqs. (3.49) and (3.53) in [35]. Here however we are interested in
two-parameter linearization, in which case picking the coefficient of the ϵ1ϵ2 term in the minimal
surface equation yields
sin2 θ∂2w
∂θ2 + ∂2w
∂ϕ2 + tan θ (sin2 θ + 1)∂w
∂θ = 2
ρ0

sin2 θ∂u1
∂θ
∂u2
∂θ + ∂u1
∂ϕ
∂u2
∂ϕ

.
(B.9)
Here u1 and u2 are arbitrary first-order solutions that act as a source for the second-order solu-
tion. Notice that this could also be obtained from the one-parameter second linearization by the
polarization formula. Indeed, if we denote by W[u] as the second order linearization of
ρ(θ, ϕ) = ρ0 + ϵu(θ, ϕ) + ϵ2
2 v(θ, ϕ) + O(ϵ3) ,
(B.10)
then the w(θ, ϕ) in (B.1) satisfies
w(θ, ϕ) = 1
4 (W(u1 + u2) −W(u1 −u2)) .
(B.11)
