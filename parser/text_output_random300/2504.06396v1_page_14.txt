These metrics give us insights into the size of the network, the distance between nodes, and the
performance of the network in terms of latency. These are critical for SCADA systems, for which
an important requirement is response time. When a utility control center sends a command to a
substation, the control center should receive a confirmation of the command or a measurement
within a very short delay, in the order of milliseconds. Inside a substation, for example, the com-
munication latency requirements are documented in the IEC 61850 protocol, as presented in [15].
While 1𝑠𝑒𝑐is an acceptable delay for an alarm, the delay for mission critical commands and data
is between 3 −10𝑚𝑠𝑒𝑐[11]. Hence these models and metrics can help inform grid planning and
cybersecurity measures
