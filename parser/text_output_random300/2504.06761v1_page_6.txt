ensuring a smooth transition of hairpin vortex heights across different vortex packet levels.
In this configuration, the hairpin vortices collectively form an inclined hairpin ramp from
upstream to downstream, with a growth angle reaching up to 𝛾≈12◦, consistent with
experimental observations (Adrian et al. 2000). The circulation of each hairpin vortex is
given by
Γ( 𝑗)
𝑖
= 𝐶Γ𝑢𝜏ℎ𝑖,
(2.10)
where 𝐶Γ = 2 is the circulation coefficient and 𝑢𝜏= 𝜈Re𝜏/𝛿represents the friction velocity.
A key advantage of constructing wall turbulence based on vortex building blocks is
the flexibility to phenomenologically adjust the spatial arrangement of hairpin vortices
to incorporate theoretical results and experimental/numerical observations. Considering
the meandering features of large-scale structures in turbulent boundary layers (Hutchins
& Marusic 2007), we introduce the spanwise meandering of hairpin vortex packets (see
figure 2(b)). Each hairpin vortex within a level-𝑖packet undergoes a random spanwise
displacement
Δ𝑧𝑖= 𝜎𝑚𝜉ℎ𝑖,
𝜉∼𝒰(−1, 1),
(2.11)
where 𝜎𝑚= 0.5 is a constant, and 𝜉is a uniform random variable in the range (−1, 1),
in agreement with experimental (Hutchins & Marusic 2007) and numerical (Adrian & Liu
2002; Hwang & Lee 2022) observations.
In addition to these self-similar wall-attached eddies, we incorporate wall-coherent
superstructures within the largest vortex packets, also referred to as very large-scale motions
(VLSMs) (Kim & Adrian 1999; Chandran et al. 2020), to account for the dynamics of the
outer layer. Building on the concept that vortex packets align in the streamwise direction to
form extended structures, we model these superstructures by combining two of the largest
packets. Their height is set to match the boundary layer height, ℎ𝑆𝑆= 𝛿, ensuring consistency
with the overall flow organization, as illustrated in figure 2(c). Furthermore, the circulation
of each hairpin vortex within VLSMs is prescribed as Γ𝑆𝑆= 0.1 ¯𝑈ℎ𝑆𝑆, where the velocity
scale is chosen as the bulk velocity ¯𝑈rather than the friction velocity 𝑢𝜏used for self-similar
wall-attached vortex packets. These superstructures span the entire boundary layer height
