From these values we calculated the IMFPs and EALs as functions of 𝐸𝑘𝑖𝑛 for SnTe and SnO (Figure S4). For spin-orbit 
split peaks, the average 𝐸𝑘𝑖𝑛 was used, weighted by the respective intensity ratio (1:2 for p-orbitals and 2:3 for d-
orbitals). Table S5 shows the results.

There has been an extensive debate regarding the accuracy of different experimental and theoretical approaches used 
to determine the IMFP and EAL. While various methods lead to some degree of quantitative uncertainty, experimental 
and theoretical results have generally shown reasonable agreement.[7] The calculations presented here do not aim to 
contribute to this nuanced debate or challenge findings from more detailed studies that may already exist.
