corresponding to broadband stations(BH, HH), particu-
larly have a wide range of samplers per second compared
with other kinds of stations, such as the long period ones
(LH); however, to uniform the data, we resample the data
to 4 samples per second.
As before, we transform the records into physics sig-
nals: displacement, velocity, and acceleration. We filter
the data between 1 and 15 Hz, which allows the inclu-
sion of seismic human noise (4–14 Hz), microseismicity,
and environmental noise (more than 1 Hz) [e.g., 54, 55].
Then, we will have three files for each station contain-
ing the displacement, velocity, and acceleration. See Ap-
pendix A 2 for more technical details.

METHODS
This section discusses both the theoretical aspects of
quality estimation for a weak source of randomness and
the practical approach derived from these considerations.
Section IV A begins with the formal definition of the ϵ-
SV-source (see Eq. (1)) and demonstrates why we can-
not directly apply it to randomness estimation for fi-
nite sequences. Next, Section IV B introduces the cor-
rect method for estimating ϵh (epsilons for fixed history
length), which plays a key role in defining the ϵ-SV-
source.
Section IV C then presents a general function
for combining a sequence of ϵh values into a single ϵ
value. Following this, Section IV D outlines a set of ax-
ioms that a reasonable ϵ-estimating function should sat-
isfy to replace the formal ϵ-SV-source formula effectively.
Section IV E explores several examples of such functions
and identifies the most suitable one for our scenario. Fi-
nally, Section IV F covers possible discretization meth-
ods, which represent the final mandatory step of data
preprocessing.
A.
Formal definition
Let us start by recalling the definition of ϵ-SV-Source
already introduced in Eq. (1).
Definition IV.1 (ϵ-Santha-Vazirani-Source). We say
that the source S (that produces some binary sequence
s1, s2, . . .) is ϵ-Santha-Vazirani-Source if we have that
∀
n∈N
∀
s0,...,sn+1∈{0,1}
1
2 −ϵ ≤P(Sn+1 = sn+1|Sn = sn, . . . , S0 = s0, E) ≤1
2 + ϵ
(2)
where E represents all other random variables in the past
light cone of Sn+1.
Then for ϵ = 0 we obtain a fully random source, and
for ϵ = 1/2 the source can even be deterministic.
We will begin by modifying the definition so that there
will be a separate inequality for each history length. The
first step would be to remove the global variable E since
it is not part of the generated sequence and cannot be
statistically checked in any way. We can do this since
we assume that the source is of the ϵ-SV Source form.
We should point out that this assumption is reasonable
since it is unlikely that the adversary could influence the
seismic signals, especially the one from the strong earth-
quake with an epicenter between 30 km and 1000 km
below the Earth’s surface.
Similarly, there is reasonable argumentation for taking
seismic noise as the ϵ-SV source. Detectors that collect
this kind of data are sensitive even to small ground vibra-
tions. On one hand, it is expected that in crowded areas,
the devices would detect and record more unpredictable
bits compared to the ones generated in remote places.
The detection of noise is the result of numerous vibra-
tion sources. This makes the control and the influence
on the device by the adversary unattainable in practice.
It gives us inequality in a much simpler form.
∀
n∈N
∀
s0,...,sn+1∈{0,1}
1
2 −ϵ ≤P(Sn+1 = sn+1|Sn = sn, . . . , S0 = s0) ≤1
2 + ϵ.
(3)
We can then further transform the inequality in the fol-
lowing way.
∀
n∈N
max
s0,...,sn+1∈{0,1}
P(Sn+1 = sn+1|Sn = sn, . . . , S0 = s0) −1
2
 ≤ϵ.
(4)
We should also comment here that if some source is ϵ-SV-
Source then it is also ϵ′-SV-Source for all ϵ′ > ϵ. Since
we are interested in the smallest value of ϵ anyway, we
can assume that the value is optimal from the beginning.
Therefore, we will use the same ϵ variable name in the
equation below to not abuse the notation. Then, we can
rewrite it to obtain epsilon as a supremum over all pos-
sible n values.
ϵ = sup
n∈N
max
s0,...,sn+1∈{0,1}
P(Sn+1 = sn+1|Sn = sn, . . . , S0 = s0) −1
2
 .
(5)
Since our estimation will need constant history lengths at
some point, we can rewrite the formula in the following
way.
ϵ ≤sup
n∈N
max
h∈{0,...,n}
max
sn−h+1,...,sn+1∈{0,1}
P(Sn+1 = sn+1|Sn = sn, . . . , Sn−h+1 = sn−h+1) −1
2
 .
(6)
The above inequality is true since we add maximization
over a whole set of histories rather than a single one. We
