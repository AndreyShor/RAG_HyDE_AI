renormalons lack any semi-classical interpretation that drives the factorial (n!) divergence in
renormalized perturbation theory [29].
Loop finiteness.
The appearance of the function r in (29) renders loop integrals finite, creating
a perturbatively finite theory. Consider the 4-point correlator in the ϕ4 model with interaction
Lagrangian λ
4!ϕ4—the so-called ”fish-diagram.” This becomes finite due to the suppression from
r at high momentum. Since r(p) ≈1 for p ≪M while providing exponential suppression
for p > M, the integral behaves as log(p2/µ2
0) for p ≪M, and as M 2/p2 exp(−p2/M 2).
Consequently, the one-loop running becomes:





λ(µ) ≃λ(µ0) + (1 + λ(µ0)β1 log(µ2/µ2
0))
µ < M
λ(µ) ≃λ(M)

1 −λ(M)β1

µ ≥M ,
(41)
where the usual one-loop factor is β1 = 3/(16π2). The first line of (41) shows standard running;
the second reveals that the coupling quickly reaches an asymptotic constant value for µ ≥M.
In summary, any loop constructed in the model becomes finite, and no Landau pole exists
due to (41).
We should also examine modifications to on-shell processes, such as 2 →2 scattering. At
leading order in λ expansion, we have:
⟨f|S(1)|i⟩= ⟨1p, 1p′|(−i λ) ϕ−(x)ϕ−(x)ϕ+(x)ϕ+(x)|1k, 1k′⟩=
1
(2π)8(−i λ) δ(4)(p + p′ −k −k′)
p
r(p) r(p′) r(k) r(k′)
p
(2ω⃗p) (2ω⃗p′) (2ω⃗k) (2ω⃗k′) .
(42)
The superscripts −and + denote the creation and destruction operator parts of the field. The
standard result is modified only by the factors r in (42). Given the form of the function r in (30),
the part in p2 becomes trivial onshell, p2 = m2, while the part in pµvµ produces an anisotropy.
Some momentum directions may be enhanced, depending on the constant four-vector v. Of
course, all these modifications are suppressed at energies much lower than M.
Absence of the UV renormalons.
We have discussed the perturbative finiteness of the theory
above, now let us consider what to expect at the non-perturbative level. Renormalons [29, 30]
can be interpreted as a bridge between perturbative and non-perturbative physics. The singu-
larities in the Borel transform due to renormalons lie on the semi-positive axis and hamper any
Borel-Laplace resummation. They are not related to any semi-classical expansion and are con-
sidered genuine non-perturbative objects related to renormalization [30]. In the literature, their
presence represents a failure of the perturbative renormalization procedure since the resulting
series cannot be resummed without ambiguities [29].
