Proof of Lemma 7.2
In this subsection, we prove Lemma 7.2 by reducing the joint Laplace transform of µγ,t to a more
manageable quantity through a series of reduction steps, following the strategy developed in [MRV16]
with some non-trivial modifications. To streamline this process, we introduce some shorthand
notations. We fix for the reminder of this section R ≥1. For a function χ : [0, R]d →R, we introduce
the sequence of measures (µχ
γ,t)t≥0 on Rd defined as follows,
µχ
γ,t(dx)
def= e−γχ(x)µγ,t(dx) ,
where we recall that µγ,t is the regularised and normalised supercritical GMC measure as defined in
(1.9). For t > 0 and a function χ : Rd →R, we introduce the fields Yt and Yχ
t on Rd, as well as the
constant dt by setting
Yt(x)
def= Xt(x) −
√
2dt ,
Yχ
t (x)
def= Yt(x) −χ(x) ,
dt
def= −

log t ,
(7.13)
so that the measure µχ
γ,t introduced above can be written as
µχ
γ,t(dx) = eγ(Yχ
t (x)−dt)+dtdx .
For λ > 0, recalling the definition (6.1) of the random function Fγ,t and the notation introduced in
(3.2), only for this section, we let

(7.14)
and for a subset D ⊆[0, R]d, we use GD to denote the same quantity as above, but with [0, R]d
replaced by D. With this notation in hand, we note that we can write
E[1 −GR] = E

where here we used the fact that |Dλ
R| is almost surely positive.
7.2.1
High value constraint
We start with the following lemma, which essentially states that only the points where the field attains
sufficiently high values contribute to the integral on the right-hand side of (7.15).
Lemma 7.5. For any λ > 0 and ε > 0, there exists a constant A ≥0 sufficiently large such that for
any s ≥0 sufficiently large satisfying (es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N, there exists T ≥0 sufficiently large
such that for any t ≥T and χ : [0, R]d →R satisfying the conditions in (6.6), it holds that
E

(7.16)
Proof. We start by observing that on the event {m ∈Dλ
R, Yχ
t (m) −dt ≤−A}, it holds that
Yχ
t (x) −dt ≤−A + λ ,
∀x ∈[0, R]d .
Therefore, using this fact, we obtain that
