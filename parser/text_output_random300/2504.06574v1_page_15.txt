ˆbkx(k) + ˆck

x(k)2, where ˆbk and ˆck were the estimated coefficient values and x(k) was the standardised value of
the k-th parameter. We replaced ˆbk or ˆck by zero when it was not statistically significant with the significance
level of 0.1%. Parameter γ was omitted in Fig. 4 because neither coefficients were significant. In Supplementary
Table S1, we report the regression table showing the estimated coefficients and their standard errors. The table
also contains the results for the linear model, which is the case of ck ≡0 and dkl ≡0, and the square model
without interaction terms, which is the case of dkl ≡0. The full quadratic model [eq. (9)] was superior to the
linear and the square models in terms of adjusted R2, AIC, BIC, and F-test, as shown in Supplementary Table
S2.
