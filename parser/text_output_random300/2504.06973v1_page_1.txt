ABSTRACT
Interaction in close binary systems is common in massive stars. The mass donor is stripped of its hydrogen envelope and evolves to
become a hot helium star, whereas the accretor gains mass and angular momentum, spinning up in the process. However, the small
number of well-constrained post-interaction binary systems currently limits detailed comparisons with binary evolution models.
We identified a new post-interaction binary, HIP 15429, consisting of a stripped star and a recently formed, rapidly rotating Be star
companion (vrot sin i ≈270 km/s) sharing many similarities with recently identified bloated stripped stars.
From orbital fitting of multi-epoch radial velocities we find a 221-day period. We also find an eccentricity of e = 0.52, which
is unexpectedly high as tides are expected to have circularised the orbit efficiently during the presumed recent mass transfer. The
formation of a circumbinary disk during the mass transfer phase or the presence of an unseen tertiary companion might explain the
orbit’s high eccentricity.
We determined physical parameters for both stars by fitting the spectra of the disentangled binary components and multi-band pho-
tometry. The stripped nature of the donor star is affirmed by its high luminosity at a low inferred mass (≲1 M⊙) and imprints of
CNO-processed material in the surface abundances. The donor’s relatively large radius and cool temperature (Teff = 13.5 ± 0.5 kK)
suggest that it has only recently ceased mass transfer. Evolutionary models assuming a 5-6 M⊙progenitor can reproduce these param-
eters and imply that the binary is currently evolving towards a stage where the donor becomes a subdwarf orbiting a Be star.
The remarkably high eccentricity of HIP 15429 challenges standard tidal evolution models, suggesting either inefficient tidal dissipa-
tion or external influences, such as a tertiary companion or circumbinary disk. This underscores the need to identify and characterise
more post-mass transfer binaries to benchmark and refine theoretical models of binary evolution.

1. Introduction
Binary interactions play a crucial role in the evolution of mas-
sive stars. Most massive stars are found in binary systems (e.g.,
Kobulnicky & Fryer 2007; Sana et al. 2008; Mason et al. 2009;
Moe & Di Stefano 2017; Offner et al. 2023), and a substantial
fraction will interact at some point during their lifetimes (e.g.
Sana et al. 2012; de Mink et al. 2013; Marchant & Bodensteiner
2023). One common interaction channel is the exchange of mass
and angular momentum through a phase of stable mass trans-
fer (e.g., Kippenhahn & Weigert 1967). The initially more mas-
sive donor star is stripped of its hydrogen-rich envelope and the
companion star can accrete mass and angular momentum, spin-
ning up in the process (e.g., Paczy´nski 1971; Pols et al. 1991;
Marchant & Bodensteiner 2023).
The envelope-stripped stars exhibit a wide range of spec-
tral characteristics depending on their mass and the extent of
their remaining hydrogen envelope. The collective term stripped
star historically refers to helium white dwarfs (de Kool & Ritter
1993) and hot subdwarf stars (e.g., Heber 2009) at the low-mass
end, and to Wolf-Rayet stars (e.g., Paczy´nski 1967) in the high-
mass regime. More recently, intermediate-mass stripped stars
were identified with masses in the range ∼2 −8 M⊙that bridge
the helium star mass gap between subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet
stars (Götberg et al. 2018; Drout et al. 2023; Götberg et al. 2023).
Due to their high temperatures as exposed stellar cores, stripped
stars can contribute substantially to the ionising radiation of stel-
lar populations (e.g., Götberg et al. 2019). As the likely progeni-
tors of hydrogen-poor core collapse supernovae (e.g., Smith et al.
2011; Laplace et al. 2021), the stripped cores of massive stars
play an important role in the formation of black holes and neu-
tron stars.
The classical picture of envelope-stripped stars is that of hot,
compact stripped stars. However, recent studies have also identi-
fied cooler stripped stars in a transitional phase shortly after mass
transfer. These stars, still in an inflated state and contracting into
hot helium stars, have been dubbed "puffed-up" or "bloated" in
the recent literature (e.g., Villaseñor et al. 2023; Bodensteiner
et al. 2020a; Dutta & Klencki 2023). The first such systems re-
