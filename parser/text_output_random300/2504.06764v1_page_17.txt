Figure 2 | Intrinsic magnetic moment in Pt/FCGT with odd-number vdW layers. (a) 
Coloured optical microscope image of Pt/FCGT device in a three-dimensional rendering 
of the transport measurement setup. The area of FCGT flake is indicated by black dashed 
lines. (b and c) Temperature-dependent AHE hysteresis loops of Pt/FCGT devices with 
odd- (b) and even- (c) number vdW layers. (d and e) Cross-sectional HR-TEM images of 
Pt/FCGT devices with odd- (d) and even- (e) number vdW layers. The white lines indicate 
the interfaces of FCGT flakes and red dashed lines indicate the vdW layers. (f) AHE 
hysteresis loop of 9-layers FCGT at 120 K. (g) AHE of 9-layers FCGT with the preset of 
out-of-plane magnetic fields of 20 kOe (red line) and -20 kOe (blue line) by applying in-
plane magnetic fields at 120 K. The arrows indicate the directions of field sweeping.
