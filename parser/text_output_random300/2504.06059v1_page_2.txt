our second framework offers practical depth re-
duction compared to the state of the art. We also
show how this practical saving in depth is useful
to reach quantum utility.
One interesting application of our framework con-
cerns Boson sampling. In particular, we show that, if
we allow layers of MZIs with arbitrary connectivity,
Boson sampling experiments with m modes and n
photons can be performed using an interferometer
Vopt of depth O(n + log(m)) in worst-case.
This is
a significant reduction in depth as compared to, for
example, a Clements interferometer V performing a
Boson sampling experiment, where the depth is O(m).
Furthermore, even when considering losses due to
couplings which are present in interferometers with
layers of arbitrary connectivity, we show that for a
number of modes m >> n, the overall losses in Vopt
are still significantly smaller than in V .
Our results
therefore bring closer the possibility of experimentally
achieving quantum advantage for the Boson sampling
task with single photon inputs, a feat that to our
knowledge has never been performed.
The paper is structured as follows. Section II gives
background on linear optical circuit synthesis prior to
presenting our framework based on the Bruhat decom-
position in Section III. Then we discuss the compiler as-
sociated to our framework in Section IV. In Section V
we discuss two explicit examples of practical applica-
tions of this result.
In Section VI we present a de-
sign based on a greedy Gaussian elimination process
to perform shallow Boson sampling by coupling chips
together.
We discuss the optimal chip size and how
far we are from quantum utility in Section VII, before
concluding in Section VIII.
II.
BACKGROUND ON LINEAR OPTICAL
CIRCUITS
Here we briefly present the linear optical circuit
model before discussing known methods for implement-
ing given unitary operations in this picture.
A.
Linear optical circuits
An interferometer on m modes acts linearly on the
creation and annihilation operators a†
i, ai of each mode
i = 1 . . . m. Its action is represented by a unitary matrix
U such that

We arrange these components in linear optical
circuits to create more complex interferometers. The
sequential composition of two operators A, B, both
acting on the same subset of modes, gives the operator
BA.
The spatial composition of two operators A,
B acting on two disjoint subset of modes gives the
operator A ⊕B where ⊕is the direct sum operator.
A beampslitter and a phase-shifter can be used to
build a canonical Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI).
Here we define our MZI with an extra phase-shifter on
the input, as shown in Fig. 1. This MZI is parameterized
by ϕ, θ, and they verify the following property:

For the rest of this paper, the circuits are MZI-based.
Note that our results also extend to symmetric MZIs
where both phase shifters are internal.
This can be
achieved by applying specific commutation rules to the
original circuit, as done in [15].
The number of components in a circuit is the
number of MZIs, and the MZI-depth of a circuit is the
minimum number of time steps needed to execute a
circuit, provided that two non-overlapping MZIs can be
executed simultaneously. In our linear optical circuit
drawings, any 2-mode box will represent the MZI in
Fig. 1.
The structure of integrated interferometers is fixed
upon manufacture, and the only tuneable parameters
are the angles of the MZIs.
The compilation of a
unitary to the interferometer therefore consists of
