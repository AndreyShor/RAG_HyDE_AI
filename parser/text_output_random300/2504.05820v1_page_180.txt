NNLO polarized PDFs with MHOU
the total angular momentum, leaving significant room for a non-vanishing Lz, and a possible
explanation of its origin. Specifically, also the presence of proton’s anomalous magnetic moment
requires a nonzero orbital angular momentum. Different non-perturbative models, as well as
lattice QCD calculations (see [369] for an extensive review), allow us to predict values of the
components of Eq. (5.23), and in some cases are even able to relate them to a particular flavor
asymmetry.
Currently, the nucleon spin origin is still an open problem. Our updated determination of
polarized PDFs can be used to infer what is the most likely scenario suggested by the high-
energy scattering data. In Fig. 5.8 we display the truncated net-spin fraction

for the gluon (top), the quark singlet (middle) and the sum of the two contributions (bottom
plot) at the scale Q2 = 10 GeV2. The values are computed with the NLO and NNLO sets and
include MHOUs. As we probe smaller x values, the quark contribution appears to be convergent
and stable. At x = 10−3 the partial net-spin is equal to 0.14 ± 0.05. Unfortunately, the situation
is rather different for the gluon, where the poor accuracy of the PDFs in small-x region, prevents
us to predict a stable estimate of ηg, which results to be compatible with 0 and affected by a
large uncertainty. The poor knowledge of ∆g affects also the combined value of singlet and
gluon. In this respect our analysis shows that the EIC measurements are still needed to fully
resolve the proton content and its polarization at small-x.
Regarding a possible light flavor polarized sea asymmetry, our determination confirms the
finding of previous studies [370] with a ∆¯u > 0 > ∆¯d, with the magnitude of the difference
equal or greater than the unpolarized one and similar in shape as visible in Fig. 5.9.
