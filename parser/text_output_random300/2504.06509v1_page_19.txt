Electrical Measurements 
DC electrical measurements were performed using a Keithley 2400 multimeter. Resistance-
field (R-H) loops and minor loops were measured at varying applied currents. The currents are 
converted to the average voltage between AP and P states for voltage effect evaluation. To 
investigate the response time of VCEC-induced switching, we applied ultrafast voltage pulses 
to the MTJ using two pulse generators. The setup included a bias-tee circuit to enable 
simultaneous DC bias application and high-speed pulse injection (Fig. 3(a)). Model 5541A 
Bias Tee (80 kHz – 26 GHz, 8 ps rise time) was used. Generator 1: Picosecond Pulse Labs 
Pulse Generator 10,060A with the pulse width: 100 ps–10 ns, output voltage: 10 V, max rise 
time: 55 ps. Generator 2: Alnair Labs Electrical Pulse Generator (EPG-210B-0300-S-P-T-A) 
with the pulse width: 30 ps – 230 ps, output voltage: 5 V, rise time: 40 ps. All the switching 
results except for those shown in Extended Data Fig. 2 are collected by Generator 1. The output 
pulses profiles are collected by Tektronix DPO72004B digital phosphor oscilloscope with the 
bandwidth of up to 20 GHz.  
For measurement with fixed magnetic field, the external field was fixed near the AP-to-P 
switching threshold but remained stable enough to prevent spontaneous switching. Each minor 
loop measurement was repeated 100 times (2 Oe/s) per device to precisely extract the AP-to-P 
switching field. A field with zero spontaneous switching probability was chosen to ensure that 
all observed switching was induced by the applied voltage pulse rather than thermal agitation. 
Switching probability is calculated based on 100 trials for those tests.
