Introduction
Understanding the dynamics of the transition between hadronic to quark-gluon phases is one of
the outstanding issues in strong interaction physics. For cold dense nuclear matter such transitions
are relevant for the dynamics that can exist at the cores of neutron stars and can set the limits for
the matter density before it collapses to the black hole. There are few options to investigate such
transitions in terrestrial experiments These include studying nuclear medium modification of quark-
gluon structure of bound nucleons in semi-inclusive processes which allow to control inter-nucleon
distances[1] or probing deep inelastic scattering from nuclear target at Bjorken 𝑥> 1[2–4].
Another venue in exploration of non-nucleonic components in nuclei is the probing the nuclear
repulsive core. The nuclear repulsive core is a unique property of nuclear forces that keeps nuclei
from collapsing and provides condition for the nuclear density to saturate. Its dynamics is still
elusive, however QCD gives a new perspective on the dynamical origin of the nuclear core. In the
𝑁𝑁system at very short distances the QCD predicts the existence of substantial component due
to non-nucleonic ΔΔ as well as hidden color components[5, 6] that contribute almost 90% of the
strength at distances dominated by the repulsion (Fig.1). In such a scenario the repulsion is due

to the orthogonality between the wave functions of the observed NN state and the non-nucleonic
component dominating in the core.
To probe the validity of such a scenario for the generation of nuclear repulsion one needs
to probe deuteron wave function at internal momenta ≳800 MeV/C. In the present work, new
approach[7] is suggested in probing the deuteron at extremely large internal momenta.

Deuteron on the light front (LF)
Non-relativistic picture of the deuteron suggests that the observations of total isospin, 𝐼= 0,
total spin, 𝐽= 1 and positive parity, 𝑃, together with the relation, 𝑃= (−1)𝑙, indicate that the
deuteron consists of bound proton and neutron in S- and D- partial wave states.
However, for the deuteron structure with internal momenta comparable to the nucleon rest mass
the nonrelativistic framework is not valid requiring a consistent account for the relativistic effects.
There are several theoretical approaches for accounting for relativistic effects in the deuteron wave
