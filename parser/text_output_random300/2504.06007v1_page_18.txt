Rain amount and Rain Frequency
The calculation of rain amount and rain frequency follows the method outlined in Pendergrass and Hartmann [2014],
but we summarize the approach here for completeness. The rain-rate distribution is constructed using logarithmically
spaced bins, where each bin is 7% wider than the previous one, with its center shifted accordingly. Only rain rates
exceeding 0.03 mm day−1 are included, while dry days are defined by a precipitation threshold of 0.0321 mm day−1.
At each grid point, we first compute a histogram of rain rates and normalize it by the total number of days to obtain
the rain frequency distribution. The total precipitation amount within each bin is then summed to construct the rain
amount distribution. Finally, these distributions are averaged globally using an area-weighted approach to produce the
global-mean distributions. To formalize this, we define the probability distribution of rain amount p and rain frequency
f for each dataset, using daily rain accumulation r from model output or gridded observations. The bin edges are
denoted as T l
i (left) and T r
i (right), with the bin centers defined as T c
i = (T l
i + T r
i )/2. The transformation of the
distribution is expressed mathematically as follows:

where A is the grid cell area, and Nd represents the number of days in the dataset. The bin width is set as

ensuring sufficient resolution to capture the distribution of rain rates.

Low Frequency Variability
To extract the leading patterns of variability, we perform an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition on the
monthly anomaly fields. The climatology is defined as the monthly mean computed over the full 30-year simulation
or reanalysis record. Prior to decomposition, all fields are area-weighted by the square root of the cosine of latitude
to account for variations in grid cell area. We represent the spatial patterns by regressing the field pointwise onto a
one-standard-deviation change in the corresponding temporal principal component.
We examine the DJF Pacific–North American (PNA) pattern and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in detail.
Following [Phillips et al., 2014] (NCAR’s Climate Variability Diagnostic Package), these patterns are defined as the
leading modes of atmospheric variability over the regions [20–85°N, 120°E–120°W] and [20–80°N, 90°W–40°E],
respectively.
The eight strongest El Niño and La Niña events are identified using the Niño3.4 index from the observational record.
The December El Niño years include 1979, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1991, 1994, 1997, and 2002, while the December La
Niña years include 1983, 1984, 1988, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2007. The composite precipitation pattern is then
calculated by computing the DJF seasonal averages and subtracting the La Niña composite field from the El Niño
composite field.

Model Grid and Conservation Schemes
CAMulator leverages a hybrid sigma-pressure coordinate system, where vertical integrals are computed by first
determining the local pressure value. The pressure at each model level k is given by:
P(i, j, k) = AkP0 + BkPS(i, j)
