Experimental Setup
Figure S1(a)-(c) illustrates the detailed experimental setup. A complete description is
provided in the Methods section of the main text.
Simulation of the Resonance Mode and the Current Distribution
We use the electromagnetic field analysis software (Level3Gold Antenna, Sonnet) to sim-
ulate the current distribution in the resonator. Figure S2(a) shows the configuration and
settings used for the simulation. To simplify the calculation, the width of the nanowire is
set to 100 nm. To estimate the kinetic inductance of the resonator, the resonance frequen-
cies of the first mode are plotted as a function of Lk (Fig. S2(b)). A value of 0.656 µH
reproduces the experimentally observed frequency of the first resonance mode. Figure S2(c)
shows both the simulated transmission spectrum of the resonator for Lk = 0.65µH and the
