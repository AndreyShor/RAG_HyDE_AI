cant fraction of dual AGNs in simulations are obscured,
and often missed from observational searches targeting
unobscured broad-line AGNs (Chen et al. 2023a); (iii)
the dual AGN fraction seems to be elevated at the few-
kpc scales compared with the fraction at larger separa-
tions (Shen et al. 2023a); (iv) there is marginal evidence
for redshift evolution of the dual AGN fraction (e.g., Li
et al. 2024).
In this work, we present an observational search for
luminous dual AGNs, or dual quasars (the most lumi-
nous subset of AGNs), by combining SDSS and Gaia
data. The SDSS DR16 quasar catalog (Lyke et al. 2020)
provides the input quasar sample, and the Gaia DR3
catalog (DR3; Babusiaux et al. 2023) provides resolved
pairs around these luminous AGNs (or quasars) down
to sub-arcsec separations.
This work is an extension
of an earlier work (Shen et al. 2023a) that focused on
the z > 1.5 regime. Our new sample extends to lower
redshifts at z > 0.5, as well as slightly fainter fluxes of
G < 20.5, compared with the threshold of G < 20.25
used in Shen et al. (2023a). This expanded sample and
better statistics will enable an investigation on the red-
shift evolution of the dual quasar fraction, as well as the
dual quasar fraction as a function of pair separation.
The Gaia DR3 catalog have precise coordinates,
magnitudes, and astrometric measurements for all-sky
sources to as faint as G ∼21, which provides several ad-
vantages to search for quasar pairs. First, the nominal
∼0.′′2 resolution can resolve extremely close compan-
ions around distant quasars. Second, as demonstrated
in Shen et al. (2023a), the accurate Gaia proper-motion
measurements enable an efficient method to separate
stars and quasars, a unique advantage over previous
quasar pair searches based on ground-based photometric
color selection.
In this work, we focus on the luminous unobscured
(broad-line) quasars exclusively, given the nature and
survey depths of SDSS and Gaia. By default, “quasar
pairs” or “dual quasars” (e.g., Comerford et al. 2009)
refers to physically-associated quasar pairs inside the
merging galaxies, instead of unrelated, projected quasar
pairs at different redshifts. A common contaminant to
dual quasar searches is gravitationally lensed quasars,
which are often difficult to exclude from the sample
without detailed follow-up observations and/or mod-
elling (e.g., Chen et al. 2022; Gross et al. 2024; Ji
et al. 2024). For convenience, we use the term “dou-
ble quasars” to collectively describe both quasar pairs
and lensed quasars. We adopt a flat ΛCDM cosmology
with ΩΛ = 0.7, ΩM = 0.3, and H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1.
Pair physical separations are measured in proper units,
and correspond to the projected separations.
2. DATA
2.1. Crossmatch and Classification
We start from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
Release 16 quasar catalog (DR16Q; Lyke et al. 2020)
with improved systemic redshifts from Wu & Shen
(2022), which includes 750,414 spectroscopically con-
firmed quasars and their properties. First, we search for
Gaia DR3 sources in a 3′′-radius circular region around
each SDSS quasar and identify 492,724 systems with at
least one Gaia sources near the position of the DR16Q
quasar. Given the depths of the SDSS DR16Q and Gaia,
not all SDSS quasars are detected in Gaia. Among these
Gaia-matched quasars, 2,524 systems have two Gaia de-
tections around the DR16 quasar. 27 pairs have both
components classified as bona fide quasars in DR16Q,
resulting in double counting. After removing these du-
plicates, our initial Gaia-resolved pair sample includes
2,497 unique pairs. The detailed descriptions of cross-
match samples can be found in Table 1.
Similar to Shen et al. (2023a), we focus on Gaia-
resolved double sources within 3′′ of the SDSS quasar
position. The completeness of systems with more than
two Gaia sources within this radius is significantly lower
and hard to quantify. Matched multiple systems con-
stitute only ∼0.7% of double systems (Shen et al.
2023a) and are therefore negligible for subsequent sta-
tistical analyses. As a result, we ignore these higher-
order multiple populations. Additionally, quasars with
only one matched Gaia source may still contain subarc-
second quasar pairs, which require other methods and
additional Gaia parameters to identify (e.g., Shen et al.
2019; Hwang et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2022; Makarov &
Secrest 2022; Mannucci et al. 2022; Sandoval et al. 2023;
Wu et al. 2024; Schwartzman et al. 2024), which are not
covered here. The completeness analysis in Section 2.4
accounts for their contribution to the pair statistics.
For each pair, the closer Gaia match is denoted as the
corresponding SDSS quasar, which is generally the case.
Only in a few pairs with separations less than ∼1′′, the
companion might dominate the SDSS optical centroid,
meaning the closer Gaia match could actually be the
companion. Nevertheless, this detail has minimal im-
pact on any of our statistical analyses below. We also
check cutout images from PanSTARRS (e.g., Chambers
et al. 2016; Flewelling et al. 2020) for pairs in our Gaia-
resolved pair sample, and most of the pairs with sepa-
rations > 1′′ show two resolved sources or two “nuclei”.
Examples of cutout images of pairs in the gri bands from
PanSTARRS, with similar coverage to the Gaia G band,
are shown in Figure 2. These images illustrate that the
two sources are always resolved when their separation
