Fig. 9(a) shows a zoom at the crack tip of the retrieved average strain shown in Fig. 8(d). A
heuristic for the further propagation of the crack would be that it follows the valley of compressive
strain with tensile strain in its wake. Fig. 9(b) shows the corresponding prediction.

while (c) is unpeened.
To determine the strain field around the crack tip rather than along the crack path, high-resolution
scans with a step size of 1 micrometer was conducted in the crack-tip region. Following the same
procedure applied to the above scan, the resulting εavg maps for three distinct samples are depicted
in Fig. 10(a-c). Fig. 10(a) corresponds to the sample previously analyzed in the overview scan and
data analysis sections, which is shot-peened, while Fig. 10(b) and Fig. 10(c) illustrate the results for
two additional samples, with (b) being shot-peened and (c) being unpeened. A comparable strain
distribution around the crack tip in a fatigue-cracked Al-Li alloy sample was reported by Steuwer
et al. (Steuwer et al., 2010), showing tensile strain ahead of the crack tip and compressive strain in
the wake. In contrast, our results indicate compressive strain ahead of the crack and tensile strain
in the wake.

Discussion
The initial analysis revealed effects of dynamic crystal recovery at the vicinity of the crack (see
Fig. 6). This provided a basis for further investigation of the strain distribution along the surface.
The εavg strain map from the initial overview scan shows strain distribution predominately along
the surface (see Fig. 8(d)). The subsequent high-resolution scan focused at the crack-tip offered a
detailed view of the localized strain behavior. The strain field at the crack tip reveals a significant
departure from the predictions of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). LEFM anticipates
strain singularities at crack tips, where strain magnitudes theoretically approach infinity under
idealized conditions (Anderson & Anderson, 2005).
