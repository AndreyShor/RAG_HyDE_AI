and certain joint configurations may be physically incom-
patible. These constraints are encoded through the fusion
coefficients F ij
k , which determine the probability ampli-
tude of action tokens i and j fusing into a resultant state
k. The non-zero elements of F ij
k precisely delineate the
physically admissible transitions in the action space.
Conservation law preservation constitutes the second
category of constraints.
Physical systems necessarily
preserve certain invariants including object constraints
and kinematic feasibility.
The consistency conditions
C(i, j, k) encode these conservation laws by imposing the
relation:
(14)
X
m,n
F ij
mF mk
n
=
X
p,q
F ik
p F pj
q
This relation is equivalent to the pentagon equation in cat-
egory theory, ensuring that different sequences of actions
leading to the same outcome maintain physical consis-
tency. The satisfaction of this condition guarantees that
the physical consequences of action sequences are path-
independent when they should be, a necessary condition
for physical realism.
Temporal structuring represents the third category. Long-
horizon planning requires actions to maintain temporal
coherence across extended sequences. Mtopo encodes this
through a block structure that imposes constraints be-
tween action primitives P i
t and P j
t , ensuring that tran-
sitions between primitive blocks maintain causal consis-
tency. The temporal structure is formally represented as a
partial ordering relation that guarantees the physical fea-
sibility of generated action sequences.
The construction of Mtopo follows a three-phase process.
First, we initialize the matrix using physical priors about
valid action transitions, establishing baseline constraints
derived from fundamental physical laws.
Second, we
apply consistency refinement by enforcing the pentagon
and hexagon equations, guaranteeing global consistency
from local constraints. Finally, during training, we em-
ploy learned adaptation through a separate projection head
that maintains the topological structure while adapting to
task-specific requirements. This projection operation is
formally defined as:
(15)
Mtopo ←ΠT (Mtopo + η∇ML)
where ΠT is a projection operator that enforces the re-
quired topological constraints.
Unlike standard attention masks that merely control in-
formation flow, Mtopo encodes rich structural informa-
tion about the physical world, providing a formally rig-
orous framework that constrains the model to generate
only physically valid action sequences. The mathemati-
cal formalism underlying Mtopo guarantees that the result-
ing attention mechanism respects the fundamental physi-
cal constraints of the problem domain.

Integration Technique
Instead of using a simple forward Euler scheme (which
often requires many small steps or suffers from numerical
instability), we adopt a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method
for the flow-matching process.
This higher-order inte-
gration balances computational cost with accuracy; it al-
lows us to take fewer, larger steps (only four integration
substeps per action sequence) while still preserving fine-
grained trajectory quality.
In practice, this reduces in-
ference time by over 40% compared to a 10-step Euler
method, without sacrificing the precision needed for pre-
cise robot control. Moreover, Runge-Kutta’s reduced er-
ror accumulation translates to more stable policy outputs,
minimizing the risk of drift or compounding minor errors
across a long-horizon task. Our specific implementation
follows:
(16)
Aτ+δ
t
= Aτ
t + δ
6(k1 + 2k2 + 2k3 + k4)
Where:
k1 = vθ(Aτ
t , ot)
(17)
k2 = vθ(Aτ
t + δ
2k1, ot)
(18)
k3 = vθ(Aτ
t + δ
2k2, ot)
(19)
k4 = vθ(Aτ
t + δk3, ot)
(20)
This higher-order method allows for larger step sizes (δ =
0.25) and fewer integration steps (4 instead of 10) while
achieving superior accuracy.

Training Objective
We augment the flow matching loss with complementary
objectives:
L(θ) = Lflow(θ)+λ1Ltask(θ)+λ2Lsmooth(θ)+λ3Ltopo(θ)
(21)
Where Ltopo(θ) is our novel topological consistency loss:
Ltopo(θ)
= Ep(At|ot),q(Aτ
t |At) ∥F(vθ(Aτ
t , ot))−F(u(Aτ
t |At))∥2
