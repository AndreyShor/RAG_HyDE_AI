Figure 1(a) presents a perspective view of the meta-grating illuminated under normal incidence, 
while Figure 1(b) demonstrates the cross-sectional profile of 4 neighboring unit cells. The 
simulations are carried out by systematically varying the refractive index of the surrounding 
environment above the meta-grating to evaluate the sensing response. The periodic triangular 
profile supports multi-resonant behavior and strong lightâ€“matter interaction, making it suitable for 
assessing the performance of full-spectrum machine learning models under varying physical 
regimes. 
 
3. Simulation Results 
Figure 2 presents the absorption spectra of the meta-grating for different material and 
polarization combinations, with the refractive index of the environment fixed at 1. Figures 2(a) 
and (b) correspond to the Ti-based meta-grating under TM and TE polarizations, respectively. Both 
configurations display smooth, broadband absorption profiles with low spectral feature density. 
The spectra lack sharp resonances and instead show gradual intensity variations across the 
wavelength range. This behavior is characteristic of lossy metallic nanostructures and suggests that 
the optical response is dominated by broadband absorption rather than discrete resonance effects. 
Figures 2(c) and (d) show the Si-based meta-grating under TM and TE polarizations, 
respectively. In these cases, the spectra exhibit a series of narrow, well-resolved resonances, 
indicative of Mie-type modes supported by high-index dielectric materials27. The spectral profiles 
show greater feature density and sharper variations compared to the Ti cases, and the position and 
spacing of the resonances differ slightly between TE and TM modes due to the anisotropic response 
of the structure. These differences in spectral shape across materials and polarizations set the 
foundation for evaluating how spectral modality influences modeling strategies in subsequent 
analyses.
