where the rescaled growth rate is ¯𝜔= St 𝜔. Equation (5.8) provides an equation for ¯𝜔
depending on the parameter 𝑞= 𝛼𝜋/(𝜅St). Analytical progress can be made by truncating
the sum at 𝑛= 0, i.e. considering only the first term. This leads to

From this, we can identify the critical value for the parameter 𝑞at which the transition to
underdamped dynamics occurs: 𝑞𝑐= 4/𝜆6
0.
A natural question to ask now is if fluid inertia can alter the development of the two
flow regimes outlined previously in Section 3.2? Proceeding as before, we assume a forcing
𝑓(𝑡) = 𝐵𝑒2𝜋𝑖𝑡, and try an ansatz Δ𝑝0 = 𝐴𝑒2𝜋𝑖𝑡. Substitution into the integral equation (5.7)
and neglecting contributions from the initial conditions yields
2𝜋𝑖𝛼𝐴=

It is convenient to define the function G : R →C, given by G(St) = Í∞
𝑛=0 𝜆−2

𝑛).
We find that the response (characterized by 𝐴) is related to the forcing (characterized by 𝐵)
through
𝐴=
−2𝐵G(St)
2𝜋𝑖𝛼+ 𝜋𝜅G(St) .
(5.11)
Therefore, we see that the angle of the complex quantity
𝜒=
G(St)
2𝜋𝑖𝛼+ 𝜋𝜅G(St)
(5.12)
will determine if the deformation follows the angular velocity (if the angle is close to 𝜋/2) or
the angular acceleration (when the angle is close to 0 or multiples of 𝜋). To achieve analytical
progress we truncate the sum in G, keeping only the first term, and we find
Re(𝜒) = 𝜋𝜅−4𝜋2St𝛼𝜆2
0,
Im(𝜒) = 2𝜋𝛼𝜆4
0.
(5.13)
Therefore, the curve in the parameter space (𝜅, St) separating the two regimes is given
implicitly by

In Figure 8(c), we plot the argument of 𝜒as a function of 𝜅and St, indicating as well the
approximate bifurcation curves given by (5.14). This diagram indicates where in the 𝜅-St
phase space the cupula deflection follows the angular velocity versus the angular acceleration.
For small values of the Stokes number St we recover the previous picture, where 𝜅≪1
indicates the deformation follows the angular velocity and 𝜅≫1 indicates the response is
guided by the angular acceleration. But we also find a nonlinear dependence on St for non-
small Stokes numbers. For given 𝜅less than about 100, a transition to angular acceleration
tracking occurs for St greater than about 1, meaning that the cupula system may be tuned
to follow angular acceleration even for small cupula stiffness if the Stokes number is high
