Probabilistic
All triviality results presented thus far concern deterministic multipartite
functions. Brassard et al. [5] found that this still applies when considering
probabilistic multipartite computation.
Theorem 7. In a world in which noisy non-local boxes which succeed more
than 3+

≈90.8% exist, all probabilistic functions can be distributively com-
puted.
This lets us deﬁne the set of boxes that trivialize communication com-
plexity.
Corollary 2. Let Bcc = 4
p
2/3 ≈3.266, then all boxes P such that CHSH(P) >
Bcc trivialize communication complexity.
The CHSH value of a symmetric non-local box with probability of success

is 4

2/3 and using the depolarization protocol described in section 2.1,
all boxes above CHSH value Bcc trivialize communication complexity.

Non-local Games
All the results of this section are due to Cleve et al.[10], except for the ones
of section 4.3. Those last are from Linden et al. [17].
When playing a non-local game, Alice and Bob are space-like separated
but allowed to share randomness. They are, however, allowed to elaborate a
strategy beforehand. Alice and Bob respectively receive x ∈X and y ∈Y
picked at random according to the probability distribution π. They must
respectively output a ∈A and b ∈B. They win if V (a, b, x, y) = 1.
Deﬁnition 9. A non-local game G = (X ×Y, A×B, π, V ) consists of a set of
inputs X ×Y , a set of outputs A×B, a probability distribution π : X ×Y →
[0, 1] and a predicate V : X × Y × A × B →{0, 1}.
Next is deﬁned the best probability with which Alice and Bob can win a
game when they are restricted to classical strategies, i.e., strategies that do
not make use of non-locality.
