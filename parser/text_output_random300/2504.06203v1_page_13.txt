We write the corresponding generalized pinning defect as DN
± (O) with O among the list in (A.14) with the orientation specified
by the first diagram in Figure 4.
The flows triggered by ψ, ˜ψ (related by a parity flip) are studied in [45, 47]. Since these deforming operators are purely
(anti)chiral, the corresponding defects are translation invariant along the entire flow, and thus must become topological in the
IR [45, 47]. By g-theorem, the IR defect can either be η or 1, and the choice is fixed by studying the fusion with conformal
boundaries of the Ising CFT [47],

Let us now consider the flow triggered by the disorder spin operator µ. From the left diagram in Figure 4, we find that this is
related to the pinning flow from the trivial defect and then fused onto N,
DN
± (µ) = D±(σ)N ,

from we which we conclude
DN
+ (µ) = |f⟩⟨+| ,
DN
−(µ) = |f⟩⟨−| ,
(A.17)
where {|+⟩, |−⟩= η|+⟩, |f⟩= N|+⟩} are the three simple boundary conditions of the Ising CFT.
There are also interesting flows when LUV is not simple. For example, let us take LUV = 1 ⊕η and consider pinning defects

±
(O) with O from (A.14) (defined in a similar way as in the first diagram in Figure 4). In this case, clearly the IR behavior
does not depend on the sign of the pinning field. Furthermore, from the last diagram in Figure 4, we deduce immediately [110]
D1⊕η
±
(µ) = ND±(σ)N = |f⟩⟨f| .

Similarly, by (A.15) and fusion with N, we also have

diagrams arise from topological moves in the Ising CFT relating different pinning flows.
Appendix B: Existence of self-adjoint extension of regularized ˆO
In the main text, we have considered the following sesquilinear form defined for two states |ϕf⟩, |ϕg⟩∈H as defined in (II.2)
via the CFT three-point functions with the operator O that defines the pinning defect,

(B.1)
where for simplicity, we have included the contributions from scalar primaries in (II.2). Although the RHS of (B.1) defines a
Hermitian sesquilinear form densely on H, it does not guarantee the existence of a self-adjoint operator (which one naively would
like to call ˆO) whose matrix elements coincide with the above on a dense subspace. This is because ˆO, as is defined in (I.1),
is worse than unbounded, since it has a trivial domain in general. This is a consequence of non-integrable singularities in the
OO OPE (from identity operators and other light operators) that dominate the four-point function (in the t-channel) ⟨ψ|OO|ψ⟩
which governs the norm of a state ˆO|ψ⟩for |ψ⟩∈H.
To cure this divergent norm, we need to regularize ˆO. A naive guess would be to introduce an energy cutoff in the s-channel
exchange (summing over all states created by ˆO|ψ⟩with energy truncation). However, for our purpose, it’s important to preserve
conformal symmetry. Therefore we instead introduce a truncation in the conformal primaries which generate the subspace
H∆⊂H. Assuming discreteness in the CFT spectrum, this amounts to truncating the infinite sum over s-channel conformal
