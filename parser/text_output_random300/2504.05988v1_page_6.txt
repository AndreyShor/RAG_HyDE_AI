Figure 4: (Left) Illustration of ω for the SCR with a pole localized at z1, de-
limiting the regions I and II. (Right) We draw the solutions taken with initial
conditions in each region. We show several solutions (dashed) depending on the
initial condition inside the region II. The blue dashed solution is chosen to be
continuously connected to the solution of the previous region.

the regions I and II with opposite sign. (Right) We draw the solutions taken with
initial conditions in each region. We show several solutions (dashed) depending
on the initial condition inside the region II.
