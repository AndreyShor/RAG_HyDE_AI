and it remains to estimate the RHS. To this end, we exploit the monotonicity of fractional
moments (3.2) by replacing ϑ with ϑ1
δ Ó ´8 and applying the log-normality (1.12). Let us
fix a parameter ϱ P p0, 8q.
‚ We rewrite the log-normality (1.12) by renaming δϱ

2 ϱ ϑ as δ, i.e. expressing
ϑ “ ´ 1

We note that this weak convergence also implies convergence of fractional moments,
because the LHS of (3.7) is bounded in L1 (recall that ErZ ϑ
t pdxqs “ dx).
‚ If we set ϑ1
δ :“ ´ 1
ϱ log 1
δ2 Ñ ´8 as δ Ó 0, then we can apply the monotonicity of
fractional moments (3.2) with φ “ UBpx,δq to estimate the RHS of (3.6).
Overall, we obtain for any fixed α P p0, 1q

where in the last equality we plugged in the value of σ “ logp1 ` ϱq from (3.7). Since
αp1 ´ αq ą 0 for α P p0, 1q, letting ϱ Ñ 8 we finally obtain ErLpω, xqαs “ 0.

3.2. Log-normality of the SHF. We prove Theorem 1.2 on the log-normality of
the SHF. More precisely we deduce it from the corresponding result for directed polymers,
see Theorem 1.8 (which we prove in Section 4).
To this end, recalling the uniform distribution on continuum and discrete balls, see (1.8)
and (1.23), from the convergence in distribution (1.20), we obtain

Strictly speaking we cannot plug UBpx,δqp¨q as a test function into (1.20), because it is not
continuous. However, for any ε ą 0, we can approximate φεp¨q ď UBpx,δqp¨q ď ψεp¨q with
continuos functions φε, ψε such that 0 ď ψεp¨q ´ φεp¨q ď 1Aεp¨q, where we define the annulus
Aε :“ Bpx, δ ` εqzBpx, δ ´ εq. Replacing UBpx,δqp¨q by φε or ψε in (1.20), we commit an
error in L1 which is Opεq, i.e. the Lebesgue measure of Aε. This justifies (3.8).
Proof of Theorem 1.2. We fix t ą 0, x P R2, ϱ P p0, 8q and define δϑ :“ e
1
2 ϑ as in (1.11).
It suffices to prove the convergence in distribution (1.12) when ϑ ranges in an arbitrary
negative sequence ϑk “ ´|ϑk| Ñ ´8, which we fix henceforth. Introducing the shorthands

we need to show that Yk Ñ Y in distribution. It suffices to fix any bounded and continuous
function Φ : R Ñ R and to prove that
