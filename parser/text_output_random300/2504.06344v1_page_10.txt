perturbations. Additionally, we found that the analytical ∆-expansion solution aligns
with numerical results when gcd(k, r) = r for small enough values of ∆, suggesting
that perturbations on top of the analytical ∆-expansion solution preserve it. Yet, it
is desirable to find an analytical mathematical statement to confirm this finding. In
particular, a future research direction would be the exploration of the interplay between
the λ- and ∆-expansions.
2. Our findings for the case gcd(k, r) ̸= r and ∆(r, k, ℓ) = 0 highlight the need for further
investigation. A key open question concerns the number of bosonic and fermionic zero
modes in this background (which is only understood numerically). Even though one
expects from the index theorem that this number is 4r and 2r for the bosonic and adjoint
fermion zero modes, a numerical confirmation is desired. The fermionic zero modes, in
particular, can be explored through numerical lattice studies by analyzing the spectrum
of adjoint fermions in the fractional instanton background, following approaches such
as those in [56–58] or the more recent [59].
3. Our numerical studies of the cases r=k=2 and r=2, k=1 with ∆(r, k, ℓ)=0 (rℓL3L4 =
kL1L2), all within the gauge group SU(3), showed drastically different qualitative be-
havior between the two cases with the same topological charge 2/3. Contrasting these
results with the ∆-expansion gives the following puzzle. In principle, the analytical solu-
tion that corresponds to the numerical study with r=2, k=1 and ∆(r, k, ℓ)=∆(2, 1, 2)=0
can be obtained starting from the constant-F analytical solution with r=k=2 (re-
call that this analytical solution has 8 compact moduli identified as translations and
holonomies) taking ∆(r, k, ℓ)=∆(2, 2, 1)=−3.
We know from the numerical studies
that the analytical solution with r=k=2 and ∆(r, k, ℓ)=∆(2, 2, 1)=−3 has a drasti-
cally different qualitative behavior compared to the analytical solution r=2, k=2 and
∆(r, k, ℓ)=∆(2, 2, 1) = 0. This means that as we consider large values of ∆, an intriguing
mathematical structure should account for this dramatic shift in behavior.
4. From the more formal mathematical side, a further study of the moduli space of the
Q = r/2, r ≥2, instantons in SU(2), the topic of section 4.4, is of great interest.
We considered the full set of nonlinear equations obeyed by the self-duality preserving
fluctuations around the constant-F solution on the tuned-T4, but were only able to
show that these imply the correct dimensionality of the moduli space. Showing that the
nonlinear equations for S, eqns. (4.23, 4.22,4.24) of section 4.4, lead to compactification
of the moduli space and determine its global structure (for r = 2 studied in [55]) remains
a challenge. In addition, it would be of interest to generalize the analytic arguments of
section 4.4 to general N, r, k with gcd(r, k) ̸= r.
