Figure 2. Snapshots of the evolution of different quantities for the case β = 2 with µ = 1.0 with
rm = 20RH(t0), corresponding to a case of PBH formation with type II-A PBH.
type-II A PBHs), type-II fluctuations with the formation of a bifurcated trapping horizon
(leading to type-II B PBHs), and type-II fluctuations that do not form PBHs.
First, we present the results in Fig.2 for the parameters β = 2 and µ = 1.0, corre-
sponding to a scenario where the fluctuation amplitude is significantly above the threshold,
resulting in the formation of type II-A PBHs. At the initial time t0, we observe the throat-
neck structure in the areal radius R, which causes the function Γ to take negative values.
The initial compaction function exhibits two distinct peaks, with a local minimum at rm. As
the fluctuation reenters the cosmological horizon and starts the non-linear regime of gravita-
tional collapse, we observe a behaviour similar to that of over-threshold type-I fluctuations:
a collapsing process in which the peak of the energy density increases continuously over time,
accompanied by a negative Eulerian velocity near the central region.
We also note that
the Misner-Sharp mass develops a local minimum during a period of the evolution. This
behaviour is a consequence of the non-monotonicity of the areal radius, which causes the
Misner-Sharp mass not to increase monotonically with R (see Eq.(2.4)). At sufficiently late
times, the compaction function develops a single peak and Γ becomes positive throughout
the entire radial domain (indicating that the non-monotonic behaviour of R disappears). At
later times, specifically around t/tH ≈9.84 , a black hole is formed (see the lower-middle and
lower-right panels for the expansion of the congruences and the configuration of the horizons),
corresponding to the typical trapping horizon configurations associated with type-A PBHs.
