preserved, and the iterative nature of this method enables the model to propagate pre-
dictions over longer horizons, albeit with potential accumulation of errors.

Metrics for Comparison
Evaluating the performance of models in fluid dynamics requires reliable metrics that not
only assess the accuracy of predictions but also provide insights into potential errors and
variations. For such assessments, uncertainty quantification (UQ) has been implemented
along with metrics such as the average Relative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE) to
evaluate prediction reliability and measure the accuracy and robustness of the models.
2.6.1
Relative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE)
RRMSE is a normalized version of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), providing a relative
measure of error by comparing the model prediction deviations with the range or mean
of the observed data. It is defined as:
RRMSE =
q
1
N
PN
i=1(yi −ˆyi)2
¯y
(17)
where yi represents the observed values, ˆyi the predicted values, N the total number of
samples, and ¯y the mean of the observed values. The average of which has been presented
in the results section.
RRMSE provides a relative error metric that is independent of the scale of the data,
making it suitable for comparing models across different data sets or scales.
Lower
RRMSE values indicate higher prediction accuracy.

Uncertainty Quantification
Accurate predictions in fluid dynamics are crucial, but it is equally important to quantify
the uncertainties associated with these predictions to understand their reliability and
robustness.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) allows the assessment of potential errors
and variations in predictions, which is essential to make informed decisions in various
fluid dynamics applications.
In this analysis, UQ is performed by calculating the normalized error between the
original tensor data and its reconstructed counterpart. The errors across each velocity
component are quantified using probability density functions (PDFs), offering a statistical
depiction of the uncertainties. This approach allows us to visualize and interpret error
distributions effectively, highlighting the performance differences between the HOSVD
and SVD methods. By analyzing these error distributions, areas can be identified where
the models perform well and where improvements may be necessary, ultimately enhancing
the predictive accuracy of our models.
The normalized error for each velocity component is given by [53]:
