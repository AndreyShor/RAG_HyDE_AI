tigate interface effects, capitalizing on the breaking of the center of symmetry at the interface. In 
contrast, the second-order non-linear technique, VSFS necessitates alterations in both dipole and 
polarizability, which predominantly occur at the interface. The key concept is that the contribu- 
tion from the bulk solution is negligible, with the primary signal arising from the loss of inversion 
symmetry at the interface and the decaying electric field at the surface.12–14,14–17,42 
Previously, it was believed that interface effects would be confined within a narrow region of 
1-2 nm, in contrast to the non-linear coherence length, which could extend to tens of nanometers 
depending on the structural characteristics. However, if the electric field at the interface becomes 
sufficiently intense and comparable to the non-linear coherence length, interference effects may 
arise. In such cases, the non-linear optical signal at the interface is influenced not only by the sur- 
face potential but also by a screening factor, which encompasses the interface effects as a function 
of both the wave vector mismatch and the Debye length.14,42,43 
Now, in the case of plasmonic quantum dots such as gold nanoparticles and graphene quantum 
dots, where the loosely bound surface electrons exhibit strong interactions with the electromagnetic 
radiation in NLO experiments, showcasing an overall excitonic behavior, we expect the primary 
contribution to NLO signals to arise from the surface, with a diffuse contribution extending from 
the surface to the bulk. Where SHG, SFG, VSFG, etc would limit our understanding to surface 
properties alone. However, by utilizing standard 2DES, we can overcome this limitation. 2DES 
enables the comprehensive investigation of both surface and bulk information in quantum dots, 
providing a holistic view of the entire system. 
By monitoring the interface as a function of wave vector mismatch and the Debye length, 2DES 
allows us to capture the intricate dynamics occurring across the entire quantum dot system, from 
interface to bulk. Moreover, 2DES exhibits remarkable sensitivity to phase information, further 
enhancing its superiority in elucidating the interplay between surface and bulk phenomena. In the 
context of the interface, the presence of solvent molecules, which maintain a specific orientation 
depending on the surface potential, renders this region highly susceptible to polarization effects. 
The interface, in conjunction with the electrical double layer, gives rise to the establishment of
