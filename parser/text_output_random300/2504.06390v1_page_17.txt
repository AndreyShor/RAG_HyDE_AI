The overall spectral shape is governed by the interplay between linear enhancement and
nonlinear absorption suppression. For low photon energies, the nonlinear component domi-
nates — as previously observed in Figure 3 — leading to a negative total absorption coef-
ficient near the resonance. This negative region, often associated with saturable absorption
or optical bleaching, indicates that the material becomes more transparent under intense
illumination, a hallmark of strong nonlinear response.
In Figure 4(a), which corresponds to the case without an applied electric field (F = 0), the
total optical absorption coefficient exhibits a distinctive negative peak across all substrates
and magnetic field values. This behavior results from the dominance of the third-order non-
linear contribution, which outweighs the linear absorption near the polaron resonance energy.
As the magnetic field increases from 0.05T, the depth of the absorption dip becomes more
pronounced and shifts toward higher photon energies, reflecting the progressive widening
of the polaron-induced energy gap. The strongest negative response for the SiO2 and SiC
substrates is consistent with their favorable balance between the polarization parameter η
and surface phonon energy ℏωSO. These substrates support stronger electron-phonon cou-
pling, which enhances the nonlinear interaction. In contrast, HfO2 again shows the weakest
absorption variation due to its low phonon energy, which limits the efficiency of polaron for-
mation. Overall, this panel reveals that even without an external electric field, the magnetic
field alone is sufficient to activate a strong nonlinear regime in the system, with a substantial
impact on the total optical absorption.
When an in-plane electric field of F = 0.3 V/nm is applied (see Figure 4(b)), the total
optical absorption spectra reveal a marked enhancement in both the depth and breadth of
the negative absorption region across all substrates. This amplification reflects the syner-
gistic action of electric and magnetic fields, which jointly increase charge carrier localization
and strengthen the electron-phonon interaction. As a result, the nonlinear absorption term
becomes even more dominant, and the absorption minima shift further toward higher photon
energies. SiO2 and SiC again exhibit the most intense response, confirming their superior
