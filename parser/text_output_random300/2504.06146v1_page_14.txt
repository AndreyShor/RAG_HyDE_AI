FIG. sm-2.
The symbols are the R´enyi−2 entanglement asymmetry for the charge Qy of each eigenstate of the Hamilto-
nian (sm-40) (left panel) and (sm-41) (right panel), with L = 14 sites and parameters g = 1.1, h = 0.35 and ∆= 2. We study
two different subsystems with length ℓA = 4 (blue points) and ℓA = 9 (green points). The energy density of the eigenstates ε
has been rescaled with ε∗= 1.35 (left panel) and ε∗= 1.33 (right panel), as explained in the main text. The black full line
is the analytical prediction (7) obtained for the ensemble of U(1)-symmetric random states with conserved charge orthogonal
to Qy. The blue and green shaded regions correspond to the confidence interval E[∆S(2)
A ] ± 3σ, where the variance σ has been
estimated numerically by sampling the ensemble of random states. The grey dashed line is the prediction (8) of the standard
Haar unitary ensemble, which should give an approximate prediction for only the mid-spectrum eigenstates.
