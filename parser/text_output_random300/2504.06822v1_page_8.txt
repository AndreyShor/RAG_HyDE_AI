data presented in Table V, the masses obtained for Ω
∗
ccc using the non-relativistic quark model [25, 32], are almost in alignment
with our predictions within the uncertainty range for the FTRs. The predictions made by the relativistic method [35, 36] for the
mentioned particle exhibit slight differences from our results in the 1S state and the 2S state, while they are fully in agreement
within the uncertainty range for the ﬁrst orbital excited state (1P). This comparison for Ω
∗
ccc using the Fadeev equation method
[39] shows some differences in the 1S state and the 1P state, where the difference for the 1P state is very small and also aligns
well with the ﬁrst radial excited state (2S). The prediction of the mass of Ω
∗
ccc in its ground state by the Regge trajectories [50] and
the effective Hamiltonian method [63] shows slight differences from our results within the uncertainty range. However, for the
ﬁrst orbital excited state, the results are fully consistent. Our results for the ground state of Ω
∗
ccc exhibit small differences when
compared to predictions made using the sum rule method [45, 47, 48] while it is in good consistency with the mass prediction
for the ﬁrst orbital excited state [45, 47]. Our obtained masses for the FTRs of Ω

ccb agree well with the theoretical estimates
from different frameworks such as the non- relativistic quark model approach [30], the relativistic quark model [35, 36], the
Faddeev equation [39] and the QCD sum rule method [47, 48] within the indicated uncertainties. Our ﬁndings regarding Ω

show a slight difference from predictions from approaches like the non- relativistic quark [25], the QCD sum rules [45], Regge
trajectories [50] and the effective Hamiltonian method [63] for the 1S and 1P states, while our obtained mass of the 2S state is in
excellent agreement with the mentioned theoretical predictions in Refs. [50, 63], within errors. The masses calculated for Ω
