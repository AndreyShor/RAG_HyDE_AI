Abstract
A novel fertility model based on Thom’s nonlinear differential equa-
tions of morphogenesis is presented, utilizing a three-dimensional catas-
trophe surface to capture the interaction between latent non-catastrophic
fertility factors and catastrophic shocks. The model incorporates key
socioeconomic and environmental variables and is applicable at macro-,
meso-, and micro-demographic levels, addressing global fertility declines,
regional population disparities, and micro-level phenomena such as
teenage pregnancies. This approach enables a comprehensive analysis of
reproductive health at aggregate, sub-national, and age-group-specific
levels. An agent-based model for teenage pregnancy is described to
illustrate how latent factors—such as education, contraceptive use, and
parental guidance—interact with catastrophic shocks like socioeconomic
deprivation, violence, and substance abuse. The bifurcation set anal-
ysis shows how minor shifts in socioeconomic conditions can lead to
significant changes in fertility rates, revealing critical points in fertility
transitions. By integrating Thom’s morphogenesis equations with tradi-
tional fertility theory, this paper proposes a groundbreaking approach
to understanding fertility dynamics, offering valuable insights for the
development of public health policies that address both stable fertility
patterns and abrupt demographic shifts.
