• |ǫ|11 = 0 where ǫ is the empty string;
• |abx|11 = |x|11 + 1 if ab = 11, |x|11 otherwise.
Burhman et al.’s protocol for bit commitment consists of repeating k
times the following commit/reveal scheme:
Bit-Commitment(c)
Commit
• Alice wants to commit to bit c. She constructs x ∈{0, 1}2n+1 by
randomly choosing the ﬁrst 2n bits and choosing the last bit such
that |x1 . . . x2n| + x2n+1 + c is even.
• Alice inputs the bits x1, . . . x2n+1 into the 2n + 1 PR-boxes. Let
a1, . . . , a2n+1 be the outputs.
• Alice computes A = L
i ai and sends it to Bob.
• Bob chooses a random string y ∈R {0, 1}2n+1 and inputs bits
y1, . . . , y2n+1 into his end of the 2n+1 PR-boxes. Let b1, . . . , b2n+1
be the outputs.
Reveal
• Alice sends c, x and b1, . . . , b2n+1 to Bob.
• Bob checks if ai ⊕bi = xi ·yi for 1 ≤i ≤2n+1 and |x1 . . . x2n|11 +
x2n+1 + c is even. If not, he accuses Alice of cheating.
Theorem 16. This protocol is secure against Alice. The best probability with
which Alice can change her mind is 1/2 + 1/2k−1.
This protocol is secure against Bob. The best probability with which Bob
can learn c before the reveal stage is 1/2 + k/2n+1.

Generalized Non-local Boxes
In this section we study a more general class of non-local boxes, where we
extend the set of inputs, the set of outputs, and the number of participants.
We also present some results on the connections between types of generalized
boxes.
