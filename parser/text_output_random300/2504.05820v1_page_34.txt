Scattering Protons
Starting from the NC structure functions, j ∈{γγ, γZ, Zγ, ZZ}, we find the following decom-

where we have normalized the structure functions such that they are always convolved with
xf(x) and for the averaged couplings are summed over all the active flavors. Lastly, we note
that FC11 diagrams are not symmetric (see Fig. 1.2 middle), thus when summing up all the
different electroweak channels in the NC case one has to consider the case j = γZ and j = Zγ
separately.
For CC, the combination W + + W −leads to diagrams which have the same topology as the
NC FC2. It is then convenient to categorize the coefficient functions for the combinations

while C−
i,ns are genuinely different. Eq. (1.85) originates from g, Σ and V being coupled
the same to W ±. In the W + + W −case, the CC structure functions have the same flavor
decomposition as Eqs. (1.81) and (1.82) with different couplings for up and down quark types;
while in W + −W −the parity conserving structure functions depends on d−
k and u−
k , and the
parity violating on d+
k and u+
k .
