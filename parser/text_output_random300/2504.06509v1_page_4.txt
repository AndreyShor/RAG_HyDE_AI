Fig. 1(a) illustrates the fundamental structure enabling the VCEC effect. The free and coupling 
layers, positioned beneath the barrier layer, are exchange-coupled via the spacer layer. Their 
relative alignment—either AP or P—can be controlled by applying a negative or positive 
voltage. It is well established that modulating the spacer layer thickness induces oscillatory 
coupling between the AP and P states39,40, a characteristic behavior of the Ruderman-Kittel-
Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. This effect can be similarly achieved by modifying the 
electrostatic potential of the barrier layer, shifting the relative energy of the AP and P states 
and enabling voltage-controlled switching33,34 (Supplementary Section 1). To investigate the 
effect, we deposited a multilayer stack on a SiO₂ substrate with the structure: 
Substrate/Ta(5)/Pd(3)/Co(0.3)/Pd(0.7)/Co(0.3)/Ru(0.6)/Ta(0.3)/CoFeB(1)/MgO(2.0)/CoFeB(
 
FIG. 1 | Properties of VCEC stack structure and patterned device. (a) Schematic illustration of voltage-
controlled exchange coupling (VCEC)-induced switching. The free layer is exchange-coupled to the coupling 
layer via the spacer layer, with the coupling strength modulated by an applied voltage. Under a positive 
voltage, the AP state is favored, while a negative voltage favors the P state. Due to the free layer’s lower 
coercivity compared to the coupling layer, only the free layer undergoes switching. (b) Schematic of the pMTJ 
stack structure incorporating an SAF free layer. The fixed layer, positioned above the MgO barrier, detects the 
free layer's magnetization direction through tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR). The top-right inset shows a 
patterned device with the top electrode adapted for measurement using a GSG probe. (c) Magnetization vs. 
perpendicular magnetic field loop of the stack after annealing. The sharp switching transitions indicate the 
presence of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in the free layer, coupling layer, and fixed layer. (d) 
Resistance vs. perpendicular magnetic field major loop of a patterned pMTJ device (500 nm diameter). The 
PMA remains, as evidenced by the distinct resistance states.
