In some Refs. [1, 5], a factor considering the impedance mismatch between the transmis-
sion line and the resonator, Z0/Zr, is multiplied to the expression above. However, since the
above derivation does not explicitly include the impedance, we do not consider impedance
difference explicitly in the following estimation of ⟨ncav⟩.
In Table S1, we summarize the resonance frequencies, the external quality factor, the
internal quality factor, and the number of photons for each mode based on the equations
introduced above. For the fit of the transmission signal from the actual device, we used
the function including the circuit asymmetry and the finite loss and phase delay in the
transmission line as [3]

where Ae−i(ωτ+α) corresponds to the damping and phase shifts in the transmission line, eiϕ
originates from the circuit asymmetry. According to Ref. [3], the external quality factor is
defined to be 1/Re(1/(Qext,real + iQext,imag)) and the internal quality factor can be expressed
as 1/Qint = 1/Qtot −Re(1/(Qext,real + iQext,imag)). It can be seen that the resonator used in
the experiment is in the overcoupled regime such that Qint > Qext. Thus, for the analysis
of the experimental data in the main text, we fitted only the region around the resonance
dip using the Lorentzian function, thereby obtaining a 3-dB bandwidth corresponding to
the internal quality factor. Although ±30% deviations in the absolute value of Qint are
observed between the fitting using Eq. (10) and the fitting using the Lorentzian function,
