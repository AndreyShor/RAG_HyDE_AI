Determining matrix and its singular vectors as symmetry generator coefficients
Let’s search for state-space symmetries, i.e., those where ξ(t, z) = 0.
In such case, the determining equations
become an infinite-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations
˙φℓp(t) =

where ℓ∈{1, ..., N} and p ∈ZN. One notices that it forms an infinite-dimensional linear system of equations and
that only the coefficients related to the monomials of the same total degree are dependent over one another. We
can thus treat the different total degrees separately. However, we can seek a specific symmetry generator that has a
finite number of nonzero coefficients (φℓp(t))ℓ,p. Consider that the nonzero coefficients are such that p is in a finite
subset P ⊂ZN including d := N · #P coefficients. For some ordering of (ℓ, p), the determining equations become an
overdetermined linear system of differential-algebraic equations described by
˙φ = M φ ,
(S91)
0 = N φ ,
(S92)
where we name M the differential determining matrix and N the algebraic determining matrix, as they entirely
determine the possibility of having a generator of symmetry or not. As one should expect, M and N solely depend
upon the elements of the complex weight matrix A. The differential determining matrix M is a d×d matrix, while N
is a r × r matrix where r is the number of equations such that ˙φℓp(t) = 0 for p /∈P. The algebraic equations appear
since there are shifts of coefficients in these determining equations that yield nonzero coefficients.
The solvability of Eqs (S91-S92) is questionable since it is generally strongly overdetermined. Yet, we know that
for a set P containing sufficient p’s of total degree one, there are at least two solutions (L0 and K). In fact, if ˙φ = 0,
then the following recurrence relations hold:

In matrix form,
D(A) φ = 0
(S94)
where D(A) is a m × d (m > d) complex rectangular matrix depending on the elements of a complex square matrix
A with imaginary diagonal and φ is a complex vector of dimension m × 1. Under what conditions on A does the
overdetermined system D(A) φ = 0 admit nontrivial solutions? The last equation means that the nullspace of D(A)
must have a dimension greater or equal to one (the nullspace always contains the null vector, but if it only contains
0, its dimension is 0). By the rank-nullity theorem [93],
dim(nullspace(D(A))) = N · #P −rank(D(A)) ,
and thus, in order to have a symmetry, the following inequality must be satisfied:
rank(D(A)) < N · #P .
In other words, the multiplicity of the zero singular value for D(A) must be greater or equal to 1. The singular vectors
associated with singular value 0 are the coefficients of the symmetry generator.

Proof of Theorem 3: Symmetry-generated constants of motion
Using diverse matrices A for N = 4 and N = 5, we performed symbolic and numerical calculations (see GitHub,
koopman-kuramoto/symbolic/symmetries) to obtain the associated determining matrices D(A), their singular value
decomposition and from the singular vectors with zero singular value, symmetry generators. In such way, we inferred
a class of symmetry generators that enable the creation of new constants of motion in the Kuramoto model on graph.
This subsection is devoted to the proof of Thm. 3 (Thm. S29) on these symmetry-generated constants of motion. To
that end, we first introduce a lemma that specifies the conditions (see Fig. (S5)) under which the Kuramoto model
admits such symmetry generators, along with their explicit form.
