matching segment of the virtual ship-track [23]. The age of the virtual ship-track seg-
ment is the time difference between the release of virtual emission parcel and MODIS
observation time.
Analyze cloud adjustments
Similar to Yuan et al. [7], we automatically find background pixels for each ship-
track segment. An example is shown in Figure 1. We consider the impact of overlap
between high and low clouds on the true low cloud fraction [7]. Only low cloud pixels
are included in calculating cloud properties. Nd is calculated using cloud retrievals of
Reff and COD [51]. For each segment, we calculate cloud changes using the means
of ship-track and background pixels.
Distributions of ∆L are known to be not normal and have many outliers [8]. ∆Nd
can be small in some of the segments. When calculating
dln L
dln Nd , the combination of
large ∆L and small ∆Nd can introduce outlier values. We try to remove top 5%
absolute values from calculated
dln L
dln Nd or use kernel density estimation method to
remove outliers before calculate the mean
dln L
dln Nd . We also try to adopt the method
used in previous studies (e.g., [8]) where we calculate mean ∆L and ∆Nd for a set of
samples and then determine dln L
dln Nd ≈dln L
dln Nd . Averaging ∆L first makes it less prone
to samples that have anomalously large values of ∆L
∆Nd .
