FIG. 7: 2D posterior distributions for thermal parameters and dark matter parameters for the two analysis shown in Figure 6. The analysis
shown are corrected for resolution, 𝑅𝑠cdm, a posteriori. The gray band represents the prior band imposed in the 𝑢0 −𝑇0 plane. Best-fit values
for the same data-sets are also shown shown in red ([109]), green ([62]), purple ([69]), and blue ([46]). In the middle row, we show the 2𝜎
upper limit on 𝑚WDM−1 from [46] slighly shifted to the right for illustrative purposes.
Finally, one can impose informed thermal priors through
measurements of the Thomson scattering optical depth, de-
noted as 𝜏CMB, derived from Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) data. This parameter offers a means to assess the IGM
thermal history by quantifying the integrated scattering rate of
photons by electrons over time, a quantity which is inherently
dependent on the electron number density [95]. Consequently,
for each thermal history model, there exists a mapping between
the integrated and instantaneous thermal history, which is pa-
rameterized by 𝑢0𝑧𝑖and 𝑇0𝑧𝑖, and the electron scattering opti-
cal depth. We use this mapping to interpolate 𝜏CMB for each
sampled combination (𝑢0𝑧𝑖, 𝑇0𝑧𝑖). At the likelihood level, we
introduce an additional Gaussian term for 𝜏CMB, centered on
𝜏CMB = 0.054 ± 0.007 as inferred by Planck [112]. While
the derived 𝜏CMB is heavily dependent on our simulated mod-
els, the prior effectively constrains the thermal parameters in
a manner that ensures the preferred cosmology is consistent
with CMB measurements of this parameter.
We find similar results to [46] in that the contour in the
(𝑢0 −𝑇0) plane for the default analysis expands along the
anti-correlation direction, with slightly colder models allowed
within 1𝜎at 𝑧= 4.2 and 4.6, as shown by the blue contours
in the upper row of Figure 7. This then results in a slight up-
ward shift in the (𝑢0 −𝑚WDM−1) plane in the middle row, with
colder models showing less pressure smoothing. The effect
of different thermal priors does not have a noticeable effect in
