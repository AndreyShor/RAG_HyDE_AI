Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk geome-
tries from boundary entanglement entropy data for ball-shaped entangling regions. By deriving
an explicit inversion formula, we relate variations in entanglement entropy to deviations of the
bulk metric about a fixed background. Applying this formula, we recover the Schwarzschild–AdS
spacetime in the low-temperature regime to first order. We further extend our analysis to include
deformations of the bulk geometry with nontrivial dependence on boundary directions, and propose
an iterative reconstruction scheme aimed at recovering the full spacetime starting close to a confor-
mal fixed point. We do this by building on recent advances in the mathematics of inverse problems
by introducing the higher-order linearization method as a new tool in the context of holographic
bulk reconstruction.
