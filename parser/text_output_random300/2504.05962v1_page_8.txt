 
pixels, calculated independently for each SP map, 
consistently appear in nearly the similar location (Figure 
3). This consistency suggests that these pixels represent 
a time-evolving feature within the AR, further 
supporting the potential of this region as the site for 
magnetic energy buildup. 
Regarding the reconstructed profiles of the h-RMSEV 
pixels (Figure 7), high fluctuations tend to appear on the 
blue side (0–20), indicating the model’s difficulty in 
predicting extreme shapes of the left lobes in the left line 
Figure 5. Detailed views of anomalous regions. Each panel (a–d) shows a focused RMSEV heatmap (top-left) 
highlighting a 3×3-pixel grid outlined in red, with the h-RMSEV pixel (the brightest pixel) positioned at the center. 
This grid corresponds to the numbered pixels in orange on the matching focused magnetogram (top-right), where only 
the h-RMSEV pixel is marked with a red cross. The spectral profiles at the bottom display the profiles of the pixels 
within the 3×3 grid, identified by the orange indices (including the h-RMSEV pixel marked with the red cross). In the 
pre-flare panels (a–c), the brightest pixels with the highest error are highly localized in the RMSEV heatmaps, making 
it extremely difficult to detect in the magnetograms. In contrast, in the during-flare panel (d), the brightest pixel 
shows a less noticeable error value, and the localized trend is more dispersed.
