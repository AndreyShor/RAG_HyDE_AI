where N( dt, dz) is a Poisson random measure with L´evy measure λνA( dz) dt, here νA is the density of a Gaussian
distribution with mean 0 and variance σ2. The values of the parameters selected are listed in Table I.
Figure 3 illustrates the temporal evolution of probability flows and probability density functions for Equation (S.32),
obtained via both the Monte Carlo simulation and the proposed numerical method. Specifically, the Monte Carlo
simulation employs the following Euler–Maruyama discretization scheme:

where ξt ∼N0,∆t where N0,∆t is a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance ∆t, N∆t ∼Po(λ∆t) is a Poisson
random variable with rate λ∆t, and Ak’s are i.i.d. random variables for jump sizes distributed as N0,σ2.
Fig. 4 shows the entropy production rates under different conditions on time interval [0,18]. When the mean jump
height of the active noise is zero, the system reaches an equilibrium steady state relatively quickly. However, when the
mean jump height increases to 0.1, non-equilibrium behavior becomes evident, and the time required for the system
to attain a non-equilibrium steady state is significantly prolonged compared to the zero-mean case (as shown in Fig.
5).
Example 2: An active Brownian particle cross-linked to a Rouse networked polymer
Our second example examines an active polymer system comprising an active Brownian particle (ABP) cross-linker
connected to ordinary Brownian beads, as shown in Fig. 6 (which is adapted from Ref. [S6]) .
