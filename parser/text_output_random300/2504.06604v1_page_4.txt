Figure 2: Workflow for 2D image registration within a 3D CT volume via optimization. The upper section represents the
process of applying rotations to the 3D CT scan, extracting a 2D slice, and computing similarity with the template image.
The lower section shows the differential evolution optimization process, which iteratively updates the transformation
parameters to minimize the objective function f, derived from the similarity evaluation in the upper section.
