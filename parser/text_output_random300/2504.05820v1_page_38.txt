contributions. Tagging a final state heavy quark is in principle not sufficient to disentangle the
heavy contributions from the massless ones.
1.4.2. Flavor Number Schemes
As mentioned in the previous section a fully massive DIS coefficient functions contains terms
O(m2
h/Q2) which are neglected in the massless case. In particular, these terms are relevant to
describe experimental measurements in the threshold region Q2 ≈m2
h, where the heavy quark
mass can be either charm or bottom. On the other hand in this scheme, the quasi-collinear
divergences of the heavy quark splitting generates terms ln(Q2/m2
h), which can become large
for Q2 ≫m2
h and are not resummed through the DGLAP evolution spoiling perturbation
convergence.
The choice of the number of active flavor nf and the heavy quarks thresholds µh at which a
heavy quark becomes active define a so-called flavor number scheme (FNS). In principle the
scale µh can be different from the actual quark mass, although it is common to set them to the
same value. Different FNS choices are possible depending upon the heavy quarks being treated
as light (µh = 0), heavy (µh finite) or decoupled (µh = ∞). We refer to the massive scheme
with nf active light flavor and one heavy quark as Fixed Flavor Number Scheme (henceforth
denoted by FFNSnf). To properly include massive effects, without spoiling the high-Q2 limit
we need to introduce a variable flavor number scheme (VFNS), which combines different FNS
depending on the considered scale.
Matching conditions.
Since all the anomalous dimensions associated to the running of
renormalized quantities depends explicitly on nf, when crossing a heavy quark threshold, there
can be discontinuities. In order to recover the proper transition between FNS one needs to
introduce matching conditions [92] connecting quantities in the nf + 1 scheme to nf one. Such
matching conditions can also be computed in perturbation theory and have to be included
consistently. Starting from the strong couplings as one finds the relation
