The scanning trigger frequency was set to 50 Hz, meaning the system scans each point every 
20 ms. Consequently, the excitation signal length for each scan point is also 20 ms, as illustrated 
by the mechanical excitation in Fig. 3. The main key to synchronization lies in the rest period 
within the excitation signal, where the amplitude drops to zero, allowing the imaging system 
sufficient time to switch scan points. The multi-frequency excitation signal was thus designed 
with an active period of 10 ms, followed by a 10 ms interval allocated for scan position 
adjustment via Galvo scanner tilting. This timing alignment ensures a stable scan for each 
position. The swept-source laser operates at a sweep rate of 20 kHz, resulting in an M-mode 
scan every 50 µs, which corresponds to 200 M-mode scans during the 10 ms period. However, 
only the central 100 M-mode scans are retained for elastography measurements to optimize 
data processing. The displacement field was obtained using the acquisition method and data 
postprocessing techniques developed by Zvietcovich et al. [34]. 
4.3 Sample preparation 
4.3.1 Gelatin phantom 
Four isotropic, homogeneous gelatin phantoms were prepared using standard methods [39]. 
Each phantom consisted of 5% gelatin powder (G1890-1KG, gelatin from porcine skin, Sigma-
Aldrich, MO, USA) to provide elastic properties, 3% intralipid powder for optical scattering, 
1% salt, and 91% water. The formulation and preparation method were specifically designed 
to ensure isotropic mechanical behavior, facilitating the investigation of multi-frequency shear 
wave elastography. 
4.3.2 Cornea 
Ex vivo porcine whole eye globe samples were sourced from a local slaughterhouse 
immediately after slaughter and kept under refrigerated conditions during transport. Upon 
arrival at the laboratory, the eye globes were immersed in a balanced salt solution (BSS). The 
samples were then allowed to reach room temperature before the experiments commenced. This 
preparation method ensured the preservation of the cornea's natural biomechanical properties. 
All experiments were conducted on the day of collection, using only intact eyes with 
undamaged corneas. Before placement in a custom-built holder, surrounding adipose and 
muscular tissues were carefully removed. To maintain an intraocular pressure of 15 mmHg, a 
needle connected to an intravenous fluid bag containing the BSS was inserted through the 
holder into the eye. To prevent dehydration, the eyes were irrigated with the saline solution at 
regular intervals. 
4.3.3 Liver 
A freshly harvested ex vivo bovine liver was obtained from a slaughterhouse immediately post-
slaughter and transported under refrigerated conditions. Small samples were excised from the 
liver for the MFR-OCE experiments. The samples were then brought to room temperature while 
submerged in saline solution to prevent tissue degeneration and dehydration. 
4.4 Generating the multi-frequency reverberant shear wave field 
To generate a reverberant shear wave field, two custom-designed multi-pronged rings with 
eight arms, arranged around central rings measuring 10 mm and 5 mm in diameter, were 
employed. The rings were gently placed on the samples to induce reverberant shear waves. In 
the MFR-OCE experiments on phantoms and porcine corneas, the field of view was set to 10 
mm × 10 mm, with 100 scan points in each direction across the sample. A smaller field of view 
(5 mm × 5 mm) and a smaller multi-pronged ring (the 5 mm ring) were used in the liver 
experiments due to higher shear wave attenuation in liver tissue. A multi-frequency excitation 
signal comprising five frequencies (i.e., 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 2500 Hz) 
was applied to the samples. To compare the multi-frequency results with single-frequency
