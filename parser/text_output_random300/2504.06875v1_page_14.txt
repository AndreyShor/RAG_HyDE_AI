1. Reliability of Peak Fitting 
Figure S1 shows different peak fitting models of the Sn 3d peak region, which are about equally consistent with the 
measured XPS data, but result in very different intensity ratios. The example illustrates that relying on a single emission 
peak for the calculation of quantitative depth information introduces large uncertainty to the data analysis. 
 
Figure S1. XPS core-level spectrum of Sn 3d3/2 and 3d5/2. The measured data is identical in all tiles but different line shapes 
and minimal background adjustments have been chosen to fit the data. GL(x) is the line shape of the Sn2+ peak and denotes 
a convolution of a Lorentzian and a Gaussian, where 𝑥 is the percentage of Lorentzian contribution. For the metallic Sn0 
peak different line shapes were chosen: DS(a,b) is a Doniach-Sunjic profile, for which 𝑎 is an asymmetry parameter and 𝑏 
defines the width of the Gaussian with which the function is convoluted. TLA(c,d,e) denotes an asymmetric Lorentzian with 
adjustable tail, with 𝑐 being an asymmetry parameter, 𝑑 dampens the asymmetric tail, and 𝑒 defines the width of the 
Gaussian with which the function is convoluted.
