where we used that time scales as 1/ωk ∼k−α.
Scale-invariant far-from-equilibrium states
So far, we have simply assumed that the state has power-law occupation numbers, nk ∼k−γ.
Let us now discuss how such a state can be achieved.
One possibility is the Rayleigh-Jeans
distribution, nk = T/ωk — the Bose-Einstein distribution at high temperature — discussed earlier,
see (2.19). There is, however, a richer and more interesting possibility.
One may pump energy into the system at some scale kIR. Due to nonlinearity, the energy
cascades into the UV, where it is absorbed at some scale kUV . This is referred to as a direct
cascade. Alternatively, one may pump in the UV, causing the wave action to cascade into the
IR — an inverse cascade. If one sets up kUV and kIR such that the interaction is weak at both
these scales, then one can analytically derive a stationary state, nk ∼k−γ, where the exponent
γ is determined by the parameters of the theory, see Appendix A. Specifically, for a direct or an
inverse cascade, the scaling exponent γ and the corresponding dimension of the interaction (3.7)
are, respectively,
Direct cascade ,
γ
=
d + 2
3β ,
D = β
3 −α
(3.8)
Inverse cascade ,
γ
=
d + 2
3β −α
3 ,
D = 1
3(β −2α) .
(3.9)
In the special case of a marginal interaction, D = 0, these become,
Direct cascade ,
γ
=
d + 2α ,
D = 0 ,
Inverse cascade ,
γ
=
d + α
D = 0 .

Let us now turn to computing the beta function in the case of marginal interactions. As we
implement renormalization group flow and integrate out the UV modes, the functional form of the
interaction λ1234 will in general change, already at one-loop level. We begin with a special form of
λ1234, which is preserved by the one-loop beta function.
3.1. Product factorized coupling
We take an interaction λ1234 that is a product of the magnitudes of the momenta [19,20],
ωk = kα ,
λ1234 = λ(p2

2p2
