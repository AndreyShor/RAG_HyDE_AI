5 MeV and it only decays to ΛcΞ′
c final states. Its rel-
atively narrow width implies that its resonance peak is
quite distinct, and the specific decay mode provides a
clear signature for experimental searches. Therefore, the
Hc2[nn][ns](5482, 1/2, 0+) has the potential to be discov-
ered in experiments. Further, we suggest the relevant ex-
periment check for the signal of Hc2[nn][ns](5482, 1/2, 0+)
in the 5400-5500 MeV energy window, and its lineshape
should be relatively prominent in ΛcΞ′
c mass spectrum.
In
addition,
the
Hc2[nn][ns](5487, 1/2, 1+)
and
Hc2[nn][ns](5261, 1/2, 0+)
are
also
relatively
narrow
states, with total widths of 16 and 19 MeV, respectively.
The Hc2[nn][ns](5261, 1/2, 0+) only decays to ΞcΛc final
states. For the Hc2[nn][ns](5487, 1/2, 1+), we obtain its
relative partial decay width ratios as:
Γ[Hc2[nn][ns](5487, 1/2, 1+) →Ξ∗
cΛc]
Γ[Hc2[nn][ns](5487, 1/2, 1+) →Ξ′cΛc] = 5

For the cc[ss][sn] subsystem, since it has exactly the
same symmetry constraints as cc[nn][ns] subsystem with
I = 3/2, the number of allowed states is also exactly
identical.
Due to the larger decay phase space and
multiple different decay channels, most of the states
belong to relatively broad states, with their decay widths
ranging from 35 to 100 MeV. Among them, there is a
relatively special state: Hc2[ss][sn](5806, 1/2, 2+), whose
total width is 27 MeV. Therefore, it is the narrowest
state in the cc[ss][sn] subsystem.
Moreover, it only
decays into the Ω∗
cΞc final states, which means there
is a high possibility of observing it in the Ω∗
cΞc decay
channel.
Based on the above research on the typical
states, and with reference to Table V and Fig. 4, one
can perform similar discussions on the decay behaviors
of other cc[ss][sn] states, and further explore their
characteristics in-depth.
C.
The cc[nn][ss] and cc[ns][ns] subsystems
Finally, we discuss the cc[nn][ss] and cc[ns][ns] subsys-
tems. These two subsystems both have the same quark
contents, same quantum numbers, and same mass range.
However, we can still distinguish them easily, because
their decay final states show obvious differences.
The
cc[nn][ss] states mainly decay to Σ(∗)
c Ω(∗)
c
and ΛcΩ(∗)
c
final states, with the Ξ(∗)
c Ξ(∗)
c
decay channel being ex-
tremely suppressed. In contrast, the decay behavior of
the cc[ns][ns] states is completely opposite to that of the
cc[nn][ss] states.
For isovector cc[nn][ss] states,
they are all rela-
tively broad states, with their total widths ranging
from 30 to 70 MeV. Then for the four I[JP ] = 1[1+]
states, three of them, namely Hc2[nn][ss](5811, 1, 1+),
Hc2[nn][ss](5810, 1, 1+), and Hc2[nn][ss](5809, 1, 1+), are
partner states with similar masses and widths.
Their
total widths are 60, 69, and 64 MeV, respectively, and
the mass gaps among them are only 1 MeV. We can dis-
tinguish them by the ratios of relative partial widths:
ΓΣ∗cΩ∗c : ΓΣ∗cΩc : ΓΣcΩ∗c : ΓΣcΩc = 6 : 1 : 14 : 33,
ΓΣ∗cΩ∗c : ΓΣ∗cΩc : ΓΣcΩ∗c : ΓΣcΩc = 1 : 2 : 23 : 0.3,
and
ΓΣ∗cΩ∗c : ΓΣ∗cΩc : ΓΣcΩ∗c : ΓΣcΩc = 22 : 1 : 35 : 1,
(31)
respectively.
From the above ratios, we notice that
ΣcΩc
channel
is
the
dominant
decay
channel
for
the Hc2[nn][ss](5811, 1, 1+).
In contrast, ΣcΩc chan-
nel is suppressed in the Hc2[nn][ss](5810, 1, 1+) and
Hc2[nn][ss](5809, 1, 1+). They mainly decay to ΣcΩ∗
c fi-
nal states and ΣcΩ∗
c, Σ∗
cΩ∗
c final states, respectively.
For isoscalar states,
there exists a narrow state,
Hc2[nn][ss](5586, 0, 0+). It has a total width of about 7
MeV and only decays to ΛcΩc final states. Although it
has a larger decay phase space, the signs of the Feyn-
man amplitudes M(A →BC) (Eq. (15)) from the four
quark-interchange diagrams (Fig.
2) are different for
the ΛcΩc decay channel. The contributions among them
largely cancel out, leading to the suppression of the decay
width. These characteristics, namely the narrow width
and the unique ΛcΩc-only decay mode, are highly desir-
able in experimental searches. They make the lineshape
of Hc2[nn][ss](5586, 0, 0+) more prominent in relevant ex-
periments, thus increasing the likelihood of its discov-
ery.
Therefore, we suggest that experiments prioritize
the search for possible resonance peaks in the 5500-5600
MeV range of the ΛcΩc invariant mass spectrum.
For
the
cc[ns][ns]
subsystem,
the
two
[ns]
di-
quarks need to satisfy the Spin-Statistics theorem
as identical particles in the |[(ns)I=1/2
s=1
(ns)I=1/2
s=1
](cc)⟩
and |[(ns)I=1/2
s=0
(ns)I=1/2
s=0
](cc)⟩configurations.
In the
|[(ns)I=1/2
s=0
(ns)I=1/2
s=1
](cc)⟩configuration, since the two di-
quarks are not identical particles, the constraints im-
posed on the color-spin wave functions for their coupling
to the I = 1 state and the I = 0 state are identical. As
a result, they have exactly the same masses, RMS radii,
and decay behaviors. Among them, Hc2[ns]2(5828, 1, 1+)
is the state with the narrowest width. Although it has
multiple rearrangement decay channels: Ξ∗
cΞ∗
c, Ξ∗
cΞ′
c, and
Ξ′
cΞ′
c, its total width is still less than 10 MeV. The partial
width ratio is:
ΓΞ∗cΞ∗c : ΓΞ∗cΞ′c : ΓΞ′cΞ′c = 1 : 2.5 : 0.3.
(32)
Our results show that Ξ∗
cΞ′
c is the dominant decay chan-
nel. We propose that future experimental investigations
could explore the presence of the signal corresponding to
Hc2[ns]2(5828, 1, 1+) within the mass range of 5800-5900
MeV in the Ξ∗
cΞ′
c final states.
For other cc[ns][ns]
states, one can perform similar discussions on the decay
behaviors according to Table VI and Fig. 5.
