IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
This paper introduced an equivalent circuit model (ECM) for
square-patch based metasurfaces loaded with tunable lumped ele-
ments. The ECM takes into account the physical dimensions of
the lumped loads and is extended to oblique and skewed plane of
incidence. A progressively more complicated family of unit cells,
labeled 1 × 1, 2 × 1, and 2 × 2, was studied. The 2 × 2 variant
allows for reconfigurable multifunctionality, dual/independent polar-
ized operation, and minimized intercell coupling for heterogeneously
configured metasurfaces. Comparing the developed ECM against full-
wave simulation, we found high accuracy, with resonance frequency
errors below 15%, provided that patch gaps remain much smaller than
the unit cell period and substrate thickness satisfies h/(√εrλ) ≫0.1.
This model effectively captures primary resonances, making it suit-
able for polarization conversion and anomalous reflection, though
secondary resonances require further refinement.
Practical implementations must consider finite apertures, where
physical optics can predict diffraction patterns, provided that nonlocal
effects are minimal. Additionally, the physical bulk of the lumped
elements placed on the metasurface aperture degrades performance
as the frequency increases, suggesting alternative configurations such
as placing elements behind the metasurface and using vias for
connectivity. The development of more advanced ECMs incorporating
these features, i.e., nonlocal effects and more intricate connectivity,
are important future steps stemming from this work.
APPENDIX
MUTUAL COUPLING IMPEDANCE
The coupling between the unloaded patch pair in the 2 × 1 unit
cell in Fig. 1(b) can be approximated by analyzing the grounded
slotline waveguide formed along the y-direction. When a plane
wave polarized perpendicularly to the patch-gap [x-axis in Fig. 1(b)]
obliquely illuminates the unit cell from above, it excites propagation
along the slotline which then resonates inside each cell in the y-
dimension. This transverse resonance contributes to the Zcpl term
which can be calculated as
Zcpl =
1
jωCm + jωLs.

The full model comprises a capacitance arising from the proximity
of the square patches, an inductance due to the interaction between
the patches and the ground plane, a resistance associated with metal
losses, and an admittance accounting for dielectric losses. To simplify
the ECM, the resistance can be neglected when PEC is used, and
dielectric losses can be incorporated into the effective permittivity.
The mutual capacitance Cm and self inductance Ls can be derived
using the methodology outlined in [23]. Given that the studied
metasurfaces satisfy constraints such as a narrow patch-gap and a
thin substrate, the formulas of [23] can be simplified by dropping
