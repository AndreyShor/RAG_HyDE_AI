• Using Hoeffding’s inequality similar as in Lemma IV.1, since

Using union bound, we know that for at least 1 −2(e−10 + e−12) ⩾1 −9.83 × 10−5 of all ⃗u ∈G, we must have:

where we used the fact that N ⩽2 × 16π

When ⃗u is not nice enough and our assumptions no longer hold we use a generous bound:
GN
⃗u |1⟩−eiN⟨⃗u,E[ ⃗X]⟩|1⟩

Combine Eqs. (117, 120, and 121) we obtain:
