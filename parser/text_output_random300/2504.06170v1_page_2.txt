(e.g., Dewangan et al. 2024a). The Galactic ‘Snake,’ an
infrared-dark cloud (IRDC) G11.11-0.12 illustrates this
phase, characterized by unperturbed filamentary struc-
tures and a compact central hub (Dewangan et al. 2024a;
Bhadari et al. 2024). In contrast, an evolved HFS rep-
resents a later stage in the HFS lifecycle, defined by ac-
tive feedback from massive stars. Mon R2 (RA(J2000)
= 06h07m46.2s, Dec(J2000) = −06◦23′8.′′3) serves as an
example of such an evolved HFS (Trevi˜no-Morales et al.
2019; Dewangan et al. 2024b). Although the early stages
of HFSs are important for understanding the initial con-
ditions of MSF, studies on such sites remain scarce in
the literature.
This study focuses on a large area encompassing the
mid-infrared (MIR) bubble N59 (Churchwell et al. 2006;
Deharveng et al. 2010; Hattori et al. 2016; Hanaoka et al.
2019) and its northern edge, known as N59-North (Chen
et al. 2024).
The bubble N59 is located toward the
Galactic coordinates (l, b) = (33.◦071, −0.◦075) and ex-
hibits a broken ring or shell-like structure in both molec-
ular line data and dust continnum emission (e.g., Paul-
son et al. 2024). Anderson & Bania (2009) estimated a
kinematic distance of 5.6±2 kpc for N59. However, using
Gaia parallax measurements (Gaia Collaboration et al.
2016, 2021), Paulson et al. (2024) refined this to a more
accurate distance of 4.66±0.70 kpc. It is important to
note that Gaia parallax measurements beyond 2 kpc lead
to systematic underestimation of distances depending
on the fractional parallax uncertainty. However, when
this uncertainty remains below 0.2, distance estimates
can still be considered reliable up to 10 kpc. More de-
tails about the distance estimates can be found in Gaia
data release 3 documentation. Paulson et al. (2024) se-
lected sources with fractional parallax uncertainties be-
low 0.1, ensuring a reliable distance estimate for this tar-
get site, which we adopt in this study. The N59-North
region contains several Class II 6.7 GHz methanol maser
emissions (MMEs) and ultracompact (UC) H ii regions,
which serve as the indicators of early stages of MSF
(e.g., Deharveng et al. 2010; Paulson et al. 2024). Us-
ing a multi-wavelength approach, Paulson et al. (2024)
identified a HFS candidate associated with N59-North.
However, additional studies are needed to validate the
existence of this proposed HFS candidate.
Using Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP)
12CO(J = 1–0) and 13CO(J = 1–0) line data, Chen
et al. (2024) reported multiple velocity components to-
ward the N59 bubble, specifically [65, 79], [79, 86], [86,
95], and [95, 108] km s−1 (see Figure 2 in their work).
Based on the detection of different velocity components,
they suggested that multiple collision events have oc-
curred among these velocity components over the past 2
Myr. However, the physical connections between these
velocity components and their respective distances are
not thoroughly addressed in their study. Among these,
the velocity component in the range of [95, 108] km
s−1 appears to correspond to the major cloud associated
with N59/N59-North, exhibiting a filamentary structure
(see Figure 6 in Chen et al. 2024). Despite the avail-
ability of extensive observational datasets and several
studies focusing on N59/N59-North, the full extent of
this filamentary structure remains unexplored, pointing
to physical processes that are yet to be fully investi-
gated. In Figure 1a, we highlight the extended IRDC,
visible in the Spitzer 8.0 µm image (indicated by ar-
rows), appearing as a filamentary structure in absorp-
tion. The locations of N59 and N59-North are also in-
dicated in Figure 1a (see also Chen et al. 2024). In gen-
eral, IRDCs are known to host dense, cold molecular gas
and dust that block infrared (IR) radiation from back-
ground sources. They are regarded as important sites
for studying the earliest phases of star formation, par-
ticularly in the context of MSF (e.g. Ragan et al. 2009,
and references therein). Interestingly, the IRDC host-
ing N59-North has not been the focus of any previous
studies. As a result, the formation and evolution of the
filament, along with its associated massive star-forming
activity, remain unexplored. In this study, we employ a
multi-wavelength observational approach to investigate
the physical environment and star formation processes
in the IRDC. We present a detailed kinematic analysis
of the structures embedded in the IRDC using 13CO(J
= 1–0), 13CO(J = 3–2), and NH3(1–1) line data.
The outline of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, we
describe the observational data sets utilized in this work.
The results derived from these data sets are detailed in
Section 3. The significance of these results related to
MSF in the IRDC is discussed in Section 4.
Finally,
Section 5 summarizes the key results and conclusions of
the study.
2. DATA SETS
In this paper, we utilized multi-wavelength archival
datasets (i.e., from near-infrared (NIR) to radio) as
listed in Table 1. The MAGPIS and SMGPS radio con-
tinuum data have rms noise levels (σ) of about 0.4 mJy
beam−1 and 20 µJy beam−1, respectively (Helfand et al.
2006; Goedhart et al. 2024). The 13CO(J = 1–0) line
data from the Boston University-Five College Radio As-
tronomy Observatory GRS are calibrated in the antenna
temperature (TA) scale. The σ(TA), velocity separation
between the channels, and angular resolution of the GRS
13CO(J = 1–0) line data are about 0.13 K, 0.21 km s−1,
and 46′′, respectively (see Jackson et al. 2006, for more
