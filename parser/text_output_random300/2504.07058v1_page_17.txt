3.1.1
1D linear Burgess equation
The linear term 𝑅(𝑥, 𝑡) characterizes the tumor’s progression in the absence of treatment [20,38]. Consider the
linear brain tumor growth model:
𝜕𝑢(𝑡, 𝑥)
𝜕𝑡
= 1
2
𝜕2𝑢(𝑡, 𝑥)
𝜕𝑥2
+ 𝑅(𝑡, 𝑥),
(3.1)
subject to the conditions:
𝑢(0, 𝑥) = 𝑒𝑥,
𝑢(𝑡, 0) = 𝑒𝑡,
𝑢(𝑡, 1) = 𝑒1+𝑡,
(3.2)
where
𝑅(𝑡, 𝑥) = 1
2𝑢(𝑡, 𝑥).
(3.3)
The exact solution is
𝑢(𝑡, 𝑥) = 𝑒𝑥+𝑡.

Figure 6 shows a graphical analysis of the exact solution alongside the approximate solutions derived from PINN
for the model given by Eq. (3.1). The results indicate that the PINN-based approximation closely aligns with the
exact solution, confirming the stability of PINN. Additionally, Fig. 6 illustrates the increasing tumor cell density
over time 𝑡. A three-dimensional graphical comparison between the PINN and exact solutions is provided in Fig. 7.
Table 2 displays the relative error E𝑟
𝐺and training error E𝑇alongside the selected hyper-parameters. A zoomed-in
view of the plot at 𝑡= 0.5 clearly shows that the PINN prediction is more accurate than the solutions obtained
using the Fibonacci and Haar wavelet methods [38].
