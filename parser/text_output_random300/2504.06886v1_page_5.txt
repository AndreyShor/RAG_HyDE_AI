the temperature fluctuations across different thermody-
namic regimes.
As the system transitions from HRG to QGP phase
with increasing temperature or the baryon chemical po-
tential, the heat capacity of QCD matter increases sub-
stantially. This implies that a tiny change of the tem-
perature would cost a huge amount of energy in the
regime of high temperature.
Therefore, the tempera-
ture tends not to change in comparison to the case in
the regime of low temperature.
In another word, the
temperature fluctuations would be suppressed remark-
ably as the matter evolves from the HRG phase to the
QGP phase with the increase of temperature or baryon
chemical potential, as demonstrated in our calculations.
The fact that temperature fluctuations at high tempera-
ture are smaller than those at low temperature leads to
another direct consequence, that is, a negative skewness
of temperature fluctuations. Such a signature emerges
because the increasingly narrow fluctuation distribution
at high temperature creates an asymmetric probability
density weighted toward lower temperatures. In the fu-
ture, temperature fluctuations represent a promising new
observable for probing the QCD phase diagram in high
baryon density regions, particularly through upcoming
experiments at FAIR-CBM, NICA, and HIAF.
