Abstract: 
 
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for studying complex molecular systems, but 
their high computational cost limits scalability. Coarse-grained (CG) models reduce this cost by simplifying 
the system, yet traditional approaches often fail to maintain dynamic consistency, compromising their 
reliability in kinetics-driven processes. Here, we introduce an adversarial training framework that aligns 
CG trajectory ensembles with all-atom (AA) reference dynamics, ensuring both thermodynamic and kinetic 
fidelity. Our method adapts the adversarial learning paradigm, combining a physics-based generator with a 
neural network discriminator that differentiates between AA and CG trajectories. By adversarially 
optimizing CG parameters, our approach eliminates the need for predefined kinetic features. Applied to 
liquid water, it accurately reproduces radial and angular distribution functions as well as dynamical mean 
squared displacement, even extrapolating long-timescale dynamics from short training trajectories. This 
framework offers a new approach for bottom-up CG modeling, offering a systematic and principled way to 
preserve dynamic consistency in complex coarse-grained molecular systems. 
 
I. Introduction 
 
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become a crucial tool in studying the behavior of 
complex molecular systems. However, the computational cost associated with all-atom (AA) simulations 
severely limits their ability to capture long timescales and large system sizes.1 To overcome these 
limitations, coarse-graining (CG) techniques have been widely adopted, systematically reducing the 
degrees of freedom while aiming to retain the essential properties of the system of interest. Bottom-up CG 
modeling, which derives effective interactions by learning from high-resolution AA simulation, has proven 
successful in applications ranging from lipid membrane to polymer self-assembly.2-6 Despite its success, a 
key challenge in any CG modeling remains: i.e., ensuring dynamic consistency, such that the CG model 
faithfully reproduces not only equilibrium properties but also the kinetics of the underlying atomistic 
system.4, 5, 7 This limitation hinders the application of CG methods to large-scale biomolecular processes 
where kinetics plays a critical role, such as the aggregation of misfolded proteins.8  
 
From the perspective of bottom-up CG modeling, projecting the AA dynamics into some reduced 
degrees of freedom (collective variables) brings more complicated interplay between these variables, 
raising the fundamental question of how to define the governing equation of motion for these variables. 
Several theoretical frameworks have been developed to answer this question, including the Mori-Zwanzig 
formalism,9, 10 which formulates projected dynamics with the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) form, 
and the effective dynamical formula,11 which describes the dynamics of collective variables when they 
sufficiently capture essential reaction mechanisms. While these frameworks elegantly formalize reduced 
dynamics, their practical implementation often faces challenges due to the need to compute intractable 
terms such as memory kernels or high-dimensional free energy landscapes. 
 
Building upon these theoretical foundations, numerical methods have been developed to construct 
dynamically consistent CG models. For example, an approach based on consistent Markov State Models 
has been developed in an attempt to enhance the kinetic fidelity of models.12, 13 In the work by Izvekov and 
Voth, friction coefficients were derived by approximating the thermal friction and interactions arising from 
eliminated degrees of freedom.4 Expanding on this concept, Davtyan et al. introduced the dynamic force
