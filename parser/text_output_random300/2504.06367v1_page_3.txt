simulations (resolution correction), inhomogeneous reioniza-
tion effects and a possible mis-estimation of instrumental noise
of the data.
The structure of this paper is as follows: In Section II, we
present the 1D Lyman-𝛼flux power spectrum measurements.
Section III introduces the hydrodynamical simulations, high-
lighting their key properties and the impact of CWDM on
the matter power spectrum. We also describe the synthetic
flux power spectrum models derived from these simulations.
Section IV details the emulator used for the MCMC analysis.
In Section V, we discuss various analysis choices, comparing
their effect on constraints on mixed dark matter models and ex-
ploring the degeneracy between the WDM parameters 𝑓WDM
and 𝑚WDM. Finally, Section VI summarizes our findings and
examines the implications of the allowed CWDM models for
the 𝑆8 tension.

DATA
We utilize the same dataset as presented in [46], specifically
the one-dimensional (1D) flux power spectra introduced in
[69]. These spectra were derived from a sample of 15 high-
resolution quasar observations conducted with the UVES and
HIRES spectrographs per averaged redshift bin, centered at
𝑧= 4.2, 4.6 and 5.0.
In particular, we analyze the power
spectra across 16 𝑘-bins, uniformly spaced by Δlog10(𝑘)=0.1,
from log10(𝑘/km−1 s) = -2.2 to log10(𝑘/km−1 s) = -0.7. The
measurements at these 𝑘-bins incorporate corrections for finite
spectral resolution and pixel size, as detailed in Appendix K
of [69]. These corrections were derived by applying the same
window function as in [69, 87, 88]. Furthermore, the non-
diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are adopted from
[46], which employed the same box size, 𝐿box, as in this work
to construct the bootstrap cross-correlation coefficient.
The velocity width corresponding to the smallest scale
probed in this dataset is approximately 30 km s−1, which is
significantly larger than the spectral resolutions of HIRES and
UVES, measured as 6 ≈km s−1 and 7 ≈km s−1, respectively.
These characteristics make it an ideal dataset to resolve the
small-scale features of the Lyman-𝛼forest. Prior studies have
used lower-resolution datasets with a larger number of QSO
samples (e.g., [60, 73]) or data from the same instruments but
with approximately half the number of quasar spectra (e.g.,
[88, 89]).
These studies have been limited to scales of up
to 𝑘≈0.1 s km−1. While such datasets have been effective
in constraining both the instantaneous thermal state and the
evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM), [69] extends this
reach to 𝑘max = 0.2 s km−1. Crucially, the high 𝑘-bins intro-
duced in this work are the ones sensitive to dark matter free-
streaming, allowing us to probe power suppression on scales
of 10–100 kpc. This extension to smaller scales is made pos-
sible by improved modeling of instrumental noise and metal
contaminants [69, 90, 91]. To account for these uncertainties,
we marginalize over these effects as part of our analysis.

SIMULATIONS
To probe CDM and pure warm dark matter WDM cosmolo-
gies, we use the same set of simulations from the Sherwood
project as employed in [46], incorporating the fiducial ultravio-
let (UV) background from [94]. These simulations feature sev-
eral advancements over previous models used in earlier studies
([58, 72]), including the implementation of a non-equilibrium
thermo-chemistry solver.
In this work, we expand upon the Sherwood simulations
framework by conducting additional simulation runs aimed
at constraining CWDM models detailed in Table I. The sim-
ulations are performed within a cosmological volume of 20
ℎ−1 Mpc, with 2×10243 dark matter and gas particles, which
provides sufficient resolution to capture the small-scale struc-
ture of the Lyman-𝛼forest ([46]) (see Subsection III C). Fur-
ther details regarding the simulations can be found in [46]
(Table I) and [95].
In Figure 1 we show the projected gas and dark matter
density fields extracted from simulation runs for CDM and
WDM cosmologies. One can see that the overdense regions in
the gas distribution, which serve as the seeds for the formation
of stars and galaxies, closely follow the distribution of dark
matter on large scales. The gas distribution at the small scales
appears more diffuse compared to the dark matter distribution
in the top-right panel due to the pressure smoothing effect: the
gas hydrodynamically reacts to heating from reionization by
expanding, suppressing small-scale structure [94]. The neutral
hydrogen, which is responsible for the Lyman-𝛼absorption,
resides in these filaments or voids. The bottom two panels
