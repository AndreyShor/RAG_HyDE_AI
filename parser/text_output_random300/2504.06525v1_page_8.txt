Such conclusion is further supported by the predicted distribution of the three rewards shown 
in Figure 3g-i. The reward of phase in Figure 3i shows broader maxima compared to the other two 
rewards, agreeing with our conclusion from Pareto front analysis that the reward of phase is less 
selective due to the lack of step edge pixels in the calibration grating sample. Notably, the maxima 
of the height difference reward (Figure 3g) and the phase reward (Figure 3i) are in closer proximity 
within the parameter space, whereas the optimal solution for the tip-sample distance reward 
(Figure 3h) is located in a different region under the selected I gain parameter. This spatial 
separation reinforces the observed trade-offs in the MOBO process. 
Finally, Figure 3d-f presents three representative trace and retrace scan lines of height and 
phase, with their corresponding control parameters (Figure 2e) and reward values (Figure 3g-i) 
highlighted by arrows in matching colors.
