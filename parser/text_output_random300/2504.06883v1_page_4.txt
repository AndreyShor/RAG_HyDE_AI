(2)
for s(k) := sk, in terms of the spin variable at site k, k = 1, . . . , S + 1, and with periodic
boundary conditions, s(2S + 1) ≡s(1), s(2S + 2) ≡s(2). Here, we first group the left- and
right-moving spin variables together, and then rename them sL and sR, respectively, and
renumber the even- and odd-numbered sites.
Considering, for example, the evolution generated by ˆU of Equation (A7) in l steps,
the update of a generic state |ψn⟩at time t = nT is exactly described by a pair of equations:
sL
n+l(k) −sL
n(k)
=
sL
n(k + l) −sL
n(k),
(3)
sR
n+l(k) −sR
n (k)
=
sR
n (k −l) −sR
n (k),
(4)
where suitable identical terms were subtracted on both sides of Equations [23,24].
Then, for l = 1, Equations (3) and (4) simply represent discretized first-order partial
differential equations in 1 + 1 dimensions. Remarkably, the left- and right-movers do not
interact and up-and-down spins are never flipped here. – Identical equations hold for the
block numbers introduced in Equation (A9) in Appendix A.2.
Jumping to the continuum limit, we introduce linear combinations S± := sL ± sR and
¯σ0 := 12, ¯σ1 := −σx with unit matrix 12 and Pauli matrix σx. Thus, the Equations (3) and (4)
can be combined and yield the left-handed Weyl equation:
¯σµ∂µΨL = (12∂t −σx∂x)ΨL = 0,
(5)
for the two-component ‘spinor’ (ΨL)t := (S+, S−)—the right-handed Weyl equation, with
σ0 := 12, σ1 := +σx, and (ΨR)t := (S+, S−),
σµ∂µΨR = (12∂t + σx∂x)ΨR = 0,
(6)
is obtained similarly, especially replacing ∂x
→
−∂x in the derivation following
Equations (3) and (4), which amounts to an additional overall minus sign on the right-
hand sides of both equations or exchanging left- and right-movers there. In turn, this is
equivalent to numbering the sites of the spin chain from right to left instead of from left to
right, as before.
The continuum limit can be studied in a controlled way, for example, by applying
Sampling Theory, similarly as in references [7,25–27]. This maps the above finite differences
equations one-to-one on continuous space-time partial differential equations for bandwidth-
limited fields sL(x, t) and sR(x, t), i.e., continuum equations for functions with an ultraviolet
cut-off corresponding to a nonzero scale T. There arise higher-order derivative terms
from expanding exp(T∂t) or exp(T∂x) (c = 1), which disappear for T →0. – Note that on
discrete lattice points, the functions sL,R(x, t) can only assume the Ising spin values sk = ±1,
while they can be real-valued in between. This limitation is overcome by assuming block
numbers as underlying discrete variables which, by construction, range over a larger set of
non-negative integers; see Appendix A.2.
Obviously, there are no mass terms in the Weyl equation. However, in reference [24],
we showed that the implied signal velocity can be changed to differ from c = 1 by modifying
the update rule in simple ways. Nevertheless, this does not correspond to introducing a
mass, as will be needed for the Dirac equation, cf. the following Section 2.2.
