Two-dimensional Illusion Space: both
virtual size and angle incongruent
For the 3cm-8°, 6cm-8°, 9cm-8° and 6cm-16° physical objects, the
thresholds and PSE of size and angle perception are plotted in Fig.
7 and we fitted them with linear functions:
𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑘𝑥+ 𝑏
(3)
where k is the slope and b is the intercept of the fitted line.
The horizontal axis is the size incongruence (virtual size/physical
size) and the vertical axis is the angle incongruence (virtual an-
gle/physical angle). Within the quadrilateral formed by the upscal-
ing thresholds and downscaling thresholds of the size and angle
perceptions, the illusion of VR works and it’s considered difficult
for the users to notice the differences between the physical proxies
and the virtual objects. Therefore, we define the quadrilateral as
the two-dimensional illusion space of perception in VR.

Three-dimensional Illusion Space: how the
perception changes with physical properties
When we add a third dimension (i.e. physical size or physical angle)
as shown in Fig. 8a and Fig. 8b, the figures show the trends of how
illusion spaces a physical object can render change with its physical
properties. According to our results, we assume the size upscaling
threshold (SUT), the size downscaling threshold (SDT), the angle
upscaling threshold (AUT) and the angle downscaling threshold
(ADT) can be fitted in straight lines and the quadrilateral formed
by the four threshold lines is the illusion space for each physical
object. Therefore, the illusion space can also be expressed via four
vertices (crossing points of the size and angle perception thresholds),
namely 𝑉𝑆𝑈𝑇×𝐴𝑈𝑇,𝑉𝑆𝐷𝑇×𝐴𝑈𝑇,𝑉𝑆𝑈𝑇×𝐴𝐷𝑇,𝑉𝑆𝐷𝑇×𝐴𝐷𝑇. By fitting
the same vertex for different physical sizes/angles in a 3D line, we
can obtain the mathematical description of how the vertices change
with physical sizes/angles, as plotted in Fig. 8a and Fig. 8b.
The 3D line can be expressed as:
𝐿(𝑡) = 𝑃0 + 𝑑· 𝑡
(4)
where 𝐿(𝑡) is a point on the line for a given parameter 𝑡, 𝑃0 is a
point on the line, typically the centroid of the points for the fit, 𝑑
is the direction vector for the line and 𝑡is a scalar parameter that
varies along the line. Therefore, for physical objects 3cm-8°, 6cm-8°
and 9cm-8° with different physical sizes, we fitted four lines for the
vertices 𝐿𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒
𝑆𝑈𝑇×𝐴𝑈𝑇, 𝐿𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒
𝑆𝐷𝑇×𝐴𝑈𝑇, 𝐿𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒
𝑆𝑈𝑇×𝐴𝐷𝑇and 𝐿𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒
𝑆𝐷𝑇×𝐴𝐷𝑇.
