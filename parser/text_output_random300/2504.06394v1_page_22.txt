Figure 10: Analytical reconstruction of vortical flow in the utricle as the maximum
channel radius, 𝑎𝑚, increases. The channel has a largely uniform radius but is wider in the
vicinity of the utricle — see (6.1) for the detailed profile of the tube. Here, we observe
how as the size of the utricle is augmented the vortex develops. The forcing is given by
(3.19) and we show the solution at time 𝑡= 0.25. The parameters used are 𝜖= 0.05, and
𝜅= 0.1. Furthermore we use the solution from § 3 that assumes the fluid inertia is
vanishingly small, St = 0.
the solution at time 𝑡= 0.25. Here we have used a small value of 𝜅= 0.1 so that the flow
in the slender regions is predicted to remain largely symmetric, a feature that we will verify
below.
6.1. Conditions required for the formation of the utricular vortex
As noted above, symmetry breaking in the utricle occurs when the first order correction 𝜖𝑤1
is comparable with the leading order velocity 𝑤0. Within a cross section, the maximum value
of 𝑤0 is attained at 𝑟= 0, and is given by

The transition can be seen qualitatively in the left panel of Figure 10, where the flow in
the utricle (left half of the torus) transitions from symmetric to asymmetric as the bulge is
increased. In Figure 11 this transition is analysed quantitatively. In the left panel, the flow
profile in the utricle is plotted for varying 𝑎𝑚. Observe that for large 𝑎𝑚, the flow utricle
flow is asymmetric while the flow in the slender part of the canal remains symmetric. To
quantify the transition to noticeably asymmetrical flow, we compute the correlation between
