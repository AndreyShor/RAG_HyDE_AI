BACKGROUND AND OUR WORKFLOW
A.
The BeH2 insertion problem
We consider the BeH2 insertion problem [31], and in par-
ticular the following geometry: the Cartesian coordinates
for the two hydrogen atoms is specified as: (x = 0.000, y =
±1.275 and z = 2.750), with the units given in Bohr. The
Be atom is placed at the origin. We work with the STO-6G
basis, and use the C2v point group symmetry in our compu-
tations. Our choice for the geometry corresponds to a point
along the well-studied Be + H2 reaction pathway, specifi-
cally an avoided crossing where multireference effects are
pronounced, and where the single reference unitary coupled
cluster ansatz would not yield good quality results, thus ne-
cessitating the use of a multireference coupled cluster treat-
ment [30].
B.
MRUCC-VQE framework
We begin with a brief description of the VQE algo-
rithm, followed by a discussion on our choice of MRUCC
ansatz.
The VQE algorithm is a quantum-classical hy-
brid approach that relies on the Rayleigh-Ritz variational
principle
[32]. The algorithm involves minimizing an en-
ergy functional E(⃗θ) = ⟨Ψ(⃗θ)| ˆ
H|Ψ(⃗θ)⟩
⟨Ψ(⃗θ)|Ψ(⃗θ)⟩
= ⟨Φ| ˆU †(⃗θ) ˆH ˆU(⃗θ)|Φ⟩
with respect to the parameters {⃗θ} via an iterative pro-
cedure, where by starting with an initial guess for the
parameters, one updates them at each iteration using an
optimizer routine.
The parameter update step is carried
out on a classical computer whereas the energy functional
evaluation for each iteration is done on a quantum com-
puter (see Figure 1(a) for a schematic describing the algo-
rithm) [12]. Here, ˆH is the molecular Hamiltonian given by

q ˆas ˆar in the second quan-
tized form, where hpq and hpqrs are the one- and two-
electron integrals, while p, q, · · · denote spin-orbital indices
(occupied and unoccupied). |Ψ(⃗θ)⟩is the molecular wave
function, and is expressed as a unitary ˆU(⃗θ) acting on a
reference state |Φ⟩. We choose the following ansatz for this
work:
ˆU(⃗θ) |Φ⟩= eˆ˜τ |Φ⟩= eˆ˜τ P
i Ci |Φi⟩.
In the above
expression, the reference state has been expanded as a lin-
ear combination of determinants. ˆ˜τ is built out of linearly
independent excitations. It is necessary to use this opera-
tor on the exponent in place of the standard UCC operator,
ˆτ = ˆT −ˆT †; ˆT = ˆT1+ ˆT2+· · ·+ ˆTN (where ˆT1 = P

bˆaiˆaj, etc; the t-amplitudes are the pa-
rameters out of which ⃗θ is built), in order to ensure that
there are no redundancies. Redundancies occur when an
excitation operator’s action on a determinant from the set
{|Φi⟩} and another excitation operator’s action on another
such determinant lead to the same output determinant. In
this work, we manually remove the redundancies, and in a
future work, we plan to replace the manual process with a
theoretical framework that accounts for redundancies, such
as the internally contracted MRUCC [33].
Having introduced the MRUCC framework in which we
plan to carry out our 12-qubit VQE computations (which
corresponds to a 12-spin-orbital calculation; we freeze the
innermost molecular orbital), we now briefly comment on
how the circuit is executed. The expression presented in
the previous paragraph for the state, |Ψ(⃗θ)⟩, is recast into
its quantum circuit form by using Jordan-Wigner transfor-
mation [34, 35], to convert fermionic operators into qubit
operators, followed by Trotterization and finally applying
Pauli gadgets (for example, see Refs.[36, 37]). The coeffi-
cients Ci are obtained from classical pre-processing, as are
the one- and two-body integrals that occur in the Hamil-
tonian.
For our work, the coefficients for the two refer-
ence determinants considered (|220000⟩(the Hartree-Fock
(HF) determinant) and |202000⟩(determinant generated by
a double excitation from the highest occupied molecular or-
bital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO))), where each entry in a ket denotes the occupancy
