No-scale supergravity
VG, VF and VD all depend non-trivially on t. Constant W, constant f and
the (−2) factor multiplying the logarithm in K are essential in ensuring that
all three terms in (1.12) have the same t-dependence. In particular, for
|W0| =
√
2 eg ,
(1.13)
there is an exact cancellation and V0 = VG + VF + VD = 0. The gauge
symmetry and supersymmetry are broken on Minkowski space at all classical
vacua, with the would-be Goldstone boson and fermion given by τ and by
a linear combination of eT and λ, respectively. The only classically massless
particle is the real scalar t, all the other particles in the physical spectrum
have squared masses proportional to m2
3/2 = eg2/(2 t2). Superficially, we may
think that the choice of (1.13) is a fine-tuning, but it can be shown [16] that
such term can be originated by a consistent N = 1 truncation of a N = 2
model with a single gauge interaction. Similarly to the model in [5], also this
model can be straightforwardly generalised to include additional vector and
chiral multiplets, with gauge group ]
U(1) × G, as long as the latter do not
transform under the original ]
U(1).
If m3/2 and mW are both to be dynamically determined by dimensional
transmutation, irrespectively of their ratio, we may ask whether there are
no-scale models where supersymmetry and the electroweak gauge symmetry
are both spontaneously broken, with a positive semidefinite classical poten-
tial and both scales sliding along classically flat directions in field space. The
answer is positive, and some examples have been given in [17, 18, 19]. We
briefly describe here, for illustration, the model introduced in [19], which
extends the one in [16] and has only two real classical flat directions, in one-
to-one correspondence with the scales of supersymmetry and electroweak
symmetry breaking. In short, the model couples the hidden sector of [16] to
the electroweak gauge and Higgs sector of the MSSM. The gauge group is
SU(2)L ×U(1)Y × ]
U(1). The chiral multiplets are the SM-singlet T ∼(T, eT)
and the two MSSM Higgs doublets, H1 ∼(H1, eH1) and H2 ∼(H2, eH2). Un-
der ]
U(1), the imaginary part of T shifts as before, whilst the two Higgs
superfields do not transform. Motivated by string compactifications and
by extended supergravities, we choose the Kähler manifold for the scalar
fields (unifying the chiral multiplets in the hidden and Higgs sectors) to be
SO(2, 5)/[SO(2) × SO(5)]:
