where Rs,0
I
is the value of the section at the base point corresponding to the equilibrium molecular shape Qs,0,
with the latter defined as the base point projection from a suitable minimum of the PES. This encodes
the choice of orientation when the nuclear coordinates are at equilibrium. The Eckart frame is specified
everywhere once a choice of Rs,0
I
is made. Often, this equilibrium reference orientation is taken to be a
principal axis frame for the equilibrium shape, i.e., a frame which diagonalizes the moment of inertia tensor
at equilibrium. This is the choice we make in this work. The Eckart section is not, in general, perpendicular
to the fibers, except at the equilibrium base point. This means that, in general, the rotational-vibrational
coupling vanishes only at equilibrium. However, if the molecule is semi-rigid, as is typically the case, and
we do not depart too much from the equilibrium shape, these couplings will be small. This is the scenario
we envision for all the species at t = 0. Capitalizing on this, we further ignore the rotational-vibrational
coupling terms to obtain the rigid-rotor Hamiltonian,17 displaying the desired separation of translations,
rotations, and vibrations:18

17See Eq. (5.68) in Ref. [74] for the fully coupled rotational-vibrational Hamiltonian in Eckart gauge. We ignore all rovi-
brational coupling terms involving the variable K and also the so-called “Watson term” V2(q). The error in the rovibrational
decoupling is often only of the order of a few percent in practice (see Sec. 14.5 in [70]). Finally, we approximate the inverse
inertia tensor to leading order in the displacement around equilibrium as the inverse of the equilibrium inertia tensor. As we
discussed earlier, with our choice of Rs,0
I
, the moment of inertia tensor is a diagonal matrix. This leads to the rigid-rotor
Hamiltonian given below, which is constructed in the Eckart frame and so is a gauge-dependent approximation of the full
rovibrational Hamiltonian. The full gauge-invariant rovibrational Hamiltonian is given in Eq. (4.146) in Ref. [74].
18Here and below, we show the DoF count for the general non-linear molecule case but note the DoF counts are straightfor-
wardly different for linear molecules, periodic substrates, and isolated atoms as discussed earlier.
