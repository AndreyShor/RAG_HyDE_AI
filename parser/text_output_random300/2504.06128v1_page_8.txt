Log-normality was first proved in [CSZ17, Theorem 2.8] for Zβ
Npxq :“ Zβ
Np1txuq, i.e. the
partition function started at a single point x (also called point-to-plane partition function),
when β “ βsub-crit

is chosen in the sub-critical regime:

Our proof of Theorem 1.8 also covers this regime and allows for averaging over balls of
arbitrary sub-diffusive polynomial radius N γ{2`op1q as N Ñ 8, for any 0 ď γ ă 1. The few
changes required are described in Remarks 4.6 and 4.8 (see also Remark 2.6).

and, furthermore, all positive moments converge.
Alternative proofs of the log-normality of the point-to-plane partition function in the
sub-critical regime were given in [CC22] and, more recently, in [CD24], simplifying the
original approach in [CSZ17, Theorem 2.8]. A key ingredient in all of these proofs is the
identification of suitable exponential time scales which yield an approximate factorisation of
the partition function.
Remarkably, a similar structure also emerges in the quasi-critical regime (1.22) when the
partition function is averaged on scales δϱ

N, for any power ϱ, with δN as in (1.24). This
key fact is at the core of our proof of Theorem 1.8 (see Section 4 for more details).
Remark 1.10 (Quasi-critical vs. sub-critical regime). Comparing (1.25) with (1.27)
for γ “ 0, we can draw an analogy between the following two quantities:

More precisely, if we divide space into squares of side length δϱ
N
?
N and time into intervals of
size pδϱ
Nq2N, we can view the quasi-critical model Zquasi-crit
N
as effectively a sub-critical model
Zsub-crit
L
with rescaled time horizon L « 1{pδϱ
Nq2 and effective disorder strength ˆβ2 “
ϱ
1`ϱ.
This analogy is made quantitative by our strategy of proof for Theorem 1.8, described in
Section 4. This suggests that, at a conceptual level, other results that hold in the sub-critical
regime could be transferred to the quasi-critical regime via this correspondence.
We stress, however, that the quasi-critical regime (1.22) presents a fundamental technical
challenge: unlike in the sub-critical regime, the main contribution to the polynomial chaos
expansion of the partition function now comes from chaos of unbounded order (see the proofs
of Proposition 2.3 and Theorem 2.5). As a consequence, many fundamental tools break down
(e.g., hypercontractivity) and novel arguments are required.
