In the paper, we consider a supersymmetric (SUSY) extension of the type II 2HDM – the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [18] – according to which each SM degree of
freedom is associated with a superpartner. As far as no evidence of new particles is observed,
we suppose that all SUSY partners are heavy, so the Higgs boson phenomenology at low scale
is very similar to that of a type-II 2HDM. The current experimental constraints on the masses
of SUSY particles and neutral Higgs bosons are MSUSY > 2.3 TeV and mH,A > 1121 GeV for
tan β = 10 (and larger for tan β > 10) [4]. The mass limit for mH± < mtop is mH± > 155 GeV,
in case of mH± > mtop it is mH± > 181 GeV for tan β = 10 (and larger for tan β > 10) [4]. At
the same time, the observed deviations in Run 1 and Run 2 at the LHC at an invariant mass of
28 GeV (in a dimuon channel) [19] or 95 GeV (in channels γγ, ττ, bb) [20] could be a sign of
additional Higgs scalars.
In this work, we consider the Higgs sector of the type II 2HDM and the MSSM with explicit
CP-violation and analyze the alignment limit conditions under the assumption that the observed
Higgs boson is a neutral scalar with indeﬁnite CP-parity h1 or h2 or h3. In this framework, the
possibility of interpretation of the diphoton 95 GeV excess [16, 21, 22] (see, however, [23]) as
a possible neutral scalar hi-decay is investigated. We propose benchmark scenarios and discuss
some phenomenological features relevant for future LHC searches.
Note that in the scenario which is considered below the eﬀective ﬁeld theory at the electroweak
scale is the 2HDM, so MA mass scale is of the order of mtop and orders of magnitude below the
scale of Higgs superﬁeld mass parameter µ and the superpartners mass scale MS, the latter are
insigniﬁcantly diﬀerent. Other interesting scenarios have been considered in the literature, for
example, the location of the MA between mtop and (MS, µ), when the eﬀective theory above MA
is the 2HDM, below MA is standard-like, see [24, 25]. The eﬀects of new physics including those
from explicit CP violation decouple from the light Higgs boson sector, so these interesting cases
demonstrate diﬀerent phenomenology of the heavy Higgs bosons.

Radiative corrections to the Higgs sector of the type-II
2HDM and the MSSM
The MSSM Higgs boson mass spectrum and mixing of scalars for the eﬀective renormalization
group improved potential where the tree-level CP invariance is broken explicitly by Yukawa in-
teractions related to the third generation squarks was ﬁrst analyzed in [26]. Tree-level couplings
of neutral Higgs bosons may be signiﬁcantly altered by strong mixing with multiple phenomeno-
logical consequences. In such a framework two doublets Φ1 and Φ2 of the Higgs sector with
vacuum expectations values (VEVs) v1 and v2 (v2 = v2
