prescription. Prescription (b) will be adopted in all the fits, whether LO, NLO or NNLO, that
we will call with MHOUs in Section 5.3. This nomenclature puts the emphasis on the fact that
MHOUs, beyond the nominal accuracy of the fit, are included on all data points. Be that as
it may, we have checked that MHOUs are generally smaller than experimental uncertainties,
and that they are significantly more correlated. From Fig. 5.2 we can also appreciate how the
NNLO MHOU correlations are generally smaller that the NLO ones, indicating a consistent
perturbative convergence of theoretical predictions.
5.2. Methodology
In this section, we discuss the methodology deployed to determine the NNPDFPOL2.0 parton
set. The methodology, based on parametric regression, closely follows the one laid out in [109,
324] for the determination of the NNPDF4.0 set of unpolarized PDFs. We review how aspects
of PDF parametrization, optimization, and hyperoptimization are upgraded and adapted to the
polarized case.
5.2.1. Parametrization
Parton distribution parametrization entails two choices: first, a choice of parametrization basis,
that is, the set of linearly independent distributions that are parametrized; second, a choice of
parametrization form, that is, the function that maps the parameters into the elements of the
basis. Concerning the parametrization basis, we choose the set of functions
