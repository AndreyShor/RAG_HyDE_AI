IV. Combined loss 
The final loss function combines all these components with adjustable weights (𝑤𝑎𝑚𝑝, 𝑤𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦, and 
𝑤𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒) that represent their relative physical significance:  
𝐿𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙= (𝑤𝑎𝑚𝑝× 𝐿𝑎𝑚𝑝) + (𝑤𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦× 𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦) + (𝑤𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒× 𝐿𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒)

This physics-constrained loss function enables the neural network to capture the complex, non-linear 
relationships between structural parameters and optical response while ensuring physical 
consistency.  
3. Results and Discussion 
Naturally, due to the imbalanced datasets and the presence of regions with different behaviors, we 
may hypothesize that specialized approaches would be necessary. These could include either 
specialized weighting strategies—adjusting each region's contribution to the loss function—or 
separate architectural branches for different data regimes. Our analyses, however, revealed that our 
physics-informed architecture is sufficiently robust to handle both gap regimes effectively with 
uniform weighting. This suggests that incorporating physical laws directly into the model architecture 
provides a space where the model can learn different regimes with equal emphasis. Instead of 
applying standard techniques like oversampling or class weighting [53,54] that mainly address 
statistical imbalances in dataset, or creating complex multi-branch architectures to handle different 
physical behaviors, the physics-constrained architecture can naturally capture the various physical 
behaviors with a simpler, unified approach. 
Our neural network was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. For both Dataset A and Dataset B, 
the model randomly splits samples into training (70%), validation (20%), and test (10%). Compared to 
fixed dataset divisions, this random splitting approach more effectively demonstrates the model’s 
ability to generalize rather than merely memorizing specific data points. Figure III shows how the 
various loss components evolve during training for both training and validation datasets. The 
amplitude loss quickly converges (Figure III-a), indicating that the model immediately learns amplitude 
prediction task. It is not a surprising result, because most of amplitude values in the dataset are above 
0.9 (due to the material and light wavelength used for the metasurface) making the amplitude 
prediction relatively straightforward. However, amplitude predictions are still important as we can 
consider them as an important validation confirming the fundamental predictive capabilities of the 
model before addressing the challenging phase prediction task. While the energy conservation loss 
plays a key role in our framework, we observe its rapid convergence to zero even in the earliest 
training epochs (see top diagram in Figure III-b). This behavior shows a key advantage of the physics-
