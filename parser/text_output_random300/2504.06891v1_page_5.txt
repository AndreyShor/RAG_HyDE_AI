transport of chemical elements, the equation of state or radiative opacities22;23. The latter were
quickly identiﬁed as a potential source of the disagreements24;25;26, either due to abundance revi-
sions27;28 or inaccuracies in opacity computations. A revision of the solar neon abundance was
recently determined29;30, but is insufﬁcient in reconciling the low metallicity standard models
with helioseismic constraints. Magg et al. (2022)31 claimed to solve the problem by restoring
the agreement between solar models and helioseismic data achieved in the 1990s with revised
abundances derived from averaged 3D atmosphere models. However, their solar models neglect
rotation and light element depletion32 as well as the latest opacity tables published in 2015 and
201633;34. The oxygen revision they propose has also been recently questioned35 due to issues
in the photoionization data used, which was later claimed to have no impact on the oxygen
abundance inference36. Recent helioseismic determinations of the solar heavy-element content
favour a lower value10;37;38. Buldgen et al. (2023)39 showed that the agreement found in Magg
et al. (2022)31 was a direct result of the standard model recipe and did not alleviate the need for
further revisions of fundamental ingredients. Overall, the debate has unveiled a more complex,
multi-faceted picture of the current problem with solar models that impacts multiple aspects
beyond abundance determinations and thus requires innovative approaches to tackle it and fully
exploit helioseismic data. The ﬁrst measurement of iron opacity in almost solar conditions at
Sandia national laboratories40 showed discrepancies between 30% and 400% with theoretical
results in the wavelength range between 7.0 and 12.7 Å. Further measurements were carried
out for nickel and chromium, showing also signiﬁcant, although more modest, discrepancies41
while more recent experiments for iron exclude the higher range of values from the Sandia
measurements42. Early inversions6 also hinted at possible opacity revisions in solar models
of the time and thus motivate our approach to determine the solar opacity directly from helio-
seismic data. The current state of affairs is somewhat reminiscent of the 1980s, when various
authors43;44 pleaded to improve theoretical opacity computations for Cepheids and in line with
