Brownian bridge above a curve

where we simply bounded the integrand by one on the second half of the integration interval. By
using the elementary inequality 1 −e−x < x valid for x ≥0, we have the following bound for the
first integral on the right-hand side of (A.6),

where here we used that u < b3/4 to bound u/b by 1/s1/4, and s > 1 to bound log(e + s) by 2s1/4.
Regarding the second integral on the right-hand side of (A.6), we note that it is equivalent to

Therefore, thanks to the fact that x ≥1, the claim follows by collecting the previous estimates.

Brownian bridge above a positive curve
Proposition A.4. For ι ∈(0, 1/8), let ζ : R+
0 →R+
0 be a continuous and non-decreasing function
such that ζ(0) > 1 and ζ(s) = o(sι) as s →∞, and let x > ζ(0). Then, for all b ≥1 and
u ∈[bι, b3/4], it holds that
Px,u,b(τζ > b) ≥(1 −δ)2xu

Proof. We start by noticing that, thanks to (A.2), it holds that

(A.8)
and so we can just focus on finding a suitable upper bound for the probability in (A.8). Using the
strong Markov property of the Brownian bridge at the stopping time τζ and again (A.2), we have that
Px,u,b(τζ ≤b < τ0) ≤
Z b/2

Px,u,b(τζ ∈ds)Pζ(s),u,b−s(τ0 > b −s) + Px,ζ(b),b/2(τ0 > b/2)

where to obtain the bound in the first line, we observed that the probability that the first time the
Brownian bridge from x to u in time b hits ζ is after time b/2 is bounded above by the probability that
the Brownian bridge from x to ζ(b) in time b/2 stays above 0. We now focus on the integral in the last
line of the above display. By integrating by parts, we note that
Z b/2
