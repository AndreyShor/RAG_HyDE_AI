Abstract
A low-grade tumor is a slow-growing tumor with a lower likelihood of spreading compared to
high-grade tumors. Mathematical modeling using partial differential equations (PDEs) plays a crucial
role in describing tumor behavior, growth and progression. This study employs the Burgess and
extended Fisher–Kolmogorov equations to model low-grade brain tumors. We utilize Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) based algorithm to develop an automated numerical solver for these models
and explore their application in solving forward and inverse problems in brain tumor modeling.
The study aims to demonstrate that the PINN based algorithms serve as advanced methodologies
for modeling brain tumor dynamics by integrating deep learning with physics-informed principles.
Additionally, we establish generalized error bounds in terms of training and quadrature errors. The
convergence and stability of the neural network are derived for both models. Numerical tests confirm
the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithms in both linear and nonlinear cases. Additionally, a
statistical analysis of the numerical results is presented.
Keywords: Brain tumor dynamics modeling, PINN, Forward Problems, Inverse Problems, Reaction-Diffusion

Introduction
A brain tumor represents an anomalous tissue mass resulting from unchecked cellular proliferation, serving no
useful purpose within the brain. These growths can emerge in various brain regions and exhibit diverse imaging
features. Brain tumors are commonly divided into two main types: primary and metastatic. Primary tumors
originate in the brain, affecting cells, glands, neurons, or the encompassing membranes. Metastatic, or secondary,
tumors occur when cancer cells from other body parts spread to the brain. Gliomas originate from glial cells and
represent the most prevalent form of primary brain tumors. The tumors are distinguished by their aggressive
growth and invasive behavior in humans. Glioma treatment typically includes chemotherapy, radiation, and
surgery. The model was designed to represent a recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma case undergoing chemotherapy.
It has since been adapted to estimate the effects of varying surgical resection levels and to account for differences
in tumor growth and diffusion, thereby capturing a wide range of glioma behaviors. Gliomas, although capable
of developing at any age, are predominantly found in adults aged over forty-five. These tumors usually form
in the brain’s hemispheres but can also emerge in the lower part of the brain. Burgess et al. [8] developed
mathematical framework for gliomas in 1997. A model incorporating fractional operators was later developed
by [20]. More recently, [38] conducted simulations of this model using Fibonacci and Haar wavelets. The EFK
equation was developed by augmenting the Fisher–Kolmogorov (FK) model with a fourth-order derivative term, as
presented in [10], [16], and [49]. The EFK equation is widely applied across various physics disciplines, including
fluid dynamics, plasma science, nuclear reactions, ecological modeling, and epidemic studies [2]. However, these
equations can exhibit very complex behavior, especially in reaction-diffusion systems, due to their nonlinear
nature and complex computational domains [2]. [7] provides a fundamental framework for describing low-grade
glioma growth and progression, effectively capturing tumor cells’ infiltration and proliferation characteristics.
