3.3. Dynamics on Unitary Manifolds and Varia-
tional Quantum Circuits
A powerful way to understand the training of
quantum models (such as variational quantum cir-
cuits) is through the lens of dynamics on unitary
manifolds. Any fixed-size quantum model (e.g. an
n-qubit quantum circuit) performs transformations
in a Hilbert space via unitary operators. The space
of all N × N unitary matrices (up to global phase)
forms a Lie group manifold U(N) (or SU(N) for de-
terminant 1), which for N = 2n has real dimension
N 2 −1 = 22n −1. Each parameterized quantum
circuit corresponds to a path within this manifold
of unitaries, which in turn induces a trajectory in
the space of quantum states when acting on a ref-
erence state. For example, consider a parametrized
unitary U(θ) = UL(θL) · · · U2(θ2)U1(θ1) composed
of L elementary gates. As we vary the parameter
vector θ = (θ1, . . . , θL), the unitary U(θ) traces
out a surface on the U(N) manifold. If each gate
Uk(θk) = e−iθkGk is the exponential of a Hermitian
generator Gk (e.g. a Pauli operator for qubit ro-
tations), then moving an infinitesimal amount dθk
corresponds to a tangent step −i dθk Gk U(θ) at the
current point on the unitary manifold. The collec-
tion of such generators {Gk} (and their commu-
tation relations) determines the local geometry of
reachable states: if the Gk do not all commute, the
path is nontrivial and can cover a much larger por-
tion of the manifold. In the special case that all
Gk mutually commute, U(θ) would simply equal
exp[−i(P
k θkGk)] and the trajectory would lie on
a torus (flat submanifold) within U(N). Generally,
however, layered circuits have non-commuting gen-
erators, and the resultant trajectory can be thought
of as a curved path that winds through U(N), ca-
pable of reaching any unitary (if the set of gener-
ators is universal for the Lie algebra u(N)). Thus,
a sufficiently expressive variational quantum circuit
can navigate the entire unitary manifold (at least
in principle), which is exponentially larger in di-
mension than any classical parameter space for n
bits.
Training such a circuit (via adjusting θ) is
essentially a process of finding an optimal path or
positioning on this high-dimensional curved mani-
fold to accomplish a learning task.
The geometric view of QML training enables us
to import tools like natural gradients and geodesic
updates from differential geometry.
In classical
deep learning, one often uses the Fisher informa-
tion matrix to compute a natural gradient update
that respects the geometry of the parameter space,
moving in a direction that causes a maximal re-
duction in loss per unit of “distance” in param-
eter space.
Analogously, in QML the quantum
natural gradient uses the quantum Fisher informa-
tion (Fubini–Study metric) as the underlying met-
ric for the parameters of a quantum circuit. Con-
cretely, if L(θ) is a loss function (e.g. an expec-
tation value to minimize), the steepest descent di-
rection in the curved quantum state space is given
by ∆θi ∝−P
j(J−1)ij ∂L
∂θj , where Jij is the QFI
(FS) metric tensor defined earlier. Following this
direction aligns the parameter update with the nat-
ural geometry of the state manifold, often leading
to faster convergence and better performance com-
pared to an unmetriced gradient descent. One can
interpret this update as moving along a geodesic on
the manifold of states or unitaries, ensuring that
the new state |ψ(θ + ∆θ)⟩is as close as possible
to the old state |ψ(θ)⟩in terms of quantum fidelity,
while still improving the loss. Such techniques have
already been applied in variational quantum eigen-
solvers and classifiers, highlighting how respecting
quantum geometry can mitigate issues like bar-
ren plateaus (regions of vanishing gradients) by ac-
counting for the true curvature of the landscape
rather than the raw parameter-space slope.
Consider a simple yet illustrative example: a sin-
gle qubit variational circuit with two parameters,
U(θ1, θ2) = e−iθ2Y e−iθ1X (a rotation about X fol-
lowed by a rotation about Y ). This can reach any
point on the Bloch sphere. The parameters θ1, θ2
form a coordinate chart on SU(2) ∼= S3 (which
double-covers the Bloch sphere S2).
The Fubini
-Study metric in these coordinates is nontrivial (be-
cause X and Y rotations do not commute), produc-
ing a curved metric g(θ1, θ2) rather than a flat iden-
tity matrix. If one naively did gradient descent on
θ1, θ2, the steps would not account for how a small
change in θ1 vs. θ2 affects the state differently de-
pending on the current θ values. By computing the
quantum natural gradient, one effectively precondi-
tions these updates with g−1, ensuring movement
along the Bloch sphere is appropriately calibrated.
This is akin to following great-circle distances on
the sphere rather than treating θ1, θ2 as Cartesian
axes.
In multi-qubit circuits, the same principle
holds but with a much higher-dimensional Jij; the
method directs the parameter updates along the
geodesics of the complex projective manifold of the
n-qubit state.
Finally, it is worth noting that viewing QML
