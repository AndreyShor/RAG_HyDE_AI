Supplementary Figure 5. 
Fig. S9. Full dataset for the first cycle SNOM scan of device 1. a, Topography of 
device 1. b-s, SNOM images at different Vg following the sequence of applied Vg in our 
experiment. The range of the applied Vg is between -45 V and 60 V. All the presented 
figures share the same color bar (0.6 V-1.6 V). b, d, f, h, k, m, o, and p are presented in 
Figs. 2a-2h of the main text. n, o, and s are presented in Figs. 3a-3c of the main text. 
Weak fringe features in the vertical direction of SNOM images are presumably caused 
by the interference effect arising from scattered light from nearby silver paste used to 
make sample contact. Figs. 3a-3c of the main text are from this first cycle measurement
