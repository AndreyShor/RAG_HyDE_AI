These properties are consistent with the distributive law of the classical Nambu
bracket.
Additionally, the deformation should preserve the properties of the classical
Nambu bracket that arise from its complete antisymmetry, including:
• Charge preservation:
δR(Q1,Q2)Q1,2 = 0
(3.3)
• Charge exchange symmetry:
δR(Q1,Q2)XI = −δR(Q2,Q1)XI
(3.4)
Finally, the most important property is the composition rule of transforma-
tions, which ensures that the Fundamental Identity (F.I.) of the classical Nambu
bracket is maintained even after repeated deformations. This rule plays a role
analogous to the Jacobi identity in matrix algebras:
{Q, {H, X}} = {{Q, H}, X} + {H, {Q, X}}.
(3.5)
The composition rule for the RVPD is expressed as:
δR(Q1,Q2)δR(H1,H2)XI =
δR(δR(Q1,Q2)H1,H2)XI + δR(H1,δR(Q1,Q2)H2)XI + δR(H1,H2)δR(Q1,Q2)XI.
(3.6)
This property ensures that the composition of transformations under the
RVPD remains consistent and maintains the algebraic structure of the theory.
When the volume-preserving deformation (VPD) is straightforwardly ap-
plied through matrix regularization, it takes the form:
δVPDXI = [τ(Q1, Q2), XI] + ∂XI
∂σ3 [Q1, Q2] + Σ(Q1, Q2; XI).
(3.7)
It is evident that this formulation violates all of the desired properties except
for charge exchange symmetry.
Among the terms, the component that best preserves the distributive prop-
erty of the deformation is:
[τ(Q1, Q2), XI].
(3.8)
Therefore, we aim to perform gauge ﬁxing in such a way that this term is
retained while the problematic terms are eliminated.
However, the term introduces an incomplete Leibniz rule between the τ
bracket and the commutator [, ], as shown below:
[τ(A, B), C] = τ([A, C], B) + τ(A, [B, C]) + ∆(A, B; C).
