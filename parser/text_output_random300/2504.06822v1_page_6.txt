The last auxiliary parameter that needs to be determined is the continuum threshold, s0. Its value is limited by the energy
of the next excited state and is state-dependent, meaning it is different for the ground state, the ﬁrst orbital and the ﬁrst radial
excitation. To limit the contribution of higher excited states in the calculations, s0 is chosen based on the speciﬁc state under
consideration. Table III lists the valid ranges for the M 2 and the s0 across all channels and in both schemes.
The examination of the ﬁrst three resonances’ contribution (FTRC) convergenceprovides valuable insights. Hence, we analyze
the behavior of the FTRC within speciﬁed working intervals of auxiliary parameters. Fig. 1 illustrates the dependence of the
FTRC on M 2 for three ﬁxed values of s0 for the particle Ω
∗
ccb as an example. The results conﬁrm that within the valid renges
of auxiliary parameters, the dominance of the pole contribution for the considered resonances is well maintained. In these
calculations, the contribution of six-dimensional operators does not exceed 5% in average values of the auxiliary parameters,
and the contributions of higher-dimensional operators (eight) remain below 1%. As a result, the requirements of the method are
fully satisﬁed.

Based on the analyses conducted, we noticed that the physical quantities exhibit a weak dependence to the auxiliary parameters
within the deﬁned range of M 2 and s0. To demonstrate the stability and impact of auxiliary parameters on the predicted masses,
we have plotted Figs. 2 and 3. The results indicate remarkable stability of the masses concerning the M 2 and s0 within the
relevant working ranges. It is noteworthy that our ﬁndings indicate minimal sensitivity to auxiliary parameters for all triply
heavy baryons with spin-3/2. For this reason, we have included only the plots corresponding to the Ω

ccb states as
examples.
After determining the relevant ranges for the auxiliary parameters, we have presented the computed values of the masses and
residues in the two pole and MS schemes for the studied states in Table III. As previously mentioned, our method involves a
step-by-step advancement in Eq. (15), which leads to the calculation of the ground , the ﬁrst orbital excitation and the ﬁrst radial
excitation states. As discussed earlier, initially, by selecting an appropriate range for the threshold parameter, as also indicated in
Table III, we compute the mass and residue of the triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2 in the 1S state within the framework of the
1S state + continuum scheme. In the second step, by increasing the threshold parameter to deﬁne an appropriate range and using
the computed values for the 1S state as input, we calculate the mass and residue of the second resonance (1P) state through the 1S
state + 1P state + continuum scheme. The results of the 1P state are also presented in Table III. Finally, by adjusting the range
