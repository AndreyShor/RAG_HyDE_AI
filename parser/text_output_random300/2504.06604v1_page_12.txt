The computed bulk and shear moduli for each 2D image are listed in Table 2. The results indicate that the TS-based
images yield 25 % lower bulk moduli and 30 % lower shear moduli than the CT plane. Although this analysis is limited
to 2D comparisons, it highlights the variations in elastic moduli between paired but modality-different digitized images.
These findings suggest the potential for correcting 3D image-based effective moduli using numerical simulations, as
CT-derived moduli are consistently stiffer than those measured in laboratory experiments [Saxena et al., 2017b, 2019b].

Geological features
Lastly, we examine additional geological insights by directly comparing grayscale CT images with their paired TS
images. Figure 11 shows the registered grayscale CT image alongside its corresponding TS image for one-to-one
comparison. The TS image enhances the visibility of individual grains, which are less distinct in the CT plane, and
provides information on calcite cementation. Although Fe-bearing minerals (white) are distinguishable from quartz
(dark gray) in our dataset’s grayscale CT plane (Figure 11), identifying specific mineralogical information becomes
challenging when the 3D digital rock consists of minerals with similar densities (e.g., quartz and orthoclase, which
have less than a 3 % density difference; [Goldfarb et al., 2022]). Additionally, the TS image reveals weathering effects,
distinguishing intact and clean quartz from areas affected by cementation or weathering processes.
By integrating these paired images, we can correlate geological features such as cementation, mineralogy, and
weathering conditions. This correlation enables a more accurate assignment of material properties based on real
geological characteristics rather than relying solely on intact mineral component properties, thereby improving the
accuracy of computed effective properties.

Conclusion
We develop a systematic image registration approach to align 2D thin-section images within a 3D CT volume using
differential evolution (DE) optimization. The method is first validated on a synthetic porous medium with a known 2D
plane location, achieving near-perfect alignment with rotation angle errors below 0.001 degrees. Applying the approach
to Berea sandstone, we successfully register the thin-section image within the CT volume, achieving a structural
similarity index of 0.990.
With this valid registration, we explore the advantages of paired 2D multimodal images for improving 3D digital
rock-based computed effective properties. The thin-section image reveals approximately 50 % more porosity than the
CT plane and shows a consistent reduction in pore sizes, both of which may help correct porosity underestimation and
permeability overestimation in 3D CT-based computations. Additionally, bulk and shear moduli computed from thin
sections are 25 % and 30% lower, respectively, than those derived from CT images, suggesting potential corrections
for CT-derived moduli, which tend to be stiffer than laboratory measurements. Beyond these quantitative differences,
the thin-section image provides additional geological insights, revealing cementation patterns, mineral phases, and
