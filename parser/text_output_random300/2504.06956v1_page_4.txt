Remark 1.4. There is also an equivalent deterministic normalisation, called “Seneta–Heyde normali-
sation”, which produces the same limiting measure µγc up to a deterministic multiplicative constant,
namely
µSH
γc,t(dx) =
√
teγc Xt(x)−γc2

(1.8)
converges weakly in probability to
√
2/π µγc as t →∞[JSW19, Pow21]. In the present article,
unless otherwise stated, we always refer to the critical GMC as the one obtained using the derivative
normalisation (1.7).
In the low temperature or supercritical regime, i.e. γ > γc, the GMC exhibits atomic behaviour under
suitable renormalisation, with the locations and masses of the atoms dictated by the extremal statistics
or near maximum values of the fields Xt. In the continuum, the only available mathematical result we
are aware of is [MRV16], where Madaule, Rhodes, and Vargas show that for γ > γc, the sequence of
random measures

converges weakly in law as t →∞to a nontrivial purely atomic limiting measure µγ whose law
was previously conjectured in [DRSV14a] and can be characterised explicitly in terms of the law of
the critical GMC µγc. In order to describe this limiting measure, it is convenient to introduce the
following notation which will be used throughout the paper.
Definition 1.5. For γ > γc and a non-negative, locally finite Borel measure ν on Rd, we let ηγ[ν] be
the Poisson point measure on Rd × R+
0 with intensity measure given by ν(dx) ⊗z−(1+γc /γ)dz. We
also define the integrated atomic random measure with parameter γ and spatial intensity ν as the
random purely atomic measure Pγ[ν] on Rd given by
Pγ[ν](dx)
def=
Z ∞
0
z ηγ[ν](dx, dz) .
With this notation in place, we can state the main result of [MRV16] more precisely.
Theorem 1.6 ([MRV16, Theorem 2.2]). For any γ > γc, there exists a constant cγ > 0 such that the
sequence of random measures (µγ,t)t>0 defined in (1.9) converges weakly in the topology of vague
convergence to cγPγ[µγc] as t →∞, where µγc is the critical GMC.
1.1
Overview of the main results
Building on Theorem 1.6, the main goal of the present article is to gain a deeper understanding of the
convergence behaviour of supercritical GMC measures as t →∞. A natural approach is as follows:
instead of simply taking the limit as t →∞of µγ,t defined in (1.9), we consider the measure-valued
stochastic processes (µγ,t+s)s≥0 as t →∞. As we will see below, this procedure yields a limiting
stochastic process (νγ,s)s≥0, and our goal is to investigate its nature1.
Remark 1.7. A helpful way to interpret the role of the process (νγ,s)s≥0 is through an analogy with
the CLT. Consider a collection (Xn)n∈N of i.i.d. centred random variables with unit variance, and
let Sn
def= Pn
k=1 Xk. The CLT tells us that n−1/2Sn converges in law to a standard normal random
variable as n →∞. On the linear time scale, the normalised sums quickly settle into a “stable”
distribution. However, if we switch to a logarithmic time scale, we can capture how the marginals at
different times evolve together. More precisely, for every t ≥0, define Yt
def= ⌊et⌋−1/2S⌊et⌋. Then,
the process (Yt+s)s≥0 converges in the finite-dimensional sense to a stationary Ornstein–Uhlenbeck
process (Us)s≥0 as t →∞. Intuitively, this follows since, for fixed s ≥0, it holds that
Yt+s =
S⌊et⌋
p
⌊et+s⌋
+ S⌊et+s⌋−S⌊et⌋
p
⌊et+s⌋
≈e−s/2Yt + (1 −e−s)1/2Y′
t ,
1If the convergence in Theorem 1.6 was in probability, then the process νγ,s would necessarily be constant in s.
