Our underlying dynamical system,
dXt
dt = ∇(R + S)(Xt),
reduces to
˙ξ =
v0 + ϵ2v1
c(cosh2ξ −cos2 η),
˙η =
u0 + ϵ2u1
c(cosh2ξ −cos2 η),
where v0, v1, u0 and u1 are given above.
It only remains to find v0 = v0(ξ) and u0 = u0(η), which is easy because miraculously
in the Euler two-centre problem for our coordinates, z = f(w), X + iY = f(ξ + iη), we
obtain the separation of variables, R = R(ξ), S = S(η), and more importantly, we have
a quantum Liouville property,
