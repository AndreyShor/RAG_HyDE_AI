X7 + iY7, there is always a solution with S1 = X1 + iY1 = 0 and one with S1 ̸= 0. These
pairs are A±|Y1=0 and A±|Y1̸=0, B+ and C, as well as B−and D. The physical meaning of
this result is understood once we recall that S0 and S7 characterize the magnetic sector4,
namely the amplitudes which are well deﬁned already for N = 1 and describe the interaction
within a single copy. On the other hand, S1 characterizes the overlap sector5 containing the
amplitudes which involve diﬀerent copies. Hence, the solutions with S1 = 0 (no overlap)
correspond to the fact that the magnetic ﬁxed points can be studied with no reference to
overlaps (N = 1). On the other hand, the partner solutions with S0 and S7 unchanged and
S1 ̸= 0 reﬂect the fact that the overlap properties do not aﬀect the magnetic ones.
With this understanding, we begin with the identiﬁcation of the solutions corresponding
to the magnetic ﬁxed points P, N and Z of Figure 1. The fact that the two-dimensional Ising
ferromagnet without disorder is a theory of free fermions [7, 38] implies that P corresponds
to6 A−|Y1=0. In absence of disorder [⟨qa,b(x)qa,b(y)⟩] = ⟨σ(x)σ(y)⟩2, so that at P there is also
trivial overlap criticality (uncorrelated copies) with Xq = 2Xσ.
Turning to the ﬁxed points N and Z, we can exploit the fact that the scattering theory
was used to study the magnetic sector of the random bond q-state Potts model [6, 14], which
yields the Ising model for q = 2.
The q-dependence of the diﬀerent solutions allowed to
identify the magnetic sector of the Ising ﬁxed points N and Z with our present solution
B−, the two points being distinguished by the sign of Y7. On the other hand, the identity
[⟨qa,b(x)qa,b(y)⟩] = [⟨σ(x)σ(y)⟩], which is known [23, 24] to hold at the Nishimori point N,
implies that at this point there is also overlap criticality with Xq = Xσ. This simultaneous
magnetic and overlap criticality corresponds to the partner solution of B−with S1 ̸= 0,
namely to solution D. The coincidence at point N of the spin and overlap correlation functions
indicates that the critical behaviors in the two sectors coincide at this point, namely that
S1 = S7. It is then no accident that solution D indeed allows for this identity. Overlap
criticality is expected in the whole region from Z to G. Hence, simultaneous magnetic and
overlap criticality at the ﬁxed point Z corresponds again to solution D, the diﬀerence with N
being made by sign choices.
Finally, we should identify the solution corresponding to the spin glass ﬁxed point G. The
absence of magnetic criticality at G excludes the solutions A−, B−and D which, as we saw,
account for the ﬁxed points P, N and Z. In addition, solution B+ corresponds to uncorrelated
copies (S1 = 0). We are then left with the solutions A+ and C. They correspond to diﬀerent
