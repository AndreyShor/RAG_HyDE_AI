The ATLAS Higgs to diphoton channel has allowed for measurements of the Higgs boson
cross section of 38±19 fb from 450-650 GeV and 5.4±7.6 fb for 650-1300 GeV, both in agreement
with the SM prediction [532]. The result is dominated by statistical errors for both bins. The
95% CL upper limits on the ratio of the observed cross section to standard model prediction are
3.1 and 5.8 for the 450-650 GeV and 650-1300 GeV bins respectively, a substantial improvement
on the limits provided by the b¯b channel.
The cross section times branching ratio is more
limited than for b¯b decays, but the channel benefits from the rising signal-to-background ratio
(due primarily to the 2 →3 nature of the diphoton background process compared to 2 →2 for
Higgs boson production) for high Higgs boson transverse momenta. As with Sherlock Holmes’
dog that didn’t bark (The Memoirs of Sherlock Holes, Arthur Conan Doyle, 1892), the presence
of no Higgs diphoton events at very high pT can serve as a useful limit on the possible Higgs
boson cross section in that kinematic region.

H+ ≥2j
LH21 status: VBF production known at N3LOQCD accuracy for the total cross section [553]
and at NNLOQCD accuracy differentially [147,304] in the “DIS” approximation [554]. LO Higgs
decays H →WW ∗and H →b¯b were included to the NNLOQCD description of the VBF
production process in Ref. [293]. The double-virtual contributions to non-factorizable corrections
are known in the eikonal approximation [555,556]. Full NLOQCD corrections for H + 3j in the
VBF channel available [557,558]. H+ ≤3j in the gluon fusion channel was studied in Ref. [559]
and an assessment of the mass dependence of the various jet multiplicities was made in Ref. [560];
the impact of the top-quark mass in H + 1, 2 jets was studied in Ref. [561]; NLOEW corrections
to stable Higgs boson production in VBF calculated [562] and available in Hawk [563]. Mass
effects in H +2j at large energy are known within the “High Energy Jets” framework [521–526].
Parton shower and matching uncertainties for VBF Higgs productions have been studied in detail
using PYTHIA and HERWIG matched to Madgraph5_aMC@NLO and POWHEG in Ref. [564];
the PYTHIA and VINCIA parton showers were compared in Ref. [565]. A comparative study of
VBF Higgs production at fixed order and with parton shower Monte Carlos has been carried
out in Ref. [342], as an outgrowth of Les Houches 2019.
VBF production at NNLOQCD with the inclusion of both the NLOQCD and the NNLOQCD
corrections to the Higgs decay H →b¯b was presented in Ref. [566]. These effects are substantial,
amounting to a decrease of 7% at both NLOQCD and NNLOQCD, largely due to the interplay
between the radiation off the b-quarks and the kinematic cut placed on the b-tagged jets.
It is known [555, 556] that double-virtual contributions to non-factorizable QCD correc-
tions beyond the DIS approximation are an order of magnitude smaller than the NNLOQCD
corrections in the factorized approximation, although with a large scale uncertainty of around
20% −30% (due to the fact that they appear at NNLOQCD for this first time). In Ref. [567],
the double-virtual corrections were combined with real-real and real-virtual corrections for the
non-factorizable contributions, and it was observed that the double-virtual contributions are
completely dominant. In Ref. [568], the next-to-leading eikonal contributions were shown to
modify the non-factorizable corrections by approximately 30%. In Ref. [569] the O(β0α3
s) cor-
rections were computed, and were shown to reduce the scale uncertainty associated with the
non-factorizable corrections to around 5%. Fully analytic expressions for the two-loop ampli-
tude in the eikonal approximation were presented in Ref. [570].
Recently, NLL accurate parton showers for VBF production have become available with
the PanScales method, and these were matched to LO calculations in Ref. [571]. For exclusive
observables, such as those related to the third jet, the impact of the NLL corrections can be as
large as 15%, and generally results in a softer spectrum of the third jet. NLOQCD and NLOEW
