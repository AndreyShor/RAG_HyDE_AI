FIG. 3. Quantum-stabilized modulated ground states. (a) Examples of measured density distributions of quantum-
stabilized states of 164Dy in different trap geometries: (a1) cigar-shaped trap, (a2) surfboard trap, (a3) circular pancake trap,
taken from [88, 89]. (b, c) Theoretical phase diagrams of 164Dy gases with transverse dipole orientation in infinite cigar and
pancake traps, adapted from [83] and [86] respectively. The color map shows the modulation contrast C . The region with
C = 0 is the uniform state. The roton excitation of this state fully softens at a∗
rot (red line). The transition to the modulated
states occurs at ac (white and black lines, respectively). The modulated states are illustrated via density isosurfaces and the
transitions between different crystal structures identified (white lines). (d) Same as (c), but with dipoles tilted by α = 30o
compared to the pancake confinement axis, taken from [90]. Continuous (resp. discontinuous) transitions are indicated by
dotted (resp. solid) lines with end points identified by C.P. or T.P. (e) Phase diagram of 164Dy gases in a pancake trap with
radial and axial frequencies ω∥,⊥= 2π × (125, 250) Hz, taken from [91]. Transitions are marked by black lines. Different crystal
structures are identified, and their density profiles (markers) illustrated in subpanels.
ping potential but smaller and slower interaction ramps,
three groups observed the formation of metastable states
with supersolid properties using either 166Er, 164Dy, or
162Dy [15–17].
For 164Dy, supersolid states were also
formed via direct evaporative cooling from a thermal
state at the final interaction settings [16, 92]. These ex-
periments used relatively shallow cigar traps with axial
frequencies between 16 and 32 Hz and averaged radial
frequencies between 65 and 260 Hz.
The dipoles were
aligned along one radial direction, and between 40 000
and 80 000 atoms were trapped. The supersolids showed
linear crystal structures with a few crystal sites, each
populated by several thousand atoms, and thereby called
droplets, see Fig. 3(a). These states were observed to live
from a few tens of ms for 162Dy and 166Er to a few hun-
dreds of ms for 164Dy after interaction ramps. Longer
lifetimes, on the order of seconds, were achieved using
temperature ramps [92].
Following these initial observations, the search for
more complex crystal structures drove particular in-
terest.
Supersolids with nonlinear crystal structures
were successfully realized, with first zigzag supersolids
in surfboard-shaped traps [88], see Fig. 3(a2), and then
circularly symmetric triangular supersolids (hexagon su-
persolids) in a round pancake trap [89], see Fig. 3(a3).
These supersolids were produced via temperature ramps,
and exhibit second-long lifetimes. Compared to the ear-
lier experiments of Refs. [11, 14], significantly larger atom
numbers were used with N=65 000 and 44 000, while
the traps remained relatively shallow with frequencies
(33,75,167) Hz and (47,44,133) Hz in the three spatial di-
rections, for Ref. [88] and [89] respectively. In both cases,
the dipoles were aligned along the tightest trap direction.
