that is found at distances larger than the cage radius. For both the ground and
excited states, the 4s orbital extends significantly beyond the confines of the fullerene
cage, with more than 80% of the density lying beyond the Ar@C60 radius of 3.54 ˚A.
However, while the ground state unoccupied 4s orbital is of almost exclusively argon
character (92% contribution), the excited state instead has only a 13% Ar contribu-
tion. In other words, the highly delocalised excited state is of majority carbon, i.e.
fullerene cage, character. (We use the C-squared population analysis method of Ros
and Schuit[39] to determine the contributions. See S.I. for a detailed discussion.)
The combination of the dominant fullerene character and the highly diffuse nature of
the excited state is characteristic of superatomic molecular orbitals[23–25]. With this
in mind, we have used the QSYM2[40] framework to examine the symmetry of the
excited-state orbital. Applying the relevant QSYM2 projection operators (see SI for
details), we find that the excited-state orbital shown in Fig. 3(b) comprises approxi-
mately 76% S-symmetry component, 23% D-symmetry component, and a very small
contribution (less than 1%) from G-symmetry. This is to be contrasted with the
ground state 4s orbital, which has essentially pure (i.e. almost 100%) S-symmetry.
The significant incorporation of the D-symmetry component in the excited 4s orbital
is attributed to the interaction with the carbon cage (as expected from the popula-
tion analysis discussed above), providing a mechanism for mixing of the argon and
fullerene density in a highly delocalised orbital.

Fig. 3 Ground vs core-excited 4s state. Isosurfaces and radial distribution functions for the
ground-state and excited-state 4s molecular orbitals. The isosurfaces are plotted at isovalues of ± 0.04
˚A−3. The shaded area of each radial distribution function highlights the density that exists beyond
the radius of the cage, rAr@C60.
