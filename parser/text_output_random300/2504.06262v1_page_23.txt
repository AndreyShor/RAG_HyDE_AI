as live imaging of the full field and its derived quantities.
D. Velocity decomposition and kinetic energy spectrum
Figure 12 Velocity decomposition for two vortices of same
sign. The phase map is used to compute the total velocity vtot
in order to achieve the Helmholtz decomposition. Each com-
ponent gives the velocity contribution of the acoustic waves
(compressible) and vortices (incompressible).
As explained in Section II.D, the velocity field of the
paraxial fluid of light is defined as the phase gradient in
the transverse plane v = c
k0
∇⊥ϕ. As we have shown in
the previous section, the spatially resolved phase can be
obtained using interferometric techniques.
To analyze these velocity fields, we need to recon-
struct the total velocity from the experimentally mea-
sured phase map. The total velocity field vtot(r) is de-
rived from the spatial gradients of the phase after careful
unwrapping along both spatial axes to avoid phase dis-
continuities to appear. The unwrapped phases along the
x and y directions are noted ϕ′
x and ϕ′
y, respectively. The
total velocity field is then expressed as the combination
of the gradient components along each spatial axis:
vtot(r⊥) = c

In the absence of phase singularities, this effectively
gives a zero curl: ∇× v = 0.
However this property
does not hold in the case of the density-weighted velocity
utot(r⊥) =
p
ρ(r⊥)vtot(r⊥). By introducing this quan-
tity, it becomes possible to distinguishing between the
compressible (irrotational) and the incompressible (rota-
tional) components of the velocity field. These compo-
nents are defined by the Helmholtz decomposition:
utot(r⊥) = ∇θ(r⊥)
| {z }
compressible
+ ∇× A(r⊥)
|
{z
}
incompressible
,
(100)
where θ(r⊥) is a scalar potential and A(r⊥) a vector
potential. In momentum space, the Helmholtz decompo-
sition of the velocity field is given by:
˜utot(k⊥) = ik⊥˜uθ(k⊥) + ik⊥× ˜uA(k⊥),
(101)
with
˜uθ(k⊥) = k⊥· ˜utot(k⊥)
i|k⊥|2
,
˜uA(k⊥) = ik⊥× ˜utot(k⊥)
|k⊥|2
.
(102)
By performing inverse Fourier transforms, these compo-
nents are retrieved in real space:
∇θ(r⊥) = F−1 [ik⊥˜uθ(k⊥)] ,
∇× A(r⊥) = F−1 [ik⊥× ˜uA(k⊥)] .
(103)
To simplify the computation, the incompressible velocity
component is often obtained by directly subtracting the
compressible part from the total velocity (Panico et al.,
2023).
This approach allows for a clear separation of
the compressible and incompressible contributions to the
fluid’s kinetic energy (Baker-Rasooli et al., 2023).
An
example of this velocity decomposition is shown in Fig.12
for a vortex pair of same sign.

Having a direct access to the phase in fluids of light
allows for unambiguous identification of topological ob-
jects. Vortices are defined by a variation ∆ϕ of the phase
of the wavefunction (or the phase of the electric field
envelope) by a multiple of 2π due to the uniqueness of
the condensate wavefunction (or electric field envelope)
(Pethick and Smith, 2008):
