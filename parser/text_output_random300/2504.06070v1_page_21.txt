The results in Tables S4 and S5 highlight the superiority of our approach in predicting the latent
physical quantities. Moreover, even with a constant factor difference, a high correlation (≥0.9)
is sufficient to demonstrate the consistency between our predictions and the true data in terms of
distribution, regardless of scaling. This can serve as supplementary information for concentration
prediction and provide interpretable evidence for the future evolution of fluid dynamics.

ABLATION STUDY
In this section, we conduct ablation studies to assess the contributions of different components of
our method, including constraint ablation, model ablation, and prediction operator ablation.
E.1
CONSTRAINTS
The constraint ablation experiment consists of two parts: removing the physical constraints and
removing the temporal constraints:
Physical Constraints. We removed the physical constraints while retaining the temporal constraints
and retrained the model. The results show a decline in prediction accuracy due to the absence of
physical constraints (Table S6), and the inferred latent physical quantities exhibit issues, lacking real
physical significance (Figure S6).
Velocity-Pressure Constraint. To validate whether the inclusion of pressure p is beneficial for
prediction, we also designed an experiment: no Velocity-Pressure Constraint, which removes e1 in
Eq. 12. Results in Figure 9 (a) and Table 3 show that the inclusion of constraints and p is beneficial
for prediction. In Figure S6, we present this result, where it can be seen that the predicted velocity
field is not correct.
Temporal Constraints. We removed the temporal constraints while retaining the physical con-
straints and retrained the model. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy also declined
due to the lack of temporal constraints (Table S6), and the inference of latent physical quantities,
especially the pressure field, was problematic (Figure S6).
E.2
MODELS
In this section, we perform ablation experiments on our model structure by removing the correction
network to verify its necessity.
Correction Network.
As shown in Table S7, after removing the correction network, prediction
accuracy significantly decreased. Figure S7 illustrates an example where ”stripes” appeared in the
output after the correction network was removed. These artifacts are caused by errors in the gradient
operator. By using the correction network, this issue can be effectively mitigated.
