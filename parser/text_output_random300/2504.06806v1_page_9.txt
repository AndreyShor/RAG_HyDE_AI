Fig.4 Comparison with methods that directly include a mass-balance correction (MBC Aware) with 
those that compute only a difference between the folding states (Non MBC Aware). The plot reports 
the  distribution of the difference between the Pearsonâ€™s correlation after and before the mass-
balance term is added. The data are from Reeves and Kalyaanamoorthy30 
 
Conclusions 
The mass-balance correction (MBC), whether data-driven or based on an 
experimentally derived scale, demonstrates broad applicability, enhancing the 
performance of various potential-like methods developed through different 
approaches. These include knowledge-based potentials, sequence- and structure-
based protein language models (PLMs), and a self-supervised deep graph-neural 
network. Notably, MBC achieves these improvements without requiring any re-
parameterization of the base methods and with negligible additional computational 
cost. 
In several cases, the enhancement of the performance due to MBC is substantial. 
Specifically, in the case of Pythia, the results are particularly notable, bringing 
Pythia-MBC close to state-of-the-art performance while also addressing the method's
