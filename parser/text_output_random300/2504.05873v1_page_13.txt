function of t in the integral (3.1), we define the integrated energy distribution

The integrated distributions for first and second-generation electrons/positrons in E137
are shown in figure 3. In addition, we indicate the distribution of first-generation electrons
obtained when using the approximation E0 −E ≪E0. The approximate expression dif-
fers substantially from the exact first-generation distribution. However, it coincidentally
matches the more complete result, which includes second-generation effects, quite well.
The absorption of ALPs by electrons in the target is described by lλ, which leads to
exponential attenuation. This is relevant for thick targets but can be neglected here [70].
The ALP decay length la depends on the couplings as well as the energy and mass of the
ALP. It can be written as

The first exponential function in eq. (3.1) can be understood as the probability that the
ALP only decays after leaving the beam dump, such that the decay products do not get
absorbed. Conversely, the last term describes the probability that the ALP does not decay
behind the detector, i.e. that it decays inside the decay volume and can be detected.
With the simplifications discussed above, the general formula we use for the expected
number of detected ALPs is

The only missing ingredient is the differential cross section dσ/dx for the production of
ALPs, which will be discussed next.
