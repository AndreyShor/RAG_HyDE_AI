Hamiltonians of these two materials would aid in the
classification of universal QSL behaviors.
Our results
show that Zn-barlowite and herbertsmithite have robust
and consistent QSL physics, and they represent a most
promising class of kagome QSL materials.

AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS
ATB, JW, RWS, and YSL conceived the project. ATB,
ACC, JW, and YSL coordinated the project. ATB and
RWS synthesized and characterized the Zn-barlowite sin-
gle crystals. ATB performed the sample assembly with
significant help from ACC and JW. ATB, JW, and DMP
performed the neutron measurements with help from
ACC and YSL. ATB and ACC performed the background
subtractions and processing.
ACC and JW performed
the herbertsmithite quantitative analysis.
ATB, ACC,
and JW performed the analysis of temperature depen-
dence. ACC and ATB conceptualized and implemented
spin correlation models to interpret the data. ACC im-
plemented the linear regression model used to extract
the spin correlations. HCJ performed the DMRG calcu-
lations. ACC performed the kagome spin gap analysis.
ACC led visualization efforts and made final versions of
the figures. ACC, ATB, JW, HCJ, and YSL wrote the
paper with input from all co-authors.
