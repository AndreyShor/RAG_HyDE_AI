NQG III - Two-Centre Problems, Whirlpool Galaxy and Toy Neutron Stars

We hope that this paper leads to greater cooperation and collaboration with astronomers
not least in explaining some of the most striking photographs taken by Hubble. Firstly,
we see this and related works as a tribute to the founders of Natural Philosophy but
especially to Newton nearly 300 years after his death in 1727.
2. On the Semi-Classical Mechanics of Euler’s Two-Centre Problem and a
Quantum Elliptical Spiral Connecting Two Focal Centres
2.1. Semi-Classical Analysis of Two Centres
We use elliptical coordinates (ξ, η), where for our unit mass particle P, with
−→
OP = (X, Y ),
X + iY = c cosh(ξ + iη),
(X, Y ) being cartesian coordinates with origin O at the mid-point of the two centres (at
A12, (±c, 0)). Our putative elliptical spiral will converge to an ellipse E2c, centred at O
with A the semi-major axis, Ae = c, e the eccentricity, as we shall see.
From the above, z
c = ew + e−w

so the r.h.s. has a square root branch point requiring a cut z plane, with cut going from
(−c + 0i) to (+c + 0i). On this cut,

|X| < c,
so ξ = 0 on the cut and η = arctan

Our square root can now be defined by analytic continuation in the z plane. There
are no other singularities, because z
