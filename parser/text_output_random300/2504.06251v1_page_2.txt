The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) is a fascinating emergent quan-
tum state characterized by fractionally charged excitations in the absence of magnetic field,
which could arise from the intricate interplay between electron correlation, nontrivial topol-
ogy and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, FQAHE has been realized
in aligned rhombohedral pentalayer graphene on BN superlattice (aligned R5G/BN)1, where
the topological flat band is modulated by the moir´e potential. However, intriguingly, the
FQAHE is observed only when electrons are pushed away from the moir´e interface1–3. The
apparently opposite implications from these experimental observations, along with different
theoretical models4–17, have sparked intense debates regarding the role of the moir´e potential.
Unambiguous experimental observation of the topological flat band as well as moir´e bands
with energy and momentum resolved information is therefore critical to elucidate the under-
lying mechanism. Here by performing nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(NanoARPES) measurements, we directly reveal the topological flat band electronic struc-
tures of R5G, from which key hopping parameters essential for determining the fundamen-
tal electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene are extracted. Moreover, a comparison
