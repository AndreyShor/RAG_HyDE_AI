scaling of the ground state thermodynamic potential Ω= −PV :

see, e.g. [31, 37], whence one can recover (20). It is instructive however to make an inde-
pendent check of (20)
The behavior of specific heat, i.e., the derivative of the entropy near the thermal phase
transition has its counterpart for the quantum transition at T = 0, and it is related to the
entanglement. For reviews on entanglement and various measures to quantify it, see, e.g.,
[38–40]. We find it most convenient to use the global entanglement [41, 42]. It measures
proximity of the given quantum state to a probe factorized (disentangled or “classical”)
state. Taking the global entanglement S as a counterpart of the thermodynamic entropy,
we introduce the entanglement capacity
C ≡µ∂S
∂µ ,
(22)
which then should have the critical properties of the specific heat. For the XX chain in
transverse field which belongs to the same universality class as our model (2), the global
entanglement was calculated analytically in [41, 42], leading to
C ∝

in agreement with (20). The exact formula for the von Neumann entropy for a block of L
sites in the XX chain with transverse field [43]

(24)
valid for L < 1 (L < ξI), can be also tried to calculate the entanglement capacity (22) with
µ ↔h, µc ↔hc = 1. The result for C at h →1−(kF →0) and fixed L agrees with the
critical scaling (23) up to a logarithmic factor.3
An additional comment is in order. As an extra consistency check of the above scaling
analysis of the entanglement, let us recall some key results for the solvable deformation of
the transverse-field XX chain with modulations, when the spin anisotropy is added, i.e.,
XX ↣XY. This model’s deformation breaks U(1) symmetry, resulting in appearance of
anomalous terms ∝
cc + h.c. in its fermionic representation, i.e., number of particles is
not conserved anymore. As a consequence the IC gapless (metallic) phase vanishes and the
plateaux get smeared. From the results for the order parameters in different phases of the
XY chain (parity string order parameter, magnetization), gaps, and correlation lengthes,
the 2D Ising universality class of the transitions is established [44]. In particular, α = 0, the
specific heat of the Ising model diverges logarithmically. For the ladder this implies
C(ϵ) ∝−ln |ϵ|, |ϵ| ≪1 ,
(25)
where ϵ stands for the parametric distance to the quantum critical point. This again agrees
with the results of the direct calculations of S for the transverse XY chain [41, 42].
3 This is the limit L ≪ξI when the finite ξI is the largest scale. The same limit yields the critical index
η′, cf. (B34). Note that the correlation length ξ is infinite throughout the gapless phase.
