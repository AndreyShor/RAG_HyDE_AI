B.1. Scalar field theory in the vacuum
Let us start with a scalar quantum field theory in four spacetime dimensions with a quartic
interaction, (2.1). At tree level, λ(µ) = λ0, where λ0 ≡λ(µ0). The one loop diagram, shown in
Fig. 5(a), gives the following contribution to λ(µ),

where µ is the floating cutoff. The factor of 3/2 arises from: a 1/2 from the Taylor expansion,
a 1/4! appearing in the interaction vertex, and a factor of
42×32
2
from the number of ways of
contracting the legs of the two interaction vertices to form a loop.
The leading divergence of an n-loop diagrams scales as (log µ)n. A diagram with n loops is
given by taking a diagram with n−1 loops and contracting it with a single vertex, in different
possible channels. We need to find the sum of all the leading log divergences at each order. Since
divergences are local, each loop can be contracted to a point, therefore, each diagram gives the same
contribution. So the problem is a simple counting exercise. Letting Λn denote the contribution to
λ(µ) associated with the sum of the leading log divergences of diagrams of order λn
0, we have the
recursion relation, see Fig. 5(b),
Λn+1 = −3

The sum over all n is just a geometric series, which gives λ(µ) = P∞
