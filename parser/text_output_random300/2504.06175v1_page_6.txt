FIG. 4. Results from simulation of recurrence with circuit noise described in Fig. 3a. Plots (4a) and (4b) show fractional change
in Bell fidelity, r (see eq. (15)), plotted against initial Bell fidelity Fb (defined below (15)) for various gate and measurement
errors, g and m, respectively. The region where the plot remain above r = 1 indicates where the noisy distillation circuit is
beneficial. Plots (4c) and (4d) focus on high fidelity Bell pairs and shows the percentage decrease in Bell infidelity (defined in
eq. (16)) plotted against initial fidelity Fb for various gate and measurement errors.
After the second barrier, the circuit applies a waiting er-
ror (via channel Λq acting on one half of each Bell pair),
and finally, it carries out the ZX3B distillation proto-
col (see Sec. II B).
The first plot in Fig. 5a describes the variation in the
ratio r as a function of the Fb for fixed gate and mea-
surement errors. All three Bell pairs have the same ini-
tial Bell fidelity. The variation in r and Fb with the gate
error g and measurement error m are similar to those in
Fig. 4a, described below eq. (15). For fixed g and m, the
ratio r in Fig. 5a is typically higher than those in Fig. 4a
when r > 1.
In addition, the value of Fb at which r
shifts from a value greater than one to a value less than
one is typically lower in Fig. 5a compared to Fig. 4a, i.e.,
the parameter region and amount by which distillation
provides an improvement seem to be typically larger in
Fig. 5a compared to Fig. 4a.
In Fig. 5b two of the Bell pairs, the first AA pair across
qubits 0−1 and third CC across qubits 4−5, have lower
Bell fidelity, than the second pair BB across 2 −3, i.e.
F1 = F3 < F2. The noise parameter p is such that the
initial Bell fidelity F1 = F3 = .975F2. As a result distilla-
tion protocol here can be seen as an attempt to improve
the fidelity of one Bell pair using two Bell pairs with
lower fidelity. Variation in improvement r and Fb with
the gate error g and measurement error m is similar to
those in Fig. 4b, described below eq. (15). For fixed g
and m, the ratio r in Fig. 5a can be higher higher than
those in Fig. 4b, however this need not be the case in
general, even when r > 1
The focus in Fig. 5c and 5d is on smaller gate and
measurement errors, g = 1 × 10−2 or 5 × 10−3 and
m = 5 × 10−2 or 1 × 10−2. As the error parameter q is
varied, we plot the percentage decrease in error against
the initial Bell fidelity Fb.
When the Bell pairs being
distilled have equal fidelity initially we find a 40% −50%
decrease in error, as shown in Fig. 5c. The decrease in
error is lower when the when Bell pairs have unequal Bell
fidelities initially, as shown in Fig. 5d; it is possible that
error increases if the initial Bell fidelities are made even
more unequal.
