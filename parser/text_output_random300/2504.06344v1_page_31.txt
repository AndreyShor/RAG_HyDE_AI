cal, in section 4.1, evidence, that when the number of constant holonomies of the tuned-T4
constant-F solution, 4gcd(k, r), is smaller than the number of moduli expected from the in-
dex theorem, 4r, the constant-F solutions represent only a measure-zero set of the moduli
space—in contrast to the gcd(k, r) = r case where the only self-dual solutions of charge r/N
are the constant-F ones, as we argued in section 3. In other words, there are 4r−4gcd(k, r)
extra moduli whose nonzero values correspond to self-dual deformations of the solution which
make its field strength xµ-dependent.
Here, we note that a similar problem also arises in SU(2) theories with Q = r
2, for any
integer r ≥2, as we describe in detail below. Little is known about these solutions from the
numerical side: with r ≥2 the minimum action lattice configuration is either the well-studied
one with Q = 1
2, if r is odd, or the trivial vacuum with Q = 0, if r is even. Thus, these
instantons “fall through” the lattice, complicating their numerical study.
On the other hand, on the analytic side,27 explicit constant-F solutions, for any r ≥2,
exist on tuned tori, such that ∆(r, 1, 1) = 0, or from (1.3), rL3L4 = L1L2. These are, of
course, given by our backgrounds of eqn. (2.7, 2.8) with k = ℓ= 1, N = 2, and the desired
value of r. Now, for any r ≥2, there are only 4 constant holonomies, the translational moduli
of the solution.
It stands to reason to expect that, as happened for the multi-fractional
instantons studied in section 4, there will be extra 4r −4 moduli, which, when turned on, will
correspond to non-constant self-dual solutions.
In what follows, we give an argument in favour of this, which goes beyond our leading-
order study of the self-duality condition of 4.1. At the outset, however, let us state that all we
shall be able to argue is that the right number of extra moduli appears and that the solution
becomes xµ-dependent. Any claims about the global structure of the moduli space (like for
the r = 2 example studied in [55]) remain beyond our current scope.
We begin by parameterizing the fluctuations around the constant-F solution (2.7, 2.8)
with k = ℓ= 1, N = 2, any r > 1, which is labelled ¯Aµ below. The fluctuations are similar
to (2.12), but simplify in the SU(2) case:
Aµ = ¯Aµ +

∂µSµ = 0, DµWµ = 0, D∗

where we imposed the gauge condition (2.16) with the background covariant derivative DµWν
defined in (2.19) (and with D∗
µW†
ν ≡(∂µ −i2πN ¯Aω

ν). We stress that we include the
constant holonomies ϕµ in the constant-F background ¯Aµ ≡ω ¯Aω
µ and use Sµ to denote only
x-dependent fluctuations in the Cartan direction. The field strength then has the form, as in
[1],

(4.12)
27The only other analytic result we know of refers to (in our language) Q = 1 instantons of SU(2) on the
twisted torus, arguing that, with the translational moduli factored out, the moduli space is a K3 surface [55].
