moments of the inclusive Ds 7→Xℓ¯νℓsemileptonic pro-
cess.
We have studied separately the different flavor
channels that contribute to the total rate and investi-
gated carefully all sources of systematic uncertainties.
Our quantitative analysis has shown that, at the present
level of accuracy, the Γ¯us contribution is negligible w.r.t
the dominating Γ¯cs and the Cabibbo-suppressed Γ¯cd con-
tributions.
Our final results for dM1,¯cs/dω2 and dM1,¯cd/dω2 are
shown in Figure 32 while the associated error-budgets
are shown in Figure 33. The corresponding plots for the
differential decay rate are shown in the companion pa-
per [1] while those for the second moment are shown in
appendix A. As it can be seen, our errors are statisti-
cally dominated and, therefore, the overall accuracy can
certainly be improved.
In order to obtain our predictions for M1, ¯
fg we per-
formed a numerical integration of the differential moment
dM1, ¯
fg/dω2. The same procedure has been used also in
the case of the rate and of the second moment. More
precisely, for each flavor channel we have interpolated
dM1, ¯
fg/dω2 which we have computed for the discrete set
of momenta listed in Table II. We used a cubic spline (see
Ref. [47] and references therein for further information)
by sampling the interval

0, |ω|max

uniformly with 200
points. The endpoints of the interval have been included
in the sampled set.
Notice that the points above the
largest simulated momentum (respectively 0.42 and 0.45
for the ¯cs and ¯cd channels) up to |ω|max
¯
F G have been ex-
trapolated. We imposed the theoretical constraint that
the differential decay rate has to vanish for |ω| = 0. The
filled bands in Figure 32 are the results of these interpo-
lations.
The interpolated points have then been used to perform
the numerical integration by applying both the trapezoid
method and the Simpson’s rule. The difference between
the two results is totally negligible w.r.t. our statistical
errors and, therefore, we do not quote below a systematic
error associated with this step of the analysis. Finally,
the integrated results are multiplied by the respective
normalization factors9 ¯Γ, ¯
M1 and ¯
M2. The results with
errors for the three observables and for the two channels
are given in Table IV.
By using the current best estimates of the relevant CKM
matrix elements from Ref. [46] (namely |Vcs| = 0.975(6)
and |Vcd| = 0.221(4)) and by combining the results of
Table IV we get
Γ = 8.72(56) × 10−14 GeV ,
M1 = 0.456(22) GeV ,
M2 = 0.227(10) GeV2 .

Our first-principles theoretical results compare very well
with the corresponding experimental results, obtained by
the CLEO [3] and BES-III [4] collaborations,

The experimental results for the decay rate have been
obtained by using the experimental branching-ratios as
explained in appendix B. The experimental results for
the lepton-energy moments have been obtained by re-
peating also in the case of the BES-III data the analysis
performed in Ref. [48] in the case of the CLEO results.
The analysis of the phenomenological implications of our
theoretical results is the subject of the companion pa-
per [1]. The main goal of this work was to provide robust
evidence concerning the fact that inclusive semileptonic
decays of heavy mesons can nowadays be studied on the
lattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy.
Given the very careful analysis of all sources of system-
atic errors that we described in the previous sections,
and given the very good agreement of our first-principles
lattice results with the available experimental determi-
nations, we can state with confidence that the goal has
been reached.
As already stressed, the total error of our results is dom-
inated by the statistical uncertainty and, therefore, it
