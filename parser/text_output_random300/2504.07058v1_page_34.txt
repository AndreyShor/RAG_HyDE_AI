Since 𝐸(𝑈𝑛) is non-increasing, it follows that
𝐸(𝑈𝑛) ⩽𝐸(𝑈𝑛) ⩽𝐶(𝑈𝑛(0)).

Thus,

By the Sobolev embedding theorem, this implies the uniform bound:
∥𝑈𝑛(𝑡)∥∞⩽𝐶′,

This establishes the uniform boundedness:
{∆𝑈𝑛}𝑛∈N is uniformly bounded in 𝐿2([0,𝑇]; 𝐻2(D)).

Taking the time derivative of both sides,

(5.47)
Applying Gr¨onwall’s inequality, we conclude the boundedness of 𝑈𝑛
𝑡. Thus, by integrating in time, the uniform
boundedness follows. Combining with the Aubin-Lions compactness theorem and the uniform boundedness of {𝑈𝑛},
{∆𝑈𝑛}, and {𝜕𝑡𝑈𝑛}, there exists a subsequence of {𝑈𝑛}𝑛∈N (still denoted by {𝑈𝑛}𝑛∈N), which converges to some
function
𝑈∈𝐶([0,𝑇]; 𝐻2(D)) ∩𝐿2([0,𝑇]; 𝐻4(D)).
(5.48)
Moreover, 𝑈𝑛converges strongly to 𝑈in 𝐿2(D). By the Arzel`a-Ascoli theorem, 𝑈𝑛uniformly converges to 𝑈in D.
Appendix E.4 (Lemma). Under Assumption (H1), if 𝑢0 ∈𝐻2(D), then the EFK equation (2.10) admits a unique
solution 𝑢on [0,𝑇] satisfying
𝑢∈𝐶([0,𝑇]; 𝐻2(D)) ∩𝐿2(0,𝑇; 𝐻4(D)).
Appendix E.5 (Lemma). Under Assumption (H2), let 𝑢0 ∈𝐻1(D), then the Burgess equation (2.10) has a unique
solution 𝑢on [0,𝑇] such that
𝑢∈𝐶([0,𝑇]; 𝐻1(D)) ∩𝐿2([0,𝑇]; 𝐻2(D)).
