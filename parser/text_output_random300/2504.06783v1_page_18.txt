Observation-based data and reanalysis products 
To assess GMOC variability, we utilize Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) volume 
transport observations from the RAPID-MOCHA array (Feb. 2004–Dec. 2021) at 26.5° N in the Atlantic [55], 
along with volume transport data from the Meridional Overturning Variability Experiment (MOVE) mooring 
observations (Jan. 2000–Jan. 2018) at 16° N in the western Atlantic and the North Atlantic Changes (NOAC) 
array (Jan. 1993–Dec. 2018) at 47° N [56]. Mid-depth (950–1150 m) ocean current velocities estimated by 
CDA are evaluated using Argo float displacement data [34] from the Argo New Displacements Rannou and 
Ollitrault dataset [57]. Climatological data for ocean temperature and salinity from the WOA, as well as 
monthly EN4.2.2 temperature and salinity datasets (referred to as EN4) [35], are used for further evaluation. 
Ocean reanalysis products used for comparison included the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3.4.2 
(denoted as SODA3) for the period 1980–2019 [58], Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean 
version 4 release 3 (denoted as ECCO4) for the period 1992–2015 [59] from the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, and Ocean Reanalysis System 5 (ORAS5) for the period 1958–2022 [60] from the 
ECWMF. Additionally, ERA5 atmosphere reanalysis data from 1945 onwards are incorporated. Detailed 
information on these reanalysis datasets is provided in Table S2. 
 
Definition of GMOC and associated indices 
Global meridional overturning circulation. The stream function of GMOC is defined as zonally integrated 
volume transport, measured in Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3/s), from the depth level z to the ocean surface ŋ at latitude y 
[10,25,30]. It can be expressed as: 
𝛹(𝑦, 𝑧) = ∫∫
𝑣(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧)𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑧
𝑥𝐸
𝑥𝑊
ŋ

where, v represents the meridional velocity, and xW and xE denote the western and eastern boundaries of the 
global ocean, respectively. 
GMOC index. Given that the spatial patterns of the principal component (PC) obtained through empirical 
orthogonal function (EOF) analysis are not consistent across different models, we employ a novel method to 
define the GMOC index. The GMOC index is defined as the linear regression coefficient of the instantaneous 
time slice (monthly in this case) GMOC state over the temporal mean distribution of the CDA mean state. The 
formula is expressed as: 
𝐺𝑚𝑜𝑐= 𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝐺𝑡, 𝐺𝑚)
𝜎𝐺𝑡∗𝜎𝐺𝑚
