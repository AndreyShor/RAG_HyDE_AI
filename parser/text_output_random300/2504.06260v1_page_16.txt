**GEOMETRY:** * The domain is a cylindrical section defined by:
• Inner radius: 0.02 m
• Outer radius: 0.1 m
• Height: 0.14 m
* The geometry represents a 2D cross-section of this cylinder, with the width corre-
sponding to the difference between the inner and outer cylindrical surfaces.
**LOADING:** * A constant heat flux of 5e5 W/m2 is applied to the inner cylindrical
surface, between z = 0.04 m and z= 1 m. The remaining portion of the inner cylindrical
surface is insulated.
**BOUNDARY CONDITIONS:** * The outer cylindrical surface, top surface, and
bottom surface have a uniform temperature of 273.15 [K].
**MATERIAL PROPERTIES:** * Thermal conductivity (k): 52 W/(m·K)
**ELEMENT TYPES:** The analysis can utilize 2D axisymmetric heat transfer ele-
ments.
**MESHES:** The default mesh can be used.
**OUTPUT:** The analysis should determine the temperature in Kelvins [K] (Kelvins
are the default units) at a specific point on the inner cylindrical surface:
* Radial Coordinate (r): 0.04 m * Axial Coordinate (z): 0.04 m

* **Study Type:** Choose ”General Studies > Stationary”.
**2. Geometry Definition:**
* **Rectangle:** Create a rectangle representing the cross-section of the cylinder:
* Width: 0.08 m
* Height: 0.14 m
* Corner Position: (r, z) = (0.02, 0) m
* **Point:**
