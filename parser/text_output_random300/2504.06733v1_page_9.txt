Separated, but connected: Ar@C60/Ag(111)
Arguably the most compelling experimental evidence for mixing of the photoexcited
Ar 4s state with the surrounding fullerene cage comes from our measurements of a
chemisorbed monolayer of Ar@C60 on Ag(111), in concert with ground state periodic
projector augmented wave DFT (PAW-DFT) calculations (see Methods.) We first
focus on the measurement of the Ar atom position with respect to the Ag(111) surface
via the X-ray standing wave technique (Fig. 4). NIXSW is an exceptionally powerful
probe of adsorbate geometry[20], and is especially well-suited for endofullerene sys-
tems. Two key parameters result from an NIXSW measurement: the coherent fraction,
fc, a measure of the level of order in the adsorbate positions, and the coherent posi-
tion, pc – the position of the adsorbate with respect to the substrate scattering plane.
Our deposition protocol (see Methods) results in a value of fc for the encapsulated
argon in the Ar@C60 monolayer that is close to unity: 0.92± 0.05, signifying a highly
ordered molecular layer. The value of 5.54 ± 0.04 ˚A for the argon atom height above
the Ag(111) surface determined from the NIXSW analysis (Fig. 4) is identical to
both the value predicted by our PAW-DFT calculations (5.55 ˚A; see Fig. 4, Methods,
and S.I.) and the 5.5 ±0.1 ˚A found by Pussi et al.[52] (from a LEED analysis) for

wave profile derived from the variation in the Ar 2p3/2 photoemission yield for an Ar@C60 monolayer
on Ag(111) is shown as the blue open circles in the main plot. A least squares fit to this profile (red
line) (see Methods) yields an Ar-Ag(111) separation of 5.54±0.04 ˚A, placing the Ar atom at the centre
of the cage, despite the strong interaction of the surrounding fullerene with the Ag(111) surface. This
separation is identical within experimental uncertainty to the Ar-Ag(111) adsorption height of 5.55 ˚A
predicted by our (inset to right) ground state PAW-DFT calculations for the 6:6 on-top geometry
of the fullerene cage. Inset to left: (2
