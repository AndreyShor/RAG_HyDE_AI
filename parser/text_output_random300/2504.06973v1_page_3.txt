Johanna Müller-Horn et al.: HIP 15429: a newborn Be star on an eccentric binary orbit
in overlapping wavelength regions. The data span 498 d (2.25
orbital periods) from MJD 59890 to 60388 (11/07/2022 to
03/19/2024).
Furthermore, we obtained five spectra with the HIRES in-
strument (Vogt et al. 1994) on the Keck I telescope at the W. M.
Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea. The data were obtained and
reduced using the standard California Planet Survey (CPS) set-
up (Howard et al. 2010), with resolving power R ≃55000 and in
three wavelength bands; approximately 3700–4800, 5000-6400
and 6550-8000 Å.
We further analysed eight spectra with R ≃85000 and wave-
length coverage 3800–9000 Å taken with the High-Efficiency
and high-Resolution Mercator Echelle Spectrograph (HERMES)
instrument, which is mounted on the 1.2-m Mercator Telescope
at the Roque de los Muchachos observatory on La Palma, Spain
(Raskin et al. 2011). Standard calibrations for this data set were
performed with the HERMES data reduction pipeline (Raskin
et al. 2011). Spectra were rebinned to a lower resolution (R ≃
64000) to increase signal-to-noise ratios (S/N). We combined
three of the observations that were obtained during the same
night to further improve S/N, using a S/N-weighted average.
We performed continuum normalisation individually for all
37 spectra. To do so, we used the Python package SciPy (Vir-
tanen et al. 2020) and fitted cubic splines to wavelength pix-
els in continuum regions. We followed the approach outlined
by El-Badry & Quataert (2021) to determine suitable spline an-
chor points in spectral regions without significant emission or
absorption. A barycentric correction was applied to all spec-
tra. The wavelength calibration between the data sets from the
three instruments was verified using the interstellar Na absorp-
tion lines at 5890 and 5896 Å. We estimated S/N empirically
from the pixel-to-pixel scatter in regions without strong absorp-
tion or emission lines. The dates of all observations, typical S/N
at 4500 Å, and RVs, measured as described in Sect. 4, are listed
in Table A.1 in the Appendix.
3. Spectral variability
HIP 15429 (V=9.75 mag, Hiltner 1956) was observed as part of
the low-resolution spectral catalogue by Jacoby et al. (1984) and
identified as a B5Ib supergiant, a classification later confirmed
by Navarro et al. (2012). Its binary nature was reported with a
spectroscopic solution (SB1) published in the Gaia DR3 non-
single-star catalogue (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2023a). We point
out two peculiarities about the multi-epoch spectra of HIP 15429
considering the suggested classification.
First, the spectra exhibit disk emission features in the form
of broad, double, and triple-peaked emission in the Balmer lines.
The emission is most prominent in Hα, where it was also ob-
served by Jacoby et al. (1984) and Navarro et al. (2012). Al-
though there is clear orbit-induced variability in the narrow metal
lines in the spectra, the Balmer emission appears to be nearly sta-
tionary, with potentially a small antiphase motion in the wings
of the lines. This is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1 where two
TRES spectra are plotted close to quadrature, that is, close to the
phase of maximum velocity separation.
Secondly, the strengths of the metal absorption lines seem
to differ from those of known blue supergiants. In particular,
the carbon and oxygen lines in HIP 15429 appear much weaker
than expected. This is indicated in Fig. 2 where we compare

Fig. 1: Top: Balmer emission lines at quadrature. Two TRES
spectra taken close to quadrature (red and blue lines) and one
spectrum close to the system’s barycentric velocity (grey line).
The grey dotted lines indicate the rest-frame wavelengths of the
Balmer Hα and carbon C II 6572 lines. Orbital motion of the
narrow-lined star is apparent from wavelength shifts in the C II
lines, whereas the Hα line shows variable emission line profiles.
Bottom: Short-term variability of emission line profiles. Three
TRES spectra observed at t = MJD 60235, t+5 d and t+9 d, that
is, spanning < 5% of the orbital period. Solid grey, red and blue
lines show the variable Hα emission line profiles. The rest-frame
wavelength of Hα is shown as in the top panel. Narrow lines at
6574, 6577 Å originate from variable telluric absorption.
HIP 15429 to spectra of the B5Ia supergiant Eta Canis Majoris1,
listed as a B5Ia standard star in Gray & Corbally (2009) and
assumed to be of similar temperature, surface gravity and com-
parable metallicity as HIP 15429.
Together, these spectral features already hint at a post-
interaction binary nature of the system (see e.g.„ Marchant &
Bodensteiner 2023; Ramachandran et al. 2024). In this scenario,
the observed spectra would be superpositions of the spectra of
the binary components, featuring a narrow-lined, stripped star
resembling a B5 supergiant and a fast-rotating, broad-lined com-
panion with disk emission.
The strength of Balmer emission and the shape of the line
wings remain approximately constant throughout the observed
period, but the central emission line profiles show substantial
variability on short time scales (∼a few days). The lower panel
