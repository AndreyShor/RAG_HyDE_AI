FIG. 6. Microwave sequence to control the KRb number density. (a) Shelving sequence to partially remove KRb molecules.
Ground state molecules were first partially driven to the first rotational excited state. The remaining molecules in the ground
state were then removed, after which we transferred the excited molecules back to the ground state.
(b) The remaining
molecule number vs the rotation angle θ on the Bloch sphere. The result is fitted to a sinusoidal function, as expected for a
Rabi oscillation. The number of returning molecules is extracted from absorption imaging, with error bars reflecting uncertainty
in the number of imaged molecules.
We used a microwave shelving scheme to control the KRb density by partially removing KRb molecules from the
cloud, as shown in Fig. 6(a). We started with KRb molecules in the ground rotation state. A microwave pulse drove
the molecules to a superposition state between |N = 0⟩and |N = 1⟩, corresponding to a θ rotation on the Bloch
sphere. We removed the |N = 0⟩KRb molecules using a reversed STIRAP pulse to drive the molecules to weakly-
bound Feshbach states. These weakly bound molecules, along with part of the Rb and all K atoms, were removed by
resonant laser pulses. Through varying the duration of the first θ-rotation pulse, we control the number of molecules
in the ensemble between 0 and 7.69 ×103, corresponding to a peak molecular density between 0 and 3.38 × 1011/cm3,
as shown in Fig. 6(b).

Rydberg excitation linewidth versus Rb atom density.
We fitted the Rydberg excitation spectra to a Lorentzian
function and extracted their FWHM linewidths using the same method as in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 of the main text. The KRb
density was kept at the highest achievable value of 4.29 × 1011/cm3, identical to conditions used in main text Fig. 3.
