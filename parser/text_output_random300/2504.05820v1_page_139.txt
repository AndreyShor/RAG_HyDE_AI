namely aN3LO for anomalous dimensions and DIS coefficient functions and NNLO for hadronic
processes. The scale variation then is automatically larger and suitable deweights processes for
which N3LO corrections are not available. The possibility of simultaneously including in a PDF
determination processes for which theory predictions are only available at different perturbative
orders is an advantage of the inclusion of MHOUs in the PDF determination, as already pointed
out in Refs. [317, 20].
4.3. NNPDF4.0 at aN3LO
We now present the aN3LO NNPDF4.0 PDF sets. They have been obtained by using the dataset
and methodology discussed in [109] and reviewed in Section 2.2. The aN3LO results are
obtained using the approximate N3LO splitting functions of Section 4.1, the exact massless
and approximate massive N3LO coefficient functions of Section 4.2.1, and NNLO hadronic
cross-sections supplemented by an extra uncertainty as per Section 4.2.3.
