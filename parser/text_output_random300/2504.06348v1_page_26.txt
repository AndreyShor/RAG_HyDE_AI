Algorithm for initial state preparation
4.4.1
Quantum algorithm for initial state preparation
We present a quantum algorithm to prepare the initial state ansatz in Eq. (62). The classical precomputations
required for the input are reviewed in Sec. 4.4.2. For each of the S molecular species, the pseudoion DoFs
are described in their respective natural product basis
|Rs
CoM⟩⊗|Ss⟩⊗|qs⟩,
s = 0, . . . , S
(66)
where |Rs
CoM⟩are eigenstates of the CoM position operator, |Ss⟩is a basis of L2(RP3) (square integrable
functions with, for example, coordinates being Euler angles), and |qs⟩= |qs,1, ..., qs,3ηs
ion−6⟩is the basis of
vibrational normal modes for each species s (for linear molecules there are 2 rotations, and a shape basis
|qs⟩= |qs,1, ..., qs,3ηs
ion−5⟩). All of these basis components are suitably discretized. The discretization used
in the initial state preparation is not the same as the plane wave discretization used in the simulation, and
so requires a discussion of “grid-matching” in Sec. 4.4.2.

(67)
where, as before, ¯Rs, ¯Ps, σs are the reaction-geometry-specified mean position, mean momentum, and spatial
uncertainty of the wavepacket. We have taken the spatial uncertainty σs to be equal in all directions. Each
of the three components of Rs
CoM takes values on a uniform cubic grid with ntrans qubit discretization per
dimension (corresponding to Ntrans = 2ntrans points per direction). This state can be created using O(ntrans)
gates by known methods such as quantum rejection sampling as discussed in Ref. [75]. In practice, this cost
will be dwarfed by the rest of the algorithm and is hence neglected.
Rotations
The ground state of the rigid rotor Hamiltonian is the uniform superposition over all rotational configurations
(Ref. [72], Problem 11-2) and hence it is rotationally invariant. We use an extrinsic Euler angle representation
of SO(3) rotations with angles α, γ ∈[−π, π), β ∈[0, π] such that a general rotation can be written as
S(α, β, γ) = Sˆa(α)Sˆb(β)Sˆa(γ) where Sˆn(θ) is the 3d matrix for a rotation of angle θ about axis ˆn, and ˆa,ˆb
are any two independent axis. Classically, uniform sampling over SO(3) can be accomplished by generating
uniform random variables u1, u2, u3 ∈[−1, 1] and creating (α, β, γ) = (πu1, cos−1(u2), πu3). We mimic this
spirit for state preparation. Let USP(a, b; n) be a unitary that creates from the n qubit all zeroes state a
uniform superposition over 2n states labeling a uniform discretization of the interval [a, b):
USP(a, b; n)|0⟩=

For a nrot qubit resolution in each Euler angle we obtain,
|grot

(69)
where Nrot = 23nrot/2, and un[a, b) denotes the set of 2n points obtained by uniform discretization of the
corresponding interval [a, b).
For linear molecules, there are only 2 unique angles and so we just omit
preparation of the γ angle above. This state preparation only involves 3nrot Hadamard gates, whose cost is
completely negligible.
