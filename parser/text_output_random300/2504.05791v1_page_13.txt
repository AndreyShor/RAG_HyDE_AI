(b) Illusion spaces change with physical angles. Results are from phys-
ical objects 2 and 4 (sizes: 6cm, angles: 8° and 16°)
Figure 8: Results of illusion space changes with sizes (a, left) and angles (b, right).
illusion space of this specific physical object and the vertices are
the smallest-least tilted, smallest-most tilted, largest-least tilted and
largest-most tilted virtual objects in its illusion space. Other borders
of the illusion space can also be calculated from the mathematic
expression.
In order to support designers’ use of these equations and find-
ings, we provide a code tool that allows for the easy calculation of
the perception thresholds given the properties of physical objects,
and as such what virtual objects a physical object can represent.
Similarly, the tool enables physical object requirements to be deter-
mined from known virtual properties4.

Discussion
In this study we estimated how perceptual thresholds are coupled
for size and taper angle and built complex, multi-dimensional illu-
sion spaces. In this section, we discuss what we learn from these
illusion spaces and how they may be useful to the VR haptics com-
munity.

Key Findings from the Illusion Spaces
For size perception, we generally perceive physical objects to be
larger than they are, and virtual size differences of -0.5cm to +1cm
from the physical sizes will go unnoticed in most cases. This pro-
vides a general starting estimate of a physical object’s perceptual
limits. From our results of 3cm-8°, 6cm-8° and 9cm-8° in Fig. 5, PSEs

are closer to the true size of the object when the physical ob-
jects are large or small in size, than when they are of medium
size. Our work confirms Bergström et al. [6]’s findings that the
ranges of the illusion spaces decrease with the increase of physical
sizes. This suggests that, towards the maximal extent of our grasp-
ing range, we are more sensitive to objects’ size, than when our
fingers are closer together and grasping smaller objects.
Taper angles are generally underestimated and objects will be
perceived as less titled than they actually are. When sizes are con-
gruent (between physical and virtual objects), an angle incongru-
ence of ±2° from the physical angle is typically not noticeable. Again,
these could form starting estimates for an object’s perceptual limits.
PSEs are closer to the physical object’s taper angles when ob-
jects are smaller or larger, than when they are medium-sized.
Additionally, as the physical taper angle increases, we need
greater changes in order to perceive any difference (the JND
increases), while the PSE for size perception gets closer to the true
size of the object, as shown in the results of the 6cm-0°, 6cm-8° and
6cm-16° objects in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.
For the angle perception in Figure 7, the thresholds and PSE all
show an increasing trend when the virtual sizes are larger, which
means as the virtual sizes increase, we perceive that the taper
angle increases and it becomes more difficult to notice the
angle incongruence. On the other hand, for size perception, the
thresholds and PSE also show trends with the change of virtual
angles. When the virtual angle decreases, we increasingly
overestimate the size of the physical object. These facts show
