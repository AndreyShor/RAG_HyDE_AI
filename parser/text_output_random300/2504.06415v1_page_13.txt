To make a fair comparison with other studies, we at-
tempt to statistically correct for the lensed quasar con-
tamination in the final double quasar sample. An accu-
rate estimation of the lensed quasar contribution in the
pair sample is currently infeasible, as it requires detailed
follow-up observations. Here we simply assume a dual-
to-lens ratio of 1:1, as suggested by some models (Oguri
& Marshall 2010). This ratio is a statistical correction
for comparison purposes and may differ from the actual
lens fractions, leading to some uncertainties. However,
if the true dual:lens ratio were 2:1 or 1:2, the corrected
dual fractions would shift up or down only by 33%, and
our conclusions on the redshift trend remain the same.
The corrected dual quasar fractions for pair complete-
ness and lensed quasar contamination as a function of
redshift are shown as the blue curve in Figure 9. To en-
sure consistency with previous studies (discussed below),
all uncertainties in Figure 9 are represented as Poisson
errors rather than bootstrap uncertainties. We set the
bin size to ∆z = 0.5 for double quasars with z ≤3.5 and
combine those at z > 3.5 into a single bin due to their
small numbers. Figure 9 shows weak redshift evolution
from z = 0.5 to z = 3.5, consistent with our previous
findings in Figure 8.
We also compare our results with other observational
studies that also target luminous unobscured quasar
pairs (Silverman et al. 2020; Shen et al. 2023a). Shen
et al. (2023a) selected double quasars using a simi-
lar method to our study but used Gaia EDR3 data
with different redshift and magnitude thresholds (z >
1.5 and G < 20.25), and found a cumulative double
quasar fraction (uncorrected for the dual-to-lens ratio)
of 6.2 ± 0.5 × 10−4 among z > 1.5 quasars, as shown in
Figure 9 but corrected for a dual-to-lens ratio of 1:1 to
estimate the dual quasar (physically-associated quasar
pairs) fraction. Shen et al. (2023a) also divided their
sample at ⟨z⟩= 2 and presented double quasar frac-
tions of 6.6 ± 1.2 × 10−4 and 5.9 ± 1.0 × 10−4 in the
lower (⟨z⟩= 1.7) and higher (⟨z⟩= 2.4) redshift bins,
which also shows no strong redshift evolution. The re-
sults in Shen et al. (2023a) are similar to this work in
both fraction and redshift evolution trend, suggesting
minimal redshift evolution
Silverman et al. (2020) identified dual quasar can-
didates around luminous SDSS quasars using Subaru
HSC imaging, employing color selection. Briefly speak-
ing, luminous dual AGNs at z ≤3.5 with separations
of 5–30 kpc are selected, where the primary AGN has
Lbol ≥1045.3 erg/s, and the secondary AGN (candi-
date) contributes at least 10% of the primary’s lumi-
nosity (Lbol > 1044.3 erg/s).
Silverman et al. (2020)
reported a success rate of 3 dual quasars out of 6 candi-
dates, but a later follow-up (Tang et al. 2021) identified
3 dual quasars out of 26 additional sources. The plot-
ted double quasar fraction adopted from their work is
corrected by the the overall success rate (6 dual quasars
out of 32 candidates) based on the follow-up study in
Silverman et al. (2020) and Tang et al. (2021).
The results from Silverman et al. (2020) and Tang
et al. (2021) are generally consistent with our find-
ings within 1σ, and also indicate little redshift evolu-
tion. However, the double quasar fractions in Silverman
et al. (2020) and Tang et al. (2021) are about 0.2 dex
higher than those reported in Shen et al. (2023a) and
in this work. This small difference may arise from the
lower secondary luminosity threshold of Lbol > 1044.3
erg/s adopted in Silverman et al. (2020), while Shen
et al. (2023a) and our work adopt Lbol > 1045.8 and
Lbol > 1044.5 erg/s to both the primary and secondary
quasars, respectively.
The dual AGN fraction is gen-
erally lower for the higher-luminosity cut, as suggested
by the simulations and observations (Chen et al. 2023a;
Shen et al. 2023a; Li et al. 2024).
In Figure 9, we follow Section 3.2.1 in Puerto-S´anchez
et al. (2025) and compare our results with large-scale
cosmological simulations, including Illustris (Genel et al.
2014; Vogelsberger et al. 2014), TNG100, TNG300
(Pillepich et al. 2018), and Horizon-AGN (HAGN;
Dubois et al. 2016; Volonteri et al. 2016), using the ob-
servational constraints as presented in Silverman et al.
(2020).
Specifically, Puerto-S´anchez et al. (2025) ap-
plies the same luminosity thresholds and further requires
black hole masses of MBH ≥108M⊙and host galaxy
masses of M∗≥1010M⊙, similar to the properties of
the follow-up confirmed dual quasar systems in Silver-
man et al. (2020). Poisson errors for each simulation
are included.
Some simulations, such as Illustris and
HAGN, do not show strong redshift evolution, whereas
others do predict a declining trend (e.g., the TNG sim-
ulations show a decrease of approximately 0.5 −1 dex
toward lower redshifts). However, this declining evolu-
tion is either absent or much weaker in the observational
results (Silverman et al. 2020; Shen et al. 2023a).
In addition, simulated dual quasar fractions are typi-
cally higher than our observed values by ∼0.8–1.6 dex,
depending on the simulation. The discrepancy can be
attributed to several factors.
First, Puerto-S´anchez
et al. (2025) adopt the selection criteria from Silver-
man et al. (2020) using a slightly brighter luminosity
threshold for the secondary quasar, which may yield
higher fractions than ours.
Second, Puerto-S´anchez
et al. (2025) include all dual quasars in the simulations,
whereas the observational studies mentioned above fo-
cus only on bright, unobscured dual quasars.
