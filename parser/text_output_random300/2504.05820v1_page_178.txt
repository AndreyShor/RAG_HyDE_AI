Figure 5.7
By comparing our NLO determination with the previous release of the NNPDF collabora-
tion [331], we can infer what are the impact of the new methodology and of the extended
dataset coverage. Fig. 5.7 reports the same comparison of Fig. 5.6, but now for the NLO set
without MHOU and NNPDFPOL1.1. Overall we observe good consistency of the two results.
The singlet PDF is almost identical to the one of the previous study. This is a non-trivial finding
that can be back traced to having included in the fits a very similar information on the DIS
structure functions. Moreover, this suggests that, in the case where large number of datapoints
are available, the impact of the new hyperopt scan is also limited as verified also in Ref [367].
The situation is different for the gluon PDF, which is mainly constrained by the jet data. Indeed,
∆g displays smaller uncertainties for NNPDFPOL2.0, in the region 10−2 ≤x ≤0.2, due to the
inclusion of the larger and more accurate STAR measurements of the jets and dijet asymmetries.
In the case of non-singlet distributions, for e.g. ∆V , we can distinguish a different behavior of
the new fit in the small- and large-x regions. This is originated from the proper inclusion of the
W-asymmetries into the fitting framework and to the addition of the valence-like PDFs ∆V, ∆V3
as true degree of freedom of our fits. In NNPDFPOL1.1 the DY asymmetries where included
only by means of Bayesian reweighting with the starting valence-like PDFs assumed to be equal
of a specific prior functional form. Thus, we can appreciate that in our new ∆V determination,
uncertainties are larger in the extrapolation region (small-x), while are slightly improved in the
peak region which is the kinematic interval more correlated to the W-asymmetries.
