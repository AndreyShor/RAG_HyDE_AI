fractional topological charge are responsible for nonperturbative gauge theory phenomena
such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. This has been shown in many cases using
reliable semiclassics, sometimes combined with insight from lattice studies [11–14]. The topic
is reviewed in [15, 16] and is still under intense scrutiny, including on the lattice, see [17–19].
Instantons of fractional topological charge Q =
r
N in SU(N) gauge theories on T4 were
discovered by ’t Hooft [2, 3], who found explicit solutions with commuting constant field
strength [4] but nonabelian transition functions, as reviewed in [20]. Further studies were
slowed by the lack of explicit solutions for more general—nonabelian, with space-time depen-
dent field strength—instantons. These had to be studied using numerical techniques [21, 22].
An important advance in the study of fractional instantons was the introduction [23] of
an analytic technique for finding self-dual, or minimum action, fractional instantons via an
expansion in a small parameter ∆, the asymmetry parameter of T4. This “∆-expansion”
technique, further developed in [24, 25] and [1], shall be important in our discussions below.
The (multi-) fractional instantons1 found in [1, 23, 25] were used by two of the authors
of this paper in the semiclassical calculation of the (higher-order) gaugino condensates in
super-Yang-Mills theory on a small twisted-T4 [26, 27]. After understanding many subtle
points, see [27], we found complete agreement with the weak-coupling semiclassical R4 and
R3 × S1 results for the gaugino condensates (see [28, 29] and the review [30]) and the recent
independent large-N lattice determination [31]. We stress that our completion of a calculation
first attempted 40 years ago [32] was only possible after the recent understanding of both the
relevant generalized anomalies in the Hamiltonian framework [8] and the somewhat intricate
multi-fractional instanton moduli space [1, 27].
Another recent observation involving fractional instantons is that seemingly different
objects of fractional topological charge, such as center vortices and monopole-instantons,
shown to be responsible for semiclassical confinement in different geometries with small2
compact spaces, R × T3, R3 × S1, or R2 × T2 [9–14], are smoothly related to each other by
taking different limits of twists and T4 periods [33–39]. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, center
vortices and monopole-instantons have long ago been argued to be relevant for confinement,
even outside of the semiclassical regime, as described in e.g. the monograph [40]. The novelty
here is their embedding in a rich framework of intertwined semiclassically-calculable regimes.
Apart from the obvious advantage of being analytic, the semiclassical approach allows the
study of a range of gauge theories, notably ones with fermions in different representations
[41–46], which are difficult and prohibitively expensive to access via lattice simulations.
In summary, we believe that the developments mentioned above clearly motivate the need for
better understanding of fractional instantons and their role in gauge dynamics.
1We call instantons with Q = r/N and r > 1 “multi-fractional.” In an analytic study using the ∆-expansion
they resemble an “instanton liquid,” comprised of r strongly overlapping identical constituents [1].
2Of size L such that LΛ ≪1, where Λ is the gauge theory strong coupling scale. In addition to L being
small, depending on the matter content of the theory, one requires a double-trace deformation potential or a
’t Hooft flux to ensure semiclassical calculability.
