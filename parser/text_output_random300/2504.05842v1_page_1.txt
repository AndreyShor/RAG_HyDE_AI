Abstract
In recent years scale invariant scattering theory provided the ﬁrst exact access to the
magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional statistical systems with quenched disorder.
We show how the theory extends to the overlap variables entering the characterization of
spin glass properties. The resulting exact ﬁxed point equations yield both the magnetic
and, for the ﬁrst time, the spin glass renormalization group ﬁxed points. For the case of
the random bond Ising model, on which we focus, the spin glass subspace of solutions is
found to contain a line of ﬁxed points. We discuss the implications of the results for Ising
spin glass criticality and compare with the available numerical results.
