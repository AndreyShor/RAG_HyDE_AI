Although we did not evaluate SAM-GT on resource-constrained devices, it can generate the
JSON files using a regular general-purpose personal computer. One practical deployment of the
cyber-physical models is to integrate SAM-GT’s code to an energy management system (EMS) host,
such as the next-generation cyber-physical EMS proposed in [22]. This EMS currently supports one
test case with one topology: the Texas-2000 bus model with star topology. Thus, integrating SAM-
GT in this cyber-physical EMS will allow researchers to model and study multiple cyber-physical
test cases with the option to select topology based on research needs.
