β and are the result of solutions to equation α + βξ −ξ3 = 0, which is equal
to the Cardan discriminant δ = 27α −4β3 (Grasman et al., 2010). Cardan’s
discriminant differentiates between unimodal (δ ≤0) and bimodal cases (δ > 0).
Equation 1 is a dynamic deterministic equation that serves as the foundation
of the catastrophe model. However, to account for the inherent unpredictability
of real-world fertility scenarios, a stochastic component is incorporated into
this deterministic equation. This enhancement enables the estimation of a
catastrophe function using real population data. By combining deterministic
and stochastic elements, the dynamical system becomes more comprehensive
and better suited for capturing the complexities of real-world fertility scenarios.
The deterministic model 3 can be extended to represent a stochastic process
if a Wiener white noise term dW(t), associated with a Gaussian probability
distribution with a variance σ2, is added to −∂V (ξ; α, β)/∂ξ to obtain the
stochastic differential equation:
dξ = −∂V (ξ; α, β)
∂ξ
dt + dW(t).

Figure 1: Left: Response surface of the fertility model based on catastrophic
morphogenesis. The model takes into account the effects of X traditional
fertility factors, as well as catastrophic shocks (Z). Right: state-space of
control parameters of the model: α and β.
Figure 1 (right) shows combinations of values of the control parameters
α and β. The curves in the plane represent the distribution of the number
of pregnancies ξ for different values of the control parameters. Unimodality
and bimodality of the number of pregnancies ξ is observed for different values
of α and β. The parameter α ∈R controls the asymmetry of the number
