the AC and SQ samples, indicating some chemical inhomogeneity. The authors suggest
that this phenomenon is related to the formation of the non-stoichiometric Nb3Pt
phase in the AC and SQ samples. In the SQA sample, which exhibits the lowest Tc,
the growth of the s phase at elevated annealing temperatures is inferred. The M–H
hysteresis loops measured at 4.2 K are shown in Fig. 25(a). The AN sample exhibits a
signiﬁcantly larger hysteresis loop area compared to the other samples. Figure 25(b)
compares the magnetic ﬁeld performance of Jc for all samples, with the AN sample
demonstrating the best performance, achieving a self-ﬁeld Jc of 80 kA/cm2 at 4.2 K.
