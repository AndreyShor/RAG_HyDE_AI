where C is an undetermined constant and γ is an integration contour that has to be chosen such
that the hemisphere partition function converges in the given phase [45, 56]. The contribution from
the GLSM brane B is encoded in the brane factor fB(σ):
fB = TrMeiπr∗ρ(e2πσ).

Specialising to our model, we get
ZD2(B) =C

· eit(σ1+σ2+σ3)fB(σ).

The poles of the Gamma functions are at imaginary values of the σi.
Before we choose a specific brane, we consider some general properties of the hemisphere partition
function in the ζ ≫0 phase. We can choose an integration contour along real values of the σi.
Convergence of the integral then implies that we can close the integration contour at Imσi →∞.
Thus, the contour encloses the following poles of the Gamma functions:
iσi + q = −ki + εi,
i = 1, 2, 3,
ki ∈Z≥0.
(2.61)
The brane factor will not introduce further poles, but is can cancel some poles coming from the
Gamma functions. By standard manipulations, the hemisphere partition function can be rewritten
as

Here we have set q = 0 to match with the R-charges of the IR CFT. Evaluating this integral for
a choice of brane factor computes the exact central charge of the respective B-brane. It can be
expanded in terms of the mirror periods ϖ(LV )(φ) after taking into account the theta angle shift
t = −log φ + 3iπ between the GLSM and the NLSM of the phase.
The central charge of a D0-brane is proportional to the fundamental period ϖ(LV )
0
(φ) of the mirror.
For this type of examples, it is fairly straightforward to this read off from the hemisphere partition
function without explicitly specifying a D0-brane12. The integrand has third order poles in each
of the εi. The pole order can be reduced by suitable brane factors. For the integral to be a power
series in φ, we must have first order poles. Assuming this is the case, we can deduce the following
expression for the fundamental period of the mirror:
ϖ(LV )

12This will not be as easy for GLSMs whose gauge groups have positive roots as the integrand of the hemisphere
partition function will have a more complicated structure.
