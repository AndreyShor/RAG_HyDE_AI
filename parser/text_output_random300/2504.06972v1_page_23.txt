Extended Data Fig. 2 | Device geometry, contact resistance, twist angle calibration and 
sample inhomogeneity. a, Optical microscope image of the 3.83° tMoTe2 device. The scale 
bar is 10 μm. b, Schematic of the Hall bar geometry and a typical measurement configuration. 
Functional contacts are labeled by numbers in a and b, where contacts 20 and 21 are shorted. 
c, Two-terminal resistance Rtwo-terminal as a function of νh at D = -165 mV/nm and TMC = 15 mK, 
measured with different configurations. Features of correlated insulators measured with 
different configurations align well, demonstrating the high uniformity of the device. The 
variation in νh across the entire Hall bar is within 0.03. d, Rtwo-terminal as a function of νh at D = 0 
and TMC = 15 mK, measured with contacts 5 and 7. The contact resistance is estimated about 
half of the Rtwo-terminal, which is about 50 kΩ for νh > 0.55. e, Symmetrized ρxx as a function of 
νh and B measured with voltage probe 7 and 8 (shown in b), at D = -5 mV/nm and T = 300 mK. 
A set of Landau fan emanates from νh = 1 are highlighted by dashed lines, and the Landau level 
filling factors νLL from 1 to 4 are labeled correspondingly. The onset of SdH oscillations occurs 
around 3 T, and they are single-fold degenerate. f, At several fixed B, we calculate the carrier 
density based on SdH oscillations using nSdH = νLLeB/h, and plot them as a function of νh. From 
the slope of the linear fit, we obtain a moiré density nM = (4.19 ± 0.03) ×1012 cm−2. Similarly, 
using the data measured with voltage probe 5 and 7, we get nM = (4.13 ± 0.03) ×1012 cm−2. 
Considering nM values from both measurement configurations, the twist angle is determined to 
be 3.83°±0.03°.
