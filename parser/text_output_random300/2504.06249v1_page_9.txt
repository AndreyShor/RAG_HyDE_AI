Figure 8: Density of states (DOS) for generated materials with the first atom conditioned on the DOS of Ir
from IrO2. The blue curve represents the ground truth target DOS. The orange curve represents the DOS
of the first atom in each generated material, predicted using the forward GNN model. The green curve
represents the DOS of the first atom computed via DFT. The first atomâ€™s element type is highlighted in red
in the composition.
alignment with target properties. The model demonstrates remarkable versatility across constrained gener-
ation tasks, including masked generation, initialization from template materials, and atom-type constraints,
enabling precise and fine-grained control over the generated structures. Additionally, through a large-scale
screening approach, DOSMatGen effectively identifies stable candidate materials with complex electronic
properties such as those of IrO2. The ability to balance structural validity, property alignment, and com-
positional diversity positions DOSMatGen as a valuable tool for a wide range of materials discovery tasks,
guided by the physically important objective of the electronic structure. Finally, it is worth noting that
DOSMatGen is property-agnostic and can be readily adapted to other electronic and even spectroscopic
properties, including 1D X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra, angle-resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES),
X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) among others, as well as 2D images such as scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) images.
