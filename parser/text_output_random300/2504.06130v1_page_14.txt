absence of the B1
2g peak in the Raman spectrum. All these characteristics are present in
the exfoliated sample (see Fig. 2b,c), which confirms its monolayer nature. A home-built
micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy system was used for the PL characterization.
In
the setup, a 532 nm CW-laser was coupled into a commercial optical microscope (WiTec
alpha300 S). The photoluminescence (PL) signal was collected in reflection geometry and
guided to a grating spectrometer (QE-65000-FL, Ocean Optics) and evaluated with the
internal detector. For the Raman spectroscopy, we used a commercial system (inVia Reflex,
Renishaw) equipped with a 532 nm CW-laser.

AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS STATEMENT
S.K., D.N., and G.S. conceived the experiments. S.K. and L.V.M. performed the non-
linear optical experiments and analyzed the data. S.K. prepared the monolayer sample by
mechanical exfoliation. T.L. and U.P. performed the numerical simulations. J.W. devel-
oped the theoretical analytical model based on SBEs. S.K., J.W., U.P., D.N., and G.S.
interpreted the experimental and theoretical results. S.K., T.L., J.W., and G.S. wrote the
manuscript, with contributions from all authors. All authors participated in the discussion
and commented on the manuscript.
