Profiles of the mass density of newly-
formed stars (top) and the spatially cumulative mass
of newly-formed stars from small to large radii (bottom)
in the fiducial (blue), noSNfb (orange), and noAGNfb
(green) simulations at ùë°= 1000 Myr. All three simula-
tions exhibit centrally concentrated star formation, with
total new stellar mass significantly below the galaxy‚Äôs
initial stellar content, indicating maintenance of qui-
escence. The fiducial simulation demonstrates the
highest star formation efficiency among the three mod-
els.
tion.
This apparent ‚Äúpositive SN feedback‚Äù ef-
fect on BH growth through turbulence generation
warrants further investigation in a dedicated study.
However, it is important to note that this positive
effect of SN feedback is observed when operating
synergistically with AGN feedback, and it remains
unclear whether SN feedback would maintain this
positive influence on BH growth in the absence of
AGN feedback, though the latter scenario seems
unlikely.
3.7. Star formation
Fig. 8 presents the radial distribution of newly-
formed stellar mass density (top) and the cumu-
lative mass of new stars as a function of radius
(bottom) for our three simulation models.
The
stellar mass density profiles exhibit peak values
at ùëü‚àº1 kpc, with comparable magnitudes in the
fiducial and noAGNfb simulations that exceed
the noSNfb peak by approximately two orders of
magnitude. Both fiducial and noAGNfb models
demonstrate steeper central density gradients com-
pared to noSNfb, indicating more spatially con-
centrated star formation. Notably, star formation
activity is confined to regions within ùëü‚àº5 kpc
across all simulations.
The cumulative mass distributions reveal steeper
growth with radius in the fiducial and noAGNfb
simulations relative to noSNfb, consistent with
their mass density profiles. The total mass of newly-
formed stars reaches 4.9 √ó 107 M‚äô, 3.6 √ó 107 M‚äô,
and 1.3 √ó 107 M‚äôin the fiducial, noAGNfb, and
noSNfb simulations respectively ‚Äì all negligible
fractions of the galaxy‚Äôs initial stellar mass. Re-
markably, although still maintaining galaxy qui-
escence, the fiducial simulation incorporating
both feedback mechanisms exhibits the highest star
formation efficiency. While this might suggest pos-
itive feedback effects, as discussed for SN feedback
in ¬ß3.6, it cannot be concluded that AGN feedback‚Äôs
impact on star formation is also positive: in the
noAGNfb simulation, the presence of an accreting
central SMBH effectively deplete the gas reservoir
potentially available for star formation (see ¬ß3.4),
thus leading to smaller total new stellar mass com-
pared to the fiducial simulation. This does not
imply the AGN feedback itself promotes star for-
mation, but rather that the presence of an accreting
BH without feedback can suppress star formation
by depleting the gas reservoir more rapidly.
