Introduction
Quantum mechanics governs the behavior of matter and energy at atomic scales. Its modern
textbook formulation (e.g. Griﬃths and Schroeter 2018) rests on three foundational postu-
lates:
(1) The Schr¨odinger equation governs the time evolution of the quantum state in the
absence of measurement (Schr¨odinger 1926a,b).
(2) Wave function collapse postulates the sudden reduction of the state vector during
measurement, occurring when a quantum system interacts with the external world in
an experiment (e.g. von Neumann 1932).
(3) The Born rule determines the probability of obtaining a given measurement outcome
(Born 1926). This probability is proportional to the squared norm of the state vector
after wave function collapse.
Despite its predictive success, quantum mechanics remains conceptually problematic. The
issue is not its counterintuitive implications, but rather that a fundamental physical theory
should not require three separate and partially incompatible laws of time evolution.
Physical theories traditionally follow a simple framework: initial conditions plus laws of
motion. Classical mechanics, electrodynamics, and general relativity all share this structure.
The multiple postulates of quantum mechanics deviate from this framework. In particular,
the wave function collapse postulate directly contradicts the Schr¨odinger equation.
This
“measurement problem” does not aﬀect the ability of the theory to make coherent and
successful predictions, but it exposes a fundamental inconsistency when our goal is a coherent
description of nature.
Fortunately, Everett’s Many-Worlds Interpretation (Everett 1957), combined with quan-
tum decoherence theory (e.g. Zeh 1970, Zurek 1981), oﬀers a logically consistent solution.
This solution relies on two key principles:
(a) One law of motion: The Many-Worlds Interpretation eliminates wave function col-
lapse as a fundamental postulate. Only the Schr¨odinger equation governs quantum
