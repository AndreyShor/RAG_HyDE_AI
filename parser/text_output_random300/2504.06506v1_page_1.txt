SOME REMARKS ON THE PRODUCT FORMULA FOR
DEFECT NUMBERS OF CLOSED OPERATORS
CHRISTOPH FISCHBACHER, FRITZ GESZTESY, AND LANCE L. LITTLEJOHN
Dedicated with great aﬀection and admiration to Henk de Snoo
on the happy occasion of his 80th birthday
Abstract. This largely pedagogical note recalls some facts on defect numbers
of products of closed operators employing results from the theory of semi-
Fredholm operators and then applies these facts to positive integer powers of
symmetric operators and subsequently to certain minimal Sturm–Liouville and
minimal higher even-order ordinary diﬀerential operators. We also point out
some unexpected missed opportunities when comparing the work of diﬀerent
groups on this subject.

1. Introduction
A very happy birthday, Henk! We hope this note will cause some smiles on your
part.
This primarily pedagogical note originated with the following explicit question:
“What are the deﬁciency indices of positive integer powers of of the minimal Le-
gendre operator in L2((−1, 1))?” It did not take long to realize that this question,
actually, a much more general one, had long been answered by at least three diﬀer-
ent groups.
In 1950 (Engl. translation in 1953) I. M. Glazman [40] determined the deﬁciency
indices of products of densely deﬁned and closed linear operators T1 and T2 in a
complex separable Hilbert space assuming ﬁnite defect numbers of T1, T2, that is,
def(Tj, 0) = dim(ker(T ∗
j )) < ∞,
j = 1, 2,
