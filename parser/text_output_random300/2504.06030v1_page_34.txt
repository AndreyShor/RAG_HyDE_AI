This is not very transparent and we have given a different version in terms of elliptic
integrals of Ref. [27]. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness we include an implicit

Needless to say this result is important in guaranteeing the convergence in the long
time limit of semi-classical orbits to classical periodic ones generalising our results for
Keplerian ellipses and astronomical elliptic states. We reiterate the width of the collision

In generalising this result to 3-dimensions the reader must remember ∇R must be in the
osculating plane of the classical orbit C0 and must be parallel to its normal, n, to satisfy
the semi-classical equations. Needless to say fixing |∇R|2 in our neighbourhood of C0
in a sense is a weak violation of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Our astronomical
