captures the complexity of the wake while effectively eliminating additional noise, offering
a more accurate representation of the flow dynamics.
Figure 24 and Figure 25 present the predicted streamwise and normal velocity com-
ponents for HOSVD and SVD across the three LSTM architectures. For the streamwise
velocity, HOSVD performs well, effectively capturing the primary flow structures across all
architectures. The SVD-based LSTM models, for certain snapshots, provide an averaged
flow scenario just like the cylinder 2D case, except for the time-distributed architecture.
However, the predicted normal velocity snapshots align very closely with the cleaned
ground truth across the architectures based on the two decomposition techniques.
For the streamwise velocity component (Table 14), HOSVD achieves lower RRMSE
values across all LSTM architectures compared to SVD. The LSTM 2 Dense architecture
