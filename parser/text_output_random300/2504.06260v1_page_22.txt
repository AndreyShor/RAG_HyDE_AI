was the result of genuinely solving the model, computing a solution and exporting
it. Return ‘N/A‘ for both fields if the table suffers from either of the failure modes
described above.

REPLY:
We then compute the number of problems for which the LM was able to parse the reply and
convert it to a JSON. This fraction is the number we report as Valid Target.
C.5
Relative Error | Strict
Our strict filter for whether a model has truly solved the problem is to take the subset
of problems for which the problem was judged to be a valid export by the LLM, and to
consider the algorithmically parsed last value. We then compute the relative error of this
value against the ground truth target value. If this value is less than 10%, we consider it
valid.
C.6
Physics Metrics
The interface lines are parsed from the ground truth code by finding lines that fit the
regex pattern for interface creation. Likewise for the feature creation and feature property
modification lines. Each of these lines of codes can be considered as an “Action” consisting
of an Action Type (eg: Create Interface) with corresponding Arguments (eg: Interface tag,
Name of the Interface, Geometry).
Create
Interface:
model.component("comp1").physics().create("Interface tag",
"InterfaceName", "Geometry tag");
Eg: model.component("comp1").physics().create("ht", "HeatTransfer", "geom1");
Create Feature:
model.component("comp1").physics("Interface tag").create("
Feature tag", "FeatureName", Dimension);
Eg:
model.component("comp1").physics("ht").create("temp1",
"TemperatureBoundary", 1);
Modify Feature Property: model.component("comp1").physics("Interface tag")
.feature("Feature tag").set("Param", "Value");
Eg:
model.component("comp1").physics("ht").feature("temp1").set("T0",
"1000[degC]");

Interface Factuality
We
check
whether
the
Interface
name
exists
in
a
list
of
known
COMSOL
Multiphysics®interfaces. If it exists in this list, we assign it a factuality of 1, else 0.
