Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the isometric property of ˜U(τ, 0),

|(ϕ0, ϕt)L2′ −(ϕ0, ϕ0)L2′| →0,
as ℏ→0.
Using the isometric property of ˜U(0, t), we obtain
||ϕt −ϕ0||2
L2′ = 2(ϕ0, ϕ0)L2′ −(ϕ0, ϕt)L2′ −(ϕt, ϕ0)L2′ ≤2|(ϕ0, ϕt)L2′ −(ϕ0, ϕ0)L2′| →0,
as ℏ→0. Finally, changing integration variables once more, we arrive at
|| exp[−iS(x, t)/ℏ]ψℏ(x, t) −J1/2

(x)ϕ0[x0(x, t)]||L2 →0,
as ℏ→0.
This proves the theorem.
This theorem is tantamount to
”quantum mechanics →classical mechanics as ℏ→0”
There is a corresponding result for the Schr¨odinger heat equation embodying some
quantum features including a very useful Feynman-Kac formuula - the elementary
formula of Elworthy and Truman, Ref. [11], giving our solution of the Schr¨odinger heat
equation as a sum over paths where the paths are the sample paths of the Nelson diffusion
process for the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation. This leads to our Burgers-Zeldovich
model in astronomy incorporating Newtonian quantum gravity’s main characteristic
spirals. (See Ref. [22]).
