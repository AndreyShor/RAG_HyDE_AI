specific point in the complex plane, or line gaps, where the energy eigenvalues do not cross a specific line in the complex plane.
nonhermitian spectra with line gaps can always be adiabatically deformed to hermitian and gapped spectra. The nonhermitian
complex energy spectra of Eq. (4) shows a line gap, which is the line in the complex plane with Im(E(k)) = 0, and can be
deformed to hermitian real energy spectra with an energy gap by taking the limits Im(v) →0, Im(m) →0, as shown in Fig. 1.
The line gap closes when E(k) = 0 for some momenta k ∈R. Hence, the closing of the line gap is determined if the condition
E(k) = 0 is satisfied for any k ∈R, i.e., if any of the solutions of the algebraic equation (k2 + m)2 + 4v2k2 = 0, which are
given by k = ±

= 0. Hence, the line
gap of the complex energy spectra closes when the quantity
M = |Re(

v2 + m)| −|Re(v)|,

becomes zero. The closing of the line gap separates topologically nonequivalent phases with M > 0 and M < 0. In the hermitian
limit, one has that M = 0 if and only if m = 0, and therefore, the condition above simply reduces to the condition m = 0. To
determine the topological invariant W of the gapped spectra, we recall that in the hermitian case, the topologically trivial phase
with W = 0 corresponds to m > 0, and the topologically nontrivial phases with W ̸= 0 correspond to m < 0 with W = sgn(v).
Since the nonhermitian topological invariant must coincide with the hermitian topological invariant in the limit Im(v) →0,
Im(m) →0, one can conclude that
W =

sgn(Re(v)),

Exact solutions of zero modes at smooth domain walls
We assume that the fields become constant at large distances x →±∞and that they approach their asymptotic values
exponentially as |m(x →∓∞) −mL,R| ∼e−|x|/w, |v(x →∓∞) −vL,R| ∼e−|x|/w. Here, the constant w > 0 is a
characteristic length that measures the width of the smooth domain wall localized at the origin x = 0. Under these very
general assumptions, by mapping the whole real line −∞< x < ∞into the finite segment 0 < y < 1 with the substitution
y(x) = (1 + tanh (x/2w))/2, we found that for a given pseudospin s = ±1, the general solution of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi
equation is given by a linear combination A1φs

Let us assume now that the fields v(x) and m(x) can be expanded in powers of y(x) up to the first and second order, respectively,
i.e., as v(x) = v0 +v1y(x), and m(x) = m0 +m1y(x)+m2y(x)2, where the coefficients of the expansion are given by v0 = vL,
v1 = vR −vL, and m0 = mL, m1 + m2 = mR −mL, m2 = 2(mL + mR) −4m(0). In this case, we found that the
general solution of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions. Indeed, for a given
pseudospin s = ±1, we found that
