Figure 11.
ASHiTA with three iterations for the high-level task of "Inspect the cleanliness of the utility area". (b) From the initial hierarchy, all items
except for the bins are grounded in the generated scene graph. Many suggestions are generated to update the hierarchy. (c) Suggested items "laundry" and
"washing machine" are used to generate new subtasks, these are also successfully grounded in the generated scene graph. Grounding these items trigger a
few additional suggestions. (d) Suggested items "laundry machine" added to the task hierarchy. This refers to the dryer next to the washing machine. Our
estimated final task hierarchy recalls all of the grounded items in the reference task hierarchy except for the bucket next to the washing machine.
