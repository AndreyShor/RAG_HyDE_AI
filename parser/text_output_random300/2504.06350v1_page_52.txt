space (Figure 14). Maximizing qL involves identifying two additional points that are collinear with this
point: pL
AB(a, b|x, y), located within the local set L, and pNL, which lies outside the local set but within
the quantum set Q. The goal is to minimize the ratio of the distances from pL
AB(a, b|x, y) to pAB(a, b|x, y)
and from pNL
AB(a, b|x, y) to pAB(a, b|x, y).
The assertion that Eve has perfect knowledge of all outcomes when distributing a local correlation to Alice
and Bob is based on the fact that the local set L forms a convex polytope within the probability space. As
such, any local correlation pL
AB(a, b|x, y) can be expressed as a combination of the extremal points of the
polytope, which can be represented by the vector pL = (pL
i (a, b|x, y))i. Furthermore, in this geometric
construction, maximizing the local weight qL results in the optimal local correlation pL
AB(a, b|x, y) lying
on the boundary of the local polytope L, meaning it must always reside on one of the polytope’s facets.
Analogous to pL, one can define the vector qL = (qL
i (a, b|x, y))i, which represents the probabilities as-
signed by Eve to each local correlation in the CC attack. Similarly, the average non-local correlation
that Eve distributes can be modeled as a mixture of preselected non-local quantum correlations, forming
the vector pNL = (pNL
i
(a, b|x, y))i, with the corresponding probability vector qNL = (qNL
i
(a, b|x, y))i
indicating the probabilities assigned by Eve to each non-local correlation.
To optimize the CC attack, Eve seeks a probability vector q = qL ⊕qNL, ensuring that local correla-
tions are distributed as frequently as possible. This requires solving the following linear program, which
maximizes the overall probability of sending any local boxes:
qCC[pNL, p(a, b|x, y)] = arg max

subject to the following constraints:

The first condition is nothing but eq. (147) and the other constraints ensure q is a valid probability vector.
The set of extremal local correlation, pL, is a predetermined fixed collection fixed by the scenario.
To apply the CC attack and upper bound the key rate in a DI-QKD protocol, one must first specify the
ideal correlation that would be shared by the parties in the absence of noise, denoted by QAB(a, b|x, y).
However, due to practical imperfections—such as finite detection efficiency η and visibility v—the actual
noisy correlation observed is pAB(a, b|x, y). This correlation is then decomposed within the attack into
local and nonlocal parts as equation (147).
The method in [296] works such that the eavesdropper must specify in advance the set of nonlocal
correlations pNL to be used in the convex decomposition and then apply the linear program (4.5) to
determine the local contribution. For a CHSH protocol involving maximally entangled states with finite
detection efficiency η, the maximum local weight can be analytically determined as
qL = (1 −η)(1 + (3 + 2
√
2)η)
for
η ≥ηloc,
where ηloc = 2(
√
2−1) ≈82.8% is the detection efficiency threshold, below which (η < ηloc) the correlation
p(a, b|x, y) becomes local.
As a result, the following bounds can be derived for the one-way and two-way protocols:
r1-way ≤(3 + 2

There are critical values for one-way (η1-crit ≈89.18%) and two-way (η2-crit ≈85.36%) protocols, below
which the key rates become negative. This demonstrates that, for detection efficiencies in the range
ηloc ≤η ≤ηi-crit, no DI-QKD protocol is feasible, even though the shared correlation remains nonlocal.
The same result can be extended to the case of finite visibility (v < 1); i.e., there are critical visibilities
that introduce nonlocal intervals in which no DI-QKD protocol is possible.
Zhang et al. [297] applied the CC attack to a two-way protocol by optimizing the non-local points in
the CC decomposition using the NPA-hierarchy [127]. They demonstrated that noise reduction can be
achieved by employing the B-step procedure [224].
