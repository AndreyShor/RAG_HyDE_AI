Corollary 4.14. Let X be a DHR bimodule. As a B0-bimodule, X decomposes as L
i X−
i ⊗X+
i ,
where X±
i are irreducible A±-bimodules that appear as submodules of Y± for some DHR bimodule
Y .
Proof. Let D = C−⊠C+. The claim for X = A follows from the above proposition by the
semisimplicity of D. Suppose that A ≃L
i Z−
i ⊗Z+
i is such a decomposition. Given a general
DHR bimodule X, we have a surjective B0-homomorphism X−⊠A−A →X given by the product
map ξ ⊗a 7→ξa. This gives a surjective map L
i(X−⊠A−Z−
i ) ⊗Z+
i →X. Let us ﬁx i. If Z−
i
appears as an A−-submodule of Y−for some DHR bimodule Y , then X−⊠A−Z−
i appears as a
submodule of (X ⊠A Y )−. This shows the claimed decomposition of X.

4.3. Finiteness of the DHR category. Let us put D = C−⊠C+. We assume that Condi-
tion 2.5 holds, so that D has a simple unit.
Let us denote by A the C∗-algebra object in D associated to the inclusion B0 ⊂A (see [JP19,
HPN23]). The ﬁnite index condition on E allows us to write
A(X) = HomB0-B0(X, A) ≃HomB0-A(X ⊗
B0
A, A).
Using the rightmost model for A, the algebra structure can be deﬁned as
A(X) ⊗A(Y ) ∋f ⊙g 7→f ◦(idX ⊗g) ∈A(X ⊗
B0
Y ).
The involution jA
X : A(X) →A(X) is given as the composite
HomB0-A(X ⊗
B0
A, A) →HomB0-A(A, X ⊗
B0
A)
∗→HomB0-A(X ⊗
B0
A, A),
where the ﬁrst map is the Frobenius reciprocity map f 7→(idX ⊗f)(RX ⊗idA).
Remark 4.15. Without the ﬁnite index condition, HomB0-B0(X, A) would not give the right
object.
Corollary 4.14 says that, under Condition 4.10, the map
|A|alg =
M
X∈Irr(D)
X ⊙A(X) →A
given by evaluation is an injective homomorphism with dense image. The summand correspond-
ing to the monoidal unit 1D ∈Irr(D) is B0 ⊗(B′
0 ∩A), since A(B0) is the space of B0-central
elements in A. Thus, the orthogonal projection onto this summand deﬁnes a faithful conditional
expectation
E: A →B0 ⊗(B′
0 ∩A).
To estimate the “index” of E, we freely use notation from [KPW04]. In particular, given C∗-
algebras C, D, and a bi-Hilbertian C∗-C-D-module CXD, we consider its right index element
r-Ind(X) ∈C′′ and right numerical index r-I(X) ∈[0, ∞].
The element r-Ind(X) can be
formally considered as F(idX) for the completely positive map F extending K(XD) →C given
by ξη∗7→C(ξ, η), hence we have the additivity r-Ind(X ⊕X′) = r-Ind(X) + r-Ind(X′). The
number r-I(X) can be deﬁned as ∥r-Ind(X)∥[KPW04, discussion after Deﬁnition 2.17].
Lemma 4.16. For X ∈D, we have r-Ind(X) = d(X).
Proof. The existence of ﬁnite right basis for X, combined with B0 being unital, implies that
r-Ind(X) is an element of B0 by [KPW04, Corollary 2.25]. The bimodule X is of ﬁnite right
numerical index, that is, r-I(X) < ∞holds. This, combined with the simplicity of B0, implies
that r-Ind(X) is a scalar by [KPW04, Corollary 2.26]. Moreover, solutions to the conjugate
equations for X are related to r-Ind(X) by R
∗R = r-Ind(X), see [KPW04, Theorem 4.4]. (We
also have R∗R = l-Ind(X).) We then get the claim by normalization condition d(X) = R
∗R.
