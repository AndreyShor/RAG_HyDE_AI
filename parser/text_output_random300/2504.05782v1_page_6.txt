complexity and avoiding serious data contamination.
4.2. Evaluation Procedures
Our evaluation process assesses model responses through
multiple steps, as illustrated in Fig. 3. 1) We input either the
original or dynamically augmented question into the model.
The model then generates a response based on textual and
visual information. 2) The output is parsed using GPT as
an interpreter to extract the final predicted answer from the
modelâ€™s response. 3) We compare the extracted answer
with the ground truth. If they match exactly, the model
receives full credit (a score of 1.0 for that question). If the
answer does not match perfectly, we conduct a more fine-
grained check with GPT and pre-defined scoring rules. If a
question has multiple sub-questions or answers, we count
how many elements are correct. For instance, if a fill-in-the-
blank question has two blanks and the model only fills one
correctly, we assign a score of 0.5.
