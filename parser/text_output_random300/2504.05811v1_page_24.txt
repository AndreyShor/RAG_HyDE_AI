the hadronic molecules with hidden strangeness), and ∆∗; t-channel; u-channel; and the general-
ized contact term. Through some simplification settings in Sec. III B, there are a total of 77 free
parameters in the model listed in Table II and Table III, which represents a relatively streamlined
number of fit parameters. We then construct χ2
weight through our theoretical model, incorporating
nearly all available experimental data and associated weights listed in Table I. The fitted values of
the free parameters are determined by minimizing the χ2
weight with MINUIT.
The theoretical results corresponding to the final fitted parameter values listed in Table II and
Table III are in good agreement with all the available experimental data of both cross-sections and
polarization observables for γp →K+Σ0 and γp →K0Σ+ reactions, which is directly reflected in
the very low χ2/Ndata values listed in Table IV. Achieving this is challenging for coupled-channel
fits that involve two different reactions and data sets from various measurements, demonstrating
the effectiveness of our theoretical model.
In the results of cross-sections, contributions from the s-channel ∆∗resonance exchanges are
more substantial for the reaction γp →K+Σ0. In contrast, for the reaction γp →K0Σ+, the con-
