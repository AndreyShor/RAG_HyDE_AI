increases due to intensified plasma interaction with higher photon energy, leading to accelerated 
energy loss. Quantum plasma, characterized by greater wave dispersion by 53% compared to the 
absence of quantum effects, attributes this phenomenon to the presence of Fermi pressure. 
Additionally, spin-polarization amplifies power transmission of waves, notably increasing the 
propagation vector by 83% in fully polarized plasma scenarios. Integration of quantum 
correction terms, such as Fermi pressure, quantum Bohm potential, and fermion spin effects, 
elevates electrostatic potential within soliton profiles in quantum plasma compared to non 
quantum plasma counterparts. These corrections induce energy redistribution and heightened 
electron occupancy in higher energy states, fortifying soliton stability and dynamics by 60%. 
Further, variations in ion particle density influence the electrostatic potential of soliton profiles, 
with increasing density correlating with decreased electrostatic potential by approx. 50%, driven 
by charge redistribution influenced by Fermi pressure and quantum effects. 
The present study will be helpful in analysing the behaviour of electron-positron plasmas 
in extreme environments such as quasars, gamma-ray bursts, active galactic cores, pulsar 
magnetospheres, black hole accretion discs, white dwarf atmospheres, Van Allen radiation belts, 
also exist in the early universe, as well as the centre of our galaxy. This comprehensive 
framework not only offers insight into fundamental physical processes, but also facilitates the 
interpretation of observational data from astrophysical sources, thus advancing our 
understanding of the universe's most energetic and enigmatic phenomena.
