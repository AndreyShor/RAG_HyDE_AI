information gain and disturbance, tied to quantum uncertainty [198, 199] and wave-particle duality
[200, 201]. Variants like generalized contextuality [48], hyperbits [202], Kirkwood-Dirac distribution [203],
witwords [183], and overall Generalized Probabilistic Theories [204, 205] highlight quantum advantages
for DI cryptography.
3. Fully Device Independent Quantum Key Distribution (DI-QKD)
Device-dependent cryptography permits inventa fraus [13]; facta lexia, DI-QKD eliminates them via
BI violation. In this section, we are going to introduce the DI protocols that enhance security.
Definition 11 (Indistinguishable protocols). Let Π and Π′ protocols which take inputs and produce
outputs in the presence of an external environment. We define an equivalence relation Π ∼ϵ(n) Π′ if for
any probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) environment Z, there exists a negligible function ϵ(n) (in the
security parameter n) such that
AdvZ(Π, Π′) ≤ϵ(n),
AdvZ(Π, Π′) :=
Pr

Z(Π) = 1

−Pr

Z(Π′) = 1
.
(32)
where Adv is the distinguishing advantage function.
In other words, no efficient environment can tell Π apart from Π′ with more than the negligible
advantage ϵ(n).
Definition 12 (Simulation Security). We denote a real protocol executed among parties which may be
corrupted by a real adversary ER as a function ΠR(ER) and an ideal protocol ΠI that receives inputs from
the parties and returns outputs that are guaranteed to satisfy the security properties in the presence of a
simulated adversary (simulator) ES also as a function ΠI(ES). The protocol ΠR(ER) is said to securely
realize the ideal functionality ΠI if for every PPT adversary ER there exists a PPT simulator ES such
that ΠI(ES) ∼ϵ(n) ΠR(ER).
This definition captures the intuition that any attack on ΠR in the real world can be simulated in the
ideal world, so that no environment can distinguish the two executions except with negligible probability.
In practice, protocols are rarely executed in isolation.
The UC framework requires that security be
preserved even when the protocol is composed with an arbitrary set of other protocols.
Definition 13 (Universal Composable (UC) Security). A protocol ΠR UC-realizes an ideal functionality
ΠI if for every PPT adversary A even in the presence of arbitrary concurrent protocol executions {Πi}i)
there exists a PPT simulator ES such that for every PPT environment Z, (ΠR, {Π}i) ∼ϵ(n) (ΠR, {Π}i),
that is
Pr

Z(ΠR, {Π}i) = 1

−Pr

Z(ΠI, {Π}i) = 1
 ≤ϵ(n).
(33)
Here, the environment Z is allowed arbitrary interactions with all components (including Π as a
subroutine, and any other concurrently running protocols {Πi}i), and the security guarantee must hold
regardless of the surrounding context and any efficient environment.
3.1. Bell inequalities bound eavesdropper’s knowledge
Suppose that the behaviour observed by Alice and Bob p = pAB|XY to compute the Bell functional
(e.g. (12)) is a marginal of a global non-signalling distribution pABE|XY Z where Eve is correlated with
Alice and Bob. This distribution is a priori unknown and may have been chosen by the adversary. In
other words, all our security claims are supposed to hold for any possible initial non-signaling distribution
pABE|XY Z. If Bob measure Y = y = 0 and obtains B = b, then we can quantify the knowledge that Eve
has about b by optimal guessing probability
pg(b|E) = max

pBE|Y Z(b, e, y = 0, z),
if pg(b|E) =

Eve knows with certainty b

Eve is completely ignorant about b.
(34)
We will show that Eve’s knowledge is bounded by a functional f acting on the Bell value Pg(b|E) <
f[βQ(p)], but first we observe that Eve’s knowledge about b is in terms of the statistics of A, B, X, T re-
gardless of how the correlations p = pAB|XY are generated. In particular, the privacy of B is independent
of the functioning of the device used to generate it. Even if the devices are maliciously designed by Eve,
and even if the devices violate quantum theory, the security of the protocol is not compromised. The only
