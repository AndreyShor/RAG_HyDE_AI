5.3 MFR-OCE on ex vivo porcine cornea 
Figure 10(a) presents the 3D B-mode scan of one of the ex vivo porcine cornea samples with a 
pie cut to reveal its interior. By applying bandpass frequency filters with a bandwidth of 10 Hz, 
the wave fields for each excitation frequency were estimated. Figures 10(b) through 10(f) show 
the 3D reverberant shear wave fields at frequencies of 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz, 2000 Hz, 
and 2500 Hz, respectively. Generally, the wavelength decreases as the frequency increases.

Figure 11 presents 3D SWS maps estimated using MFR-OCE on an ex vivo porcine cornea 
sample across different excitation frequencies ranging from 500 Hz to 2500 Hz. The results 
demonstrate a clear frequency-dependent increase in SWS, as indicated by the progressive color 
shift from blue (low SWS) to yellow/red (high SWS) at higher frequencies. This trend suggests 
that the cornea exhibits dispersion behavior, where shear wave speed increases with frequency, 
reflecting its biomechanical properties. The SWS distribution appears relatively uniform in the 
central region of the cornea, with slightly lower values near the periphery, potentially due to 
variations in tissue structure or boundary effects. At higher frequencies (2000 Hz and 2500 Hz),
