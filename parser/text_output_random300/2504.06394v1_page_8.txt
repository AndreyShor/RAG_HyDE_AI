The non-dimensionalization procedure introduces several dimensionless parameters. We
shall see that the most important of these are the stiffness
𝜅=
𝐵T
𝑎2𝑅𝜇,
(2.14)
which measures the time scale of forcing to the time scale of the cupula’s relaxation, and the
Stokes number
St = 𝑎2
𝜈T ,
(2.15)
which measures the time scale of vorticity diffusion across the channel width, 𝑎2/𝜈, to the
time scale of motion, T. (Note that this version of the Stokes number arises in Stokes’
second problem and is sometimes replaced by the Womersley number, Wm = St1/2.) We
also introduce the Reynolds number of the flow, Re = 𝜌U𝑅/𝜇, as well as the cupula’s
inertia, 𝜚= 𝜌𝑠𝑎2𝑡ℎ𝜈/(𝐵T) and inverse bendability 𝑏= 𝐵/(𝑇𝑎2) (Davidovitch et al. 2011).
To understand the relative size (and hence importance) of these parameters, we now discuss
characteristic parameter values and typical sizes of dimensionless parameters next.
2.4.2. Parameter values
First, we consider the geometrical parameters, taken from Daocai et al. (2014): 𝑅≈3.2×10−3
m, and 𝑎≈1.6 × 10−4 m, so that the aspect ratio is 𝜖∼0.05. The cupula’s thickness is
usually quoted as 𝑡ℎ≈400 𝜇m.
The endolymph composition is very close to water, suggesting that the dynamical
parameters are similar to water: 𝜌= 1000 Kg·m−3, and the viscosity is 𝜇≈10−3 Kg·m−1·s−1.
