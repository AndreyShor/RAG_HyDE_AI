logarithm of the likelihood with a penalty term 52,53:
AIC = −2ln(L(d|θ)) + 2θ.
(3)
where L(d|θ) is the likelihood of the model, θ is the number of free parameters of a particular
model. The model with the smallest AIC is favored. ∆AIC = AICBand −AICBand+Gaussian
provides a numerical assessment of the evidence that model Band+Gaussian is to be preferred over
model Band. When ∆AIC > 10, it strongly favors the model Band+Gassian. As shown in Table 2,
our results reveal that during the time interval 8 −30 s, the ∆AIC value reaches its maximum at
51.87, strongly favoring the Gaussian+Band model over the simpler Band model. In the four finer
time-resolved spectra (8 −21 s (C.1), 11 −24 s (C.2), 14 −27 s (C.3), 17 −30 s (C.4)), the
∆AIC values vary between 25.76 and 36.55, further strongly favoring the addition of the Gaussian
component.
When evaluating the significance of emission or absorption features in spectrum analysis, the
Bayesian factor is also a commonly used tool20,54,55. The Bayesian factor is utilized to compare
the relative support for different models, serving as a measure to evaluate the strength of evidence
in favor of one model over another. Bayesian evidence (Z) is calculated for model selection and
can be formulated as follows:
Z =
Z
L(d|θ)π(θ)dθ,
(4)
where π(θ) represents the prior distribution for θ. The ratio of the Bayesian evidence for two
different models is called the Bayes factor (BF). In this paper, the BF is formulated as follows:
BF = ZBand+Gaussian
ZBand
,
(5)
The corresponding logarithmic expression is as follows:
ln(BF) = ln(ZBand+Gaussian) −ln(ZBand).
(6)
If ln(BF) > 8, it indicates strong evidence in favor of the Band+Gaussian model56,57. We calcu-
lated the Bayes factors for time intervals with narrow emission features (as shown in Table 2), and
the results shown that the Band+Gaussian model was preferred in finer time intervals (8 −21 s,
11 −24 s, 14 −27 s, 17 −30 s) with ln(BF) betweem 2.06 −7.34. Remarkably, during the entire
time interval of 8 −30 s, the ln(BF) = 9.99 providing strong statistical support for the addition of
the Gaussian component, suggesting the presence of the narrow emission feature.
We also employed the alternative analysis software GTBURST to extract the corresponding
spectra from the time intervals exhibiting a narrow emission feature. The extracted spectra were
fitted using the XSPEC 12.11.1 58, and the fitting results similarly indicate the presence of distinct
