Binary Games
In this section, we consider non-local games where answers are bits.
Deﬁnition 12. A binary game G = (X ×Y, A×B, π, V ) is a non-local game
where A = B = {0, 1}.
This next result states that quantum strategies cannot have an advantage
over classical strategies if there exists a quantum strategy that always win
the game.
Theorem 8. Let G be a binary game. If there exists a quantum strategy for
G that wins with probability 1, then ωC(G) = 1.
This result is fairly strong, it implies that we will never be able to perfectly
achieve such tasks when it is not possible classically.

XOR-games
In this section, we study games for which the result depends not on the
individual answers, but on the exclusive-OR of respective answers.
This
category of games include the bipartite communication complexity tasks of
section 3.
Deﬁnition 13. A XOR-game G = (X × Y, A × B, π, V ) is a binary game
where V : C × X × Y →{0, 1} and C = {a ⊕b|a ∈A, b ∈B}.
The following deﬁnition will be of use for some of the results of this
section. It is the winning probability when players are restricted to a trivial
strategy, a trivial strategy consisting of outputting random bits.
Deﬁnition 14. The success probability for a game G if both parties are
restricted to a trivial strategy (output random bits) is
τ(G) = 1

When playing a XOR-game, the gain of the best quantum strategy over
the trivial strategy cannot be too great compared to the gain of the best
classical strategy over the trivial strategy.
This is the essence of the fol-
lowing result, which upper bounds the gap between quantum and classical
advantages over the trivial strategy.
