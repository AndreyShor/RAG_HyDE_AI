setup’) and one with two pulses linearly polarised in the
same direction (the ‘LP-setup’). The polarisation degree
of the Compton photon beam can be finely controlled
by applying an angular cut with a finite acceptance ∆θ
downstream of the electron beam in stage I) [96]. This
finite angular acceptance ∆θ ∝wl/d can be realized
in experiments by simply adjusting the distance d be-
tween the double pulses, where wl indicates the trans-
verse waist of the second pulse.
The photon beam is
sufficiently narrow that variations in the energy param-
eter, η ∝1 + cos(∆θ/2), are insignificant for the NBW
pair creation process downstream. (For the parameters
we consider, it has been shown [100] that changing the
relative polarisation of the two laser pulses can result in
a change to the final pair yield of about 20%.)
The process of nonlinear Compton scattering has been
broadly discussed in the literature [101–104].
Here, a
similar approach to [96] is used for calculatig the spec-
trum and polarisation of the emitted photon beam within
a specified angular acceptance, see Appendix. B for an
introduction.
Let the Compton photon beam energy
spectrum be dPc/dsc with polarisation Γc(sc), where
sc = η/ηp is fraction of lightfront momentum taken
by the emitted photon from the parent electron and
ηp = k · p/m2 is the energy parameter of the electron.
Then the probability to produce an electron-positron pair
can be written as

where sb = k · q/k · p denotes the fraction of light-front
momentum taken by the created positron from the parent
electron, and the fraction parameter s can now be given
as s = sb/sc. The final spin-correlation density matrix
can be written as

with ρb[s, η, Γc(sc)] calculated from Eq. (11) without the
s-integration and normalizing factor dPb/ds. Again, the
concurrence C(sc) and C(sc, sb) can be calculated from
Eq. (25) by removing the corresponding pre-integrals and
normalizing with the factor dPt/dsc and d2Pt/dscdsb,
respectively.
In the two-stage CP set-up, a 16.5 GeV electron beam
is collided with a 4-cycle CP laser pulse with intensity
parameter ξ = 2, rotation parameter (c = +1) and fre-
quency 1.55 eV, corresponding to an electron energy pa-
rameter ηp = 0.195. As shown in Figs. 8 (a) and (b),
in stage I) high-energy and highly polarised photons are
obtained via nonlinear Compton scattering. By narrow-
ing the angular acceptance ∆θ, the degree of the pho-
ton polarisation can be effectively improved at the cost
of reducing the accepted photon yield [96].
The scat-
tered photons are then collided with a second laser pulse
with the same parameters as in stage I) but with oppo-
site rotation, c = −1, to generate the electron-positron

pair created in the CP set-up. The both laser pulses have
4 cycles, an intensity ξ = 2 and wavelength 0.8 µm. In (a)
and (b), the energy spectrum dPc/dsc and polarisation Γ3(sc)
of the Compton generated photon beam are plotted for two
cases of finite acceptance angle: ∆θ = 32 µrad (red solid line)
and 128 µrad (green solid line). In (c) and (d), the double
lightfront spectrum d2Pt/dscdsb and concurrence C(sc, sb) of
the electron-positron pairs created by the photon beam with
angular acceptance ∆θ = 128 µrad are plotted. Dependence
of the probability dPt/dsc and concurrence C(sc) on the light-
front momentum of the photon is also presented in (c) and
(d) on the right-hand vertical axis respectively. In (e) and (f),
the same quantities are plotted as in (c) and (d) but with the
photon beam acceptance decreased to ∆θ = 32 µrad.
pair spectrum seen in Fig. 8 (c), plotted as the double
light-front spectrum d2Pt/dscdsb of the pairs created by
the photon beam within the acceptance ∆θ = 128 µrad.
The corresponding concurrence C(sc, sb) is then plotted
in Fig. 8 (d). Because of the low degree of photon po-
larisation Γ3 < 0.7 in Fig. 8 (b), the spin of the created
particles is only partially entangled in the low-energy re-
gion sc < 0.25, i.e. the photon energy η = scηp < 0.05,
because of the perturbative effect with the partial photon
polarisation as discussed in Fig. 4 (b). For higher photon
energies (sc > 0.4) the concurrence falls to zero, implying
the pair’s spin states are factorisable as the product of
spin states of single particles. To improve the spin en-
tanglement, one may narrow the angular acceptance for
higher photon polarisation, e.g., ∆θ = 32 µrad shown in
Fig. 8 (e). These highly polarised photons would then
create the pairs with much stronger spin entanglement
shown in Fig. 8 (f), but a considerably reduced total pairs
