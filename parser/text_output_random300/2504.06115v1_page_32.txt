The degenerations of Type Ai and Type Bj discussed in Section 5.1 correspond to nodes
of the surface { det A = 0 } and therefore also to nodes of the double cover Xr. In order to
deduce the number of the nodes of each type, we will take a shortcut and use the Gopakumar-
Vafa invariants of b
Xr
a for a = 3, 4 that can easily be calculated using standard techniques e.g.
from [3].
We denote the divisors on b
Xr that are inherited from the hyperplane classes of the three
P3 factors respectively by J1, J2, J3, and the degree of a curve C ⊂b
Xr by (d1, d2, d3) =
C · (J1, J2, J3). The genus zero Gopakumar-Vafa invariants for d3 = 0 are then as follows:
b

nd1,d2,0

d2 = 0 1 2
d1 = 0

Comparing again with the discussion in Section 5.1, we deduce that the numbers nAi, nBj of
nodes of Type A and B are
(nA1, nA2, nA3, nB1, nB2) =
(
(28, 28, 48, 4, 4) for b
Xr
3 ,
(28, 24, 48, 4, 8) for b
Xr
4 .
(5.36)
Using a random choice of coeﬃcients we have veriﬁed numerically that b
Xr
3 and b
Xr
4 indeed
both have 112 isolated nodes, and that nB1 + nB2 of them correspond to the points where
B(C) or C(z) has rank 1.
5.3
Almost generic octic threefolds X3 and X4
To obtain the geometries X3 and X4 we start again with the corresponding octic threefolds
Xr
a from (4.10) and deform the equation such that we preserve only the nodes of Type A
while smoothing the nodes of Type B. Using (2.11), and
det

= 3 ,
(5.37)
we see that the resulting torsion is B(X3) = B(X4) = Z3. The existence of such a deformation
follows again from the discussion in Section 2.2 and the fact that in both cases nB1 and nB2
are greater than one.
The number of nodes of the diﬀerent types was given in (5.36). After the transition we
ﬁnd that the remaining number of nodes of Type A in X3 and X4 is respectively 104 and 100.
The exceptional curves resolving each of these nodes represent a non-trivial 3-torsion class in
H2( b
Xa, Z) = Z × Z3.
5.4
Mirror symmetry and the conifold transitions b
Xr →(X, [±1]3)
As in Section 2.2, we will now ﬁnd a limit in the complex structure moduli space of the mirror
of b
Xr
a that is dual to the transition b
Xr
a →(Xa, [±1]3) for a = 3, 4. We will ﬁrst discuss the
transition for X3 and then state the corresponding results for X4.
