Fig. 12: Overview for the collaborative shelf clearing scenario
pointingâ€”and the robot uses its perception module to
interpret the scene. This enables the robot to determine
a safe extraction sequence without additional input.
And overview of this can be seen in Figure 11
2) Collaborative Shelf Clearing:
This scenario illus-
trates the benefits of shared tasks between the human
and the robot. During a shelf clearance task, the robot
and human work together by dividing the workload.
For comparison, we also conducted experiments where
the robot cleared the shelf alone and where the hu-
man performed the task independently. Results showed
that human-robot collaboration consistently improved
efficiency and safety. The results for this are shown
in table III. It is important to note, that human and
robot collaboration is slower than human-only due to
the operational speed of the manipulator arm being a
bottleneck. An overview of this experiment is illus-
trated in Figure 12

3) Collaborative Stability Assistance:
In this mode, the robot assists the human during
the extraction process. For instance, while the human
removes a target box, the robot either stabilizes the
neighboring boxes (as seen in Figure 13) that are at
risk of collapse or, alternatively, extracts the box while
the human supports adjacent boxes (as seen in Figure
14).
E. Discussion
The experiments demonstrate that the Human-Robot Col-
laboration Framework enhances shelf-picking tasks. In the
Single Box Picking scenario, the system identifies and
extracts a target box by accurately interpreting the scene
