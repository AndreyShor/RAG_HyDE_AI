excellent agreement with experimental data [31], while for 6Li, our predic-
tions slightly exceed the experimental values. In general, our extrapolated
rms radii are a bit larger than those obtained using a two-dimensional phe-
nomenological exponential extrapolation TTE in the case of 6He [33] and
6Li [32] nuclei. The rms point-proton 6Li radii predicted using the machine
learning methods ISU-a and TUDa are close to ours while the ISU-b pre-
diction lies above the results of all other extrapolations and the experiment.
It is important to note the consistency of the predictions and nearly identi-
cal convergence trends (see Fig. 3) of our approach and that of the TUDa
model for the rms point-proton radius in 6Li contrary to the ISU-a and ISU-b
convergence patterns.
Overall, our results indicate that machine learning oﬀers a promising
tool for addressing longstanding challenges in nuclear many-body theory.
We anticipate that the proposed extrapolation method is rather general and
can be applied to other nuclear observables, such as quadrupole moments,
electromagnetic transition probabilities, etc.
