Note—1 “Other” refers to low-redshift or faint sources with z ≤0.5 or G ≥20.5, for which classification results may be
unreliable due to photometric incompleteness for faint sources and host galaxy contamination at low redshifts. Nevertheless,
all crossmatch and classification results, except for matched DR16Q quasars, are included here for completeness. The faint or
low-redshift DR16Q quasars are excluded from the statistical analyses in Section 3 and are therefore not presented here.

pairs (32/111) with separations of < 1.′′5 have in fact star
superpositions. However, these results are not entirely
reliable, as some faint sources do not have significant
contribution to the total SDSS spectrum, and Gaia’s
PM detection accuracy is limited for faint or low-redshift
close pairs. Therefore, while we present the PCA results
for these low-redshift or faint targets in Tables 1 and 2,
we exclude them from further statistical analysis.
After the removal of the foreground star superposi-
tions, most of the remaining 136 pairs with z > 0.5 and
G < 20.5 should be double quasars, including genuine
dual quasars and lensed quasars. Although many grav-
itationally lensed quasars have been identified through
various surveys, such as Gaia and follow-up observations
(e.g., Lemon et al. 2019, 2023), the completeness of cat-
alogs of confirmed lensed quasars is difficult to quantify
due to the challenge of distinguishing them from physi-
cally associated dual quasars (e.g., Chen et al. 2023b; Li
et al. 2023a; Gross et al. 2023). Consequently, it is not
possible to fully exclude lensed quasars from our sample
or remove their influence on statistical analyses.
Nevertheless, we attempt to identify lensed quasars
within our Gaia-resolved pairs sample. First, we com-
pile a catalog of lensed quasars from the literature, which
includes entries from the Gravitationally Lensed Quasar
Database (Lemon et al. 2019) as well as other newly con-
firmed lensed quasars reported after 2019 (Delchambre
et al. 2019; Lemon et al. 2020, 2023; Hawkins 2021; Jae-
lani et al. 2021; Stern et al. 2021; Chan et al. 2022; Desira
et al. 2022; Li et al. 2023a; Napier et al. 2023; Tub´ın-
Arenas et al. 2023; Dux et al. 2023, 2024; Schwartzman
et al. 2024). It is possible that additional sources ob-
served in the literature are missing from these resources.
For completeness, we cross-match all 2,497 unique pairs
from the initial pair sample with this compiled lensed
quasar catalog. We identify 59 pairs among the 2,497
as lensed systems based on follow-up observations, 40
of which meet the redshift and magnitude thresholds of
z > 0.5 and G < 20.5. These publicly reported cases are
labeled in the “KNOWN” column in Table 2, with ref-
erences to their source literature provided in the “REF-
ERENCE” column.
Among the 136 quasar-like companions at z > 0.5 and
G < 20.5, classified via proper motion and PCA inspec-
tion, 36 are known lensed quasars in the compiled lens
catalog. Additionally, four systems classified as quasar-
star pairs based on our Gaia proper motion criterion and
PCA inspection are in fact confirmed lensed quasars.
Below we examine these four mis-classified systems in
detail:
• J1355306.34+113804.7 (with a 1.′′39 separation)
has a companion with a proper motion significance
of PMSIG2 ≈6, as also reported in Shen et al.
(2023a). For comparison, the median proper mo-
tion significance for pairs classified as quasar-star
systems is approximately 25. This may be a rare
case where Gaia’s proper motion measurement is
influenced by a nearby bright neighbor.
• J095122.57+263513.9 and J133222.62+034739.9
(with separations of 1.′′10 and 1.′′12, respectively)
have companions with PMSIG2 values of 3.2 and
3.4, slightly above the threshold of 3. These two
systems are on the boarderline of the selection cri-
terion and may represent quasar-like companions
