used in this experiment are listed in Table II.
The active fluctuation ηact,i is modeled as the compound Poisson process ηact,i(t) = v0,iσD,i(t) where v0,i is the
constant speed of self-propulsion and σD,i(t) takes the values of ±1 following the Poissonian statistics with a fixed
rate r0,i. In the 2D xy-plane, we consider compound Poisson noise in two scenarios: uniform and non-uniform. In
the uniform case, each jump of the active bead has four possible directions: (v0, 0), (0, v0), (−v0, 0), and (0, −v0), all
with equal probability. In contrast, the non-uniform case corresponds to different probabilities assigned to each jump
direction. Specifically for the non-uniform case, we assign a probability of 0.7 to the jump in the direction (v0, 0),
