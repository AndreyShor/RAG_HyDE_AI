By applying the linear analysis and neglecting convective time derivatives, we arrive at 
the following dispersion relation

 is the

0is the electric permittivity of free space. In the limit 
0
G , the above dispersion relation will fold into the dispersion relation for non gravitating 
quantum plasmas.  
 
The first term in the R.H.S of the above dispersion relation is responsible for the 
contribution of higher frequency electron wave and the second term is responsible for the 
contribution of positron mode. The third term comes from the contribution of ion mode. 
Numerical investigations have adopted astrophysical plasma conditions typical of the outer 
layers of compact stars like white dwarfs or neutron stars. These parameters include ion number
