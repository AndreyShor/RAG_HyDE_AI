The HEFT amplitudes for Higgs + three partons in the Regge limit
In the scattering between two partons of momenta p1 and p2, with production of a Higgs
boson of momentum pH with an associated jet, p1p2 →p3H, the relevant (squared) energy
scales are the parton squared center-of-mass energy s12, the momentum transfer t = s13,
the Higgs mass m2
H and the jet-Higgs invariant mass s3H = (p3 + pH)2, where we identify
the jet with the parton of momentum p3.
Then the energy scales are related through
momentum conservation,
s12 + s13 + s23 = m2

In the Regge limit, app. A.1, the light-cone momenta (A.2) are strongly ordered (A.11),
which entails that the rapidities are ordered as
