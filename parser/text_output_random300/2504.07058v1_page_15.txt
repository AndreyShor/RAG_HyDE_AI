Thus, we obtain:

𝑅(𝑈𝑛),𝑈𝑛
⩽𝐶2∥𝑈𝑛∥2
𝐿2(D)+𝐶3.
(2.89)
Using this in the energy estimate:
𝑑
𝑑𝑡∥𝑈𝑛∥2
𝐿2(D)⩽𝐶2∥𝑈𝑛∥2
𝐿2(D)+𝐶3.
(2.90)
Applying Gronwall’s inequality, we conclude:
∥𝑈𝑛(𝑡)∥2
𝐿2(D)⩽𝑀,
(2.91)
Exponential Decay Condition
|𝑅(𝑈𝑛)|⩽𝐶𝑒−𝜁|𝑈𝑛|.
(2.92)
Since 𝑒−𝜁|𝑈𝑛| decays exponentially, the reaction term does not cause uncontrolled growth. More formally, since:
|𝑈𝑛𝑅(𝑈𝑛)|⩽𝐶|𝑈𝑛|𝑒−𝜁|𝑈𝑛| ⩽𝐶,
(2.93)
It follows that:

𝑅(𝑈𝑛),𝑈𝑛
⩽𝐶4.
(2.94)
Thus, the energy estimate simplifies to:
𝑑
𝑑𝑡∥𝑈𝑛∥2
𝐿2(D)⩽𝐶4.
(2.95)
Integrating over 𝑡, we obtain:
∥𝑈𝑛(𝑡)∥2
𝐿2(D)⩽∥𝑈𝑛(0)∥2
𝐿2(D)+𝐶4𝑇.
(2.96)
This implies uniform boundedness. In both cases, we have shown that there exists a constant 𝑀> 0 such that:
sup
𝑡∈[0,𝑇]
∥𝑈𝑛(𝑡)∥𝐿2(D)⩽𝑀.
(2.97)
To prove that {∆𝑈𝑛} is uniformly bounded in 𝐿2(D), we derive an energy estimate. Taking the Laplacian of the
PDE The given equation is:
𝜕𝑈𝑛
𝜕𝑡

2∆𝑈𝑛+ 𝑅(𝑈𝑛).
(2.98)
Applying the Laplacian ∆on both sides,
𝜕
𝜕𝑡∆𝑈𝑛= 1
2∆2𝑈𝑛+ ∆𝑅(𝑈𝑛).
(2.99)
Testing with ∆𝑈𝑛Taking the 𝐿2(D)-inner product with ∆𝑈𝑛,

(2.100)
Using integration by parts and boundary conditions,

∆2𝑈𝑛, ∆𝑈𝑛

Thus,

(2.102)
For the linear growth condition,
|∆𝑅(𝑈𝑛)|⩽𝐶(1 + |∆𝑈𝑛|).
(2.103)
Using Young’s inequality, we obtain:
𝑑
𝑑𝑡∥∆𝑈𝑛∥2
𝐿2(D)⩽𝐶1∥∆𝑈𝑛∥2
𝐿2(D)+𝐶2.
(2.104)
Applying Gronwall’s inequality,
sup
𝑡∈[0,𝑇]
∥∆𝑈𝑛(𝑡)∥𝐿2(D)⩽𝑀.
(2.105)
Thus, {∆𝑈𝑛} is uniformly bounded in 𝐿2(D). Thus, {∆𝑈𝑛} is uniformly bounded in 𝐿2([0,𝑇]; 𝐻2(D)). Assume
the reaction term 𝑅(𝑈𝑛) satisfies the exponential decay condition:
|𝑅(𝑈𝑛)|⩽𝐶𝑒−𝜁|𝑈𝑛|.
