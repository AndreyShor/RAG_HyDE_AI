Abstract
The polarised IKKT matrix model is the worldpoint theory of N D-instantons in a back-
ground three-form flux of magnitude Ω, and promises to be a highly tractable model of
holography. The matrix integral can be viewed as a statistical physics partition function
with inverse temperature Ω4. At large Ωthe model is dominated by a matrix configuration
corresponding to a ‘polarised’ spherical D1-brane. We show that at a critical value of Ω2N
the model undergoes a first order phase transition, corresponding to tunneling into a collec-
tion of well-separated D-instantons. These instantons are the remnant of a competing saddle
in the high Ωphase corresponding to spherical (p, q) fivebranes. We use a combination of
numerical and analytical arguments to capture the different regimes of the model.
