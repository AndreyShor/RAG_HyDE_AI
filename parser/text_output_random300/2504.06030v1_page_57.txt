It is worth noting that in the case where σ2 ∼0 the dynamical system coincides with
that derived from the corresponding Schr¨odinger wave function when ϵ2 ∼0.
i.e.
both descriptions lead to the semi-classical realisation of the classical circular orbit,
as expected, the details of which can be found in NQG I. This can be extended to
the wave function corresponding to the atomic elliptic state giving rise to the semi-
classical Kepler elliptical orbit (see NQG I). This naturally leads us to postulate this
as a potential accretion model for the formation of circular ring galaxies such as Hoag’s
Object (see below) and elliptical ring galaxies such as AM 0644-741 (shown above).

”For we are most fearfully and wonderfully made”
In addition to the spiral nature of the solution if σ2 ∼λ the 3rd component of angular
momentum is approximately twice the classically predicted value! Could this help to
explain dark matter data reproducing the observed rotation curve for galaxies’ gaseous
parts. We intend to explore this further in future work.
In short, we believe that taking this method further to include a vector potential
(possibly derived from a magnetic effect) we can construct an alternative mechanism
capable of revealing a spiral rotation curve as observed within many galaxies which does
not follow the classical picture defined by the observed mass. Furthermore it is possible
