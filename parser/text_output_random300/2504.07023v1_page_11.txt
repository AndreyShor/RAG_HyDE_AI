Figure 6. (top) Time evolution of interaction strength and corresponding temporal fidelity
for the two-component three fermions system subjected to additional constant interaction
G with third-component particle. Along with increasing interaction G small modifications
of optimized driving are needed to achieve the desired final fidelity. (bottom) Sensitivity
of temporal fidelity F(t) on the cut-off K for different interaction strengths with the third
component. For sufficiently low G limiting the Hilbert space of the third-component particle
to two the lowest orbitals is legitimized.
with increasing interaction with the third component G one needs to slightly modify the
control field to maximize the final fidelity. Consequently, the temporal fidelity F(t) is slightly
modified, however the final fidelity is saturated close to the same value. It means that the
final state (after integrating out the third-component particle) is very close to the desired
target state |tar⟩. From this perspective, similarly, as it was checked for imperfections in the
control field, we can argue that although interactions with the external system lead to some
changes in the dynamics of the system, after careful treatment they are not very destructive
for the performance of the proposed protocol.
All the calculations presented in the top row of Fig. 6 were performed for relatively small
interactions G. This allowed us to reduce the Hilbert space of the third component to K = 2
single-particle orbitals (of course we keep cut-off C = 14 for the first two components).
To show that the results are indeed well-converged for these cut-offs, in the bottom row of
Fig. 6 we display temporal fidelities when higher cut-off K is considered. For G = 0.1 the
