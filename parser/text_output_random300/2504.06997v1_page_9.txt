We use 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 and 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 to represent the Brownian diffusion coefficients in brain and scalp, 
respectively. We first simulated a pulsatile waveform of 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 while gradually increasing 
𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 to show the model's performance in recovering the 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 waveform as well as its 
ability to identify the influence of 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠. For the simulations, 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 ranges from 3×10-6 
mm2/s to 9×10-6 mm2/s follows a pulsatile pattern, while the 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 gradually increases from 
5×10-7 mm2/s to 1.5×10-6 mm2/s. Other parameters remain the same as in the baseline condition, 
and one level of noise (middle) was added to the simulated data as described previously. For 
CBFibaseline recovery, we simulated 100 noise-added data samples under the baseline condition 
(Table 3). The mean values of the recovered CBFi from the DL model and the decorrelation speed 
measured using single-exponential fitting across the 100 data samples were used as the baseline 
for calculating relative cerebral perfusion changes, respectively. rCBFi was calculated as rCBFi =
CBFi/CBFibaseline
7,27. 
To quantify CBFi sensitivity, 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 was varied by ±25% and ±50% relative to the baseline, 
while maintaining 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏 in other layers constant. Similarly, 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 was varied by ±25% and ±50% 
relative to the baseline while keeping 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏 in other layers constant, allowing us to evaluate the 
model’s CBFi measurement sensitivity to scalp BFi (SBFi) changes. At each perturbation level, 
100 noise-added datasets were generated. The sensitivity is defined as49: 
𝑆𝑆=
(CBFi −CBFi0)
CBFi0
(𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏−𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏0)
𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏0
,
(10) 
where CBFi and CBFi0 represent the recovered CBFi under perturbed and baseline conditions, 
respectively, 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏 and 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏0 denote the simulated brain or scalp Brownian coefficient at perturbation 
and baseline conditions. For the fitting method, the numerator of Eq. (10) is replaced by the change 
in decorrelation speed. Ideally, a measured CBFi sensitivity close to 100% is preferred, as it 
indicates accurate detection of cerebral blood flow changes. Conversely, a measured CBFi 
sensitivity to SBFi changes close to 0% suggests that the model is robust against SBFi variations, 
minimizing confounding effects from extracerebral blood flow. 
We also calculated the recovered rCBF error by DL and fitting, calculated using below equation: 
𝜖𝜖= (rCBF −𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏) × 100%,
(11) 
where rCBF represents the percentage error in recovered relative flow change.
