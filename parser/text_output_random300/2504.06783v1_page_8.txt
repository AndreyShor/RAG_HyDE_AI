The multiscale characteristics of GMOC and its components such as NADW, ACC-RC, and decadal 
tropical kinetic energy dissipation rates are analyzed in detail using scale decomposition and composite 
analyses. While the GMOCâ€™s fingerprints on historic events have been identified, accurately reconstructed 3-
D ocean currents and GMOC are expected to further provide key insights into the sources of predictability for 
extreme climate phenomena associated with internal modes of the coupled system. With the multiscale 
representation provided by coupled reanalysis data, advanced artificial intelligence and machine-learning 
forecasting methods [45,46] can be further developed to enhance seamless prediction capabilities. First, 
coupled reanalyses with models that can resolve tropical cyclones, ocean mesoscale eddies, clouds, and sub-
mesoscales [47] are essential to boost the multiscale representation of the Earth system. Second, sea-ice genesis 
and melting are inherently multiscale phenomena, encompassing scales ranging from millimeters to thousands 
of kilometers, each playing a uniquely role [48]. This multiscale complexity poses specific challenges to high-
resolution sea-ice modeling in both thermodynamic processes and rheological dynamics [48,49]. Given the 
booming availability of multisource multisphere data, refined coupled reanalysis that incorporates such data 
into high-resolution models with deep machine-learning schemes shall provide a plausible way to break such 
bottlenecks.
