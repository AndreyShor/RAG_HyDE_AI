Two comments are in order. First, p+1Fp
{ai}
{bj} is symmetric wrt. permutations of both index sets. In the
case at hand this means that up to variable transformations one other Euler-integral can be derived. In that
case, the first sum yields 3F2 as before, but the second sum is not of geometric type. It is a 2F1 so that in
total a three-parameter integral is obtained. A further two equivalent representations are obtained taking the
sum in n2 before that in n1. We will not study the latter three Euler integrals here.
Second, how can we hope to extract a γ1 δ1 component from the Laurent expansion of (13)?
Simply
expanding the numerator in γ, δ we obtain logarithms and thus integrable singularities, so that the entire
expression seems of minimal order δ2 (before differentiation) due to the factor sin[πδ]2 up front. Thus direct
integration of the expanded integrand clearly fails. On the other hand, Euler integrals are the true realm
of intersection theory for hypergeometric functions [7]. An application has been given also in the context of
N = 4 gluings in [6], although primarily with the intention of simplifying the integration. However, here
the use of intersection theory seems mandatory as it resolves the conundrum about the leading orders of the
Laurent expansion revealing a simple pole in δ of the integral in (13).

Bivariate intersection theory for the one-loop box
We review the necessary minimum of information closely following [14, 15, 16], though specialising to the case
at hand. Consider 2-forms
ϕL = ˆϕL(s, t) ds ∧dt ,
ϕR = ˆϕR(s, t) ds ∧dt .
(14)
These forms will be rational and so have a polynomial numerator and a number of denominator polynomials.
The aim is to compute integrals of the type
I =
ZZ 1
0
w(s, t) ϕL
(15)
forming a family, i.e. various integrals which may have some polynomial numerator, and in which the elements
of the set of all denominators {p1 . . . pn} can be raised to non-negative integer powers. The factor w defining
the twisted cohomology is the product of all possible denominators raised to some small non-integer power.
To be concrete, in our example (13) the possible denominators are
{p1 . . . p6} = {s, 1 −s, t, 1 −t, 1 −s t u, 1 −s −t + s t −s t v}
(16)
and the twist factor is
w = sγ+δ(1 −s)−δtγ+δ(1 −t)−δpρ
5 pρ
6 .
(17)
Later, we will rescale γ →γ ϵ, δ →δ ϵ, ρ →ρ ϵ, where ϵ plays the rˆole of a dimensional regulator. The first
four factors in w do in fact regularise the integral at the boundaries of the integration region. We may choose
the powers of p1 . . . p4 as in (13). Yet, similar factors involving p5, p6 are needed at intermediate stages of the
computation. At the end of the computations (13) is recovered in the limit ρ →0.
Intersection theory allows us to decompose the most general integral in the family in terms of a set of
masters. Let
ˆωs = ∂s log(w) ,
ˆωt = ∂t log(w) .
