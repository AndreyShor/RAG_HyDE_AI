for the global dataset decreases from 1.162 to 1.151, corresponding to an improvement by
about 50 units in absolute χ2. The main contributions to this decrease comes from neutral
current deep-inelastic scattering and LHC gauge boson production data.
The valence component is nonzero and positive at more than one sigma level in the x ∈[0.2, 0.4]
region, and consistent with zero within the large PDF uncertainties elsewhere. All other PDFs
are mostly left unaffected by having allowed for a non-vanishing valence charm.
Whereas in our default determination we have imposed the charm valence sum rule Eq. (3.9),
we have also repeated our determination without imposing this theoretical constraint. We
then obtain Qc = 0.07 ± 0.14 and the resulting charm PDFs are shown in Fig. 3.16. This result
demonstrates that the valence sum rule is actually enforced by the data, and our result is
data-driven.
In the following paragraphs we prove that the size and shape of the valence charm PDF seen in
Fig. 3.15 are stable upon variations of PDF parametrization basis, the value of mc, the input
dataset, and the kinematic cuts in W 2 and Q2.
