Proof of Theorem 1.1
In this section, we prove Theorem 1.1.
We deal with the interior case in Section 5.1 and the
boundary case in Section 5.2.

Interior four-arm event for CLE
Proof of (1.4) in Theorem 1.1. By Lemma 4.11, it suffices to show that
P(E2(ε, r)) ≍εξ4(κ).
(5.1)
Let us first perform the following exploration process, see Figure 5.1.
For i = 1, 2, let ℓi,1 be
the horizontal line which goes from e(i−1)π to re(i−1)π. Let ℓi,2 (resp. ℓi,3) be the clockwise (resp.
counterclockwise) arc on ∂Br from re(i−1)π to the first point that it intersects ∂Br/10(r). Let ℓi be
the concatenation of the three curves ℓi,1, ℓi,2 and ℓi,3, in this order. Note that ℓi is not a curve, but
a succession of three curves. We trace every loop in Γ that ℓi encounters in the counterclockwise
direction, in the order that ℓi encounters them. We stop this exploration the first time that we
reach Br/2, namely we stop at a time that we are tracing along a loop γi that intersects Br/2,
exactly at the moment that γi reaches ∂Br/2, so that we have discovered a piece bγi of γi. If none
of the loops in Γ intersect both ℓi and ∂Br/2, then we stop this process at the time that we have
discovered all the loops in Γ that intersect ℓi.
On the event Ei that there exists a loop in Γ which intersects both ℓi and ∂Br/2, we define γi and
bγi just as above. Let ai and bi be the endpoints of bγi (traced from ai to bi in the counterclockwise
direction). Let ti be the first time (according to the parametrization of ℓi) that ℓi intersects γi. Let
Ki be the union of bγi, ℓi((0, ti)) together with all the loops in Γ that ℓi((0, ti)) intersects. Let E3
be the event that E1 ∩E2 occurs. On the event E3, let U be the connected component containing
0 of D \ K1 ∪K2. Let f be the unique conformal map from U onto D with f(0) = 0 and f(a1) = 1.
Let Σ be the σ-algebra generated by E3, bγ1, bγ2 and by all the loops in Γ that ℓi((0, ti)) intersects.
Note that f and U are measurable w.r.t. Σ. Conditionally on Σ and on E3, the image of (γ1 ∪
γ2)\(bγ1 ∪bγ2) under f is a pair of chordal 2-SLEκ in D with the endpoints f(b1), f(a1), f(b2), f(a2),
that we denote by (eγ1, eγ2). Note that the pairing pattern of the 2-SLEκ is not measurable w.r.t.
