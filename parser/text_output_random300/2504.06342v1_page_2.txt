1. INTRODUCTION
The interaction between supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies represents a
fundamental aspect ofgalaxyevolution (Somerville
& Dav¬¥e 2015; Naab & Ostriker 2017; Crain & van
de Voort 2023). Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feed-
back, which encompasses the energy and momen-
tum injected into the interstellar medium (ISM)
and circumgalactic medium (CGM) by the cen-
tral SMBH, plays an indispensable role in regu-
lating the growth of both galaxies and SMBHs,
as well as shaping the properties of galaxies and
their environments (Tumlinson et al. 2017; Faucher-
Gigu`ere & Oh 2023). AGN feedback is considered
responsible for several observed scaling relations
between SMBHs and their host galaxies, includ-
ing the ùëÄBH ‚àíùúérelation, the ùëÄBH ‚àíùëÄbulge re-
lation, and the ùëÄBH ‚àíùêøbulge relation (Magorrian
et al. 1998; Tremaine et al. 2002; Gebhardt et al.
2000; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; H¬®aring & Rix
2004; G¬®ultekin et al. 2009; Kormendy & Ho 2013;
Zhuang & Ho 2023). Moreover, AGN feedback
contributes significantly to the quenching of star
formation in massive galaxies, the suppression of
cooling flows in galaxy clusters, and the heating of
the CGM (Croton et al. 2006; Li et al. 2015; Su
et al. 2021; Zhu et al. 2023b).
Significant research efforts over the past few
decades have focused on understanding the physi-
cal processes of AGN feedback and its impact on
galaxy evolution (Di Matteo et al. 2005; Springel
et al. 2005; Hopkins et al. 2006; Croton et al. 2006;
Sijacki et al. 2007; Gaspari et al. 2012; Li et al.
2015; Zinger et al. 2020; Su et al. 2021, etc.). How-
ever, substantial challenges persist in the theoretical
modeling of these feedback processes and in rec-
onciling theoretical predictions with observations.
‚àóThese authors contributed equally to this work.
A primary challenge stems from the inherently
multi-scale nature of AGN feedback, which spans
a vast range of spatial and temporal scales - from
the accretion disk around the SMBH to the large-
scale environment of the galaxy and its CGM. The
AGN duty cycle, representing the episodic nature
of black hole accretion and feedback, involved with
timescales ranging from brief bursts of 0.1 Myr to
extended active phases approaching ‚àºGyr. This
variability reflects the complex interplay between
gas availability and accretion processes on par-
sec scales, coupled with feedback mechanisms and
CGM dynamics on kiloparsec scales and beyond,
which collectively regulate black hole growth and
star formation in host galaxies.
Beyond the scale-related challenges, AGN feed-
back manifests in diverse forms determined by
the accretion rate of the central SMBH: the cold
(or quasar/radiative) mode and the hot (or ra-
dio/kinetic) mode (Fabian 2012). The cold mode,
occurring when the SMBH accretes near and above
the Eddington rate, is characterized by intense radi-
ation and powerful winds (Murray & Chiang 1995;
Bottorff et al. 1997). This mode, typically asso-
ciated with luminous quasars, drives large-scale
outflows that heat and expel gas from the galaxy,
thereby suppressing star formation (Springel et al.
2005; Hopkins et al. 2006). Conversely, the hot
mode, associated with lower accretion rates, gen-
erates relativistic jets and weaker winds (Yuan
& Narayan 2014).
This mode, common in low-
luminosity AGNs, inflates bubbles and cavities in
the hot gas of galaxy clusters, preventing gas cool-
ing and subsequent star formation (Li et al. 2015;
Su et al. 2021).
The feedback energy, originat-
ing from gas accretion onto the SMBH, manifests
through various mechanisms including kinetic en-
ergy of jets and winds (Yuan et al. 2015), tur-
bulent heating, shock thermalization (Bambic &
Reynolds 2019), radiation pressure (Costa et al.
