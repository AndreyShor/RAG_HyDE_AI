shots. Hence, the 80-20 split was not followed. Instead, the last 99 snapshots were used
for validation, and the preceding 200 for training. The data set encompasses the three
velocity components (u, v, w), representing the streamwise, normal, and spanwise flow
directions, respectively.

Figure 16: (a) Ground truth streamwise velocity components at t = 528. (b) Comparison
of the predicted streamwise velocity components for HOSVD (left column) and SVD (right
column) across different LSTM architectures. From top to bottom: predictions for LSTM
with 1 Dense, 2 Dense, and Time-Distributed architectures.
Figure 16 compares the predicted streamwise velocity components for the 3D cylin-
der flow, showing that all models effectively capture the main flow structures. HOSVD
provides smoother, more coherent predictions, while SVD remains accurate it shows slight
inconsistencies. For the normal velocity component, HOSVD and SVD consistently repro-
duce flow structures with minimal artifacts. The spanwise velocity component presents
the greatest challenge due to the dominance of zero and near-zero low-velocity regions.
SVD and HOSVD struggle to predict the flow features accurately. The 1 dense SVD-based
model performs the worst, failing to adequately capture spanwise velocity structures, lead-
