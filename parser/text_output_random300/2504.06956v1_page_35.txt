Local structure of extremal points

Before proceeding with the proof of Lemma 4.22, we state and prove the following auxiliary result
concerning the tail behaviour of the second derivative of the field Zb.
Lemma 4.24. There exists a constant c > 0 such that for any b ∈N, r ∈[0, eb], i, k ∈[d], and
η ≥0,
P

sup
|x|≤r
|∂2
i,kZb(x)| > η

≲1 ∧rde−cη2 .
(4.55)
Proof. Recall that, for x, y ∈Bb,
E[∂2
i,kZb(x)∂2
i,kZb(y)] =
Z b
0
(e−4sKi,i,k,k(e−s(x −y)) −e−4sKi,k(e−sx)Ki,k(e−sy))ds ,
where, given n ∈N and (j1, . . . jn) ∈[d]n, we write Kj1,...,jn for the n-th derivative of K along the
directions ej1, . . . , ejn. In particular, by the smoothness of K and the fact that it is supported in the
unit ball, it holds
E[|∂2
i,kZb(x) −∂2
i,kZb(y)|2] ≲|x −y|2 ∧1 ,
where the implicit constant is independent of b. It follows from Fernique’s majorizing criterion
(Lemma C.3) and Borell-TIS inequality (Lemma C.2) that, for any η ≥0 and for some c > 0, one has
the bound
P

sup
|x−y|≤1
|∂2
i,kZb(x)| > η

≲e−cη2 ,
uniformly over y. The requested estimate then follows from the union bound.
Before proceeding with the proof of Lemma 4.22, we introduce some notation. For r ≥0, we set
Sr
def=
sup
i,k∈[d], x∈B(0,r)
|∂2
i,kΥb,g(x)| ,
(4.56)
where, to simplify the notation, we have omitted the dependence of Sr on the parameter b. Furthermore,
recalling the characterisation (4.1) of the field Φb, for any i, k ∈[d] and x ∈Bb, we have
∂2
i,kΥb,g(x) =
Z b
0
e−2sKi,k(e−sx)dBs+∂2
i,kZb(x)−
√
2d
Z b
0
e−2sKi,k(e−sx)ds+∂2
i,kgb(x), (4.57)
where we have used the same notation introduced in the proof of Lemma 4.24.
The reason why it is useful to look at the second derivative of the field Υb,g is due to the following
observation.
Remark 4.25. For any λ > 0, η ≥0, and 0 < j ≤b, we observe that the following implication holds
|Dλ
0,j(Υb,g)|−1 ≥η
=⇒
Sej > cλη2/d ,
(4.58)
for some suitable constant cλ depending on λ and d. Indeed, if the condition on the right-hand side of
the above display is not satisfied then there exists a ball of area at least η−1 around the maximum of
Υb,g inside Bj where Υb,g is greater than its maximal value minus λ, which contradict the fact that
|Dλ
0,j(Υb,g)|−1 ≥η.
A straightforward consequence of Lemma 4.24 is the following result.
Lemma 4.26. Let A > 0 be fixed. There exist constants c1, c2 > 0 such that for any η ≥0, b ≥j > 0,
and u > −A, it holds that
P0,u,b(Sej > η2/d) ≲1 ∧edj+c1 u
b η2/de−c2η4/d .
