but the value of B||(+ ve) where it appears is curiously around ∼17 −18 mT, similar to the position of the
peak in RBW

as shown in SI-Fig. 5 and 14a.
III. Transient behavior of Rxx in +300 mT →B||stop →−300 mT
We repeat the same thing with similar choices of B||stop, but with ramping the magnet towards −300
mT after the stop interval, i.e., +300 mT→B||stop →−300 mT. The results are demonstrated in SI-Fig. 6a-
f. We have plotted the measured Rxx (top panel), B|| (middle panel), and temperature of dilution MC plate,
TMC (bottom panel) with time, t, adding the 300 second stop interval for each B||stop. The inset in the Rxx
vs. t plots show the Rxx vs. B|| trace along the sweep direction of +300 mT →B||stop →−300 mT. SI-Fig.
6a shows Rxx (top panel), B|| (middle panel) and TMC (bottom panel) with time, t, for B||stop = 0. Just like
we discussed in the previous section, We see that even though in the continuous sweep Rxx follows the tath
of RFW
xx (B||) (at a given ν) continuously, as soon as we stop ramping and hold the magnet at B||stop, Rxx
quickly starts decreasing and settles at a steady state value 5 in a very short time scale during the stop interval
of 300 seconds, irrespective of the value of B||stop. After the stop interval, as soon as we start ramping B||
again towards B|| = −300mT, we see the appearance of a peak around B|| ∼−17.2 mT. Now, for −40 mT
< B||stop < 0, Rxx trace develops a small local maxima with magnet sweep after the stop interval before
recovering the typical values of RFW
xx
(see SI-Fig. 6 and 14a) with B|| sweep towards −300 mT.
SI-Fig.7 shows a comparison of the transient effect observed in Rxx for the two sweep protocols/
schemes introduced in section SI- 5.

: Current driven (IDC) switching in reduced differential magnetoresistance (rDMR)
Near the magic angle, TBG hosts a stable superconducting phase near zero D around ν ∼2 −3 (see main
text). In SI-Fig. 8, we have plotted differential resistance, dVxx/dI, as a function of D.C. bias current, IDC,
for different filling factors around the SC region. Near the optimal doping, νop ∼2.7, we get dVxx/dI ≈0
below the critical current, Ic, before rising sharply and transitioning from a SC state to a normal state.
The differential resistance behavior is in striking contrast with dVxx/dI vs. IDC for other ν values where
superconductivity is not present.
Hysteresis in presence of applied IDC under B||
SI-Fig.s 9a,c,e show how differential resistance, dVxx/dI, changes with increasing B|| up to +300 mT
for |IDC| ≥0 for three representative filling factors around the SC region. With increasing B||, dVxx/dI
is also seen to increase upto a certain value of IDC before the behavior is switched (defined as Is), i.e.,
dVxx/dI decreases with increasing B||. We can perform the hysteresis measurement at a fixed value of
