LOW REGULARITY OF SELF-SIMILAR SOLUTIONS
OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL RIEMANN PROBLEMS WITH SHOCKS
FOR THE ISENTROPIC EULER SYSTEM
GUI-QIANG G. CHEN, MIKHAIL FELDMAN, AND WEI XIANG
Abstract. We are concerned with the low regularity of self-similar solutions of two-dimensional
Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system. We establish a general framework for the
analysis of the local regularity of such solutions for a class of two-dimensional Riemann problems
for the isentropic Euler system, which includes the regular shock reflection problem, the Prandtl
reflection problem, the Lighthill diffraction problem, and the four-shock Riemann problem. We
prove that it is not possible that both the density and the velocity are in H1 in the subsonic
domain for the self-similar solutions of these problems in general.
This indicates that the
self-similar solutions of the Riemann problems with shocks for the isentropic Euler system are
of much more complicated structure than those for the Euler system for potential flow; in
particular, the density and the velocity are not necessarily continuous in the subsonic domain.
The proof is based on a regularization of the isentropic Euler system to derive the transport
equation for the vorticity, a renormalization argument extended to the case of domains with
boundary, and DiPerna-Lions-type commutator estimates.
1. Introduction
We are concerned with the regularity of self-similar solutions of the Riemann problems with
shocks for the isentropic Euler system in a general setting, including several fundamental shock
problems such as the regular shock reflection problem, the Prandtl reflection problem, the
Lighthill diffraction problem, and the four-shock Riemann problem.
In 1860, Riemann first
considered a special initial value problem with two constant states separated at the origin for
the one-dimensional isentropic Euler system in [43] – now known as the Riemann problem; this
Riemann problem has played a fundamental role in the mathematical theory of hyperbolic sys-
tems of conservation laws, since its solutions are building blocks and asymptotic attractors of
general global entropy solutions. Since then, a systematic theory of one-dimensional hyperbolic
systems of conservation laws has been established; see [5, 6, 11, 22, 30, 35, 41] and the reference
cited therein. However, multi-dimensional Riemann problems are much more complicated and
completely different from the one-dimensional case.
Even for the two-dimensional Riemann
problem with four constant states given in the four quadrants for the Euler system, nineteen
genuinely different configurations have been identified; see [9,10,12,36,47,48]. Since then, rig-
orous global results for the 2-D four-quadrant Riemann problem for the Euler system were only
done by Li-Zheng in [38,39]. See also [20,44] for the 2-D Riemann problem for Chaplygin gases.
On the other hand, the regular shock reflection problem is a different type of multi-dimensional
Riemann problems – a lateral Riemann problem that involves the wedge boundaries. Shock
reflection-diffraction phenomena were first presented by Ernst Mach [42] in 1878, and experimen-
tal, computational, and asymptotic analysis has shown that various patterns of shock reflection
may occur, including regular and Mach reflection; see [15] and the references cited therein.
