• Poleward of 40◦, the circulation changes lead to increased convergence of meridional energy
transport, driven by a combination of the MMC and the eddy transport (Fig. 6), which
provide contributions of comparable magnitudes. Like in the tropics, this is balanced by
increased OLR, but the adjustment mechanism is quite different.
Here, temperature and
specific humidity in the atmosphere change (Figs. 8 and 9) in ways which depend on latitude
(warmer and moister in the equatorward part of the region, cooler and drier in the poleward
part), with specific humidity not following the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling (i.e, there are
substantial relative humidity changes; see Fig. 11). But these changes essentially compensate
in the radiative budget, and the balance is reached by uniformly warming the column and the
surface, i.e. by the Planck response (because this is not possible in the fixed-SST case, the
surplus of energy is absorbed by the surface fluxes).
5. Linking changes in the atmospheric energy budget and surface temperature: a moist static
energy diffusion model
The above analysis suggests a simple picture, whereby circulation changes directly affect the
surface temperature in mid-latitudes through meridional energy transport changes, and affect it in
the tropics through the radiative effects of relative humidity changes, themselves induced by the
forced circulation change. To further support this argument, we relate the surface temperature
changes described in Section 3 to the radiative budget changes described in Section 4 through an
energy balance model (EBM). This class of models solves the space-dependent energy balance
equations for temperature, without representing explicitly the circulation of the atmosphere, by
assuming that the horizontal energy transport can be viewed as a diffusive process:
𝐶𝜕𝑡𝑇s = 𝑅−𝐺+∇· (𝐷∇ℎ) ,
(6)
where 𝐶is the heat capacity of the layer where the diffusion process happens, 𝑅is the TOA radiative
balance (positive downwards), 𝐺is the surface radiative balance (positive downwards), 𝐷is the
diffusivity coefficient and ℎthe generalized enthalpy used in the diffusive closure. Historically,
dry static energy was used for the diffusive closure, and the model resulted in a diffusion equation
for temperature, with sources and sinks determined by the radiative budget, providing perhaps
the simplest climate model with spatial structure (Budyko 1969; Sellers 1969; North et al. 1981).
