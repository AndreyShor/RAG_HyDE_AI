V + b¯b
LH21 status: NNLOQCD for Wbb known [780] while NLOQCD known for Zbb [781]; Wb¯b with
up to three jets computed at NLOQCD in Ref. [782]; matching to parton shower at NLOQCD
accuracy [783–786]; NLOQCD for Wb¯bj calculated with parton shower matching [787]; multi-jet
merged simulation, combining five- and four-flavour calculations for Z + b¯b production at the
LHC [788].
While the calculation presented in Ref. [780] used the flavour kt algorithm, Ref. [789] pre-
sented results using this time the flavour anti-kt algorithm [347]. To investigate the parametric
freedom in the flavour anti-kt algorithm, the authors performed a comparison to CMS data [790]
which shows good agreement.
While Refs. [791] assumed massless bottom quarks, a new computation, this time with
massive bottom quarks, has been presented in Ref. [792]. The authors argue that using massive
bottom quarks in their calculation avoids the ambiguities regarding flavour assignment that
arises in massless calculations.

LH21 status:
NNLOQCD publicly available for all vector-boson pair production processes
with full leptonic decays, namely WW [196, 201], ZZ [197, 199, 204, 793], WZ [200, 202],
Zγ [195,198,255], Wγ [198]; NLOQCD corrections to the loop-induced gg channels computed for
ZZ [488,794] and WW [795,796] involving full off-shell leptonic dacays; interference effects with
off-shell Higgs contributions known [483,484]; NLO EW corrections known for all vector-boson
pair production processes including full leptonic decays [333,797–804]; Polarised predictions at
NLOQCD WZ [357], at NLOQCD +NLOEW for ZZ [359] and WZ [360], and at NNLOQCD for
WW [365]; combination of NNLOQCD and NLOEW corrections to all massive diboson processes
known [805];
NNLOQCD matched to a parton shower for WW [806,807], Zγ [808], Wγ [809], ZZ [810,811] pro-
duction; N3LL resummation for transverse momentum of WW matched with NNLOQCD [812];
NLOQCD matched to parton showers for the gluon–gluon loop-induced channel [489, 490];
NLOQCD +NLOEW matched to parton shower [335,336,813].
In Ref. [494], the full NLOQCD corrections to the loop induced process gg →ZZ have
been obtained. The crucial two-loop virtual contribution was obtained by combining analytic
results for the massless, Higgs-mediated, and one-loop factorisable amplitudes with numerically
computed amplitudes containing the top-quark mass. The authors have found that the NLO
corrections give a sizable impact at the third order in perturbative QCD (meaning the N3LOQCD
predictions). In Ref. [814], the top-quark loops of the double virtual contribution have been
obtained by an expansion in small transverse momentum. The results have then been combined
with a high-energy expansion in order to provide analytic results valid over the whole phase
space.
In Ref. [815], predictions at NNLOQCD accuracy matched to parton shower were presented
for WW production. An important point in this implementation is that, since the resummation
is performed for the hardest jet transverse momentum, the matching ensures that no large
logarithms appear when applying jet vetoes. The predictions are compared to experimental
measurements of both ATLAS and CMS [816,817] and are found to be in good agreement. In
Ref. [818], threshold resummation for ZZ production at NNLOQCD +NNLL have been presented.
The effect of resummation has been found to be at the level of few per cent. In Ref. [819],
NNLOQCD matched to parton shower have been combined consistently with NLOEW corrections
for WZ production. This was the first time that such accuracy is achieved for a public event
