Fig. 3 shows the expectation value of the Casimir as a function of Ω. This plot shows a first
order transition at large N between the maximally irreducible and almost-trivial representations:

While a first order transition is the most natural interpretation of the numerical results, these
cannot exclude some subtle continuity leading to a higher order transition.

Small deformation and the grand canonical ensemble
Sums over partitions of N can be evaluated more easily in a grand canonical ensemble where the
number N is not fixed. The difficulty in the present case is the moduli space integral. However,
in the small Ωlimit the moduli integral can be done explicitly for all saddles, leading to [3]

More precisely, it can be verified that when Ω2N ≪1 the ‘1-loop’ part (11) of the moduli integral
can be neglected. In this regime the moduli integral becomes D independent Gaussian integrals,
giving (19). In this limit we can put the grand canonical ensemble to good use.
The grand canonical computations below are analogous to the statistical description of BMN
ground states in [16], and earlier work on half-BPS geometries of SYM theory [17]. Those works
aimed to produce a geometry that coarse-grained over individual microstates. The polarised
