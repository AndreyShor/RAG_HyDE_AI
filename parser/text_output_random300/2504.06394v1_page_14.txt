modulus is increased, making the cupula stiffer to the point that 𝜅≫1, the flow ceases to be
symmetric.
We emphasize that although symmetry breaking arises from the breakdown of the
asymptotic ordering between the first and second terms in the series, this does not imply a
loss of asymptotic ordering in the higher-order terms. The symmetry breaking results from a
catastrophic cancellation in the leading-order term, while the first correction remains O(𝜖),
and the subsequent terms are expected to retain their anticipated scaling—indicating that the
series remains well-behaved. We confirm this in the next section by numerically solving the
full nonlinear problem (2.1).
To estimate the critical of 𝜅where the transition occurs, we may write Δ𝑝0 = 𝐴𝑒2𝜋𝑖𝑡+ 𝑐.𝑐.
and 𝑓(𝑡) = 𝐵𝑒2𝜋𝑖𝑡+ 𝑐.𝑐., with 𝐴, 𝐵∈C,and seek the range of 𝜅for which Δ𝑝is in phase
with 𝑓. Direct substitution into (3.9a) yields
𝐴= −𝜋
8𝐼4
𝐵
2𝜋𝛼(𝑏)𝑖+ 𝜅/(16𝐼4) .
(3.18)
Therefore, the transition change occurs at 𝜅𝑐= 32𝐼4𝛼(𝑏). For 𝜅< 𝜅𝑐the phase difference
between 𝐴and 𝐵is more than 𝜋
4 , and it will be less than 𝜋
4 for 𝜅> 𝜅𝑐. When the phase
difference is small the response is roughly in phase with the forcing 𝑓(𝑡), and vice-versa.
3.2.1. Sample head rotation
To visualize the different regimes we have identified above, we solve the equation for the
pressure jump (3.9a) with a specific choice for the forcing 𝑓(𝑡). While many forms of 𝑓(𝑡)
could be considered, we are motivated by a clinical head manoeuvre that may be thought of
as modelling a slow rotation of the head from right to left. Although other clinical models
are described by high-order polynomials (Boselli et al. 2009, 2013), we choose a particular
form that facilitates an analytical solution of the equations, namely:
𝑓(𝑡) = d𝐹
d𝑡=
(
sin 2𝜋𝑡
𝑡∈(0, 1)

𝑡> 1.

Solving for the pressure gradient through (3.12) yields

𝑡> 1.
(3.20)
Here, 𝛽= 𝜋/[8𝐼4𝛼(𝑏)] and 𝛾= 𝜅/[16𝛼(𝑏)𝐼4]. The cupular deformation, which in this
regime is proportional to the pressure jump, is plotted in the left panel of Figure 5 for
different values of 𝜅, from which we can clearly see the transition from Δ𝑝tracking the
angular velocity 𝐹(𝑡) for small 𝜅to tracking the angular acceleration 𝑓(𝑡) for large 𝜅, as
expected from the preceding analysis. There is an interesting transition region for 𝜅∼1,
where we can see an “overshoot” region at the end of the manoeuvre that has not decayed.
This is not the case for either of the limiting regions, where the pressure jump (and cupular
displacement) is identically zero after the completion of the head turn.
In Figure 5(b) we compare how similar the response is to either the angular velocity or the
angular acceleration by computing the correlation between the respective functions; for two
functions 𝑓(𝑡) and 𝑔(𝑡), this correlation is defined as
𝑅( 𝑓, 𝑔) =
