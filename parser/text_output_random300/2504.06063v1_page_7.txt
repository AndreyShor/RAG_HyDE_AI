The coefficients g(p)

mula have to be read as the coordinates of the kernels

σ (ωmax −ω0) on the discrete set of basis-functions
exp[−ω0(amDs)n]. The functional basis has been cho-
sen in order to establish a direct connection between
dΓ(p)(σ)/dω2 and the primary data of a lattice simu-
lation, i.e. Euclidean correlators at discrete time sepa-
rations. Indeed, while it is not possible to compute the
Z(p)(ω0, ω2) distributions directly on the lattice, it is in-
stead possible (see section VI) to compute the following
Euclidean correlators

now easily be established,

necessary σ 7→0 extrapolations we rely on the asymptotic
formulae derived and discussed in section V. Details con-
cerning the numerical evaluation of the ω2 integral will
be provided in section XI.

THE LEPTON-ENERGY MOMENTS
The lepton-energy moments are defined as the integrals
of the differential decay rate multiplied by a power of the
lepton energy (mDseℓ) and normalized by the total rate,
i.e.

In this work we have computed the first two moments,
M1 and M2. To do that, as already done in the case of the
total rate, we performed the eℓintegrals analytically and
then represented M1 and M2 in terms of the smearing
kernels Θ(p)
σ (ωmax −ω0).
