exhibits the 𝑘−1 scaling in the low-wavenumber (large-scale) region, consistent with the
energy distribution observed in canonical wall turbulence. This agreement highlights SWAT’s
capability to resolve the dominant energy-containing motions that govern turbulent transport
processes in the logarithmic region.
The hairpin-vortex-based SWAT model also captures the higher-order dynamics character-
istic of wall-bounded turbulence. Conventional synthetic turbulence models often rely on ad
hoc parameter tuning to match first- or second-order statistics, yet they frequently overlook
the higher-order statistical complexity. The SWAT framework overcomes this limitation
by embedding physically meaningful vortical structures that naturally encode multiscale
interactions and nonlinear dynamics. As shown in figure 5(c), SWAT accurately reproduces
the logarithmic scaling of even-order statistical moments of streamwise velocity fluctuations,
⟨[(𝑢−⟨𝑢⟩)/𝑢𝜏]2𝑝⟩1/𝑝, with respect to the distance from the wall within the logarithmic
sublayer (Meneveau & Marusic 2013).
3.3. Towards higher Reynolds numbers
The nature of coherent structures in high-Reynolds-number wall turbulence remains a topic
of active debate (Wu & Moin 2009; Smits et al. 2011; Eitel-Amor et al. 2015). A central
question is whether simple hairpin vortices can still provide an adequate modeling framework
at extremely high Reynolds numbers. This poses a fundamental challenge for our model, as
the increasing complexity of turbulence may demand a more sophisticated representation of
vortex interactions and energy transfer mechanisms.
To investigate this, we generate synthetic wall turbulence at progressively higher Reynolds
numbers, specifically at 𝑅𝑒𝜏= 2000, 5200, and 10000. Across this range, SWAT consistently
demonstrates its ability to accurately reproduce the mean velocity profile throughout the
near-wall, buffer, and logarithmic regions in figures 6(a,c,e). This agreement underscores the
model’s ability to capture the key statistical features of turbulent boundary layers, even at
very high Reynolds numbers.
Regarding the Reynolds stress distribution, all second-order moments exhibit the ex-
pected logarithmic behavior in the log-law region across all tested Reynolds numbers in
figures 6(b,d,f). Compared to DNS data, SWAT effectively captures the ⟨𝑤2⟩and ⟨𝑢𝑣⟩
components, which are crucial for characterizing turbulence anisotropy and momentum
transfer. Additionally, the model successfully replicates the logarithmic growth trends of the
peak values of ⟨𝑢2⟩and ⟨𝑣2⟩with increasing Reynolds number (Lozano-Dur´an & Jim´enez
2014; Lee & Moser 2015), although the growth rate is slightly overestimated. These results
indicate that SWAT remains a robust framework for modeling the statistical properties of
wall turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds numbers.
4. Application of SWAT in initializing simulations of wall turbulence
Due to the statistical and structural consistency of our synthetic turbulence with real
turbulence, it provides an efficient and cost-effective alternative for initializing numerical
simulations. This approach eliminates the need for extensive computational resources
otherwise required to wait for the flow to transition and fully develop. This advantage is
particularly beneficial in high-fidelity simulations such as DNS of channel flow, where
computational resources are often a limiting factor.
To generate synthetic channel turbulence, hierarchical hairpin vortex packets are indepen-
dently constructed on both the upper and lower walls. For the channel flow configuration,
the boundary layer height is set to half the channel height, 𝛿= 𝐿𝑦/2. Hairpin vortices of
varying hierarchical levels are introduced at each wall, preserving essential features such as
