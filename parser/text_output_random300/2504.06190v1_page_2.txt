1.1 Introduction
In the physics of the fundamental interactions, there are two outstanding
unsolved hierarchy problems: the smallness of the Fermi scale of weak in-
teractions, G−1/2
F
∼10−16 MP , and even more the smallness of the present
vacuum energy density, ρV ∼(10−30 MP )4, with respect to the Planck scale
of gravitational interactions, MP = (8πGN)−1/2 ≃2.4×1018 GeV, as defined
in terms of Newton’s constant GN.
For a long time it has been suspected that the beautiful mathematical
structure and the special ultraviolet properties of supersymmetric theories
may be eventually related to the solutions of the above two problems. In
particular, at the end of the 20th century it was expected by many that the
gauge hierarchy problem would be solved by the existence of supersymmetric
partners of the Standard Model (SM) particles with masses of the order of the
Fermi scale. This expectation has not been borne out by experiment: a light
weakly coupled Higgs boson with mass mh ≃125 GeV has been found at the
LHC, with all its properties measured so far compatible with those predicted
by the SM, and no confirmed direct or indirect signal of supersymmetric
particles has been detected in a broad spectrum of experimental searches,
whose sensitivity goes significantly beyond the Fermi scale.
Still, space-time supersymmetry is an important ingredient of our best
candidate for a consistent quantum theory of all fundamental interactions,
including gravity: superstring theory. Perturbative formulations of super-
string theory contain a single fundamental mass scale, the string scale MS,
and additional spatial dimensions. The first step to make them realistic is to
consider solutions where the extra dimensions are compact. The Planck scale
MP and the compactification scale(s) MC depend on the vacuum expectation
values of certain fields present in the theory and should be determined by
some dynamics on which we do not have full control at present. Supergravity
theories are in general non-renormalizable (the issue is not completely set-
tled for maximal supergravity, which could be finite), therefore they can be
