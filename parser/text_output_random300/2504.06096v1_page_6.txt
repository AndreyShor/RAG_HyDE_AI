Figure 1: Distribution of the invariant mass of Σ+ →pµ+µ−candidates in a restricted mass

illustrated. The full range is shown in the Supplemental Material [52].
vary. The background is described by a modified Argus function [56], where the threshold
parameter is fixed to the sum of the final-state masses and the remaining parameters
are free to vary. The data and the result of the fit are shown in Fig. 1; a signal yield of
NΣ+→pµ+µ−= 237 ± 16 is obtained, where the uncertainty is statistical only. This result
constitutes the first observation of the Σ+ →pµ+µ−decay, obtained with overwhelming
significance. The fit to data is repeated, releasing all parameters of the signal function
that are fixed from simulation in the baseline model. The variation of the signal yield is
negligible, hence no systematic uncertainty is assigned. A similar amount of Σ+ and Σ−
decays are seen in the sample.
The distribution of the dimuon invariant mass is shown for data in Fig. 2 after
background subtraction. The background is subtracted using per-event signal weights
derived with the sPlot method [57] using mpµ+µ−as the discriminant variable. The mpµ+µ−
and mµ+µ−variables are found to be uncorrelated aside from the higher border of the
kinematics space. A consistent distribution is obtained when performing the unbinned
maximum-likelihood fit described earlier in intervals of the dimuon invariant mass. No
significant peaking structures are visible in the data distribution. The data is compared to
the distribution in simulation with the PHSP model and with the SM weighted distribution,
with theoretical uncertainty due to the mentioned parametric ambiguity shown as a red
band shown in Fig. 2. When comparing the data to this SM simulation, rather good
agreement is achieved in the full range.
A scan for possible resonant structure in the dimuon invariant mass is performed by
selecting candidates in the pµ+µ−invariant mass within twice the signal resolution of
the known Σ+ mass, using the same method as in the Run 1 analysis [35], and detailed
in Appendix A.3. Steps of half the resolution on the dimuon invariant mass, σ(mµ+µ−),
are considered in this scan, following the method outlined in Ref. [58]. The value of
σ(mµ+µ−) varies in the range [0.5, 2.0] MeV/c2 depending on the dimuon invariant mass.
For each step, the putative signal is estimated in a window of ±1.5 × σ(mµ+µ−) around
the considered particle mass, while the background is estimated from the lower and upper
mass sidebands contained in the range [1.5, 4.0] × σ(mµ+µ−) for the same mass. Only
one of the two sidebands is considered when the other is outside the allowed kinematic
