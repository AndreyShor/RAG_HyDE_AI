matrix encoding uses a block lower bidiagonal form, the matrix encoding for the Padé relies on a block
upper Hessenberg form.
• The condition number of the Padé approximation encoded matrix L is estimated, which plays a crucial
role in the complexity analysis of the algorithm. Additionally, we propose the block-encoding of the
Padé approximation encoded matrix, along with its detailed quantum circuit implementations.
• We analyze the overall complexities of the proposed quantum algorithm, including both the oracle query
complexity and the quantum gate complexity. When A is Hermitian and negative semi-definite, our
analysis relaxes the common restriction ∥Ah∥2 ≤1 found in other related works [5, 7, 13, 32], where
h represents the time step. Compared to other methods in the first category, the proposed algorithm
outperforms them both theoretically and numerically.
Overall, our proposed quantum algorithm and the corresponding analysis address linear autonomous ODEs.
Extensions to the non-autonomous and/or mildly nonlinear ODEs are feasible using similar techniques as
those in [5, 10, 11, 13].
The complexity analysis for the extended algorithm will need to be rederived
accordingly, and the dependence on parameters requires further investigation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly review the method proposed in [7]. Section
III introduces the linear system encoding via Padé approximation, analyzes the condition number of the linear
system, and details the block-encoding of the linear system. Section
IV presents the complexity analysis
of the proposed algorithm. In Sec. V, we compare our method to the one based on Taylor approximation
[7, 13, 32] and the LCHS-based method [2, 3] theoretically. Moreover, numerical experiments are conducted
to illustrate the advantages of our method over the method based on Taylor approximation. Finally, Sec. VI
concludes the paper with a discussion on future directions.

PRELIMINARIES
Consider a linear differential equation of the form:
(
dx
dt = Ax(t) + b,
t ∈[0, T],
x(0) = x0,
(3)
where A ∈Cn×n and b ∈Cn are time-independent. When A is non-singular, the solution is given by
x(t) = exp(At)x(0) + (exp(At) −In) A−1b,
t ∈[0, T].
In order to prepare the quantum state |x(T)⟩=
x(T )
∥x(T )∥2 , reference [7] approximates the exponential function
exp(·) by its truncated Taylor series
Tk(z) :=
k
X
j=0
zj
j! .
Given a suitable number of time steps m ∈N+ and the time step size h = T/m, the following procedure is
used to approximate x(T):
x(h) ≈Tk(Ah)x(0) + (Tk(Ah) −In) A−1b =: bx(h),
x(2h) ≈Tk(Ah)bx(h) + (Tk(Ah) −In) A−1b =: bx(2h),
...
x(mh) ≈Tk(Ah)bx ((m −1)h) + (Tk(Ah) −In) A−1b =: bx(T).

Then, reference [7] shows that each step of the above procedure can be encoded into a linear system. The
s-th step of the above procedure is encoded in the following linear system:
(
Mk(Ah)z(s) = ys,
bx(sh) −(1T ⊗In)z(s) = 0,
∀s = 1, . . . , m,
