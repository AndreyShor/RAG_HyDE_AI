The time scale is controlled by the form of the potential for χ and the respective coupling
constants. After the transition the scalar ﬁeld φ will get a normal eﬀective mass M and
the tachyonic behavior terminates.

Dynamics of scalar ﬁeld
Before the tachyonic phase, the scalar ﬁeld φ locates at the true vacuum ⟨φ⟩= 0 such
that φ = δφ. The value of δφ can be estimated as ⟨δφδφ⟩= Pφ. When the temperature
of universe is high, the eﬀective potential of φ is simply V (φ) ≃π2̺2T 2φ2/12 so that the
thermal mass is given by m2
T = π2̺2T 2/6. As long as mT < H the scalar ﬁeld remains
frozen. Using the relation (3.33), we get
mT < H →̺ <

as the criteria for the scalar ﬁeld to be frozen.
One may wonder whether the scalar ﬁeld is still frozen after the annihilation epoch,
where the temperature drops below 0.1 MeV. We will evaluate the dynamics of scalar
ﬁeld by assuming that it’s always frozen before the tachyonic phase for the following two
reasons. First, as we show in Sec. 6.2, a sizable magnetic ﬁeld originates from a typically
small value ̺ ∼10−25 and (4.20) holds even when T is of keV order. Second, from the
computations in Sec. 5 and Sec. 6 we conﬁrm that the dynamics of scalar ﬁeld has little
impact on the magneto-genesis process, since any information before the tachyonic phase
is diluted by the exponential growth phase.
