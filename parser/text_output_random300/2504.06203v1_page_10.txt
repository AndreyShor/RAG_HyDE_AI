[118] To illustrate the importance of the closed-ness condition, let
us give one simple example with Hilbert space H = L2(R)
and its dense subspace of Schwarz functions denoted by S.
The densely-defined quadratic form q(f) = f(0)2 for f ∈S
is clearly positive but not closed, because the sequence fn =
e−n2x2 ∈S goes to zero with respect to the norm on H but
fn(0) = 1. This form has a Dirac delta function kernel and is
well-known to be not representible by a densely defined self-
adjoint operator.

Appendix A: More pinning flows and generalizations in 2d CFT
In this appendix, to demonstrate the consequences of our general results on factorization and symmetry properties for pinning
flows, we provide more examples in 2d CFT. We will also discuss generalizations that involve flows from nontrivial topological
defects by turning on operators in twisted sectors.

Pinning flows in diagonal Virasoro minimal models
We will consider three types of pinning field flows in the diagonal Virasoro minimal model Mm,m+1 with m ≥3 which
describes the multicritical point of the Landau-Ginzburg model with φ2(m−1) potential. They are defined by taking the operator
O in (I.1) to be one of the following three scalar primaries,
ϕ2,2 ∼φ , ϕ1,2 ∼: φm−2 : , ϕ2,1 ∼: φm−1 : , with ∆= {
3
2m(m + 1) ,
m −2
2(m + 1) , m + 3
2m } ,
(A.1)
where we have included their conformal weights [95]. The corresponding bulk RG flows have been studied extensively by both
the Truncated Conformal Space Approach (TCSA) and integrability (for the last two types in (A.1)) [86, 96–101]. Furthermore,
the symmetries and the boundary conditions of these minimal models are well-known. The simple topological defects Lr,s and
boundaries |r, s⟩are in one-to-one correspondence with the Virasoro primaries ϕr,s with 1 ≤r ≤m + 1, 1 ≤s ≤m subjected
to the identification {r, s} ↔{m + 1 −r, m −s}. In particular, the symmetry action on the local operators
Lr1,s1ϕr2,s2 = Sr1,s1;r2,s2
S1,1;rs,s2
ϕr2,s1 ,
(A.2)
is given by the modular S-matrix,
Sr1,s1;r2,s2 = 2

.
(A.3)
This is compatible with the following fusion rule of the topological defects as a consequence of the Verlinde formula,
Lr1,s1 ◦Lr2,s2 =
min(r1+r2−1,2m−1−r1−r2)
M
r=1+|r1−r2|,r+r1+r2∈2Z+1
min(s1+s2−1,2m+1−s1−s2)
M
s=1+|s1−s2|,s+s1+s2∈2Z+1
Lr,s .
(A.4)
In particular L1,m generates the invertible Z2 symmetry of Mm,m+1 and the charge of ϕr,s is (−1)(m−1)r+ms+1.
The conformal boundaries are obtained by topological fusion with the identity brane |1, 1⟩whose g-function is determined by
the S-matrix (A.3),
|r, s⟩= Lr,s|1, 1⟩,
g|1,1⟩=
