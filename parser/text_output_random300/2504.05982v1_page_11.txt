Figure 3: (a) Speedup in MetaD simulations of the two-dimensional modiﬁed Faradjian-
Elber potential as a function of the CV quality. The quality is measured by the rotation
angle relative to the optimal CV. Results are given either with or without resetting, in orange
triangles and green squares, respectively. (b) Survival functions S(t) for transitions between
an “unfolded” and “folded” conformers of alanine tetrapeptide, in unbiased simulations
(upper left) and MetaD simulations with a good CV (φ3 dihedral angle, upper right), a
suboptimal CV (ψ3, lower left), or a poor CV (φ2, lower right). (c) An illustration of the
eﬀect of MetaD bias on the eﬀective free energy. Representative unbiased and biased FESs
are given in blue and green, respectively. The black hollow circle represents a system on the
biased surface, far from the energy barrier.
CVs. The bias is deposited on-the-ﬂy at visited regions of the low-dimensional CV space,
encouraging the exploration of poorly visited areas. In the popular well-tempered version,26
the bias is guaranteed to converge, such that at long times the eﬀective free energy surface
in the simulation is

γF(s), with F(s) being the true free energy along CV s and γ > 1,
called the bias factor, is a control parameter. However, the time for convergence is unknown
a priori and can be long. Furthermore, the eﬃciency highly depends on the choice of CV:
if F(s) poorly reﬂects the slowest modes of the system, acceleration of rare transitions is
limited.
Figure 3(a) demonstrates the dependency of the acceleration on CV choice through the
example of the modiﬁed Faradjian-Elber potential (Figure 2(a)). There, the optimal CV
is the x-axis. In Ref.,39 we artiﬁcially degraded the quality of the CV by rotating it at an
angle θ with respect to the x-axis and measured ﬁrst-passage from the right minimum to the
left basin (x < −1 ˚A). The speedup as a function of θ is plotted with green squares. It is
