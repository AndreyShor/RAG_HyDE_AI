Warm-Start QAOA via a Reduction to Max-Cut

• Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This problem asks for the route between 5 points that are randomly
placed onto [−1, 1]2 which visits each city exactly once while minimizing the distance.
• Portfolio Optimization. This problem begins by simulating a set of stock prices over a fixed time duration,
and then computing the covariance and mean return of each asset. The optimization then seeks to find the
best combination of stocks to buy to simultaneously maximize the return, minimize the risk, and satisfy a
predetermined budget constraint.
• Maximum Independent Set (MIS). This problem begins with an unweighted, connected graph, and then
aims to determine the largest set of verticies 𝑆such that no two elements of 𝑆share an edge. We study this
problem on two different graph ensembles, the Erdős–Rényi (GNP) model and the Newmann-Watts-Strogatz
(NWS) model.
Visualizations of these problems are provided in Figure 1. A more detailed background of each problems is
provided in Appendix B.

warmstarts, we tested rotations on the first qubit,
the last qubit, and none of the qubits. The choice of rotating the first qubit was chosen arbitrarily: since these
problem instances are random, the distribution of the 𝑄matrix elements (of the corresponding QUBO) should
be invariant under permutations of rows/columns. However, after transforming the problem into a Max-Cut
instance, the last qubit will have a different structure due to it’s special role in the mapping in (8). The depth-0
data in Appendix C provides empirical support for this.
For all of the following problems, 1000 instances were generated and ran at depth 𝑝= 0 (see Appendix C)
and 10 of those 1000 were selected to be run at depths 1 ≤𝑝≤5. Each problem is a QUBO in 16 variables with a
corresponding 17-vertex corresponding graph.

Results
Experimental parameters can be found in Appendix E.
For 𝑝= 0, 1, . . . , 5, we present the data for the GW2 warmstart in Figure 3. Full Depth Data for GW3, BM2,
and BM3 is provided in Figure 7. GW2 was selected as the representative warmstart because it obtained instance-
specific approximation ratios and optimal sampling probabilities which were either comparable to or better than
the other warmstarts considered.
While both BM2 and BM3 perform comparable to the GW warmstarts in terms of their obtained instance-
specific approximation ratio, they obtain significantly lower optimal sampling probabilities. This is likely due to
the warmstarts finding relatively high cost solutions, but not necessarily optimal ones.
Because the relaxation corresponding to the QUBO-Relaxed warmstart is not convex, there are no guaran-
tees on its performance. We use a LFBBGs optimizer to estimate 𝑦𝑐, and vary the number of random initial
conditions.7 To give a fair comparison between this warmstart and the others, we compare its performance with
both 10 random initializations and 50 random initializations. As can be seen in the corresponding figures, there is
a notable difference in performance between 50 and 10 initializations for certain problems.
7Portfolio Optimization is actually a QUBO-Relaxed problem when relaxed, so we can solve for 𝑦𝑐directly using QUBO-Relaxed programming.
Thus, the number of random initializations does not matter for Portfolio Optimization.
