Introduction 
Wealth inequality is a significant global social problem. According to the 
World Inequality Report 2022, the top 10% of the wealthy account for 76% of the 
world’s wealth, and the top 1% account for 38% [1]. The traditional “elephant curve” 
is now being replaced by the “Loch Ness monster curve” [1,2]. In the elephant curve, 
the growth rates of the middle class in emerging countries and the wealthy in developed 
countries were high, whereas that of the middle class in developed countries was 
negative. In the LochNess monster curve, the growth rate of the middle class in 
emerging economies is declining, the growth rate of the super-wealthy in developed 
countries is the only one that is outstanding, and inequality continues to increase. 
 Wealth inequality can be viewed as a consequence of capitalism. In other 
words, the capitalist economy has grown through the enclosure of the commons, which 
leads to the enslavement of labor and the colonization of resources [3–5]. The GDP 
growth contributes to the wealth of capitalists and executives but continues to increase 
the consumption of resources and energy. Growing inequality reduces well-being, and 
resource consumption causes environmental problems. To reduce wealth inequality and 
resource consumption, including improving well-being, and restoring the natural 
environment, an alternative to the capitalist economy is required. 
As modified versions of the current capitalist system, economist Freeman’s 
stakeholder capitalism [6], economist Stiglitz’s progressive capitalism [7], and 
philosopher Gabriel’s ethical capitalism [8] have been proposed. As alternatives to 
capitalism, the moral economy have been proposed by economist Bowles [9], and the 
community economy have been proposed by economist Rajan and public-policy
