provided that k > bc. It is natural to choose k such that k2/(2b) = b(d −1), i.e., k = b√2(d −1)
which is indeed greater than bc since c =

2/d < √2(d −1). Therefore, recalling (5.6) and
combining the previous observations, we conclude that

Therefore, by plugging the previous bound into (5.5), we showed that the expectation in (5.4) is

We are now ready to prove the following intermediate result.
Lemma 5.5. There exists a countable set Λ
c ⊆R+ such that, letting Λ = R+ \ Λ
c, for each n ∈N
and λ ∈Λ ∩(0, n], it holds that ν∞,λ = ν∞,n|Aλ.
Proof. Thanks to Lemma 5.4, we know that for each λ > 0, the sequence (νb,λ)b>0 converges weakly
to ν∞,λ in (X, dX). Moreover, for all n ∈N, λ ∈(0, n], and b > 0, we have that νb,λ = νb,n|Aλ.
We note that there exists a countable set Λ
c
n ⊆(0, n] such that for all λ ∈(0, n] \ Λ
c
n, it holds that
νb,λ converges weakly to ν∞,n|Aλ in (X, dX). Indeed, this follows from the uniqueness of the weak
limit and the fact that the sets (∂XAλ)λ∈(0,n] are disjoint, implying that ν∞,n can assign positive
mass to at most countable many of them. Therefore, the conclusion follows by setting Λ
c = ∪n∈NΛ
c
n
and noting that a countable union of countable sets remains countable.
We are now ready to prove Lemma 5.1
Proof of Lemma 5.1. We begin by observing that an immediate consequence of Lemma 5.5 is that for
each λ1 ̸= λ2 ∈Λ such that λ2 < λ1, the field eΥλ2 has the same law of the field eΥλ1 conditioned on
the event M(eΥλ1) ≤λ2.
For θ > 0, we introduce the set Sθ,1 ⊆X by letting
Sθ,1
def= {(∞, ϕ) ∈X : M(ϕ) = θ} .
