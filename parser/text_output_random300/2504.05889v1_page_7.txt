Within the MAPbBr3 framework, iodide substitution
makes both the valence band maximum and the con-
duction band minimum shift downwards, reducing the
band gap from 1.9010 eV to 1.7126 eV (Table II). This
is because of the lower electronegativity and bigger ionic
radius of the iodide ion in comparison to bromide, which
alters orbital interaction and energy level alignment. Fur-
thermore, the effective masses of charge carriers are re-
duced in MAPbBr2I, with the electron effective mass de-
creasing from 0.268 to 0.170 and that of the hole from
0.222 to 0.194, thereby suggesting higher carrier mobility
beneficial for optoelectronic applications.
A comparable trend is observed in the SbH4PbBr3 and
SbH4PbBr2I structures.
For SbH4PbBr3, the valence
band and conduction band edges are located at 3.6940 eV
and 5.4169 eV, respectively, resulting in a band gap of
1.7229 eV (Table II). In SbH4PbBr2I, the corresponding
band edges shift to 3.4400 eV and 5.0579 eV, yielding a
reduced band gap of 1.6179 eV. However, in this system
the electron effective mass increases from 0.289 to 0.360,
while the hole effective mass decreases slightly from 0.182
to 0.175. These changes indicate that the iodide substi-
tution produces a more complex impact on the charge
carrier dynamics by adversely affecting electron mobility
while modestly enhancing hole transport.
The
comparative
analysis
of
MAPbBr2I
and
SbH4PbBr2I
perovskites
clearly
illustrates
the
cru-
cial role of the A-site cation in the electronic structure.
The DOS plot for the MAPbBr2I and SbH4PbBr2I struc-
tures is presented in Figure 8, while the corresponding
electronic band structure is illustrated in Figure 9. The
valence band is primarily composed of halogen (Br−, I−)
orbitals, while the conduction band edge is composed
of empty Pb orbitals.
However, when looking at the
degree to which the contribution from MA+ and SbH+
4
cations is made, SbH+
4 contributes proportionately more,
particularly in determining the minimum conduction
band (CBM). In MAPbBr2I, organic MA+ cation creates
lower energy valence and conduction bands, whereas the
inorganic SbH+
4
cation in SbH4PbBr2I engages more
with the nearby halide ions and shifts these bands to
higher energy.
While SbH4PbBr2I possesses a slightly
narrower band gap than MAPbBr2I, as can be seen from
Table II, band edge position changes and the associated
effective mass changes result in extreme changes in both
optical absorption and charge transport properties.
In the case of the MA-based compounds, MAPbBr2I
exhibits lattice parameters of a = 5.952 ˚A, b = 5.989 ˚A,
and c = 6.362 ˚A, whereas MAPbBrI2 shows slightly
increased values of a = 5.947 ˚A, b = 6.359 ˚A, and
c = 6.407 ˚A. This moderate expansion, particularly along
the c-axis, is attributed to the larger ionic radius of I−
relative to Br−. The optimized structures of MAPbBrI2
and SbH4PbBrI2 are presented in Figure 10, and the
corresponding data for these structures are listed in Ta-
ble I. The bond lengths further corroborate these find-
ings; MAPbBr2I has Pb–I and Pb–Br bond lengths of
3.20 ˚A and 3.03 ˚A, respectively, while in MAPbBrI2 these
bonds are slightly elongated to 3.22 ˚A and 3.06 ˚A. The
increase in the number of I−ions in MAPbBrI2 also af-
fects the hydrogen bond network. The H–I bond length,
which is 2.60 ˚A in MAPbBr2I, increases to 2.64 ˚A with
the increase in the number of I−ions in the lattice. The
optimized structures shown in Figure 10 are the struc-
tures with the lowest energy among the tested configura-
tions. In these structures, hydrogens prefer to bond with
the I ion when compared to the Br−ion. As can be seen
in the structures obtained as a result of the calculations
in Figure 10, no H–Br bond is formed. However, there
is not much energy difference between the compared al-
ternative configurations. Accordingly, the orientations of
the cation molecules may be sensitive to heat.
In the SbH4-based perovskites, SbH4PbBr2I displays
lattice constants of a = 5.883 ˚A, b = 5.936 ˚A, and
c = 6.287 ˚A, while SbH4PbBrI2 shows a modest expan-
sion to a = 5.879 ˚A, b = 6.310 ˚A, and c = 6.311 ˚A, partic-
ularly along the b- and c-axes. Correspondingly, the Pb–I
bond length in SbH4PbBr2I (3.15 ˚A) increases slightly to
3.17 ˚A in SbH4PbBrI2, whereas the Pb–Br bond length
decreases from 2.97 ˚A to 2.93 ˚A. The hydrogen bond-
ing environment is altered as well, with SbH4PbBr2I
exhibiting H–I and H–Br bond lengths of 2.86 ˚A and
2.82 ˚A, respectively, and SbH4PbBrI2 showing an H–I
bond length of 2.88 ˚A. Moreover, a direct comparison
between MAPbBrI2 and SbH4PbBrI2 highlights the im-
pact of A-site cation substitution: the replacement of the
bulky organic MA+ cation with the more compact SbH+
4
cation results in a slight contraction of the lattice and
in shorter Pb–halide bonds.
The hydrogen bonding is
also distinctly modified, with MAPbBrI2 showing an H–
I bond of 2.64 ˚A and lacking an H–Br bond, whereas in
SbH4PbBrI2 the H–I bond length is increased to 2.88 ˚A.
These observations suggest that the introduction of the
inorganic SbH+
4 cation yields a denser and more rigid
perovskite framework, which may enhance the material’s
thermal and chemical stability.
Crossing over to the electronic characteristics, Br−
substitution by I−fundamentally affects the band struc-
ture. The comparative DOS pattern of the MAPbBrI2
and SbH4PbBrI2 lattices is provided in Figure 11, and
their corresponding electronic band structure is presented
in Figure 12. For the MA-based perovskites, the VBM
of MAPbBr2I is 2.5681 eV and that of the CBM is
4.2807 eV, resulting in a band gap of 1.7126 eV. For
MAPbBrI2, the VBM turns out to be 2.3287 eV and the
CBM turns out to be 3.9798 eV, resulting in the band gap
further reducing to 1.6511 eV (Table II). This narrowing
of band gap is primarily caused by lower electronegativity
and higher ionic radius of iodine, which result in shift-
ing of the energy levels and allow greater absorption of
light in longer wavelength region. In addition, carrier dy-
namics of charges are modified; MAPbBr2I possesses an
effective mass of a hole and electron of 0.170 and 0.194,
whereas those of MAPbBrI2 are up to 0.239 and 0.198,
meaning electron mobility can have a decrease.
In SbH4-based perovskites, the trend is the same.
