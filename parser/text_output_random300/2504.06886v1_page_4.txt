The variance of temperature fluctuations, c2, is in-
versely proportional to the variance of entropy fluctu-
ations, i.e., the heat capacity χ2, as demonstrated in
Figure 1.
We observe that c2 decreases with increas-
ing temperature, reflecting the opposite trend of χ2 as
shown in the supplement. This behavior indicates a sig-
nificant suppression of temperature fluctuations in QGP
phase compared to those in HRG phase. The suppres-
sion is more remarkable for high-order temperature fluc-
tuations, as evident in Figure 2 (Note the logarithmic
y-axis). A direct consequence of the suppression of tem-
perature fluctuations at high temperature is that the dis-
tribution of temperature is wider in the region of lower
temperature, that implies a negative skewness, as con-
firmed in the top-left panel of Figure 2. While the kur-
tosis remains positive in most cases, its sign may reverse
near the chiral crossover as it is sharpened continuously
with the increase of baryon chemical potential. The sign
change is more prominent for the hyper-order c5 and c6
cumulants.
In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the event-averaged
mean transverse momentum ⟨pT ⟩of charged particles ex-
hibits an approximate linear dependence on the system
temperature, ⟨pT ⟩= a T [52]. The parameter a repre-
sents the proportionality coefficient. In order to elimi-
nate the influence from this coefficient that is not deter-
mined quite well, we instead analyze dimensionless ratios
of temperature fluctuation cumulants:

where the powers of the variance in the denominators are
chosen to balance the powers of T as shown in Eqs. (9)
and (10). The relevant ratios, presented in Figure 3, re-
veal that the cumulant ratios develop an increasingly rich
nonmonotonic structure while exhibiting systematically
reduced amplitudes with the increase of µB, reflecting
competing effects where enhanced critical fluctuations
near the sharpened phase boundary emerge concurrently
with the overall suppression of the magnitude of temper-
ature fluctuation, as evidenced by the behavior shown in
Figures 1 and 2.
Conclusions.
We have studied temperature fluctua-
tions in hot QCD matter through a newly introduced
thermodynamic state function that directly connects to
mean transverse momentum fluctuations measured in
heavy-ion collisions.
Our approach yields analytic ex-
pressions for arbitrary-order temperature fluctuations,
revealing their fundamental relationship with entropy,
heat capacity, and high-order entropy fluctuations. Im-
plementing this in a 2+1 flavor LEFT-fRG framework, we
firstly achieve obtaining numerical results that quantify
