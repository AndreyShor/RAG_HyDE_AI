FIG. 4. Probability density of the lowest-energy eigenstate calculated numerically from a discretized version of Eq. (8). In
all cases, we find that hinge states (blue) propagate along closed paths of hinges consistent with the dimerization patterns
and boundary terminations discussed in the main text.
(a) When tz1 = 0.7µ > ˜tz¯1 = 0.22µ, the hinge state follows the
path shown in Fig. 3(a). (b) When tz1 = 0.22µ < ˜tz¯1 = 0.7µ, we find ourselves in the situation illustrated in Fig. 3(b). (c)
Changing the boundary termination by removing the last QAH layer leads to the relocation of one hinge state propagating
along the x direction from the m = Ny plane to the m = 1 plane. The hinge states propagating along the other directions
adjust accordingly to create a closed hinge path in accordance with the dimerization pattern set by the parameter hierarchy
tz1 = 0.7µ > ˜tz¯1 = 0.22µ. (d) The same as in (c) but with tz1 = 0.22µ < ˜tz¯1 = 0.7µ. (e) The same as in (c) but with
swapped values of the z-tunneling amplitudes in the middle of the wires such that tz1 = 0.7µ, ˜tz¯1 = 0.22µ for x ∈[0, lx/2], and
tz1 = 0.22µ, ˜tz¯1 = 0.7µ for x ∈(lx/2, lx]. The numerical parameters are ∆B = 0.8µ, ty = 0.6µ, and tz¯1 = ˜tz1 = 0. The size of
the sample is Ny × Nz = 20 × 20 unit cells, and the length of the wires is kF lx ≈56.
the lowest-energy eigenstate obtained from a discretized
version of our 3D coupled-wires model for two different
values of tunneling amplitudes tz1, ˜tz¯1. In both cases, we
find that the lowest-energy state is indeed tightly local-
ized to the set of hinges highlighted in Fig. 3.
The path of the hinge states also depends on the
boundary termination. To see this, we change the bound-
ary by removing the last 2D layer lying in the xy plane
at n = Nz, τ = ¯1.
From Fig. 2, it becomes clear
that this modification causes one hinge state propagat-
ing along the x direction to relocate from the wire with
(n, m, τ, ν) = (Nz, Ny, ¯1, 1) to the wire with (Nz, 1, 1, ¯1).
As a consequence, the hinge states in the other directions
adjust accordingly to create a closed hinge path in accor-
dance with the corresponding dimerization pattern. see
Figs. 4(c) and 4(d).
Furthermore, we can obtain a more peculiar hinge
path, shown in Fig. 4(e), by swapping the values of the
tunneling amplitudes in the z direction, tz1 and ˜tz¯1, at
some point along the wires.
For example, in the nu-
merical calculations we swapped the amplitudes in the
middle of the wires and used the values tz1 = 0.7µ,
˜tz¯1 = 0.22µ for x ∈[0, lx/2], and tz1 = 0.22µ, ˜tz¯1 = 0.7µ
for x ∈(lx/2, lx], where lx is the length of the wires.
Although this case is rather artificial, we present it to
emphasize the flexibility of our model in realizing various
hinge paths by a simple adjustment of the system param-
eters. For completeness, we demonstrate other possible
paths corresponding to different dimerization patterns
and boundary terminations in systems with swapped z-
tunneling amplitudes in Appendix B.
Finally, we can also calculate the energy spectrum as
a function of momentum kx, ky, or kz assuming the sys-
tem is infinite along the x, y, or z direction, respectively.
Here, we focus on the situation shown in Fig. 4(a), but
the other cases can be considered in the same way. The
resulting energy spectra are shown in Figs. 5(a)–5(c), and

FIG. 5. (a)–(c) Numerically calculated low-energy spectrum
as a function of kx, ky, or kz for a system that is infinite
along the x, y, or z direction, respectively, in the parameter
regime corresponding to Fig. 4(a). We see that gapless states
are present in all three cases. (d)–(f) Probability density of
the lowest-energy in-gap states Ri (Li) propagating to the
right (left) along the axis i = {x, y, z}. These states are also
highlighted by blue (orange) points in (a)–(c). The insets in
(d) show a zoomed-in plot. Upon mapping the 2D probability
densities shown here back onto a 3D sample, one recovers the
hinge path shown in Fig. 3(a). The numerical parameters are
the same as in Fig. 4(a).
