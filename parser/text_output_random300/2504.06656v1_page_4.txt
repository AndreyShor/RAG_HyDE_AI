To explore the possible scenarios for detection of the

the production cross-section of three benchmark pointsﬁgure.2 shows the cross-section for BP1,
BP2 and BP3. It is clear that at lower energy the cross-section is higher, but as the energy goes
on increasing, the production cross-section decreases. The cross-section is produced at centre of

use 2HDMC 1.8.0 (Two Higgs Doublet Model Calculator) [9] and Gnuplot [10] is used for plotting
graphs of cross-section and branching ratio. In BP1 the branching ratio BR(H+ −→τντ) has
a value of 4.62067338−3 at mass MH±=100 GeV and at the mass, MH± = 190 GeV the value of
branching ratio drops to 1.79110173e −04. For BR(H+ −→W +h0) the branching ratio gives
value 1.42079956 × 10−7 at MH± = 130 GeV and increases at MH± = 190 GeV to a value of
1.34287237 × 10−3. The branching ratio for BP2 for BR(H+ −→τντ) at MH± = 100 GeV is
2.90635149 × 10−4 and drops its value 1.15557745 × 10−5 at MH± = 190 GeV .
For BP3 the
branching ratio is higher BR(H+ −→τντ) as at lower tanβ the leptonic decay dominates so at
