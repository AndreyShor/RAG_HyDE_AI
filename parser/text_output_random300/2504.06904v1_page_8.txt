Minimizing the transmission time of information to 
dispatcher control centers is crucial. Therefore, the 
adopted value of t1= 300 seconds ensures the safe 
operation of gas pipelines. On the other hand, the p(t) 
function takes different values depending on the 
dependence on θ, which determines the location of the 
leakage. Specifically, when θ > 0.5, the p(t) function 
takes its minimum value (3rd line in Figure 6), while for 
θ < 0.5, the p(t) function takes its maximum value (1st 
line in Figure 6). However, when θ is approximately 
equal to 0.5, p(t) approaches 1, indicating a scenario 
where the leakage point is in the middle section of the 
pipeline

The analysis of the figure leads to the following 
conclusion: when p(t) belongs to the interval [0;1], it 
characterizes the location of gas pipeline rupture

Clearly, these simple and understandable pieces of 
information are very important for the gas emergency 
control center. Based on the analysis conducted, it was 
determined that the fixation period t=t1 remains constant 
regardless of the location of accidents on the pipeline. To 
determine whether this time remains constant or varies 
depending on the parameters of the pipeline, we consider 
different parallel gas pipelines with the following 
parameters particular importance. 
 P1=14×104 Pa; P2 =11×104 Pa; G0= 10 Pa×sec/m;

It is evident from the given information that the length 
of the newly adopted parallel gas pipeline is at least 3 
times shorter than the length of the previously analyzed 
gas pipeline, and also that the values of other parameters 
(pressure and consumption) are different. We consider 
the length of the examined complex parallel pipeline at 
three characteristic points where the gas leakage occurs, 
similar to the previous pipeline: near the beginning of the 
pipeline

We use Equations (3) and (4) to calculate the pressure 
values of the gas pipeline's beginning and end sections 
every 60 seconds for each of the three characteristic 
points where the gas leakage occurs. The results are 
recorded in Table 2.

Using the data from Table 2, we plot the variation of 
p(t) as a function of time for each of the three 
characteristic points (Figure 7). From the analysis of 
Figure 7, it can be noted that the variation of pressure 
over time in the outer sections depending on the location 
of the gas pipeline's leakage is similar to that observed in 
Figure 6.
