ON THE STRUCTURE OF DHR BIMODULES OF ABSTRACT SPIN
CHAINS
LUCAS HATAISHI, DAVID JAKLITSCH, COREY JONES, AND MAKOTO YAMASHITA
Abstract. Abstract spin chains axiomatize the structure of local observables on the 1D lattice
which are invariant under a global symmetry, and arise at the physical boundary of 2+1D
topologically ordered spin systems. In this paper, we study tensor categorical properties of
DHR bimodules over abstract spin chains. Assuming that the charge transporters generate the
algebra of observables, we prove that the associated category has a structure of modular tensor
category with respect to the natural braiding. Under an additional assumption of algebraic
Haag duality, this category becomes the Drinfeld center of the half-line fusion category.

1. Introduction
The theory of quantum spin chains provides an intriguing manifestation of discrete quantum
ﬁeld theory, where ideas from the theory of quantum integrable systems, special functions, and
operator algebras meet.
In this context, the algebra of local observables is modeled by the
tensor product of matrix algebras, which model a locally ﬁnite-dimensional 1D algebraic quan-
tum ﬁeld theory, but without a designated choice of Hilbert space representation or symmetry
