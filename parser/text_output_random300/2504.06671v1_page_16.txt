4H-SiC. (c) The three distinct axial NV centers in 6H-SiC. (purple and black spheres represent Si 
and C atoms, respectively). Figure taken from  Ref. [71]. 
 
Wang et al. [72 ] employed nitrogen ion implantation with an incident energy of 30 keV to introduce NV 
centers in 4H-SiC. To optimize the formation of divacancies, they systematically varied the annealing 
temperature from 800°C to 1050°C. Their study successfully demonstrated coherent control of NV center 
spins and characterized the fluorescence and ODMR properties of single NV centers in 4H-SiC at room 
temperature. By refining the annealing conditions, they achieved a significant increase in NV center 
concentration. Jian et al. [73] utilized high-energy (12 MeV) proton irradiation to generate NV centers in 
4H-SiC. The irradiated samples were subsequently annealed at elevated temperatures, leading to the 
formation of NV centers with an estimated concentration of approximately 1016cm−3. Bardeleben et al. 
[74] investigated the creation of NV centers across multiple SiC polytypes (3C, 4H, and 6H-SiC) using high-
energy electron irradiation followed by post-irradiation annealing. Their study provided valuable insights 
into the defect formation processes and the impact of different irradiation methods on NV center 
generation in SiC.  
The summary of the main experimental methods used for creating divacancies and NV centers in SiC is 
given in Table 4.
