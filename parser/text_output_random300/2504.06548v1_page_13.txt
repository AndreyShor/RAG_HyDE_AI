Q ˙z+kz = Fts +F0cos(ωt),
(15)
where F0 is the amplitude of the driving force, Q is the quality
factor of the free cantilever. Fts contains the tip–surface inter-
action forces. In the absence of tip–surface forces, Fts = 0, the
above equation represents the forced harmonic oscillator with
damping. The quality factor Q is related to the damping factor
γ as
Q = mω0
2γ ,
(16)
where γ introduces the influence of the environmental
medium, which could be ambient air, liquid or ultrahigh vac-
uum (UHV).
The steady state solution for the forced oscillator [Eq. (15)]
is
z(t) = z0 +Acos(ωt +α).
(17)
The dependence of the amplitude with the excitation fre-
quency is given by
A =
F0
m[(ω2
0 −ω2)2 +( ωω0
Q )2]
(18)
and the phase in free space is given by138,139
tanα0(ω) =
ωω0
Q(ω2
0 −ω2).
(19)
The above expressions can be simplified by oscillating the
probe at ω = ω0 and the phase α0 becomes
α0(ω0) = π

(20)
The introduction of tip-sample interactions (Fts) changes the
oscillation, thereby modifying the system’s response.
For
small displacements (z) with respect to the rest position (z0)
of the cantilever, the force can be written as follows after a
Taylor expansion:
Fts ≈dFts(z)
dz
|z=z0z(t).
(21)
Thus, the equation of motion [Eq. (15)] becomes
F0cos(ωt) = m¨z+ mω0
Q ˙z+[(k −dFts(z)
dz
)z(t)].
(22)
Here, a number of forces can be acting between the tip and
the sample simultaneously, such as van der Waals, magneto-
static and electrostatic interactions. F0 describes the ampli-
tude of the driving force and mω0
Q
is the damping factor. The
phase shift in the presence of dFts
dz is given by
tanα(ω) =
mωω0
Q(k + dFts
dz −mω2)
.
(23)
If the probe oscillates at ω0 and dFts
dz ≪k, Eq. (14) can be
substituted into Eq. (22). For a given value of k we find with
dFts
dz , the phase to be
tanα(ω0) =
k
Q dFts
dz
.
(24)
The shift in the phase at the resonance frequency is given
by
∆α = α0(ω0)−α(ω0)
(25)
Combining Eqs. (20) and (24) finally provides the expres-
sion for the phase shift as
∆α = π
2 −tan−1(

The frequency-modulated modes in MFM and other scan-
ning probe techniques utilize frequency shifts to capture mag-
netic contrast in MFM images140. From Eq. (21), the effective
spring constant of the cantilever (kef f ) can be defined as
kef f = k −dFts
dz |z=z0.
(27)
The above equation leads to a softer cantilever if the force
gradient is positive and a harder cantilever for the negative
force gradient137. The modified frequency ω

The above equation shows that the resonance frequency of
a weakly perturbed harmonic oscillator is related to the gra-
dient of the interaction. A change in the effective resonance
frequency will alter the probe’s oscillation amplitude accord-
ing to Eq. (18). The amplitude’s dependence on the excitation
and effective resonance frequency suggests a potential mech-
anism for elucidating how the oscillation amplitude is influ-
enced by the strength of the interaction force, which can also
be interpreted in terms of tip-sample separation.
The most common method to excite AFM cantilevers in-
volves oscillating the chip holding cantilever using a piezo-
electric transducer. However, this method is not particularly
