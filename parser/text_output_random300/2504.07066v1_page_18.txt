flow, we identify 2M-WS2 and Sr3SnO as experimentally
viable platforms for realizing and probing vortex and
junction Majorana physics.
Our analysis of 2M-WS2 highlights the importance,
and in some cases the necessity, of exploring VLT transi-
tions at the ab initio level. While effective theories such
as the Fu-Kane model provide valuable conceptual guid-
ance, they can overlook essential physics, particularly in
multi-band superconductors like 2M-WS2. In this sys-
tem, the Fu-Kane paradigm successfully captures VLT
behavior arising from the Z2 topological bands near the Γ
point. However, relying solely on this picture to construct
a Γ-centered effective model will lead to a qualitatively
incorrect VLT phase diagram. In particular, such an ap-
proach would entirely miss the additional VLT transition
near µ ∼−25 meV, which originates from the Lifshitz
transition at L. While first-principles vortex simulations
remain computationally demanding, our JVC framework
offers a powerful and efficient alternative to fill in this
crucial gap.
Building on these findings, a promising future direc-
tion is to apply our ab initio π-junction framework to
other superconductors where vortex zero-bias peaks have
been experimentally reported, such as Fe(Te,Se) [14],
LiFeAs [21], and PbTaSe2 [81].
This approach could
play a pivotal role in addressing ongoing controversies
surrounding the Majorana nature of these systems. For
materials found to lack topological vortex states at their
native chemical potential, our phase diagram construc-
tion provides a clear roadmap for Fermi-level engineer-
ing to induce vortex MZMs, offering critical guidance for
future experimental efforts. Although not the primary
focus of this work, our framework for Josephson topol-
ogy, especially its ab initio implementation, also serves
as a powerful screening tool for identifying superconduc-
tors suitable for Josephson-junction-based devices with
nontrivial topological functionalities. For example, a su-
perconductor exhibiting second-order Josephson topol-
ogy is guaranteed to host Majorana corner modes at its
π-junction [82], providing a natural platform for topolog-
ical qubits. Moreover, the concept of Josephson topology
can be readily extended to superconductors of different
dimensionalities or symmetry classes. We leave these in-
triguing directions for future work.
