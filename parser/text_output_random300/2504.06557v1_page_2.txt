Abstract 
 Reducing wealth inequality is a global challenge, and the problems of 
capitalism stem from the enclosure of the commons and the breakdown of the 
community. According to previous studies by Polanyi, Karatani, and Graeber, 
economic modes can be divided into capitalist market economy (enclosure and 
exchange), power economy (de-enclosure and redistribution), gift economy (obligation 
to return and reciprocity), and concession economy (de-obligation to return). The 
concession economy reflects Graeber’s baseline communism (from each according to 
their abilities, to each according to their needs) and Deguchi’s We-turn philosophy (the 
“I” as an individual has a “fundamental incapability” and the subject of physical action, 
responsibility, and freedom is “We” as a multi-agent system, including the “I”). In this 
study, we constructed novel network models for these four modes and compared their 
properties (cluster coefficient, graph density, reciprocity, assortativity, centrality, and 
Gini coefficient). From the calculation results, it became clear that the market economy 
leads to inequality; the power economy mitigates inequality but cannot eliminate it; the 
gift and concession economies lead to a healthy and equal economy; and the concession 
economy, free from the ties of obligation to return, is possible without guaranteeing 
reciprocity. We intend to promote the transformation from a capitalist economy to a 
concession economy through activities that disseminate baseline communism and the 
We-turn philosophy that promotes concession, that is, developing a cooperative 
platform to support concession through information technology and empirical research 
through fieldwork.
