fewer than 20 pages. The first requirement is a consequence of how our connection
to the COMSOL Multiphysics®sandbox is set up, and to make the problem easier
for the models to attempt to solve. We additionally ensured that the problems were
amenable to computing a numerical artifact.
3. Solving Speed: We also excluded any problems whose ground truth code took over
a minute to solve.

Generation Procedure:
Without any modification, the tutorials might export a single value, a table, or not export
any target quantity at all, with the final output being qualitative in nature, such as in the
form of plots or figures. For our benchmark, however, we specifically wanted every problem
to have a numerically verifiable target value, in order for there to be an absolute notion of
correctness (i.e. if the code was fully correct, and aligned with the intent of the problem,
it should be able to export this value). This also enables easier evaluation of the problems.
The following procedure and guidelines were adopted to curate the benchmark:
• For an initial set of 2-3 problems, model specifications and plans were annotated by
hand, by an expert user of COMSOL Multiphysics®.
• For subsequent problems, we speed up the benchmark generation procedure by
following an initial LLM-assisted data generation process, with the final verification
steps involving humans. An LLM is provided with a tutorial, as well as a two-shot
prompt with the expert annotated model specifications.
• The LLM is entasked with returning a model specification for the tutorial that has
the same format. This requires the LLM to identify an appropriate target value from
the tutorial which it does from either the text or the figures, and returning a model
specification for computing this target value.
• The LLM is then asked to create a plan corresponding to the model specifications,
using a two-shot prompt with two plans. The utility of the tutorials are that the plan
is closest to the GUI instructions listed in the tutorial, while model specifications is
more concise.
• A ground truth code that can compute the correct value is then generated for
the problem. We manually verify that the ground code when run, exports the
desired target value. This step also involves simultaneously ensuring that all
information required to build the model is contained in the plan, and in the model
specifications by editing the LLM-generated drafts and ensuring that no Translation
Errors are encountered when parsing and executing the ground truth code in
COMSOL Multiphysics®using the bridge described in Appendix D.1 or that any
errors if encountered are in non-crucial lines and do not prevent the solution
from being computed. Any missing or incorrect information is fixed, and the
selection information field, that contains numerical identities of boundaries and
points is also created.
• We add an instruction to export the output to OUTPUT PATH/output.txt in the model
specifications and plan.
