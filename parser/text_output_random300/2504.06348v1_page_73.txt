E.2.3
SELT
We compute the quantity |kp|2 (and likewise |kP|2) once to an ancilla register, to be shared across both the
kinetic and interaction terms (for the latter, see App. E.5.4). The cost of this preparation is included in the
interaction term. Given the preparation of a uniform reference state in App. E.2.2, SELT then reduces to
a single inequality test as discussed in Sec. 5.1.2. The register encoding |kP|2 (and |kp|2) is of size ¯b and b,
respectively, hence the cost is b + ¯b Toffolis.

We aim to prepare a state |ϕV ⟩(where we drop the superscript PI for brevity on the ion charges ZI), defined
as
|ϕV ⟩∝

To prepare |ϕV ⟩(up to entanglement with junk), we first prepare a state

For atomic numbers ZI let κ = ηval + Pηion

Z¯I =

¯I = 1, .., ηval,
Z¯I−ηval
¯I = ηval + 1, ..., ηval + ηion.

Note that κ = 2ηval for charge-neutral systems. Then we (i) first prepare a uniform superposition over
values z = 1 . . . κ (with cost 2⌈log κ⌉+ 2bκ −8); (ii) using a QROM, load ¯I for all Z¯I−1 < z ≤Z¯I. This
generates the state we want, up to entanglement with junk. To see this note that the state after the USP is
transformed to

But ¯I(z) is a constant for all Z¯I−1 < z ≤Z¯I, and so rearranging and dropping the z argument gives

Of course, it would be unnecessarily costly to use a QROM that indexes over all values z = 1 . . . κ with
cost κ given that the majority of the loaded values are just equal to the index itself (because Z¯I = 1 provided
that ¯I ≤ηval). Instead, we (i) copy the index value to the output register using CNOTs (with zero cost); (ii)
subtract ηval from the index register (with cost ⌈log η⌉−2); (iii) use a QROM over κ −ηval indices to fix up
the incorrect values by loading z ⊕¯I(z) (with cost κ −ηval); (iv) add ηval back into the index register (with
cost ⌈log η⌉−2). The total cost of this part is then κ −ηval + 2⌈log η⌉−4. Note that this must be repeated
twice: once for ¯I and once for ¯J.
The simplest way to add a control to the preparation of |ϕV ⟩for the term selection in Eq. (81) is to
control the QROM here. In the case where the control is off and the QROM is not applied, the |¯I⟩register
