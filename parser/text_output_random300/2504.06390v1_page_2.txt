Abstract
Polarons are the primary charge carriers in organic materials. A deep understanding of
their properties can open channels for novel optoelectronic applications. By applying
electric and magnetic fields, we investigate the influence of polaron interactions on the
linear and nonlinear optical properties of a graphene monolayer between a substrate
and air. Using the density matrix approach, we derive the linear and nonlinear optical
absorption coefficients and the relative refractive index by incorporating the zero-energy
level. Our numerical results reveal that the polaron effect and the magnetic field induce
shifts in the peak positions of the optical absorption coefficients and refractive index.
Moreover, while the presence of electric and magnetic fields significantly alters the
amplitude of the absorption coefficients, only the magnetic field affects the refractive
index amplitude. Additionally, we find that the magnetic field amplifies the influence of
surface optical phonons on the optical properties of graphene. These findings provide
deeper insights into the optical behavior of graphene in external fields, which could be
relevant for optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
Graphene, a two-dimensional material, exhibits exceptional nonlinear optical properties due
to its unique band structure and interband optical transitions across a wide range of photon
energies.1–3 A key feature of graphene in a magnetic field is its unconventional Landau levels.4
The valence and conduction bands meet at the zero Landau level, allowing electrons and holes
to coexist without an energy gap.5,6 Various methods7–16 have been proposed to induce an
energy gap at this level, including the interaction between graphene’s charge carriers and
the vibration modes of a polar substrate.6 These interactions modify the material’s linear
dispersion, opening the gap due to the polaron effect.6 Experimental studies using magneto-
optical spectroscopy17 have confirmed the emergence of such an energy gap in graphene when
placed on a substrate.
