The oscillatory behavior of the modes is determined by the quantities KL,R. For KL,R = 0, one has κL,R = 0, respectively,
which mandates that the modes decay exponentially for x →∓∞, respectively. Conversely, for KL,R ̸= 0, one has κL,R ̸= 0,
respectively, which mandates modes with exponentially damped oscillations for x →∓∞, respectively. In summary, one has
(
KL,R = 0 →exp. decay
KL,R ̸= 0 →exp. damped oscill.
for x →∓∞

Reality
Note also that, in the hermitian case Im(m(x)) = Im(v(x)) = 0, the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation is real, and consequently,
all solutions are real for some choices of A1,2. In the nonhermitian case when Im(m(x)) ̸= 0 or Im(v(x)) ̸= 0 instead, it is not
possible to choose A1,2 such that the solutions are real: In other words, the solutions are complex for all choices of A1,2. This
also mandates that the complex phase of the wavefunction is not uniform in the nonhermitian case.

Length scales and hairstyles
As we have shown, the existence and number of zero modes and their pseudospin in the infinite interval −∞< x < ∞only
depend on the topological mass ML,R and topological invariants WL,R, i.e., on the values of the fields mL,R and vL,R at large
distances |x| > w, with their pseudospin determined only by WL,R. These modes are localized at the smooth domain wall, and
their number coincides with the difference between the topological invariants on the left and right sides |WR −WL|. Analogously,
the existence of a zero mode in the semi-infinite interval 0 ≤x < ∞only depends on the mass term MR and topological invariant
WR, i.e., on the values of the fields mR and vR at x > w, with its pseudospin determined only by WR. This mode is localized at
an infinite wall at x = 0, when the topological invariant on the right side is nontrivial |WR| = 1. These results generalize the
bulk-boundary correspondence [6–8] nonhermitian systems. On the other hand, the quantities WL,R in Eq. (11c) generalize the
topological invariants to nonhermitian systems.
At large distances x/w →±∞, the asymptotic behavior of each mode in Eq. (8) is determined only by the associated decay
rates µ±
L,R and momenta κ±
L,R or, alternatively, by the characteristic decay lengths ξ±
L,R and oscillation wavelengths λ±
L,R for each
asymptote and for each mode, describing the exponential decay or exponentially damped oscillations, which ultimately depend
only on the values of the fields mL,R and vL,R at large distances |x| ≫w. On the left asymptote, the case KL = 0 mandates
κ±
L = 0 (i.e., λ±
L = ∞), which corresponds to an exponential decay (without oscillations), while the case KL ̸= 0 mandates
κ±
L ̸= 0 (i.e., λ±
L < ∞) which correspond to exponentially damped oscillations. If Im(mL) = Im(vL) = 0, the case KL = 0
is realized for v2
L + mL ≥0 (exponential decay) while the case KL ̸= 0 is realized for v2
L + mL < 0 (exponentially damped
oscillations). Moreover, one has that µ+
L = µ−
L if Re(qL) = 0, and κ+
L = −κ−
L if Im(vL) = 0. Analogous statements hold for
the right asymptote.
At short distances |x| ≲w instead, the modes cannot be fully described only by the characteristic lengths ξ±
L,R, λ±
L,R (or by the
complex numbers α±
L,R). This is because, at short distances, the wavefunctions of the zero modes also depend on the width of the
smooth domain wall w and on the details of the spatial dependences of the fields. For instance, the wavefunctions of the zero
modes in Eq. (7) depend on the value mD = m(0), which is not fully determined by the asymptotic values mL,R.
In the case of a sharp domain wall w →0, the zero modes are only characterized by the lengths ξR, λR (alternatively, by one
complex number αR) on the right of the domain wall x > 0, and by another set of characteristic lengths ξL, λL (or alternatively,
by one complex number αL) on the left of the domain wall x < 0. These zero modes localized at sharp phase boundaries are
featureless objects with "no hair", using the terminology introduced in Ref. 26. Likewise, zero modes localized at a smooth
domain wall have "hair", i.e., they are nonfeatureless, since they cannot be described entirely by a small set of numbers at all
length scales. We distinguish the cases of zero modes with "short hair" when w < ξ and with "long hair" when w > ξ. Zero modes
with short hair appear featureless at large distances |x| > ξ > w but not at small distances |x| < w, where their wavefunctions
crucially depend on the detail of the fields near the domain wall. Zero modes with long hair have instead wavefunctions that are
nonfeatureless at all length scales and crucially depend on the detail of the fields. Notice also that the property of having short or
long hair depends on the side considered since a zero mode can have short hair on the left x < 0 and long hair on the right of the
domain wall x > 0, or viceversa. The existence of zero modes localized at smooth domain walls is still a direct consequence of
the bulk-boundary correspondence in the hermitian regime and of the generalized form of the bulk-boundary correspondence (in
the language of the generalized invariant in Eq. (11c)) in the nonhermitian regime.
