the cup product of Φ([g(z)]) ∈Ca(U|X, ∧aTX) and Φ([h(z)]) ∈Cb(U|X, ∧bTX) is given by

Therefore we have Φ([g] · [h]) = Φ([g]) · Φ([h]), which ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem 3.1.
□
Proof of Proposition 2.8. The proof amounts to careful application of results of Villaﬂor [12].
For f ∈S = C[z], we deﬁne an ideal J0(f) := ⟨z1f1, · · · , zmfm, · · · , zrfr⟩of S and set R0(f) :=
S/J0(f).
Let ρi1, · · · , ρim be linearly independent primitive generators of the rays of Σ. Then for I = {i1, · · · , im},
[12, Section 6] gives a deﬁnition of the toric Hessian of f as
HessΣ(f) := HessI
Σ(f)
det(ρI)
∈R0(f)mβ,
(3.3)
which turns out to be independent of the choice of I. Since dimC R0(f)mβ = 1 and HessΣ(f) is non-zero
by [12, Proposition 3.3, Corollary 6.1], for V ∈R0(f)mβ, there is a unique number cV ∈C such that
V ≡cV · HessΣ(V )
mod J0(f).
Motivated by [12, Corollary 6.1], we deﬁne the LG trace pairing TrLG : R(f)(m−1)β →C by
TrLG(U) := −(2πi)m−1(−1)
m(m−1)
2
cz1···zrU · m! · Vol(∆),
(3.4)
where ∆is the convex polyhedron associated to the anti-canonical divisor β.
Here we used that if
U ∈S(m−1)β, then z1 · · · zrU ∈Smβ and that z1 · · · zrJ(f)(m−1)β ⊂J0(f)mβ holds.
Now let us calculate the cup product in ˇCech cohomology
Ca(U|X, ˆΩb
X) × Cb(U|X, ˆΩa
X) →Cm−1(U|X, ˆΩm−1

a + b = m −1.
By Theorem 3.5, we have

for u(z) ∈R(f)aβ. Then for u(z) ∈R(f)aβ and v(z) ∈R(f)bβ (with a + b = m −1), the cup product is
given by
φΩ([u(z)]) ∪φΩ([v(z)])

where the sign (−1)a2 arises from (3.2) and the multi-index L is partitioned to
L = (r0, · · · , ra−1, s, t1, · · · , tb),
R = (r0, · · · , ra−1),
T = (t1, · · · , tb).
Note that dimC R(f)(m−1)β = 1 and u(z)v(z) ∈R(f)(m−1)β.
Since one can show ΩRs ∧ΩsT =
det(ρL)c
zLΩs from (2.3), we have

We recall the reside map res of the Poincar´e regular sequence in [12, Deﬁnition 10.1] and the coboundary
