6. Calculation of Material Properties 
There is a consensus that the effective attenuation length (EAL) 𝐿 is better suited for quantitative XPS analyses than 
the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) 𝜆, because it also takes the inelastic scattering into account. Therefore, only EALs 
were used in the paper. The calculation of both variables is shown below for comparison. The equations are plotted 
in Figure S4.  
The IMFPs, which were not used in the paper, can be calculated by the predictive TPP-2M formula, proposed by 
Tanuma, Powell, and Penn:[4] 
𝜆=

𝐸𝑝2 [𝛽 ln(𝛾𝐸𝑘) −ln(𝐶/𝐸𝑘) + (𝐷/𝐸𝑘

Here, 𝐸𝑘 is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron in eV, 𝐸𝑝 is the free electron plasmon energy in eV, 𝑁𝑣 is the 
number of valence electrons per atom or molecule, 𝜌 is the density in g cm−3, 𝑀 is the atomic or molecular weight 
and 𝐸𝑔 is the band gap in eV. Table S4 shows the values used to calculate the IMFPs using eq. S4-S9 for SnTe and SnO. 
Just for comparison, we also applied the so-called universal curve for IMFP in inorganic compounds, as proposed by 
Seah and Dench:[5] 
𝜆= 641

The EALs were calculated by a universal curve proposed by Seah:[6]

corresponding atomic numbers 𝑍𝑔 and 𝑍ℎ. 𝐸𝑔 is the band gap in eV, 𝐸𝑘 the kinetic energy of the photoelectron in eV 
and 𝑎 the thickness per monolayer in nm:[6]

Thereby, 𝑀 is the molar mass, 𝜌 the mass density and 𝑁𝐴 the Avogadro constant. The material parameters that were 
used in the calculation of the IMFPs and EALs are given in Table S4.
