Here,
εα is the quasi-energy.
So the Hamilto-
nian can be represented as a diagonal matrix H(t) =
P
n hn(t)|n⟩⟨n| under the Fock basis {|n⟩} , with ma-
trix elements of hn(t) = n (ω0 + A cos Ωt).
Thus, the
Schr¨odinger equation can be simplified as
i∂tψn(t) = n (ω0 + A cos Ωt) ψn(t),
(4)
here ψn(t) = ⟨n | ψ, t⟩. Combined with Eq. 3, the steady-
state solution can be expressed as
|ψn, t⟩= e−inω0t |un, t⟩,
|un, t⟩= e−inΩA sin Ωt|n⟩.
(5)
We define |unm, t⟩= |un, t⟩eimΩt = unm(t)|n⟩,with
unm(t) = e−inΩA sin ΩteimΩt, which satisfies
HF |unm, t⟩= εnm |unm, t⟩.
(6)
At this point, we have identified Brillouin regions over
the frequency domain, where the single Brillouin region
have a width of Ω, and the different Brillouin regions are
represented by the index m, called the Floquet index.
And where HF = H(t) −i∂t is called the Floquet Hamil-
tonian, |unm, t⟩is the time-periodic Floquet state, and
quasi-energy εnm = nω0 + mΩ. The |un, t⟩can also be
written as |un0, t⟩. Under the complete base vector set
{|nmn⟩⟩} with |nm⟩= |n⟩eimΩt , the matrix elements of
the Floquet Hamiltonian are
⟨⟨nm| HF | n′
m′⟩⟩= ⟨n|H[m−m′] |n′⟩+ m′Ωδmm′δnn′,
(7)
where H[l] is the Fourier component of H(t) . Since
H(t) =

n (ω0 + A cos Ωt) |n⟩⟨n|

where H[0] = P

2 |n⟩⟨n| , and
H[l] = 0 for |l| > 1 . Thus, the Eq. 7 can be further
expressed as

Obviously, HF is a block diagonal form about n, and
we write the projection of HF in subspace {|nm⟩⟩} with
fixed n as H(n)

which satisfies H(n)
F
|unm⟩⟩= εnm |unm⟩⟩according to
the Eq. 6. It can be observed that each Fock state en-
ergy level splits into 2m + 1 sublevels, consistent with
the periodic nature of the Floquet Hamiltonian.
The
off-diagonal elements, proportional to A/2, characterize
the coupling strength between adjacent Floquet states,
thereby determining the transition rates between differ-
ent energy levels. This coupling reflects the influence of
the periodic driving field and results in transitions medi-
ated by the exchange of discrete energy quanta of size Ω.

Self-induced oscillation by blue-detuned driving
In the blue-detuned regime, the optomechanical damp-
ing rate γopt is negative.
Initially, this results in an
increase in the oscillator’s effective temperature.
As
the overall damping rate γm + γopt becomes negative,
any small initial fluctuation will grow exponentially over
time, eventually reaching a steady-state regime. These
are referred to as self-induced optomechanical oscillations
(or phonon lasing regime) , where the mechanical oscilla-
tion amplitude stabilizes at a fixed value Xm. The gov-
erning dynamical equations are given by:
