Temperature Dependence of the Resonance Frequency and Its Relation to the
Fitting Functions
Figure S3 shows the temperature dependence of the relative frequency shift, ∆fr/fr. At
higher temperatures, ∆fr/fr decreases exponentially, consistent with the empirical temper-
ature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth [6],

where Tc is the superconducting critical temperature. Assuming that the change ∆λ(T) =
λ(T) −λ(0) is small compared to λ(0) (λ(T) ≃λ(0)), the relative frequency shift can be
related to ∆λ(T) as

total capacitance per unit length of the resonator and l is the length of the resonator. The
first equation can be applied to other resonance mode like the quarter-wavelength resonance
and higher-order resonance modes. In the second equation, we assume a one-dimensional
superconducting nanowire in which the current density is uniform. For such a nanowire with
width w and thickness d, the kinetic inductance is given by [8]

For a superconductor with nonuniform current distribution, the geometric factor is multi-
plied to the equation above [9]. From eqs. (11) and (12), it is clearly seen that the res-
onance frequency decreases with increasing temperature. Additionally, when Lk,l/Lt,l ≃1
