elements such as C, N, and H to escape. The loss of organic cations generates numerous vacancies 
and a negative volume strain, leading to structural instability. The unstable intermediate structure 
then transforms into the PbBr₂ structure with a smaller volume, while the energy released from the 
volume strain is converted into crack formation energy. The energy relationship can be described 
as follows [43,44]:

where 𝐵 is the bulk modulus, 𝜌 the crack density, ∆𝑉𝑉
⁄  the relative volume change, 2𝑎 the crack 
length, 𝛾 the surface tension (0.1-1 N/m2 for crystals), and 𝑛 the number of cracks per unit area. 
Additional structural parameters are listed in Table S3 (Supplementary material).

The left part of Equation (1) represents the energy density of volume strain, and the right part 
indicates the crack formation surface energy per unit area. Based on the 𝜌 and 𝑛 values obtained
