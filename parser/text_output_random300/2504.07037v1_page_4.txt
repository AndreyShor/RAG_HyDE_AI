Table I.
Contribution to the energy (in units of Hartree) from different cliques.
We combine cliques giving the same energy
contribution into supercliques. The table provides the six most important supercliques, and for our quantum hardware executions,
we pick only the top three. IYZZYIIIIIII is a shorthand for I ⊗Y ⊗Z ⊗Z ⊗Y ⊗I ⊗I ⊗I ⊗I ⊗I ⊗I ⊗I. Furthermore, we have
omitted for the sake of simplicity the ‘hat’ on top of each Pauli operator in a string. The operator, ˆVi, in the heading for the last
column refers to the clique-wise unitary for the ith clique that occurs in Figure 2. The energies are rounded off to six decimal places.
Superclique no.

observed during the time of execution of our tasks on the
commercially available IonQ Forte-I quantum computer)
yields an expected result fidelity of ∼(0.9928)12515 = 0,
whereas to obtain a result fidelity of about 0.85, we require
to optimize the circuit such that it has only about 20 two-
qubit gates. With regard to the number of Pauli words in
the Hamiltonian, it is worth noting that each term would
correspond to one circuit evaluation per VQE iteration, and
thus to avoid accumulating errors over evaluation of several
circuits as well as reduce the cost involved in such a com-
putation, we need to employ resource reduction strategies
to reduce the number of measurements. The resource re-
duction techniques used in the current work are based on
those used in Ref. [43].
1.
Reducing the number of two-qubit gates
Our resource reduction workflow begins with leveraging
the C2v point group symmetry [44] to reduce the number
of excitation amplitudes.
We obtain the C2v symmetry-
adapted excitations from each reference determinant and
manually remove those excitations that lead to redundant
determinants. We denote the set of linearly independent
amplitudes thus obtained as ⃗˜θ. We note that the two-qubit
gate count reduces from 12515 to 3995 with the application
of C2v symmetry while incurring no loss in the calculated
ground state energy. We then perform VQE on a classical
computer with our MRUCC ansatz to obtain the converged
excitation amplitudes, ⃗˜θ∗, which we then use to construct
the circuit for ˆU(⃗˜θ∗) |Φ⟩and measure the Hamiltonian on
the state on a quantum computer, to obtain the ground
state energy. This is in contrast to a full VQE calculation,
where each iteration would be carried out on a quantum
computer. We do not opt for this procedure due to the pro-
hibitively high costs involved for such a calculation, as well
as the errors that would be accumulated in such a task ex-
ecution. In particular, we need to execute nHniter number
of circuits, where nH is the number of terms in the Hamil-
tonian, which typically scales as N 4 for an N-spin-orbital
calculation, and niter is the number of iterations. For our
work, we use the Sequential Least SQuares Programming
(SLSQP) optimizer [45], with which we incur 636 iterations
in a 44-parameter VQE (as opposed to 2092 iterations in
a 138-parameter VQE without leveraging point group sym-
metry).
This step is followed by performing energy-sort VQE [46]
to pick a dominant excitation. Although the original work
does not advocate picking only the dominant excitation (a
double excitation where the spin-orbital 1 →4 and 7 →10;
the ordering of spin-orbital indices starts from 0, and follows
the block spin arrangement), this becomes a necessity in
view of current-day gate fidelities. The inclusion of each ad-
ditional excitation incurs many two-qubit gates, thus mak-
ing the circuit optimization that follows harder and with a
final two-qubit gate count that is outside of the scope of
obtaining reasonable results using current hardware. The
energy sort VQE step leads to 115 two qubit gates with a
loss of 1.83% in the active space energy. We note that the
calculated energy with this one-parameter approximation
is −3.590735 Ha. Next, the one-parameter quantum circuit
is optimized using Qiskit L3 [40] →Pytket [47] →PyZX
[48] →Qiskit L3 routines in tandem. This step reduces the
total two-qubit gate count to 43 with no loss in energy. The
circuit undergoes another layer of optimization by an agent
trained by reinforcement learning and Graph Neural Net-
works to enforce rules based on ZX-calculus [49], followed
