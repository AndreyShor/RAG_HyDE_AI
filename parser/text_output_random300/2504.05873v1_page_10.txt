which is particularly relevant for ALP searches with large momentum transfer.
The limit for C0 in eq. (2.20) is sufficient for our phenomenological discussion since at
least one of the photons will be on-shell, or at least approximately so, see section 3.2. To
summarise the resulting effective coupling, one has

for derivative and pseudoscalar coupling, respectively. For t ≫m2
ℓ, the vertex function for
the pseudoscalar couplings is suppressed, while it approaches a constant for the derivative
coupling. In the following, we will often suppress the argument, as it is clear from the
subscript whether we refer to the on- or off-shell coupling.

given in eq. (2.19) with the limiting values in eqs. (2.17) and (2.18), respectively.

ALP Production at Lepton Beam Dumps
Beam-dump experiments are a valuable asset in the search for physics beyond the Standard
Model (BSM). The general setup of a beam-dump experiment is depicted schematically in
figure 2. A high-intensity beam, usually consisting of protons, electrons or muons, impinges
upon a target material. Inside this target, countless Standard Model processes take place,
creating particles such as pions or kaons [67]. However, a small fraction of the interactions
might produce a weakly interacting BSM particle X, for example, an ALP. In order to
shield the detectors from the SM background, the beam dump is positioned downstream of
the target. The dump absorbs the shower of particles, and only weakly interacting particles
are able to pass. Once past the dump, the particle X may decay back into Standard Model
particles, which leads to a signature in the detectors placed downstream of the dump [68].
Beam-dump experiments are well-suited to searches for particles in the mass range
O(MeV) −O(GeV) with tiny couplings to Standard Model particles.
These feebly in-
teracting particles have long lifetimes and decay lengths and are consequently difficult to
