2.2.4. Matrix elements of superoperator eU0(s)
In order to proceed, we need to first compute
the quantity (11| eU0(s)|11). Let us start with Eq. (23) and write it as
eU0(s) = G +λG T1G +λ 2G T1G T1G +λ 3G T1G T1G T1G +...,
(32)
where we have defined
G ≡

(s+λ)I+iH×

−1 .

The upshot of Eqs. (31) and (32) is that for the initial condition chosen as in Eq. (26) and
our query for the stay-put probability for level 1 (after a series of evolutions in time), we are
led to consider only the 4 × 4 Hilbert space spanned by the states |11), |22), |12) and |21).
Thus, even though the full 9×9 matrix of G contains, apart from the jump rate λ, four distinct
energy parameters ε12, ε13 and ε23 as well as terms involving ∆(see Eq. (20)), only ε12 (and its
negative) and ∆within the above-mentioned 4×4 Hilbert space are operative. In other words,
the third level has only a passive role in replenishing the level 2, which by coherent coupling
with level 1 influences the occupation of the latter. Note that as mentioned in the Introduction,
the third level is not coherently coupled directly with level 1, but that the influence of the third
level on the system is through application of pulses at random times, a process that induces
stochastic and non-unitary dynamics in the evolution. Therefore, for further calculations, we
may set ε3 to zero. It should be noted though that P1(t) and P2(t) = ⟨2|ρ(t)|2⟩do not sum to
unity because a part of level 2 is leaked out to the level 3.
In the above backdrop, let us rewrite the Hamiltonian H0 in Eq. (18) thus: defining
ε ≡(ε1 + ε2)/2 as the average energy of levels 1 and 2 and δε ≡(ε1 −ε2)/2 as one-half of
the energy gap between levels 1 and 2, we get on neglecting a constant term given by εI that
H0 =
