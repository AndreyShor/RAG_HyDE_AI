Figure 5. Photoelectron spectrum from the only bound state of the same square
well as in Figs. 2-4, subject to one laser pulse with the same characteristics as
in Figs. 2-4 but with only two optical cycles of duration, i.e., τ = 15.71 a.u..
(a) Projection of the spectrum onto stationary states with deﬁnite parity in thin
brown solid line (highly oscillating), the spectrum projected onto the outgoing
Ψ(−) in red dashed line and comparison to the spectrum calculated through
the WOM with window width γ = 0.045 and n = 3 in green solid line.
(b)
Directional photoelectron spectrum calculated projecting the ﬁnal wave function
onto Ψ(r,−) and Ψ(l,−) together with their sum (projection onto Ψ(−)).
The
ionization towards the right (left) is 42.5% (57%).
factor A deﬁned in Eq. (17) as a function of the magnitude of the momentum transfer
|∆p| for ionization by a half-cycle pulse of duration τ = 1 a.u.. We clearly observe that
the asymmetry factor increases monotonically as the momentum transfer increases in
magnitude, tending to unity, which means that all the ionization will be towards the
right and, on the other hand, for weak momentum transfers the asymmetry approaches
to zero, as expected [28]. In the inset we show the diﬀerential asymmetry coeﬃcient
A(E) deﬁned in Eq. (18) and observe that diﬀerent momentum transfers impacts
diﬀerently on the emission asymmetry depending on the kinetic energy of the escaping
electron.
