parameter ϑ Ó ´8 can always be analysed by studying the directed polymer partition
functions in the quasi-critical regime.
1.1. Briefing on the Critical 2D SHF. To make sense of the two-dimensional sto-
chastic heat equation (SHE), we need to first perform a regularisation on small spatial scales
(ultraviolet cutoff) and then take a suitable limit. The regularisation can be accomplished in
different ways. One way is to consider the mollified SHE

where ε ą 0 is the spatial scale of regularisation, jp¨q is a smooth probability kernel on R2
and jεpxq “ ε´2jpx{εq is its scaled version, while ξε :“ jε ˚ ξ is the spatial mollification of
the white noise ξ.
Another way is to discretize space and time. Namely, the white noise ξ is replaced by a
family of i.i.d. random variables ω “ pωpn, xqqnPN,xPZ2 with law P and expectation E, and

Replacing derivatives in (SHE) by suitable difference operators, the solution can be expressed
in terms of the (point-to-point) partition functions of the directed polymer model:

the directed polymer partition functions upNqpt, xq undergo a phase transition (with critical
value ˆβc “ 1) in two different senses:
‚ For each pt, xq P r0, 1q ˆ R2, upNqpt, xq converges to a log-normal limit if ˆβ ă 1 and
converges to 0 if ˆβ ě 1;

limit that solves the additive SHE (or Edwards-Wilkinson equation)
