Next, we turn to some illustrations of Theorems 2.8 and 2.9 in the PDE context.
3.3. Homogeneous perturbations of the Laplacian on Rn. In this subsection
we transition to some PDE applications in connection with (minus) the Laplacian
−∆n on Rn and some of its (homogeneous) perturbations of the form c|x|−2, x ∈
Rn\{0}, n ∈N, n ⩾2, and some c ∈R. This requires some preparations to which
we turn next.
Consider the Bessel operator on (0, ∞) generated by the diﬀerential expression
τγ = −d2

,
γ ∈[0, ∞), x ∈(0, ∞).

The associated maximal and minimal operators Tγ,max and Tγ,min in L2((0, ∞); dx)
associated with τγ are then given by (see, e,g., [39, Ch. 13])
Tγ,maxf = τγf,
γ ∈[0, ∞),
f ∈dom(Tγ,max) =

g ∈L2((0, ∞); dx)

Tγ,min = Tγ,max,
γ ∈[1, ∞),
(3.86)
where the generalized boundary values eg(0) and eg ′(0) are of the form

Then
T ∗
γ,max = Tγ,min,
T ∗
γ,min = Tγ,max,
γ ∈[0, 1),
(3.89)
Tγ,max = T ∗
γ,max = T ∗
γ,min = Tγ,min,
γ ∈[1, ∞).

In particular, τγ is in the limit circle case at x = 0 for γ ∈[0, 1) and in the limit
point case at x = 0 for γ ∈[1, ∞); in addition, τγ is in the limit point case at x = ∞
for γ ∈[0, ∞). Consequently, taking into account that
