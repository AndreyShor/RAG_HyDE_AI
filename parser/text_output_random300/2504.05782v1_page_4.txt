Figure 2. Data curation and statistics of our MDK12-Bench. (a) The data curation pipeline consists of four stages: data collection,
screening, parsing, and processing. The knowledge in our benchmark is structured into six interconnected levels: Level 1 - discipline, Level 2
- grade, Level 3 - curriculum, Level 4 - topics, Level 5 - meta-knowledge, and Level 6 - key knowledge point. Statistics of knowledge coverage
of our bench is illustrated in terms of the number of instance occurrences at (b) discipline and grade levels; (c) high-school curriculum level;
and (d) elementary- and middle-school curriculum level. Examples of curriculum-level knowledge points are also demonstrated.
flow to ensure both reliability and broad coverage of the col-
lected questions, laying a robust foundation for subsequent
screening and parsing. We accumulated large-scale question
sets from multiple grade levels, regions, and multimodal
formats to form the metadata source for MDK12-Bench.
Data Screening. After the initial collection, we utilized
a combination of GPT-4o-based automated review and hu-
man inspection, based on a predefined checklist, to filter
the invalid metadata. We removed questions containing
low-quality images or without specific knowledge points.
Additionally, we preserved the question analysis section in
each instance to support chain-of-thought studies, along with
partition information covering exams from 2016 to 2025,
thus allowing examination of potential knowledge evolution
over time. Each question instance was assigned a difficulty
level, facilitating dynamic evaluations and enabling model
performance analysis under varying complexity levels.
Data Parsing. Following the screening stage, we performed
rule-based parsing to transform each question into a struc-
tured format. This process extracted fields such as Year,
Question, Grade Level, Image, Difficulty Level, Answer,
Question Type, Knowledge, Course, Analysis, and Modal-
ity, all of which were systematically stored. By aligning
questions, solutions, and annotations in a standardized struc-
ture, the resulting dataset significantly enhances retrieval
efficiency, allowing models or analysis tools to readily ac-
cess specific subjects, difficulty levels, or knowledge points.
Data Processing. Once the data was parsed, we carried
out additional post-processing steps to ensure linguistic and
formatting consistency. Leveraging the GPT-4o API, we
translated all Chinese text into English, followed by metic-
ulous domain-expert reviews to verify technical accuracy.
For images containing Chinese text, we utilized an image
translation tool and performed manual checks. Furthermore,
we built a comprehensive knowledge structure encompassing
discipline, grade/year, curriculum, chapter/unit, lesson/topic,
and key knowledge points, linking each translated question
to this framework to enrich its academic context.
