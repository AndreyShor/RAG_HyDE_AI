(A.4)
where the first ket in the product refers to atom 1 and
the second to atom 2.
The restriction of basis B(2)(N) to such a reduced
number of states is intended to limit the size of the
matrices used in the numerical computations.
It has
however important consequences.
The basis does not
include atom-pair states such as |P, F⟩whose energy
difference with states |D, D⟩(F¨orster defect) can be
small.
This prevents our simplified model to account
for van der Waals interaction between atoms in |D, D⟩
states. Such interaction is responsible for the well known
Rydberg blockade [9]. In the present case, instead of in-
creasing the dimensionality of the Hilbert space, the van
der Waals interaction was included phenomenologically
as described below.
In the modeling we are brought to consider Rydberg
atom-pairs for which the DDI is stronger than the
Spin-Orbit interaction (the fine structure splitting of the
55D and 54F are 69 MHz and 1.0 MHz respectively). We
will therefore neglect in the calculation the Spin-Orbit
interaction and characterize the atomic state with the
quantum numbers α ≡{mL, S, mS} where S = 1/2 and
mL and mS are the magnetic orbital and spin quantum
numbers.
We observe that neglecting the Spin-Orbit
coupling would be a poor approximation if the 56P
states are included in the basis.
For these states the
fine structure splitting is 572 MHz, comparable to DDI
energies considered here.
In the rotating frame evolving at frequency Nω,
we take as zero the energy of the degenerate basis
states |55Dα, 55Dα′, N⟩. The energies considered in the
B(2)(N) basis set are typically larger than that of the
B(1)(N) set by an amount of the order of the excitation
energy of 55D Rydberg atoms. The two sets can only be
coupled via optical interaction.

Hilbert space sustained by basis B(2)(N) is:

The DDI Hamiltonian is given by:

(A.6)
here e is the elementary charge, ε0 the vacuum permi-
tivity, R is the inter-atomic separation vector and ri are
the electron position vectors relative to the corresponding
atomic nucleus. The Hamiltonian HDD includes the de-
pendence with the polar angle θ between the inter-atomic
axis and the quantization axis z [47]. The details of the
calculation of the matrix elements of HDD in the basis
B(2)(N) can be found in [41, 48].
HDD is responsible for the lifting of the degeneracy in
the {|D, F, N −1⟩, |F, D, N −1⟩} subspace [49] .
The
corresponding energies are represented by the parallel
asymptotes of the blue lines in Fig. 6. Notice the broad
range of MW frequencies (∼1.7 GHz for the conditions
of Fig.
6) leading to eigenstates with the same total
energy.
The coupling with the MW is described by:
H(2)
MW = ℏΩMW (ˆz1 ⊗12 + 11 ⊗ˆz2)
(A.7)
where ΩMW is the microwave Rabi frequency.
Lower
indeces refer to the corresponding atom.
H(2)
MW is responsible for the avoided crossings between
the eigenenergies of HDD.
Finally, HvdW represents the van der Waals energy
shift of the |Dα, Dα′⟩states.
Such shift results from
second order coupling with states outside the basis set
[9, 41]. It is included phenomenologically as an isotropic
interaction [50].
