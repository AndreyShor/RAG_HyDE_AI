A.6 Interpretation of the Algebra
From the above, this algebra has the properties of an inﬁnite-dimensional Lie
algebra and can be decomposed as a direct sum of commutative subalgebras.
At least for the non-trivial part, it has a Witt algebra structure. The potential
relation to the w(∞) algebra is also an interesting direction for further investiga-
tion, as it may reveal deeper connections with symmetries of higher-dimensional
branes or extended objects in M-theory.

Detailed Derivation of the Gauge Parameter
Constraints (RVPD) from the Gauge Restric-
tion Condition
This appendix provides the technical details of how the gauge parameter con-
straints (RVPD) are derived from the gauge restriction condition.
B.1 Preliminaries
We consider a membrane in 11-dimensional spacetime (two spatial dimensions
and one temporal dimension).
After an appropriate gauge ﬁxing of the Nambu–Goto action, the bosonic
part of the action can be written as
S =
Z
d3σ 1
2{XI, XJ, XK}2.
(B.1)
Here, XI = XI(σ1, σ2, σ3), where σ1, σ2, σ3 are coordinates on the worldvolume
of the membrane.
From here on, the index i = 1, 2, 3 refers to the worldvolume coordinates σi,
and the index I = 0, . . . , 10 refers to the spacetime coordinates XI.
The expression {XI, XJ, XK} denotes the Nambu bracket, deﬁned by
{XI, XJ, XK} ≡ǫijk ∂XI
∂σi
∂XJ
∂σj
∂XK
∂σk .
(B.2)
The membrane action is invariant under volume-preserving deformations (VPD)
of the form
δV P DXI ≡{Q1, Q2, XI}
(B.3)
where Q1 and Q2 are arbitrary gauge parameters depending on (σ1, σ2, σ3).
We assume that the gauge parameters are suﬃciently smooth and free of
singularities with respect σ3. On the other hand, we allow for some degree of
local discontinuities or zeros with respect to σ1 and σ29. We also assume that
appropriate boundary conditions are imposed on the gauge parameters.
9This is because σ3 plays the role of a time-like or evolution parameter, as discussed in the
equations of motion in the main body of the paper.
