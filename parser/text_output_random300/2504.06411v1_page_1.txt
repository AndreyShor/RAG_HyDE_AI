On Stochastic Variational Principles
Archishman Saha
Abstract
The study of stochastic variational principles involves the problem of constructing fixed-endpoint and
adapted variations of semimartingales. We provide a detailed construction of variations of semimartingales
that are not only fixed at deterministic endpoints, but also fixed at first entry times and first exit times for
charts in a manifold. We prove a stochastic version of the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations in the
context of these variations. Using this framework, we provide a generalization of the stochastic Hamilton-
Pontryagin principle in local coordinates to arbitrary noise semimartingales. For the corresponding global
form of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle, we introduce a novel approach to global variational
principles by restricting to semimartingales obtained as solutions of Stratonovich equations.

Introduction
Variational principles are ubiquitous in mechanical systems. At its heart, these principles involves finding a curve
that extremizes an action integral among all curves with fixed endpoint conditions. While introducing noise
in the framework of mechanics, one is naturally tempted to extend deterministic variational principles to the
stochastic regime. Two distinct kinds of stochastic variational principles exist in the literature: the first involves
a stochastic action obtained by perturbing a deterministic Lagrangian by external noise; see, for instance, Street
and Takao [1], L´azaro-Cam´ı and Ortega [2], Bou-Rabee and Owhadi [5], Holm [19], Arnaudon et. al. [7], Cruzeiro
et. al. [8] and Crisan and Street [20]. The second is a deterministic action, evaluated by averaging a stochastic
integral obtained from a single deterministic Lagrangian acting on stochastic paths. This viewpoint is present,
for instance, in the works of Yasue [15], Cipriano and Cruzeiro [3], Arnaudon and Cruzeiro [16], Arnaudon, Chen
and Cruzeiro [18], Zambrini [17] and Huang and Zambrini [21]. This also provides a probabilistic interpretation
of Feynman’s path integral approach to quantum mechanics and the reader is referred to Zambrini [22] for more
details on this.
In this paper we will focus on the first viewpoint. Here the action is defined via a Stratonovich integral. While
the Stratonovich integral behaves well under coordinate transformations, it poses some analytic difficulties. As
remarked in Emery [12], unlike Itˆo integrals, a dominated convergence theorem is not true for Stratonovich
integrals. Thus, in general, it is not true that if (Γn) is a sequence of semimartingales that converge pointwise to
a semimartingale Γ and are dominated by a locally bounded process then the Stratonovich integrals
R
Γn ◦dX
converges almost surely to
R
Γ ◦dX for any semimartingale X uniformly on compacts in probability (ucp). This
means that if Γ and X are real-valued semimartingales and {Γϵ} is a family of semimartingales such that Γ0,t = Γt
and the maps ϵ 7→Γϵ,t(ω) are smooth for almost every sample point ω, then one cannot conclude directly that
the Stratonovich integral
R Γϵ−Γ
ϵ
◦dX converges ucp to
R
∂
∂ϵ

ϵ=0Γϵ ◦dX. To overcome this difficulty, we assume
differentiability in terms of the semimartingale topology as opposed to ucp topology.
Introducing stochasticity also leads to local and global difficulties in variational principles. The global issue
involves fixing the final condition in the variational principle. In general, fixing a stochastic process to assume
a certain distribution at a future time may lead to breakdown in adaptedness with respect to a given filtration.
This leads to the problem of constructing fixed endpoint and adpated variations of a stochastic process Γ.
Broadly, two distinct solutions exist to this problem in the literature. They differ in the choice of the final
time in the variational principle. The first involves fixing a compact set K that contains the initial condition
Γ0 = a, for some point a in the manifold, and fixing the final time to be the first exit time τK of Γ from K. One
then defines a vector field X such that X vanishes on {a} ∪∂K and constructs a variational family that yields
the variation δΓ = X(Γ). This ensures that δΓ equals 0 at t = 0 and at t = τK. This approach is present in the
works of L´azaro-Cam´ı and Ortega [2] and Street and Takao [1]. While suited to the stochastic environment, it is
not clear how this technique applies in the simpler deterministic set-up.
