Besides, in the three hiddn layer architecture, the accuracy is constrained by number of quantized states. Hence it is 
unlikely that longer bitstream can attain any considerable improvement beyond 96.82% (highest attained accuracy for 
the systems). We also note that for a system where inference acuracy of 92% is sufficient, 100 bit SC system with one 
hidden layer architecture may be adequate while for a system with required accuracy of 96%, 100 bit SC system with 
three hidden layer architecture can be used. 
The performance of these networks can be compared with other contemporary works. Reference [24] achieved 95% 
accuracy for 1024 bit long stream. In this work, 94.33% accuracy was obtained for 500 bits for 11 quantized weights 
for one hidden layer architecture. Daniels et al reported 97% accuracy using Lenet-5 architecture with bitstream length 
of 128 [25]. They used traditional digital circuitry to conrol bitstream statistics of SMTJ. Lenet-5 incorporates 6 hidden 
layers with multiple convolutional layers. Unipolar encoding for SC was incorporated, hence separate excitatory and 
inhibitory subnetworks were used to accommodate  positive and negative weights. They used resolution of

SMTJ. Here we achieved similar accuracy with 100 bit long stream with 3 hidden layer architecture with broader 
resolution of
