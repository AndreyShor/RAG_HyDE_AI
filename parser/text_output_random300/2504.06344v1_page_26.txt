The action density, integrated over all but one direction of the torus, for SU(3) with
r = 2, k = 1, on the tuned torus with ∆(2, 1, 2) = 0 and sides (32, 8, 8, 8). All of the 214 configurations
are found to have non-constant action density. Only a few appear that are almost constant. We use
these to test the λ-expansion, see section 4.3.
These are 3 real conditions on the 8 real coefficients in C0,1
1,2. There is also an unphysical phase
corresponding to a U(1)ω, a constant gauge transformation in the ω direction, eqn. (1.1).
Thus, together with the 4 translational moduli ˆϕC′=1
µ
≡ˆϕµ, the parts of C0,1
1,2 not fixed by (4.6),
make up the eight moduli of the Q = 2/3 instanton. Locally, we choose a parameterization of
the solutions of (4.6) as follows (noting that the U(1)ω acts as a common phase on all C0,1
2,4):
C1
2 = eiχ1η cos θ ,
C0
2 = e−iχ2η sin θ ,
C1
4 = −ieiχ2η sin θ ,
C0
4 = ie−iχ1η cos θ ,
(4.7)
with a single real noncompact modulus η and compact moduli θ, χ1, χ2. We note, however,
that the solution is only trustable for small values of η, since it is obtained by neglecting the
nonlinear terms in the self-duality condition (2.17, 2.18). We have, using our index notation,
remembering that we have k = 1, ℓ= 2, the order λ0 solution has the form:
