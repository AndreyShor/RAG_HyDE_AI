where ϕi is the phase shift for each propagation segment (ϕi =
(2π/λ) · lprop), and j is the number of couplings in the path
(each coupling from waveguide to ring or ring to waveguide
contributing a phase of π/2). We would like to note that the
π/2 phase shift is strictly true for a lossless beam splitter, but
works well in practice for modelling our devices.
The total transmission power for each path is given by:
A = Ri−2(1 −R)2 Y
j
Aj,
(5)
where Aj is the transmission power for jth propagation
segment, and i denotes the total number of port interactions in
the path. We include the multiplicative factor R−2(1−R)2 to
correct for the signal’s injection at the L-port and extraction
at the T-port, which correspond to signal transmission, rather
than reflection. This compensates for the recursive pathfinding
algorithm’s implicit assumption that all port interactions are
reflective, ensuring that the computed transmission power
accurately models physical launch and detection conditions.
Each path, therefore, has an associated path length from
which one can estimate the signal arrival time and the accu-
mulated phase and propagation loss. If multiple paths converge
at time T, within the system timing uncertainty (± 5 ns), their
phasors are summed to account for multi-path interference:
A(T) =

(6)
where P(T) denotes all paths whose arrival time is T, Pm is
the signal power, and Φm is the net phase for path m.
Finally, the contributions from all paths are summed to
obtain the total time-domain response:
S21(t) =

Akδ(t −tk),
(7)
where tk is the time delay associated with path k.
To validate the model against measured time-domain trans-
mission data, we time-gate the signal from the launch port
to the drop port to generate the template for the temporal
pulse which accounts for the spectral shaping induced by the
transmit and receive IDTs and the complex phase shifts at
the waveguide-taper interface. The convolution of the impulse
response from Eq.7 with the isolated first arriving pulse (the
direct transit, 1d) provides a model of the full temporal
transmission characteristics, as noted in the main text. The
comparison of the measured and simulated temporal responses
demonstrates the utility of the model in capturing the com-
plicated multipath propagation effects observed in phononic
ring resonators, namely the temporal distribution of arriving
acoustic pulses and the identification of interference patterns
resulting from multiple propagation paths.
Table I lists the extracted model parameters for the repre-
sentative point coupled and pulley coupled devices discussed
in the main text. We can clearly see that the model shows

that the rings approach critical coupling (r≈a) in the pulley
coupled rings from the undercoupled regime (r > a) in
the point-coupled devices, as expected. The fitting procedure
makes some simplifications, and there are two free parameters,
namely lidt and lwvg, that are used to align the measured and
model temporal response. But once they are fixed, the rest of
the model parameters can be extracted analytically and they
give very good agreement with the measured data, as shown
in Fig.6 for the drop port. As noted in the main text, we
currently don’t understand the reasons behind the large device-
to-device variation in R beyond fabrication imperfections, and
especially how it compares to what we can calculate using
FEM simulations [1].
More broadly, this computational methodology successfully
captures the complex temporal dynamics of phononic ring
resonators, as evidenced by Fig.6 fitting the drop port data.
By leveraging graph-based pathfinding, phase accumulation,
and attenuation modelling, this approach provides a powerful
tool for analysing multi-path propagation effects in phononic
circuits.
