Solutions and discussion
The solutions of Eqs. (22)-(26) are listed in Table 1. As discussed in the previous section, they
yield the magnetic and spin glass renormalization group ﬁxed points of the random bond Ising
model (Figure 1), and our next task is to identify which ﬁxed point corresponds to which
solution. For this purpose, we must ﬁrst of all observe that the form of the crossing and
unitarity equations (11) and (12) is such that, given a solution, another solution is obtained
reversing the sign of all the scattering amplitudes. It follows that the space of solutions of the
exact ﬁxed point equations provided by scattering theory in two dimensions is always made
of pairs of solutions related by such “sign reversal”. In some cases only one member of a pair
is of physical interest, the other being automatically generated by the form of the equations.
In our present case, the pairs are A+ and A−, B+ and B−, as well as C and D.
A second observation is that the solutions of Table 1 exhibit also another type of pairing,
this time speciﬁc to the problem we are studying. Indeed, given the values of S0 and S7 =
