As a result, under RVPD, the terms {Q1, Q2} and Σ(Q1, Q2; XI) in the
decomposition of the Nambu bracket vanish, and the deformation takes the
simpliﬁed form
δRXI = {τ(Q1, Q2), XI}.
(B.14)
The physical meaning of each of the parameter constraints is as follows:
• {Q1, Q2} = 0: This indicates that the Poisson bracket on the (σ1, σ2)
plane vanishes, implying that Q1 and Q2 are locally dependent on each
other in the two-dimensional base space.
• ∂σ3τ(Q1, Q2) = 0: This implies that τ(Q1, Q2) is independent of σ3, and
can therefore be regarded as a constant along the σ3 direction.
• ∂σ3∂aQ1,2 = 0: This condition ensures that the (σ1, σ2)-dependence of Q1
and Q2 remains unchanged under diﬀerentiation with respect to σ3.
These constraints can be interpreted as strong restrictions on the σ3-dependence
of the gauge parameters, imposed to prevent large variations in the σ3 direc-
tion from violating the gauge restriction condition. In particular, the condition
{Q1, Q2} = 0 is the most essential one for ensuring that the arbitrary function
f(σ1, σ2) remains unchanged.
B.2.1 Comparison with Conventional Gauge Fixing Condi-
tions
In a conventional gauge ﬁxing procedure, one selects a particular choice of f,
thereby ﬁxing the gauge freedom by restricting the system to a single geometric
surface (gauge-ﬁxing surface) corresponding to that speciﬁc value.
In contrast, the gauge restriction condition treated in this work considers
the entire family of such surfaces corresponding to all possible choices of f, and
requires that none of them be altered under gauge transformations.
As a result, constraints such as {Q1, Q2} = 0 naturally emerge, and the
resulting structure is qualitatively diﬀerent from that of ordinary gauge ﬁxing.
This approach is essential in our framework in order to consistently treat
the Nambu bracket, volume-preserving deformations, and quantization (matrix
regularization)17.
B.3 Proof of Suﬃciency
We ﬁrst show that, as a suﬃcient condition, if the constraints on the gauge
parameters are satisﬁed, then the gauge restriction condition is preserved.
17In this work, we adopt this approach in order to treat the Nambu bracket, volume-
preserving deformations, and quantization (matrix regularization) in a consistent manner.
However, this does not preclude the possibility of other approaches. The existence of alter-
native methods for quantizing the Nambu bracket or performing matrix regularization lies
beyond the scope of this study, and the discussion remains open.
