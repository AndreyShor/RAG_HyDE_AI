ω = ±(∆l −∆r)/ħh [71,72], because the lowest energy quasiparticles need to acquire energy
|∆l −∆r| in order to tunnel to the other lead.
So far, we have considered a vanishing Dynes parameter, να = 0. In the case of να > 0, the
logarithmic singularities of the polarization operators ΠR
n/s(ω) acquire an imaginary part on
the order of −i(νl + νr), which broadens the sharp features of the polarization operator at the
real frequencies. In time domain, this corresponds to the exponential decay of ΠR
n/s(t) on the
time scale of (νl + νr)−1. In the rest of the paper, we assume να = 0 and provide qualitative
reasoning for the case of non-vanishing Dynes parameters. We also restrict our analysis to the
case of a symmetric junction ∆l = ∆r, for simplicity.

Quasiclassical limit
To clarify the physical meaning of the polarization operator, we explore the quasiclassical limit
of the junction dynamics. To do so, we employ stochastic unraveling by applying Hubbard–
Stratonovich transformation [67,73,74] to the terms of the action (2) which include Keldysh
component of polarization operator [75] (see details in Appendix B):

This action governs the dissipative dynamics of the phase degree of freedom explicitly driven
by the shot noise. In the classical limit, the current through the junction is given by first
variation of this action over the quantum phase:

We can make two important remarks about Eq. (11). First, the current is not an instan-
