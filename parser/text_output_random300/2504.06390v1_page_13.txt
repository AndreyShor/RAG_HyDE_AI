intensity. This behavior is consistent with widening the energy gap at the zero Landau level
due to the enhanced magnetic confinement of the charge carriers. As the magnetic field
increases, more photon energy is required to excite interband transitions, resulting in the
observed shift. At the same time, the stronger localization leads to more significant overlap
between electron and phonon wavefunctions, thereby enhancing the oscillator strength of the
transitions. Among the four substrates, SiO2 and SiC exhibit the most pronounced absorp-
tion enhancement, likely due to their balanced η and ℏωSO, which optimizes the electron-
phonon coupling strength. In contrast, HfO2 shows the weakest peak response, further
highlighting the importance of substrate phonon energy in determining the magnitude of the
polaron effect, even when the polarization parameter is high.
On the other hand, in Figure 2(b), where an in-plane electric field of F = 0.3 V/nm is
applied, the absorption spectra exhibit an even more pronounced response to the magnetic
field.
Compared to the zero-field case, the absorption peaks become sharper, stronger,
and more blue-shifted, confirming the cooperative role of electric and magnetic fields in
modulating the polaronic dynamics. The electric field enhances carrier localization in the
graphene sheet, which increases their interaction with surface optical phonons and further
strengthens the polaron binding. As a result, the polaron-induced energy gap widens more
rapidly with magnetic field strength, requiring higher photon energies to activate optical
transitions. This leads to more intense absorption and broader spectral features. Again,
SiO2 and SiC stand out with the highest absorption coefficients, confirming their optimal
combination of polarization strength and phonon energy. The case of HfO2 remains an
exception, with comparatively weaker absorption even under the combined influence of B
and F, due to its low ℏωSO, which limits the available phonon-mediated transition energy
despite its high η value. These results suggest that external fields can be effectively used
to tune the optical response of graphene–substrate heterostructures, especially when the
substrate supports strong and energetically favorable polaronic interactions.
In all scenarios, the absorption coefficient increases with photon energy, reaching a well-
