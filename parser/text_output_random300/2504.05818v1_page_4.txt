Thus, there should exist two states ηlow
1
and ηhigh
1
, whose
masses are located between the masses of pure q¯qg and
s¯sg hybrids. If we take ηhigh
1
as η1(1855), as in our previ-
ous work [50], we can determine that the mixing angle is
about 28.8◦, with which the location of ηlow
1
state is then
around 1640 MeV, below we will denote it as η1(1640).
Finally, for the ground q¯sg state, we predict that it is lo-
cated around 1.8 GeV, which is consistent with Ref. [46].
However, for the first excited state of q¯qg hybrid with
isospin-1, our result exhibit a very large uncertainty.
That is because when treating the hybrid as a three-body
problem, there are two possible exciting modes, one is be-
tween q¯q, the other is between gluon and q¯q cluster, i.e., if
using the language of baryon, they are corresponding to
the ρ-mode exciting, and λ-mode exciting, respectively.
In addition, in our work, we adopt three kinds of confine-
ments, which will have very different descriptions on the
behaviors of excited states. As a result, the uncertainty of
the first excited state of q¯qg hybrid with isospin-1 is very
large, although it can contain the location of π1(2015).
Here, one may ask why the uncertainties for the ground
states are very small, and our answer contains two as-
pects, one is that there are no ρ-mode or λ-mode excit-
ing for ground states, the other is that for ground states,
the mass differences caused by different confinements are
very small, and such phenomena actually also shows up
in meson and baryon spectra.
Nevertheless, it may indeed shows that QCD, and the
potential model derived from it, is an uniform theory.
That means as long as we can reproduce the spectra
of mesons and baryons, since the coupling constant in
QCD is global, a generalization to the spectra of hybrids
or glueballs, at least for ground states, may be convinc-
ing. According to our further calculations, this primary
conclusion may also be valid for decay widths, and our
results on widths are collected in Table I
As we can see from Table I, although we treat the hy-
brid as a three-body problem and Refs. [46, 50] treat it
as a quasi two-body problem, and the model parameters
we used are totally different.
As if we get the similar
spectra and adopt the same transition mechanism, most
of our results are consistent to each other. Comparing to
Ref. [46], the main difference comes from the b1(1235)π
channel of π1(1600), which results into the differences of
K1(1270)π and K1(1400)π channels of K1(1−+), since
K1(1270) and K1(1400) are mixtures of K1(1P1) and
K1(3P1) states, and b1(1235) is also a 1P1 state. While
comparing to Ref. [50], i.e., our previous work, the main
differences come from the a1(1260)π and π(1300)π chan-
nels. According to our crosscheck, for a1(1260)π channel,
it mainly due to the sensitivity on phase space caused by
the node of Laguerre polynomials. While for π(1300)π
channel, it comes from the simulation on the wave func-
tion of π(1300), since in Ref. [50], we use just one single
Laguerre polynomial to simulate the wave function of the
first excited state of π, which is less accurate than this
work, where the wave function of π(1300) is also given
by GEM method.
TABLE I: Numerical results and comparisons of decay widths
(in MeV×αs unit just as in Refs. [46, 50, 57]) for π1(1600),
η1(1640), η′
1(1855), and K1(1−+) in screened, linear and
square confinements (abbreviated as [Scr., Lin., Squ.]). For
the mixing angle of η1(1640) and η1(1855), as in Ref. [50], we
take 28.8◦for comparison.

Nevertheless, according to our numerical results, we
keep similar conclusions as in Ref. [50] that, in cur-
rent decay mechanism, we cannot explain π1(1600) and
η1(1855) as 1−+ hybrids simultaneously, and the η1(1855)
observed by BESIII in Jψ →γηη′ may not be a hybrid
since under this situation its decay width to ηη′ is nearly
zero.
Then, to search for an isospin-0 hybrid located
around 1855 MeV and an isospin- 1
2 hybrid located around
1800 MeV, the golden channels may be K1(1270) ¯K and
K1(1270)π, respectively. Furthermore, there may exist
a partner of η′
1(1855), whose mass is around 1640 MeV,
and future experiments can search the a1(1260)π channel
to verify it. As for π1(1600), more precise analysis may
be needed to see if it is really a broad structure.
