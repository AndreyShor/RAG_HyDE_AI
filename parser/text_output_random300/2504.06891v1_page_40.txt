Accounting for levels, conﬁgurations and superconﬁgurations
The computation is initialized an average-atom calculation, providing the mean populations of
the subshells and a list of superconﬁgurations:

where nNℓN is, at a given temperature and density, the highest-energy bound subshell predicted
by the average-atom calculation. The LTE ﬂuctuation theory is then applied to the average-
atom non-integer mean populations to establish the range of variation for the populations qk,
where k = 1, N. This process deﬁnes the possible conﬁgurations (if qk = 0) or superconﬁgu-
rations (if qk > 0). The superconﬁgurations are subsequently sorted based on their respective
Boltzmann probabilities, initially estimated using the average-atom wavefunctions and eigen-
energies. Next, a self-consistent calculation is performed for each superconﬁguration, which has
therefore its own potential and corresponding set of wavefunctions and eigen-energies, used to
reevaluate the probabilities.
The power of this hybrid approach lies in its ability to account for numerous highly excited
states and satellite lines. Although their probabilities may be small, their large number means
they are likely to make a signiﬁcant contribution to the total opacity. In SCO-RCG, orbitals
are handled individually up to a speciﬁed limit, beyond which they are merged into a single
supershell (referred to as the Rydberg supershell). The grouped orbitals (in this case, those
