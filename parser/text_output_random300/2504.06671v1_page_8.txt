Optical transitions should not be affected by 
interference from the host material’s electronic 
states. 
Nuclear spin-free isotopes: constituent elements 
should have isotopes with zero nuclear spin to 
minimize decoherence effects. 
Energy separations between defect states must be 
large enough to prevent thermal excitations that 
could destroy spin coherence. 
 
 
 
3. Defects in silicon carbide 
SiC is a wide-bandgap (3.26 eV in 4H-SiC) semiconductor with exceptional properties, making it a key 
material for power electronics and radiation detection applications [41,42,43,44]. It exists in more than 
250 polytypes, with 4H-SiC being the most extensively studied. The 4H (hexagonal) polytype is preferred 
for electronic components due to its high and nearly isotropic carrier mobility, which enhances device 
performance [41,44]. A similar trend is observed in quantum applications, where 4H-SiC remains the 
dominant choice due to its favorable optical and spin properties. However, other polytypes, such as 3C-
SiC (cubic) and 6H-SiC (hexagonal), are gaining increasing attention for quantum technologies, as recent 
studies suggest they may offer unique advantages for hosting defect-based qubits [45,46,47,48]. 
For a more detailed discussion of the material properties of SiC and its most commonly used polytypes 
(3C, 4H, and 6H), we refer readers to Ref.[41,43, 44, 49], as well as the references within. These handbooks 
and review papers provide comprehensive insights into the structural, electrical, and optical 
characteristics of SiC, making them essential reading for those interested in both fundamental and applied 
aspects of the material. 
Among the many remarkable properties of SiC, its crystallographic structure plays a crucial role in defect 
engineering. Due to the presence of multiple non-equivalent lattice sites in the primitive cell, point defects 
in SiC can form in different configurations, significantly influencing their electronic and spin properties. 
The 3C polytype, shown in figure 4a, has cubic symmetry with a single C and Si atom in the primitive cell. 
The 4H polytype has hexagonal symmetry and 8 atoms in the primitive cell of which 2 are non-equivalent 
for both Si and C (figure 4b). The 6H polytype is also of hexagonal symmetry, has 12 atoms in the primitive 
cell, and 3 are non-equivalent for both Si and C (figure 4c). Therefore, a single site defect in 4H has two 
configurations, and three in 6H-SiC. A pair defect then has four and six configurations in 4H and 6H-SiC, 
respectively. The non-equivalent sites are denoted as h (hexagonal) and k (quasi-cubic) [50,51].
