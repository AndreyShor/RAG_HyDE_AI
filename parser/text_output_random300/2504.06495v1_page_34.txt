essential features of a deeper, more fundamental dynamics — possibly one grounded in an
underlying discrete dynamics, as discussed in Section 2.3.

Continuous-time process with exogenous barrier
We begin by reconsidering the exogenous threshold from our earlier analysis. Throughout
this section, we work with the continuous-time version of the branching model introduced in
Section 4.2. Our ﬁrst goal is to characterize the stationary distribution of this process. Our
second goal is to evaluate E[Φτ | Φτ > 0] in this steady state. This will serve as a useful
precursor to the subsequent analysis of the endogenous threshold.
Stationary Distribution
Consider the process Xτ deﬁned in (18). We deﬁne the stationary (or steady state) distri-
bution as the limiting distribution of Xτ conditional on survival up to time τ, as τ →∞.
Formally, for any Borel set A ⊂[log ǫ, ∞),
πX(A) := lim
τ→∞P(Xτ ∈A | Xτ ̸= −∞, X0 = x0),
(27)
which turns out to be independent of the initial value x0 > log(ǫ). Let fX(x) denote the
density of πX with respect to Lebesgue measure — we then use the standard notation
πX(dx) = fX(x) dx in the following.
Theorem 4 Consider the continuous-time process Xτ deﬁned in (18) with ﬁxed parameters
µ, σ, ǫ > 0 and initial condition x0 > log(ǫ), and let πX denote the limiting distribution of
the process as deﬁned in (27). Then we have, for x ≥log(ǫ),
πX(dx) = µ

The proof of the theorem is given in the appendix. The continuous-time framework signif-
icantly simpliﬁes this derivation by allowing us to leverage analytical tools from stochastic
calculus, particularly the reﬂection principle for Brownian motion and martingale techniques.
