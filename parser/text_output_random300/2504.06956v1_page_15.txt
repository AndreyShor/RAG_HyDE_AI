Convergence in distributions of random measures. For a locally compact Polish space X, we let
M+(X) be the space of non-negative, locally finite measures on X endowed with the topology of
vague convergence. We equip the space of probability distributions on M+(X) with the topology of
weak convergence. For a collection (νt)t≥0 of M+(X)-valued random variables, we write νt ⇒ν to
indicate vague convergence in distribution as t →∞.
We record here a useful criterion to establish the vague convergence in distributions of M+(X)-valued
random variables.
Lemma 3.2. Let (νt)t≥0 be a collection of M+(X)-valued random variables and let ν ∈M+(X).
If for all f ∈C+
c (X), the following limit holds
lim
t→∞E[exp(−νt(f))] = E[exp(−ν(f))] ,
(3.6)
then it holds that νt ⇒ν as t →∞.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the continuity theorem for Laplace transforms, see e.g.
[Kal17, Theorem 4.11].
Remark 3.3. In what follows, we will be interested in the case X = [n] × Rd which coincides
(including the topology) with the space (M+(Rd))n.
Given a locally compact Polish space X and a Hilbert space Y equipped with a dense subspace Y0, we
consider probability distributions on Y × M+(X). Similarly to before, for a sequence (Y, νt)t≥0 of
Y × M+(X)-valued random variables, we write (Y, νt) ⇒(Y, ν) to indicate vague convergence in
distribution. We now state the following result, which provides sufficient conditions for convergence
in distribution on the space Y × M+(X).
Lemma 3.4. Let (Y, νt)t≥0 be a sequence of Y × M+(X)-valued random variables, and let
ν ∈M+(X). If for all (φ, f) ∈Y0 × C+
c (X) the following limit holds
lim
t→∞E
h
exp(i⟨Y, φ⟩) exp(−νt(f))
i
= E
h
exp(i⟨Y, φ⟩) exp(−ν(f))
i
,
(3.7)
then it holds that (Y, νt) ⇒(Y, ν) as t →∞.
Proof. Taking φ = 0 in (3.7) and using Lemma 3.2, we deduce that νt ⇒ν. Consequently, the
joint distribution (Y, νt) is tight in Y × M+(X). Thus, the joint convergence in distribution follows
if we can show the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions. As both Y and νt are
linear forms, the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions can be inferred from that of the
one-dimensional distributions. Therefore, it suffices to verify that, for all (φ, f) ∈Y0 × C+
c (X), the
following convergence holds
(⟨Y, φ⟩, νt(f)) ⇒(⟨Y, φ⟩, ν(f)) .
(3.8)
Since the random variable ν(f) is almost surely non-negative, it can be readily observed that the
joint convergence in distribution (3.8) holds if the corresponding joint Fourier–Laplace transform
converges, i.e. if (3.7) holds.
Remark 3.5. In what follows, we will be interested in the case X = [n] × Rd and Y = H−κ
loc (Rd),
for some κ > 0, in which case we can take Y0 = C∞
c (Rd).
