THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
The gradual evolution of continuous traits can be effec-
tively described within the framework of adaptive dynamics
[50–54]. We here assume that there are two types of players
in the structured population: a mutant type with trait value
y and a resident type with trait value x (where x and y re-
spectively represent investment strategies in the continuous
game). The pair approximation approach provides a conve-
nient framework to capture the frequency dynamics of strate-
gies, so that the dynamical equation of the trait x can be de-
rived [55–59]. Moreover, this approach enables us to deter-
mine the central quantity of adaptive dynamics, the invasion
fitness f(x, y). This quantity represents the growth rate of a
rare mutant y within a monomorphic resident population with
trait x. It is defined as the per capita growth rate ˙pm/pm in
the limit pm →0.
To derive the adaptive dynamics of trait x, we consider
the selection gradient D(x) =
∂f(x,y)
∂y
|y=x. If D(x) > 0,
nearby mutants with trait values y > x can successfully in-
vade. Whereas if D(x) < 0, mutants with y < x will in-
vade. Traits x∗for which D(x∗) = 0 are known as singular
traits. These traits are convergence stable if the Jacobian of
the selection gradient, CS(x∗) = dD(x)
dx |x=x∗, is negative. In
contrast, a trait is evolutionarily stable if the Hessian of the
fitness, defined as ES(x∗) =
∂2f(x∗,y)
∂y2
|y=x∗, is also nega-
tive, indicating that the invasion fitness f(x, y) has a (local)
maximum at x∗.
Considering the two types of stability, there are four po-
tential outcomes when evaluating a singular strategy x∗that
satisfies D(x∗) = 0 [18].
If the singular trait x∗does not exist, investments evolve
either to their maximum or minimum, depending on the sign
of the selection gradient.
If x∗exists but is not convergence stable, it acts as a re-
pellor and determines that investments evolve towards either
maximum or zero based on their initial investment value x0.
Conversely, if x∗is both convergence stable and evolution-
arily stable, it serves as an attractor for stable intermediate
investments known as ESS, representing an evolutionary end
state.
Finally, if x∗is convergence stable but not evolutionarily
stable, it acts as an evolutionary branching point and potential
starting point for diversification into coexisting high and low
investors.
A.
PGG with linear benefit function
As the linear benefit function is assumed most frequently in
public goods games, we begin by examining the evolution of
cooperative investments with a linear benefit function given
by B(τi) = bτi/n. For the given function, the adaptive dy-
namics can be expressed as
˙x = w(n −3)
(n −2)n
n + 2

(2)
(see Appendix B for detailed derivations), where ˙x represents
the time derivative of strategy x. The right-hand of Eq. (2) cor-
responds to the selection gradient D(x), which symbolically
represents the direction of evolutionary change in the strategy
space.
It is observed that the selection gradient is reduced to a con-
stant and changes sign at r∗= (b/c)∗= n2/(n + 2). This
indicates that there is no singular strategy, leading cooperative
investments to evolve toward either pure defection or pure co-
operation. To be specific, when b/c < r∗, the selection gra-
dient D(x) remains negative for all x in [0,1], suggesting that
cooperative investments will decline to the minimum. Con-
versely, when b/c > r∗, only larger mutations can success-
fully invade, indicating that the trait x evolves towards the
maximum. These findings coincide with the evolutionary out-
comes observed in the linear PGG under discrete strategies
[40]. Additionally, we note that as the group size n increases,
the value of r∗also increases. This implies that as the num-
ber of individuals in the group grows, it becomes increasingly
difficult for cooperation to emerge.

Fig. 2. PIP for PGG with linear benefit function B(τi) = bτi/n.
In the white regions within the separate plots, the invasion fitness
is positive, indicating that mutant traits are capable of invading the
resident population. Parameter values: n = 5, b = 2, c = 1, and
ω = 1 in panel (a); n = 5, b = 5, c = 1, and ω = 1 in panel (b).
This analysis can be further elucidated through the pairwise
invasion plot (PIP). The PIP visually depicts the regions in the
(x, y) space where the mutant strategy y can invade the res-
ident strategy x. Specifically, it highlights the regions where
the invasion fitness f(x, y) is positive, represented by white
regions. From Fig. 2(a), we observe that f(x, y) > 0 holds
only for y < x, indicating that the mutant with lower in-
vestment can invade successfully. In contrast, as illustrated
in Fig. 2(b), for b/c > r∗, the condition of f(x, y) > 0 is
only satisfied when y > x. It can therefore be inferred that
investments will either evolve towards the minimum or max-
imum depending on the benefit-to-cost ratio when the benefit
function is linear.
B.
PGG with saturating benefit function
In reality, however, the assumption of linear benefit func-
tion may not be hold, as the marginal returns of collective
investments often diminish with increasing contributions [60,
