cardiovascular models typically do not account for the unique hemodynamic requirements of ocular perfusion, while
ocular models frequently overlook the dynamic effects of cardiac function. The lack of a unified modeling framework
has constrained the potential for accurate simulations of cardiovascular-ocular interactions across various physiolog-
ical states. A recent study by Caddy and co-authors [3] attempted to model large-scale arterial hemodynamics from
the heart to the eye under simulated microgravity conditions. Although this research represents a significant step
in connecting cardiovascular and ocular dynamics, it primarily focuses on arterial circulation without incorporating
closed-loop feedback mechanisms, which are vital for fully understanding the complex interactions between these
systems.
Previous work from our research group has developed theoretical models of both cardiovascular [11] and retinal
networks [10], validated against clinical and experimental data. However, these models have remained isolated from
each other. To address this limitation, we propose the development of a novel coupled Eye2Heart model. This
model will serve as a virtual laboratory to investigate the integrated dynamics of cardiovascular and retinal blood
circulation. The specific objectives of this research are twofold: (i) to develop and validate a closed-loop heart-eye
model that integrates both cardiovascular and ocular dynamics, and (ii) to simulate clinically relevant scenarios, such
as variations in IOP or changes in cardiac elastance, to explore system behavior under diverse conditions. Through
these efforts, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cardiovascular and ocular health, leading to
new insights for clinical applications and therapeutic interventions.
The remainder of the paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the mathematical framework, the assumptions under-
lying the Eye2Heart model, and the value of the parameter employed in the model for baseline simulations. Section
3 first details the validation process, comparing our baseline results with experimental and clinical data, and then
explores key simulation scenarios, including variations in IOP and heart elastance. Finally, Section 4 discusses the
implications of our findings, the limitations of the study, and directions for future research.

Model and methods
This work presents a novel closed-loop mathematical model designed to capture the intricate interplay between the
ocular and cardiovascular circulation systems. A closed-loop model is a mathematical framework that encapsulates
the interdependent feedback mechanisms between interconnected systems, ensuring that the output from one system
serves as an input to the other, thus forming a continuous cycle. This approach aims to mimic the physiological
interactions between the eye and the heart, where variations in one system can directly influence the other.
The proposed coupling is based on mathematical equations derived from fundamental physiological principles,
enabling an accurate simulation of this bidirectional relationship. In this section, we describe the development, imple-
mentation, and parameterization of the original closed-loop eye-heart model we designed, emphasizing its potential
to provide novel insights into the integrated function of these critical systems.

Closed-loop Eye2Heart model
Figure 1 illustrates the novel closed-loop Eye-Heart model, referred to as Eye2Heart hereafter. The system is
built using an analogy between fluid flow in a hydraulic network and electrical current in a circuit. In this framework,
blood pressure, blood volume, and blood flow are represented by electric potential, electric charge, and electric current,
respectively. Cardiovascular compartments, including blood vessels and heart ventricles, are modeled as combinations
of resistances (R), representing the opposition to flow that blood is experiencing when flowing through a compartment,
and compliances (C), representing the ability of that compartment to deform and store volume. By writing Kirchhoff
laws for the nodes (conservation of current/flow rate) and for closed circuits (conservation of the voltage/pressure
difference), the resulting mathematical model is a system of 23 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that capture
the dynamic interactions between the ocular and the cardiovascular circulatory systems. This structure provides a
robust foundation for analyzing and modeling the interconnected dynamics of these compartments. For clarity, the
description is divided into three parts: the cardiovascular subsystem, the ocular subsystem, and the eye-heart coupling
dynamics. To enhance the physiological interpretability of the model, the state variables and parameters have been
renamed from their original terminology, as used in previous works by Avanzolini et al. [2] and Guidoboni et al. [10].
These updates better reflect the physiological roles of the variables and parameters within the context of the integrated
model.
