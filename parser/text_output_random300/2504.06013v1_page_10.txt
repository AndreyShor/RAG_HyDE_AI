Then, near-horizon geometry is
ds2 ≈−eκ2z2dT 2 + dz2 .
(81)
One recognizes flat spacetime under the Rindler coordi-
nate transformation
t = z sinh(eκT) ,
x = z cosh(eκT) ,
(82)
where the surface gravity eκ of the static black hole plays
the role of the constant acceleration parameter. The ac-
celeration horizon is located at z = 0, corresponding to
the location of the black hole horizon in that approx-
imation.
Importantly, this implies that the properties
of the near-horizon geometry of two-dimensional static
black holes are inherited directly from the properties of
flat spacetime. Moreover, the same result holds true in
the presence of a non-trivial torsion background. This
fact is guaranteed by the covariant nature of the au-
toparallel Killing equation. Hence, let us now connect
the above results to the autoparallel Killing vectors, and,
in particular, the boost generator.
Recalling the discussion from earlier, the boost gener-
ator of flat spacetime takes the following form in Rindler
coordinates:
eK = x∂t + t∂x = 1
eκ∂T .
(83)
That is, up to a constant rescaling, the boost generator
is responsible for time translations in the Rindler time
coordinate T [23].
Introducing now outgoing (u) and
ingoing (v) null coordinates in flat spacetime,
u = t −x
√
2 ,
v = t + x
√
2 ,
(84)
the boost Killing vector eK can be written as
eK = −u∂u + v∂v .
(85)
This vector becomes null on the black hole horizon (where
t2−x2 = 0). Since the horizon itself is a null surface, this
vector can be interpreted as a generator of the horizon
[22, 23]. In particular, on the future black hole horizon
we have u = 0 and can relate the Rindler time T to the
time coordinate t of flat spacetime according to
v∂v = 1
eκ∂T .
(86)
Separating variables then leads to the relation
v = v0eeκ(T −T0) .
(87)
We may interpret this as follows: given the boost Killing
vector eK we can transform to null coordinates u and v,
consider the future horizon u = 0, and extract the surface
gravity eκ. Hence, the existence of a boost Killing vector
is sufficient to derive the basic properties of the surface
gravity of a static black hole. For this reason this presents
us with a convenient avenue to define a notion of surface
gravity in modified gravity theories purely through its
isometries (and generalizations thereof).
In the context of the present work, we focus on the two
vectors C and K, which are the torsionful generalizations
of the boost Killing vector eK in a certain sense. Let us
now explore if modified surface gravities can be defined
from these objects.

Surface gravity from the autoparallel Killing vector C
The vector Cµ is a proper Killing vector, but does not
become null at finite t or x. Moreover, in the limit of
vanishing torsion, its behavior is singular, and hence we
expect that it does not give rise to a surface gravity that
is in some sense a modified version of that from general
relativity, but rather an “additive” quantity, in the sense
that for zero torsion it approaches a universal constant
value. We recall its form in t and x coordinates,
C =
1
τ 2
0 −χ2
0
eτ0x−χ0t (τ0∂t + χ0∂x) ,
(88)
and now demand that this generates time translations in
the Rindler coordinate T as follows:
C ≡1
eκ∂T .
(89)
Converting to u and v coordinates, and setting u = 0, we
find on the future horizon that
C =

where for subsequent simplicity we defined

Integrating (and ignoring the ∂u-terms), one extracts
v(T) = −1

(92)
In analogy to Eq. (87) we now define a torsionful surface
gravity, derived from the vector field C, as the quantity
κC ≡∂v(T)

(93)
The corresponding Hawking temperature then is
TC ≡κC
2π = eκ e−∆
4π∆.
(94)
The limit of these quantities as torsion vanishes (that
is, as ∆→0) is undefined, stemming from the normal-
ization of the vector C itself. Note, however, that this
normalization of the vector was necessitated by smoothly
connecting the right hand-side of the deformed Poincar´e
algebra (60) to the flat spacetime limit.
