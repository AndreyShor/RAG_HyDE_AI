FIG. 2: A 4-simplex projected on R2. Numbers ¯1, · · · , ¯5 denote the vertices. tetraa denotes the tetrahedron
that does not contain the vertex ¯a. △ab ≡△ba denotes the triangle shared by tetraa and tetrab. The over-
and under-crossing specify the correct relative positions of vertices in each tetrahedron.

That is, π1(sk1(4-simplex)) = {{pab}a̸=b|Eqns.(5) −(6)}.
On the other hand, the fundamental group of S3\Γ5 can be computed by a generalized Wirtinger representation
[20]. It is done in the following steps. Firstly, project Γ5 onto a plane as in fig.3. Denote the nodes of Γ5 by numbers
1, · · · , 5 (with no bars) and the oriented link connecting the target node a and source node b by eab. There is one
crossing that breaks link e13 into two links, denoted as e(1)
13 for the one attached to vertex 1 and e(3)
13 for the one
attached to vertex 3, so there are totally 11 links under this projection, each is associated with a fundamental group
generator of S3\Γ5. Choose a base point b in S3\Γ5. The generator associated to eab is given by a non-contractible
closed loop lab based at b circling eab whose orientation matches that of eab. Specifically, the generators associated to
e(1)
13 and e(3)
13 respectively are denoted as l(1)
13 and l(3)
13 respectively. We associate an orientation to each lab such that

it matches the orientation of eab. Then lba = l−1

following relations, one for each node or crossing.
