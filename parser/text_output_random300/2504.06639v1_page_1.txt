This study presents calculations of rate coefficients, resonance strengths, and cross sections for the
dielectronic recombination (DR) of Y+, Sr+, Te2+, and Ce2+—low-charge ions relevant to kilonovae
and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) plasmas. Using relativistic atomic structure
methods, we computed DR rate coefficients under conditions typical of these environments. Our
results highlight the critical role of low-lying DR resonances in shaping rate coefficients at kilonova
temperatures (∼104 K) and regulating charge-state distributions. Pronounced near-threshold DR
resonances significantly influence the evolving ionization states and opacity of neutron star merger
ejecta. Comparisons with previous studies emphasize the necessity of including high-n Rydberg
states for accurate DR rate coefficients, especially for complex heavy ions with dense energy levels.
Discrepancies with existing datasets underscore the need for refined computational techniques to
minimize uncertainties. These results provide essential input for interpreting spectroscopic obser-
vations of neutron star mergers, including James Webb Space Telescope data. We also put forward
suitable candidates for experimental studies, recognizing the challenges involved in such measure-
ments. The data presented here have potential to refine models of heavy-element nucleosynthesis,
enhance plasma simulation accuracy, and improve non-LTE plasma modeling in astrophysical and
laboratory settings.

INTRODUCTION
Dielectronic recombination (DR), i.e. the capture of
a free electron via a simultaneous excitation of a bound
electron followed by radiative stabilization is an atomic
process that affects the ionization balance, radiative cool-
ing, and energy distribution in both astrophysical and
laboratory plasmas, particularly under non-local ther-
modynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions [1–9]. In
non-LTE conditions, where ionization states are not gov-
erned by local thermodynamic equilibrium, the interplay
between ionization and recombination processes like DR
is critical for determining plasma dynamics.
This im-
portance extends across a wide range of astrophysical
and laboratory plasmas, particularly in systems charac-
terized by diverse ionization states. An accurate treat-
ment of DR is crucial for improving plasma models and
interpreting observational data.
In laboratory plasmas, DR significantly influences en-
ergy loss mechanisms, contributing to radiative cooling
and the stability of high-temperature plasmas, such as
those in fusion research. The sensitivity of high Rydberg
states to weak electric fields enhances DR rates even at
low plasma densities, making it relevant to environments
like the solar corona and magnetic confinement fusion de-
vices [4]. By facilitating energy release through photon
emission, DR aids in regulating plasma temperatures and
energy distribution, critical factors for both experimental
and theoretical studies of plasma behavior.
Furthermore, DR is integral to the development of
collisional-radiative models, which describe the interac-
tions between charged particles and photons in non-LTE

plasmas [10, 11]. These models are essential for predict-
ing the response of plasmas to varying conditions, includ-
ing the effects of external fields that can modify ioniza-
tion potentials and recombination rates. By incorporat-
ing DR, these models provide insights into phenomena
such as Auger electron heating, hot electron instabili-
ties, and ionization potential depression, which are vital
for understanding plasma diagnostics and advancing non-
equilibrium plasma theory [12–14].
While DR has been extensively studied in various con-
texts, including atomic structure and isotope shifts [15–
17], its impact on kilonova-relevant ions remains an area
of active investigation. Astrophysical plasmas, particu-
larly those found in kilonovae, present extreme environ-
ments where non-LTE conditions govern the ionization
structure and radiative processes. Kilonovae are bright,
short-lived transients that occur following the merger of
neutron stars, producing heavy elements through rapid
neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. These ex-
plosions eject high-energy material into space, evolv-
ing under extreme temperatures and densities, making
them ideal laboratories for studying non-LTE plasmas.
Within such environments, DR plays a dominant role in
electron-ion recombination, significantly influencing ion-
ization balance and spectral evolution.
Due to its in-
volvement with high Rydberg states, DR is highly sen-
sitive to density effects, which govern redistributive col-
lisions before radiative stabilization occurs.
In kilono-
vae, which serve as key sites for rapid neutron-capture
(r-process) nucleosynthesis at temperatures of approxi-
mately 104 K, DR often competes with or even surpasses
radiative recombination (RR) in shaping the ionization
structure of the ejecta. Under such extreme conditions,
DR becomes the predominant recombination mechanism
for many heavy ions, surpassing RR [18]. This highlights
the critical role of DR in shaping the ionization struc-
