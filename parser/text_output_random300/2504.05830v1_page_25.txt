multi-modal heat conduction version. Specifically, modality-specific continu-
ous Frequency Value Embeddings are introduced to better accommodate the
unique characteristics of different modalities and enhance information inter-
action between multi-modal heat conduction blocks. Additionally, we also
propose a policy routing mechanism for adaptive multi-modal fusion, which
helps address the issue of imbalanced multi-modal. Furthermore, we extend
the original dataset into a bimodal version and introduce HARDVS 2.0, a
large-scale multi-modal HAR dataset, to fill the data gap in this research field.
HARDVS 2.0 contains 300 categories and includes 107,646 paired RGB-Event
video samples, covering a range of challenging attributes such as multi-view,
low-light, fast-motion, and so on. We hope that our methods and dataset will
drive progress in this area and contribute to the research community.
In our future works, we will explore how to leverage the low latency char-
acteristics of event cameras to achieve more efficient activity recognition.
Additionally, we intend to employ multi-modal large models to integrate text
and other modalities, enhancing semantic understanding.
