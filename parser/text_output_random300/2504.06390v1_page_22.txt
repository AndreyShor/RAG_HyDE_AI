phonon coupling due to favorable combinations of polarization parameter η and phonon
energy ℏωSO.
In contrast, HfO2 shows a weaker and narrower nonlinear profile, again
highlighting the limiting role of low phonon energy in shaping the polaronic effects. These
results underscore that the nonlinear refractive index offers enhanced sensitivity to substrate-
induced polaron dynamics even without an electric field, especially under moderate magnetic
fields.
With the application of an in-plane electric field (F = 0.36(b) maintains a similar quali-
tative shape to those in the zero-field case but now exhibits more pronounced spectral shifts,
especially for substrates with stronger electron-phonon coupling. The electric field enhances
carrier localization in the graphene layer, reinforcing the interaction with substrate surface
phonons and altering the effective polaronic energy levels. As a result, the resonance peaks
shift to higher photon energies for all substrates, reflecting the field-induced modulation
of the nonlinear dispersive response. The amplitude of the nonlinear refractive index does
not increase substantially with the electric field, suggesting that its influence is primarily
dispersive rather than absorptive in this context. Once again, SiO2 and SiC demonstrate
the largest field-induced shifts, while HfO2 shows minimal response due to its low ℏωSO.
These observations highlight that although the nonlinear refractive index remains smaller in
magnitude than its linear counterpart, it is more responsive to external field tuning, making
it a valuable quantity for characterizing and controlling field-sensitive optical behavior in
graphene–substrate systems.
Overall, the nonlinear refractive index displays a rich dispersive structure with alternating
positive and negative regions, reflecting the resonant enhancement and suppression of the
third-order optical susceptibility near the polaron transition energy. Compared to the linear
case (Figure 5), the shifts in the resonance features are more pronounced, especially under
stronger magnetic fields. This increased sensitivity highlights the nonlinear refractive index
as a more effective probe of the underlying polaronic dynamics and substrate interactions.
Finally, Figure 7 displays the total relative refractive index as a function of photon
