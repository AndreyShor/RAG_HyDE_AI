and Ep(S)2 is the solution of a polynomial optimization problem of five real varables which for the case
p = 1
2 can be solved analytically [270].
By combining the aforementioned correlation bounds with the entropy bounds, one can derive device-
independent bounds on conditional entropy. For instance, by integrating the BB84 bound with the CHSH
correlation bound, the bound in 121 can be obtained.
Similarly, using the asymmetric CHSH correlation bound within the BB84 noisy preprocessing framework,
the bound from [210] can be derived:
H(Aq
1|E) ≥fq(Eα(Sα)),
(123)
Moreover, by combining the CHSH correlation bound with BB84, incorporating noisy preprocessing
and bias, the following bound is obtained [270]:
H(Aq
1|E) ≥gq(|⟨A1⟩|,
p
S2/4 −1),
(124)
Finally, if we denote ˜Ep(S)2 as any lower bound on Ep(S)2, another bound can be expressed as [270]:
H(Aq
X|XE) ≥fq( ˜Ep(S)),
(125)
where ˜Ep(S) is defined as ˜Ep(S) =
q
˜Ep(S)2.
Since the obtained bounds are convex, they can be extended to give fully device-independent bounds in
arbitrary dimensions.
4.3.2. Entropy Bound for multiparty DI cryptography
Ribeiro et al. [273] and Grasselli et al. [274] extended DI protocols to multipartite scenarios by
proposing a DI conference key agreement (DI-CKA) among N parties. The security of their protocol relies
on the violation of a Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality [275–277], a generalization
of the CHSH inequality. Specifically, they focused on the three-party case involving Alice, Bob, and
Charlie. In this context, the MABK inequality is expressed as:
m = ⟨M3⟩= Tr[M3ρ]
Cl

(126)
where M3 = A0 ⊗B0 ⊗C1 + A0 ⊗B1 ⊗C0 + A1 ⊗B0 ⊗C0 −A1 ⊗B1 ⊗C1 is the MABK operator. Here,
Ax, By, and Cz represent Alice’s, Bob’s, and Charlie’s observables, respectively. A violation beyond the
GME threshold implies that the parties share a genuine multipartite entangled (GME) state.
They derived the following bound on the conditional entropy as a function of the observed MABK
violation m :

.
By proving that this bound on the conditional entropy of a party’s outcome is tight at the GME threshold,
it can be concluded that genuine multipartite entanglement is essential to ensure the privacy of a party’s
random outcome in any device-independent protocol based on the MABK inequality.
Grasselli et al. [278] advance the field by deriving tight analytical bounds on entropy as a function of the
violation of the Holz inequality, a multipartite generalization of the CHSH inequality introduced in [77].
The Holz inequality was specifically designed for DI-CKA protocols. In the tripartite case, the inequality
takes the form:
