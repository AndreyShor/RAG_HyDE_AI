by magnetic fields, showing a nearly complete 180° switching of Néel vector. We then 
reverse the direction of the in-plane magnetic field and the polarity of Hall resistance 
switching is reversed, agreeing with the SOT switching scheme29,30.  
We further study the temperature- and field-dependence of the switching performance. 
With the increase of temperature, the switching current can be reduced to 11.4 MA/cm2 at 
180 K (Figs. 3d and 3e). Besides, we quantify the SOT efficiency defined as the ratio of 
effective SOT magnetic field and current density by measuring current-induced hysteresis 
loop shift (Fig. S7). The SOT efficiency is estimated to be ~38 Oe MA-1 cm2, which is 
remarkably higher than the values reported in typical ferromagnetic systems (e.g., 6.0 Oe 
MA-1 cm2 in Pt/Fe3GaTe231 and 7.5 Oe MA-1 cm2 in Pt/Co32). By measuring the spin-Hall 
magnetoresistance (SMR) in Pt/FCGT, we reveal that the atomically sharp interface of 
Pt/FCGT produces a high spin-mixing conductance of 1.93 × 1015 Ω-1m-2, allowing spin 
currents efficiently transfer into the adjacent antiferromagnet and thus leading to a high 
SOT efficiency (Supplementary Note 6). We then vary the magnitude of the in-plane 
magnetic field, the switching current is almost unchanged (Fig. 3f). For the switching of a 
ferromagnet, the in-plane magnetic field can significantly tilt the magnetization and change 
the switching currents. By contrast, the interlayer antiparallel exchange coupling makes 
FCGT immune to external magnetic fields. We show that by altering the direction of 
currents, Néel vector can be sequentially switched, showing the reliable switching 
performance (Fig. 3g).  
Macrospin model for SOT switching in an A-type antiferromagnet 
To explain the mechanism of SOT switching of Néel vector in FCGT, we employ a 
zero-temperature macrospin model (see Supplementary Note 7) which considers an A-type 
PMA antiferromagnet with N layers. Each antiferromagnet layer experiences current-
induced SOTs: 𝑯𝑯𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒

magnetic field and the direction of spin polarization. We neglect the spin current decay as 
the spin diffusion length in an antiferromagnet is usually longer than the thickness of our 
flakes33,34. In addition, each antiferromagnet layer experiences the external magnetic field
