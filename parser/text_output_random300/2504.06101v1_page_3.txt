y (x) = 2ty cos (2kF x/l) with the period πl/kF equal
to the period of the magnetic field B(l)
τν(x), and with ty
being a non-negative constant. In general, the main re-
sults of the paper remain valid for other forms of tunnel-
ing amplitudes and magnetic field, including potentially
more experimentally feasible forms, as long as they have
a substantial Fourier component at 2kF /l. The spin de-
pendence of the tunneling processes can be realized by
placing nanomagnets to polarize the medium between the
wires or via intrinsic magnetic ordering. As a result, only
spin-up (spin-down) electrons are allowed to tunnel be-
tween neighboring wires of the same unit cell (in adjacent
unit cells); see Fig. 2.
Finally, we add the tunneling processes along the z
direction.
The first term couples neighboring wires in
adjacent unit cells:

Hereinafter we omit the position argument of the field
operators for brevity.
The magnitudes of the tunnel-
ing amplitudes are spatially modulated as t(l)
zν(x) =
2tzν cos (2kF x/l) and ˜t(l)
zν(x) = 2˜tzν cos (2kF x/l), where
tzν and ˜tzν are non-negative constants depending on ν.
The total Hamiltonian of our model H(l) is given by
the sum of all terms described above:
H(l) = H0 + H(l)

In Secs. III and IV, we explicitly demonstrate that this
model can realize various 3D SOTI phases with a fully
gapped bulk and fully gapped surfaces, but gapless chiral
hinge states with total charge el that propagate along a
closed path of hinges.
B.
Alternative model based on SOI
In the rest of the paper, we focus on the model with the
Hamiltonian H(l) described in the previous subsection.
However, as was mentioned above, this model is math-
ematically equivalent to an alternative model in which
the helical magnetic fields are replaced by the interplay
between SOI and uniform magnetic fields. We thus con-
sider Rashba nanowires with strong SOI in this subsec-
tion. The Rashba SOI leads to an additional term in the
Hamiltonian:

where α parametrizes the strength of the SOI. This term
sets the spin quantization axis along the z direction and
has a sign determined by τν ∈{1, ¯1}. The kinetic part
H0, combined with the SOI term HSOI, results in the
energy spectrum of infinitely long wires in the form:
Eτνσ = k2
x
2m0
+ (τνσ)αkx −µ(l).
(10)
Here, the chemical potential is tuned to the value µ(l) =
Eso(l2 −1), with Eso = k2
so/(2m0) being the spin-orbit
energy, and kso = m0α the spin-orbit momentum. The
new Fermi wave vectors satisfy k(l)
F ± = kso(1 ± l).
Next, we introduce uniform magnetic fields with an
amplitude M applied along the wires. These magnetic
fields are oriented in opposite directions for wires with
different τ such that the total magnetization is equal to
zero. The corresponding Zeeman term reads

where ∆M = βM. The tunneling terms remain the same
as in the previous subsection II A, but the tunneling am-
plitudes now have periods independent of l, specifically
π/(2kso). The model described here is mathematically
equivalent to the model based on rotating magnetic fields
(see Sec. II A) and can therefore also host integer and
fractional chiral hinge states in the exact same way; for
more details see Appendix A.

INTEGER CHIRAL HINGE STATES
A.
Single hinge state regime
In this section, we demonstrate that the model defined
in Eq. (8) realizes a SOTI phase in a certain region of
parameter space. Here, we focus on the case of integer l,
which leads to hinge states that carrying integer charge,
while the case of fractionally charged hinge states will
be discussed further below in Sec. IV. For simplicity, we
start with the single-state regime characterized by the
parameter l = 1.
For now, let us assume that the system is infinite along
the x axis, but has a finite number of unit cells Ny and
Nz in the y and z directions, respectively. To demon-
strate that the system can realize a SOTI phase, we fo-
cus on the parameter regime µ ≫∆B ≫ty ≫tz1, ˜tz¯1 ≫
