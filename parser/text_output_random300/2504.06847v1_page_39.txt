Fig. 15. Stereographic projection of collinear SHG phase matching loci in crystals of 2-
AmpH2PO3 for selected wavelengths of the fundamental wave. Type I phase matching is 
indicated by red colour, type II phase matching by blue colour. The directions 
0
ie  are the 
directions of the principal axes of the optical indicatrix of 2-AmpH2PO3.
