case, we can compare the noisy outcomes of the hardware with the corre-
sponding ideal output. Let the ideal and noisy outputs be Ym ∈{0, 1}s and
ˆYm ∈{0, 1}s, where s is the number of measured qubits and m = 1, . . . , Mshots
indexes a single execution (shot) of the quantum machine.1 Ym and ˆYm can
only take binary real values because a qubit collapses into a {0, 1} when it
is measured. When s qubits of a circuit are measured the noisy and ideal
outputs are a series of binary strings, interpreted as i.i.d. draws from two
underlying multivariate distributions, PY and P ˆY , with support {0, 1}s. As
the noisy device and the classical simulator run independently, there is no
relationship between single samples from PY and P ˆY . For simplicity, we use
the same index for the samples from ˆPY and P ˆY , even if a realization of
Ym is not the label of a realization of ˆYm. In this setup, hardware noise is
proportional to any distribution distance between PY and P ˆY .
The fidelity of two quantum states is a quantification of their similarity,
defined as the probability of identifying one state as the other. Its classical
counterpart, for discrete random variables, is the Bhattacharyya Coefficient
(Bhattacharyya, 1946),
BC(Y, ˆY ) =
X
y∈Y

PY (y)P ˆY (y)

The BC is related to the Hellinger distance,

H(Y, ˆY ) = 1

and the Total Variation distance,

In particular, 1 −BC = d2

Inequalities involving the
Kullback–Leibler divergence, dKL = EP ˆY log PY
P ˆY , can be found in (Sason,
2015).
1Y1, . . . , YM and ˆY1, . . . , ˆYM should be treated as random variables because of the in-
trinsic Quantum Mechanics non-determinism.
