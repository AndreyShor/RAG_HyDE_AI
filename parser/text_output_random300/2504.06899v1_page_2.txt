2| ≤ϵ, where e
represents any knowledge about si that the adversary
may possess. This is a striking result since the source
has a straightforward structure. It is a mixture of certain
permutations of an iid Bernoulli distribution biased by ϵ
around { 1
2, 1
2} distribution [6].
On the other hand, private randomness, an early
recognized quantum resource [1], arises from quantum
mechanical axioms guaranteeing randomness in specific
measurement outcomes.
Renner and Colbeck’s break-
through [7] defied the Santha-Vazirani limitation, reveal-
ing a method to overcome it utilizing statistically inde-
pendent quantum devices decoupled from the weak ran-
domness source. Optimizing this process produced prac-
tical protocols using only two devices [8, 9].
Two primary models underpin private randomness:
the Santha-Vazirani source, previously mentioned, and
the Hmin source [10]. Our focus is on estimating the pri-
vacy level of weakly private randomness, assuming that
it conforms to the Santha-Vazirani source. However, our
developed software could be easily modified to estimate
the Hmin source as well. Notably, recent advances have
employed heuristic modeling to characterize heartbeat
signals as Santha-Vazirani sources [11].
In this article, we go beyond these results in two ways.
Firstly, we provide the axioms that any function estimat-
ing a parameter ϵ should satisfy. Secondly, we focus on a
different physical source, a more efficient one, that of the
(i) Earthquakes and (ii) Earth vibrations (seismic noise).
Our approach further develops the technique of attribut-
ing ϵ to a sequence of bits and goes beyond the limita-
tions of the low amount of data that the human heart
can generate within a day. We base this on the plausi-
ble assumption that local and global Earth’s vibrations
are primarily unpredictable.
We then note that tech-
niques for privatizing such a priori unpredictable source
using quantum devices are known [12]. We also provide
open-source software that enables the estimation of the
parameter ϵ for an input sequence of bits.

Private randomness amplification—previous
works
This section presents the background for the problem
of randomness amplification and the history of results
in this domain compactly, based on the comprehensive
review [13].
Let us first observe that generating randomness using
a quantum device is straightforward when we trust its
inner workings. Preparing a quantum bit (qubit) in the
equal superposition |+⟩:= 1/
√
2(|0⟩+|1⟩) and measuring
it in the computational basis enables the generation of
random outputs.
Indeed, the Born rule [14] dictates unbiased outcomes
for these measurements:
1
2 : |0⟩and
1
2 : |1⟩.
How-
ever, trusting random number generators (RNGs) re-
mains questionable. An eavesdropper might have mod-
ified the devices during manufacturing, leading them
to exhibit predictable behavior advantageous to an ad-
versary in collaboration with the manufacturer.
The
history of successful attacks on classical RNGs is well-
documented, particularly following the seminal Trojan
hardware attack [15]. Based on altering the dopant level
of three transistors within the RNG circuit, the attack
introduces a subtle modification to the overall structure,
rendering it challenging to detect while compromising the
security of randomness.
One of the possible solutions employs quantum device-
independent private random number generators relying
on a short but secure uniformly random seed called
(quantum) private randomness expansion [16–19]. The
seed enables the selection of inputs to the device(s) while
subsequent outputs undergo processing via quantum-
proof extractors. Upon the violation of a Bell inequality
[20]—an assessment of the inputs and outputs of a de-
vice surpassing a predetermined threshold—the involved
parties ascertain that the resulting larger output string
maintains both uniformity and remains undisclosed to
potential adversaries.
Furthermore, the application scope of device certifica-
tion via Bell violations has expanded significantly. This
approach not only validates the randomness of quan-
tum RNGs [17, 21] and secures QKD in quantum com-
munication [13, 22] but also proves properties of a de-
vice, such as privacy of randomness based solely on the
statistics of inputs and outputs of the device, facilitat-
ing device-independent quantum information processing
[23]. Moreover, it ensures the integrity of quantum net-
works [24, 25], verifies quantum measurements [26, 27],
and guarantees fidelity in quantum computing [28]. Ad-
ditionally, it explores fundamental physics [29] and vali-
dates quantum computational advantages [30]. The com-
prehensive nature of Bell violations certification spans
numerous applications in quantum technology, ensuring
robust security, reliability, and trust.
Here, it’s noteworthy to recognize that the adversary’s
limitations could arise from quantum mechanics, defining
a quantum adversary, or from the inherent impossibility
of super-luminal signaling, defining a non-signaling ad-
versary. Researchers have explored setups for generating
private randomness in both of these contexts [31–34].
Furthermore, extractors are functional applications
[35–37], separating the function’s output from the ad-
versary’s memory—a repository encompassing all con-
ceivable knowledge (refer to [1, 13] for comprehensive re-
views). However, this solution poses a critical challenge,
as it necessitates a perfectly random and secure seed, a
requirement lacking practical justification.
This problem, however, was resolved by the idea of
quantum private randomness amplification, on develop-
ing which we focus in this manuscript. According to this
approach, the honest parties have access to a source of
weakly secure random bits (the Santha-Vazirani or, in
general, Hmin source). The inputs to the quantum de-
vice(s) employ these seeds, and the resultant outputs,
