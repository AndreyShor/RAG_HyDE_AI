TABLE I: Reference thermal history simulations used in this work. A complete list, including all thermal history runs, can be found in Table I
of [46]. The columns include the box size ([ℎ−1 cMpc]), the number of particles, the end of reionisation redshift, the thermal parameters 𝑇0
and 𝑢0 at redshift 𝑧= 4.6, the inverse of the WDM mass 𝑚WDM−1, and the additional dark matter parameter, the fraction of WDM particle
mass 𝑓WDM. The first two rows list the main simulations: one with fiducial CAMB initial conditions (as in [46], [92]) and the other using the
CLASS code ([93]). The last row contains the fiducial simulation for mass resolution correction. Box correction runs match those in [46].
Note that the simulations in all three rows extend to 𝑚WDM = 1 keV, with the first set covering CWDM models. Different CWDM models listed
in this table were run for all 12 thermal histories of [46].

FIG. 2: Left: Linear matter power spectrum at 𝑧= 0 computed using the Boltzmann solver CLASS for CDM (black), a CWDM model (blue)
and pure WDM model (red). The last two correspond to the 2𝜎bounds found when fixing the highest 𝑓WDM ( 𝑓WDM = 1) and lowest 𝑚WDM
(𝑚WDM = 1 keV) in our analysis. We also present a range of CWDM models, shown in blue with varying line styles, which are drawn from
the region of power suppression of allowed models. These models delineate the 2𝜎allowed region, represented by the blue shaded area. The
region of rejected models is shown in gray. Right: The matter transfer function (𝑇2(𝑘)) from random samples of the 2D posterior distribution
in the (𝑚WDM−1 −𝑓WDM) plane inside (outside) the 2𝜎contour in blue (gray). We highlight five allowed models in color, highlighting that
we are sensitive to both the CWDM departure scale from CDM (mainly set by 𝑚WDM) and the suppression amplitude (dependent on 𝑓WDM).
Notably, lower 𝑚WDM values can be constrained at the cost of reduced suppression at higher-𝑘.
highlight the primary effect of dark matter free-streaming on
structure formation. As 𝑚WDM decreases in these pure WDM
models, the free-streaming length increases. This results in
the smoother filamentary structure observed in the Figure.
Notably, this smoothing effect is more pronounced for the
𝑚WDM = 1 keV model compared to the 𝑚WDM = 3 keV model.
A.
Imprint of mixed dark matter models on the matter power
spectrum
The initial conditions for WDM and CWDM simulations
differ from those of CDM in the computation of the power spec-
trum. The free-streaming effect, 𝜆fs, is incorporated through a
transfer function, 𝑇(𝑘), that modifies the original power spec-
trum, (e.g. [96]). Specifically, the power spectra for CDM and
pure warm thermal relic models are computed using the Boltz-
mann solver CAMB [92], while for the latter cosmology, we
apply the transfer function from [96–98]. The mixed models
are generated using the in-built CLASS option, which accounts
for the temperature, mass, and density of non-cold dark matter
[93, 99]. To ensure consistency across different cosmologies
simulated with different codes, we correct for minor discrep-
ancies by taking the ratio of the flux power spectrum between
CDM models computed with CAMB and CLASS (see Table I).
In the context of CWDM models, the transfer function
asymptotically approaches a constant plateau at small scales.
The height of this plateau is primarily determined by the warm
dark matter (WDM) fraction, 𝑓WDM, due to the presence of a
dominant CDM component. The characteristic cut-off scale
is governed by the mass of the warm dark matter counterpart,
similar to the behavior observed in pure WDM models.
Figure 2 shows on the left the linear matter power spectrum
for CDM at 𝑧= 0, along with the 2𝜎lower bound on pure
WDM and on a mixed model with 𝑚WDM = 1 keV. The latter
is the lightest thermal relic allowed in our analysis. We further
show models with progressively heavier warm counterparts
(and correspondingly smaller fractions), which bracket the
2𝜎allowed region found in this work, shaded in blue. This
Figure illustrates the imprint of CWDM in the matter power
spectrum: the scale at which it deviates from CDM is set
by 𝑚WDM while the suppression depends on the abundance
