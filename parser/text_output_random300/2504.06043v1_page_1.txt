Abstract
In this section different theoretical approaches towards multi-quark states are introduced, namely hadrocharmonia, compact tetraquarks
and hadronic molecules. The predictions derived from either of them are contrasted with current and possible future observations.
The focus is on doubly heavy systems, but singly heavy and light systems are mentioned briefly as well.
Keywords: Exotic hadrons, multi-quarks, hadronic molecules
