SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 7: RHOMBOHEDRAL TRILAYER ON A HALF-CRYSTAL
Supplementary Figure 8. Junction states of a rhombohedral trilayer on a rhombohedral half-
crystal. In the top panel, no electric field is applied to the heterostructure. We use the same colour
scheme as used in Fig. 4 of the main text. In the bottom panel, for comparison, we show the results from
the main text for an out-of-plane electric field E0 such that eE0c = 0.1Î³1.
