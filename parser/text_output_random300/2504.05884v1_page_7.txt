FIG. 7: By simulating the ODMR spectra of an imperfect
[100] alignment with 500 kHz and 5 MHz broadened
peaks, the overall shape and therefore the signal response
due to external fields changes. (a) The simulated ODMR

magnet on the sensor head (Fig. 7a). The ODMR with
the 5 MHz line width was first generated and then a mea-
surement point at the zero-crossing resonance frequency of
the first peak was chosen. An applied test field along each
of the three magnetic field axes of -100 µT to 100 µT was
applied and the change in signal at the zero-crossing point
was measured (Fig. 7b). Sweeping the By component, for
example, is dramatically different for the broad single peak
compared to the many unbroadened peaks.
These changes in signal response due to the difference
in modulation amplitude are most likely the reason for the
difference between the two sets of data, becoming the most
dominant effect over the increase in signal strength due to
the addition of an extra magnet.
Appendix D: Sensitivity
To determine the sensitivity of the magnetometer, three
fast-Fourier-transforms (FFTs) were measured while the
microwave frequency was set to the zero-crossing point of
the central peak of the left-hand side group of peaks (the
ms = −1 transition peaks) in the ODMR spectrum. The
FFTs were taken using a PicoScope 5442D at a sampling

FIG. 8: The average amplitude spectral density from the
fast-Fourier-transforms (FFT) of three time traces that
each lasted 16 minutes and 20 seconds. The red dashed

rate of 1 kHz. The measured signal was amplified by 500
times by the lock-in amplifier before going into the Pico-
Scope.
The average of the three FFTs was used to de-
termine the average noise value between 0.5 and 10 Hz
as shown in Fig.8. 10 Hz was the upper limit as a low-
pass filter with a 3 dB point of 10 Hz was used to reduce
noise. Each FFT was taken with a rectangular window ap-
plied. This average value in units of dBu was converted
to volts by V = Vref × 10dBu/20 with the reference voltage
Vref = 0.775 V. This unit of voltage was then converted
to units of nT using the gradient of the chosen ODMR
peak and the gyromagnetic ratio for the NV centre. The
gradient of the peak was measured using a linear fit to be
approximately 0.22 V/MHz and the gyromagnetic ratio of
the NV centre is know to be 28 GHz/T. These two units
then give a calibration constant of 6.16×10−6 V/nT. Using
this calibration constant, the average FFT value was found
to be 12.3 ± 4.1 nT/Hz1/2 between 0.5 and 10 Hz. This was
taken to be the unshielded sensitivity of the magnetometer.
