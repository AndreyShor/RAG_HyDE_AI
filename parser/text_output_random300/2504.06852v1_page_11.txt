FIG. 7: The effect of topological property on magnon
spin photoconductivity in ferromagnetic Kagome
lattice. Here, we take S = 1, J = 1 meV, and
gJµBBz = −3 meV. (a) Chern number curve with D of
different bands. (b) Topological phase diagram with
regions characterized by Chern number set (C0, C1, C2),
where the horizontal coordinate represents D and the
vertical coordinate represents exchange interaction J.
Here, the set of the red area is (C0, C1, C2) = (1, 0, −1),
and the set of the blue area is (C0, C1, C2) = (−1, 0, 1).
(c) Magnon spin photoconductivity curve with D under
different temperature. (d) Magnon spin
photoconductivity with D and exchange interaction J,
in which the temperature T = 20 K.
Because Bose distribution f B(ε) = 1/(eε/kBT −1) in-
creases with the decrease of energy ε, the magnitude of
magnon spin photoconductivity increase as the decrease
of the lowest band (the band that makes a major con-
tribution to the magnon spin photoconductivity) accord-
ing to Eq. 40. Therefore, when D/J >
√
3, different
from the case of D/J <
√
3, the magnitude of magnon
spin photoconductivity increases dramatically with the
increasing of D. This is shown more intuitively in Fig.
7 (b) and (c). In Fig. 7 (b), the Chern number set of
the red area is (1, 0, −1), the Chern number set of the
blue area is (−1, 0, 1). And the topological phase tran-
sition occurs on the line D/J =
√
3. In Fig. 7 (c), in
the region where the Chern number set is (1, 0, −1), the
magnon spin photoconductivity changes little with J and
D; when the Chern number set is (1, 0, −1), the magni-
tude of magnon spin photoconductivity increase with the
increasing of D/J.
For Kagome lattice, magnon energy photoconductivity
can not be expressed by Berry curvature. Therefore, it is
difficult to discuss the magnon energy photoconductivity
of the Kagome lattice through the topological property
of the system. So we do not discuss about the magnon
energy photoconductivity of Kagome under the condition
of low optical frequency and Γ = 0 in this work.

Next we discuss the magnon spin (energy) photocon-
ductivity in Lu2V2O7.
Here, we do not consider the
three-dimensional structure of Lu2V2O7, we treat the sys-
tem as a stack of non-interaction layers34,35,40,66. The
Curie temperature of Lu2V2O7 is 70 K34,66. In addition,
Lu2V2O7 satisfies a = 0.7024 nm, S =
1
2, J = 3.405
meV and D/J = 0.3234,40,66.
Here, we take the tem-
perature as 50 K. And we assume the magnon life-
time to be of the order of τ ≈1 picosecond (10−12
s)42.

FIG. 8: The longitudinal magnon spin
photoconductivity (a), transverse magnon spin
photoconductivity (b), the longitudinal magnon energy
photoconductivity (c) and the transverse magnon
energy photoconductivity (d) of Lu2V2O7. Here, ω is

range that we calculate, the transverse magnon photo-
transport of Lu2V2O7 is stronger than the longitudinal
magnon photo-transport. The magnon photo-transport
reaches its peak in the frequency range of approximately
0.03 × 1013 rad/s to 5 × 1013 rad/s, and then turn to
stabilize. In this optical frequency range, the magnitude
of transverse magnon spin photoconductivity can reach
the scale of 10−9e(nm)2, when we apply a light with the
electric field E0,y ∼1V/nm, the MSPC can reach the
scale of jx ∼10−6(meV )(nm). And the magnitude of
transverse magnon energy photoconductivity can reach
103e(nm2)/s, when we apply a light with the electric
field E0,y ∼10−6V/nm, the MEPC can reach the scale
of jE
x ∼1(meV )(nm)/s.
