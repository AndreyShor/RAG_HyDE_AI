Figure 3: Comparison of the mean Rosseland opacity proﬁles of reference evolutionary
models, seismic reconstruction and the updated theoretical computations associated with
the thermodynamical paths of both models. Left panel: Opacity proﬁles from evolution-
ary computations with the 2015 OPAS tables (brown-plain line), from seismic reconstruction
(orange-plain line), and from detailed computations with the OPAS code for both evolutionary
and seismic thermodynamical paths (brown and orange dashed lines, respectively), using the
AGSS09 abundances. Right panel: Opacity proﬁles for evolutionary computations using OPAL
tables (brown-plain line), from seismic reconstruction (orange-plain line) and from detailed
SCO-RCG computations for both evolutionary and seismic thermodynamical paths (brown and
orange dashed lines, respectively), using the AAG21 abundances. Source Data provided with
this paper.
