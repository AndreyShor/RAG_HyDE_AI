 Edge generation: In (a) market, (b) power, and (c) gift economies, two nodes 
are randomly selected from the node list at each step, and two directed edges are 
generated between those nodes. In (d) the concession economy, to match the edge 
generation speed with other economic modes, two pairs of nodes were randomly 
selected at each step, and one directed edge was generated for each pair. 
 Edge deletion: If we continued to generate edges, all economic modes would 
approach a complete graph, and the differences in their properties would disappear. 
Therefore, a mean degree (or total degree = number of nodes × mean degree) was set, 
and an edge was deleted if the mean degree of the graph exceeds the set degree. The 
failure of exchange was simulated in (a) the market and (b) power economies, and the 
failure of reciprocity was simulated in (c) the gift economy, and the edges were deleted 
randomly. In (d), the concession economy oblivion is simulated over time, and the 
oldest edges were deleted first. 
Based on the above, Fig 2 shows the calculation flow of the network models 
corresponding to the four economic modes. For the flow of (a) the market economy on 
the far left, calculations can be made by following the branch shown by the dotted lines 
for (b) power, (c) gift, and (d) concession economies. In the initial setting, the number 
of nodes 𝑛, the mean degree 𝑘𝜇, the maximum number of steps 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥, and the graph 
𝑔(1) at 𝑡= 1 are set. 𝑔(1) is a graph with no edges (the adjacency matrix is zero). 
At step 𝑡 in the calculation flow, for each of the four economic modes, the selection 
from the node list, the rewriting of the node list (in the case of (a) market and (b) power 
economies), and the generation of edges, the deletion of edges (if the mean degree 
exceeds 𝑘𝜇), and the drawing of the graph 𝑔(𝑡) are sequentially performed. These 
steps are repeated until the number of steps reaches 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥.
