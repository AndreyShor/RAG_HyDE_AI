Figure A3. (Left): Two initial conditions (heavy dots, crosses) for |Ψ⟩n on two neighboring transverse
necklaces attached to the even and odd longitudinal sites 2k (blue) and 2k + 1 (red), respectively. Only
the transverse positions (drawn vertically, ranging in [−3, +3]) of the single up spins are marked; all
others are down. (Middle): Update of the initial state by the scattering operator
ˆ
M(k), Equation (22),
gives the intermediate result |Ψ⟩′n. Note that the blue cross has felt the periodic boundary condition in
the vertical direction, according to −2 + (−3) ≡+2. (Right): To obtain the final result of the one-step
update, |Ψ⟩n+1, the up spins at even and odd longitudinal positions have to move two positions to
the right and left, respectively.
