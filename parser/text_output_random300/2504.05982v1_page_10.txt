of ∼100 ns and a COV of ∼1.46. Sharp resetting accelerates this process by an order of

Combining resetting with MetaD
Resetting leads to substantial acceleration for entropic barriers, but is not always suﬃcient
as a standalone method. It is less eﬃcient for high enthalpic barriers in narrow basins, such
that the FPT distribution is exponential. Most enhanced sampling methods are particularly
designed to tackle such cases but, while being very successful, they have other drawbacks.
Combining them with Resetting can compensate for these drawbacks, and lead to higher
acceleration than either approach separately, as we explain below for the example of MetaD.
MetaD accelerates slow processes by introducing an external bias potential along chosen
