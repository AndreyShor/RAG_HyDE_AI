Supplementary Figure 1: Heavy element mass fraction proﬁle (Z) as a function of normalized
radius r/R⊙in the radiative zone of a reference model and its seismic counterpart (here taken for
Model 5 that includes macroscopic transport at the BCZ and the OPLIB opacities as reference
radiative opacities in the calibration).
when accounting for planetary formation, accretion, and mass loss. Attempting to replicate solar
neutrino ﬂux observations may prove challenging, given the potential impact of evolutionary
history on model predictions96. As demonstrated below, our results remain insensitive to events
within the solar core.
The optimization is carried out with a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and converges after
about 5 iterations on a parametric proﬁle reproducing the solar luminosity within 0.1%. The
Levenberg-Marquardt method uses as constraints the luminosity proﬁle of the reference model
between 0.1 and 0.3R⊙on about 30 points. Fitting directly the nuclear energy generation rate,
ǫ(ρ, T, X, Z), also allows to recover accurately the opacity proﬁle.
Once the luminosity proﬁle is recovered, we compute the mean Rosseland opacity, κ, from the
radiative transfer equation
