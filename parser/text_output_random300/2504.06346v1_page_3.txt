Introduction
The B0
s →ϕℓ+ℓ−decays, where ℓrepresents an electron, a muon or a tau lepton, proceed
through a b- to s-quark flavour-changing neutral-current transition.
Such processes
are suppressed in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. The rate and angular
distribution of these decay can be modified in many SM extensions, with distinct effects
possible in final states involving different lepton flavours. Interestingly, measurements of
a variety of decays involving b→sℓ+ℓ−transitions are found to be in tension with SM
predictions. The largest discrepancies between measurements and predictions are seen
in the rates of B →Kµ+µ−[1–3] and B0
s →ϕµ+µ−[4] decays, as well as in the rate and
angular distribution of B0 →K∗0µ+µ−decays [5–12]. Unfortunately, the interpretation
of these discrepancies is complicated by long-distance contributions to the decay rate,
which are difficult to estimate reliably in the SM (see for example Refs. [13,14]). Such
contributions do not impact comparisons between decays to different lepton flavours and
significant discrepancies between measurements of observables in dielectron and dimuon
final states would indicate a breakdown of the SM.
The
consistency
between
the
rates
of
the
B(+,0) →K(+,∗0)µ+µ−
and
B(+,0) →K(+,∗0)e+e−decays has been studied extensively in recent years.1
Mea-
surements of the rates of decays to dielectron and dimuon final states are found to
be compatible [15, 16], showing a similar pattern of tensions with SM predictions,
consistent with universal couplings to the different lepton flavours. The results of a
study of the angular distributions of B0 →K∗0e+e−decays are also in agreement with
similar measurements of the B0 →K∗0µ+µ−final state [5, 17]. A recent study of the
B0
s →ϕe+e−decay rate in bins of dilepton mass squared, q2, likewise found consistent
values with those measured in B0
s →ϕµ+µ−decays [18]. A separate study of the angular
distribution of the B0
s →ϕe+e−decay with q2 in the range [0.0009, 0.2615] GeV2/c4,
obtained results compatible with SM predictions [19]. It is therefore of interest to study
angular observables in B0
s →ϕe+e−decays at higher q2 values, to test whether they
are consistent with SM predictions and with the measurements made in B0
s →ϕµ+µ−
decays [20].
This paper describes the first angular analysis of the B0
s →ϕe+e−decay in the q2 ranges
[0.1, 1.1], [1.1, 6.0] and [15.0, 19.0] GeV2/c4. The q2 range [6.0, 15.0] GeV2/c4 is dominated
by contributions from B0
s →J/ψϕ and B0
s →ψ(2S)ϕ decays, involving b→ccs quark-level
transitions. This q2 range is used as a control region for the analysis. The results presented
in this paper are based on a proton-proton collision dataset, corresponding to 9 fb−1 of
integrated luminosity, collected with the LHCb detector between 2011 and 2018. Since
the final state of this decay is not flavour specific, the notation B0
s →ϕe+e−is used to
refer to the sum of both B0
s and B0
s meson decays to the same final state.
The angular distribution of the B0
s →ϕe+e−decay, where the ϕ meson decays to K+K−,
can be parametrised by three decay angles: the angle θK between the K+ direction and
the direction opposite that of the B0
s meson in the ϕ meson rest frame; the angle θe
between the e+ direction and the direction opposite that of the B0
s meson in the dielectron
rest frame; and the angle Φ between the decay planes of the ϕ meson and dielectron pair
in the rest frame of the B0
s meson. The angles are illustrated in Fig. 1. The decay-time-
dependent angular distribution of the decay is described in Sec. 2, following the formalism
1The symbols K∗and ϕ are used to refer to the K∗(892) and ϕ(1020) mesons, respectively, throughout
the paper.
