This is by definition the highest contribution to ΩPBH, and thus serves as an upper bound
on the mass fraction of PBH. It is shown in Fig. 7 in green for the case when (B.10) is
valid, that is, when the Gaussian peak is above σk > 1, and shows also good agreement
with the numerical solution. In short, the maximum abundance of PBH for our model can
be estimated as follows

where we have substituted the power spectrum of SIGWs (4.4) and the power spectrum
of PBH density fluctutations (3.26). Further, we consider g(k, teva) ≃1 for the modes of
interest. We give now analytical estimations of (C.1) to understand the dependence of
