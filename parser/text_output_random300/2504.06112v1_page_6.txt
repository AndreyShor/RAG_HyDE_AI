and SDG, with the following payoff matrices:
Q =

R S
T P

, T = b (1 < b ≤2), R = 1, P = 0, S = ±σ (0 ≤σ ≤1).
(1)
In the PDG, the parameters are given by R = 1, P = 0, T = b (1 ≤b ≤2), and S = −σ
(0 < σ ≤1). The SDG parameters are rescaled such that S = +σ (0 < σ ≤1), while the
other values remain unchanged. These can be represented as:
Q1 =

1 −σ
b
0

, Q2 =

1 +σ
b
0

.

According to previous research [44], the relationship between parameters is given by:
Dg = T −R, Dr = P −S, D
′
g =
Dg
R −P , D
′
r =
Dr
R −P .
(3)
From (1), (2), and (3), it follows that Dg = D
′
g = b −1 > 0 and Dr = D

r = ±σ. When
σ = 0, all players participate in a weak PDG, marking the boundary between PDG and
SDG. When σ ̸= 0, both PDG and SDG coexist in the system [45].
At the initial stage, each agent is allocated one unit of resources. Each player adopts
either a cooperative (Sx) or defective (Sy) strategy with equal probability, expressed as:
Sx = (1, 0)⊤, Sy = (0, 1)⊤.

The system evolves through a standard discrete-time asynchronous Monte Carlo simula-
tion, consisting of the following steps:
1. Game stage. Following typical Glauber dynamics, a player i is randomly selected and
obtains a payoff pi by engaging in games with its four nearest neighbors, regardless of
their game type. This is given by:
pi =
X
j∈Ω(i)
SiQTiSj,
(5)
where Ω(i) denotes the set of neighboring individuals of i, whose cardinality is just
the agent’s degree |Ω(i)| = ki = 4, and QTi is the payoff matrix corresponding to the
individual i’s game type.
