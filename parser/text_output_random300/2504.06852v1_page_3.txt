(8)
Here, ρ(α)
mn(k, t) is the αth-order correction of density ma-
trix. vmn(k) and vE
mn(k) are the matrix element of ve-
locity and energy velocity in the Bloch representation
respectively.
1.
The matrix element of velocity and energy velocity in
Bloch representation
According to Appendix D, the matrix element of
magnon velocity is
vmn(k) = 1
iℏ{i∂kεn(k)δmn + Amn(k)εnm(k)} ,
(9)
and magnon energy velocity is
vE(k) =
1
2iℏ[εm(k) + εn(k)] {i∂kεn(k)δmn + Amn(k)εnm(k)} ,
(10)
in which εn(k) is the energy of band and Amn(k) =
⟨um(k)| i∂k |un(k)⟩is Berry connection.

The correction of density matrix in Bloch representation

τ , in which τ is the relaxation time of
magnon46,47,64.
We assume that the time-dependent
electric field starts at t = 0, and the effect of scatter-
ing on magnons is not considered when t < 0.
And
ρ(0) = ρ(t = 0) is the equilibrium density matrix, which
satisfies ∂tˆρ(0) = 0.
By solving quantum Liouville equation (detail see Ap-
pendix C), in interaction picture, the first order density
matrix is

magnon density matrix can be expressed as ρ(1)
mn(k, t) =
ρ(1)i
mn (k, t) + ρ(1)e
mn (k, t) in Bloch representation, in which
ρ(1)i
mn (k, t) is the intraband part of the first-order density
matrix, and ρ(1)e
mn (k, t) is the interband part of the first-
order density matrix. The expression of ρ(1)i
mn (k, t) and
ρ(1)e
mn (k, t) is Eq. C12 in Appendix C.

The zero-order magnon transport
We substitute the zero-order density matrix into Eq. 7
and Eq. 8 to obtain the zero-order magnon spin current
