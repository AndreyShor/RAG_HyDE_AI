and where the function ab is defined as in (2.2). In particular, the field Φb is shift invariant in the
sense that τxΦb has the same law as Φb for every x ∈Rd. Then, by applying the Cameron–Martin
theorem (see Lemma C.1), we have that for all F : C(Rd) →R and y ∈Rd, it holds that

(5.8)
We observe that the integral over x inside the expectation in (5.8) is bounded above by a positive finite
constant. Indeed, since the function F is bounded by assumption and the exponential terms are easily
bounded, it suffices to verify that
Z

1{Υb(x)≥Mx,b(Υb)−λ}

Bk(x) 1{Υb(y)≥My,b(Υb)−λ}dy dx < ∞.
To simplify the notation, we introduce the set Aλ
def= {x ∈Rd : Υb(x) ≥Mx,b(Υb) −λ}. We note
that there exist a positive number σd that depends only on d and points {z1, . . . zσd} ⊆Rd, such
that Bk ⊆∪σd
i=1B(zi, ek/2). Consequently, this implies that the quantity on the left-hand side of the
previous expression is bounded above by

We now want to take the limit as b →∞in the expectation in (5.8) by applying Theorems A and B.
However, the function that assigns to Υb the quantity inside the expectation in (5.8) is not a function
in Cb
loc(C(Rd)). In order to overcome this issue, we proceed in three steps.
Step 1: We can choose 0 < k ≤j ≤b sufficiently large such that for all x ∈Bk and all y ∈Bk(x)
the following inclusions hold
Bj ⊆Bb ⊆B2b ,
Bj ⊆Bb(x) ⊆B2b ,
Bj ⊆Bb(y) ⊆B2b .
In particular, this implies that on the event {M0,2b(Υb) = M0,j(Υb)} it holds, for all x ∈Bk and all
y ∈Bk(x), that
M0,b(Υb) = Mx,b(Υb) = My,b(Υb) = M0,j(Υb) .
