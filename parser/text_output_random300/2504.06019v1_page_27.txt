region. The bsurf = 0.1 & RHsurf cases show a small region close to the surface where
the moisture flux towards the surface, which is caused by w′ < 0 in this region due to
the higher levels of CIN in these two cases. Note that the linear perturbation for the
nearly saturated RHsurf = 0.974 case shows a different behaviour to the other cases,
with the peaks in the moisture and buoyancy fluxes no longer occurring around the
LFC, but around the middle of the domain. Examining the Ryc panel of Figure 12, we
see that the critical Rainy number is almost independent of the surface temperature
and radiative cooling rate for the nearly saturated regimes, which is a result of low
levels of CIN and the LCL causing a different action of the linear perturbation.

Discussion
We have presented a detailed analysis of a simple framework for studying changes in
moist convection under climate change. The Rainy-Be´nard model is set up for climate
forcing simulations, by adding a constant radiative cooling term to the buoyancy
equation, and choosing appropriate boundary conditions: at the bottom boundary
we impose the relative humidity and surface temperature, and at the top boundary
we impose moist pseudoadiabatic boundary conditions which give the temperature,
buoyancy and humidity at the top boundary freedom to adjust. We also impose
idealised no-slip boundary conditions at both boundaries. Climate change can be
