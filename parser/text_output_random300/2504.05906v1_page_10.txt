The trends observed in these spectra are in close agreement with the energy eigenval-
ue distributions discussed earlier.  
In the absence of both e-e and e-ph interactions, the transmission probabilities for 
up-spin and down-spin electrons are found to be exactly identical across the entire 
energy range. As a result, the spin polarization coefficient remains zero throughout, 
indicating a complete lack of spin-dependent transport under these conditions. How-
ever, when e-e interaction is introduced (finite u), a distinct mismatch develops be-
tween the transmission profiles of up and down spin electrons. This mismatch leads to 
the emergence of a finite spin polarization at various energies. Notably, there are cer-
tain energy values where a remarkably high degree of spin polarization is achieved, 
highlighting the sensitivity of the systemâ€™s spin transport properties to electron-
electron interaction. The effect becomes even more pronounced upon the inclusion of 
e-ph coupling (finite g). To understand this behavior, it is important to consider the 
underlying mechanism: the mismatch between up and down spin channels is primarily 
governed by the asymmetry between the spin-resolved sub-Hamiltonians. This 
asymmetry is directly related to the ratio u/t. In the presence of e-ph coupling, both u 
and t experience a renormalization and generally decrease. However, the hopping 
integral t diminishes at a faster rate compared to u. As a result, the effective u/t ratio 
becomes larger when e-ph interaction is considered than when it is absent. A higher 
u/t ratio enhances the asymmetry between the spin channels, which in turn increases 
the mismatch between the up and down spin transmission probabilities. Consequently, 
this leads to a higher degree of spin polarization when electron-phonon interactions 
are present.  
Thus, the combined influence of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions 
plays a crucial role in engineering spin-polarized transport in the AAH chain, provid-
ing a potential route for tuning spintronic functionalities in low-dimensional quantum 
systems.  
Closing Remarks 
In this work, we have explored and demonstrated a new approach to enhance spin 
polarization in a simple one-dimensional chain, considering the combined effects of 
electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions within a two-terminal setup. Our 
analysis reveals that for an intermediate range of the electron-phonon coupling 
strength, the degree of spin polarization can increase with the enhancement of g. This 
finding suggests a new pathway to achieve a higher degree of spin polarization in 
such nanojunctions, a phenomenon that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been 
reported before. 
However, it is important to note that this trend does not persist for all values of g. 
When g becomes sufficiently large, the spin polarization starts to decrease with fur-
ther increases in the coupling strength. This suppression can be attributed to the 
strong electron-phonon interaction effectively screening the Hubbard interaction, 
thereby diminishing the correlation effects that are crucial for maintaining spin polari-
zation. Our study thus highlights a delicate balance between electron-electron and
