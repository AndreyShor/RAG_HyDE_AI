interior within the medium, the excitation sources were placed outside the ROI at random 
locations near the boundaries. An excitation signal comprising five frequencies (i.e., 500 Hz, 
1000 Hz, 1500 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 2500 Hz) with randomly assigned amplitude and phase was 
applied to these point sources. The wave equations were solved using a time interval of 5 µs 
over 2667 time steps, allowing 13.3 ms for wave propagation to reach a steady state and the 
formation of a fully reverberant shear wave field. White Gaussian noise with a signal-to-noise 
ratio of 10 dB was added to the shear-wave field. Figure 1(b) illustrates the 3D particle velocity 
field of the multi-frequency reverberant shear wave within the two-sided medium, highlighting 
wavelength variations on each side. The simulation was designed to mimic real OCE 
experiments, with the velocity field analyzed only along the sensor axis (z-axis). To estimate 
the SWS at different frequencies, the velocity field for each frequency was extracted from the 
multi-frequency reverberant shear wave field using bandpass frequency filters with a range of 
10 Hz centered at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 2500 Hz.

4.1 Experimental setup 
Figure 2 illustrates the schematic of the MFR-OCE system, which integrates a custom-built, 
fiber-based, swept-source OCT system with a piezoelectric actuator-based excitation 
mechanism. The swept-laser source (HSL-2100-HW, Santec, Aichi, Japan) has a spectral 
tuning range of approximately 140 nm, centered at a wavelength of 1310 nm. The system 
includes a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) for spectral nonlinearity calibration, as 
described by Yao et al. [41,42]. The measured depth resolution in air is approximately 6 μm.   
The sample arm incorporates a custom pupil-relay precision scanning mechanism in the 
sample arm to achieve diffraction-limited performance, as detailed by Xu et al. [43]. A Thorlabs 
microscope objective (model LSM03, Newton, NJ, USA) with an effective focal length of 36 
mm and a maximum field of view of 18 × 18 mm2 is used for scanning. The system’s lateral 
resolution is measured to be approximately 20 μm.  
The system employs two balanced photodetectors (model 1817-FC, Newport, Irvine, 
California, USA) to capture the two primary signals: (1) the interference signal between the 
sample and reference arms and (2) the MZI calibration signal. These detectors feature a 
bandwidth ranging from DC to 80 MHz and are sensitive to wavelengths between 900 nm and 
1700 nm. To maximize fringe contrast, two polarization controllers (Thorlabs FPC030) are 
used, i.e., one in the reference arm and one in the sample arm, for the OCT signal. Similarly, 
an additional polarization controller is used to maximize the fringe contrast of the MZI signal. 
The system sensitivity is measured to be approximately 110 dB. 
System operation is controlled using LabVIEW software (Version 14, National Instruments, 
Austin, TX, USA), which allows for adjustment of parameters such as the field of view, the 
number of lateral scanning points (B-mode scan), and the number of spectra to acquire at each
