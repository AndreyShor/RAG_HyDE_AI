A first guess would be to consider the ISO(1, 2) to be the appropriate gauge group. Note
though that the Chern-Simons functional is defined on simple Lie groups. Therefore, it is
not straightforward to develop a Chern-Simons gauge theory of ISO(1, 2). What is required
is to find an invariant quadratic form on the ISO(1, 2) Lie algebra. Indeed in 3-d for the
ISO(1, 2) group there exists the following invariant and non-degenerate form,
tr(JaPb) = δab ,
tr(PaPb) = 0 ,
tr(JaJb) = 0 ,
(5)
where Ja = 1
2ϵabcJbc are the three Lorentz generators and Pa are the three translations, which
together accommodate the six generators of the ISO(1, 2) group.
The above generators
satisfy the following commutation relations:
[Ja, Jb] = ϵabcJc ,
[Ja, Pb] = ϵabcP c ,
[Pa, Pb] = 0.
(6)
Then one can write down the gauge covariant derivative:
˜Dµ = ∂µ + [Aµ, ·] ,
(7)
where Aµ(x) is the gauge connection expanded on the generators of ISO(1, 2),
Aµ(x) = eµ
a(x)Pa + ωµ
a(x)Ja ,
(8)
i.e., a component gauge field has been assigned to each generator. The vielbein (dreibein)
field has been corresponded to the local translations and the spin connection to the Lorentz
transformations.
By construction ˜Dµ transforms covariantly providing the transformation rule of Aµ,
δAµ = −˜Dµϵ = −∂µ −[Aµ, ϵ] ,
(9)
where ϵ = ϵ(x) is the gauge transformation parameter, which, being an element of the
ISO(1, 2) algebra, can be expanded on its generators,
ϵ(x) = ξa(x)Pa + λa(x)Ja ,
(10)
with ξa(x) and λa(x) being infinitesimal parameters. Then from eqs (7), (9) and (10) and
using the algebra of generators (6) one finds the transformations of the fields e and ω,
δeµ
a = −∂µξa −ϵabceµbλc −ϵabcωµbξc ,
(11)
δωµ
a = −∂µλa −ϵabcωµbλc .
(12)
The next step in constructing of the action of the gauge theory of ISO(1, 2) is to determine
the tensors of the gauge fields using the commutator of the covariant derivative of the gauge
theory, ˜Dµ, i.e.
Rµν =
h
˜Dµ, ˜Dν
i
= ∂µAν −∂νAµ + [Aµ, Aν] ,
(13)
with Aµ the gauge connection (8). Taking into account that Rµν is valued in the algebra of
ISO(1, 2), we can also write its expansion on the generators of the algebra,
Rµν = Tµν
a(x)Pa + Rµν
a(x)Ja .
