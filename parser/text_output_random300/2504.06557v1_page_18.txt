Fig 4. Calculation results of mean clustering coefficient, graph density, graph 
reciprocity, and graph assortativity. (A1) market, (B1) power, (C1) gift, and (D1) 
concession economies for mean clustering coefficient 𝐶 (blue lines) and graph 
density 𝐷 (green lines). (A2) market, (B2) power, (C2) gift, and (D2) concession 
economies for graph reciprocity 𝑅 (blue lines) and graph assortativity 𝑆 (green
