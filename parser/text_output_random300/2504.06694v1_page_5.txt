is closed in H0(PV(X)) and the trace map TrCY : PV(X) →C is still nontrivial on H0(PV(X)) as the
canonical map Hn,n(PV(X)) →H0(PV(X)) is injective. Hence we have a nontrivial Frobenius algebra
(H0(PV(X)), ∧, ⟨−, −⟩CY).
Deﬁnition 2.1. We call the triple (H0(PV(X)), ∧, ⟨−, −⟩CY) the CY Frobenius algebra of a compact
Calabi–Yau manifold X of dimension n. By transport of structure via cΩX, it deﬁnes the CY Frobenius
algebra (Hn(X), •CY, ⟨−, −⟩CY).
We make the following observation.
Proposition 2.2. The trace map TrCY in (2.1) makes the following diagram
H0(PV(X)) × H0(PV(X))

2.2. LG Frobenius algebra. In this subsection, we discuss a Frobenius algebra structure on the middle-
dimensional primitive cohomology of a class of Calabi–Yau manifolds. This structure is induced from a
subalgebra of the Jacobian algebra and is therefore referred to as the LG Frobenius algebra structure.
Much of the content here reorganizes materials from [3], which should be consulted for additional details
and broader context.
Let P be an m-dimensional simplicial Gorenstein toric Fano variety, which by deﬁnition is a projective
orbifold. More concretely, there exists a simplicial fan Σ so that P = PΣ is the associated toric variety.
Moreover, we have the followings:
• There exists a homogeneous coordinate ring S = S(Σ) = C[z1, · · · , zr] of PΣ graded by the class
group Cl(PΣ) whose rank is r −m. Here r := #Σ(1) is the number of one-dimensional rays of
Σ. Each variable zi corresponds to the torus-invariant divisor Di, which is associated to a ray
in Σ(1) generated by a primitive element ρi.
• The anti-canonical divisor β = −KPΣ = P
ρ∈Σ(1) Dρ ∈Cl(PΣ) is Cartier and ample.
Let Xf ⊂P be a quasi-smooth Calabi–Yau hypersurface (of dimension m −1) deﬁned by f ∈S
of degree deg f = β = P
ρ∈Σ(1) Dρ so that Xf is ample. Recall that J(f) is the Jacobian ideal of S
generated by f1, · · · , fr, where fi = ∂f
∂zi , and we set
R(f) := S/J(f)
and
A(f) :=
∞
M
a=0
R(f)aβ.
Then A(f) is a subalgebra of R(f). This gives an algebra structure on A(f) that we denote by •LG. On
the other hand, there is no canonical trace map on A(f) because there is none on the Jacobian algebra
R(f) in this generality. In order to ﬁnd TrLG : A(f) →C in an analogous way to Proposition 2.2, we
ﬁrst turn to ﬁnding a graded vector space that is isomorphic to A(f).
5Note that the bilinear map ∧∗is symmetric (respectively, skew-symmetric) if n is even (respectively, n is odd).
