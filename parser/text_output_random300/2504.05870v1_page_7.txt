There remains gauge freedom to choose continuous θt and θb such that ∆θ ∼= θt −θb ± qπ (mod π),
e.g. θt = ∆θ
2 and θb = qπ −∆θ
2 ; or, θt = qπ + ∆θ and θb = 0; or, θb contains all surface defects and
is otherwise harmonic and θt = ∆θ + θb; etc.
Stability.
From f = λκ + f
∆θ we get ∂f
∂λ = κ, which turns eq. (12) into
κ · ∇B = κˆT ⊥· ∇B > 0.
(14)
Thus, stability requires that an increase in λ must induce positive curvature flow, namely locally
shorten the curve at every point. We can rewrite this condition only using B:
B2
yBxx −2BxByBxy + B2
xByy < 0.
(15)
Given a set of input curves B, eq. (15) is a quick sorting criterion to determine whether B is
realizable via temperature change, and if so in which direction.
II. Plate rotation
We consider a simple setup, similar to [24], where the top plate is at constant angle and is being
rotated with respect to the bottom plate. The control parameter β = ϕ in this case is the top plate
rotation angle, thus f
∆θ = 2πq(ϕ −θb). Then, from eq. (8):
θb = B + λκ(x, y)
2πq
= B + σλ

Stability.
From f = λκ + f
∆θ we get ∂f
∂ϕ = 2πq, which turns eq. (12) into
2πq ˆT ⊥· ∇B > 0.
(17)
Stability implies that a curve can deform only towards one of its sides as the top plate is rotated.
This direction is q ˆT ⊥for CCW rotation and −q ˆT ⊥for CW rotation. Equivalently, at its ends the
curve must co-rotate with the top plate around a positively charged surface defect on the bottom
plate, and counter-rotate with the top plate around a negatively charged defect.
III. Plate translation
We consider a translation of the top plate in some direction, say ˆx, by distance β = X. We then
get f
∆θ = 2πq(θt(x−X, y)−θb(x, y)±qπ). Like in the previous two examples, eq. (8) leaves us with
gauge freedom to split the pattern between the top and bottom plates. Unlike the previous two
