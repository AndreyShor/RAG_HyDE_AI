A comparison of the calculated modes and recorded IR spectra (see Fig. S12, Supplementary 
material) shows somewhat lower agreement than in the case of Raman spectra (see Fig. S11, 
Supplementary material). In general, an underestimation of the intensity of the P-H stretching 
modes (2400 cm-1) and low-frequency modes can be observed for all computational methods. 
Some problems with the position of the calculated modes are also evident for the most intense 
bands in the recorded IR spectrum in the 1100-900 cm-1 region (mainly concerning vibrational 
manifestations of the anion). It is again evident that the best agreement for the calculated 
stretching vibrations positions of the C-H, N-H, O-H and P-H groups was obtained with the 
“PBESOL0” method. Within the trio of computational methods compared, this method also 
provides the best match for the IR spectrum in the fingerprint region (see Fig. S12, 
Supplementary material). 
The solid-state DFT computational studies based on crystal structure determination 
concluded that the 2-AmpH2PO3 crystal is optically anisotropic biaxial negative material. The 
values of the calculated refractive indices and static (=) nonlinear susceptibility tensor χ(2) 
components are presented in Table S17, Supplementary material. The results indicate a general 
underestimation of the refractive indices values compared to the experimental data (roughly 
extrapolated for =) - see Chapter 3.6. The resulting set of refractive indices obtained by the 
“B3LYP” and “PBESOL0” methods seems to be closest to the expected values derived from 
experimental measurements. When comparing the results of the χ(2) components calculations, 
the largest differences are seen for 𝜒xxy
(2)  and 𝜒xyz
(2) components obtained by the “B3LYP” and 
“PBESOL0” methods.  
 
3.6. Linear optical properties of 2-AmpH2PO3 
From the determination of the refractive indices and their wavelength dependence of crystals 
of 2-AmpH2PO3, anomalous dispersion of the refractive indices becomes evident. Sellmeier 
coefficients of the three principal refractive indices are given in Table 7, and the measured (and 
corrected) refractive indices, together with the fitted Sellmeier functions, are plotted in Fig. 13.
