the mean values of the recovered rCBFi at each test phase. The mean value from the first test phase (30 minutes 
before lunch) was used as the global baseline for rCBFi calculation.

Discussion 
We successfully implemented a DL model trained on the two-layer DCS analytical model-
generated dataset with noise calculated from subject-specific baseline measurements. Our model 
demonstrated improved CBFi sensitivity ~87% vs 55%, rCBFi error ~5.8% vs 19% on simulated 
dataset, and 750× faster than fitting method during a brain activity test. 
Although our model showed excellent performance, it is worth noting that single-exponential 
fitting also performed well in our study, significantly enhancing CBF sensitivity and effectively 
minimizing the influence of the scalp layer relative to older conventional DCS setups (Fig. 9). This 
improvement can be attributed to advances in SPAD sensor technology, which enables early lag 
time detection while substantially improving the measurement SNR18–20,55. Single-exponential 
fitting, a simplified implementation of the semi-infinite analytical solution, is commonly used to 
characterize relative CBF changes13. Since the early part of the 𝑔𝑔2 curve is primarily influenced 
by brain blood flow, while the later part is dominated by scalp blood flow, fitting only the early 
portion of the 𝑔𝑔2  curve can enhance brain blood flow sensitivity while reducing scalp 
interference6,56. 
Indeed, a primary limitation of this work is also the restricted lag time range. The two-layer 
analytical model has demonstrated its ability to separate CBF and extracerebral blood flow. 
However, during training dataset preparation, the lag time range was tailored to 1.28 µs – 39.68 
µs to match the SPAD settings, which resulted in the loss of some dynamic information from 
shallow layers. By training only on the early portion of the 𝑔𝑔2 curve, we provided the network 
with less information about the slow decays from shallow flow, making it harder for the model to 
learn to distinguish extracerebral contributions. This limitation also explains why the DL model 
accurately recovers CBFi at lower flow rates but underestimates CBFi (Fig. 6) and rCBFi (Fig. 7) 
at higher flow rates. As BFi increases, the 𝑔𝑔2 curve shifts leftward and decays faster within the 
limited lag window, the restricted lag time range may not capture sufficient deep tissue
