Table I. Maximal values θk of ∥Ah∥2 such that the condition Eq. (37) is satisfied with δ = 10−8.
where the series converges absolutely for |x| < min{|t| : Dkk(t) = 0} =: νk, which is the smallest absolute
value among the zero points of Dkk(·). Therefore, let
G := e−AhRkk(Ah) −I,
and we obtain the following bound

where θ := ∥Ah∥2 < νk. It is clear that if A is a general matrix and only ∥A∥is known, then Eq. (36) provides
the tightest bound for ∥G∥2. We state the following lemma, whose proof is provided in Appendix C 1.

where θ := ∥Ah∥2 and fk(·) is defined in Eq. (36). Then, we have
∥bx(ih) −x(ih)∥2 ≤δT · (∥A∥2∥x(ih)∥2 + ∥b∥2) ,
∀i = 1, . . . , m.
(38)
In practice, we can evaluate fk(θ) to high precision using symbolic computation, as demonstrated in [16].
Let δ = 10−8.
We apply the bisection method to find the largest θ that satisfies Eq. (37), denoted by
θk. The results, shown in Table I, indicate that ∥Ah∥2 can be significantly larger than 1. Therefore, if the
approximation order k is predetermined, Lemma IV.2 allows us to choose h without the restriction ∥Ah∥2 ≤1.
This is especially advantageous when A is Hermitian and negative semi-definite, as the condition number of
Lm,k,p(Ah) can be bounded without the ∥Ah∥2 ≤1 condition.

Success probability
In quantum computation, we are concerned with the success probability of the algorithm. In the case
of solving Eq. (22), the resulting vector is stored in a quantum superposition state. After measuring this
superposition, we obtain the desired quantum state with a certain probability. The equation below illustrates
how the resulting vector is stored in a quantum state,
