Figure 4.  Thickness-dependent tuning of SPhPs in suspended SrTiO3 membranes. (a,b) SINS 
amplitude spectra were obtained through line scans on membranes with thicknesses of 50 nm (a) 
and 30 nm (b), respectively. The line scans are performed perpendicular to the edge of the 
membranes (at x=0). c) SINS amplitude line profiles (symbol) at  =325 cm-1 in RB2 for 
membranes with different thickness.  The green and red curves are the fit of the experimental data 
with the equation for the extraction of the figure of merit Q. d) Experimentally extracted (symbols) 
and theoretically calculated (solid curves) Q factors of the SPhPs in membranes with different 
thickness. The error bars represent the 95% confidence interval. e) lifetime Q  of SPhPs in 
suspended SrTiO3 with varying thicknesses. Solid curves represent calculations, while symbols 
indicate experimentally extracted values.
