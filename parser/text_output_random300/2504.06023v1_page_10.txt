Here, erfc(x) in Eq. (59) is the complementary error function.
By appropriately choosing the parameter α > 0, the compu-
tation of νe3dtf(r, L) via Eqs. (58) to (60) becomes efficient
for any r. Clearly, as α increases, the far-field contribution
becomes more significant, while as α decreases, the near-field
contribution dominates.
However, for convenience in deriving exact results, it is ad-
vantageous to express νe3dtf entirely as a Fourier-space series.
To achieve this, the real-space series in νR(r) is transformed
into an equivalent Fourier-space representation,

3. In deriving Eq. (62),
no specific value is assumed for α. However, since the ex-
pression is now entirely written as a Fourier-space series, one
may regard Eq. (62) as being fully determined by the far-field
contribution, corresponding to the limit α →∞.
The truncation schemes commonly employed in the
literature[38–40] correspond to the following explicit expres-
sions for wcd(r),

where σ is the screening length and rc is the cutoff distance.
Both σ and rc play the role of the length scales for wj(r). For
a fixed dimensionless parameter s, it is evident that w1(sσ),
w2(src), and w3(src) all scale inversely with their length
scales.
The three-dimensional Fourier transforms of these
functions are related to the Fourier transform of the Coulomb
interaction via

Here, kc = krc in Eqs. (69) and (70). These Fourier trans-
forms have been derived previously [51]. Under PBC, the ef-
fective pairwise interactions follow Eq. (21),
νj(r, L) = τj + 1

These constant terms play a crucial role in ensuring that the ef-
fective pairwise interactions dominate over the bare Coulomb
interaction. The behaviors of νj(r, L) are qualitatively sim-
ilar to those shown in Fig. 2. Notably, none of the effective
interactions—ν1(r, L), ν2(r, L), and ν3(r, L)—exhibit scal-
ing behavior [Eq. (32)] under the condition that the param-
eters σ and rc are fixed and independent of L. However, if
these length scales were assumed to be linearly proportional
to L, the scaling property of Eq. (32) would be restored.
