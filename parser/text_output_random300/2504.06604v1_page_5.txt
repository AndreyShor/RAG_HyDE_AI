First, a linear transformation is applied to the binarized 3D CT volume. This transformation involves rotating around
the principal axes of the 3D image. The rotation angles α, β, and γ are applied sequentially around the x-, y-, and
z-axes using the following rotation matrices:
Rx(α) =

The composite rotation matrix is:
R = Rz(γ) Ry(β) Rx(α).
(2)
We obtain the rotated CT volume by:
CT ′ = CT · R,
(3)
where CT is the binarized 3D volume image, and CT ′ is the rotated image. After rotation, a 2D slice is extracted from
the rotated image at slice index s along the original x-axis:
Is = CT ′(α, β, γ)

x=s.
(4)
We then employ a template-matching algorithm to quantify the similarity between the extracted CT section Is and the
thin section image T. Specifically, we compute the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) over every possible location of
T within Is. To ensure zero-mean data, we first subtract the mean intensity from both images:
T ′ = T −¯T,
I′
s = Is −¯Is.
(5)
The normalized cross-correlation (NCC) map is defined as:
NCC(u, v) =
P
p,q

I′
s(p + u, q + v) T ′(p, q)

rhP
p,q(I′s(p + u, q + v))2
i hP
p,q(T ′(p, q))2
i,
(6)
where (u, v) denote the offsets applied to the reference image Is, and (p, q) range over the valid region of the template
T, satisfying 0 ≤p < w and 0 ≤q < h, where w and h denote the width and height of T, respectively.
The peak value of the NCC map indicates the highest similarity between Is and T, corresponding to the optimal
alignment. Thus, for a given rotation and slice index, we can determine the best placement of the thin section T within
the trial section Is. We formulate the objective function for optimization as follows:
f(α, β, γ, s) = −max
u,v NCC(u, v | Is, T),
(7)
(α∗, β∗, γ∗, s∗) = arg min
α,β,γ,s f(α, β, γ, s).
(8)
Differential evolution (DE) is an evolutionary algorithm to minimize this objective function [Storn and Price, 1997].
DE initializes a population of parameter vectors given the bounds of each of the four parameters. The initial population
at generation 0 is
