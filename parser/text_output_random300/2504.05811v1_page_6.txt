In addition, we attach a phase factor Exp[iϕR] in front of the tree-level amplitude, to partially mimic
the loop contributions as illustrated in Fig. 2. Similarly, all the other hidden-strange molecules are
treated in the same manner, and the Lagrangians introduced for them are referred to Ref. [40], cor-
responding via the spin-parity. The masses of N(1535)1/2−, N(1875)3/2−, N(2080)1/2−& 3/2−,
N(2270)1/2−, 3/2−& 5/2−are taken as 1535, 1875, 2080 and 2270 MeV, respectively. Furthermore,

FITTING SETTINGS
The fit parameters of this theoretical model are adjusted to match the experimental data in a χ2
minimization using MINUIT [58, 59]. Below, we present our selected settings for the experimental
data and fit parameters.
A.
Data base
The experimental data used in our fit are listed in Table I. We have compiled nearly all available
experimental data for the γp →K+Σ0 and γp →K0Σ+ reactions. However, we exclude certain
datasets, including the differential cross-section data for γp →K0Σ+ from the A2 2019 [60], the
photon beam asymmetry data for γp →K0Σ+ from the CBELSA 2014 [28], and some older data,
due to issues such as inconsistencies with others, sparsity or larger errors. To concentrate on the
regions with potential contributions from exchanges of the molecules, we select the experimental
data within the center-of-mass energy range from the KΣ threshold up to 2400 MeV. The new
polarization observables for γp →K0Σ+ from CLAS 2024 [39] have also been included, and the
definitions of the polarization observables are detailed in Refs. [61, 62].
From Table I, we can observe significant variations in the number of available data points across
different reaction channels and observables, which may result in the fit ignoring some observable
data due to their limited quantity. To address this issue, there is a standard weighting procedure
