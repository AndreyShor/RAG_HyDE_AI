on one-loop renormalizability is lost.
Later, in 1985 Marc Goroff and Augusto Sagnotti [29]
calculated the non-renormalizable two-loop divergence in pure gravity. At this point, knowing
that the SM Lagrangian is strictly renormalizable, one should still ask whether something similar
can be obtained for gravity, analogously to what happened with the transition from Fermi’s
theory to electroweak completion. Around 1974, Stanley Deser [230] and Steven Weinberg [231]
were the first to propose quadratic gravity as a strictly renormalizable QFT of gravity. They
used only power counting arguments, but the complete proof of renormalizability was performed
by Kellog Stelle in 1976 [39]. Quadratic gravity was further studied in the following years [40–
46, 232–238], but it was soon abandoned because most physicists of that time were afraid of
ghosts and, moreover, the potential phenomenological implications of the theory had not yet
been appreciated. In fact, quadratic gravity slowly started to be forgotten, while in those years
alternative approaches, paradigms and frameworks for quantum gravity were proposed.
Alternative approaches. From 1974 and especially in the 1980s (super)string theory had a
revival and with it the S-matrix bootstrap again [239–244]. The idea of supergravity started
to become popular in 1976 [245].
In the same years Steven Weinberg also tried to depart
from the standard framework of perturbative QFT and proposed what is known as asymptoti-
cally safe quantum gravity [246, 247]. According to this approach, the EFT Lagrangian of GR,
containing infinitely many (perturbatively) non-renormalizable operators, could eventually be
non-perturbatively renormalizable, if there existed an interacting UV fixed point with a finite-
dimensional critical surface [248,36]. It was during this period that the Wilsonian view of renor-
malizability began to spread in the high-energy physics community, and with it the idea that all
QFTs, including the strictly renormalizable ones, could simply be EFTs [73–75,34]. In the second
half of the 1980s, approaches aiming at a fully non-perturbative (discrete) quantization of space-
time were proposed, such as loop quantum gravity [249–251] and causal set theory [252]. In 1987
the idea of non-local field theories was again considered, this time applied to gravity [253, 254].
Nowadays all these approaches, in addition to new ones, are still actively studied [88].
QFT and strict renormalizability again. The community of QFT in curved spacetime
knew already in the early 1980s that quadratic terms in the curvature could have interesting phe-
nomenological implications for the early universe cosmology, especially thanks to Alexei Starobin-
sky’s inflationary model [116–121]. However, the history of those years evolved in such a way that
the quantum gravity community did not try to take advantage of it, probably because concrete ob-
servational data were still lacking. In fact, it was only after the 2012 WMAP data [255] and espe-
cially after the 2013 Planck data [256] that Starobinsky inflation began to be taken very seriously.
Shortly thereafter, quadratic gravity – namely the old lore of quantizing gravity in the framework
of perturbative QFT consistently with the strict renormalizability criterion – began to experience
a renaissance. This started with the works of Alberto Salvio [76, 47–51], Bob Holdom [53–55],
Damiano Anselmi and Marco Piva [58–61], John Donoghue and Gabriel Menezes [63–67]. As
