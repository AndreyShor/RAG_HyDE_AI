to extract the secret key.
An important condition must be satisfied for the security of rDI-QKD. This condition is captured in the
following theorem [251].
Theorem 7. Long-range quantum correlation as defined in 15 is necessary for the security of rDI-QKD.
Proof. The proof can be done by contradiction. Let us consider that Alice and Bob only generate the
SRQ correlation of the form (78), then Eve can perform the parent POVM N = {Nλ} on the public
channel between R and B. Since Eve can keep a copy of the classical outcome λ, the correlation between
A and B was factorized when conditioned on Eve’s information, i.e. p(a, b|x, y, λ) = p(a|x, λ)p(b|y, λ),
implying that no secure key can be extracted between A and B when only an SRQ correlation exists in
the protocol.
General behavior of Eavesdropper in rDI-QKD. Based on the location of the relay R, the device T, and
the source, two situations can be considered: first, consider them as being outside Alice’s and Bob’s labs
and in full control of the eavesdropper, and the second option is to assume that the relay R and the device
T are all situated in Alice’s lab by imposing the condition that they cannot arbitrarily communicate their
private input to Alice’s device. Clearly, security in the first case also implies security in the second case
since in the first case, the eavesdropper has more power. The protocol in [251] considered the first case in
which Eve has the measurement device T that performs a measurement Tz = {Tc|z} that acts jointly on
the subsystems B and E when s = 0, as this is the most general thing she can do to simulate the honest
correlation between A and T. Considering this behavior for Eve, the secret key rate can be calculated
using the method explained in section 4.2.1.
3.8.3. Mermin-Peres Magic Square Game-based DI-QKD
In 2023, Zhen et al. [71] proposed a DI-QKD protocol based on the Mermin-Peres Magic Square
Game (MPG) [196, 195]. The Mermin-Peres Magic Square Game is as follows [196, 195]: There are two
players, Alice and Bob, who are forbidden to communicate with each other. In each round of the game, a
referee generates two random “trits” x, y ∈{0, 1, 2} and sends index x to Alice and index y to Bob. Alice
and Bob then reply to the referee with [ax
0, ax
1, ax
2] and [by
0, by
1, by
2] under the conditions that ax
2 = ax
0 + ax
1
and by
2 = by
0 + by
1 ⊕1. The winning condition is when ax
i=y = by
j=x. After the game, the referee decides
whether Alice and Bob win or not according to the average winning probability
ω = 1
9
X
x,y
p(ax
y = by
x|x, y)
(105)
where p(ax
y = by
x|x, y) is the winning probability of Alice and Bob with respect to (x, y). The MPG
DI-QKD in [71] is based on the fact that for all classical strategies ω ≤8
9 and since all classical strategies
are equal to local hidden variables, then ω ≤8
9 is actually a Bell inequality that some quantum strategies
can violate [252, 253].
In the protocol, Alice and Bob initially generate data by playing the MPG. They announce their inputs
and record the overlapped bits. To estimate parameters, Alice communicates to Bob which part of the
bits serves as raw keys, with the remaining part of the bits announced to play the MPG. If the average
winning probability estimated from the announced data is less than an expected value, they abort the
protocol; otherwise, they perform data reconciliation on raw keys to obtain the final keys. They provided
the security analysis of the protocol against collective attacks in the asymptotic scenario and showed
that if ω > 0.9575, it generates higher secret keys than the CHSH-based protocol for ρp of Fig. 2b with
p > 0.978 (η = 1) or η ≥0.982 (p = 1). Later in [254], this protocol is generalized to the finite-round
regime under general attacks.
Parallel DI-QKD. The protocols discussed so far generate p = {p(ab|xy)}abxy sequentially where each
run a bipartite state ρ is shared. Theoretically, a parallel execution is equivalent if the devices receive
all inputs x, y simultaneously, and return the outputs a, b at once. The security proof is still possible
[255], but higher-dimensional entanglement is required. This is technologically more challenging than
sequential methods. The key finding shows that assuming perfect private randomness and trusted classical
computation, Bell nonlocality alone can ensure the generation of shared keys of any length.
