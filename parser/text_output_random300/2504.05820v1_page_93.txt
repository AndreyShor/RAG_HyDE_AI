Figure 3.9: Same as Fig. 3.8 for different values of the charm mass. Note that the 3FNS momentum
fraction for perturbative charm vanishes identically by assumption.
It is interesting to understand in detail the impact of the MHOU on the momentum fraction
carried by intrinsic charm. To this purpose, we have computed the truncated momentum
integral, i.e. Eq. (3.3) but only integrated down to some lower integration limit xmin:
[c]tr (xmin) =
Z 1
xmin
dx xc+(x, Q2) .
(3.4)
Note than in the 3FNS xc+(x) does not depend on scale, so this becomes a scale-independent
quantity. The result for our default intrinsic charm determination is displayed in Fig. 3.10,
as a function of the lower integration limit xmin. It is clear that for xmin ≳0.2 the truncated
momentum fraction differs significantly from zero, thereby providing evidence for intrinsic
charm with similar statistical significance as the local pull shown in Fig. 3.13. For x <∼0.2 this
significance is then washed out by the large MHOUs.
Hence, while the total momentum fraction has been traditionally adopted as a measure of
intrinsic charm, our analysis shows that, once MHOUs are accounted for, the information
provided by the total momentum fraction is limited, at least with current data and theory.
3.2.4. Z+charm production in the forward region
The production of Z bosons in association with charm-tagged jets (or alternatively, with
identified D mesons) at the LHC is directly sensitive to the charm content of the proton via the
dominant gc →Zc partonic scattering process. Measurements of this process at the forward
rapidities covered by the LHCb acceptance [248] provide access to the large-x region where
the intrinsic contribution is expected to dominate. This is in contrast with the corresponding
measurements from ATLAS and CMS, which only become sensitive to intrinsic charm at rather
larger values of pZ
T than those currently accessible experimentally.
Following [254, 248], we have obtained theoretical predictions for Z+charm production at
LHCb with NNPDF4.0, based on NLO QCD calculations using POWHEG-BOX [255] interfaced to
