Figure 1. The figure presents the γ-ray and optical emissions observed between MJD 55900 and 60150. The top panel displays
the weekly binned γ-ray flux (blue points) along with its Bayesian block (BB) representation (black curve). The bottom panel
shows the ASAS-SN optical light curve (green) with the corresponding BB representation (black curve). The grey horizontal
lines in both panels indicate the mean γ-ray flux and optical magnitude, respectively.
In this study, we used publicly available python code4
(M. E. Aydin 2017) to generate the WWZ map. The
observed power concentration is located around 0.00132
day−1 (757 ± 80 days) in the WWZ map utilizing γ-ray
emissions (see Figure 2) and at ∼0.00131 day−1 (763 ±
102 days) in optical WWZ map (see Figure 3). In both
cases, the observed local significance surpasses 99.73%.
The uncertainty on the period was estimated using the
method as described in section 3.1.
3.3. REDFIT
The light curves of AGNs are typically unevenly sam-
pled, of finite duration, and predominantly influenced by
red noise, which arises from stochastic processes occur-
ring in the accretion disk or jet. Red noise spectra are
characteristic of autoregressive processes, where current
activity is related to past behavior. The emissions from
AGNs are effectively modeled using a first-order autore-
gressive (AR1) process.
To model such behavior, the
software programme REDFIT, developed by M. Schulz
& M. Mudelsee (2002), is specifically designed to ana-
lyze the stochastic nature of AGNs dominated by red
noise. This software fits the light curve AR(1) process,

where the current emission (rt) depends linearly on the
previous emission (rt−1) and a random error term (ϵt).
The AR(1) process is defined as:
r(ti) = Air(ti−1) + ϵ(ti)

where r(ti) is the flux value at time ti and Ai =

∈[0, 1], A is the average autocorrela-

In our study, we used the publicly available RED-
FIT5 code to analysis the light curve. In this method,
the Nyquist frequency is defined as fNyq = Hfac/(2∆t),
where the factor Hfac is introduced to prevent the noisy
