and the Public Goods Game [13].
The Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (PDG) and the Snowdrift Game (SDG) are two funda-
mental two-player, two-strategy game models, each representing a distinct social dilemma.
In both games, two players simultaneously choose between two strategies: cooperation (C)
or defection (D). If both players cooperate, they each receive a reward payoff R; if both
defect, they receive a punishment payoff P. When one player cooperates while the other
defects, the cooperator incurs the sucker’s payoff S, whereas the defector obtains the temp-
tation payoff T. In the PDG, the parameters satisfy T > R > P > S along with 2R > T +S,
meaning that defection is always the dominant strategy, leading to mutual defection as the
equilibrium outcome. In contrast, in the SDG, the parameters satisfy T > R > S > P,
implying that a player benefits most by choosing the strategy opposite to their opponent’s
choice. In recent years, research has increasingly focused on multi-game models that in-
tegrate both PDG and SDG, yielding important insights. For instance, Huang et al. [14]
introduced desire-driven update rules in multi-game settings and analyzed their impact on
the evolution of cooperation. Roy et al. [15] proposed a multi-game theoretical model that
elucidates mechanisms for maintaining biodiversity. Furthermore, Liu et al. [16] investigated
how perceived competition and learning costs influence cooperation in multi-game systems,
demonstrating that these factors can significantly enhance the prevalence of cooperative
behavior.
In the past few decades, numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the
emergence and persistence of cooperative behavior. Notably, Nowak summarized five key
rules [17]: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, group selection, and network
reciprocity. Among these, network reciprocity has been shown to significantly promote co-
operation within a system, attracting substantial research interest [18–20]. In structured
populations, individuals interact only with their immediate neighbors, and cooperators can
resist the invasion of defectors by forming cooperative clusters [21]. The evolution of cooper-
ation has been extensively studied across various network structures, including small-world
networks [22, 23], scale-free networks [24, 25], interdependent networks [26, 27], signed net-
works [28], and higher-order networks [29–31]. Additionally, various mechanisms such as
aspiration [32], memory [33], reputation [34], punishment [35], and migration [36] have been
explored to better understand the emergence and stability of cooperation. Furthermore, the
