Figure 1. Optimization scheme for a two-qubit model with experimental limitation of allowed
interaction strengths g ∈[−2, 2]. (a) The final fidelity F as a function of the protocol period
T obtained for different numbers M of optimization instants. Along with increasing M, the
final fidelity saturates at maximally allowed value. Points X and Y mark protocol time T for
which the final fidelity approaches 99% for M = 3 and M = 9 respectively. (b) The minimal
duration T needed to reach the final fidelity F = 0.99 for a given number of points M. (c)
Two examples of an optimized time sequence of interactions g(t) leading at finite time T to
the target state |tar⟩with fidelity F = 99%. These examples correspond to points X and Y
marked in plot (a). In plots (a) and (b) time is expressed in natural units ¯h/∆.
is a direct manifestation of the well-known fundamental limit of non-adiabatic protocols –
the quantum speed limit [28]. For completeness of the discussion, in Fig. 1c we present two
exemplary solutions of the optimization procedure performed for two different situations
(defined by the number of points M and the protocol period T). In the top row, we present
the time dependence of the control field g(t) leading to the final fidelity on the level of 99%.
The bottom row presents corresponding temporal fidelity with the target state F(t). These
two examples correspond to two points marked in Fig. 1a.
Similar analysis can be performed for two other experimental limitations, i.e., when
we have access only to positive or negative values of the control parameter, g(t) ∈[0, 2] or
g(t) ∈[−2, 0], respectively. In Fig. 2 we compare the results for all three scenarios with the
same initial and target states. Plots show the maximal possible fidelity Fmax as a function
of total duration T obtained by optimization over the number of points M. The vertical
red dashed line indicates the estimated quantum speed limit time TQSL, i.e., the minimal
period T for which the optimized fidelity Fmax can be saturated close to 1 (in the case
studied, the fidelity can be saturated at F = 1 −δ, with δ < 10−10). It can be viewed as
