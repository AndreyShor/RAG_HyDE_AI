where z(u) is the minimal surface embedding with z(u = R) = 0.
By the RT formula, this
corresponds to the entanglement entropy of a disk of radius R in the boundary CFT at finite
temperature T = 3/(4πzH). Linearizing the entanglement entropy around T = 0 then corresponds
to linearizing the minimal surface embedding z(u) and then the area function around zH = ∞, i.e.,
around pure AdS:

1 −x2 is the minimal surface embedding Σ in pure AdS – just the usual hemisphere embedding
anchored on the boundary entangling surface ∂Σ, a disk with radius R. The first term corresponds
to the standard UV-divergent entanglement entropy of a disk of radius R at T = 0, which plays no
role in our analysis. The rest of the terms are dual to the entanglement entropy density, which are
obtained upon a finite deformation by temperature [54],
σ = SEE −SEE|T =0
Vol(∂Σ)
.
(A.5)
Here σ is a UV-finite quantity by construction and hence will be a good candidate for the data too.
In what follows, we focus on only the second term, giving rise to the entanglement entropy
deformation strictly at T = 0. By making contact with the notation in the main text,
A(R) = A(R)|s=0 + s d
dsAs|s=0 + . . .

where we identified s ∝(RT)3. It is useful to view the perturbation as obtained by keeping the
radius of the disk R fixed and varying the temperature, but since this is a perturbation in the
underlying CFT, it is equivalent to keep T = 0 and vary the radius instead. In other words, the
entangling surface A is kept intact, in this case the disk of area πR2, but the area of the dual hanging
surface changes upon deformation by the temperature. We further note that the perturbation arises
at the third order power in T as we are not deforming the Hamiltonian of the theory but the state.
An explicit calculation of the integral in the second term in (A.4) gives
δA(R) = 4GNδSEE(R) = 16π4l2R3

This is our ‘synthetic’ boundary data: it was obtained from a bulk computation but now we pretend
that it actually came from the boundary CFT, due to lack of existing results produced directly in
the field theory.

Linearizations of the minimal surface equation
As in [35], we want to linearize the minimal surface equation in pure AdS4 around the hemisphere
solution so we set f = 1 in (3.12). As it is easier to work in coordinates that are natural for this
problem, we transform the minimal surface equation (3.12) into spherical coordinates and obtain
