Extended Data Fig. 10 | Density of state calculations of 3.89° tMoTe2. a, Calculated 
electronic density of states (DOS) as a function of sublattice potential difference Δ (the energy 
difference induced by the displacement field D between layers) and νh. The van Hove 
singularity (VHS), located at νh ≈ 0.80 when Δ = 0, shifts toward higher values of νh as the Δ 
increases. b-c, DOS at Δ = 0 meV (b), 10 meV (c), and 20 meV (d). The VHS is highlighted 
by dashed lines. The conversion between Δ and D can be estimated by 𝐷𝐷/𝜀𝜀hBN =
Δ/ ൬
𝜀𝜀hBN
𝜀𝜀MoTe2 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒൰. Here t ≈ 0.7 nm is the interlayer separation between the MoTe2 monolayers. 
The out-of-plane dielectric constant of hBN and 2H-MoTe2 is about 𝜀𝜀hBN ≈3 and 𝜀𝜀MoTe2 ≈
9, respectively [76]. Based on the above estimations, Δ = 10 meV corresponds to D ≈ 130 
mV/nm.
