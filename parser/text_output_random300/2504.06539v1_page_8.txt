Backward scattering
The forward scattering vanishes for the 3-point interaction, so we only need to evaluate the second
term in Eq. (3.24). From Eq. (2.6), the interaction Hamiltonian is given by
HI = −a2
Mpl
Z
d3x hij∂iχ ∂jχ .
(3.25)
Using Eq. (2.8) and
χ(τ, x) =
Z
d3k
(2π)3 eik·xχk(τ) ,
(3.26)
we can rewrite the interaction Hamiltonian as
HI = a2
Mpl
Z d3k d3p1 d3p2
(2π)9
(2π)3δ(k + p1 + p2)
X

e(s)
ij (k)h(s)
k p1ip2jχp1χp2 .
(3.27)
Let us define the energy-momentum tensor projected onto the graviton polarization plane as
T (s)
k
≡−a2
Z d3l d3p
(2π)3 δ(k + l + p)e(s)
ij (k)lipjχlχp .
(3.28)
Then, the interaction Hamiltonian can be further simplified to
HI = −M −1

(3.29)
or more concisely,
HI = −M −1

Here, S encapsulates both the momentum and polarization indices and repeated S implies sum-
mation over polarization and integration over momentum. We will use the notations in Eqs. (3.29)
and (3.30) interchangeably in the following discussion.
For O = N S, LS, Eq. (3.24) expands as

The term B[O] is independent of the graviton quantum state, corresponding to the spontaneous
emission from the scalar field. This type of contribution is often considered in the graviton pro-
duction in thermal plasma [23] and induced gravitational waves from density fluctuations [6]. In
contrast, A[O] depends on the initial graviton state and thus represents stimulated emission. One
can show that A[O] dominates for infrared (IR) graviton modes. Therefore, we will neglect spon-
taneous emission in the subsequent analysis.
