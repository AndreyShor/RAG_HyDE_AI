Meticulous Estimator
The problems we just discussed also hints to a valid solution to get rid of the polynomial overhead in d.
By
converting the univariate mean value estimator in Algorithm 3 to a quantum circuit, one can obtain a unitary that
approximates eiN⟨⃗u,E[ ⃗X]⟩arbitrarily close with few assumptions.
By Remark III.12 and Theorem II.43, with O(n) access to the quantum experiment of some univariate random
variable X, for some random variable X, variance bound σ0 ⩾0, mean bound 0 ⩽ε0 ⩽1
3σ0, and 0 < δ < 1, we can
construct unitary U on H′
Ω⊗Houtput with:
U |0⟩|0⟩=
X
j∈Ω′
√qj |λj⟩|yj⟩
(137)
where Ω′ is some probability space corresponding measurements results during the execution of the algorithms, yj
corresponds to instances of a random variable y. Thus U “output” a mean value estimate in the sense of the following
lemma,
Lemma IV.6 (Quantizing the Constrained Classical Univariate Estimator, Algorithm 3). For y, Ω′ that we just
defined above, if the random variable X satisfy:
• Var X ⩽σ2
0.
• E [X] ⩽ε0 ⩽1
3σ0
The unitary we constructed satisfy
PΩ′

|y −E[X]| ⩽σ0

⩾1 −δ
(138)
where PΩ′ indicates that the probability is taken over Ω′.
Given some integer N, we can also generate a phase operator Q that converts output register’s value into a phase:
Q |z⟩= eiNz |z⟩.
(139)
From these unitaries we construct:
V = U † (I ⊗Q) U
(140)
The claim is that V approximates a phase oracle to produce eiNE[X], as found in the following theorem.
Theorem IV.7 (Approximating the Phase Unitary using Quantum Subroutine). Given some small constant ξ > 0,
N ∈N+, σ0 ⩾0. We feed to U with parameters (n, σ0, ε0, δ) replaced with
l
3Nσ0

, and we feed in N to
construction of Q.
Then, when the random variable X satisfy:
• Var X ⩽σ2
0.
• E [X] ⩽ε0 ⩽1
3σ0
We find:
V |0⟩|0⟩−eiNE[X] |0⟩|0⟩
 ⩽ξ
(141)
Proof. Consider only the action of (I ⊗Q)U, it produces a state:
|ψ⟩= (I ⊗Q)U |0⟩|0⟩=
X
j∈Ω′
√qjeiNyj |λj⟩|yj⟩
(142)
We want this state to be:
|φ⟩= (I ⊗Q)U |0⟩|0⟩=
X
j∈Ω′
√qjeiNE[X] |λj⟩|yj⟩
(143)
