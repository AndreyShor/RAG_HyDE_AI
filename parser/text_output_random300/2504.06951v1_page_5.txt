inverse of X.

• GLT 5. If {An}n ∼GLT κ and An = Xn + Yn, where
– every Xn is Hermitian,
– ||Xn||, ||Yn|| ≤C for some constant C independent of n,
– n−1∥Yn∥1 →0,
then {An}n ∼λ κ.
• GLT 6. If {An}n ∼GLT κ and each An is Hermitian, then {f(An)}n ∼GLT f(κ) for every continuous
function f : C →C.
Notice that a matrix-sequence {An}n as in Axiom GLT 5. is defined as quasi-Hermitian. The related
theory developed in [16, 7] represents a useful way for overcoming the strict requirements of the Hermitian
character of the matrices in the standard a.c.s. topology.
In the following sections, namely Section 3 and Section 4, we prove that two remarkable matrix-sequences
stemming from mean-field quantum spin systems are GLT matrix-sequences. In particular, a properly scaled
matrix-sequence associated with the Curie-Weiss model is a zero-distributed Hermitian (real symmetric)
matrix-sequence i.e. GLT matrix-sequence with 0 GLT symbol, while the one associated with the restricted
model is a GLT matrix-sequence with an interesting non-trivial GLT symbol. For the sake of notational
clarity, for the matrix-sequence in Section 3, the size is dN = 2N.

Curie-Weiss model
We consider the Hamiltonian for the quantum Curie-Weiss model for ferromagnetism, which takes the form
HCW
ΛN = −
Γ
2|ΛN|
X
x,y∈ΛN
σ3(x)σ3(y) −B
X
x∈ΛN
σ1(x),
(3.1)
where ΛN is an arbitrary finite subset of Zℓ, Γ > 0 scales the spin-spin coupling, and B is an external
magnetic field. This model describes a chain of N immobile spin-1/2 particles with ferromagnetic coupling
in a transverse magnetic field.
The Hamiltonian acts on the Hilbert space HΛN = ⊗x∈ΛN Hx, where
Hx = C2. The operator σi(x), . . . (i = 1, 2, 3) acts as the Pauli matrix σi on Hx and acts as the unit matrix
