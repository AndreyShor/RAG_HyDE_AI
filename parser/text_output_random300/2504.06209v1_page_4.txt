FIG. 3. Bayesian network for a percept-action loop. Shown
is a fragment for rounds t −1, t, and the beginning of round
t + 1.
This type of Bayesian network plays an important
role in the information-theoretic framework underlying our
results (see Supplemental Material E for details). Note that
to faithfully represent the dynamics of the agent and envi-
ronment, auxiliary nodes (gray and reduced in size) are in-
cluded. The colorized nodes illustrate the condition for an
agent to be maximally predictive in round t: the agent’s mem-
ory (blue) must store all information from past actions and
percepts S0:tA0:t+1 (red) that is relevant for predicting the
current percept St (green).
is because the agent’s memory, which can be seen as a
function of the past, A0:t+1S0:t, must serve as a sufficient
statistic for St for eq. (8) to vanish [29]. Computational
mechanics shows that there are channels that admit suf-
ficient statistics only with a countably infinite number of
states [30]. In this work, instead of allowing agents infi-
nite memory, we consider so-called unifilar environment
channels [25, 31], for which there always exist predictive
and a.m. predictive agents.
Definition 4. An environment model envM = (Φ, pZ0)
is said to be unifilar if
• pZ0 is a delta distribution and
• H(Zt+1|At, St, Zt) = 0 for all t ∈N0.
An environment channel env is said to be unifilar if there
exists a unifilar model for it.
Unifilar models have the useful property that the val-
ues of At, St, and Zt fully determine the value of Zt+1
for all rounds t, enabling an agent, given the initial value
of Z0, to perfectly track the hidden state of the environ-
ment. The following theorem is based on this insight:
Theorem 1. Let agt →
←env be any percept-action loop.
If the environment channel is unifilar, then there exists
an a.m. predictive agent model agtM for agt.
See Supplemental Material F for a proof. Before pre-
senting our results on work capacity, we first demonstrate
that Definition 3 for predictive agents recovers the defini-
tion previously used in the context of stationary processes
in the tape setting [17]. Note that a process X is sta-
tionary if pXn:m = pXn+t:m+t for all n, t ∈N0 and m > n.
The tape setting can be embedded within the percept-
action loop framework [32] by making the environment
channel effectively generate the tape pattern, i.e., it acts
as a finite-state source of percepts unaffected by actions:
νS|A(s|a) = νS|A(s|a′) for all a, a′ ∈AN0. Channels
with this property are also known as product channels
[33].
The following theorem reveals a remarkable property
of predictive agents in the stationary regime:
being
a.m. predictive of the next percept is equivalent to be-
ing predictive of all future percepts at all times.
Theorem 2. Let agtM →
←env be such that the joint pro-
cess MAS of actions, percepts, and agent memory is
stationary. Then, agtM is a.m. predictive, i.e.,
⟨I[A0:t+1S0:t; St|Mt]⟩t = 0
(11)
if and only if
I[A0:t+1S0:t; St:∞|Mt] = 0
∀t ∈N0.
(12)
If in addition
env is a product channel,
agtM is
a.m. predictive if and only if
I[S0:t; St:∞|Mt] = 0
∀t ∈N0.
(13)
See Supplemental Material F for a proof utilizing the
Markov conditions of the underlying Bayesian network
(see Figure 3). The second part of the theorem connects
our definition of a.m. predictive agents to the one by Boyd
et al. [17] who define predictive agents via eq. (13) and
another condition which is automatically fulfilled for the
type of channels considered in this work (see [34] for a
different notion of predictive agents) [35].

WORK CAPACITY OF CHANNELS
So far, we have treated agents and environments as
abstract information-processing systems.
However, as
Landauer famously quipped, information is physical [36]:
any implementation of an agent must ultimately rely
on physical memory and dynamics subject to thermo-
dynamic laws. To analyze the energetic limits of such
implementations, we adopt a framework from stochas-
tic thermodynamics that models the agent’s information
processing—described by its transition matrix Φagt—as
a physical process acting on memory [7, 8]. We briefly
outline its assumptions.
In this framework, memory is represented by a phys-
ical system coupled to a thermal reservoir at temper-
ature T.
The system possesses a few degrees of free-
dom, the information-bearing degrees of freedom, which
are assumed to be meta-stable, i.e., their equilibration
time τinfo is much larger than that of the system’s other
degrees of freedom, τothers.
Information processing on
the information-bearing degrees of freedom is carried out
through an isothermal protocol, i.e., a protocol executed
at constant temperature T, with a time scale such that
