Figure 26: Comparison of the predicted temporal evolution of streamwise velocity com-
ponents for (a) HOSVD (left column) and (b) SVD (right column) across different LSTM
architectures for the experimental wake flow. From top to bottom: LSTM 1 Dense, LSTM
2 dense, and LSTM Time-Distributed.
wise velocity component is not centered at zero. Notably, the results for the SVD-based
LSTM time-distributed architecture are relatively better, with a more pronounced peak
and reduced variability compared to the other SVD architectures. However, even in this
case, SVD falls short of the precision exhibited by HOSVD.
To further assess the robustness of HOSVD, noisy modes were introduced in the train-
ing set. Simulations were carried out using 20 modes and 50 modes. While the RRMSE
values for the streamwise velocity component follow similar trends as obtained with 5
modes, owing to its stronger flow features, the normal velocity component warrants closer
attention. This component comprises very low-velocity regions, and even a small amount
of noise will have a considerable impact. The RRMSE values reported in Table 16 demon-
strate that HOSVD exhibits superior performance over SVD, where the error is reduced
