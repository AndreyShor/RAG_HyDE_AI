FIG. 1. (a) Schematic of the experimental device. The device consists of a transmon qubit (Q) dispersively coupled to a high-quality factor
storage cavity (S) and a low-quality factor readout cavity (R). The transmon qubit serves as the reusable qubit, with real-time feedback enabling
reset after each iteration. The storage cavity functions as the mediating qubit, facilitating quantum entanglement due to its longer lifetime.
The readout cavity plays crucial roles in both measurement and error mitigation. (b) Circuit diagram of the VQE. We utilize one reusable
qubit and one mediating qubit to execute N layers of a parameterized circuit. The circuit is specifically tailored for our experimental setup,
serving as the variational ansatz and efficiently representing an N + 1-qubit quantum state as an MPS with small bond dimensions. Since
measurement can only be performed on the transmon qubit, the information in the storage cavity is decoded (DE) to the transmon qubit before
measurement. The Hadamard gate in the dashed-lined box is used selectively to sample the expectation values of different Pauli operators in
the target Hamiltonian.

PRINCIPLE AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
As shown in Fig. 1(a), we experimentally implement a
qubit-efficient VQE algorithm using a superconducting quan-
tum processor. The quantum system consists of a transmon
qubit (Q) dispersively coupled to a high-quality factor storage
cavity (S) [31–34]. The quantum algorithm is realized by a
sequence of single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates, driven by
the interactions between the transmon qubit and the storage
cavity. The Hamiltonian, including the driving term, can be
written as:
H = −χqsa†aσz/2+Ωq(t)σ+ +Ω∗
q(t)σ−+Ωs(t)a† +Ω∗
s(t)a,
(1)
where σz, σ+, σ−denote the Pauli operators of the transmon
qubit, a (a†) is the annihilation (creation) operator acting on
the photonic state in the storage cavity, χqs represents the coef-
ficient of the dispersive coupling, and Ω∗
q(t) and Ω∗
s(t) are the
complex drive amplitudes applied to the transmon qubit and
the storage cavity, respectively. The transmon qubit serves
as the reusable qubit, with its computational basis defined by
the ground state |g⟩and excited state |e⟩. The storage cav-
ity provides the photonic qubit, with its basis states defined
by the vacuum state |0⟩s and single photon number state |1⟩s.
Given the longer lifetime of the photonic qubit compared to
the transmon qubit, the photonic qubit effectively mediates
quantum entanglement throughout the quantum circuit. The
transmon qubit is readout via a stripline cavity, as denoted by
R in Fig. 1(a), which plays a crucial role in the error mitigation
techniques applied in this experiment.
Our experimental system manifests the simplest two-qubit
quantum system, while allowing the implementation of gen-
eral quantum algorithms through a qubit-efficient approach.
This approach leverages the reuse of the transmon qubit
throughout the process of VQE algorithm [21], drawing in-
spiration from tensor network representations, particularly
MPS [35, 36]. By efficiently compressing quantum state in-
formation while preserving accuracy, this technique enables
the simulation of larger systems with fewer qubits. In contrast
to traditional VQE methods, which typically require a direct
one-to-one mapping between qubits and quantum states, the
qubit-efficient approach reinitializes and reuses qubits at dif-
ferent stages of the computation, with mediating qubits pre-
serving the necessary entanglement between subsystems. The
MPS framework limits the bond dimension, which controls
the amount of entanglement captured, effectively balancing
the available qubit resources with the complexity of the quan-
tum state.
As shown in Fig. 1(b), the qubit-efficient VQE algorithm
is represented by N layers of a parameterized circuit imple-
mented on S and Q to generate an N +1-qubit state, with the
detailed configuration of each layer shown in the inset. The
gates in this circuit are specifically tailored to our hardware.
Single-qubit gates on the transmon qubit are executed via res-
onant drives, with each gate parameterized by the amplitude
and phase of the complex driving field Ω∗
q(t). Operations on
the photonic qubit, defined within the Fock state basis, are im-
plemented with the assistance of the transmon qubit, requiring
more intricate control on the composite system. Specifically,
the Hadamard gate on the photonic qubit is implemented us-
ing a numerically optimized pulse, while the phase gate is per-
formed by adjusting the phase of Ω∗
s(t) through frame changes
