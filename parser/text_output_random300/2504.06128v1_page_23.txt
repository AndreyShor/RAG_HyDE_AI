This follows by the weak convergence (4.2) once we show that positive moments are uniformly
bounded, say supNPN ErpZav
N q2hs ă 8 for all h P N (so that pZav
N qp is uniformly integrable).
We already know from Corollary 2.9 that VarrZav
N s is bounded, hence any moment ErpZav
N q2hs
is bounded too by Theorem 1.11 (the assumptions (1.29), (1.31) and (1.32) of Theorem 1.11
are satisfied by φ “ Up0,δϱ

Remark 4.1. The log-normality (4.2) is reminiscent of the corresponding result for the
point-to-plane partition function Zβ
Lp0q in the sub-critical regime β “ βsub-crit
L
, see (1.26)
with ˆβ P p0, 1q, that we proved in [CSZ17, Theorem 2.8]. As we described in Remark 1.10,
the heuristic behind (4.2) is that, after coarse-graining space on the scale δϱ
N

N and
time on the scale δ2ϱ
N N, the averaged partition function Zav
N in the quasi-critical regime
becomes comparable to a sub-critical point-to-plane partition function with disorder parameter

The key to the analysis of Zβsub-crit
L
L
p0q in the sub-critical regime in [CSZ17] was a multiscale
structure with time scales Lα for α P p0, 1q. We will see that the same multiscale structure
emerges in our analysis of Zav
N with corresponding time scales pδ2ϱ
N Nq Lα with L “ 1{δ2ϱ
N
and α P p0, 1q, see (4.5). This justifies the heuristic comparison just described.
We divide the proof of (4.2) into several steps.
Overall strategy. Let us fix a (large) integer M P N, which will be the number of
time scales. For technical reasons, we will first approximate the original partition function
Zav
N by switching off the disorder in suitable time strips, which defines Zoff
N in (4.15) and
provides some smoothing between consecutive time scales; we will then introduce almost
diffusive restrictions on the polymer paths, which defines Zdiff
N
in (4.24). We will show that
Zoff
N and Zdiff
N
(which also depend on M) are good approximations in the following sense:
@M P N :

(4.3)
Therefore to prove our goal (4.2), we can just replace Zav
N with Zdiff
N .
Remark 4.2. A similar idea of switching-off the noise in suitably chosen strips to obtain a
smoothing approximation was also used by Dunlap-Gu [DG22] in their treatment of nonlinear
SHE in a subcritical regime.
We introduce explicit time scales
0 “: N0 ă ˜N1 ! N1 ! ˜N2 ! N2 ! . . . ! ˜NM ! NM “ N .
(4.4)
We define Zoff
N by switching off the noise in the time strips p ˜Ni, Nis, see (4.15), then we
define Zdiff
N
by restricting polymer paths at times ˜Ni and Ni to an almost diffusive ball, see
(4.23) and (4.24). The scales Ni are defined as follows:
