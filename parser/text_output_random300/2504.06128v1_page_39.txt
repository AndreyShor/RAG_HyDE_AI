In the next subsection we will show that our goal (5.6) follows by (5.22).
Remark 5.10 (Comparison with [CSZ23a]). From the proof of [CSZ23a, Theorem 6.1]
one can extract a bound similar to (5.15), but with a different dependence on the boundary
conditions φ, ψ, namely the second and third lines of (5.15) are replaced by†

The bound (5.15) is better for two reasons:
‚ the quantity

ℓq is smaller than }ψ}8
››e´

ℓq and it allows for un-
bounded functions ψ;
‚ the power h ´ 1 in (5.15) is better than h in (5.23) in case D “ Drφs ! L, see (1.28):
for instance, if φ is a probability mass function supported on a ball of radius

5.3. Proof of Theorem 5.2. Given h P N and constants ˆt, c1, c1
2, c3 P p0, 8q, we
need to prove the bound (5.6) for all β ě 0 and L large enough, uniformly over probability
mass functions φ satisfying (5.2), (5.3), (5.5) and over arbitrary functions ψ on Z2. For
simplicity, we assume z0 “ 0 (it suffices to replace φ by φp ¨ ` z0q and likewise for ψ).
We will deduce (5.6) from (5.22). To apply Proposition 5.9, we note that β ď β0phq is
guaranteed by (5.9) if we take L ě Lh for Lh large enough (depending on h and ¯ϑ in (5.9),
hence on ˆt, c1, c3). We show below that condition (5.21) can be satisfied as follows:
(a) we first fix ˆλ ě 0 such that Γ P p0, 1
16s;
(b) then we pick q ě 4 with 2q Γ ď 1
2 (to discard the denominator 1 ´ 2q Γ ě 1
2 in (5.22)).
We can now apply the bound (5.15). We show below that
(c) for suitable constants C, C1 ă 8 (depending on h, ˆt, c1, c1
2, c3),
2q Γ ď C VarrZβ

(5.24)
Plugging these bounds into (5.22), in view of (5.2), we see that the RHS of (5.15) gives
precisely (5.6) with the constant

to an averaging on the system size from L to 2L which is performed in the proof.
