Figure 4.2: The non-singlet splitting functions at LO, NLO, NNLO, and aN3LO, normalized to the aN3LO
central value and with a linear scale on the x axis. In each case we show also the uncertainty due to
missing higher orders (MHOU) estimated by scale variation according to Refs. [152, 151].

Figure 4.3: The relative size of the uncertainty due to missing higher orders (MHOU) on the splitting
functions of Fig. 4.2.
previous approximation of Ref. [292], is shown in Fig. 4.2 at the first four perturbative orders as
a ratio to the aN3LO result. For each order we include the MHOU determined by scale variation
according to Refs. [152, 151] and recall that there are no IHOU in the non-singlet sector. As the
non-singlet splitting function are subdominant at small x we only show the plot with a linear
scale in x. The relative size of the MHOU is shown in Fig. 4.3.
Inspecting Figs. 4.2 and 4.3 reveals good perturbative convergence 2 for all values of x. Specifi-
cally, the differences between two subsequent perturbative orders are reduced as the accuracy
of the calculation increases, and, correspondingly, the MHOUs associated to factorization scale
variations decrease with the perturbative accuracy. Indeed, the MHOU appears to reproduce
well the observed behavior of the higher orders, with overlapping uncertainty bands between
subsequent orders except at LO at the smallest x values. Hence, the behavior of the perturbative
series suggests that the MHOU estimate based on scale variation at N3LO is reliable.
2Here and henceforth by “convergence” we mean that the size of the missing N4LO corrections is negligible
compared to the target accuracy of theoretical predictions, i.e. at the sub-percent level.
