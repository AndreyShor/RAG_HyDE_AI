Figure 1: (a) An illustration of a one-dimensional diﬀusion from some initial position (black
dashed line) to an absorbing boundary (gray dashed line). A continuous trajectory with FPT
τ is plotted in blue. A trajectory with resetting follows the blue curve until it is restarted, as
indicated by the orange dotted line. It then follows the orange plot and reaches the boundary
at time τr. (b) An illustration of a typical ⟨τ⟩r as a function of r, with a minimum (orange
rhombus) at resetting rate ropt. (c) An illustration of FPT distributions with and without
resetting, in orange and blue, respectively.
search processes was also studied experimentally.66–68
Figure 1(b) shows a typical example of the MFPT of processes accelerated by resetting as
a function of the resetting rate r. If introducing resetting at a small ﬁnite rate is guaranteed
to lead to acceleration, the MFPT ﬁrst decreases with r, until reaching a minimum at some
optimal resetting rate ropt. It then must increase with r since in the limit of r →∞the
system does not move at all, and we expect ⟨τ⟩r to diverge. While Figure 1(b) shows the
typical behavior, there are other cases, e.g., where the MFPT ﬁrst increases with r, reaches
a local maximum, and decreases at higher rates.39,69,70
Resetting is particularly useful when the FPT distribution f(τ) has a slowly decaying
tail. To better understand how resetting lowers the MFPT, observe the FPT distribution
plotted in blue in Figure 1(c). While there is a high probability of sampling short FPTs,
the distribution has a very broad tail (notice that it is plotted on a semi-logarithmic scale).
Resetting eliminates the trajectories with extremely long FPTs and the FPT distribution
decays much faster (orange), leading to a smaller MFPT.

Theory of stochastic resetting
In this section, we cover some of the theory of resetting we consider most relevant for en-
hanced sampling, and particularly the conditions underwhich a process is accelerated by
resetting.
