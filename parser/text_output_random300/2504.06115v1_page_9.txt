resolutions ρ : b
X →X where b
X is a complex manifold. However, such a small resolution b
X
is, in general, neither projective nor K¨ahler.
Let us ﬁx any choice b
X and denote the exceptional curves by Cp = ρ−1(p) for p ∈S. A
theorem by Werner [40] states that X admits some projective small resolution if and only if
the homology classes [Cp] ∈H2( b
X, Q) are non-trivial for all p ∈S. 8 Note that, since the
exceptional curves are holomorphic, the fact that one of them represents a class that is trivial
in H2( b
X, Q) also implies that there can not exist a K¨ahler form on b
X.
The situation where the homology classes of all of the exceptional curves are trivial in
H2( b
X, Q) corresponds to the case where X is Q-factorial, meaning that
rk Cl(X)/Pic(X) = 0 .
(2.3)
Here Cl(X) and Pic(X) are respectively the groups of Weil divisors and Cartier divisors, in
each case taken modulo principal divisors. A nice introduction to Q-factoriality and, more
generally, singularities of Calabi-Yau threefolds can be found in [19, 20] but the details won’t
be necessary for our applications.
We will be interested in the situation where X is Q-factorial but the homology classes of all
of the exceptional are non-trivial in H2( b
X, Z). In other words, we want all of the exceptional
curves to represent non-trivial torsion classes. We therefore introduce the following deﬁnition
of an almost generic Calabi-Yau threefold:
Deﬁnition 2.1. We say that a projective Calabi-Yau threefold X is “almost generic” if
1. X has isolated nodes S ⊂X as singularities and is smooth everywhere else,
2. and given any analytic small resolution ρ : b
X →X, the homology class of the exceptional
curve [ρ−1(p)] ∈H2( b
X, Z) is non-trivial and torsion for all p ∈S.
Since an almost generic Calabi-Yau threefold is Q-factorial, it always admits a smoothing
as a consequence of [42, Theorem 1.3].
In the following we will denote by e
X a smooth
deformation of an almost generic Calabi-Yau threefold X. The Euler characteristic of e
X is
related to that of b
X via
b
X = e
X + 2(#S) .
(2.4)
Let us point out that the quantity χ( b
X) appears to be an invariant among the MUM-
points in a given moduli space.
In our ﬁrst example, that is discussed in Section 4, we
have a MUM-point at z = 0 that corresponds on the A-model side to a nodal quintic X1
with #S = 54 nodes and the Euler characteristic of the generic smooth quintic is of course
χ( e
X1) = −200. The moduli space contains a second MUM-point at z = ∞which corresponds
on the A-model side to a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold Y1 with Euler characteristic χ(Y1) =
−200 + 2 · 54 = −92. The same type of relations hold for our other examples as well, as can
be seen in Table 1.
