1. Device fabrication and characterization 
1.1 Fabrication of the MoSe2/hBN/WS2 device 
The dual-gate MoSe2/hBN/WS2 heterostructure was fabricated by the dry transfer 
method[1]. Specifically, atomically thin flakes were exfoliated from bulk crystals onto 
280 nm SiO2/Si substrates, and identified by an optical microscope. All the flakes were 
picked up sequentially with a polymer stamp––a polycarbonate (PC) layer on a 
polypropylene-carbonate-coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate, and released 
onto a sapphire chip with prepatterned electrodes. The whole transfer process was 
performed in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. See the optical image of the device in Figure 
S1. 
 
Figure S1. The optical image of the device. (a) The green, purple and blue lines denote 
the sample edges of WS2, MoSe2 and inset hBN, respectively. The black lines indicate 
the top and bottom graphite gates. The scale bar is 10 μm. (b) Schematic of the device. 
1.2 Characterization of the MoSe2/hBN/WS2 device 
Figure S2a shows the PL spectrum at the heterostructure in the charge-neutral 
condition, exhibiting the AM and AW resonances with linewidths of 1.7 meV and 2.7 
meV, respectively. Figure S2b shows the Raman spectrum from monolayer WS2, 
monolayer MoSe2, and the overlapped region of both TMD monolayers, the last of 
which exhibits A1g mode from MoSe2 (242 cm-1) and E2g mode from WS2 (356 cm-1). 
Figure S2d displays the reflectance contrast mapping of the heterostructure. The gray 
circle marks the uniform area where the optical measurements were performed. Figure 
S2e-j show the AFM measurements of the thicknesses of top hBN, bottom hBN and 
inset hBN.
