Elimination of spurious oscillations on photoemission spectra

where Nb is the number of bound states of V (z), and the transition amplitudes for
bound and continuum states are
ai = ⟨φi | ψ(τ)⟩.

The diﬀerential probability of electron emission can be expressed as a function of the
electron momentum k or the kinetic energy E as
dP
dE = k dP
dk =
√
2E |ak|2 .

If the continuum states are degenerate, the photoelectron emission probability is

dE = k dP
dk =

where the amplitudes a(p)

correspond to the projections over the degenerate
eigenfunctions H0|φ(p)

If the TISE is solved numerically within a bounded (1D) spatial range (referred
to as “the box”), the Hamiltonian spectrum becomes L2 ﬁnite and discrete even in
the region where (E > 0). The diﬀerential photoelectron emission probability can be
recovered as
dP
dE ≃|an|2
∆En

En > 0 ,

where we have approximated the diﬀerential dE for a discrete energy bin of size ∆En,
which takes into account the density of states.
In this context, the index of the
eigenfunction n determines the parity of the eigenfunction. From Eq. (6), we can
express the total ionization probability Pion as follows:
Pion =

where the continuous integral over the energy was approximated for a discrete sum
involving the N −Nb eigenstates with En > 0.
2.3. Scattering projection method
We can alternatively project the ﬁnal state |ψ(t)⟩onto a diﬀerent basis of continuous
states, which have non-deﬁnite parity.
In this work, we propose the Scattering
Projection Method (SPM), in which the projection basis consists of scattering waves
that meet the appropriate asymptotic conditions.
Given that the one-dimensional
potential well is a short-range potential, the scattering waves with incoming (+)
boundary conditions—related to plane-wave incidence from the right (r) and from
the left (l)—asymptotically behave as follows:
Ψ(r,+)
k
(z) =
(

r
(k)e−ikz
if
z →−∞
e−ikz + R(+)
