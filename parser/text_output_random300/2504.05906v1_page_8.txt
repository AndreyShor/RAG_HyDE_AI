approach adopted for the disorder-free scenario, we begin our analysis by examining 
the energy eigenspectra of an isolated AAH chain under various input conditions 
characterized by different values of the interaction strengths u and g. The 
corresponding results are presented in Fig. 4, where we consider a half-filled band 
configuration for a one-dimensional AAH chain consisting of 30 atomic sites.

strengths. The results correspond to the half-filled band case.  
Figure 4(a) depicts the well-known energy band structure of a 1D AAH chain in 
the absence of any interaction. In this case, the energy levels associated with up-spin 
and down-spin electrons are exactly identical. This is expected, as the sub-
Hamiltonians governing the up and down spin channels are identical when both e-e 
and e-ph interactions are absent. Consequently, no spin-dependent asymmetry arises. 
The situation changes once the e-e interaction is introduced. As illustrated in Fig. 
4(b), the presence of disorder in conjunction with e-e interaction breaks the spin 
symmetry. As a result, the up-spin and down-spin energy channels no longer coincide, 
leading to a visible mismatch between their corresponding energy eigenvalues. This
