from macroscopic trends to game-based subpopulations and microscopic configurations —
and characterized both equilibrium states and transient dynamics.
Our results show that coupling individual behavior to an advantageous environment,
alongside resource constraints, robustly promotes cooperation. Specifically, the interplay of
the coupling parameter and the sucker’s payoff significantly raises the threshold at which
cooperation persists, increases the prevalence of cooperative clusters, and mitigates early
disadvantages faced by cooperators. And, the model reveals how richer resource endowments,
shaped by strategic behavior and environmental context, reinforce cooperative tendencies
and alter the distribution of cooperation across social groups. Moreover, from a system-level
perspective, we observed that the interaction between resource availability and strategic
dynamics yields unequal but structured resource distributions, with cooperators generally
occupying higher-resource regimes. Introducing mechanisms such as a minimum resource
guarantee further reduces inequality and enhances the persistence of cooperation. Finally,
we confirmed that the advantageous environment mechanism remains robust across different
network topologies, including small-world and random graphs.
Our findings underline the critical role of resource co-evolution and the individual’s envi-
ronment in shaping collective strategic behavior. While our model focuses on two canonical
games, future work could explore its extension to more diverse interaction types, such as the
Hawk-Dove Game or the Public Goods Game, and more intricate structures like multilayer
or higher-order networks. These avenues could deepen our understanding of how environ-
mental and structural factors jointly govern the emergence and sustainability of cooperation.
