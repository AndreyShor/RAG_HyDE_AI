opacity proﬁle. To check this impact, we use different MDI datasets102 and carry out a full
seismic reconstruction. The ﬁnal results are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 10 for Model 2,
showing that slight changes can be expected in the reconstructed opacity, but that the deviations
close to the BCZ are still largely dominant and signiﬁcant.
To summarize, the main assumption of the method is the underlying chemical composition
proﬁle of the model in the upper radiative layers. This proﬁle may vary due to a change in
the underlying physical properties of the model: individual relative abundances, transport of
chemicals, reference opacity tables for the calibration procedure (although some models leading
to a too low helium abundance in the CZ could be rejected on that base). The equation of
state and nuclear reactions have almost no impact on the results, while the dataset used for
