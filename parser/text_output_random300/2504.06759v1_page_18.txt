SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 5: SLIDING MODEL
Consider two layers of graphene that slide smoothly with respect to one another. To describe
the sliding process we introduce a parameter 0 ≤λ ≤3.
Supplementary Figure 5.
Two layers of graphene that slide smoothly with respect to one
another. The layers are BA, AA, AB, and BA stacked at λ = 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively. The green (blue)
region of radius a is the region within which the A (B) atom on layer J (red) experiences non-zero coupling
to the atoms on layer J + 1 (black).
