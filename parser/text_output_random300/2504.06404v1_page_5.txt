D. Apriori Costs (Regularisation) 
Additionally, to measurement data we consider properties of 
the model Parameters itself or relations between different model 
parameters. This is typically referred to as regularization or 
filtering depending on context. The regularization should be 
chosen in a way to prefer even assumptions about the tracks and 
ensures a solvable problem for missing measurement data. 
Intuitively, the regularization incentivizes a simpler track is 
preferred even if a complex track would fit the measurements 
slightly better. Praxis shows that this is even more important if 
we want to estimate all track states (position, velocity, 
acceleration) only based on positions without directly measuring 
velocities and accelerations. Without any regularization the 
solution starts to swing, especially in the derivatives. General 
rule of thumb: the less measurements we have and the worse the 
quality of the measurement data the higher the importance of the 
regularization. For typical vehicle trajectories we can make the 
following assumptions. 
• 
Smaller accelerations are more plausible 
• 
Smaller acceleration changes are more plausible 
• 
Locally smaller changes of changes are more plausible 
(curve drive) 
• 
… 
To easily formulate these conditions, we can exploit the 
structure of the physical spline. A smaller acceleration means 
that all coefficients except for the first two (initial position and 
initial velocity) are small. We call this a regularization of order 
zero of the physical spline. This results in the following  
𝑒# = 1
2 & 𝑐8 ⋅𝑤8
2 
𝑞8 = (0
…

Depending on vehicle geometries, lateral and longitudinal 
acceleration limits are roughly on a similar scale. Thus a good 
and simple option is to weigh penalties on x and y direction with 
a similar weight. 
Smaller acceleration changes would be called the order one 
regularization of the physical spline and be expressed with 
differences in the coefficients. Equation (19) adds costs for the 
difference between proceeding coefficients.

In (Fig. 5) we can see the effect of a higher regularisation 
weight of order zero and one. Looking closely at the right end 
we can see that the slope of the velocity goes to zero for order 
zero and stays for order one. For order two the curvature would 
stay.
