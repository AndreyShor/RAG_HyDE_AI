not an exhaustive list of all HGH-based pseudoions), where the 0.25, 0.095, 0.05 lines denote the threshold
probabilities for 1, 2, 3 rounds of amplifications respectively, and where the blue, orange, green markers denote
the l = 0, 1, 2 cases respectively, with the 3 points per color denoting the 3 eigenstates. Only in a few cases
does the success probability fall below the 2 round threshold. The results suggest that with a little fine-tuning
of the reference state parameters (by incorporating some α-dependence) to address low probability cases,
one can always construct a Type I reference state above the 2 round threshold for all HGH pseudoions.
This is what we assume in resource estimation. For the s ≥0 local terms, the success probabilities are
0.45, 0.41, 0.36, 0.31 for s = 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively, and so only require 1 round of amplification.

The success probability is shown in Fig. 10 where we see that the first 40 harmonics l = 0, ..., 39 all
require 1 round of amplitude amplification, which suffices for practical purposes relevant to this work.
Should higher harmonics be desired, either one may use the same reference state with more rounds of
amplification or alternatively construct a more refined reference, e.g. with more piecewise constant levels
below the max value which works well for the internal region inside the classical turning points, to bring
the success probability back above the 1 round threshold. As with all initial state preparation subroutines,
this preparation only occurs once to initialize the time-evolution for a given problem instance, and hence the
