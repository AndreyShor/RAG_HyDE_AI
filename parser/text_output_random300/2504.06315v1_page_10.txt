Figure 3: CRA and CRA blood flows.
• CRA Mean Blood Flow (BF): average blood flow in the central retinal artery, compared to clinical measure-
ments.
• CRA Peak Systolic and End-Diastolic BF: Maximum and minimum values of CRA BF.
• CRV Mean Blood Flow: Mean blood flow in the central retinal vein, considering different age groups.
• Mean Blood Pressures in the CRA (Pcra), retinal arterioles (Part), retinal venules (Pven) and CRV (Pcrv).
Table 4 presents model predictions alongside experimental reference values.
The model demonstrates a strong agreement with available clinical data for ocular circulation, particularly in
predicting CRA and CRV blood flow. The mean CRA blood flow predicted by the model (46.56 µl/min) is consistent
with experimental values reported in the literature, with minor deviations likely due to variations in assumed vessel
diameters.
The peak systolic and end-diastolic blood flows in the CRA are also well reproduced, with the model predicting
slightly higher values than some clinical measurements. This may stem from differences in experimental conditions
or assumptions regarding systemic blood pressure fluctuations. Similarly, CRV blood flow values match well with
reference data, reinforcing the model’s ability to capture venous return dynamics.
Regarding pressures, these are not commonly available in standard clinical settings due to the difficulty of mea-
surement. Therefore, we compared our predictions with those from a previously validated mathematical model [10],
which is in agreement with our approach, to verify consistency.
In conclusion of this part, while minor deviations exist, the model successfully replicates cardiovascular and
ocular circulation metrics, supporting its validity. Refinements in parameter estimation and integration of additional
experimental data could further enhance predictive accuracy, particularly in capturing inter-individual variability.

Predictive scenarios
To investigate the effects of varying physiological parameters on both the cardiovascular and ocular systems, we
conducted three simulations (A, B, and C), each focusing on different aspects of system dynamics. The key parameters
we considered for this prediction study were the left ventricle compliance (LVc) and the IOP. Their values were
adjusted to reflect physiological variations and assess their impact on the system at a global and a local level.
Simulation A: impact of an increase in IOP on the Eye2Heart model
In this scenario, we investigated the effect of varying IOP from 15 mmHg to 30 mmHg. This study is motivated by clin-
ical insights highlighting the crucial role of venous circulation and the collapsibility of veins in ocular hemodynamics
