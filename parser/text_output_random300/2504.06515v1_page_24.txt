This behaviour can be captured in a ﬂat-space model as follows.
Consider the
two-velocity
uµ = (h(στ),
q
h2(στ) −1)
(126)
where h(στ) is some function and
ds2 = −dt2 + dx2
(127)
is the ﬂat metric. The general expression for the two-acceleration is
aµ = duµ
dτ = σh′(1,
h
p
h2(στ) −1
)
(128)
whose magnitude is
a · a =
(σh′)2
h2(στ) −1
(129)
where h′ = dh(τ)/dτ. Noting that u · u = 1 and a · u = 0, we have the following possi-
ble scenarios:
1.
As τ →∞, h →h0 where h0 is ﬁnite. In this case, the particle never becomes light-like.
2.
As τ →∞, h →∞. In this case, the particle becomes light-like, but this happens in
an inﬁnite amount of proper time (and coordinate time). The standard example is
h = cosh(στ), the constant acceleration example.
3.
The function h →∞as τ →τ0, where τ0 is ﬁnite. In this case, the particle asymptotes
to a light-like trajectory in a ﬁnite amount of proper time, but an inﬁnite amount of
coordinate time; an example is h = sec(στ). The acceleration increases as a function of
proper time, diverging at τ = τ0. This last situation is realized by the exact solutions
(123) with Λ > Λc.
The proper time τ∞at which the particles attain inﬁnite separation r −→∞is

Figure 7. Trajectories of unbounded motion for the same parameters as in Figure 6. At early times, the
two particles are in casual constant (left panel), but null rays emitted from particle 2 for proper times
κm0T ≥3.4 will never reach particle 1, as shown by the dashed and dot-dashed lines of positive slope
in the left panel. Null rays emitted in the opposite direction asymptote to curves that are parallel to
the asymptotic trajectory of particle 2. As the emission time T from particle 2 increases, the null rays
experience increasing effective repulsion, with those emitted toward particle 1 eventually reversing
their directions to asymptote to curves that are parallel to the asymptotic trajectory of particle 2,
as shown in the right panel. The null rays emitted in the opposite direction follow too close to the
trajectory of particle 2 to be distinguished in the ﬁgure in the right panel.
