where
Σ(A, B; C) ≡A{ ∂B

(2.6)
and
τ(A, B) ≡∂A
∂σ3 B −∂B
∂σ3 A.
(2.7)
Thus, the volume-preserving deformation (VPD) takes the form:
δVPDXI ≡{Q1, Q2, XI} = {τ(Q1, Q2), XI} + ∂XI
∂σ3 {Q1, Q2} + Σ(Q1, Q2; XI).
(2.8)
As is evident from this reformulation using the Poisson bracket, if this is
directly applied to the canonical commutation relations, the composition rule of
transformations would be violated. This reﬂects the fact that the Fundamental
Identity (F.I.) of the Nambu bracket is broken under quantization.
If the volume-preserving deformation (VPD) is restricted to a certain sub-
class that operates under the Poisson bracket, which we refer to as the restricted
volume-preserving deformation (RVPD), then it becomes possible to achieve a
Lorentz-covariant quantization of the membrane while preserving Lorentz co-
variance. In the following sections, we demonstrate this explicitly

In this study, we further gauge-ﬁx the volume-preserving deformation (VPD)
to ensure that, even when the deformation is incorporated into the canonical
commutation relations as a restricted deformation, the composition rule remains
intact. Our goal is to retain only those deformations with well-behaved proper-
ties.
We refer to such a restricted volume-preserving deformation as RVPD (Re-
stricted Volume-Preserving Deformation) and denote it by δRXI. When speci-
fying the associated charges explicitly, we write this as δR(Q1,Q2)XI.
The ﬁrst essential property of a well-behaved deformation is linearity, ex-
pressed as:
δR(λ1A1 + λ2A2 + . . . ) = λ1δRA1 + λ2δRA2 + . . .
(3.1)
Next, it is natural to require that the deformation is distributive, satisfying:
examining the matrix regularization of strings, it is also meaningful to ﬁrst consider the quan-
tization of the Nambu bracket within Takhtajan’s action before proceeding to the matrix
regularization of the membrane.
Regarding the quantization of Takhtajan’s action, Sakakibara discussed it from the per-
spective of deformation quantization [21], and later, Matsuo and Shibusa explored canonical
quantization in the x3 = σ gauge [22].
