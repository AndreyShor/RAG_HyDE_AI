Four-arm events for SLE
As a corollary of our estimates for CLEκ, we also deduce analogous results on a general form of
four-arm events for SLEκ, defined in the following.
• (Boundary four-arm event for SLE) Let η be a chordal SLEκ in H from 0 to ∞. For 1 > r >
ε > 0, let τ1 be the first time that η hits Bε(1), let σ1 be the first time after τ1 that η hits
∂Br(1), and let τ2 be the first time after σ1 that η hits Bε(1). We introduce
W+
4 (ε, r) := {τ2 < ∞}.
(1.5)
• (Interior four-arm event for SLE) Let η be a chordal SLEκ in D from 1 to a ∈∂D \ {1}. For
1 > r > ε > 0, let τ1 be the first time that η hits Bε, let σ1 be the first time after τ1 that η
hits ∂Br, and let τ2 be the first time after σ1 that η hits Bε. We introduce
W4(a, ε, r) := {τ2 < ∞}.
(1.6)
Theorem 1.3. For κ ∈(8/3, 4], 1 > r > ε > 0 and a ∈∂D \ {1}, we have, as ε →0,
P[W+
4 (ε, r)] ≍εξ+
4 (κ),
(1.7)
P[W4(a, ε, r)] ≍εξ4(κ).
(1.8)
The implicit constants in (1.7) (resp. (1.8)) only depend on κ, r (resp. κ, a, r).
We would like to make the following remarks, to compare our results to previous results on SLE
arm exponents obtained in [42].
• We recall in Section 6.1 the precise definitions of the boundary 2j-arm events Hα
2j−1(ε, x, y, r),
Hα
2j(ε, x, y, r) and the interior 2j-arm events E2j(ε, z, y, r) considered in [42]. These definitions
are very restrictive on the topology of the crossings, in the sense that they need to hit exactly
a specific arc each time. For instance, for the case of four-arm events, Theorem 1.3 implies
up-to-constant upper bounds on the events in Figures 1.3 and 1.4, which were not considered
in [42]. On the other hand, the lower bounds in (1.7) and (1.8) can be deduced from [42].

Figure 1.3: We depict three simple cases of boundary four-arm events (the two half-disks, centered
on x and y, have respective radii ε and r). None of them belongs to the event Hα
3 (ε, x, y, r) or
Hα
4 (ε, x, y, r) considered in [42]: roughly speaking, the curve does not hit the right arcs in the right
order (see (6.1) and (6.2) for precise definitions). Our Theorem 1.3 implies in particular that their
probabilities are upper-bounded by a constant times εξ+
4 (κ).
