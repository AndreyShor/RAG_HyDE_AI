Weyl semimetals over Brillouin platycosms
From Tab. S1, we observe that the Brillouin platycosms Mα, where α = 1, 2, 3, 4, are nonorientable, meaning there
is no globally consistent orientation. Nonorientability allows all Weyl points in the fundamental domain to share the
same relative chirality, and therefore the total chirality can be any even integer. To illustrate this, we take k-space
Pna21 as an example.
The Bloch Hamiltonian for the lattice model shown in Fig. S10(d), which exhibits k-space Pna21 symmetry, can
be written as

FIG. S11: Illustration of shapes and band structures of Fermi arcs. (a-c) show values of gaps between valence bands and
conduction bands with open boundary conditions in x, y and z directions.
Weyl points with chirality ±1 are labeled by
blue(red) points respectively. In figures (d-f), corresponding band structures of Fermi arcs are presented.
The fundamental domain under the action of the Pna21 symmetry can be chosen as [−π, π] × [−π, 0] × [−π, 0]. As
shown in Figs. S11(a), (b), and (c), there are 8 Weyl points in the entire Brillouin zone, with 2 Weyl points in the
fundamental domain. The total chirality of the two Weyl points in the fundamental domain is χ = 2.
When projected onto the surface Brillouin zone, Fermi arcs connect Weyl points with opposite chirality.
For
instance, when open boundary conditions(OBC) are applied in the x direction, the Weyl points in the fundamental
domain are projected into a region constrained by −π ≤ky ≤0 and −π ≤kz ≤0. The surface Hamiltonian exhibits
momentum-space glide symmetry Gy and half-translation symmetry along the diagonal direction, denoted by Lyz.
Since the half-translation symmetry originates from the projection of glide symmetry Gx, its action also changes the
chirality of the Weyl points. As a result, the four Weyl points in the region 0 ≤ky ≤π, related to the Weyl points
in the fundamental domain by Gy and Lyz, have opposite chirality (χ = −1). Also, similar arguments hold for cases
with OBC in y or z directions, only with symmetry constraints different.
