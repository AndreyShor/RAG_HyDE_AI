symmetry and gauge that symmetry, for any of the three choices of ﬁber functors
we recover two copies of the parent theory and the anomalous Z2 does not show
up in any gaugings, which veriﬁes that the Rep(D4) is gaugeable/non-anomalous
as claimed. The extra phases which appear in the partition function to make this
possible stem from non-trivial anyon braidings in the SymTFT, again matching
what we saw in the group-like case.

Anomalous Z2 extended to Rep(Q8)
We can craft a second example similar to the above one by looking at the represen-
tation category of the quaternion group Q8. We present the eight elements of the
group as {1,−1,i,−i,j,−j,k,−k} with {i,j,k} the order four generators and {1,−1}
the center. This group has ﬁve irreducible representations, which we will denote
{1,a,b,c,m}. The irreps a, b and c are one-dimensional and have kernels which
we will take to be i, j and k, respectively, while m is the lone two-dimensional
irrep. All together, these ﬁve irreps form the same fusion ring as Rep(D4); it is the
associator of Rep(Q8) which distinguishes it from Rep(D4) as a fusion category.
The SymTFT for such a symmetry contains operators given by the Drinfeld
center Z(Q8).
As with D4, we can easily write down these anyons which are
labeled by a conjugacy class and an irrep of its centralizer. Q8 has ﬁve conjugacy
classes:
[1] = {1},
[−1] = {−1},
[i] = {i,−i},
[j] = {j,−j},
[k] = {k,−k}.
(7.11)
The ﬁrst two of these have the entire group as centralizers, while the latter three
have Z4 centralizers. This leads to a total of 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 anyons, which
are summarized in Table 8. Here we have denoted the irreps of Z4 as {1,i,−1,−i}.
We also have indicated the topological spin which describes the lines’ self-braiding.
Note that only the 12 bosons, i.e. anyons with spin 1, can appear in condensable
algebras.
