depends on the quantities max0≤t≤T ∥x(t)∥2 and C(A), while the LCHS method depends on ∥b∥2T. When
β = 2/3, both methods exhibit the same dependence on precision, but the overall complexity is determined
by the specific choice of A, b, and x0.

Numerical comparison
In this section, we present numerical experiments to compare our method with the method based on
Taylor approximation.

We construct Cm,k,1(Ah) and Lm,k,1(Ah), and solve the corresponding linear systems for different values of
m. The results, including relative solution error, condition number, and the success probability Psucc, are
shown in Fig. 12.
The left figure demonstrates that the method based on Padé approximation can achieve high relative
accuracy with a relatively small m, while the method based on Taylor approximation requires a much larger
m to achieve similar accuracy. The middle figure reveals that the condition number of our newly proposed
method is at a low level for all values of m, while the condition number of the Taylor approximation-based
method can become extremely large if m is not large enough. This observation aligns with our theoretical
analysis. The right figure compares the success probability Psucc. The method based on Padé approximation
achieves high success probabilities for smaller values of m, while the success probabilities of both methods
converge to nearly the same value as m increases sufficiently.
In summary, the first experiment demonstrates that the method based on Taylor approximation becomes
unstable when m is not large enough, while the method based on Padé approximation provides satisfactory
results even for relatively small m.
Experiment 2: The advantage of our newly proposed method becomes more pronounced as the time interval
length T increases. To demonstrate this, we fix the accuracy ϵ = 10−10 and the approximation order k = 9,
and investigate how the optimal choice m∗(the smallest m required to achieve the desired accuracy) changes
with T for both methods. With the parameters k = 9, p = 1, and m = m∗, we construct and solve the
corresponding linear systems. We also compute the condition number and success probability Psucc for these
linear systems. The results are shown in Fig. 13.
