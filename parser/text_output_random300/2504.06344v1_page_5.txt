The ∆-expansion: As shown in [23], one can analytically construct self dual, nonabelian-
and non-constant-F solutions with Q = r/N on a T4 whose periods are detuned away from
∆= 0, using a series expansion in
√
∆.
Schematically, one writes the deformed-T4 (i.e. the one with small nonzero ∆) background
as the constant-F background ¯A of (1.2) plus general fluctuations S, W covering the entire
SU(N) (omitting the spacetime index µ for brevity):
A = ¯A + ωSω +

where Sk,ℓare in SU(k) and SU(ℓ) respectively and Sω is in U(1)ω, recall (1.1). One then
imposes self duality on the field strength of A, along with the background gauge condition
Dµ( ¯A)Aµ = 0.
Solving the nonlinear self-duality condition, which is explicitly given later in the paper,6
is done consistently via an iterative procedure, using a power series in ∆.
One expands
S (denoting either ω, k, ℓcomponent) and W in powers of ∆p and ∆p+ 1
2 , p = 0, 1, 2, ...,
respectively,
S ∼S(0) + ∆S(1) + ...,
W ∼
√
∆(W(0) + ∆W(1) + ...),
(1.5)
showing only the few lowest-order terms. We now state the salient features of the ∆-expansion:
1. The S(0) ω,k,ℓterms are constant pieces omitted from (1.2). These represent the only
allowed holonomies, the ones commuting with the transition functions. The fact that,
as shown in [1], there are only 4gcd(k, r) such nonvanishing holonomies is important in
what follows. These holonomies become moduli of the nonabelian solution.
2. One can show that the nonlinear self-duality equations for A of (1.4) can be solved
iteratively. One begins with W(0), which is determined by ¯A and S(0). Then, one finds
that S(1) is determined by ¯A, S(0) and W(0). This iterative procedure continues to any
desired order in ∆, but higher orders quickly become analytically cumbersome to treat.7
The solution is nonabelian and the field strength is non-constant on the torus. For
r > 1, gcd(k, r) = r, and to leading nontrivial order in ∆, it exhibits instanton-liquid
like appearance of strongly overlapping r lumps [1].
3. The ∆-expansion has been confronted with the “exact” fractional instanton, the one
obtained by minimizing the lattice action with twists. This was done already in [23]
for r = 1, N = 2 (here only k = ℓ= 1 are possible). The agreement with the numerics,
even upon keeping only the leading W(0) term, is remarkable, for values of ∆as large
as 0.02 −0.09.
6The nonlinear self-duality conditions are similar to eqns. (2.18) with λ = 1, but with an extra constant
term ∼∆on the r.h.s. of the first two equations (which can be found in [1]).
7For a study of an analogous expansion for self-dual vortices in two dimensions, where high orders can be
computed more easily, see [24].
