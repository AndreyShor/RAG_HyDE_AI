Entanglement measures
For a state ρAB in the space of states in the Hilbert space of the combined system, an entanglement measure, denoted as
E(ρAB ), is defined as a mapping from the space of states to the set of non-negative real numbers (R+). The entanglement
measure must satisfy the following conditions: E(ρAB ) = 0 if ρAB represents a separable state. Additionally, E(ρAB)
should not, on average, increase under local operations and classical communications (LOCC). Measuring entanglement
is a broad and dynamic area of research in its own right, with many different approaches suggested for quantifying
it. The entanglement of formation, intended to assess the resources needed for creating a particular entangled state,
is recognized as one of the most fundamental measures [90]. Since the entanglement of formation rises monotonically
with the concurrence, determining the concurrence C of the detectors’ final state suffices to measure the amount of
entanglement between them [90]. It provides a bound on the entanglement. The concurrence is defined by
C[ρAB] := max[0, λ1 −λ2 −λ3 −λ4],
(73)
where the λs are the square roots of the eigenvalues of ρAB ˜ρAB in decreasing order. Here, ˜ρAB is defined as (σy ⊗
σy)ρ∗
AB(σy ⊗σy), and σy represents the usual Pauli matrix. Substituting the λs for the reduced density matrix ρAB,
shown in (60), in Eq.(73) one obtains [11; 13]
C[ρAB] = 2 max[0, |M| −
p
LAALBB] + O(λ4).
(74)
Other forms of quantum correlations, such as quantum discord, which quantifies the overall quantumness of correla-
tions, also play an important role in relativistic quantum information. We also compute the quantum mutual information,
which measures the total correlation between two probes. For a quantum bipartite system, it is defined to be the relative
entropy between ρAB and ρA ⊗ρB [11; 13; 91]
I[ρAB] := S(ρAB|ρA ⊗ρB) = S(ρA) + S(ρB) −S(ρAB).
(75)
Here S(..) denotes the von Neumann entropy, and it is given by the following expressions: S(ρAB) = −TrAB(ρAB log ρAB),
S(ρA) = −TrA(ρA log ρA), and S(ρB) = −TrB(ρB log ρB). By expanding Eq. (75) for mutual information to the leading
order in terms of the coupling strength λ, one gets
I[ρAB] = L+ log L+ + L−log L−−LAA log LAA −LBB log LBB + O(λ4)
(76)
where,
L± = 1
2(LAA + LBB ±

(LAA −LBB)2 + 4LABLBA).
(77)
In the next subsection, we compute the mutual information, and the concurrence for two UDW detectors kept along a
given trajectory.

Vacuum correlations outside the horizon
In the context of a free scalar field in Minkowski spacetime, when we choose to decompose the state space into plane-
wave modes, the overall Hilbert space takes the form of a direct product of infinitely countable harmonic oscillator state
spaces, each corresponding to a distinct mode k. Consequently, the resultant state appears as a product state rather than
an entangled one. However, an alternative approach involves utilizing a tensor product of two-mode squeezed (TMS)
states in pairs of Rindler modes, which gives rise to entangled Rindler wedges. Additionally, one can also represent the
quantum field’s state as a path-ordered or time-ordered exponential operator, acting on local degrees of freedom at each
point in space, using variational ans¨atze like continuous matrix-product states (cMPS) and the continuous multiscale
entanglement renormalization ansatz (cMERA) [92; 93]. Such an approach allows for the interpretation of the vacuum
state as a multipartite entangled state [94]. There could be multiple possible choices based on the natural choice for the
Hilbert space decomposition, which depends upon the reference frame. Hence, the entanglement harvested by the detector
is also expected to depend upon trajectory. In this section and the subsequent ones, we delve into the entanglement
characteristics of the multipartite entangled state, employing the assistance of two Unruh-DeWitt (UDWs) detectors
positioned at distinct locations and following various trajectories.
