Abstract. The Critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) provides a natural candidate
solution to the ill-posed 2D Stochastic Heat Equation with multiplicative space-time white
noise. In this paper, we initiate the investigation of the spatial properties of the SHF. We
prove that, as a random measure on R2, it is a.s. singular w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. This
is obtained by probing a “quasi-critical” regime and showing the asymptotic log-normality
of the mass assigned to vanishing balls, as the disorder strength is sent to zero at a suitable
rate, accompanied by similar results for critical 2D directed polymers. We also describe
the regularity of the SHF, showing that it is a.s. Hölder C´ε for any ε ą 0, implying the
absence of atoms, and we establish local convergence to zero in the long time limit.
The picture on the left is a simulation of the Critical 2D SHF and illustrates its singularity.
The picture on the right is a simulation in the quasi-critical regime, slightly below the
critical window, which is smoother and will be used to approximate the Critical 2D SHF.
1. Introduction
The Critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) was constructed in [CSZ23a] as a family
of measure-valued processes Z ϑ
t pdxq with disorder strength parameter ϑ P R, which give
non-trivial solutions to the ill-defined two-dimensional Stochastic Heat Equation (SHE)
