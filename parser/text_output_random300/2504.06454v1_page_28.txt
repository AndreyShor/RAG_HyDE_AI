(TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 system, the ﬁshtail eﬀect arises from the precipitation of nano-
sized phases (∼10 nm), which signiﬁcantly improves Jc at higher ﬁelds. Conversely, the
absence of nano-sized precipitates in Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 and NbScTiZr leads
to rapid Jc degradation under elevated ﬁelds. Therefore, the synergy between eutec-
tic microstructure with lattice strain and nano-sized precipitates oﬀers a promising
pathway to achieving superior Jc values across a wide range of magnetic ﬁelds.

In considering the application as a superconducting wire, a comparison of Tc,
µ0Hc2(0), and Jc between HEAs and Nb-Ti alloys is essential. The Tc and µ0Hc2(0)
values of the NbTi alloy are 10 K and 14.5 T, respectively[92]. Although the µ0Hc2(0)
value of NbScTiZr is comparable to that of the NbTi alloy, slightly lower µ0Hc2(0) val-
ues are reported for many HEAs (see Table 1). The Tc value of NbScTiZr is the highest
among the HEAs; however, it remains 1 to 2 K lower than that of the Nb-Ti alloy.
Hence, the pursuit of enhancing Tc without compromising µ0Hc2(0) emerges as the
next area of research. Figures 26(a) and (b) also depict the magnetic ﬁeld dependence
of Jc for Nb-Ti superconductors. The red triangles denote Jc data for a commer-
cial Nb–47 wt.%Ti alloy reported in the 1980s[93]. The red squares and open circles
represent the ﬁeld-dependent Jc of Nb-Ti multiﬁlamentary strands[94] and the state-
of-the-art Nb-Ti wire employed in accelerators[95], respectively. At 2 K, NbScTiZr
and (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 exhibit Jc values comparable to those of the 1980s commer-
cial Nb–47 wt.%Ti alloy within the presented magnetic ﬁeld range. The low-ﬁeld Jc
values at 4.2 K for NbScTiZr are nearly identical to those of Nb-Ti multiﬁlamentary
strands. However, a pronounced deviation occurs as the magnetic ﬁeld increases, likely
attributable to the lower Tc of NbScTiZr relative to the Nb-Ti alloy and diﬀerences in
sample morphology (bulk: NbScTiZr, multiﬁlamentary strands: Nb-Ti). To achieve Jc
values comparable to those of the state-of-the-art Nb-Ti wire used in accelerators, an
enhancement of at least an order of magnitude is required across both low and high-
ﬁeld regimes. Therefore, further research eﬀorts, including in-depth investigations of
