However, when information about the progress of the process is available, state-dependent
resetting protocols can provide greater acceleration.
The theory of resetting provides a powerful tool to analyze trajectories without resetting
and decide: will resetting accelerate my sampling and by how much? What is the optimal
rate, and how can I obtain additional acceleration by using smart adaptive resetting strate-
gies? For trajectories already accelerated by some algorithm of enhanced sampling, it is
even easier to know whether resetting can be helpful. It requires zero computational eﬀort,
only the ﬁrst moments of the FPT distribution in the case of standard resetting and some
samples of trajectories for informed resetting. Finally, resetting is trivially parallelizable.
When considering parallel simulations, resetting has a great advantage: for instance, if we
initiate simulations without resetting and stop them when observing ﬁrst-passage, even a
single trajectory with an extremely long FPT delays us. We can better exploit our resources
by employing resetting, decreasing the real-time sampling duration by orders of magnitude.
