This section presents the stability and convergence analysis of the neural network for both models. For convenience,
let 𝑢𝜃= 𝑈.

Stability of multilayer neural network
Here, 𝐿∞bounds are derived for both models.
Theorem 2.3. Let 𝑈be a neural network solution to the equation
𝜕𝑈
𝜕𝑡= 1

𝜕2𝑈
𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑅(𝑈),
(2.41)
where the reaction term 𝑅(𝑈) satisfies the Lipchitz condition Appendix E.6 along with one of the following conditions:
• (i) Linear growth condition: If there exists a constant 𝐶> 0 such that
|𝑅(𝑈)|⩽𝐶(1 + |𝑈|),
(2.42)
then 𝑈is uniformly bounded in 𝐿2(D), i.e., there exists a constant 𝑀> 0 such that
sup
𝑡∈[0,𝑇]
∥𝑈(𝑡)∥𝐿2(D)⩽𝑀.
(2.43)
• (ii) Exponential decay condition
|𝑅(𝑈)|⩽𝐶𝑒−𝛼𝑈,
(2.44)
for some constants 𝐶, 𝛼> 0. Then 𝑈is uniformly bounded in 𝐿∞(D) and satisfies the estimate:
sup
𝑡∈[0,𝑇]
∥𝑈(𝑡)∥𝐿∞(D)⩽𝐶′𝑒−𝛽𝑡∥𝑈0∥𝐿2(D),
(2.45)
for some constant 𝐶′ > 0, decay rate 𝛽> 0 and initial condition 𝑈0.
Proof. Multiplying the equation (2.41) by 𝑈and integrating over D:
