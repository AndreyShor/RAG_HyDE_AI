Clearly the result now follows by virtue of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
This elementary result reveals the simple connection to Nelsonâ€™s mechanical paths
satisfying a version of Newtonâ€™s 2nd Law. As a simple application of this elegant formula
we can investigate the behaviour of uÏƒ(x, t) as Ïƒ â†’0. Consider the family of uniformly
bounded continuous matrix valued functions,
MT :=

where the products in the multiple integrals are ordered strictly increasing in times tj
and the infinite series converge in MT, i.e. uniformly for t âˆˆ[0, T).
Lemma 5.3. Suppose that A âˆˆMT, then exp+ A(s) solves the initial value problem,

Proof. Given that A âˆˆMT, then the first part follows by a simple calculation from
the definition of exp+ and the fact that an infinite series can be differentiated term by
term if the differentiated terms are continuous and the differentiated series is uniformly
convergent. Thus,
