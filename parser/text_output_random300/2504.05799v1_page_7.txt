and varied parameters (|A|, |µ|) ∈[−3 ÷ 3] × MSUSY and ϕ ∈(0, 2π) reveal no acceptable
parameter region satisfying the corresponding alignment limit conditions. It is easily to provide
mh1=95 GeV, mh2=125 GeV but the alignment conditions for mass relations are never satisﬁed.
Thus only the Higgs alignment limit hI
1 is realized in framework of the MSSM.
The alignment limit conditions (11a) allow to predict CP-violating interactions of Higgs
bosons with SM particles in general form. Analyzing (10) we can notice that CPV signals may
be observed only in interactions of h3 with SM fermions if the value a33 is large enough.

satisfying the alignment limit conditions hI
1, we scan it and obtain model regimes (benchmark
scenarios, BS). Numerical analysis is performed in framework of EFT-approach (see [6, 28, 33]
and Refs therein) in the approximation of degenerate squark masses of third generation5. The
CP-violating phase ϕ is an input parameter deﬁned by (12). We ﬁx
tan β = {2, 5, 10, 20},
MSUSY = {2.5, 5, 10} TeV,
mH± = {300, 3000} GeV
(15)
and varied parameters (|A|, |µ|) ∈[−3 ÷ 3] × MSUSY in such a way that the alignment limit hI
1
(mh1=125 GeV, β −α ≃π/2, c1 ≃0) is satisﬁed.
No allowed region for tan β < 5 is found.
The large mass of the charged Higgs boson
mH± ≥MS is more preferable. In this case all additional Higgs bosons decouple and are nearly
degenerated. Obtained benchmark scenarios are presented in Table 1. Note that BS3 is close
to the benchmark scenario CPX4LHC proposed in [25] in the case µ = 2MSUSY, however, the
obtained alignment limit conditions, (11a), rule out the mass mH± up to 4 TeV.
Within these scenarios the dependence of a33 can be analyzed. It turns out that prediction
for a33 is insensitive to mH± and almost constant. The obtained values are presented in Table 1.
We can conclude straightforwardly [see (10)] that rather signiﬁcant CPV interactions of h3 with
up-fermions take place in scenarios BS2 and BS4.

Conclusion
We have considered the two-Higgs doublet sector with explicit CP-violation where the eﬀective
Coleman-Weinberg type and RG-improved Higgs potential are analyzed within the framework
of decomposition up to dimension-six operators. We have also implemented the threshold cor-
rections to the MSSM RG running, induced by dimension-six operators. We have found that the
mass shifts of a light neutral Higgs scalar h are negligible for stable values of At,b/MSUSY ≤3,
µ/MSUSY ≤3 and are about 10 GeV at mA ∼MEW or negligible at mA ∼MSUSY for unstable
values At,b/MSUSY > 3, µ/MSUSY > 3.
5Note that the most accurate and complete computations of Higgs boson masses within the EFT approach
can be implemented in framework of the CPsuperH3.0 [25, 43]. However, assuming the theoretical uncertainty
of mh1 = 125 ± 2 GeV we restrict ourself by the approximation mentioned above.
