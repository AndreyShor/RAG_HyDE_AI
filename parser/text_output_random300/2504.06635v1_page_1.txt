Abstract: We consider a most general SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs model consist of terms up
to quadratic in ﬁrst-derivative of the ﬁelds, that is the generalized SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs
with additional scalars-dependent coupling θ-term. Using the BPS Lagrangian method we
try to ﬁnd Bogomolnyi’s equations for BPS monopoles and dyons by taking most general
BPS Lagrangian density. We obtain more general Bogomolnyi’s equations and a relation
between all scalars dependent couplings. Interestingly we ﬁnd the value of θ-term’s coupling
gives additional contribution to electric charge of BPS Dyons, and thus can determine
whether we get BPS monopoles or BPS dyons.
