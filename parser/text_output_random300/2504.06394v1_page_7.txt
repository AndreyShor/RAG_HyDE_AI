the rotating frame, ˆu(ˆ𝑟= ˆ𝑎) = 0. We require a second set of boundary conditions where the
cupula and the endolymph meet. The kinematic boundary condition requires that the cupular
velocity and the endolymph velocity at the surface of the cupula must match. As the spatial
gradients of the cupula’s deformation are small, we can write this as
𝜕ˆ𝜂
𝜕ˆ𝑡𝒆𝑠= ˆu(ˆ𝑟, ˆ𝑠= 0, ˆ𝑡) = ˆu(ˆ𝑟, ˆ𝑠= 2𝜋𝑅, ˆ𝑡).
(2.7)
We also require boundary conditions for the plate equation (2.6). The precise attachment
between the cupula and the utricle is an open area of research and the conditions to be
satisfied are not immediately clear. We opt to implement a straightforward choice suggested
by Rabbitt & Damiano (1992), which is to apply clamped boundary conditions at the edge
of the cupula, i.e.
ˆ𝜂(ˆ𝑟= ˆ𝑎(0)) = 𝜕ˆ𝜂
𝜕ˆ𝑟

ˆ𝑟= ˆ𝑎(0)
= 0.
(2.8)
We also require initial conditions for the velocity, ˆu(ˆx, ˆ𝑡= 0) and the cupular deflection
ˆ𝜂(ˆ𝑟, 𝜃, ˆ𝑡= 0). Unless otherwise stated we assume that the system is initially at rest and is
undeformed.
2.4. Scalings and non-dimensionalization
The SCCs in mammals are thin and slender: with an aspect ratio 𝜖= 𝑎/𝑅between 0.05
and 0.1 (Daocai et al. 2014). It is therefore natural to exploit 𝜖≪1 and use an asymptotic
approach to perform a long wavelength asymptotic analysis similar to lubrication theory. We
also know from the continuity equation that if ˆ𝑤∼U then ˆ𝑢, ˆ𝑣∼𝜖U. This is required to have
a non-trivial balance and is a typical scaling in lubrication theory (Craster & Matar 2006;
Papageorgiou 1995). To make this asymptotic intuition more formal, we non-dimensionalize,
scaling the dimensional variables according to:
ˆ𝑟= 𝑎𝑟,
ˆ𝑠= 𝑅𝑠,
ˆ𝑡= T𝑡,
ˆ𝑤= 𝑅¤Ω0𝑎2
𝜈
𝑤,

ˆ𝑝= 𝐵𝑅Ω0
𝑎2𝜈𝑝,
ˆ𝜂= 𝑎2𝑅Ω0
𝜈
𝜂,
𝑑ˆΩ
𝑑ˆ𝑡= ¤Ω0 𝑓(𝑡),
ˆΩ = Ω0𝐹(𝑡).
(2.10)
(‘Unhatted’ variables are therefore dimensionless counterparts of the corresponding hatted
variables.) Here T is the timescale of variation of the forcing so that ¤Ω0 = Ω0/T. The velocity
scale U = 𝑅¤Ω0𝑎2/𝜈is chosen to balance the viscous forces with the Euler force. The pressure
scale is chosen to balance the bending term and the forcing term in the plate equation (2.6).
Note that 𝐹(𝑡) is the dimensionless angular velocity and 𝑓(𝑡) is the dimensionless angular
acceleration so that by definition 𝑓(𝑡) = ¤𝐹(𝑡).
2.4.1. Dimensionless equations
Following the rescaling of equations (2.4)–(2.7), the dimensionless continuity equation (2.4)
reads

where the scale factor ℎcan be expressed as ℎ= 1 + 𝜖𝑟cos 𝜃. The dimensionless Navier–
Stokes equations (2.5) along the e𝑟, e𝜃and e𝑠directions are given, respectively, by:
