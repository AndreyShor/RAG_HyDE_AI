Table 1: External feedback phase lags at oscillator frequencies for given delay intervals. The
delay intervals show where the quantum oscillator on [15N]-ACN is sustained, as extracted from
Fig. 2. Parentheses indicate the initial or end sampling intervals rather than real cutoffs. The phase
lag is derived using 𝜑= 2𝜋𝑓𝜏at around the 𝐽-transition frequencies 𝑓=𝐽or 𝑓=2𝐽(𝐽=1.687 Hz),
accounting for frequency-dependent phase lags due to delay. For the negative external feedback
gain (𝐺ext = −20 ), an additional 𝜋phase lag is added.
