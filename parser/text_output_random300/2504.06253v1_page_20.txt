Depth 0 Data
Given a warmstart and a corresponding |𝜓init⟩, at depth 0 we have (for 𝐻, 𝐸min, 𝐸max),
𝛼= ⟨𝜓init|𝐻|𝜓init⟩−𝐸min
𝐸max −𝐸min
P =
∑︁
|𝜙⟩
|⟨𝜙|𝜓init⟩|2
where
⟨𝜙|𝐻|𝜙⟩= 𝐸max.

Because 𝛼for the optimal depth-𝑝parameters can only increase with 𝑝, depth-0 results are a useful heuristic
for estimating the relative performance of warmstart techniques [6]. In particular, we are interested in how the
choice of vertex-at-top rotation qubit affects the obtained (𝛼, P). A natural assumption would be that there are 3
unique distributions (𝛼, P) dependent on the choice of vertex-at-top rotation:
(1) vertex-at-top rotation on any of the qubits except the last qubit,
(2) vertex-at-top rotation on the last qubit,
(3) and no vertex-at-top rotation.
Figure 5 contains a datatable with the frequency at which each choice of vertex at top rotation maximizes either
𝛼or P. Outliers are indicated, and notably only appear in the data for vertex-at-top rotations applied to the last
qubit or when no vertex-at-top rotation is applied.
Based on this assumption, it is sufficient to study 3 vertex-at-top rotation choices, with each each corresponding
to one of these 3 distributions. As in Section 4.1.4, we consider vertex-at-top rotations on the First, Last, and
None of the qubits.
Figure 6 contains a datatable with the mean and standard deviation for 𝛼, P for each warmstart with each
of these vertex-at-top rotation options.

𝛼Distributions
The instance-specific approximation ratio (𝛼) is a convenient metric because it is normalized to [0, 1] for all
problems. However, the distribution of 𝛼over states is problem dependent.
More formally, we want to consider the continuous random variable 𝜶∼𝑃(𝛼) given by
𝜶=
𝑋𝑇A𝑋−min𝑥∈{−1,1}𝑛𝑥𝑇A𝑥
max𝑥∈{−1,1}𝑛𝑥𝑇A𝑥−min𝑥∈{−1,1}𝑛𝑥𝑇A𝑥,
(41)
where (for a given problem type) A is a random matrix sampled by obtaining the adjacency matrix of the
corresponding graph of a randomly generated problem instance, and 𝑋is a random element of {−1, 1}𝑛with
uniform distribution.
To quantify the dependence of the distribution on problem type, we estimated the probability distribution
𝑃(𝛼) for each problem (Figure 4). For each problem instance, 𝛼was computed for each of the 217 computational
basis states, yielding a total of 1000·217 samples for each problem type. The unit interval was then divided into 101
uniformly spaced sub-intervals. The probability density of 𝛼was approximated to be piecewise constant on each
of these sub-intervals, with value equal to the number of 𝛼samples in the interval divided by the 1000/101 · 217
(the product of the width of the subinterval-intervals with the total number of samples).
The most notable feature of these distributions (besides their problem dependence) is that the distribution for
the Random QUBOs is symmetric, whereas the distributions for TSP, Portfolio Optimization, and MIS are skewed
