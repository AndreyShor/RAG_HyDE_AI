ing/benchmarking, as was done for PDF4LHC21 (and before that PDF4LHC15). It may be
necessary to include a fraction of the differences observed between NNLO and aN3LO PDFs as
an additional source of uncertainty. The impact of NLL small-x resummation corrections on the
PDFs, especially those of the gluon, may notably alter the low-x behavior in kinematic regions
where N3LO effects may also be important (and partially orthogonal to those resulting from
low-x resummation). QED effects have been included in global PDF fits for some time, and the
impact can be as large as in going from NNLO to approximate N3LO [29].

Development in amplitude and loop integral techniques
Computing fixed-order amplitudes for scattering processes remains a key obstacle to producing
precise predictions for the LHC and HL-LHC. For ease of presentation, we divide the computa-
tion of multi-loop amplitudes into two broad categories:
1. Obtaining the amplitudes and simplifying (reducing) them,
2. Calculating the integrals which appear in the amplitudes.
In the previous wishlist [1], to which we refer the interested reader, we described the state of
the art of each of these categories in some detail. Here we only briefly highlight a selection of
the most interesting recent advances in this area since the last wishlist. Thorough reviews of
formal developments in the calculation of scattering amplitudes can be found in Ref. [30]. A
modern introduction to techniques for computing multi-loop Feynman integrals can be found
in Ref. [31]. Further details on recent developments can be found in the SAGEX review [32,33]
and Snowmass White Paper [34].
The use of integration-by-parts (IBP) identities [35–37], Lorenz invariance (LI) [38], and
dimension shift relations [39, 40] remains a critically important technique in modern loop cal-
culations, but also presents a major bottleneck. Several efficient codes exist to facilitate their
use, including: Air [41], Fire [42–45] (recently updated in Ref. [46]), LiteRed [47, 48], Re-
duze [49, 50], and Kira [51–53]. The Blade reduction package [54] aims to reduce the total
time to obtain a reduction by generating block-triangular IBP systems, which can be orders
of magnitude smaller than traditional tools. The NeatIBP tool [55] uses syzygy and module
intersection techniques to provide IBP systems in which the propagator degrees are limited. The
use of finite field techniques, as implemented in FireFly [56,57], FiniteFlow [58] and various
private codes [59], has widely been adopted to accelerate the reduction to master integrals. The
RatRacer package [60] can be used to further speed up the use of finite fields by separating the
