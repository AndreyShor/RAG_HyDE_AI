Therefore, we attempt to simulate the four economic modes using novel network 
models that express social relationships and compare their primitive properties. 
 Numerous studies have analyzed economies using network models. For 
example, one study used a directed graph network model to explain the mechanisms 
and inequality of gift economy [18]; another used an exponential random graph model 
to analyze self-organization and similarity in interregional economic development 
competition [19]; one other used an exponential random graph model to analyze 
reciprocity in the interbank market [20]; and yet another used an exponential random 
graph model to analyze structural, economic, geographical, political, and cultural 
factors in global trade networks [21]. However, none of the previous studies have 
compared the properties of the four-mode economic models simultaneously. 
 Representative network models include, for example, the simple random 
graph model (a graph in which edges are generated randomly), the Erdős–Rényi model 
(a random graph in which the probability of edge generation follows a binomial 
distribution) [22], the exponential random graph model (a statistical model with 
exponential parameters for analyzing network data) [23], the stochastic block model (a 
random graph in which nodes are divided into communities and the probability of edge 
generation differs between inside and outside the communities) [24], Watts–Strogatz 
model (another random graph in which a regular graph is generated and its edges are 
rewired based on a predetermined probability) [25], Barabási–Albert model (one other 
random graph in which nodes of a predetermined degree are added at each step and the 
edges are connected with a probability proportional to the degree of the existing nodes) 
[26]. The Watts–Strogatz model exhibits a small-world property, whereas the Barabási–
Albert model exhibits a scale-free property.
