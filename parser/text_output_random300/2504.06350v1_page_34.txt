observable for Bob’s measurement) where ρ0 = |0⟩⟨0| and ρ1 = |1⟩⟨1| are the reduced states for Bob
conditioned upon λ. Inserting in (88), one gets the value S1 = 2, which gives a violation of (87) while
A1 is fully classical. This shows that the form of non-classicality defined as (88) is weaker than QSR 15.
Lobo, Pauwels, and Pironoio showed that there exist stronger versions of tradeoffs between long path
(LP) and short path (SP) correlations in which instead of CHSH, they considered the following Bell
expression for LP [248]
Jθ

where cθ = cos θ (θ ∈[0, π

The intuition of finding the bound (92) is that when Alice and Bob observe S0 = 2

2, by self-testing
the LP correlators are associated with the Pauli expectations i.e. Tr(PAx1) where P ∈{I, σx, σz}, of the
observables Ax1 and as a result, performing tomography of these observables is restricted to ZX plane.
In the case θ = 0 it was found that 1
2[Tr(σxA11) + Tr(σzA01)] ≤

2 [249]. Therefore, the bound (92) can
be obtained by the rotation Rθ =

in the ZX plane.
For any value 0 ≤θ < π
4 , the obtained bound (92) is strictly smaller than the local bound means that
the SP CHSH test weakens the condition to witness long-range quantum correlation based on Jθ
1. This
weakening is maximal in the case θ = 0 yielding
J1 = ⟨A1LB0⟩+ ⟨A0LB1⟩≤2,
(93)
which coincides with the quantum bound in (91). Although the above inequality in the standard case
(without any relay R) does not demonstrate a violation and may not appear to be a proper Bell inequality,
in a routed Bell scenario equipped with a strategy that achieves S0 = 2
√
2, the local bound is replaced
by the SRQ bound (92).
J1 = ⟨A1LB0⟩+ ⟨A0LB1⟩

which is smaller than the quantum bound, making it a proper witness for long-range nonlocality (J1 =

). Therefore, since the SP CHSH is maximally violated, long-range quantum correlations can be
witnessed whenever Jθ

The maximal SP CHSH violation S0 is too strong and unrealistic in experimental settings, so deriving
bounds based on non-maximal cases is important. For the case θ = 0 the following analytical tradeoff
between J1 and S0 can be proved [248]

For other values of θ, an SRQ bound of Jθ

Universal bounds on critical detection efficiency. Similar to the case of the regular Bell experiment, lower
bounds on critical detection efficiency can be obtained in routed Bell scenarios. The detection efficiencies
in a routed Bell experiment can be denoted by the vector ⃗η = (ηA0, ηA1, ηB). It was proved in [248] that
there exists an SRQ model if the following condition is satisfied
ηA1 ≤
ηB(mB −1)
ηB(mA1mB −1) −(mA1 −1),
(96)
which is independent of the number of measurement settings mA0. For the special case mA0 = 0, this
bound can be applied to the standard Bell experiment. Therefore, this bound places fundamental limits on
