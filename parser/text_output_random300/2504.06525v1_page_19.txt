 
Figure S3. Full Pareto scatter plot for the MOBO of droplet sample in Figure 4 and predicted 
distribution of the three rewards at the final step of MOBO. 
 
 
Figure S4. Testing of MOBO on more samples | a-b, height and phase maps taken with optimal 
parameters given by MOBO for water droplet sample. Similar plots are shown for c-d Cs3Bi2I9 
(CBI) microcrystals with a deep hole, e-f flat surface on CBI microcrystals, and g-h a grain 
boundary on CBI microcrystals. There are 10 initial random seeding points and 50 explorative 
active learning steps in this experiment, and the acquisition function of q-Noisy Expected 
Hypervolume Improvement (qNEHI) is used to determine the next parameters to try at each step. 
A fresh Tap300Al-G is used to optimize scan at 1 Hz.
