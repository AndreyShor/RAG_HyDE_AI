In the Fourier domain, the dynamical equation (3.13) becomes
B′′
k + 4πσaB′
k + k2Bk = Sb,⃗k(τ) ,
(3.18)
with the source term being

(3.19)
The scalar ﬁeld φ can be decomposed into a homogeneous background ¯φ(t) and a
perturbative part δφ(⃗x, t):
φ(⃗x, t) = ¯φ(t) + δφ(⃗x, t) ,
(3.20)
with
δφ(⃗x, t) =

where the creation and annihilation operators satisfy
[ˆa⃗k1, ˆa†
⃗k2] = (2π)3δ(3)(⃗k1 −⃗k2) .

The source term in the operator form becomes

(3.23)
and the particular solution to the conformal magnetic ﬁeld is
⃗Bk(τ) =

gk(τ; ˜τ)⃗Sb,⃗k(˜τ)d˜τ ,
(3.24)
where gk is the Green’s function associated to (3.18). As we will show later, the fractional
terms is much more important than the k2 term, since the typical scale for inter-galaxy
magnetic ﬁeld is
kG/atoday = 1Mpc−1 = 6.4 × 10−39GeV .
(3.25)
The dynamical equation then simpliﬁes to
B′′
k + 4πσaB′
k = Sb,⃗k(τ) .

Before annihilation
Before the annihilation event, the electric conductivity is decided by (3.4). Since T scales
as a−1 in the RD epoch, we deﬁne a new quantity
γ ≡2πσa =
2π
α2 ln(1/α)(aT)RD ,
(3.27)
which is constant in the RD epoch. Speciﬁcally, the value of aT can be evaluated at the
radiation-matter equality epoch
(aT)RD = aeqTeq = atoday
zeq + 1 × 1eV ≃3.0 × 10−13GeV ,
