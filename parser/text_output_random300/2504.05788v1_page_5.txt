2.3. Applying boundary conditions and reducing
FV-NEGF to the transport domain
Fig. 2 shows a schematic picture of a nanowire where
we use it as an instrumental tool to illustrate the
implementation of different boundary conditions. The
south, north, top, and bottom faces must be treated
with the zero Dirichlet boundary condition, while the
west and east faces must be treated with the open
boundary condition. Before reducing [A] to a finite-
sized matrix for the reduced domain, we need to
impose the Dirichlet boundary condition on the non-
open boundary faces.

Figure 2:
Schematics of a 3D domain resembling
a nanowire which is discretized into nonuniform
rectangular control volumes.
Outermost cells on
western and eastern faces must be subjected to the
open boundary condition while the Dirichlet boundary
condition must be imposed to the rest of outermost
cells indicated by red dots.
The zero Dirichlet boundary condition is applied
to Eq. (12) in two steps: (I) by eliminating any term
in the set {aS, aN, aB, aT } relevant to the faces with
Dirichlet boundary condition, from the off-diagonal,
(II) by modifying the same term within the diagonal
term (aP ) by aS,N = Γs,n/(δy+,−
s,n ∆Y ) and aB,T =
Γb,t/(δz+,−
b,t ∆Z). Here, the values for Γ∗at Dirichlet
boundaries (Γs,n,b,t ) are known, and therefore there
is no need to evaluate them by the harmonic mean.
Details regarding the implementation of Dirichlet
boundary condition can be found in Ref. [38]. Thus,
handling the closed boundary condition essentially
reduces to correcting the six vectors of a-coefficients.
We stress that the above equation is still for the
semi-infinite domain.
To handle the open boundary
conditions on the western and eastern faces, the total
domain should be partitioned into semi-infinite left
and right contacts, along with the reduced transport
domain (i.e., the channel). Then the infinite matrix
equation [A][G] = [∆V ]−1 can be rewritten as the
following partitioned equation:

Focusing on the central column of G, we can arrive at
three equations for GLC, GC, and GRC. Using matrix
algebra the first and third matrix equations can be
combined into the second equation as

AC −ACLA−1
L ALC −ACRA−1
R ARC

GC =[∆VC]−1.(15)
It is conventional to define the left and right self-
energies as ΣL =ACLA−1
L ALC and ΣR =ACRA−1
R ARC,
respectively, such that above relation can be written as
[AC −ΣL −ΣR][GC][∆VC] = [1].

We refer to A−1
L,R as the contact Green’s function.
Note that ∆VL and ∆VR did not appear in Eq. (16).
Computing

is
intractable as the contact Hamiltonian can be very
large.
We can further divide the transport domain into
a set of supercells, marked by integers in Fig. 2. Here,
a supercell is defined as the collection of all control
volumes sharing the same x-coordinate, xP .
In the
same way, we can divide the contact domains into a
set of supercells, although they are not shown in Fig.
2.
This extra division allows us to make full use of
the concept of the contact surface Green’s function,
gL,R, in evaluating ΣL,R.
Surface Green’s function
essentially imply that one only needs a few blocks of the
contact Green’s functions to evaluate the self-energy
matrices.
Then, the equation for the non-vanishing
blocks of the self-energies can be expressed as: [ΣL]11 =
A1,0 gL A0,1, and [ΣR]NN =AN,N+1 gR AN+1,N. Here,
A01 [AN+1,N] represents the coupling Hamiltonian
between the last [first] supercell of the left [right]
contact and the first [last] supercell of the channel.
The supercell arrangement for FV-NEGF has two other
major advantages as: (I) it allows the implementation
of the Sancho-Rubio method [42] to speed up the
evaluation of gL and gR, (II) it enables employing
the direct recursive algorithm [43, 44], which should
be implemented to make full 3D quantum transport
simulations computationally practical.
If we define
[GC] = [GC][∆VC], the final matrix form of the
retarded Green’s function becomes identical to the
conventional FD-NEGF or TB-NEGF formulation.
While this may appear trivial, the construction of
[AC −ΣL−ΣR] by the FV method is non-trivial due to
the enforcement of conservation laws at all local mesh
interfaces. The remainder of the quantum transport
theory—including the evaluation of observables such
as the transmission function (terminal current) and
local density of states (charge distribution) in terms
of the retarded GR, advanced GA, and lesser (G<)
Green’s functions—remains unchanged. We therefore
omit further theoretical details here, as they can be
found elsewhere [45].
