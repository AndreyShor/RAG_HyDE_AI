3.1.11
t¯tH
LH21 status: NLOQCD corrections for on-shell t¯tH production known [656–659]. NLOEW correc-
tions studied within the Madgraph5_aMC@NLO framework [660,661]. Combined NLOQCD
and NLOEW corrections with NWA top-quark decays computed in Ref. [662]. Corrections to t¯tH
including top quark decays and full off-shell effects computed at NLOQCD [663], and combined
with NLOEW [664]. NLOQCD results merged to parton showers [665, 666] and NLO + NNLL
resummation performed in Refs. [667–670]. The NLOQCD corrections including off-shell effects
were also presented in Ref. [671], further considering the LO decays of the Higgs boson in the
NWA. NLOQCD results in the SMEFT calculated [672]. The flavor off-diagonal channels were
computed at NNLOQCD in Ref. [673]. Fragmentation and splitting functions for the final-state
transitions t →H and g →H, are known at O(y2
t αs) [674].
The NNLOQCD calculation of Ref. [673] has been extended to encompass all partonic
channels for the inclusive cross section [219] and differential distributions [220], using a soft-Higgs
approximation for the as-yet unknown two-loop amplitudes. The NNLOQCD effects increase the
inclusive cross section by around 4%, and leave a residual perturbative uncertainty of 4% for
the cross section and around 4% −6% for the Higgs transverse momentum spectrum.
There have been initial steps towards the evaluation of the two-loop amplitudes. These
were computed in Ref. [675] in the boosted limit in which all quarks are massless. The master
amplitudes for the leading-colour two loop amplitudes have been computed in Ref. [676], the
one-loop gg →t¯tH amplitude was computed to O(ϵ2) in Ref. [677], and the nf-dependent part
of the two-loop amplitude was computed in Ref. [678].
Results for an admixture of CP-even and CP-odd Higgs states have been computed to
NLOQCD, including offshell effects of the top decay [679].
The cross section for t¯tH has been measured with a data sample of 139 fb−1, with a total
uncertainty on the order of 20%, dominated by the statistical error [680,681]. The statistical error
will shrink to the order of 4–5% for 3000 fb−1, leaving a systematics-dominated measurement.
Given that this calculation is currently known only at NLOQCD, with a corresponding scale
uncertainty of the order of 10–15%, this warrants a calculation of the process to NNLOQCD.
3.1.12
tH
LH19 status: NLOQCD corrections known [682,683]. NLOQCD and NLOEW corrections known
for on-shell top quarks, computed in both the four- and five-flavour schemes [684].
3.1.13
b¯bH (including H production in bottom quark fusion treated in 5FS)
LH21 status: NNLOQCD predictions for b¯b →H in the 5FS known for a long time, inclu-
sively [685] and later differentially [686, 687]; resummed calculation at NNLO + NNLL avail-
able [688].
N3LOQCD in threshold approximation [689, 690] calculated; complete inclusive
N3LOQCD corrections to b¯b →H in the 5FS presented in Ref. [691] and matched to the 4FS
in Ref. [692]. Threshold resummations up N3LL were combined with the N3LO results for the
inclusive cross section in Ref. [693]. Massless 4-loop QCD corrections presented in Ref. [694].
N(1,1)LOQCD⊗QED as well as NNLOQED predictions were derived in Ref. [695]. NLOQCD cor-
rections to b¯bH production in the 4FS known since long ago [696,697]; NLOQCD (including the
formally NNLOHTL y2
t contributions) using the 4FS presented in Ref. [698]. NLOQCD matched
to parton shower and compared to 5FS in Ref. [699]; various methods proposed to combine 4FS
