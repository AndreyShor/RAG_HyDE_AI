CONCLUSION
In this paper, three-meson τ decays with the participation of η/η′ mesons in the ﬁnal state have been consid-
ered within the extended NJL model. The amplitudes for the contact channels and channels with intermediate
vector, axial-vector and pseudoscalar mesons in the ground and ﬁrst radially excited states were calculated. The
results are obtained with the phase angle between the ground and ﬁrst radially excited meson states. In the case
of the τ →ππηντ process, the angle value φ = 180◦leads to a result that does not correspond to the PDG
data but is consistent with the recent results of the BaBar and CMD-3 collaborations [19, 20]. Calculation of
the process τ →ππη′ντ with a given value of the angle leads to exceeding the threshold given in the PDG.
However, there is reason to believe that further experimental study of this process may lead to a correction of
this threshold, since analysis of the latest BaBar and CMD-3 data provides branching fractions somewhat larger
than the average value given in PDG.
The decays τ →ππηντ and τ →ππη′ντ occur only through vector channels. These decays were previously
described in the NJL model in the paper [29]. However, the decay width can be calculated based on the e+e−
annihilation process using the phase volume transformation. Similar calculations of the decays τ →ππη(η′)ντ
within the vector current conservation hypothesis (CVC) were performed in the paper [22] where the decay
widths were estimated as Br(τ →ππηντ) = (1.53 ± 0.18)× 10−3 and Br(τ →ππη′ντ) < 3.2 × 10−5.
The τ →ππηντ process was considered in the theoretical work [30] within the chiral perturbation theory
with resonances. However, the calculations were performed without taking into account the contribution of the
intermediate radially excited ρ(1450) meson. The spectral function for the invariant mass Mππη was ﬁtted by
model parameters based on Belle data [31]. At the same time, the calculations in the present work in the NJL
model show that the contribution from the intermediate ρ(1450) meson is important for describing the decay
widths.
In the paper [30] the τ →ππη′ντ decay was also considered. However, the theoretical estimate for the partial
width of this decay is in the range Br(τ →ππη′ντ) = (1−4.5)×10−4 and exceeds the experimental threshold.
It is important to note that the estimates for the τ →ππη′ντ decay obtained using the CVC hypothesis and
within the NJL model exceed the experimental limit for the decay width. All this may indicate the need for a
more thorough experimental and theoretical study of this process.
The results of calculations in the NJL model for the decays τ →πηη(η′)ντ are given in the chapter IV. In
contrast to the above processes, the matrix elements of these decays are determined by the axial current. The
calculations show that the main contribution to the decay width of τ →πηηντ is given by the axial-vector
channels with the intermediate states a1(1260) and a1(1640) containing the scalar meson a0(980). Note that
among the numerous τ decays, the decay τ →πηηντ is unique where the scalar isovector meson a0 plays a
dominant role in determining the decay width.
In a recent paper [32], a theoretical estimation of the contribution of the intermediate scalar meson f0(500) to
the total decay width τ →π−π0π0ντ was given. It was shown that the contribution of the intermediate channel
f0(500)π is 13% of the total decay width, which is consistent with the CLOE II data (16.18 ± 3.85) % [33].
Moreover, taking into account the scalar channel in this decay turns out to be important for a correct description
of the invariant mass distribution function of three pions . All this demonstrates the importance of taking into
account channels with intermediate scalar mesons for a number of three-meson τ decays.
