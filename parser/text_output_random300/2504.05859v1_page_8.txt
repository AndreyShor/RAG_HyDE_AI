the convolution of the electronic thermalization (e.g., via exciton-electron scatterings) 
that generate hot electrons and the hot-electron tunneling from MoSe2 to WS2. Here, 
we attribute the rise dynamics of 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 to the electronic thermalization in MoSe2, as a 
result of faster hot-electron tunneling (<1 ps, see more discussion later); the decay 
dynamics of 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 is attributed to the electron back-transfer from WS2 to MoSe2, driven 
by the conduction band offset, which is consistent with another ultrafast study of hBN-
separated TMD heterostructures25. The magnitude of ∆𝑇𝑇∗ is also in line with previous 
reports26,27.  
With the two-profile analysis, we explore hot-electron extraction dynamics with 
varying electron doping in MoSe2, as shown in Figure 3a. The maxima of 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 
dynamics, denoted as 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸,𝑚𝑚, are shown in Figure 3b. Upon MoSe2 electron doped, 
𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸,𝑚𝑚 gets vastly enhanced by a factor up to ~30, with an onset behavior. Moreover, 
the rise dynamics also shows an onset behavior, which suddenly slows down at low 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 
and then becomes faster with further increasing 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 (Figure 3c). The largest 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸,𝑚𝑚 
corresponds to the hot-electron extraction efficiency about 5%, defined as 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸,𝑚𝑚/𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒, 
where 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 is the initial photoexcited hot exciton density in MoSe2. The corresponding 
∆𝑇𝑇∗ dynamics is shown in Figure S9. 
To gain more insights about doping-enhanced hot-electron extraction, we study 
ultrafast dynamics of AM resonance of MoSe2 with varying electron doping in MoSe2. 
Surprisingly, the rise timescale (empty circles) of AM resonance shows onset doping
