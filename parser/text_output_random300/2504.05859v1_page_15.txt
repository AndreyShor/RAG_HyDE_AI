Figure 3. Enhanced hot-electron extraction upon electron doping MoSe2. (a) The 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 
dynamics with 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 varying from 0 to 4.6×1012 cm-2 in MoSe2, corresponding to 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷 
varying from 0 V to 6.45 V. The initial 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 is about 2.5×1012 cm-2, corresponding to 
pump fluence about 63 𝜇𝜇J/cm2. 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸 is kept at 0 V. The dynamics is fitted with a two-
exponential function (dashed). (b) The maximum of hot-electron extraction density 
𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸,𝑚𝑚 and the corresponding hot-electron extraction efficiency as a function of 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷. 
The vertical gray line indicates the initial of electron doping. (c) The doping-dependent 
rise time constant of 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 as a function of 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷, compared with the rise time constant of 
AM resonance (Figure S10). (d-f) The schematic of hot-electron extraction mechanism 
for neutral and doped MoSe2. The scatterings between hot excitons and doped electrons 
(e,f) can generate hot electrons more efficiently than the scatterings among excitons (d).
