Figure 5: Process of crack localization using XRF and microscopy: (a) Schematic of the XRF
process, (b) XRF image, (c) Optical microscope image, (d) Registered XRF and microscopy images,
(e) Crack segmentation.
Figure 6: Peak width maps with crack overlay and their corresponding 2D histograms of peak
width vs crack distance: (a+d), (b+e), and (c+f). Here, we observe effects of crystal recovery up
to 300 Âµm from the crack for the peaks 211, 310, and 321, respectively.
