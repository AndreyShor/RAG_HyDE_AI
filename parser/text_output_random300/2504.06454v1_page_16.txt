the
bcc-structured
(TiV)0.5Nb0.4Ta0.1 alloy, which exhibits Tc=5.2 K and µ0Hc2(0)=6.4 T[80]. The
magnetic ﬁeld dependence of Jc at 1.8 K has been reported, with the self-ﬁeld Jc
reaching 0.4×105 A/cm2, monotonically decreasing as the magnetic ﬁeld increases.
The dominant ﬂux pinning mechanism in this alloy is surface pinning.
4 (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5
(TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 can be categorized as a Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti Senkov alloy, as dis-
cussed in the previous chapter. However, its Jc dependence on annealing temperature
