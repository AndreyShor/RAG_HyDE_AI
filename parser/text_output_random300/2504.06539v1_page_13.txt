The graviton number is computed using the Heisenberg equation (red solid line) and 1-loop
perturbation theory (blue dashed line) in the Minkowski background.
The initial conditions are set to
n(0) = 1, θ(0) = π, and the parameter xpl is set to 10−41. Top: xβ = 3 × 10−21, i.e., α ∼0.054. The
emission effect is small and remains perturbative. Bottom left: xβ = 1.6 × 10−21, i.e., α ∼0.67. The
deviation between the Heisenberg equation and the 1-loop perturbation theory becomes apparent. Bottom
right: xβ = 1.4 × 10−21, i.e., α ∼1.14, where a resonance effect is observed.
wavenumber of the emitted graviton. For γ > 1, a graviton can be enclosed within the bath. The
time scale ℓis related to the curvature radius, and the physical Hubble parameter is given by
H = 1/(2ℓ). To ensure that the backreaction remains small, we require

This condition can be rewritten as
α ≪

40π2γ2 .

Thus, α must remain at most at the sub-percent level to keep the backreaction to spacetime neg-
ligible. Since α is determined by the graviton wavenumber and the thermal bath temperature, the
stimulated emission effect remains well within the perturbative regime as long as the backreaction
is insignificant.
Before closing this section, we offer several comments on the equations of motion we obtained.
Firstly, it turns out that λ = 0 is a valid solution to the differential equations in the flat background,
that corresponding to the expectation value of Lk in any particle number eigenstates. Thus, one can
safely assume that graviton mixed states can be expanded in terms of the Hamiltonian eigenstates.
With this initial condition, stimulated emission does not occur. In other words, assuming the gravi-
ton is initially in a mixed state that can be expanded in terms of the particle number eigenstates,
