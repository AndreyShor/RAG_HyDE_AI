the interlayer distance and δx0 the relative shift along
the x-axis, the armchair direction. The cases δx0 = 0
and δx0 = a0 correspond to the A-A and A-B patterns,
respectively. Further increasing δx0 will result in a cyclic
evolution A-A→A-B→M →B-A→A-A with a period
3a0, where the M pattern corresponds to the middle point
δx0 = 3a0/2. Therefore, it is suﬃcient to consider the
sliding distance 0 ≤δx0 ≤3a0/2. The inversion sym-
metry ( the simultaneous exchange between the odd and
even sublattices) is preserved in the A-A and M patterns
only.

Hence, it is legitimate to consider the ma-
jor elements coming from the intra-cell and the nearby

tions, denoted by V (∆1,∆2)

This approximation corresponds to

Without losing the generality, We
calculate the band structure landscape with various δx0
by simply assuming Vij = V

as a planar-distance cut-oﬀ(see more explicit numerical
scheme in Appendix A).
In order to elucidate the essential features of the KS
phases, we will then isolate the ideal situation with a
single hybridization parameter, i.e., the strongest inter-
layer hybridization. This parameter can be identiﬁed as
the nearest-neighbor hybridization V1 = V⟨ij⟩(= V ) in
the A-A and A-B patterns (V (0,0)
ηη
and V (0,0)
AB ), respec-
tively. It plays the most crucial role in the formation of
the SKS. To investigate the stability of this phase, we
will further include the next-nearest-neighbor hybridiza-
tion V2 = V⟨⟨ij⟩⟩= αV as a perturbation, with α being
an additional tuning parameter.
The Hamiltonian at the limit δx0 = 0, the A-A pat-
tern, was previously studied (in the case tf = 0 and
V2 = 0) by using various methods, including the slave-
boson technique [49, 50]. In this situation, the hybridiza-
tion matrix respects the inversion symmetry.
With ﬁ-
nite V1(= V ), the two c bands start to hybridize the
doubly degenerated local f orbital, resulting in the four
Bloch bands provided V1 is larger than a critical value
Vc, above which the KS occurs. As explicitly shown in
the Appendices B and C, Vc slowly decreases by turning
on V2, without essential change in the band structure.
The Dirac semimetal feature is reﬂected by a pair of hy-
bridised Dirac-like conduction and valence bands that are
symmetrically separated by the Kondo gap. So, the sys-
tem is in the KI phase at half-ﬁlling.
The present study focuses on the sliding process (for
0 < δx0 ≤3a0/2) and pays special attention to the point
δx0 = a0, corresponding to the A-B pattern. This situa-
tion is fairly non-trivial since the C3 symmetry is restored
although the inversion symmetry is lost due to interlayer
hybridization. The previous band structure result must
be altered and the existence of the Kondo phase is in
question.

METHOD
In order to clarify the possible Kondo phase in the
present problem, we consider the limit U →∞and solve
the model by using the slave boson mean-ﬁeld method
[51, 52]. The f electron operator is then represented by
a fermionic operator ˆdjσ and a bosonic operator ˆbj such
that ˆf †
⃗Rjσ = ˆd†
jσˆbj. The large U limit imposes the no-
double occupation constraint ˆb†
jˆbj+P
σ ˆd†
jσ ˆdjσ = 1 at each
lattice sites. The hybridization matrix induces the eﬀec-
tive Kondo coupling ˜Vij = ⟨ˆbj⟩Vij, where ⟨ˆbj⟩is the expec-
tation value of the slave boson on a given state j = (n, η)
and can be always treated as real.
The constraint is
implemented by introducing a Lagrange multiplier λj in
the path integral approach (see Appendix D). In this ap-
proach, the annihilation or creation operators are rep-
resented by the respective ﬁeld variables, (cjσ, djσ, bj) or
(¯cjσ, ¯djσ, b∗
j ), with the implied temperature-dependence.
The Hamiltonian operator is represented by the classical
Hamiltonian of the same form.
Due to the inversion symmetry breaking, the expecta-
tion value ⟨ˆbj⟩on the groundstate is η-dependent, while
it is uniform in n due to the lattice translational invari-
ance.
Therefore, we can introduce two real order pa-
rameters, rη = ⟨ˆbn,η⟩, for each sublattices η = A, B.
The solution with rη > 0 implies the occurrence of KS
in η-sublattice.
Then the substitution bη →rη could
be invoked in the mean ﬁeld approach.
Similarly, the
Lagrange ﬁeld is also η-dependent, thus represented by
λη accordingly. All these mean ﬁeld parameters (rη, λη)
should be determined self-consistently.
With the above considerations, the eﬀective mean-ﬁeld
Hamiltonian is expressed in the momentum space as
HMF =
X
kσ
¯ΨkσHkσΨkσ + EC
(5)
with Ψkσ = (cAkσ, cBkσ, dAkσ, dBkσ)T being the corre-
sponding Fourier transformed ﬁelds and the momentum
k being valued in the hexagonal Brillouin zone (BZ).
Here, EC = L P
