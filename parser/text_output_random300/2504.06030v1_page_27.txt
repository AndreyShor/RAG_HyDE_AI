For purposes of comparison we include the general classical solution here. The details
and more powerful results with complete proofs can be found in Ref. [27].
Firstly one has to ascertain the value of E < 0 to decide if there is one or two potential
wells as explained above for this value of the energy. Once one has found the roots of
the cubic f ′(u) = 0 and our corresponding effective potential Veff, u = 1
r, this is a simple
task. Then, if the well in question is u ∈(u0, u1) for u0, u1 roots of f(u) = 0, we define
the well-time z by
z =

We consider WIMP clouds with large angular momentum in a fixed direction so motion
is confined to the z = 0 plane and a small neighbourhood. In studying the formation of
