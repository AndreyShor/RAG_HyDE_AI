Definition 9. (Stability View of a Vector Field-Based Dynamical Sys-
tem).
A characteristic of an object (aka sets, systems) X is a mapping φ:
φ : X →C defined by φ(x ∈X) ∈C.
Definition 10. (Characteristic Nearness of Systems [9]).
Let X, Y be a pair of systems. For nonempty subsets A ∈2X, B ∈2Y , the charac-
teristic nearness of A, B (denoted by A eδΦ B) is defined by
A eδΦ B ⇔d
eΦ(A, B) = ε ∈[0, 1].

Theorem 2. (Fundamental Theorem of Near Systems).
Let X, Y be a pair of systems with A ∈2X, B ∈2Y .
A eδΦ B ⇔∃a ∈A, b ∈B : |φ(a) −φ(b)| = ε ∈[0, 1].
Proof.
⇒: From Def. 8, A eδΦ B implies that there is at least one pair a ∈A, b ∈B
such that dΦ(A, B) = |φ(a) −φ(b)| = ε ∈[0, 1].
⇐: Given dΦ(A, B) = ε ∈[0, 1], we know that infa∈A
b∈B |φ(a) −φ(b)| = ε ∈
[0, 1] ∈C. Hence, from Def. 10, A eδΦ B, also. That is, sufficient nearness of
at least one pair characteristics φ(a ∈A), φ(b ∈B) ∈[0, 1] ∈C indicates the
characteristic nearness of the sets, i.e., we conclude A eδΦ B.

Theorem 3. (Characteristically Close Systems).
Systems X, Y are characteristically near if and only X, Y contain subsystems
that are characteristically near.
Proof. Immediate from Theorem 2.

Theorem 4. (Stable Systems Extreme Closeness Condition).
Let ⃗V f1, ⃗V f2 be vector fields representing a pair of stable systems and let
maxλvecV f1, maxλvecV f2 be the maximum λ (eigenvalues) for the pair of sys-
tems. If
maxλ⃗V f1 −maxλ⃗V f2
 ∈[0, 0.5] , then ⃗V f1 eδΦ ⃗V f2.
Proof. From Theorem 1, for the vector field ⃗V f for a stable system,
maxλvecV f ∈[0, ±1] .
For a pair of system vector fields ⃗V f1, ⃗V f2, assume that
maxλ⃗V f1 −maxλ⃗V f2
 ∈[0, 0.5] ∈[0, 1]
Hence, from Theorem 2, we have ⃗V f1 eδΦ ⃗V f2.

Remark 3. (Magiros Stable System Motions Condition).
Let the extreme closeness stability condition Theorem 4 corresponds to a pair of
vector fields
⃗V f1, ⃗V f1 : ⃗V f1 eδΦ ⃗V f1
derived from motion waveforms of a pair
