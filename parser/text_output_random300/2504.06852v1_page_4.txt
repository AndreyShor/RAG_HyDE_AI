photoconductivity is related to the optical frequency, the
relaxation time, and the reciprocal space structure of the
material.

Formally, Eq.
18 is very
similar to the Hall conductivity of electrons, which is
quantized because of the topological property of the
system6. However, because of the Bosen distribution of
magnons, the topological property of magnon system can
not lead to the quantization of magnon spin photocon-
ductivity. But the topological property is still beneficial
for us to control the MSPC. We will discuss this problem
in Sec. IV.
In addition, different from the Hall effect of electron,
according to Eq. 3, the ωi can not be zero, otherwise the
perturbation term is zero. So the effect of the topological
property on MSPC is approximate.

MEPC
Similar to the discussion of MSPC, the MEPC in-
duced by time-dependent electric field is jE(1)
=
P
mn ρ(1)
nm(k, t)vE
mn(k). And MEPC can be expressed as
jE(1) = jE(1)

Therefore, jE(1)

also decreases exponentially with time.
When the relaxation time τ is short enough (Γ >> ωgap)
or the time evolution is long enough, we can ignore the
damping part jE(1)

So we also omit the subscripts
O and D. When Γ →0 and ω << ωgap, the magnon
energy photoconductivity can be expressed as (detail see
Appendix E 2)

(22)
Different from the magnon spin photoconductivity, the
magnon energy photoconductivity can not be written as
the form related to Berry curvature. So it is difficult to
discuss the controlling of MEPC through the topological
property directly.

Phenomenological representation of magnon
photo-transport
Then we consider the monochromatic light. For the
magnon spin photoconductivity and magnon energy pho-
toconductivity, we can define χ(E)

ab (ω) +

Here, E0,b is the amplitude of electric field, ω is the op-
tical frequency, and ϕb is the initial phase of the direc-
tion of b, in which b is the direction of Cartesian coor-
dinates (detail see Appendix B). And what we’re talk-
ing about here is a phenomenological representation of
magnon transport, where the (E) in superscript means
that we’re thinking about either MSPC or MEPC. Here,
we assume that ϕx = 0 and ϕy −ϕx = ϕy = δ, so the
