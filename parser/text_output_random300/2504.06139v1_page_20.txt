The following results by Jones and Masanes [15] show that, to the con-
trary, d-input boxes are very interconvertible.
Theorem 22. PR-boxes are suﬃcient to simulate all non-signalling corre-
lations with binary output (da=db=2).
Theorem 23. All correlations with arbitrary dx and dy, and binary output
(da= db=2) are interconvertible.
We refer the reader to the original paper for both proofs.

Multi-party Correlations
Now consider the case where three participants Alice, Bob and Charlie exhibit
non-local correlations. The deﬁnition of the non-local box can be extended
to accommodate this new model.
Deﬁnition 19. A tripartite correlated box (or box) is a device with three
ends. Each end has the following input-output behaviour: given input x, y
and z, the box will respectively output a, b and c according to some probability
distribution P(abc|xyz) where x, y, z, a, b, c ∈{0, 1}.
The probabilities P(abc|xyz) are subject to positivity and normalization,
and the trivial extension of the non-signalling constraints
X
a
P(abc|xyz) =
X
a
P(abc|x′yz)
∀b, c, x, x′, y, z
X
b
P(abc|xyz) =
X
b
P(abc|xy′z)
∀b, c, x, y, y′, z
X
c
P(abc|xyz) =
X
c
P(abc|xyz′)
∀b, c, x, y, z, z′
While the non-signalling condition is roughly unchanged, non-locality
needs to be deﬁned diﬀerently than with bipartite correlations. Alice, Bob
and Charlie can be pairwise local which each other.
Deﬁnition 20. A box P fully local if it can be written as
P(abc|xyz) =
X
i
λiP A
i (a|x)P B
i (b|y)P C
i (c|z)
where λi ≥0 and P
i λi = 1.
