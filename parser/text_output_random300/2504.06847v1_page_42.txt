Experimental details 
 
Vibrational spectroscopy 
 
FTIR spectra were recorded on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Nicolet Magna 6700 FTIR 
spectrometer (2 cm–1 resolution, Happ-Genzel apodization) in the 400-4000 cm–1 region using 
transmission (nujol and fluorolube mulls, KBr windows) and DRIFTS (samples mixed with 
KBr) techniques. The FAR IR spectra of 2-AmpH2PO3 were recorded down to 60 cm-1 (4 cm-
1 resolution) in the PE pellets.  
 
Micro-FTIR spectra of 2-AmpHSO4 polymorphs were recorded by ATR technique on a 
Thermo Fisher Scientific Nicolet iN10 FTIR microscope using Ge crystal in the 675−4000 cm-
1 region (4 cm-1 resolution, Norton−Beer strong apodization). Standard ATR correction 
(Thermo Nicolet Omnic 9.2 software [S1]) was applied to the recorded spectra.  
 
FT Raman spectra of the powdered samples were recorded on a Thermo Fisher Scientific 
Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with the Nicolet Nexus FT Raman module (2 cm-1 
resolution, Happ-Genzel apodization, 1064 nm Nd:YVO4 laser excitation, 450 mW power at 
the sample) in the 100–3900 cm-1 region. 
 
Raman spectra of microcrystalline samples and aqueous 2-Amp and 2-Amp(1+) solutions 
were collected on a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman Microscope interfaced to an Olympus 
microscope (objectives 4x, 10x and 50x) in the 30–1800 cm−1 spectral region (400 lines/mm 
and 830 lines/mm gratings) using frequency-stabilized 780 nm single mode diode laser 
excitation. The spectrometer was calibrated using a software-controlled calibration procedure 
employing multiple neon emission lines (wavelength calibration), multiple polystyrene Raman 
bands (laser frequency calibration) and standardized white light sources (intensity calibration).  
 
Raman spectra of microcrystalline samples were also collected on a dispersive confocal 
Raman microscope MonoVista CRS+ (Spectroscopy & Imaging GmbH, Germany) interfaced 
to an Olympus microscope (objectives 20x and 50x) using a 785 nm diode excitation laser (10 
mW laser power, 40–3800 cm-1 spectral range, 300 lines/mm grating). The spectrometer was 
wavelength- and intensity-calibrated using a software-controlled auto-alignment and 
calibration procedure with mercury and Ne–Ar lamps. 
 
Quantum Chemical Computations 
 
The quantum chemical computations concerning the 2-Amp(1+) cation were performed 
(Gaussian 09W software [36]) using the closed-shell restricted density functional theory (DFT) 
method using Becke’s three-parameter hybrid functional [S2] combined with the Lee-Yang-
Parr correlation functional (B3LYP) [S3] with the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set, applying tight 
convergence criteria and an ultrafine integration grid. Geometry optimization of the isolated 2-
Amp(1+) cation was followed by vibrational frequency calculations using the same method and 
a basis set. Theoretical Raman intensities of computed normal modes were calculated (RAINT 
programme [37]) for a 1064 nm excitation wavelength, taking Raman scattering activities from 
Gaussian output. The assignment of the computed normal vibrational modes is based on the 
visualization of the atom motions in the GaussView programme [38] and performed PED 
analysis using the VEDA4 programme [39] (described in detail in paper [S4]). 
 
Solid-state DFT computational studies of 2-AmpH2PO3 focused on vibrational spectra and 
optical properties were carried out using the CRYSTAL17 program [42]. Three approaches 
differing in functional and basis sets were selected. The computation named “B3LYP” 
employed the B3LYP functional, the 6-31+G(d,p) basis for all oxygen atoms and the 6-31G(d) 
basis set for all other atoms. For sampling the Brillouin zone, the Pack–Monkhorst net used 8, 
and the Gilat net used 16 points. The numerical integration used the extra-extra-large grid 
(keyword XXLGRID) of the program.
