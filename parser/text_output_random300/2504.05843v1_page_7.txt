This allows us to write one Pfaffian differential equation
∂y e = My . e
(37)
for every outer parameter.
Guessing the most suitable basis is an art. Nonetheless, bilinears of the various denominators do seem
natural and turn out to be very useful, see also [6]. In our off-shell one-loop box example, a near ideal choice
is

where the first form yields the (undifferentiated) box integral (13) up to normalisation. The last three entries
are as in our first level basis (19) although they now carry both differentials. All the masters have simple poles
only in s, t apart from the scaling at infinity, which may be of order 0. In particular, with this basis only the
two leading orders of the expansion around poles are solicited which substantially reduces the computational
load. The decomposition is very quick on a laptop also for the derivatives of the master integrals.

Once again the coordinate dependence factors out!
The matrices Mz, M¯z for the Pfaffian equations are given in the supplemental material as they are somewhat
bulky due to the parameters γ, δ, ρ. We observe that they go into each other under the exchange z ↔¯z and
that they obey the integrability condition
∂zM¯z −∂¯zMz −MzM¯z + M¯zMz = 0 .
(42)
which guarantees that integrating, say, the z equation first and substituting the result into the ¯z condition will
yield a z-independent ordinary differential equation on ¯z.
Next, let us rescale γ →γ ϵ, δ →δ ϵ, ρ →ρ ϵ yielding matrices M ′
z, M ′
¯z. The ϵ dependence of these
rescaled matrices is linear. What is more, their constant part is diagonal:
M ′
z|ϵ →0 = −∂z log diag{z −¯z, 1 −z, z, 1 −z, 1, z, z + ¯z −z¯z}
(43)
and the same with z ↔¯z. These lowest order equations imply [6] that our seven masters have the rational
denominators
d = {z −¯z, (1 −z)(1 −¯z), z¯z, (1 −z)(1 −¯z), 1, z¯z, z + ¯z −z¯z} .
(44)
These are exactly as in (40) implying that the second level intersection matrix becomes coordinate independent
upon rescaling the master integrals accordingly. On the Pfaffian matrices that induces the transformation
M ′
z →Nz = A−1(M ′
zA −∂zA) ,
A = diag(d)−1
(45)
and similarly for the ¯z equation. The matrices Nz, N¯z are homogeneous of degree one in ϵ so that we now
have canonical equations wrt. this parameter. They can be iterated as in [18, 6].
To find the starting values for this process we inspect the singularities of the differential-stripped forms in
(38). Asserting that the values of the coordinates z, ¯z are sufficiently generic the denominators p5, p6 will have
