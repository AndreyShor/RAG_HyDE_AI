It remains to show that (5.15) holds. This bound is already proved in [CCR23], though it
is not stated in this form. For this reason, in the next lines we state the needed results from
[CCR23, Section 4] and we put them together to deduce (5.15). The purpose is to provide a
roadmap for an interested reader to check that (5.15) is a direct consequence of the results
in [CCR23]. We refrain from introducing the notation involved, see [CCR23] for details.
We start from [CCR23, Theorems 4.8 and 4.11]: by equations (4.18)-(4.19) and (4.24)-
(4.25) with λ “ ˆλ{L, the following inequality holds:

The terms in these expressions are defined in [CCR23, Section 4]. In a nutshell, W is a
weight function† and pq|φ|,I
L
, sq|φ|,I
L
denote suitable averages of the boundary conditions φ, ψ
with respect to the random walk kernel, while pQ and pU denote linear operators acting on
functions on pZ2qh. We will next state estimates on each term in (B.6)-(B.7), taken verbatim
from [CCR23], which combined together will lead to (5.15).
We denote by Cˆt, Cˆt, p
Cˆt, q
Cˆt suitable constants. Let us first bound the terms in (B.6):
‚ by [CCR23, Proposition 4.19], equation (4.44) with r “ 1 gives
