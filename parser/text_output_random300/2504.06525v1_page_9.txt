The height difference shows collaborative behavior with the reward of tip-sample distance. In 
contrast, the reward of phase shows competing behavior with the reward of height difference and 
reward of tip-sample distance. d-f, characteristic scan trace and retrace lines of height and phase

Pareto front tests the definition of the reward 
In Figure 4, instead of employing the three rewards introduced in Figures 1 and 2 within the 
MOBO process, a fourth reward is introduced to demonstrate how the Pareto front can be leveraged 
to validate the definition of rewards. In addition to absolute height difference, the Pearson 
correlation between trace and retrace scan lines—referred to as the similarity reward—can be used 
to quantify their alignment. 
The resulting Pareto scatter plot between the height difference reward and the similarity reward 
in Figure 4c highlights that height difference is a more effective metric for quantifying the 
alignment of trace and retrace scan lines. This conclusion is based on two key observations. First, 
the height difference reward exhibits a larger span compared to the similarity reward, allowing it 
to contribute more significantly to hypervolume gain and thus carry greater weight in trade-offs 
with other rewards. In contrast, the similarity reward's narrow range of variation makes it less 
influential in the acquisition function, leading to its underrepresentation in the optimization 
process. Second, the similarity reward is clustered predominantly around a value of –1, despite the 
MOBO process exploring a broad range of scan qualities. In contrast, the height difference reward 
is smoothly distributed across its full range, further demonstrating its superior ability to capture 
variations in trace-retrace alignment. 
A well-defined reward function for scan quality should exhibit both a broad dynamic range, 
ensuring its contribution to hypervolume improvement, and a well-separated, continuous 
distribution, allowing for effective differentiation of scan qualities. The Pareto scatter plot thus 
serves as a valuable tool for evaluating the effectiveness of different reward definitions. 
The Pareto scatter plots of the remaining three rewards (Figure 4d-f) further illustrate trade-
offs in the water droplet system. Notably, the height difference reward shares similar optimal 
parameters with the phase reward, as evidenced by their collective behavior in Figure 4e—where 
height difference can be maximized with minimal compromise in phase reward. This relationship 
is further corroborated by Figure S2c and S2e. Consequently, the tip-sample distance reward is 
sacrificed in the optimization trade-off to maximize overall hypervolume improvement, as 
indicated in Figure 3d.
