FIG. S3.
Equilibrium linking probability of melts of self-assembled rings for 3, 4 and 5 rings.
The
central graph shows the linking probability, Plink, for a canonically-equilibrated ring melt filling a 5 × 5 × 4 cubic
lattice, considering only 3 (blue line), 4 rings (orange line) and 5 rings (green line). The data points represent the
average Plink computed from 4 reconstructions, and the shaded bands indicate the standard error of the mean. The
callouts point to rendered sampled structures with the largest possible curvature (left column), average curvature
(top, center), and minimal curvature (right column). The latter present a parity (even-odd) effect. The sampled
configurations with 3 and 5 rings were free of concatenations. As illustrated, they feature stacked planar rings and a
longer one that threads through them without concatenation, unlike configurations with 4 rings.

FIG. S4.
Average curvature of melts of self-
assembled rings as a function of the reduced
bending rigidity βκb.
Average curvature ⟨nc⟩for a
canonically-equilibrated ring melt filling a 5 × 5 × 4 cu-
bic lattice.
The data points represent ⟨nc⟩computed
from 4 reconstructions, and the shaded bands indicate
the standard error of the mean. The considered range of
βκb spans from −8 to +8, i.e., from strongly favored to
strongly suppressed corner turns.
