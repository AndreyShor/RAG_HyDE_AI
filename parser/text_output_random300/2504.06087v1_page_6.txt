Inset: relative energies of 3 protonation sites vs HC site.
account for larger bond lengths between the iron and
sulfur cores. Relativistic effects are part of the corre-
lation consistent effective core potentials (ccECP) [39]
used throughout this work.
Unlike CCSD(T), FiRE
does not require any corrections and still agrees with
Zhai et al.’s compound estimate within chemical ac-
curacy, with a mean absolute error of only 1.3 mEh,
outperforming CCSD(T)/CBS which has a mean ab-
solute error of 2.4 mEh.
With 180 electrons, this is
not only the largest NN-VMC calculation done so far
but also demonstrates the generality of FiRE even in
cases where CCSD(T)/CBS does not achieve chemical
accuracy.
Overall, we demonstrated that FiRE accurately de-
scribes non-covalent interactions, singlet-triplet gaps,
and ionization potentials on various systems. At this
accuracy, it is unclear whether the remaining errors
are due to errors in references, e.g., CCSD(T) errors,
comparing 0 K gas phase to experimental conditions,
or structural relaxations which may affect relative en-
ergies [33].

Convergence rates for NN-VMC
Our ability to optimize neural wave functions for such
large systems enables us to study the scaling behavior
of NN-VMC for the first time.
When analyzing the
errors in absolute energies for acenes (Sec. 2.2) and cu-
mulenes (App. B), as a function of system size nel and
number of optimization steps t, we find good agreement
with a power law of the form
E(t, nel) −E(∞, nel) ∝t−αnel
β,
(7)
as depicted in Fig. 5. Interestingly, we find similar ex-
ponents of α ≈1 and β ≈2.3 across systems. Some
recent theoretical work on convergence rates of VMC
has also obtained polynomial convergence in the num-
ber of steps, although at lower rates [40, 41]. While
their analysis is not directly applicable to our setting,
we give a short comparison in App. J. Extrapolating
from our empirical rates, to reach a given error in ab-
solute energy, the number of optimization steps needs
to scale as t ∼nel
β
α ≈nel2.3.
