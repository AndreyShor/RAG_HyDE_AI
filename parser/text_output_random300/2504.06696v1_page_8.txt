DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION
Finally, we present some discussions on the experi-
mental implementation of this scheme. In our scheme,
there are four elements: the optomechanical coupling be-
tween the field and the mechanical motion, the Kerr in-
teraction of the cavity field, the designed squeezed vac-
uum bath of the cavity field, and the monochromatic
driving of the cavity field.
To implement the scheme,
the physical system candidate should be able to real-
ize these four elements.
The optomechanical coupling
can now be implemented in many physical systems, in-
cluding optical microresonators [58–60], electromechan-
ical systems [61–64], photonic crystal nanobeams [65–
67], and Fabry-P´erot cavities [68]. The monochromatic
driving for the cavity field is experimentally accessible
in many physical systems. Therefore, the key elements
are the Kerr interaction and the squeezed vacuum bath.
Usually, the Kerr interaction can be induced by coupling
the cavity field to an N-type four-level atomic system.
It has been reported that the Kerr constant can reach
χ/2π ≈0.16 MHz [48]. In addition, we point out that the
Kerr interaction of the cavity field exists in the circuit-
QED system [69] and the Kerr interaction has been re-
alized in cavity magnomechanical systems [70, 71].
In
particular, several experiments have reported the real-
ization of the Kerr interaction [72–74]. For the squeezed
vacuum bath, it can be created by injecting a squeezed
vacuum field into the cavity mode. Based on the above
analyses, our scheme should be within the reach of cur-
rent and near-future experimental conditions.
In conclusion, we have proposed a scheme to enhance
the optomechanical entanglement. This is achieved by
introducing both the Kerr interaction in the cavity field
and the squeezed vacuum bath. Under the strong driving
of the cavity field, the two-photon terms induced by the
Kerr interaction will introduce an effective amplification
into the linearized optomechanical coupling. Meanwhile,
the optical bath will also be amplitied by the two-photon
terms and this amplification effect can be eliminated by
introducing a well designed squeezed vacuum reservoir.
We have analyzed the parameter space and discussed the
stability of the linearized optomechanical system.
We
have also studied the enhanced optomechanical entangle-
ment. It has been found that the optomechanical entan-
glement can be enhanced with the coupling amplification
induced by the Kerr nonlinearity. Our results will moti-
vate the study on enhancing other optomechanical effects
via quantum amplification and reservoir design.

Appendix: Analyses of the stability of the system
In this appendix, we analyze the stability of the driven
Kerr cavity optomechanical system described by the lin-
earized Hamiltonian in Eq. (16). As shown in Eq. (16),
both the effective driving detuning ∆sd and the linearized
optomechanical coupling strength Gsd depend on the
steady-state displacement amplitudes αss and βss, which
are determined by the steady-state equation

In our analyses in the main text, the cubic equation
has three solutions, but we only consider a single real
root and a triple real root, which requires the coefficients
to satisfy the conditions: (i) η > 0; (ii) η = 0 and q = 0.
In this case, the solution of the cubic equation (A.3) used
