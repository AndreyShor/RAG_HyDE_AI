two-point function can be calculated by following the arrows starting from the trivial
graphical function which is equal to 1. The symbol ∆−1 means appending an edge and

dzdz is integration over z.
for three different orders in ϵ where we reached dimension 10 and spin 7 for order ϵ0, dimension 10 and
spin 5 for order ϵ2, and dimension 8 and spin 4 for order ϵ4.
9. Integration over z
There exist three options for the transition from graphical functions to two-point functions and periods.
Firstly, one can specify the external vertex z to 0, 1, or ∞, which transforms a three-point amplitude
into a two-point amplitude. This simple method was used to calculate the zigzag periods in [7].
Secondly, one can integrate over z in integer dimensions using a residue theorem which was developed
in [17]. In non-integer dimensions, the residue theorem cannot yet be used. A generalization to non-
integer dimensions needs to control functions with powers of log |z−z| which are not GSVHs because they
are singular on the entire real axis. A method that handles this difficulty has not yet been developed.
Thirdly, one can integrate over z by the following practical method. One can add a scalar edge of
weight −1 between the external vertices 0 and z. Then, one appends a scalar edge of weight 1 to z.
Finally, setting z = 0 gives the integral of the original graph over z, see Figure 4. This method is fully
general but more time-consuming than the residue theorem in integer dimension. It seems inefficient
to calculate a graphical function in the intermediate step only to specialize it to z = 0.
For scalar
graphs, however, integration over z was typically not the bottleneck of the calculations. The situation is
somewhat worse with non-zero spin (depending an the size of |α|), so that ultimately it may be useful to
generalize the second method that uses the residue theorem.
