For convenience, we introduce Wannier wave functions [60],
|λ, ⃗x, ∆⟩≡
Z
dd−1⃗p
(2π)d−1 e−i⃗p·⃗x|λ, ⃗p, ∆⟩.
(II.15)
In this representation, the operators D and Pi act as
D|λ, ⃗x, ∆⟩= (xµ∂µ + (d −1 −∆O)λ∂λ) |λ, ⃗x, ∆⟩,
Pi|λ, ⃗x, ∆⟩= ∂i|λ, ⃗x, ∆⟩.
(II.16)
This allows us to determine the action of Ki from the confor-
mal algebra,
Kj|λ, ⃗x, ∆⟩= (2(d −1 −∆O)xiλ∂λ
+(2xi(x · ∂) −x2∂i)

|λ, ⃗x, ∆⟩.
(II.17)
Now we consider the dense subset HD∆⊂H∆, where for
any |f⟩∈HD∆the following limit exists
∃lim
λ→∞⟨λ, ⃗x, ∆|f⟩⇒|⃗x, ∆⟩= w-lim
λ→∞|λ, ⃗x, ∆⟩.
(II.18)
In general this weak limit might not exist or could simply
be zero [61]. Physically, this amounts to demanding a well-
defined IR limit of correlation functions of ˆO (and the de-
fect) with bulk local operators. It is straightforward to check
that the limit states |⃗x, ∆⟩form a representation of the algebra
{Pi, D, Kj, Mij}. For instance, for any state |f⟩∈HD∆
lim
λ→∞⟨f|ebD|λ, ⃗x⟩= lim
λ→∞⟨f|λeb(d−1−∆), eb⃗x⟩
= ⟨f|eb⃗x⟩
⇒
ebD |⃗x⟩= |eb⃗x⟩.
(II.19)
where ∆dependence is implicit. From Appendix C, we show
that for all ⃗x, the limit is the same in (II.18),
|⃗x, ∆⟩= |B, ∆⟩,
(II.20)
which is a linear combination of Ishibashi states correspond-
ing to scalar primaries.
After having analyzed the spectrum of ˆO∆, we are ready to
deal with its exponential in (II.1),
D ≡w-lim
∆→∞w-lim

(II.21)
by introducing a cutoff Λ on the spectrum of ˆO∆and then tak-
ing weak limits. Before these limits, the renormalized defect
is defined via minimal subtraction as
D∆(h, Λ) ≡

with a normalization factor N which we will fix later. The
following weak limit clearly exists,

dd−1⃗p
(2π)d−1 |Λ, ⃗p, ∆⟩⟨Λ, ⃗p, ∆| ,
(II.23)
where we have used that
lim
h→∞heh(λ−Λ)θ(Λ −λ) = δ(Λ −λ).
(II.24)
Taking weak limit Λ →∞, using (II.18) together with (II.20)
and then ∆→∞, we obtain
D = |B⟩⟨B| ,
|B⟩∝w-lim
∆→∞|B, ∆⟩,
(II.25)
where we have absorbed the normalization constants in (II.23)
and the IR volume factor into |B⟩, which is a linear combina-
tion of Ishibashi states. By locality, we expect |B⟩to be an
indecomposable Cardy state of the CFT and its normalization
is fixed this way.
Let us comment on the extensions to (II.1) when the pin-
ning flow preserves additional global symmetries. This hap-
pens when ˆO commutes with the corresponding topological
defects. Correspondingly, the spectrum of ˆO has degenera-
cies due to the symmetry action (fusion with the topological
defects). When the symmetry preserved is finite, this leads
to a finite direct sum of factorized interfaces in the IR for the
pinning defect,
D =
X
α
|Bα⟩⟨Bα| ,
(II.26)
where the individual Cardy states |Bα⟩furnish a representa-
tion of the symmetry. We will see concrete examples in Sec-
tion IV.
If the symmetry is continuous, we have instead an integral
over the factorization channels,
D =
Z
dα|Bα⟩⟨Bα| ,
(II.27)
for a spectral measure dα invariant under the symmetry. For
example if α labels the elements of a continuous group sym-
metry G, dα is proportional to the Haar measure on G. In the
case of spontaneous G-symmetry breaking on the interface,
this measure arises from the path integral over the Goldstone
bosons localized at the interface. For 3d, there is no spon-
taneous continuous symmetry breaking [62], but this form of
factorization (II.27) persists (see Section IV B).
The factorized form of the pinning defect derived here
makes their IR fusion product ◦defined in [20] (see also [21–
23, 63–66]) more transparent. In particular, the defect self-
fusion follows an idempotent rule,
D ◦D(Σ) = S(Σ)D(Σ) ,
(II.28)
where Σ is the defect worldvolume and S denotes the fusion
coefficient theory (CFT) on Σ and S(Σ) is its partition func-
tion. Here we have used that the boundary states |Bα⟩in the
factorization of D are related by symmetries and the Casimir
energy densities Eαβ for a pair of such boundaries defined by
⟨Bα|e−zPd|Bβ⟩
z→0
−−−→e−

zd−1 Eαβ ,
(II.29)
with IR regulator A for the defect volume, satisfies
Eαβ = Eβα ≥Eαα = Eββ ,
