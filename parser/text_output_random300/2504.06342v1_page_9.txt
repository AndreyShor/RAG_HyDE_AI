where 𝑅0 = 0.22 × 10−12 (Cappellaro et al. 1999;
Maoz et al. 2014), slightly lower than Ciotti & Os-
triker (2012), ℎ= 𝐻0/100 km s−1 Mpc−1 = 0.75
(Cappellaro et al. 1999), 𝐿B is the B-band stellar
luminosity, and 𝑠= 1.1. At each time step Δ𝑡, we
sample a local random number from this Poisson
distribution to determine the number of SN events.
A key property of the Poisson distribution ensures
that the accumulated samples over time converge to
the expectation value 𝜇sn, maintaining consistency
with the prescribed SN rate in the simulation. Each
type Ia SN injects 𝑀Ia = 1.4 M⊙into the ambi-
ent gas, while type II SNe inject an IMF-averaged
mass of 𝑀II = 16.6 M⊙, based on Sukhbold et al.
(2016). The total energy injected into the ISM per
supernova is 𝐸SN = 0.85 × 1051 erg.
Another significant enhancement in MACER3D
is the implementation of an improved supernova
energy injection prescription. We implement the
scaling relation developed by Martizzi et al. (2015),
derived from high-resolution simulations of su-
pernova explosions in an inhomogeneous medium
with varying densities and metallicities. This sub-
grid prescription offers two key advantages. First,
it incorporates momentum feedback, enabling the
simulation to address the overcooling problem by
directly accounting for momentum transfer from
supernovae. This is particularly crucial in high-
density regions where, due to limited numerical
resolution, radiative cooling would otherwise ar-
tificially dominate and suppress realistic feedback
effects. Second, the prescription accurately cap-
tures both turbulent and thermal energy injection
from multiple concurrent supernova events (Mar-
tizzi et al. 2015), which is essential for modeling
clustered supernova explosions during periods of
elevated supernova activity. While this prescrip-
tion is typically enabled in MACER3D, particularly
for disk (Zou et al. in prep) and dwarf galaxy sim-
ulations (Su et al. in prep), Martizzi et al. (2015)
also mention the heads-up that their fitting formu-
las are not calibrated for and thus less accurate
in low-density ambient medium due to the longer
cooling time, therefore for the simulated ellipticals
in this work which indeed have a low-density ISM,
we adopt the thermal feedback that is widely used
for simulations of ellipticals in the literature (e.g.
Sharma et al. 2014; Li et al. 2020). We also note
that the SN fade radius ranging between 20 pc to
150 pc raised by Li et al. (2020) is well resolved in
our simulations, where the mean resolution within
𝑟< 1kpc (where most of the SN events occur) is
∼7 pc.
2.6. Radiative cooling and heating
Although star formation in MACER3D is imple-
mented as a subgrid model that does not directly
involve cooling for molecular cloud formation, ac-
curate treatment of radiative cooling remains criti-
cal for calculating the cool gas supply to the central
SMBH and star formation. Recent idealized, small-
scale numerical studies have emphasized the fun-
damental role of radiative cooling in the formation,
survival, and destruction of cool (∼104 K) gas in
the ISM and CGM (Armillotta et al. 2016; Armil-
lotta et al. 2017; Gronke & Oh 2018; Gronke et al.
2022) through thermal instabilities (McCourt et al.
2012; Sharma et al. 2012; Ji et al. 2018) and turbu-
lent mixing (Ji et al. 2019; Fielding et al. 2020; Tan
et al. 2021; Yang & Ji 2023). With these consider-
ations in mind, we have significantly enhanced the
radiative cooling and heating model in MACER3D.
The first enhancement involves implementing
more accurate cooling functions. Different from
the empirical fitting formula (Sazonov et al. 2005)
used in MACER2D, we employ a comprehensive 5-
dimensional cooling table generated using Cloudy
(Ferland et al. 2017). This table captures the depen-
dence on gas density 𝑛H, temperature 𝑇, metallicity
𝑍, redshift 𝑧, and AGN radiative flux 𝐹AGN. The
redshift dependence incorporates both ultraviolet
background (UVB) and cosmic microwave back-
ground (CMB) radiation.
The cooling function
spans an extensive range of physical parameters
relevant to our simulations: 𝑛H = 10−8 −104 cm−3,
𝑍= 10−10, 10−3 −10 𝑍⊙, 𝑧= 0 −10, 𝑇=
102−109 K, and 𝐹AGN = 0, 10−7−107 erg s−1 cm−2.
