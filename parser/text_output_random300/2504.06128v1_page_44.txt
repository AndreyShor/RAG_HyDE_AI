For such values of x, y we have |x ´ y| ď 2
b
W `
N , so the logarithm in the LHS of (2.23) is
bounded from below by
log

N “ log LN
WN ´ tN ´ log 5 “ log LN
WN ´ op|ϑN|q ,
(A.9)
where the first inequality holds for large N because W `
N ě WN Ñ 8, see (2.19). This yields
the RHS of (2.23).
To get an upper bound, we fix ξN Ñ 8 with ξN “ op|ϑN|q and we define the scale
VN :“ W ´
N e´ξN “ WN e´tN´ξN which is smaller than W ´
N . For |x ´ y| ě ?VN, we can
bound from above the logarithm in (2.23) by logp1 `
LN
1`VN q ď logp1 ` LN
VN q. In case LN
VN ď 1
this is at most log 2 “ op|ϑN|q, while in case LN
VN ą 1 we obtain the upper bound

which agrees with the RHS of (2.23). We are left with showing that the range |x´y| ă ?VN
gives a negligible contribution of order op|ϑN|q to the sum in (2.23).
For fixed y, we apply the second relation in (A.8) to estimate the sum over x in (2.23):

for some C ă 8, by Riemann sum approximation. Since
VN

while if LN

where the last equality holds by (2.18) and (2.19). The proof is completed.
