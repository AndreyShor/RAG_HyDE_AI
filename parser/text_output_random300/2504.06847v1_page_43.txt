The computation named “B3LYP-advanced” employed the B3LYP functional, the 
pob_TZVP basis set [S5] for the phosphorus atoms, the 8-411d11G basis set [S6] for the oxygen 
atoms and the 6-31G(d) basis set for all other atoms. For sampling the Brillouin zone, the Pack–
Monkhorst and Gilat nets were each of 8 points. 
 
The computation named “PBESOL0” employed the PBESOL0 functional and used the POB-
TZVP basis set for all atoms. The choice of this computational approach was inspired by its 
previous successful use in the theoretical study of guanylurea(1+) hydrogen phosphite (GUHP) 
properties [S7]. For sampling the Brillouin zone, the Pack–Monkhorst and Gilat nets were each 
of 12 points. Dispersion effects were accounted for by including the Grimme DFT-D3 
correction [S8], damped with the Becke-Johnson damping (BJ) [S9] (s6=1.000, a1=0.4466, 
s8=2.9491, a2=6.1742) and the Axildor-Teller-Muto three-body dispersion correction. The basis 
set superposition error (BSSE) was corrected by geometrical counterpoise involving automatic 
parameter setup [S10]. 
 
In all three cases, derivatives needed for computing IR and Raman spectra were obtained by 
the coupled-perturbed Kohn–Sham analytical approach [S11, S12]. Unit cell parameters were 
kept at experimental values in all cases. The starting atomic coordinates were those obtained 
from diffraction experiments; they were optimized using tightened convergence criteria. 
Spectral properties were computed on the obtained stationary-point geometries. Theoretical 
Raman spectra were corrected for experimental wavelength 1064 nm and temperature 293 K. 
Vibrational frequencies obtained from computations were scaled uniformly by an empirical 
factor of 0.97 (both B3LYP computation) or 0.96 (PBESOL0 computation). 
 
SHG measurements 
 
Initial SHG measurements on 2-AmpH2PO3 were performed using the modified Kurtz-
Perry powder method [45]. The samples were irradiated with 160 fs laser pulses generated at 
an 82 MHz repetition rate by a Ti: sapphire laser (MaiTai, Spectra-Physics) at 800 nm. For 
quantitative determination of the SHG efficiency, the intensity of back-scattered laser light at 
400 nm generated in the sample was measured by a grating spectrograph with a diode array 
(USB2000+, Ocean Optics) and the signal was compared with that produced by a potassium 
dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) standard. The first experiments were performed on a powdered 
sample (100-150 m particle size) loaded into a 5 mm glass cell by using a mechanical vibrator. 
The measurements were repeated in different areas of the same sample, and the results were 
averaged. This experimental procedure minimizes the signal fluctuations induced by sample 
packing. Subsequently, the measurements were performed also with size-fractioned samples 
(particle size: 25-45, 45-63, 63-75, 75-100, 100-125, and 125-150 m). Lastly, the optical 
damage threshold experiments with 800 and 1000 nm laser pulses were performed. 
 
The standard Maker fringe method [46] was used for the determination of the individual 
components of the second order nonlinear optical tensor [𝑑𝑖𝑗𝑘
𝑆𝐻𝐺] of single crystal samples of 2-
AmpH2PO3. SHG measurements with plane parallel samples placed on a computer-driven 
rotational stage were performed using a Q-switched Nd-YAG laser (6 ns pulses at 20 Hz, λ = 
1064 nm). For the quantitative determination of the SHG efficiency, the intensity of the filtered 
SHG signal at 532 nm generated in the sample was measured by a photomultiplier with a boxcar 
averager, and the signal was compared with that generated in KDP [66]. The samples were 
single crystalline polished plates of 3x2 mm2 to 5x4 mm2 area and thickness ranging from 0.5 
mm to 1 mm, oriented either perpendicularly to the particular principal axis of the optical 
indicatrix or at 45º relative to these axes for non-diagonal components determination.
