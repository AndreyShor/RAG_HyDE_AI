ABSTRACT
As an interesting subclass of gamma-ray burst (GRB), Type IL GRB (such as GRB 211211A and
GRB 230307A) features a long-duration prompt emission but originating from compact binary merger.
The “long duration” emisison of Type IL GRB are dominately composed of the main burst, rather
than the extended emission, differentiating them from the traditional “long-short” GRB (e.g., GRB
060614). Previous study has reported several Type IL GRBs by visual inspection of their light curves.
In this work, we established a detailed criterion to identify Type IL GRBs by light curve, and then
systematically searched the archival Fermi/GBM data with this criterion, resulting in a sample of 5
type IL GRBs from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2024, i.e. GRB 230307A, GRB 211211A, GRB
200914A, GRB 200311A and GRB 170228A. Apart from the light curve pattern, we find that the
temporal and spectral properties of these 5 GRBs also support this classification. Interestingly, we
find that the energy ratio between extended emission and main emission is almost constant (∼0.7,
with small scattering) for these GRBs, which have strong implication on the mechanism of Type IL
burst. We discuss theoretical models to interpret the progenitor, central engine, and extended emission
of these Type IL bursts.

1. INTRODUCTION
As one of the most violent explosive events in the
universe, Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been stud-
ied intensively since the discovery in 1960s.
In 1981,
GRBs were classified as long bursts and short bursts
in KONUS experiments (Mazets et al. 1981). In 1993,
the most well-known classification criterion for GRBs
was proposed (Kouveliotou et al. 1993a), that is the T90
(time interval with accumulated GRB photon counts in-
crease from 5% to 95% of the full burst) was found to ex-
hibit a bimodal distribution with a separation of about
2 seconds. This classification divides GRBs into “long”
bursts and “short” bursts.

Since the duration usually reflects the activity time
of the central engine of the GRB; its bimodal distri-
bution also implies the existence of two distinct cate-
gories of central engines, which further corresponds to
two different origin models for GRBs, namely Type I
(usually short) and Type II (usually long) GRBs (Zhang
2006). Type I bursts are produced by the merger of com-
pact binaries consisting of binary neutron stars (BNS)
or neutron star-black hole system (NS-BH) (Blinnikov
et al. 1984; Paczynski 1986; Meszaros & Rees 1992; Li
& Paczy´nski 1998), while Type II bursts are related to
the core collapse of supermassive stars (Woosley 1993;
Paczy´nski 1998; Woosley & Bloom 2006).
Apart from the main emission, there are two com-
ponents in the prompt emission which usually affect
the calculation of the duration: precursor and extended
emission (EE). The precursor generally refers to a brief
period of weaker emission occurring before the main
