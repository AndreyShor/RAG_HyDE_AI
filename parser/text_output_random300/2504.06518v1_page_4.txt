For the large 𝑄2 limit, the LF momenta for reaction (1) are chosen as follows:

rest frame. The high energy nature of this process results in, 𝑝+

𝑄2 ≫𝑚𝑁, which makes Δ−
term to be suppressed by the large 𝑝+
𝑑factor in Eq.(4), allowing to treat
Δ−
2𝑚𝑁as a small parameter.
Keeping the leading, O0( Δ−
2𝑚𝑁), terms in Eq.(5) and using the boost invariance of the wave
function we calculate it in the CM of the deuteron[7] to obtain:

Since the term related to Γ5 is proportional to

𝛼1(2−𝛼1) −𝑀2
𝑑, which diminishes at small momenta,
only the Γ1 and Γ2 terms will contribute in the nonrelativistic limit defining the 𝑆- and 𝐷- components
of the deuteron. Thus, the LF wave function in Eq.(7) provides a smooth transition to the non-
relativistic deuteron wave function. This can be seen by expressing Eq.(7) through two-component
spinors:

This relation is known for 𝑝𝑛-component deuteron wave function[12? ], which allows us to model
the LF wave function through known radial 𝑆- and 𝐷- wave functions evaluated at LF relative
momentum 𝑘defined in Eq.(4).
The new result is that due to the Γ5 term there is an additional leading contribution, which
