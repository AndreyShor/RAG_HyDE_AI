Introduction
Observations have conﬁrmed the ubiquitous nature of magnetic ﬁelds [1]. Nonetheless, the
origin of cosmic magnetic ﬁelds is still unclear. Observational signatures of magnetic ﬁelds
in inter-galactic void regions [2–5] imply a cosmological origin of large-scale magnetic ﬁelds,
due to the diﬃculty to account for them in astrophysical mechanisms [6].
Understanding the origin of large-scale magnetic ﬁelds is a longstanding problem. The
blazar observations suggest that the strength of magnetic ﬁelds with a coherence length of a
few Mpc should be larger than 10−15 Gauss [7, 8]. It is generically believed that primordial
