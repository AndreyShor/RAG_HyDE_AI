The same formula holds also for i “ 1 provided we define

Remark 4.4. The switching off of the noise ensures that the “initial distribution” µN,i´1
in (4.28) is sufficiently smooth, as we show below. This will be needed in the next steps to
compute the variance and to estimate the moments of ∆N,i from (4.9).
Representation (4.28) is very useful. For instance, recalling (4.8), we can compute
mN,i´1 “ P

D ˜
Ni X DNi

Note that for SNi´1 „ µN,i´1, we have |SNi´1| ď
b
Ni´1 log

δ2
N due to the restriction to the
event DNi´1, see (4.27) and (4.23). Therefore for any i “ 1, . . . , M, we can bound
mN,i´1 ě 1 ´ P

Since Ni´1 ! ˜Ni ! Ni, see (4.5) and (4.6), arguing as in (4.25), we have: for some C ă 8,
for i “ 1, . . . , M :
1 ´ C pδ2

C ď mN,i´1 ď 1 .
(4.30)
We conclude this step by showing that the polymer distribution µN,ipxq is close to the
random walk transition kernel qNi´ ˜
Nipxq, see (1.14). Intuitively, this holds because:
‚ we switched off disorder between times ˜Ni and Ni, see (4.27), therefore the polymer
evolves between these times as simple random walk;
‚ we know that |S ˜
Ni| ď
b ˜Ni log
1
δ2
N (due to the event D ˜
Ni), therefore |S ˜
Ni| ! ?Ni by
the choice of ˜Ni in (4.6). To compute SNi, we can therefore pretend that S ˜
Ni » 0,
namely we can approximate SNi ´ S ˜
Ni » SNi´ ˜
Ni, which is distributed as qNi´ ˜
Nip¨q.
Let us now be precise: we set for short
