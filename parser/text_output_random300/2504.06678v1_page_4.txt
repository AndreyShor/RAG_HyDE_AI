1 (1 →2): Ω12, the detuning ∆12 = E2 −E1 −ω(1) and
Laser 2 (2 →3): Ω23, the detuning ∆23 = E3−E2−ω(2)).
The laser parameters are calibrated as follows: The
laser operates with a Rabi frequency of Ω13 = 2π ×
10MHz and a detuning of ∆13 = 2π × 5MHz.
Two
additional lasers are employed, with the first exhibiting
Ω12 = 2π × 8MHz and ∆12 = −2π × 3MHz, while the
second features Ω23 = 2π × 6MHz and ∆23 = 2π ×
4MHz. Dynamic control is implemented via an acousto-
optic modulator (AOM), enabling laser intensity adjust-
ments with 10 ns resolution for precise system modula-
tion.
Using Rabi frequency Ωand detuning ∆as co-
ordinates, construct a circular critical region:m(Ω, ∆) =

(Ω−Ωc)2 + (∆−∆c)2 −R where Ωc = Ω13,∆c = ∆13
(parameters corresponding to the direct path) and Ring
radius is R = 0.5 ×Ω13, and we obtain dynamic path
modulation by (as shown in Fig.2): direct path 1 →3:
Straight path (Ω(t), ∆(t)) = (Ω13 · t/T, ∆13 · t/T) and
indirect path 1 →2 →3: Nonlinear parameterization to
encircle the ring region:
Ω(t) = Ω12 · sin(πt/T) + Ω23 · sin(2πt/T)

∆(t) = ∆12 · cos(πt/T) + ∆23 · cos(2πt/T)

Accumulation of corre-
lated noise leads to fidelity attenuation Freal ≈1 −
( 16.5×10−4π

)2 ≈0.9993. Therefore, by controlling noise
sources to design paths that bypass intermediate states,
high fidelity levels are maintained.
The dynamic control of the system is achieved through
an acousto-optic modulator (AOM), which enables pre-
cise adjustment of the laser intensity with a time resolu-
tion, thereby facilitating the dynamic modulation of Ω(t).
Two lasers are simultaneously locked to an ultra-stable
F-P cavity to achieve phase locking. To characterize the
topological response of the system, Ramsey interferom-
etry is employed to measure the geometric phase differ-
ence across different paths, verifying the equivalence of
quasi-topological numbers. Furthermore, quantum state
tomography is utilized to reconstruct the density matrix
through fluorescence imaging, allowing for direct obser-
vation of the path evolution process.
By reconstructing the parameter space and imple-
menting dynamic modulation, we demonstrate the strict
equivalence of the quasi-topological numbers for the 1 →
2 →3 and 1 →3 paths in the Rydberg atomic sys-
tem.
This is achieved by designing a circular critical
region in the parameter space, which forces the indirect
path to encircle the same topological charge as the di-
rect path.
The nonlinear parameterization of the sys-
tem is realized through the cooperative modulation of the
dual lasers, ensuring the equivalence of path projections.
Finally, the quasi-topological number νqua ≈1/(2π) is
verified through numerical calculations and experimental
measurements of the Berry curvature integration. This
scheme provides an experimentally verifiable blueprint
for topological quantum control on the Rydberg atomic
platform.
νqua drive high-fidelity quantum computing and AGP
fitting—The introduction of the counterdiabatic (CD)
protocol can correct a non-adiabatic computational pro-
cess with rapidly changing parameters back into an adi-
abatic process. Under AGP corrections, the topological
properties of non-closed parameter paths reduce the sys-
tem’s dependence on environmental stability.
As long
as we can manipulate the initial and final states of quan-
tum bit evolution, we can design noise-resistant and high-
fidelity geometric quantum gates based on the aforemen-
tioned theoretical framework.
