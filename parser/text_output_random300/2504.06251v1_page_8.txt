Fig. 2 | Experimental electronic structure and flat band of non-aligned R5G/BN (sample
S2 and S3). a, Intensity maps measured at energies from EF to -0.6 eV on sample S2, with
photon energy of 75 eV under left circular (LC) polarization. b-e, Dispersion images measured
on sample S3 along momentum cuts near the K point, as indicated by black and red lines in a.
The photon energy is 95 eV under linear horizontal (LH) polarization. f-i, Calculated dispersion
images corresponding to b-e. j, Comparison of dispersion image measured through the K point
(d) and calculated dispersion (h, red broken curves). k, Atomic structure of R5G, where hopping
parameters γ0 to γ4 are labeled. l-n, Intensity maps measured at energies of -0.1, -0.2 and -0.7 eV
on sample S2. Red, orange and blue dotted curves are calculation results to show the reverse of
warping direction. o,p, Calculated energy contours of the top valence band at energies from -0.1 to
-0.7 eV for γ3 = 0.11 eV and γ3 = -0.11 eV, respectively. Red, orange and blue curves correspond
to energies of l-n.
