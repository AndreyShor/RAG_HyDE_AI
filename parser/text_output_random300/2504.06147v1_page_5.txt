The Picard-Fuchs operator for the mirror manifold of (1.1) has AESZ number 17.
LAESZ17 = 25θ4 −15φ(5 + 30θ + 72θ2 + 84θ3 + 51θ4) + 6φ2(15 + 155θ + 541θ2 + 828θ3 + 531θ4)
−54φ3(1170 + 3795θ + 4399θ2 + 2160θ3 + 423θ4)
+ 243φ4(402 + 1586θ + 2270θ2 + 1368θ3 + 279θ4) −59049φ5(1 + θ4),
θ = φ d
dφ.
(1.2)
As can be seen by collecting like powers of φ and inspecting the polynomials in θ that multiply the
extreme powers φ0 and φ5, this differential operator has a MUM point at φ = ∞in addition to
the expected one at φ = 0. Monodromies for solutions obtained as expansions about φ = 0 have
been analysed in [25]. Below we reproduce the Riemann symbol for AESZ17.

Table 1: Riemann symbol for AESZ17
This example (1.1) has seen additional previous study.
The mirror variety’s moduli space was
found to possess a rank-two attractor point in [23, 26], but more relevant to our current paper is
the realisation in those works that it is highly nontrivial to construct an integral symplectic basis
by making a linear transformation on a Frobenius basis of solutions expanded about φ = ∞. The
argument of [23, 26], which we recall and add to in §3.3, runs as follows. Assuming that there
is a smooth mirror geometry associated to both MUM points φ = 0, ∞, then they must both
have the same Euler characteristic because mirror symmetry exchanges Hodge numbers. The Euler
characteristic of (1.1) is computed to be −30. Now seek a change of basis matrix that acts on
the Frobenius basis associated to φ = ∞, and appeal to the results of [27–29] that provide such
a change of basis matrix whose entries are topological data of the mirror manifold based on the
structure of the genus 0 prepotential. This allows one to read off the ratio of the triple intersection
number and the Euler characteristic, leading to a value of −30/13 for the triple intersection when
χ = −30 is imposed. Clearly an assumption must fail. We will resolve this using considerations of
[4] that hold for noncommutative resolutions of singular Calabi-Yau threefolds.
We begin this paper with a study of the GLSM. To analyse the stringy K¨ahler moduli space of
(1.1), we show that it can be realised as the “large volume” phase of a non-abelian GLSM with
gauge group (U(1) × U(1) × U(1)) ⋊Z3.
A Coulomb branch analysis confirms the location of
three singular points at the phase boundary which coincide with the three points in the table
above that have indices (0,1,1,2). Against our expectations, the other phase does not look like
a geometry at all. Rather, we find a hybrid model: The vacuum manifold is a P2. It forms the
base of a Landau-Ginzburg fibration with a cubic potential. To our knowledge, all the multiple-
MUM models studied so far could, at intermediate energy scales, be interpreted as hybrid models
with quadric potentials, meaning that these theories are massive. The geometry deep in the IR
is then encoded in the properties of the mass matrix.
This mechanism does not apply to our
