dimension of our physical space. In contrast, certain definitions do not require integer values,
such as the Hausdorff dimension, which becomes essential for describing fractal manifolds [1].
Consider a sheet of paper, modeled topologically as two-dimensional. When crumpled,
however, it assumes a different effective fractal dimension. We can estimate this physically by
measuring the crumpled paper’s density. Solid objects have densities scaling as r−3 (where r
represents a characteristic length), yielding d = 3 as a dimensionality estimate that coincides
with the topological dimension. The crumpled paper, however, follows a different scaling rela-
tion, typically r−deff, where 2 < deff < 3. This simple example illustrates a crucial insight: the
physical dimension may be neither trivial nor externally fixed. Rather, it requires a “physical
estimator”, a concept central to this work, analogous to the density in our example.
Such estimators become vital in quantum realms, where direct dimensional experience is
impossible. Quantum field theory (QFT) provides a natural dimension estimator through the
Green function. In Euclidean space, this function diverges as r−(d−2) at short distances. Con-
ventionally, dimension is treated as a fixed external parameter conditioned by macroscopic ex-
perience. However, we can invert this logic: we examine Green function behavior at short
distances to estimate the spacetime dimension 1. This transforms dimension into an observable
quantity that may differ from the topological dimension d, an approach we adopt throughout
this paper.
How should dimension differ from large-scale observations? Space-time could possess in-
trinsic fractal properties, causing fields to experience a different dimension than the topological
one. The idea of a rough spacetime was first proposed by Wheeler who called it spacetime
foam [3] – see also [4, 5]. We shall broadly refer to the roughness (non-differentiability) of
spacetime as “fractal spacetime”. While string theory often suggests topological dimensions
exceeding four (albeit warped), many quantum gravity approaches propose the opposite: di-
mensional reduction. Theories including Causal Dynamical Triangulations [6–8], Asymptotic
Safety [9, 10], Causal Set Theory [11], and Loop Quantum Gravity [12] suggest that effective
dimension flows continuously from four at large scales to two at short distances. Additional
perspectives appear in [13,14]. A model universe with variable dimension is presented in [15].
This article examines this phenomenon from the QFT perspective, broadening the seminal
work of [16] on QFT formulation in fractal spacetime in many directions. The propagator, cen-
tral to QFT, can serve as a dimensional estimator through running couplings. We investigate
how canonical quantization should be modified to accommodate fractal space-time and dimen-
sional reduction. Our findings reveal a straightforward generalization of canonical quantization
that significantly enhances QFT consistency. First, the theory becomes finite at all orders in
perturbation theory. Second, the behavior of the perturbative series is improved since the lead-

variational principle.
