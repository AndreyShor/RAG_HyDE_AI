Fig.2 | Decadal variability of the GMOC and associated physical modes in coupled reanalyses. a‒d, 5‒20 years 
filtering of time series for GMOC (a), North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) (b), Antarctic Circumpolar Current 
residual circulation (ACC-RC) (c) and tropical diffusive mixing (εm) indices (d). The correlation coefficients 
between various curves and observational products are listed within a box in b and c. The correlation coefficients 
between the two model simulations and those between the two CDA estimates are listed within a box in a and d. 
The calculation periods of all correlation coefficients are consistent with those of ORAS5.
