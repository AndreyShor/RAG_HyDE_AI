Porosity and pore size distribution
Pore characteristics play a fundamental role in determining a rock’s effective material properties, including fluid transport
[Soulaine et al., 2016, Nelson, 1994], mechanical behavior [Zhang and Bentley, 2003], and electrical conductivity
[Wong et al., 1984]. The registered CT and TS images yield porosities of 0.154 and 0.232, respectively, indicating that
the TS image reveals approximately 50 % more porosity than the CT plane. Figure 10 shows the pore size distributions
obtained from both images. Both exhibit a left-skewed distribution, indicating a higher frequency of smaller pores, as
reported in previous studies [Andriamihaja et al., 2019, Yao et al., 2013].
In addition, the TS image reveals thousands of smaller pores with radii below 8.02 µm (the CT pixel size). Beyond
submicron pore recovery, the TS image also shows a notable reduction in pore sizes compared to the CT image, even
for pores larger than the CT resolution limit. These two factors—submicron pore recovery and overall pore size
reduction—result in a mean pore radius of 7.52 µm in the TS image, compared to 18.80 µm in the CT image, meaning
pores appear 2.5 times larger in CT than in TS. This suggests that TS images can provide valuable corrections for
common biases in CT-derived porosity and permeability estimates, where CT imaging underestimates porosity and
overestimates permeability [Saxena et al., 2019a, 2017b].

Effective elastic moduli
Next, we compute the effective elastic moduli of the paired images using an FFT-based solver in GeoDict [GmbH,
2025] under a plane strain approximation. Specifically, we assume a two-phase composite, where all solid material is
considered quartz, and the remaining regions are pores, based on the primary components of Berea Sandstone [Saxena
et al., 2019b]. A nonzero strain of ε11 = ε22 = 0.001 and 2ε12 = 0.001 is applied, along with the physical properties
listed in Table 3. Once the averaged stress (σ) and strain (ε) are obtained, the bulk and shear moduli of the 2D composite
are computed as follows [Saxena and Mavko, 2016]:
