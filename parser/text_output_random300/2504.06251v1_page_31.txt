Extended Data Fig. 8 | Enhanced flat band in aligned R5G/BN along Γ-K direction. a,
Experimental dispersion image measured along Γ-K direction in aligned sample S1. b, Same as a
with extracted flat band dispersion and spectral weight overplotted as red dots. c. Extracted EDCs
from momentum as indicated by short ticks in a. d, Experimental dispersion image measured
along Γ-K direction in non-aligned sample S3. e, Same as d with extracted flat band dispersion
and spectral weight overplotted as red dots. f, Extracted EDCs from momentum as indicated by
short ticks in e. The color and size of red dots in all panels correspond to the spectral weight of the
band.
