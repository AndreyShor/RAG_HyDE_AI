Sym+(n) lies on the Riemannian manifold of SPD
matrices, aligning nicely with subsequent quantum
embedding steps.
Quantum Embedding and Hybrid Architecture.. We
next project or reshape Z as needed and normalize
the resulting vector for amplitude encoding into a
quantum state. This ensures that data geometry
(via SPD) is retained upon entering the quantum
subsystem. The overall pipeline (Fig. 1) has:
1. A few classical neural network layers to han-
dle basic transformations, possibly reducing di-
mension or extracting coarse features.
2. A quantum circuit component, implemented
in a framework like PennyLane, that acts on
amplitude-encoded vectors.
This circuit can
consist of parameterized single-qubit rotations
(e.g., Rx, Ry, Rz gates) and entangling gates
(e.g., CNOTs).
3. A final classical post-processing layer to map
the quantum circuit’s measurement outputs to
the 1017-dimensional predicted response.

pipeline. SPD matrices (or vectors derived from them) feed
into a variational quantum circuit. Post-measurement classi-
cal layers map qubit measurements to the high-dimensional
FEM response.

Experimental Evaluation.. We tested multiple con-
figurations—varying how many classical layers pre-
ceded or followed the quantum subsystem—to find
an optimal balance between classical feature engi-
neering and quantum expressivity. Table 1 summa-
rizes key outcomes.

(SPD) can preserve important structural correla-
tions, which quantum embeddings then exploit.
By embedding SPD-based features into a varia-
tional quantum circuit, we leverage entanglement
and interference effects in a manner that classical
MLPs alone struggle to replicate.
Crucially, the
pipeline can handle the large (7 →1017) dimen-
sion shift more gracefully by distributing complex-
ity across both manifold-based preprocessing and
quantum transformations.
Implications for Real-Time SHM.. Our results un-
derscore that hybrid QML frameworks, guided by
GML principles, are not mere theoretical constructs
but can indeed boost performance for real-world en-
gineering tasks such as bridge FEM. Although we
used a quantum simulator here, the approach is de-
signed to transfer to NISQ or future fault-tolerant
quantum devices, offering a potentially scalable
route to real-time structural health monitoring.
Tie-Back to Geometric-Quantum Synergy.
In summary, our SHM experiments underscore the
key role of SPD manifold geometry when combined
with quantum embeddings. By constructing SPD
matrices from FEM-based sensor data and then
exploiting quantum transformations, we leverage
both classical manifold structure and entanglement-
driven expressivity. These findings are consistent
with the central thesis of this paper: that respect-
ing non-Euclidean geometry within quantum ML
pipelines can provide a demonstrable advantage,
even when hardware constraints limit us to hybrid
simulations.

Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) pose a significant
challenge in healthcare, given the risk of complica-
tions such as infection and ischaemia that can lead
to amputation. As part of our investigation into ge-
ometric quantum-classical learning, we developed a
DFU classification pipeline that integrates a modi-
fied Xception network with a variational quantum
