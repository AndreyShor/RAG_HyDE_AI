One of the important features of nuclear forces is their strong repulsive nature at short (≤0.5 −
0.6 Fm) distances which prevents atomic nuclei from collapsing, thus guarantying the stability for
the visible matter. However the dynamical nature of this repulsion (referred to as a nuclear core) is
as elusive as ever. We present the study of nuclear dynamics at extremely large internal momenta
in the deuteron dominated by the nuclear core. It is demonstrated that the paradigm shift in the
description of the deuteron consisting of proton and neutron to the description of the deuteron
as a pseudo-vector composite system in which proton and neutron is observed in high energy
electro-disintegration processes results in the emergence of a new structure. We demonstrate that
this new structure can exist only if it emerges from pre-existing non-nucleonic component in the
deuteron. The study of the dynamics of the predicted new structure is presented focusing on the
question if it allows to understand the anomaly observed in the recent experiment at Jefferson Lab
that probed deuteron structure at internal momenta above 800 MeV/c.
