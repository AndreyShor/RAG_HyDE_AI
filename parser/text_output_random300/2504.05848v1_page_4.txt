CLOCK WITH GENERIC SPECTRUM
A.
The generalized quantum clock
We consider here again the clock as a quantum system
described by d = p + 1 energy states |En⟩and En energy
levels with n = 0, 1, 2, ..., p, but we do not assume an
equally-spaced energy spectrum. In this case we can not
ﬁnd a subset of p + 1 time states (3) that are orthogonal
but we can make progress by requiring that the ratios
(En −E0)/(E1 −E0) are rational numbers. Thus we can
write:
En −E0
E1 −E0
= Cn
Bn
(21)
where Cn and Bn are integers with no common factors.
We deﬁne rn = r1Cn/Bn for n > 1, with r1 the lowest
common multiple of the values of Bn with n > 1, and we
take r0 = 0. In this framework the values rn are integers
for all n ≥0. Now we redeﬁne
T =
2πℏr1
E1 −E0
(22)
and then
En = E0 + rn
2πℏ
T .
(23)
In this framework, we introduce again the z + 1 time
states:
|τm⟩=
1
√p + 1
p
X
n=0
e−iℏ−1Enτm |En⟩
(24)
with τm = τ0 +
T
z+1m. These states still satisfy the reso-
lution of the identity, indeed we have:
z
X
m=0
|τm⟩⟨τm| =
1
p + 1

(25)
Replacing the expression of τm in the second term on the right-hand side of the equation (25), we obtain:
z
X
m=0
|τm⟩⟨τm| =
1
p + 1



T (rn−rk)τ0
z
X
m=0
e−i(rn−rk) 2πm
z+1 |En⟩⟨Ek|


.
(26)
For (En −E0)/(E1 −E0) rational, and thus rn −rk an
integer, we have
X
n̸=k
ei 2π
T (rn−rk)τ0
z
X
m=0
e−i(rn−rk) 2πm
z+1 |Ei⟩⟨Ek| = 0
(27)
because Pz
m=0 e−i(rn−rk) 2πm
z+1 = (z + 1)δn,k.
Equation
(26) thus becomes:
p + 1
z + 1
z
X
m=0
|τm⟩⟨τm| = 1.
(28)
We can ensure rn −rk is not a multiple of z +1 by taking
z + 1 > rp, that is the largest value for rn. This implies
that, in this new scenario, the generalized quantum clock
is only described by the POVM, where the z + 1 non-
orthogonal elements are given by p+1
z+1 |τm⟩⟨τm|.
As in the previous Section, since z is lower-bounded,
we can take the limit z →∞, deﬁning the time states as
|t⟩=
1
√p + 1
p
X
n=0
e−iℏ−1Ent |En⟩
(29)
where t ∈[t0, t0 + T ]. The clock is here described by the
POVM generated with the operators p+1
T
|t⟩⟨t| dt and the
resolution of the identity reads
p + 1
T
Z t0+T
t0
dt |t⟩⟨t| = 1.
(30)
To conclude the paragraph we emphasize that this frame-
work allow us to use any generic (discrete) clock Hamil-
