The quantum critical points correspond to the physical roots (A22), when k ∈R, i.e., those
which lie on a unit circle |z±| = 1. Evolution of the positions of the roots on the complex
plane with respect to the unit circle in four different phases is shown in Fig. 4.
With the parametrization (A19), the correlation length and the wave number of oscilla-
tions in the ladder are determined by the couple of conjugate roots z± closest to the unit
circle. The analytical solution for the complex wavenumber k± follows from Eqs. (A19) and
(A22) as

The critical point µc,2 is not a disorder point, since the IC oscillations continuously (albeit
not smoothly) evolve into the filled phase at µ > µc,2, see Fig. 5. Near µc,2

The average occupation number is related to the Lee-Yang zeros as:

Once the branch cuts are chosen to yield the signs as shown in Fig. 5, the above expressions
are applicable through the whole range µ ≥0, reproducing straightforwardly the results for
¯n and χ◦of the previous section, although in a less intuitive way than the derivations based
on the band filling arguments.8
The first expression on the rhs of (A28) helps to connect the results for the Lee-Yang
roots to the generalized LSM theorem [14]: to get an incommensurate filling at least one
8 Note that relating q± to the Fermi momenta kF,1/2 makes sense only in the gapless IC phase. In
particular, P = 0 at µ > µc,2, while q± evolves continuously through µc,2.
