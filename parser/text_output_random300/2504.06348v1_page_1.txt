Abstract
We present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of chemical
systems on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, incorporating both electronic and nuclear quantum de-
grees of freedom. An all-particle simulation is nominally efficient on a quantum computer, but practically
infeasible. Hence, central to our approach is the construction of a first-quantized plane-wave algorithm
making use of pseudoions.
The latter consolidate chemically inactive electrons and the nucleus into
a single effective dynamical ionic entity, extending the well-established concept of pseudopotentials in
quantum chemistry to a two-body interaction. We explicitly describe efficient quantum circuits for initial
state preparation across all degrees of freedom, as well as for block-encoding the Hamiltonian describing
interacting pseudoions and chemically active electrons, by leveraging recent advances in quantum rejec-
tion sampling to optimize the implementations. To extract useful chemical information, we first design
molecular fingerprints by combining density-functional calculations with machine learning techniques,
and subsequently validate them through surrogate classical molecular dynamics simulations. These fin-
gerprints are then coherently encoded on a quantum computer for efficient molecular identification via
amplitude estimation. We provide an extensive analysis of the cost of running the algorithm on a fault-
tolerant quantum computer for several chemically interesting systems. As an illustration, simulating
the interaction between NH3 and BF3 (a 40-particle system) requires 808 logical qubits to encode the
problem, and approximately 1011 Toffoli gates per femtosecond of time evolution. Our results establish
a foundation for further quantum algorithm development targeting chemical and material dynamics.
