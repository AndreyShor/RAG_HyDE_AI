the mass range. However, the additional muon and tau couplings in Scenario U lead to a
non-trivial momentum dependence in the effective Primakoff coupling near the threshold
ma = 2mµ, particularly in the pseudoscalar case. By coincidence, the derivative case is well
approximated by considering only tree-level couplings, i.e. setting the effective ALP-photon
coupling to zero and neglecting both Primakoff production and decays into photons.

Combined Constraints
Having discussed the pertinent differences between pseudoscalar and derivative couplings
for the bounds from E137, as well as the relevance of the momentum dependence in the
effective couplings, we now turn to the various other constraints on leptophilic ALPs. Our
main results are shown in figures 10 to 13, corresponding to the four scenarios introduced
above. In each case, we show in the left (right) panel the constraints for derivative (pseu-
doscalar) couplings. The bounds that have been (re)computed by us, namely the ones
from sections 3 and 4.2, are shown in the foreground, each highlighted with a differently
coloured area. Conversely, the constraints from sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5, which have
been taken directly from the literature, are shown in the background as a unified, gray-
shaded area. Non-binding constraints, namely the ones coming from anomalous magnetic
moments described in section 4.7 and the ALP lifetime discussed in section 4.8, are indi-
cated for reference as dashed lines. Finally, for the NA64µ experiment, we also indicate
projected bounds for a total of 1014 MOT, compared to the current 1.98 · 1010 MOT.
Let us start our discussion from Scenario E, for which bounds are given in figure 10.
Contrary to the previous section, where only contributions from DB and Primakoff produc-
tion were considered for estimating E137 constraints, an additional bump is now present
because we include the resonant ALP production yields as well.4 We find that E137, which
4While resonant ALP production is not possible in NA64µ, it could in principle play a role in NA64
run in invisible and visible modes. However, due to the high cutoff energy Ecut = 20 GeV of NA64, the
condition ma > √2meEcut derived in section 3.3 cannot be satisfied in the parameter regions probed by
NA64.
