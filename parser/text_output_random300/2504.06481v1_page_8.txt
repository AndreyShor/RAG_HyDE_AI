IKKT model has a similar correspondence between representations and spacetime geometries [2],
see §5 below. However, the matrix configurations that dominate at small Ω2N correspond to well-
separated D-instantons. This is consistent with the fact that the approximate partition functions
(19) are obtained from independent Gaussian integrals for the moduli, with no collective effects.
In this limit the matrices do not holographically generate a weakly curved geometry.
We are thinking of the partition function Z as a canonical partition function, where Ω4 is
the inverse temperature. The grand canonical ensemble additionally has a chemical potential β
for the ‘particle number’ N = P
M nMM. We will use the grand canonical ensemble to extract
the individual expectation values ⟨nM⟩. To this end we also introduce sources αM, via the term
P
M αMnM. Using (19), the grand canonical partition function in the small Ω2N limit is
eZ = aN

{nM}

Crucially, the {nM} are now unconstrained. We are going to keep the prefactor aN in terms of
N for simplicity. Our objective here is to impose the partition constraint (3) as an expectation
value, and for this purpose there is no need to write the prefactor in terms of β rather than N.
The unconstrained sums in (20) can be performed one by one to obtain
eZ = aN

The expectation values thus follow an ‘isochemical’ distribution with a classical Boltzmann factor,
⟨nM⟩= ∂log eZ

The grand canonical partition function (21) can then be written as
log eZ

To go back to the canonical partition function one must perform a Legendre transform:
log Z = log eZ −βN ,

where the chemical potential β is fixed in terms of N by imposing (3) as an expectation value
N =

We are working at small Ω2N. In this limit the constraint (25) requires β to be large. It
follows that, to leading order, only the M = 1 term in the sum in (25) contributes and we have
β ≈1
