p ˆSii, defined as the square root of the
diagonal element of the covariance matrix normalized to the value of the theory prediction (red), and
the normalized NNLO-NLO shift δi of Eq. (2.32) (black) for all datapoints. Results are obtained with the
7-point prescription.
This picture can be validated with the plot of Fig. 2.13, where we compare the shifts

It is clear that, for DIS, 7-point scale variations at NLO provide a very conservative uncertainty
estimate that significantly overestimates the NNLO-NLO shift. On the other hand, for hadronic
processes the shift and scale variation estimate are generally comparable in size. Only for DY,
scale variations perform less well, with instances of underestimation of the shift. Whereas this
may suggest adjusting the range of scale variation on a process-by-process basis, it is unclear to
which extent the NLO behavior could be generalized to higher orders.
Perturbative convergence and MHOU uncertainties.
Individual PDFs at NLO and NNLO,
with and without MHOUs, are compared in Fig. 2.14 at Q = 100 GeV. We show the gluon,
singlet and valence distributions (reference for the other non singlet quantities), all shown as
a ratio to the NNLO PDFs with MHOUs. The change in central value due to the inclusion of
