Figure A2. (Top): Spin variables on odd/even sites are transported to the next odd/even sites to the
left/right, respectively, in one update by ˆU, Equation (A7), of the spin chain automaton. (Bottom):
Occupation numbers on neighboring even sites are added to form right-moving block variables,
n2k + n2k+2 =: ˜n2k; likewise, left-moving ones, n2k+1 + n2k+3 =: ˜n2k+1. They are illustrated by
arrows displaced by one unit to the right for better visibility.
In order to arrive at a continuum theory of the automaton which leads to the Weyl
equation, we need to have access to the arithmetic of variables that are allowed to assume
sufficiently large or small integer values, rather than the elementary two-state spins with
sk = ±1 employed so far. It is useful to introduce site occupation numbers:
nk := (sk + 1)/2 (= 0, 1).
(A8)
These can be thought of as eigenvalues of a fermionic number operator ˆn(k), which might
be of interest later. They preserve the feature of variables associated with even/odd sites to
be right-moving/left-moving, respectively, under the updating affected by ˆU. Furthermore,
they inherit the periodic boundary condition.
Next, we perform an invertible linear transformation on the set of occupation numbers
defined by:
˜nk := nk + nk+2, k = 1, . . . , 2s,
(A9)
cf. Figure A2 (bottom). Iterating this transformation a sufficiently large number of r times
we arrive at block variables ˜n(r) that range between zero and 2r. Again, they move left/right
under ˆU from an odd/even site, with periodic boundary conditions.
We remark that the block variables must be distinguished from coarse-grained vari-
ables that would be obtained by some decimation of the number of degrees of freedom.

M and Automaton Update
In Figure A3 we illustrate by two examples how the scattering operator
ˆ
M(k), defined
in Equation (22), acts in the update process of the automaton.
We have shown here an automaton that is very small (with periodic boundary con-
ditions) in the transverse direction for simplicity. Eventually, a numerical simulation of
consecutive updates would be amusing to see for a large automaton—one that follows the
deterministic rules constructed from the Dirac equation in this work.
