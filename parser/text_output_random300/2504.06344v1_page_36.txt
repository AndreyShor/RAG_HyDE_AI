Figure 11. The results of fitting Tr (F13F13) to the ∆expansion for three configurations (one in each
row), obtained by minimizing the lattice action on a lattice of size (32, 4, 12, 12), corresponding to
∆(2, 2, 1) = 0.236. The fits produce a mean squared deviation of ∼10−7, showing excellent agreement
with the ∆expansion.
Left column: the values of Tr (F13F13) obtained from lattice configurations, summed over the 2nd and
4th directions, as a function of x1 and x3.
Right column: the ∆-expansion analytical solution (5.2), for values of the four parameters, the moduli

Here, we use the results of [1] to calculate the quantity Tr (F13F13).
This quantity
vanishes for ∆= 0, and to leading order in ∆is given by

The formula (5.1) can be interpreted as due to the contributions of two identical strongly
overlapping “lumps,” the two non-negative functions appearing in the sum over C′ = 1, 2,
whose only difference is that their locations on the T4 are different, determined by the moduli
