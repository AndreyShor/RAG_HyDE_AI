The above model can be rewritten as
𝜕𝑡U(𝑡, 𝑥) = 𝐷1
𝑥2 𝜕𝑥(𝑥2𝜕𝑥U(𝑡, 𝑥)) + 𝜌U(𝑡, 𝑥) −𝑘𝑡U(𝑡, 𝑥).

The following strategy of [38] and [20]. Let 𝑡= 2𝐷𝑡, 𝑢(𝑡, 𝑥) = 𝑥U(𝑡, 𝑥) with these equation (2.3) leads to

Extended Fisher–Kolmogorov equation
The EFK equation represents a nonlinear biharmonic equation. It is expressed as [23]
𝑢𝑡+ 𝛾∆2𝑢−∆𝑢+ 𝐹(𝑢) = 0,

[0,𝑇] × D,

[0,𝑇] × 𝜕D.
(2.12)
Here, 𝑢𝑡represents the time evolution of the tumor cell density, 𝛾∆2𝑢accounts for higher-order diffusion
(biharmonic diffusion), which influences the tumor’s spatial spread but does not represent treatment, −∆𝑢
corresponds to standard diffusion, describing tumor cell movement, and 𝐹(𝑢) = 𝑢3 −𝑢is a nonlinear reaction term,
modeling tumor proliferation.
In this context, Γ1 and Γ2 denote given functions, while 𝑡∈[0,𝑇], 𝑥∈D ⊂R𝑑and 𝑢∈[0,𝑇] × D →R represents
a confined domain. The parameter 𝛾is a strictly positive constant. An essential characteristic of the EFK equation
is its energy dissipation law, defined through the energies dissipation law, defined through the energy functional
can be written as [41]

The Underlying Abstract PDE
Consider separable Banach spaces 𝑋and 𝑌with norms ∥·∥𝑋and ∥·∥𝑌, respectively.
To be precise, define
𝑌= 𝐿𝑝(D; R𝑚) and 𝑋= 𝑊𝑠,𝑞(D; R𝑚), where 𝑚⩾1, 1 ⩽𝑝, 𝑞< ∞, and 𝑠⩾0, with D ⊂R𝑑for some ¯𝑑⩾1.
D = D𝑇= [0,𝑇] × D ⊂R𝑑. Let 𝑋∗⊂𝑋and 𝑌∗⊂𝑌be closed subspaces equipped with norms ∥·∥𝑋∗and ∥·∥𝑌∗,
respectively. The forward problem is well-posed, as all necessary information is available, while the inverse problem
is inherently ill-posed due to missing or incomplete information.
2.2.1
Forward problems
The abstract formulation of the governing PDE is
D(𝑢) = f,
(2.14)
where D represents a differential operator mapping 𝑋∗to 𝑌∗, and f ∈𝑌∗satisfies the following conditions:
(H1) :
∥D(𝑢)∥𝑌∗< ∞,
∀𝑢∈𝑋∗with ∥𝑢∥𝑋∗< ∞.
(H2) :
∥f ∥𝑌∗< ∞.
(2.15)
Additionally, assume that for each f ∈𝑌∗, a unique solution 𝑢∈𝑋∗exists for (2.14), subject to approximate
boundary and initial conditions given by
B(𝑢) = 𝑢𝑏
on 𝜕D,
𝑢(0, 𝑥) = 𝑢0
on D.
(2.16)
Here, B represents a boundary operator, 𝑢𝑏is the prescribed boundary data, and 𝑢0(𝑥) denotes the initial condition.
