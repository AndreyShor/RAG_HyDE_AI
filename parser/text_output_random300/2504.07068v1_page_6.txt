In the last line, note that S(B1)Φ = S(A1)Φ holds. From the above, we obtain
nQ(n, ǫ) −nE(n, ǫ) = S(M)ν + S(B1)Φ −S(A0)Φ
≥S(RnR′n)ρ −S(BnWBRnR′n)ξ −nδ1(n, ǫ),
(7)
where nE(n, ǫ) = S(A0)Φ −S(A1)Φ. By adding Eq. (6) and Eq. (7), we obtain
2nQ(n, ǫ) ≥S(RnR′n)ρ −S(BnWBRnR′n)ξ + S(BnWB)ξ −nδ(n, ǫ) −2nδ1(n, ǫ)
= I(BnWB : RnR′n)ξ −nδ(n, ǫ) −2nδ1(n, ǫ)
(8)
≥I(Bn : RnR′n)ξ −nδ(n, ǫ) −2nδ1(n, ǫ),
≥2na(ρ, ǫ) −nδ(n, ǫ) −2nδ1(n, ǫ),

where the third line follows from the data processing inequality. The last line follows from the deﬁnition of a(·, ǫ) and
its superadditivity Lemma 5. Dividing by 2n, Q∗≥a(ρ, ǫ) −1
2δ(n, ǫ) −δ1(n, ǫ). Taking the limit n →∞and ǫ →0
in either order, δ(n, ǫ) + δ1(n, ǫ) →0, so
Q∗≥lim
ǫ→0 a(ρ, ǫ)
= a(ρ, 0).
The last line follows from Lemma 5 point 4, i.e., the continuity of the function at ǫ = 0.

The entanglement-assisted simulation of an identity channel was already studied in [5], where the optimal rate was
found to be S(CQ)ω −1
2S(C)ω, (entropies are with respect to the Koashi-Imoto decomposition). Below, we show
that we can obtain this result as a corollary of Theorem 6.
Proposition 7. The optimal entanglement-assisted rate for the simulation of the identity channel id : A →A is equal
to a(ρAR, 0) = S(CQ)ω −1
2S(C)ω.
Proof. For N = id, the function at γ = 0 is
a(ρAR, 0) :=
min
Λ:A→A
1
2I(A : RR′)τ
s.t.
F(ρAR, τ AR) = 1.
Consider the KI-decomposition of ρAR only with systems CQ and its puriﬁcation
ωCNQR =
X
c
pc|c⟩⟨c|C ⊗ωQR
c
|ω⟩CQRR′C′
=
X
c
√pc |c⟩C ⊗|ωc⟩QRR′
⊗|c⟩C′
,

where R′C′ are purifying systems. Note that a(ωCQR, 0) = a(ρAR, 0) holds since there are CPTP maps in both
directions T : A →CQ and R : CQ →A, and applying CPTP maps only increases the ﬁdelity and lowers the mutual
information. So, we evaluate the function below
a(ωCQR, 0) :=
min
Λ:CQ→CQ
1
2I(CQ : RR′)τ
s.t.
F(ωCQR, τ CQR) = 1.
