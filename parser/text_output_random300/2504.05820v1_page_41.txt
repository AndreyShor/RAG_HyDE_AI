1.5. Proton-proton collisions
DIS is the simplest scattering process that can be used to study the structure of the nuclei.
However, for various experimental and theoretical reasons, such as reaching higher center of
mass energies or trying to probe Higgs boson production, physicist started to investigate also
hadron-hadron collisions. In particular, measurements from Tevatron and LHC, on p¯p and pp
scattering respectively, provide nowadays a vast amount of accurate data that can be described
through the pQCD and PDFs formalism. Thanks to their universality, we can relate PDFs to
the inclusive cross-section of double hadron scattering through a generalization of the DIS
factorization theorem (cf. Eq. (1.54)). In this case, the formula entails a convolution of the
process dependent partonic matrix element with two PDFs

Simple hadronic processes as single gauge boson production (often called Drell-Yan or DY) or
inclusive jet production can provide essential constraints on the flavor separation and or the
gluon PDF. Recently, also other hadronic processes like single-t, t¯t, and prompt photon have
been used during PDF fits, but their impact is not as competitive as DIS, jets and DY.
From the theoretical point of view, the computation of double hadronic cross-sections is more
demanding than the DIS case, and it is usually available only at NLO or NNLO in QCD. The
presence of multi particle phase space complicates further the calculations. Typically, fully
analytical computations are not feasible beyond NLO and thus Monte Carlo methods are used
to sample complex integrals.
Up to know, for technical limitations, PDF independent computations of hadronic observables
ˆσ, which are crucial in PDF fitting (see Section 2.1), are only available at NLO. Therefore, a
K-factors approximation it is used to grasp the NNLO effect. This is achieved by rescaling the
NLO cross-section as follows
