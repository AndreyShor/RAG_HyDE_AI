As we can see, the angle αξ shown in Figs.1(d)-(f) is
not always constant during the relaxation process; the
squeezing effect appears with the slope variation during
the time evolution. It is necessary to calculate an ap-
propriate linear combination of projections of the spin
angular momentum operators Iz and Iy. To introduce
a pair of angular momentum operators, we consider the
unitary vector u in a three-dimensional real space R3 (see
Tables 1 and 2 on page 7 in Ref. [42]) given by
u = (ux, uy, uz) = (cos φ sin ϑ, sin φ sin ϑ, cos ϑ) .
(19)
The projection of the spin operator vector considering
the unitary vector on the R3 space, is denoted by
Ip = uxIx + uyIy + uzIz.
(20)
In the squeezing formalism, the angle of squeezing αξ
must be appropriately characterized to match the geo-
metric arrangement on the yz plane and computed from
the physical meaning corresponding to the average values
and variance of angular momentum operators. If φ = π
2
and ϑ = αξ + π
2 , the unitary vector can be defined as
u = (0, cos αξ, −sin αξ) = (ux, uy, uz) ,
(21)
and substituting onto the expression of the angular mo-
mentum operator of Eq.(20)
Ip = Iy cos αξ −Iz sin αξ.
(22)
To introduce another spin angular momentum opera-
tor, compatible with the previous Ip, we define an or-
thogonal unitary vector also in yz plane
u⊥= (cos φ cos ϑ, sin φ cos ϑ, −sin ϑ) .
(23)
We assume the same values for the geometrical angle as
previously identified, φ = π
2 and ϑ = αξ + π
2 , such that
the unitary orthogonal vector reads
u⊥= (0, −sin αξ, −cos αξ) .
(24)
By considering similar vector properties, the other com-
patible spin angular momentum operator is obtained as
Im = −Iy sin αξ −Iz cos αξ.
(25)
Finally, the variance of both operators Ip and Im can
be computed using the linear combination of the angular
momentum operators Iy and Iz employing Eq.(20) and
(25)
∆Ip · ∆Im ≥1
2|⟨Ix⟩|.
(26)
The Heisenberg uncertainty has different behavior for
the variance of the pair of non-Cartesian angular momen-
tum operators, ∆Ip·∆Im. The same is true for the pair of
Cartesian angular momentum operators, ∆Iy ·∆Iz in the
time interval for the squeezing process. In Figs.2(a)-(b),
both quantities are pictorially represented by blue-square
and magenta-triangle symbols, respectively. The product
of each pair of variance introduces a unique physical in-
terpretation. The physical quantity associated with the
pair of Cartesian angular momentum operators demon-
strates greater sensitivity to the quantum coherences for
the Schr¨odinger’s cat state as shown by the magenta-
triangle symbols in Figs.2(a)-(b).

FIG. 2: (Color online) The dynamics of the Heisenberg un-
certainty relations, ∆Ip ·∆Im and ∆Iy ·∆Iz, are compared to
the average value of ⟨Ix⟩

I = 7/2. Figures (a) and (c) correspond to the spin-3/2, while
figures (b) and (d) correspond to the spin-7/2 system. In (a)

This enhanced sensitiv-
ity reveals a stronger violation of the inequality when
the Schr¨odinger’s cat state is generated.
As the sys-
tem evolves, the inequality gradually transits close to
an equality regime.
In contrast, the pair of non-
Cartesian angular momentum operators, represented by
blue-square symbols, exhibits sensitivity in capturing
the quantum correlations throughout the dynamics of
the spin system under scrutiny. This includes both the
squeezing effect and the generation of the Schr¨odinger’s
cat state. In particular, for the pairs of non-Cartesian
and Cartesian angular momentum operators, the inequal-
ities converge at early time, which corresponds to the
Schr¨odinger’s cat state generation.
Considering decoherence under relaxation, the deriva-
tive of the product of variances for the non-Cartesian
angular momentum operators (Figs.2(c) and 2(d)) is cal-
culated to investigate such behavior during the dynam-
ics. This approach enables the evaluation of the rate of
change between each pair of points. The results of this
analysis are presented in Figs.4(a) and (b), correspond-
