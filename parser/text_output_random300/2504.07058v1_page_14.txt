Theorem 2.5. Let 𝑈𝑛
0 ∈𝐻1
0(D) be the initial neural network approximation of the Burgess equation. Under the
assumptions of lemma Appendix E.5, there exists a unique solution 𝑢∈𝐻1(D) ∩𝐻2(D) to the Burgess equation.
Assume that the Burgess equation satisfies the Lipschitz condition given in Appendix E.6, and that the sequence {𝑈𝑛}
is uniformly bounded in 𝐿2([0,𝑇]; 𝐻1(D)). Then, the approximate solution 𝑈𝑛satisfies the following properties:
1. Strong convergence in 𝐿2: 𝑈𝑛→𝑢strongly in 𝐿2(D).
2. Uniform convergence: 𝑈𝑛converges uniformly to 𝑢in D.
Suppose 𝑈𝑛satisfies the PDE in a bounded domain D with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions:
𝜕𝑈𝑛
𝜕𝑡
= 1
2∆𝑈𝑛+ 𝑅(𝑈𝑛),
(2.77)
where the reaction term 𝑅(𝑈𝑛) satisfies one of the following conditions:
1. Linear Growth Condition:
|𝑅(𝑈𝑛)|⩽𝐶(1 + |𝑈𝑛|),
for some constant 𝐶> 0.
(2.78)
Under this condition, there exists a constant 𝑀> 0 such that:
sup
𝑡∈[0,𝑇]
∥𝑈𝑛(𝑡)∥𝐿2(D)⩽𝑀.
(2.79)
2. Exponential decay condition:
|𝑅(𝑈𝑛)|⩽𝐶𝑒−𝜆|𝑈𝑛|,
for some constants 𝐶> 0, 𝜆> 0.
(2.80)
In this case, 𝑈𝑛exhibits moderate decay properties, ensuring:
• Boundedness in 𝐿2(D),
Under the above assumptions, the sequences {𝑈𝑛} and {∆𝑈𝑛} remain uniformly bounded in 𝐿2(D) and 𝐻2(D),
respectively.
Proof. To prove that the sequence {𝑈𝑛} is uniformly bounded in 𝐿2(D), we use energy estimates. The sequence
𝑈𝑛satisfies the PDE:
𝜕𝑈𝑛
𝜕𝑡
= 1
2∆𝑈𝑛+ 𝑅(𝑈𝑛),
(2.81)
in a bounded domain D with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Taking the 𝐿2(D)-inner product with
𝑈𝑛, we obtain:
 𝜕𝑈𝑛
𝜕𝑡,𝑈𝑛

 1
2∆𝑈𝑛,𝑈𝑛

𝑅(𝑈𝑛),𝑈𝑛
.
(2.82)
Using integration by parts and the boundary condition 𝑈𝑛= 0 on 𝜕D, we get:

∆𝑈𝑛,𝑈𝑛
= −∥∇𝑈𝑛∥2
𝐿2(D).
(2.83)
Thus, the equation simplifies to:
𝑑
𝑑𝑡∥𝑈𝑛∥2
𝐿2(D)= −∥∇𝑈𝑛∥2
𝐿2(D)+2

𝑅(𝑈𝑛),𝑈𝑛

Bounding the Reaction Term We consider the two different reaction term conditions. Linear Growth Condition
|𝑅(𝑈𝑛)|⩽𝐶(1 + |𝑈𝑛|).
(2.85)
Applying H¨older’s inequality:

𝑅(𝑈𝑛),𝑈𝑛

Using Young’s inequality, for some constant 𝐶1:
∥𝑈𝑛∥𝐿2(D)⩽1
