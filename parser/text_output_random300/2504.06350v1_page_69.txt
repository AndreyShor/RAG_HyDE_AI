quadrature amplitude modulations were mutually entangled, and CV equivalent of the BBM92 protocol
for discrete variables was implemented. This scheme is secure against memory-free attacks performed on
Bob’s untrusted detector, that is, attacks that are independent of Bob’s previous measurement, and secure
against Trojan-horse attacks on the source that usually threaten electro-optical modulators commonly
used in Gaussian-modulation QKD protocols. A hybrid scheme where Alice uses a Gaussian-modulated
coherent state while Bob uses a two-mode squeezed state was studied in [440].
A 1SDI-QKD protocol using high-dimensional time-energy entanglement was proposed in Ref. [441].
The security of this scheme was established by applying the entropic uncertainty relation introduced in
[442] against coherent attacks. Their numerical results demonstrate that the protocol achieves higher
bit rates per two-photon coincidence count while requiring lower detection efficiencies compared to the
original 1SDI-QKD protocol (achieving a key rate with ηA = 50%). This improvement stems from the
limitation imposed by photon information efficiency in the original 1SDI-QKD protocol, which restricted
the key generation rate to no more than 1 bit per coincidence. Encoding information in high-dimensional
photonic degrees of freedom proves to be an efficient approach for overcoming this limitation.
5.5.2. Generalized 1SDI-QKD and Quantum Secret Sharing
In 2017, Kogias et.al. [443] tackled the problem by considering the protocol as a generalized 1SDI-
QKD problem for a continuous-variable version of QSS [444].
They started with the simplest case
involving three parties, Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice is fully trusted and shares the secret using a
three-mode continuous-variable entangled-state. She keeps one mode and sends the other modes to the
untrusted players, Bob and Charlie, through individual unknown quantum channels. In this way, the
protocol can be seen as a generalized 1SDI-QKD protocol from Alice (trusted part) to Bob and Charlie as
untrusted players. Alice is assumed to perform two homodyne measurements of two canonically conjugate
quadratures ˆx and ˆp, and her goal is to establish a unique secret key, not with Bob’s or Charlie’s individual
measurements (as in standard two-party QKD), but with a collective (nonlocal) degree of freedom for
Bob and Charlie that strongly correlates with one of Alice’s quadratures (XA for example). Alice sends
a sufficient number of states to the players and in each run, they randomly choose measurements and
measure their parts, and collect the outcomes Xi and Pi. In the next step, all parties announce their
measurements and keep the data originating from correlated measurements, using it for extracting a
secret key.
The final bound on the asymptotic key rate to provide unconditional security against general attacks
of an eavesdropper, and against arbitrary (individual) cheating methods of both Bob and Charlie, which
include the announcement of faked measurements and general attacks of Bob on Charlie’s system and of
Charlie on Bob’s system, can be written as
r ≥−log(e

where

(177)
and ¯X is Bob and Charlie’s collective degree of freedom that strongly correlated with Alice’s quadrature
XA.
While the resource behind the standard 1SDI-QKD is known to be (bipartite) steering, one could
suspect a similar connection with the case of multi-player QSS, which is indeed the case for the case of
Gaussian measurements [445]. For a generic Gaussian (n + m)-mode state ρAB of a bipartite system,
composed of a subsystem A (for Alice) of n modes and a subsystem B (for Bob) of m modes, one can
define a steering measure as [446]
GA→B(σAB) = max

is the covariant matrix of the state ρAB 16. This measure has an operational
meaning in 1SDI-QKD. For a two-mode entangled Gaussian state with covariance matrix σAB, the key
rate can be readily expressed in terms of the B →A Gaussian steerability of σAB [439], yielding
r ≥max{0, GB→A + ln 2 −1}.
