interpretation of the results shown in the main text. Specifically, the equations below are
used in the discussion section of the main text.
A different treatment for the complex
permittivity of TLS is introduced in Refs. [13, 14]. According to the standard tunneling
model (STM), the dielectric loss due to TLS can be written as
Im(ϵTLS)(T, f) = δTLS tanh
 hf
2kBT

.
(18)
Under high driving powers, considering the saturation of TLS, this expression is modified
to [2, 12]
Im(ϵTLS)(T, f, Pmw) = δTLS tanh
 hf
2kBT

where Pmw is the input microwave power, ⟨ncav⟩(which is proportional to Pmw) is the average
number of photons in the resonator, nc is the critical photon number determined by the
relaxation and decoherence times of the TLS and their coupling to the resonator, and β is
an empirical fitting parameter used to reproduce experimental observations [10]. In addition,
δTLS is typically expressed as [2, 12, 14]
δTLS = πρTLSd2
0
3ϵhost
,
(20)
where ρTLS is the density of states of TLS, d0 is the dipole moment of TLS, and ϵhost
is the permittivity of the host material.
This relation indicates that an increase in the
number of TLS near the resonance frequency leads to an enhanced density of states ρTLS,
resulting in increased resonator loss.
Thus, as discussed in the main text, the relation,
∆(1/Q) ∝δTLS ∝ρTLS, holds. Typically, the frequency dependence of ρTLS is assumed to
be negligible. Additionally, according to eqs. (15) and (20),
∆fr(T)
fr
∝δTLS ∝ρTLS,
(21)
indicating that the rise in the TLS density increases ∆fr(T)/fr, as is also discussed in the
main text.
The real part of the permittivity is obtained from the Kramers–Kronig relation as follows:
Re(ϵTLS)(T, f) = 1 + 2
π P

df ′ f ′ ϵ′′(f ′)
f ′2 −f 2,
(22)
where P denotes that the integral is taken as the Cauchy principal value. By evaluating the
integral, Eq. (15) is obtained. Note that, since the integral is weighted by the factor f ′2−f 2,
variations in ϵTLS(f ′) near the resonance frequency predominantly determine Re(ϵTLS)(T, f).
