FIG. 1: AGP suppression of non-adiabatic transitions. The color map represents the occupation probability of the
excited state |1⟩(P0→1) across different parameter sweep rates dλ/dt (vertical axis) and evolution time (horizontal
axis). The anti-adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) effectively suppresses transitions even at high sweep rates (dλ/dt ≫
1), as evidenced by the persistent dark-blue regions (P0→1 ≈0). The suppression robustness stems from the geometric
counter-diabatic term cancelling non-adiabatic excitations. All quantities are in dimensionless units (a.u.).
FIG. 2: Evolution diagrams of parameter values and parameter paths over time. The left figure shows the variation
of the introduced nonlinear parameters over time, while the right figure illustrates the relationship between the two
parameters and their evolution paths. By adjusting the modulation parameter values, the actual evolution path can
bypass intermediate excited states, making it equivalent to the direct transition from the ground state to the Rydberg
state. Consequently, the system regains its quasi-topological properties.
