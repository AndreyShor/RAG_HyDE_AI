FIG. 1. r vs. ns (upper left panel), r vs. ξ (upper right), ξ vs. ns (lower left) and λ vs. ξ (lower right) for N = 50 e-folds
in the metric (continuous) and Palatini formulation (dashed), with δ = 0.1%, δ = 1% and δ = 3% in the loop corrected
Higgs-inflation-like scenario. The gray (purple) areas represent the 1,2σ allowed regions coming from the latest combination
of Planck, BICEP/Keck and BAO data [9] (from Planck, ACT, and DESI [8]). For reference, we also plot the predictions of
quartic (brown), quadratic (orange), linear (green) and Starobinsky [2] (black) inflation in metric gravity, and, in the right
lower panel, λew ≃0.13 (gray dashed line), i.e., the value of the Higgs-self quartic coupling at EW scale. The arrow in the
upper left panel denotes the direction of increasing ξ.
δ is very small (in our case 0.1%), the strong coupling pre-
dictions are very close to the ones of the corresponding
tree-level limit, i.e., Starobinsky inflation. By increasing
δ, we depart more and more from the Starobinsky limit,
towards higher values of both r and ns. At N = 50, 60,
the predictions enter the 1σ allowed region by [8] when
δ = 3%, while at N = 60, this is also possible for δ = 1%.
Finally, we note that this time, the strong coupling linear
inflation limit [18] is not reached in the metric case but
only in the Palatini formulation. This happens because
we considered smaller values of δ with respect to the ones
used in [18], and because in the metric case we stopped
the analysis around ξ ∼104, corresponding to λ ∼1,
which we consider a naive upper bound to ensure the
perturbativity of the theory. Let us now discuss the pre-
dictions in the Palatini formulation. When ξ is small, the
results are undistinguishable from the ones of the metric
case, until 0.01 ≲ξ ≲0.1, where the results of the met-
ric and Palatini formulation start to be visibly displaced,
according to the exact value of δ: the smaller δ, the more
visible the difference. For ξ ≳0.1, the predictions easily
enter the 1σ allowed region of ACT [8].
It is worth noting that the result mitigates the issue of
perturbative unitarity violation (at the scale Λ = MP /ξ
in metric gravity [23] and Λ = MP /√ξ in Palatini grav-
ity [24]), which is a common concern in non-minimally
coupled models. In both gravity formulations, it is pos-
sible to enter the ACT 2σ allowed region for ξ ≲1, im-
plying that this scale is pushed well above the inflation-
ary regime and even above the Planck scale, where an
appropriate UV completion of our theory is inevitably
required.
We stress that in this analysis, we have been agnostic
about the details of the underlying UV theory and the
nature of the inflaton scalar. However, if we identify the
inflaton with the standard model Higgs boson, then our
