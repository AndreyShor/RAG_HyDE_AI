object profile. Proximal objects X, Y require |φ(x ∈X) −φ(y ∈Y )| ∈[0, 1] . All
characteristic vectors (aka eigenvectors) emanate from the same fixed point in C,
namely, 0. Stable characteristic vector fields satisfy the Krantz stability condition,
namely, all eigenvalues lie inside the unit circle in C.
An application of the proposed approach is given in measuring system stability
in terms of vector fields emanating from oscillatory waveforms derived from the
up-and-down movements of a walker, runner or biker recorded in a sequence of
infrared video frames. We prove that system stability occurs when its maximum
eigenvalue occurs within or on the boundary of the unit circle in complex plane
(See Theorem 1). This result extends results in [20], [7]) as well as in [16, 13, 3].

2. Preliminaries
Detected affinities between vector fields for stable systems results from determining
the infimum of the distances between pairs of system characteristics.
