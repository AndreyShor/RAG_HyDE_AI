FIG. 2.
Left panel. The symbols are the average full system R´enyi-2 asymmetry in a window of mid-spectrum eigenvectors
of the Hamiltonian (2) centered at ε = 0 (we take 46, 68, 100, 200 states for L = 8, 10, 12, 14, respectively) as a function of
the angle θ defining the charge Qθ ≡cos θ Qz + sin θ Qx for which the asymmetry is computed. This family of charges are
represented by the red arc in the inset sphere. The errorbars are the standard deviation of the asymmetry over the chosen
sample of eigenstates. Independently on L, the asymmetry shows a minimum at a value of θ very close to θ∗= arctan(g/h),
as highlighted by the red dashed line. The black dash-dotted lines are the analytical prediction (7) for E[∆S(2)
L ] for a charge
orthogonal to the one conserved in the U(1)-symmetric random state ensemble in the sector M = L/2. The numerical data
are compatible for all the L considered with this analytical result for the angle θ∗+ π/2. Right panel. Same analysis but for
charges belonging to the arc connecting Qθ∗and Qy (red curve in the sphere inset). The maximum is reached at φ ≈π/2 and
is again compatible with the prediction (7) for the symmetric random states with M = L/2.
where σx,y,z
j
are the Pauli matrices acting on the j-th site.
We take a chain with L sites and open boundary condi-
tions. Following Ref. [31, 32], we include two boundary
fields h1σz
1, hLσz
L to break the inversion symmetry un-
der the spatial reflection of the chain. In this way, the
Hamiltonian does not possess any symmetry, and when
the couplings are both O(1), the model is far enough away
from any possible integrability regime. More specifically,
from now on we set g = 1.1 and h = 0.35. These values
belong to a commonly used range of parameters in the lit-
erature to study quantum chaos [73–75] and they exactly
correspond to the most chaotic point of the model (2) in
the sense discussed in [32].
We now make explicit the connection between the en-
ergy of the eigenstates of this model and the charge of
U(1)-symmetric random states. Observe that the only
requirement of the charge Q that generates the symme-
try is to be local, in the sense that, for any bipartition,
Q = QA + QB.
Under this assumption, we can con-
sider, without loss of generality, a charge that takes val-
ues 0 or 1 at each spin. In that case, the charge density
s ≡M/L, defined in the interval 0 ≤s ≤1, can be iden-
tified with the energy density ε ≡E/L of the eigenstates
of H by [31]
ε/ε∗= 2s −1,
(3)
such that the charge sector with largest degeneracy, s =
1/2, corresponds to the zero energy density, ε = 0. The
rescaling factor ε∗is determined by the scale of the energy
fluctuations, ε∗=
p
⟨H2⟩/L.
At finite-size, Ref. [76]
showed that the density of states peaks around an energy
Ep ̸= 0 that tends to zero when L →∞. For this reason,
we prefer to estimate Ep and ε∗by fitting the density of
states obtained numerically by exactly diagonalizing (2).
We then consider as rescaled energy density ε/ε∗= (E −
Ep)/(L ε∗).
However, we have not provided a specific expression for
the conserved charge in the ensemble of U(1)-symmetric
random states. In our particular example, it should cor-
respond to the approximate global U(1)-symmetry in-
duced by energy conservation and the locality of the in-
teractions in the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (2). To
further understand and identify the explicit form of the
charge that generates this effective symmetry, a conve-
nient tool is the entanglement asymmetry.
Entanglement asymmetry.— The entanglement asym-
metry quantifies the extent to which a symmetry trans-
formation generated by a charge QA is broken within
a subsystem A.
Its definition requires the introduc-
tion of the symmetrized reduced density matrix ρA,Q =
P
q ΠqρAΠq, where Πq is projector on the eigenspace of
QA corresponding to the eigenvalue q. The R´enyi-n en-
tanglement asymmetry is then defined as the difference
between the R´enyi-n entropies Sn(ρ) =
1
1−n log Tr[ρn] of
