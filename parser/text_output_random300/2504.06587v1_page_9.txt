and retains a notable gap from the reference even at 𝑟> 1. While
DCS performs adequately on random Gaussian signals, it strug-
gles with over-the-air signals. For noise-free random Gaussian
signals shown in Figure 14, DCS fails in faithful spectrum recovery,
and only SigChord achieves perfect recovery due to its rule-based
Transformer design, as shown in Figure 14. At 𝑟≈0.5, SigChord ’s
performance declines due to the loss of the full column rank of 𝐴𝑆
in Algorithm 1, consistent with the Landau rate. The drop occurs
earlier for over-the-air signals since they do not fully occupy each
sub-band, causing the full-rank transition (𝑃= |𝑆|) to occur at an 𝑟
slightly above 0.5.
During the inference phase, we set the batch size to 1,024. For
𝑃= 8, the spectrum sensing module processes one batch in 17.0 ±
0.33ms, corresponding to an average per-sample processing time
of 16.6 𝜇s. Meanwhile, the remaining part of Algorithm 1 takes 29.1
± 4.0 ms to recover these signals, resulting in an average recovery
time of 28.42 𝜇s. For random Gaussian signals containing eight
narrowband signals, the recovery phase requires 31.7 ± 4.0 ms
per batch, averaging 30.96 𝜇s per sample. The recovery speed is
significantly faster than DTMP and DCS, which require seconds to
recover signals. Given that the duration of each multiband signal is
48 𝜇s, the spectrum sensing and recovery modules in SigChord can
achieve real-time performance using a consumer-level GPU.

Protocol Identification
This section evaluates the protocol identification performance of
SigChord, comparing it with the Transformer-based SOTA model
T-Prime [66]. For both SigChord and T-Prime, signals are recovered
by Algorithm 1 assuming accurate spectrum sensing. T-Prime is
an encoder-only model designed for signal classification. Unlike
SigChord, it does not apply a specialized embedding process to
the input signal, using only a simple reshaping operation instead.
T-Prime flattens all output tokens from the encoders and feeds
them into a fully connected layer for classification. We implement
T-Prime with 3 encoder layers, 𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙= 64, 8 attention heads, and
a feedforward dimension of 1,024. The sequence length is thus 75,
same as SigChord with folding factor 𝐹= 32. We train T-Prime on
the synthetic dataset with a batch size of 128 for 300 epochs.
First, we compare the classification performance on the synthetic
dataset under varying SNR conditions, as shown in Figure 15. Here
and in Section. 5.3, we choose 𝑟= 0.625 and 𝑟= 0.83, representing
situations with mild recovery errors and near-Nyquist optimal re-
covery as shown in Figure 13, respectively. Although T-Prime has
more parameters, SigChord consistently achieves superior perfor-
mance across all SNR levels. At an extremely low sampling rate
of 𝑟= 0.625, both models show performance degradation due to
increased recovery errors as shown in Figure 13a, but SigChord
demonstrates approximately a 2dB performance gain over T-Prime,
achieving over 90% accuracy at an SNR of 6dB.
Figure 16 shows the classification confusion matrices on the syn-
thetic dataset at an SNR of 10dB. At 𝑟= 0.625, both models effec-
tively distinguish Wi-Fi headers from DVB-S2. They show slightly
lower accuracy in differentiating more similar non-HT and HT
Wi-Fi formats. SigChord outperforms T-Prime by 1.4% for DVB-S2,
2.1% for non-HT Wi-Fi, 3.1% for HT Wi-Fi, and 2.7% in recognizing
no-head frames. Both models struggle to distinguish DVB-S2 from
payloads (no-head) due to its short preamble in the header, which
provides limited distinctive features. The entire header spans only
4.5𝜇s, with just 1.3𝜇s for the SOF preamble. In contrast, Wi-Fi head-
ers (L-STF, L-LTF, HT-STF, HT-LTF) are at least 18 𝜇s long thus
have higher accuracies. At𝑟= 0.83, both models perform accurately,
with SigChord exceeding 99.9% accuracy in all categories.
