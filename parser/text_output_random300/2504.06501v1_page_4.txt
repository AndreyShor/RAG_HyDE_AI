on elevation and azimuth angles. By writing the reflection coeffients
in this way, we account for the influence of anisotropic properties on
the overall scattering behavior. The weights a1 to a8 in this linear
system can be determined given measured or simulated data by using
various numerical methods such as the least mean square (LMS). In
this work, we exploit the symmetries in the unit cell (square lattice,
orthogonal anisotropy axes) and adopt simple intuitive φ-dependent
expressions for the weights, inspired by uniaxial anisotropic materials
[21], [22]
a1 = a8 ≈cos2 φ,
a2 = a7 ≈sin2 φ,
a3 = a5 ≈−cos φ sin φ,
a4 = a6 ≈+ cos φ sin φ.

These trigonometric expressions are not unique but, by only main-
taining the azimuth φ dependence, they provide an excellent balance
between simplicity and accuracy.
III. RESULTS
A. ECM Validation in Tunable Perfect Absorption
To demonstrate the validity of the developed ECM-TLM we will
use it to compute the reflection coefficient spectra in the case of
complex-valued RC loading. Then, we will use the model to compute
the series RC values and geometric dimensions required for perfect
absorption at given frequency, incidence angle, and polarization. The
ECM-TLM prediction is in all cases compared to FWS spectra, for
the same parameters, to validate its accuracy and range.
The 1 × 1 cell’s geometric dimensions are D(1×1) = 6.5mm, s =
0.7mm, h = 2.2mm and εr = 2.2(1 −j0.0009), wLFE = 0.5mm.
The 2 × 1 and 2 × 2 cell’s geometric dimensions are D(2×2) =
6.8mm, s = 0.7mm, h = 2.2mm and εr = 2.2(1 −j0.0009),
wLFE = 0.5mm. In all of the cases the target operational frequency
is set to 5.5 GHz. Naturally, all unit cell designs can be scaled-down
for operation at higher frequencies, i.e., in the microwave X-band
10 GHz or millimeter wave band 28 GHz.
We start by showing indicative reflection spectra of the 1×1 cell in
Fig. 3 when only the series resistance or only the series capacitance
in the lumped load is changed: the former strongly affects the Q-
factor and the latter the resonance frequency, respectively. Note the
excellent agreement between the ECM-TLM and the FWS.
We then use the ECM-TLM and FWS to compute the series RC
loads required for perfect absorption (reflection magnitude lower
than −50 dB), as the oblique incidence angle θ varies in both
polarization planes, in Fig. 4. We note different trends for TE and
TM polarizations and the good agreement for angles up to 70◦(45◦)
for the 1 × 1 (2 × 1) cell.
Finally, we use the ECM-TLM and FWS to compute the series
RC loads required for perfect absorption as the frequency is varied

in Fig. 5. We note the good agreement for deviations up to ±10%
of the central frequency.
B. ECM validation for Arbitrary Plane of Incidence
To demonstrate that the developed ECM-TLM can be used to
compute the co- and cross-polarized reflection spectra under an
arbitrary plane of incidence (φ), oblique incidence (θ), and different
loading in the two axes. The spectra for two arbitrarily chosen
incident plane wave directions (θ, φ) are shown in Fig. 6. The
comparison between the approximate model (dashed curves) and the
FWS (solid curves) is agreeable for all four scattering parameters,
while the numerically optimized LMS (dash-dot curves) using FWS-
fitted a1→8 weights is also shown. The minor discrepancy Rsp ̸= Rps
in the model is due to not explicitly enforcing reciprocity in the
case of arbitrary incidence plane; note that the case of TM polarized
oblique incidence on a uniaxially anisotropic medium is a known
‘incomplete’ problem, i.e., one cannot fully decompose the E-field in
two perpendicular planes.
C. Polarization Manipulation
Metasurfaces enable polarization control by tuning resistance and
capacitance along the two rectangular axes of anisotropy, i.e., ad-
justing the phase difference and relative magnitude of orthogonally
polarized components. Using ECMs, we analyze square patches
optimized at φ = 45◦and normal incidence, where both axes are
equally illuminated. Two functionalities are studied: linear-to-circular
conversion and linear-to-orthogonal transformation. In both cases, we
employ only phase manipulation, i.e., Rx = Ry = 0. The selected
structure is the 2 × 2 cell configuration for operational frequency of
5.5 GHz.
For the transformation from linear to circular polarization in
reflection, we need to implement a quarter-wave plate, i.e., the phase
difference between the co- and cross-polarized reflection coefficients
must be ±90◦and their amplitudes must be equal, resulting in an
axial ratio (AR) equal to 0 dB. Using our ECM, we computed that
these conditions are met when Cx ≈2.51 pF and Cy ≈0.45 pF. For
ideal linear cross-polarization conversion, we need to implement a
half-wave plate, i.e., the goal is to achieve |Rss| = 0 and |Rps| = 1;
in practice a magnitude ratio of ±20 dB denotes almost perfect
conversion. The ECM-computed capacitance values for this condition
at 5.5 GHz are Cx ≈1, 23 pF and Cy ≈0.13 pF.
In Fig. 7, we compare the ECM-predicted spectra with the
FWS-computed ones, using the same capacitance values. For cross-
polarized reflection, it is evident that at 5.5GHz, |Rss| ≈0.065
and |Rps| ≈0.99, indicating strong polarization conversion. Further
