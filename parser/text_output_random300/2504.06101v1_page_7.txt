a more detailed discussion of the calculation is given in
Appendix C. We find that the energy spectra shown in
Figs. 5(a) and 5(c) [Fig. 5(b)] exhibit 2 gapless states [4
gapless states], while all other states are gapped out. In
Figs. 5(d)–5(f), we verify that the gapless states are in-
deed localized to the hinges of the sample. For this, we
choose the lowest-energy point on each branch and cal-
culate the projections of the probability density of these
points on the corresponding planes. Here, hinge states
propagating to the right (left) with respect to the corre-
sponding coordinate axis are shown in blue (orange). By
inspection of Figs. 5(d)–5(f), we can again verify that
right and left movers propagate along a closed path of
hinges in accordance with Fig. 3(a). Note that the sizes
of the energy gaps and localization lengths differ between
the different panels due to the different tunneling pro-
cesses that gap out the corresponding surfaces.
B.
Multiple gapless hinge states
The results obtained in the previous subsection III A
can be generalized to the multi-state regime character-
ized by l gapless hinge states propagating in the same
direction and localized to the same hinges of the sample
(here l is a positive integer). Below, we consider only the
case l = 2, and the generalization to l > 2 is discussed in
Appendix D.
We start by finding the hinge states propagating along
the x axis. For this, we again set the system to be infinite
along the x direction and apply a multi-step perturbation
procedure. First, we take into account the Zeeman term
H(l)
B and the tunneling along the y axis term H(l)
y , given
by Eqs. (4) and (5) with l = 2, as these terms are assumed
to be dominant in our parameter hierarchy. Without the
tunneling processes along the z direction, the system is
again nothing but a stack of 2D QAH insulators lying in
the xy planes [26]. The effective coupling between right
and left movers in these planes is a result of two subse-
quent tunneling events determined in leading order of the
perturbation theory with strength ∝∆Bty/µ, see Fig. 6.
As a result, the bulk and the xy surfaces of the sample
become fully gapped. However, the system exhibits gap-
less states located on the xz surfaces, namely two left
movers Ln11¯1σ (LnNy¯11σ) and two right movers RnNy11σ
(Rn1¯1¯1σ), all with σ ∈{1, ¯1}, in each 2D QAH layer at
τ = 1 (τ = ¯1).
To couple the remaining gapless states but leave 2l
chiral hinge states uncoupled, we need to slightly mod-
ify the tunneling processes along the z direction. The
new tunneling terms take the same form as Eqs. (6) and
(7) with the only difference that the tunneling ampli-
tudes do not depend on l. Instead they are now given by
tzν(x) = 2tzν cos (2kF x) and ˜tzν(x) = 2˜tzν cos (2kF x).
These terms gap out the xz surfaces but leave l = 2
gapless right-moving states R1Ny11¯1, R1Ny111 in the unit
cell (n, m) = (1, Ny), and two gapless left-moving states
LNzNy¯11¯1, LNzNy¯111 in the unit cell (Nz, Ny). These chi-

FIG. 6. Sketch of four unit cells of the system with l = 2.
The notations are the same as in Fig. 2. The magnetic and
interwire terms in leading order of the perturbation theory
open gaps in the bulk and surfaces but leave four gapless hinge
states: two right movers at (n, m, τ, ν) = (1, Ny, 1, 1), and two
left movers at (Nz, Ny, ¯1, 1). Gapless states are denoted by
red ovals.
ral hinge states are denoted by red ovals in Fig. 6. Note
that in the case of a finite 3D sample, the hinge states
propagating along the y and z directions can be found in
the same way as it was done for l = 1.
IV.
FRACTIONAL CHIRAL HINGE STATES
In this section, we show that the coupled-wires model
introduced in Sec. II can also realize fractional SOTI
phases with gapless chiral hinge states that carry only
a fraction of the electronic charge e. For this, we set the
parameter l equal to 1/p, with p being a positive odd
integer. In this configuration, the direct tunneling be-
tween right and left movers is suppressed due to momen-
tum mismatch. However, we can introduce momentum-
conserving tunneling terms by including backscattering
terms due to strong electron-electron interactions.
In
the leading order that conserves momentum, the Zeeman
term is modified as

The corresponding coupling amplitude is given by gB ∝

Similarly,
we assume that tunneling processes between neighboring
wires are accompanied by q simultaneous backscattering
processes in each wire [19, 20], such that the interwire
