Appendix A 
 Reaction Sub-chain Equations 
 
To calculate the yields for the entire lanthanide or actinide r-process or s-process would require a 
coupled system of some 765 differential equations. In order to work with a more tractable 
reaction chain that still captures the overall pattern we select sub-chains that focus on a 
representative sample of each process of interest. The resulting systems used in each figure for 
each process are given below along with the requisite seed nuclei to start the chain form the 
stellar core.  
 
The notation for the rate values is given as:
