instability of solitons arising from an elliptical dark stripe
(Ferreira et al., 2024b) or perturbation by a moving ob-
stacle (Azam et al., 2022). The observation of vortex an-
nihilation, often accompanied by radiative losses, offers
crucial insights into non-equilibrium dynamics. Recent
research has focused on topological constraints govern-
ing vortex formation, highlighting the role of initial den-
sity and velocity distributions in determining nucleation
pathways (Congy et al., 2024).
Specifically, vortex-antivortex pairs emerge from phase
extrema (node collisions), while phase saddles contribute
to vortex annihilation.
The node collision mechanism
is particularly effective in compressible, non-stationary
light-fluid flows.
A recent experiment has evidenced
Jones-Roberts solitons (JRS). This provides a direct link
between soliton dynamics and vortex formation, since
this structure experiences a transition from a vortex-
antivortex dipole to a rarefaction pulse (Baker-Rasooli
et al., 2025). This illustrates a coherent mechanism for
vortex annihilation, where incompressible vortex flow is
converted into compressible wave excitations.
As the number of vortices in the system increases, the
study naturally extends to turbulence in quantum fluids
of light (Alperin et al., 2019; Barenghi et al., 2014; Pan-
ico et al., 2023). Turbulence, a highly non-equilibrium
regime characterized by energy transfer across multiple
length scales, remains an open challenge in fluid physics.
Fluids of light provide a unique platform for investigating
this phenomenon due to the precise control over initial
conditions and direct access to phase information (Eloy
et al., 2021).
Recent studies have examined the creation and annihi-
lation of vortex-antivortex pairs, as well as the role of hy-
drodynamic instabilities such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz in-
stability in triggering turbulence (Ferreira et al., 2024a).
In counter-propagating geometries, where two fluids of
light collide, kinetic energy spectrum analysis reveals
characteristic power laws, including the inverse energy
cascade with a k−5/3 scaling (Baker-Rasooli et al., 2023).
Advances in numerical techniques now enable higher-
resolution energy spectra, allowing turbulence dynamics
to be explored across a broader range of length scales
(Bradley et al., 2022).
Furthermore, the study of quantum-like turbulence has
been extended to two-component paraxial fluids of light,
where orthogonally polarized components interact. This
setup enables the observation of both direct and inverse
turbulent cascades, with tunable properties controlled by
the relative angle of incidence between the components
(Silva et al., 2021). These investigations pave the way for
a deeper understanding of turbulence in quantum fluids
and its underlying mechanisms.

(or a moving fluid).
The defect is imprinted using a local
modification of the refractive index (constant along z). The
relative velocity is given by the angle between the fluid beam
and the defect.

impurity of finite size and finite mass in a fluid of light. Ex-
perimental data are taken in rubidium vapor. From left to

Hydrodynamics in quantum fluids directly leads to the
study of superfluidity.
Superfluidity is the frictionless
flow of a fluid below a critical velocity and it is one of
the most striking manifestations of macroscopic quan-
tum physics. Fluids of light have provided a novel ex-
perimental platform for studying various aspects of this
phenomenon.
Pioneering experiments have revealed indirect signa-
tures of superfluidity, notably through the measurement
of the Bogoliubov dispersion relation for elementary exci-
tations (Fontaine et al., 2018; Piekarski et al., 2021; Vocke
et al., 2015). This dispersion exhibits a linear (phononic)
regime at low wave vectors (Fontaine et al., 2020) and
a quadratic (particule-like) regime at high wave vectors,
mirroring the behavior of atomic superfluids or liquid he-
lium, as described in Section II.E. Observations of the
Bogoliubov dispersion have been reported in both local
(Fontaine et al., 2018) and non-local light fluids (Vocke
et al., 2015).
Beyond these indirect signatures, direct evidence of su-
perfluidity in light has also been obtained. Experiments
have demonstrated dissipation-less flow around obstacles
below a critical velocity, a hallmark of superfluidity, as
the fluid overcomes imperfections without energy loss
(Amo et al., 2009a; Ferreira et al., 2024b, 2018). The
suppression of the drag force on a slowly moving defect
further reinforces this interpretation (Michel et al., 2018).
At supersonic velocities, the nucleation of quantized vor-
tices has been extensively studied, with investigations
characterizing their core size, circulation, and role in the
breakdown of superfluidity (Aladjidi, 2023).
Moreover, the study of superfluidity in rotating system
(Silva et al., 2017) could draw analogy with astrophysical
phenomena, such as rotating black holes (Marino et al.,
