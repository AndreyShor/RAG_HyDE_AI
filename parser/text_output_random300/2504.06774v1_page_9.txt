Modal Decomposition Techniques
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a fundamental matrix factorization technique
extensively used in numerical analysis, machine learning, and data-driven reduced-order
modeling. SVD decomposes a given snapshot matrix V K
1 (representing spatio-temporal
data) into three components: spatial modes U, singular values Σ, and temporal modes
T ⊤. The decomposition is expressed as [1]:
V K
1 = U Σ T ⊤,
(3)
Where:
• V K
1 is the J × K snapshot matrix, where J = Tvar · Nx · Ny · Nz is the total number
of spatial degrees of freedom, and K is the number of temporal snapshots,
• U is the J × J orthogonal matrix of spatial modes,
• Σ is the J × K diagonal matrix of singular values, arranged in decreasing order,
representing the energy associated with each mode,
• T ⊤is the K × K orthogonal matrix of temporal modes, where T ⊤denotes the
transpose of the temporal modes matrix.
The singular values σi in Σ represent the importance of each corresponding mode in
describing the energy or variance of the data. Larger singular values correspond to modes
that capture more significant features of the dataset. These singular values are arranged
in descending order within the diagonal matrix Σ. To select the most dominant modes
while filtering out less significant ones, a subset of N dominant modes is chosen such that
[1]:
σN+1
σ1
≤ε,
(4)
Where σ1 is the largest singular value, σN+1 is the first excluded singular value, and ε
is a user-defined tolerance controlling the energy threshold or significance of the retained
modes.
Using the dominant singular values and the corresponding spatial and temporal modes,
the snapshot matrix V K
1 can be approximated as [1]:
V K
1 ≃U N ΣN T ⊤
N,
(5)
where U N contains the first N spatial modes, ΣN contains the most significant singular
values, and T ⊤
N contains the corresponding temporal modes.
