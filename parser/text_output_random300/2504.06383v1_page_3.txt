In this Letter, we demonstrate the controlled excitation of whistler-mode waves via tem-
perature anisotropy instabilities in a set of stable and highly reproducible experiments,
capturing key features of their periodic dynamics in parameter regimes characteristic of near-
Earth space. First, our experiments generate whistler waves at a fraction of the electron
gyrofrequency using temperature-anisotropic electrons in a magnetic mirror, with dimen-
sionless parameters closely mimicking those in the inner magnetosphere. Second, similar to
the continuous injection of energetic electrons from the plasma sheet into the inner magneto-

(a) Schematic side view of the experimental setup (not to scale). The mirror section is
about 3.5 m. The reference location z = 0 is at the equator of the magnetic mirror. The B-dot
probe is positioned outside of the mirror at z = 3.2 m. (b) Schematic view of the z = 0 plane.
(c) Two Experimental timing schemes: In EXP-A, each shot lasts 200 µs with measurements
taken at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 13 ms after microwave pulse initiation. In EXP-B, the diagnostic operates
continuously for 10 ms.
