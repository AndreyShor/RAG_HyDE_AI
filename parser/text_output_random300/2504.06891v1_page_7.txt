Reconstruction of the solar seismic structure and seismic opacity determi-
nations
Our solar models are computed using the Li`ege stellar evolution code with the abundances of
Asplund et al. (2009)16 (hereafter AGSS09); some, like model 8, include the recent neon abun-
dance revision29;30 (hereafter AAG21) and one, model 7, uses abundances of the 1990’s from
Grevesse % Noels (1993)52 (hereafter GN93) whereas model 10 uses the recent abundances31
from averaged 3D atmosphere models (hereafter MB22). The properties of the set of calibrated
evolutionary models are listed in Table 1, additional information is provided in the Methods
section, subsection Solar evolutionary models and macroscopic transport of chemical elements.
First, we focus on Models 1 and 2 for the detailed analysis whereas the other models are used
in the Methods section to determine whether the observed trends in the seismic opacity pro-
ﬁle remain observable for other sets of physical ingredients. All models include microscopic
diffusion without the effects of radiative accelerations, as in Buldgen et al. (2019)53, as these
have been shown54 to only have a limited impact in the solar case, which would even further
be reduced by the effects of macroscopic mixing. Here, Model 7 is essentially a SSM from
the 1990’s, while we always include the latest physical prescription for macroscopic transport
at the BCZ from hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic instabilities32 in other models (us-
ing an asymptotic form described in the Methods). We also include adiabatic overshoot at the
BCZ so that rcz, the location of the base of convective envelope, is located at the helioseismic
value. These evolutionary models serve as initial conditions for the procedure of Buldgen et al.
