FIG. 5. Josephson and vortex-line topological properties of the Dirac octet model. (a) Gap distribution of Andreev bound
states for a (100)-directional π-junction at kz = 0. Red dots in the figure mark the gap closing points, i.e., JT transitions.
(b-d) Spectra of mirror-indexed Wilson loop of Andreev bound states at µ = −0.4 (b), µ = 0 (c), and µ = 0.6 (d), respectively.
The positive (negative) mirror sector is labeled in red (blue). (e) CdGM spectrum for a vortex line along ˆz direction at kz = 0,
where the insets offer a Jz-labeled zoom-in dispersions of the CdGM modes at every transition point. Topologically distinct
regions are shaded in different colors. (f) Evolution of chiral winding phase along kz at µ = 0, which suggests WS = −2.
As expected, an on-TRIM transition will change both
κ and CM by ±1, while an off-TRIM critical pair only
changes CM by ±2.
Given the information of the JT phase diagrams, we
now sketch a “deduced” vortex phase diagram:
1. There will be eight VLT transitions by varying µ.
2. On-TRIM JT transitions at µ = 0.79 and µ =
−0.69 will lead to two VLT transitions around the
same µ values.
3. Two off-TRIM critical pairs at µ = ±0.18, along
with two on-TRIM transition at µ = −0.16 and
µ = 0.06, will together lead to six neighboring VLT
transitions µ = 0.
4. Since κ = 1 for µ ∈(−0.69, −0.18) ∪(0.06, 0.79),
the surface vortex core should host a single MZM
for a large electron or hole doping regime, following
Eq. 3.
5. Since CM = 2 for µ ∈(−0.16, 0.06), we expect the
undoped system to feature a pair of decoupled vor-
tex MZMs, following Eq. 5.
We hope to highlight that the only caveat to the above
predictions, in particular #4 and #5, is the existence of
C4z symmetry.
As discussed in Sec. II E, a nontrivial
κ or CM may also correspond to nodal vortex phases,
rather than the gapped Majorana-carrying Kitaev vortex
phases.
Slightly breaking C4z in our system will rule
out the possibility of nodal vortices, making the above
predictions unambiguous.
With the predictions in mind, we now proceed to con-
duct vortex modeling of the Dirac octet. We consider an
in-plane lattice geometry with 150 × 150 unit cells and
a ˆz-directional vortex line penetrating the center of the
lattice. By plotting the CdGM spectrum at kz = 0, we
indeed find eight VLT transitions along µ, as shown in
Fig. 5 (e). The critical chemical potentials of VLT tran-
sitions are given by

−0.225, −0.225, −0.239, −0.628},

quantitatively agreeing with our predictions #2 and #3.
To understand the nature of the VLT transitions, we
employ different colors to label Jz of every CdGM band
in Fig. 5 (e). As discussed in Sec. II E, C4z enables a
(Z2)2 × Z VLT classification with three topological in-
dices: ζ0 ∈Z2, ζ2 ∈Z2, and Q1 ∈Z.
Therefore, a
Jz = 0(2) transition will change ν0(2) by 1, while one
with Jz = ±1 will change Q1 by ±1.
In addition to the C4z-related indices, the VLT also
features a chiral winding number WS ∈Z, as discussed
in Sec. II D. The chiral symmetry is S = MxΘΞ, with
which the Hamiltonian can always be reshaped into an
off-block-diagonal form,
