of AriaQuanta, we conducted tests on the implementation of RX, Hadamard, and CNOT gates across
a range of 1 to 12 qubits. The results, illustrated in Figure 3, reveal that the execution time of the
circuit increases exponentially as the number of qubits rises, which is consistent with our expectations.
As observed, AriaQuanta demonstrates superior performance when compared to other quantum software.

Summary
We have developed an open-source quantum software, AriaQuanta, designed for simulating quantum
circuits and algorithms.
It is user-friendly and accessible for all researchers in the field of quantum
computing. AriaQuanta supports the execution of conventional and variational quantum circuits and
algorithms, as well as noisy circuits.
Additionally, this software demonstrates superior performance
compared to other quantum software available.
