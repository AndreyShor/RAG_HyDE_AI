where 𝐻represents the square enclosure and the inner cylinder is specified with the space 𝑊. The square domain has
a side length 𝐿.
Consider a hot cylinder with a surface temperature 𝑇ℎsituated within a cold square enclosure with a surface
temperature 𝑇𝑐. The buoyancy force induces natural convection, with the solution to the energy equation (Eq. 3)
contributing to the source term of the momentum conservation equation (Eq. 2) via the Boussinesq approximation
[112]. Consequently, the velocity and temperature fields are coupled in the governing PDEs (Eqs. 1–3). According to
the Boussinesq approximation [112], the forcing terms are given by:
𝑓𝑥= 0,
(5)
𝑓𝑦= 𝜌𝐺𝛽(𝑇−𝑇ref),
(6)
where 𝐺denotes the magnitude of gravitational acceleration, 𝛽represents the thermal expansion coefficient, and 𝑇ref
is the reference temperature. The Rayleigh number (𝑅𝑎) is calculated as:
𝑅𝑎=
𝜌2𝑐𝑝𝐺𝛽(𝑇ℎ−𝑇𝑐)𝐿3
𝜅𝜇
,
(7)
and the Prandtl number (𝑃𝑟) is given by:
𝑃𝑟=
𝑐𝑝𝜇
𝜅.

We formulate the inverse problem as follows: given velocity boundary conditions on all boundaries, temperature
boundary conditions solely on the outer hot surface, and limited measurements of velocity, temperature, and pressure
fields at sensor locations, the goal is to reconstruct the complete velocity, temperature, and pressure fields at specific
inquiry points, with a particular interest in determining the temperature distribution on the surface of the inner cylinder.
Mathematically, this constitutes an ill-posed problem.
3. Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) layer
In this section, we explain the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layer framework. For clarity, let us consider a
KAN with a single hidden layer. The input to the network is a vector 𝐫of size 𝑑input, and the output is a vector 𝐬of size
𝑑output. In this configuration, the relationship between the input and output in the one-layer KAN is expressed as:
𝐬𝑑output×1 = 𝚽𝑑output×𝑑input𝐫𝑑input×1,
(9)
where the matrix 𝚽𝑑output×𝑑input is structured as follows:
𝚽𝑑output×𝑑input =
⎡

𝜓1,1(⋅)
