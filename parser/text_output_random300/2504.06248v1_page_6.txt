Hence, there are r = Bn −1 ways of partitioning the
leaves in at least two sets (to satisfy 3.3A and 3.3B) while
including them as sources in their respective subgraphs’
vertex sets W1, ..., Wr [Fig. 2 (c)] (to satisfy 3.1A and
3.1B). This setup makes r symmetry generators act on at
least one of the n−3 cross-ratios in such a way that Sη[cρ]
for some ρ and η are conserved. If ωs = ω + 2 Im(As) is
satisfied, Sη[cs(z)] is also conserved for all η. Of course,
not all of these constants are functionally independent;
their independence hinges on the specific network struc-
ture.
The simplest example is a directed star of 5 oscillators
with Koopman generator K = iωszs∂s+K2+K3+K4+K5,
where Kη = (iωzη + Aszs −¯
As¯zsz2
η) ∂η for η ∈{2, 3, 4, 5}
and As ∈C. Since there is a single source s, Thm. 1 di-
rectly implies that there is a monomial eigenfunction zs
with eigenvalue iωs and zse−iωst is conserved. Theorem 2
then guarantees the conservation of c2345. Furthermore,
there are four symmetry generators Sη = Kη −iωszη∂η
[Lem. S10] and Thm. 3 ensures that Sη[c2345] for all
η are conserved.
If, moreover, ωs = ω + 2 Im(As),
then the cross-ratio c1234 is also a constant of mo-
tion along with Sη[c1234] for all η.
Altogether, there
are 5 functionally independent constants of motion, say
zse−iωst, c1234, c2345, S2[c2345], S3[c2345], and the system
is completely integrated [Sec. IV F]. For As = σs/4 ∈R,
the explicit real form of the new constant of motion gen-
erated by S2 and c2345 (assumed positive) is
S2[(2/σs) ln c2345] = C12S12S45
S42S52

with Sjk = sin ((θj −θk)/2) and Cjk = cos ((θj −θk)/2).
Another basic example where the leaves of the star
are sources within two subgraphs is provided in supple-
mentary information [Sec. IV F] and Fig. 2(c) illustrates
more general motifs supporting symmetry-generated con-
stants of motion. Our results thus show new possibilities
for having N −3 (not necessarily all cross-ratios) to N
constants of motion.
Conclusion—Adopting Koopman’s perspective,
we
demonstrated that the celebrated Kuramoto model ad-
mits various possible forms of constants of motion de-
pending on the connection patterns between the oscilla-
tors. Knowing constants of motion enables the dimension
reduction of the model, as guaranteed by the preimage
theorem: the trajectories of a dynamics with n constants
of motion evolve on a manifold of dimension N −n. Our
findings hence challenge the idea that partial integrabil-
ity is restricted to identical and globally coupled phase
oscillators [62, 64, 73–75]. In fact, we have shown that
the seminal findings on identical phase oscillators can be
enriched and generalized to oscillators on networks with
various realistic complex networks properties.
More-
over, our results constitute a significant step toward the
identification of Lie symmetries—including approximate
ones—in dynamical systems on complex networks. Fu-
ture work may focus on classifying such symmetries and
uncovering new Koopman eigenfunctions and constants
of motion in general coupled oscillator dynamics [75–78].
