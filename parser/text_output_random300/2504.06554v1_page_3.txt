in the control software. The controlled-phase gate arises nat-
urally from the dispersive coupling between the transmon and
the photonic qubit, with the interaction time serving as a tun-
able control parameter. Each layer introduces seven varia-
tional parameters, and it can be proved that a single layer is
sufficient to prepare an arbitrary two-qubit state from a given
input state.
However, due to the limited bond dimension,
achieving arbitrary N + 1-qubit states across N layers is not
always feasible. Nevertheless, this limitation enhances effi-
ciency by focusing on the relevant subspace of quantum states
necessary for the problem at hand.
Given the presence of noise in the quantum system, im-
plementing an effective error mitigation strategy is crucial.
Previously, zero-noise extrapolation has been employed by
stretching gate time, i.e., changing the coherent interaction
strengths, to scale the effective noise strengths in each quan-
tum gate [18]. In contrast, our approach differs by injecting
noise through the direct control of the dominant decoherence
rates in our system, which we refer to as analog error miti-
gation. This approach is widely applicable to various experi-
mental systems, as certain coherent interaction strengths may
not be adjustable in practice. Specifically, we achieve this by
modifying the longitudinal relaxation time T1 and the trans-
verse relaxation time T ∗
2 of the transmon qubit. The evolution
of the quantum state (ρ) under the coherent Hamiltonian H
and noises can be described by the Lindblad master equation:
˙ρ = −i[H(t),ρ]+λL (ρ),
(2)
where λ is the noise strength and L is the Lindblad superop-
erator that describes the decoherence processes. By treating
the noises as perturbations to the quantum evolution, the ex-
pectation value of an observable of interest E(λ) can be ex-
panded as a power series around its zero-noise value E∗[16–
18]:
E(λ) = E∗+
n
∑
k=1
akλ k +O(λ n+1),
(3)
where ak are coefficients that depend on the specific details of
the noise model and the observable being measured. By ex-
perimentally obtaining the expectation values E(ciλ) at dif-
ferent noise levels ciλ, where ci are scaling factors, we can
extrapolate back to the zero-noise value E∗.

RESULTS
In our experiments, the dominant source of noise is the lon-
gitudinal relaxation of the transmon qubit. The storage cavity
has a longitudinal relaxation time that is an order of magni-
tude longer than that of the transmon qubit, while its trans-
verse relaxation is mainly induced by the transmon qubit due
to their dispersive coupling. Given that T ∗
2 > T1 for the trans-
mon qubit, the longitudinal relaxation of the transmon is the
dominant factor. Therefore, we focus on mitigating the ex-
cited state damping noise Γ1 of the transmon to suppress the
leading imperfections.

FIG. 2. (a) Schematic of the qubit noise injection technique, where
a strong drive Ωf0g1 is applied between the |f,0⟩qr and |g,1⟩qr states
to control the damping rate of the transmon qubit via the low-quality
factor readout cavity. (b) Longitudinal relaxation time T1 and (c)

2 of the transmon qubit as a function of
the drive amplitude Ωef for different Fock states in the storage cav-
ity. (d) Gate fidelity of the Hadamard gate and identity gate as a
function of Ωef. The gate fidelity is defined as the fidelity of the
Pauli transfer matrix, obtained via process tomography in the exper-
iment. The green data represent the gate fidelity when no pump is
applied (Ωf0g1 = 0), while the blue data show the fidelity with Ωf0g1
activated. The diamonds indicate the parameter c = 2.2, where both
gate fidelity and coherence time degrade by the same factor.
To address this, we implement a noise injection method to
the transmon qubit by directly controlling its damping rate
through the introduction of an additional population relax-
ation channel.
By leveraging the low-quality factor read-
out cavity [37, 38], as shown in Fig. 2(a), we apply a weak
drive with an amplitude Ωef that is resonant with the transi-
tion between the |e,0⟩qr state and the |f,0⟩qr state, facilitat-
ing the transfer of population from the first excited state of
the transmon to the second excited state |f⟩. Here, |e,0⟩qr
represents the joint quantum state of the composite transmon
qubit-readout cavity system, as indicated by the subscripts.
Subsequently, relaxation from the second excited state of the
transmon to the ground state is realized by inducing a decay
from the |f,0⟩qr state to |g,1⟩qr through a strong drive with an
amplitude Ωf0g1 applied to the transition between them. Ben-
efiting from the Purcell effect, the readout cavity has a rel-
atively large decay rate Γr, and the induced relaxation chan-
nel is approximately a Markovian process when the condition
Ωef ≪Ωf0g1 ≪Γr is satisfied. Therefore, this setup effectively
introduces additional damping noise to the computational ba-
sis states |g⟩and |e⟩of the transmon qubit, with the added
