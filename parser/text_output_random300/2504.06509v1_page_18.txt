Methods 
Device Fabrication and Film Growth 
The pMTJ stack was deposited on a thermally oxidized Si substrate at room temperature using 
DC and RF magnetron sputtering in the Shamrock system. The base pressure during deposition 
was maintained at < 5 × 10−8 Torr. The layer structure of the fabricated stack is as follows 
(thicknesses in nm): Ta(5) / Pd(3) / Co(0.3) / Pd(0.7) / Co(0.3) / Ru(0.6) / Ta(0.3) / CoFeB(1) 
/ MgO(2.0) / CoFeB(1.3) / Ta(0.7) / [Pd(0.7) / Co(0.3)]4 / Pd(5). RTP-600S Rapid Thermal 
Processing System was used for the rapid thermal annealing (RTA) with the temperature of 
350°C for 20 min to develop perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). The magnetic 
properties of the film stacks were characterized using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) 
in a Dynacool chamber (Quantum Design). Thin films were patterned into circularly shaped 
MTJ devices with diameters of 100, 120, 150, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 nm using electron-
beam lithography (EBL) and argon (Ar) ion-beam milling. The electrical size of the devices 
was validated through the size dependent resistance. The extracted large resistance-area (RA) 
product of around 3.93× 104 Ω ∙μ𝑚2 showed good agreement with the thick MgO thickness 
of 2 nm.
