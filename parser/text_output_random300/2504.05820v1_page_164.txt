and relate the PDFs of the latter to the PDFs of the former assuming isospin symmetry.
W -boson longitudinal single-spin asymmetry. We include the measurement of the longitudi-
nal single-spin asymmetry for W ±-boson production in polarized proton-proton collisions,

, performed by STAR at a center-of-mass-energy √s = 510 GeV [352]. The measure-
ment combines events recorded during the 2011-2012 and 2013 runs, and it supersedes
the previous one [353]. It is given as a differential distribution in the lepton pseudo-
rapidity ηℓ±, which is proportional to the W ±-boson rapidity, and it covers the interval
−1.25 ≤ηℓ± ≤+1.25. The details of the measurement are summarized in Table 5.2.
We compute the corresponding theoretical predictions with a modified version of MCFM [354],
which we interfaced to PineAPPL up to NLO. Given the complexity of the computation,
NNLO corrections are included, for both the unpolarized and polarized cross-sections
entering the asymmetry, by means of a K-factor, which we determine with the same
version of MCFM. We observe that NNLO corrections are generally small (at most of O(3%))
and that they are relatively independent of the lepton rapidity, consistently with [354,
Fig. 2]. This follows from cancellations occurring between the polarized numerator and
the unpolarized denominator in the asymmetry.
Single-inclusive jet and dijet longitudinal double-spin asymmetry. We include measurements
of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry for single-inclusive jet and dijet production in
polarized proton-proton collisions, A1-;2-jet

, performed by PHENIX [355] at a center-of-
mass energy √s = 200 GeV, and by STAR at center-of-mass energies √s = 200 GeV [356,
357, 358] and √s = 510 GeV [359, 360]. The measurements are given as distributions dif-
ferential in the transverse momentum of the leading jet, pT , in the case of single-inclusive
jet production, and in the invariant mass of the dijet system, mjj, in the case of dijet
production. For dijet production, we consider all the topologies provided. The details of
these measurements, which include their kinematic coverage, are summarized in Table 5.3.
We compute the corresponding theoretical predictions with the code presented in [361,
362], which we interfaced to PineAPPL, and modified to handle the necessary cuts that
define different dijet topologies. Predictions are accurate up to NLO, given that NNLO
corrections are not known yet. We therefore supplement them with a theory uncertainty,
