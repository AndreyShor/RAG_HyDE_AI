1.1
The periodic Lorentz Gas
From now on, in this introduction we will assume 0 < ε < 1
2, the obstacles’ centers c to be located in εZd and to have
radius rε := ε
d
d−1 . Therefore the available region where a particle can move is
Zε := {x ∈Rd : dist(x, εZd) ≥ε
d
d−1 }.
(1.1.1)
This way, the free path length of a particle moving in Zε according to (1.0.1) and (1.0.2) can be defined as
τε(x, v) := inf{t > 0 : x + tv ∈∂Zε},
(x, v) ∈Zε × S1.
The setting where the gas is to be studied for fixed time t > 0 is exactly (1.1.1), indeed this condition ensures that
the obstacles’ density is ≃1/εd. Therefore, since a circular tube (of radius ε
d
d−1 , that is the obstacles’ radius) around
the line drawn by trajectory in the time interval [0, t] has volume ≃(ε
d
d−1 )d−1t = tεd, the mean obstacles number hit
before time t is ≃tεd · 1/(εd) = t. Thus, in this setting the mean free path length should have order 1 as ε →0 (see
for example Dumas-Dumas-Golse [8] and Golse [11]). Nevertheless, an equivalent (and perhaps more common) setting
considered in literature involves placing the obstacles in Zd (instead of εZd), making them have radius ε
1
d−1 (instead
of ε
d
d−1 ) and studying the dynamics at times t/ε (instead of t).
The distribution of the free path length in the Boltzmann-Grad limit.
In the Boltzmann-Grad limit of the
periodic Lorentz gas, Bourgain-Golse-Wennberg [3] and Golse-Wennberg [12] proved that, if one denotes by A/B the
quotient of A with respect to the equivalence relation x ∼y ⇔x −y ∈B, being νε is the uniform probability measure
on Zε/(εZd) × Sd−1, then
Φε(t) := νε{(x, v) ∈Zε/(εZd) × Sd−1 : τε(x, v) > t} ≃
1
td−1 ,
(1.1.2)
where f ≃g means that there exists a constant C > 0 such that C−1g ≤f ≤Cg, and such a constant in the above
inequality does not depend on ε. In other words, Φε is the probability that the free path length is larger than t: in
dimension d = 2, (1.1.2) makes clear that the mean free path length is not finite if the average is computed with
respect to νε. Instead, it is if one substitutes νε with another probability measure concentrated on the boundary of
the obstacles (see [8]).
In dimension d = 2, a result related to (1.1.2) was obtained by Caglioti-Golse [5], indeed the authors provided the
exact asymptotic behavior (for large t) of the limit, as ε →0, of Φε, i.e.

Boca-Zaharescu [1] strenghtened their method obtaining exact estimates for limε→0 Φε(t) (that is, the limiting distri-
bution of the free path length) at any fixed time t ≥0.
Then, Caglioti-Golse [6, 7], Marklof-Strömbergsson [15] and Bykovskii-Ustinovin [4] found an explicit expression
for the transition kernel Q in dimension d = 2, that is
Definition 1.1.

if |h′| ≤h,
(1.1.3)
and the definition extends to all h, h′ ∈[−1, 1] by using the symmetries
Q(s, h|h′) = Q(s, h′|h) = Q(s, −h| −h′).
That is the Boltzmann-Grad limit of the (infinitesimal) probability that the next obstacle will be hit in time s and
with impact parameter h, conditioning the impact parameter of the previous collision to be h′. The impact parameter
h is defined for finite ε > 0 as h := sin( d
v′nx), with v′ the velocity after the next collision and nx the exterior normal
to the obstacle in the impact site x. This way, the limiting probability that the next obstacle will be hit in time t
writes as a function of the transition kernel Q.
The stated results about the structure of the transition probability Q hold for (x, v) randomly distributed on
Zε × S1 with a probability density absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure instead of being uniformly
distributed on Zε/(εZ2) × S1. Moreover, in [16] the authors also provided a definition for the impact parameter h
and for the kernel Q for dimensions d ≥3: their results involve all the dimensions d ≥2 but Q has not an explicit
formulation for all the times s for dimensions d ̸= 2.
