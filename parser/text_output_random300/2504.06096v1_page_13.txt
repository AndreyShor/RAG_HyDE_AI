Supplemental Material
The unbinned maximum-likelihood fit to the pµ+µ−invariant mass, as described in the
main text, is reported in its full fit range in Fig. 7.
Figure 8 reports the resolution on the dimuon invariant mass, as obtained from
simulation, as a function of the dimuon invariant mass in the full signal range.
The distribution of the pµ−invariant mass in the pπ−hypothesis is reported in Fig. 9
for Σ+ →pµ+µ−candidates in data, without the Λ veto (shown as red lines).
The distribution of the BDT output is shown in Fig. 10(left) for simulated signal
events and for background in data from the sidebands of the invariant-mass distribution
(candidates in the range mpµ+µ−< 1173 MeV/c2 or 1205 < mpµ+µ−< 1400 MeV/c2).
Candidates in data are divided into those that pass the Λ veto and those that do not pass
it. Figure 10(right) shows the BDT output distribution for candidates in data above the
chosen threshold value and background subtracted, compared with the signal simulated
sample.
Figures 11 and 12 show the distribution in background-subtracted Σ+ →pµ+µ−
candidates in data for the Σ+ transverse momentum (pT), pseudorapidity (η) and flight
distance with respect to the primary vertex. The distributions are compared with the
ones from the signal simulated sample.
