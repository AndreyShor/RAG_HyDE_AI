(2.1) is not invariant under gauge transformations of the M-theory three form C3; one picks

where Λ2 is the gauge parameter.
The deep insight of [2] was that this anomalous variation may be cancelled by the addition
of suitable chiral degrees of freedom at the M-theory boundaries. Specifically, reference [2]
considers ten-dimensional chiral fermions charged under a gauge group G. Their perturbative
anomaly is encoded in terms of a twelve-dimensional anomaly polynomial

which we may add to (2.3) to obtain the total anomaly theory of M-theory on a manifold
with boundary. At first sight, (2.5) and (2.3) are very different – they even involve different
gauge potentials. However, one may impose a boundary condition
G4|∂Y11 = a c2 + b p1,
(2.6)
where a, b are so far undetermined coefficients; p1 is the first Pontryagin class of the tan-
gent bundle of the boundary, and c2 is the second Chern class of the G gauge fields living
there in some reference representation. The identification is supposed to hold at the level of
cohomology only, but substituting G4 by its expression in terms of gauge and gravitational
characteristic classes, the anomalous theory (2.3) takes the form

(2.7)
This looks exactly like a gauge-gravity anomaly polynomial – albeit a very special one, where
only the class c2 (and no higher Chern classes) appear, and which factorizes in a precise way.
In [2, 3], it was further assumed that the boundary theory preserves N = 1 supersym-
metry. This means that the only chiral fermions that can appear are gaugini, so the whole
boundary theory is fixed by the choice of gauge group G. Remarkably, for two copies G = E8

which is exactly of the form (2.7) for a = 1/60, b = 1/4 (where c2 is the Chern class in the
adjoint representation of E8) once (2.2) is used, thereby cancelling perturbative anomalies.
The term 1
2PGrav(R) corresponds to the contribution of the 10d chiral fields coming from the
11d gravitino reduced on the interval.
