We study renormalization group flows in far-from-equilibrium states.
The study is made
tractable by focusing on states that are spatially homogeneous, time-independent, and scale-
invariant. Such states, in which mode k has occupation numbers nk ∼k−γ, are well known in
nonlinear physics. RG flow in such states is qualitatively different from that in the vacuum —
a positive γ decreases the dimension of an operator, turning marginal interactions into relevant
interactions. We compute one-loop beta functions. Depending on the sign of the beta function,
backreaction may either cause a minor shift of the state in the IR, or completely change the nature
of the state. Focusing on nearly marginal interactions, we construct an analog of the epsilon ex-
pansion and IR fixed points, with epsilon now set by the scaling of the interaction rather than the
spacetime dimension. In the language of RG flow, critical-balance scaling – which has applications
in fields as varied as astrophysics and ocean waves – corresponds to the state dynamically adjusting
itself along the RG flow until the interaction becomes marginal.
