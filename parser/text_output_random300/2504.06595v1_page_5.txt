FIG. 1. Model system. A simple cubic lattice, depicted in
(a), where each lattice ion couples to its 6 nearest neighbors
(shown in green) with a coupling k1, and to its 12 next-nearest
neighbors (shown in orange) with a coupling k2.
(b) The
phonon dispersion computed using the dynamical matrix in
Eq. (21) for m = 3.5 meV ps2/˚A2, a = 3 ˚A, k1 = 520 meV/˚A2,
and k2 = 170 meV/˚A2. (c) Diagonal element of the recoil ma-

provides support for the time-local treatment. (d),(e) Distri-
butions of displacements and speeds of the framework ions due
to thermal motion at different temperatures. Solid curves are
analytic Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and shaded areas
are histograms obtained from numerically generated displace-
ments for a system of 60 × 60 × 60 unit cells.

To illustrate this decay, we plotted its diagonal element
Wd(t) for our model system as a function of time in
Fig. 1(c).
We see that, despite its oscillatory nature,
this term decays rapidly for t ≳0.2 ps, corresponding
to the period of the fastest mode. We reiterate that the
maximum phonon frequency chosen here is substantially
smaller than the typical values seen in ionic conductors,
which are closer to 20 THz. Therefore, the recoil kernel
in stiffer real materials is expected to decay even faster.
In the context of ionic motion, the homogeneous por-
tion rH(t) = P

2 εj corresponds to thermal vi-
brations of the lattice and the amplitudes of ζj(t) =
Aj cos(Ωjt+ϕj) need to reflect this fact. Writing Aj(nj)
explicitly as a function of the quantum excitation level,
we have

probability distribution e−nΩj/ΩT . The phase ϕj, on the
other hand, is uniformly distributed over [0, 2π].
To get a better feel for the framework’s thermal mo-
tion, we consider a system of 60 × 60 × 60 unit cells.
We generate rH(0) and ˙rH(0) for several temperatures
by sampling Aj’s and ϕj’s and then construct the his-
tograms for the framework mass displacement and speed
if Fig. 1(d) and (e), respectively.
Because it consists of independent harmonics with ran-
dom phases and thermally-distributed amplitudes, rH(t)
is a stationary Gaussian process with zero mean and a
covariance matrix given by

Diagonal elements of C
↔(0) give the variance of the frame-
work atoms’ displacements along individual Cartesian
directions.
Multiplying the summand in the penulti-
mate line of Eq. (24) by Ω2
l gives the covariance ma-
trix for velocities.
The total displacement probability
distribution is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann form
4πr2 exp(−r2/2σ2)/(2πσ)3/2, where σ is the square root
of C
↔(0)’s diagonal element. Similarly, we compute the
standard deviation for the velocity. In Fig. 1(d) and (e),
we see excellent agreement between simulated histograms
and analytic forms of the distributions over a range of
temperatures.
Finally, to describe the interaction between the frame-
work and the particle, we follow our earlier work [23–
26] and adopt a simplified form by assuming that U
is given by the sum of pairwise terms coupling the
mobile particle and individual framework masses.
