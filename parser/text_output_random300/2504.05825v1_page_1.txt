Abstract 
The propagation of an electrostatic wave in three component e-p-i astrophysical quantum plasma 
in a rotating frame has been studied, taking into account the particleâ€™s spin, Fermi pressure and 
quantum Bohm potential. Spin polarization plays a key role in explaining the dynamics of 
quantum plasmas, especially in astrophysical contexts due to the high external magnetic field 
prevalent in such environments. Effects specific to this particular environment like rotation as 
well as gravity have also been included. Coupled dispersion of electron, positron and ion modes 
have been obtained. Further, the investigation of solitary wave by Korteweg-de-Vries method 
has been carried out and soliton solution has been obtained. Quantum effects increase wave 
dispersion and soliton stability in quantum plasma, thereby affecting the electrostatic potential.
