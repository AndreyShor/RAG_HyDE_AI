The long time evolution of a density depending on (θ, s, h).
The aim of this Section is to prove Theorem 1.1, which states that if µ0 ∈L1 ∩Lp(T1
2π × [0, +∞) × [−1, 1]) and µt is
a solution of
µt(θ, s, h) = µ0(θ, s + t, h) +

up for a constant C > 0 depending only on Q.
As we said in the introduction, the first term which µt is composed of represents again the probability density of
the particles for which no collision has occurred until time t. The second one can be understood as the probability
density that at least a collision has occurred before time t. From the equation above we can preliminary notice that
the long time behavior of µt is determined by the long time behavior of µt(θ, 0, h), which is in turn determined by the
equation
µt(θ, 0, h) = µ0(θ, t, h) +

(2.0.1)
Now if µt(θ, 0, h) = c, by (2.0.1) we get µ0(θ, t, h) = cE(t, h) and therefore by (1.1.9) µt ≡cE at any time t.
Therefore the rate of convergence of µt(θ, s, h) to the equilibrium state is determined by the rate of convergence of
µt(θ, 0, h) to the constant ⟨µ0⟩
2π , that is what we are going to study in the next steps.
2.1
Writing µt(θ, 0, h) as a linear function of µ0.
In this Subsection we collect some results that allow us to prove Theorem 1.1. In particular we want to write µt(θ, 0, h)
as a linear function of µ0 to get a better estimate of its long time behavior. Therefore the first purpose is to prove
now the following intermediate result.
Proposition 2.1. There exists a function φ ∈L∞(T1
2π × [0, +∞) × [−1, 1]2; R) depending only on the kernel Q such
that for every µ0 ∈L1(T1
2π ×[0, +∞)×[−1, 1]) the evaluation at s = 0 of its time evolution writes as an affine function
of φ and a linear function of µ0 as

This Proposition is all what we need to prove Theorem 1.1. We can observe that among all the summands which
µt(θ, 0, h) is split in the statement of Proposition 2.1, the most similar to ⟨µ0⟩
2π is the third one, and the other ones are
vanishing for large t (we will state and prove it rigorously later).
We are finally splitting the probability (density) that a collision occurs at time t (that is, µt(θ, 0, h)) in four
contributions: the first and the second one are understood respectively as the probability that the first and the second
collision occur exactly at time t, while the sum of third and the fourth one as the probability that at least two collisions
happened before time t.
To prove Proposition 2.1 we make several steps by some preliminary Lemmas. We first recall the Definition 1.8 of
the function f, that is,
f(θ, t, h|h′) :=
