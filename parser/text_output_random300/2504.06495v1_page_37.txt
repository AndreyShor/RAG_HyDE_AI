meaning the endogenous threshold behaves precisely like the exogenous threshold assumed
in earlier sections. Moreover, substituting the expression for α from Theorem 5 into (16)
yields β = 1/(1 −ε) which we already anticipated in equation (26). Consequently, in the
limit ε →0, we obtain β = 1.
This conﬁrms the objective of the current section.
It is important to reiterate that,
while we continue to use the same branching process as before — now with an endogenized
threshold rule — the interpretation has changed: we now assume the process began long
ago, reaching a steady state by the time any quantum experiment is performed. From this
perspective, the resulting threshold behavior ξτ appears exogenous when viewed within the
smaller subtree of the multiverse considered in earlier sections. The next section will further
clarify this overall picture.

A comprehensive view of measurement and Born rule
The previous sections introduced the key components and results of our framework step
by step. With the necessary technical tools now in place, we are ready to present a more
comprehensive mathematical description of the measurement process and the emergence of
the Born rule. In doing so, this section will also provide a conceptual justiﬁcation for the
limiting conditions ǫ →0 and ǫ · t →∞that appeared in Theorems 1 and 2.
For mathematical convenience, we again work with the continuous-time branching process
introduced in Section 4.2. More speciﬁcally, the setup we analyze in this section is as follows:
(A) We assume that the process Xpast
τ
has evolved according to (18) for a long time in the
past, τ < 0. We also assume that the parameters µ and σ satisfy µ/σ2 = 1. As shown
in Theorem 4, this implies that the distribution of Xpast
0
at time τ = 0 is the stationary
