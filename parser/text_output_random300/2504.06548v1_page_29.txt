and its potential applications – in reconfigurable magnonics,
where magnons act as information carriers, and in neuromor-
phic computing, where ASI arrays can simulate brain-inspired
processes22,28,244,245,249 – aims to help researchers new to the
field grasp these opportunities.
Future research in artificial spin ice aims to push the field’s
boundaries even further. By integrating geometry optimiza-
tion and material engineering, researchers can fine-tune lat-
tice interactions, leading to unique magnetization dynamics.
In addition to ordered geometric arrays, disordered or ‘glassy’
artficial spin systems263 (or ‘ASG’) hold interest and promise
both for fundamental physics and statistical mechanics, and
also for functional applications such as hardware Hopfield
networks and Ising machines well-suited for challenging op-
timisation problems with real-world relevance such as Trav-
elling Salesman264. The software models such as Hopfield
networks currently used on these problems today are directly
inspired by spin glass physics243.
The use of low-damping materials is expected to enhance
spin-wave propagation, improving the performance of ASI-
based devices in room-temperature applications. Addition-
ally, hybrid systems that integrate ASI with nanoscale tech-
nologies – including superconductors, photonics, and quan-
tum systems – hold promise for the development of multi-
functional devices with unprecedented capabilities265–267.
Emerging dynamic control techniques, such as surface
acoustic waves, spin-orbit coupling, and electric fields, are an-
ticipated to enable real-time reconfiguration of ASI systems,
unlocking the full potential of ASI-based processing and com-
puting.
Looking ahead, research will likely focus on multilayer
(2.5D) and fully 3D ASI structures, facilitating more complex
interconnections and functionalities11. The integration of van
der Waals magnets and the potential for twist-engineering ar-
tificial spin ice present exciting opportunities to explore novel
physical phenomena and realize new applications. Utilizing
machine learning techniques is expected to accelerate the op-
timization of ASI designs and their scalability for practical ap-
plications. These advancements could drive the development
of ASI-based systems for logic devices, data storage, quantum
computing, and energy-efficient on-chip processing – bridg-
ing fundamental physics with cutting-edge technology265–267.
