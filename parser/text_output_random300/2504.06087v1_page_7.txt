Discussion
We have pushed the boundary of NN-VMC in the two
most important dimensions: efficiency and accuracy.
Unlike traditional VMC, FiRE qualitatively and quan-
titatively reconstructs experimental results on various
challenging systems, even in cases where contempo-
rary NN-VMC disagrees.
At the same time, FiRE
accelerates NN-VMC by O(nel), yielding speedups of
up to an order of magnitude for the systems investi-
gated. With FiRE, we obtain highly accurate energies
for system sizes, which become inaccessible to many
high-accuracy methods, and the remaining ones require
expert knowledge to be applied correctly. Compared
to methods like MR-CI or CCSD(T), our NN-VMC
works out of the box and requires no method combi-
nations, basis sets, or active space, reducing the need
for expert knowledge for high-accuracy quantum chem-
istry.
Furthermore, unlike other methods, NN-VMC
yields accurate energies and provides the correspond-
ing wave function, thus giving, in principle, access to
any ground-state property. While NN-VMC has so far
rarely been applied to practical chemical problems, we
firmly believe FiRE is fast and accurate enough to earn
a place in the practitioner’s toolbox.
Still, open questions and challenges remain.
While
we obtain state-of-the-art results for several systems
containing a variety of non-local interactions, the as-
sumptions of our FiRE may fail for some classes of
systems. Compared to dense NN-VMC, FiRE’s abso-
lute energies are less accurate when choosing an ag-
gressive cutoff. In agreement with previous works [10],
we observed that larger systems require more optimiza-
tion steps, an issue that is not unique to NN-VMC –
conventional methods are also increasingly complicated
to converge with increasing system size and require
careful tuning of optimization parameters [42]. FiRE
also adds some implementation complexity compared
to dense NN-VMC because implementations for low-
rank updates, sparse forward-mode Laplacian compu-
tations, and padding for GPUs are necessary (App. I).
Finally, while in the limit of many electrons, the scal-
ing remains the same for periodic or bulk systems;
densely packed structures increase the neighborhood
size, yielding higher compute times.
We expect future work to investigate these aspects and
further improve our approach’s accuracy and compute
time, at last, by transferring deep learning advance-
ments to ab-initio quantum chemistry.
Further, we
hope that our quantitative convergence rate results
serve as the basis for further research into how NN-
VMC scaling depends on system properties, such as
the spectral gap, and optimization choices, such as pre-
conditioning and learning rate scheduling. Beyond the
study of gas-phase molecules, we expect FiRE to ac-
celerate progress in various fields of the physical sci-
ences as it is directly applicable to the many domains
in which NN-VMC has shown early promise, such as
photochemistry [43], solid-state physics [44, 45], nu-
clear physics [46], positron chemistry [47], polaritonic
chemistry [48] or the study of topological materials [49].

Variational Monte Carlo
We seek to solve the stationary Schr¨odinger equation
within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation
ˆH |Ψ⟩= E |Ψ⟩
(8)
where ˆH : H2 →L2 is the Hamiltonian operator and
Ψ : Rnel×3 →R is the electronic wave function. Here,
we follow standard practice and use a spin-assigned
wavefunction where the first N↑electrons are spin-up
and the latter nel −N↑are spin-down. In atomic units,
the Hamiltonian for a molecular system is given by
ˆH := −1

We assume that the minimum of the spectrum of ˆH is
given as an isolated eigenvalue E0 of finite multiplicity,
which we call the ground-state energy and correspond-
ing eigenfunctions are referred to as ground states. To
compute ground states/ground-state energies and solve
Equation 8, we seek to minimize the variational energy
E [Ψ] = ⟨Ψ| ˆH |Ψ⟩
⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩

where ρΨ(r) = Ψ(r)2
⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩. By the Raleigh-Ritz principle,
upper bounds the ground-state energy E0.
To com-
pute E[Ψ], we use importance sampling to evaluate the
expectation in Eq. (10) using the Metroplis-Hastings
algorithm.
The so-called local energy EL(r) can be
computed via

where V is the potential energy, i.e., the last three
terms in Eq. (9). Note that we, in practice, use pseu-
dopotentials as described by Li et al. [12].
We aim to approximate E0 by minimizing θ 7→E[Ψθ]
over a parametrized class {Ψθ} of (neural network-
based) wave functions. To this end we use gradient-
based optimization
θt+1 = θt −ηtδt
(12)
with learning rate ηt ∈R+ and update δt. While one
could naively use the gradient of the energy
∇θE[Ψ] ∝EρΨ [(EL(r) −EρΨ [EL(r)]) ∇θ ln |Ψ(r)|]
