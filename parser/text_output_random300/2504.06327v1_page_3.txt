Physics-informed KAN PointNet
To construct shared KAN layers in PointNet, we employ Jacobi polynomials. The test case addressed in this
study involves solving the inverse problem of natural convection over 135 geometries simultaneously, with the goal of
predicting the velocity, pressure, and temperature fields over these 135 domains. The governing equations consist of
the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in two dimensions, which are coupled together. We utilize PyTorch’s
automatic differentiation [111] to incorporate the partial differential equations into the loss function of PI-KAN-
PointNet. Additionally, we explore the impact of different types and degrees of Jacobi polynomials on the performance
of PI-KAN-PointNet. The depth of the network is examined to determine the optimal architecture for solving this
inverse problem and minimizing computational expenses. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison is made between
the proposed PI-KAN-PointNet and the physics-informed PointNet with MLPs (i.e., PIPN [20]). Finally, we examine
a hybrid architecture that integrates KAN and MLP layers within the PI-KAN-PointNet framework. Specifically, we
analyze the performance of PI-KAN-PointNet, where MLP layers are incorporated in the encoder while KAN layers
are used in the decoder, and vice versa.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the governing equations for
natural convection. Section 3 details the architecture of KAN layers. Section 4 elaborates on integrating KAN layers
into PointNet and establishing PI-KAN-PointNet for solving inverse problems. Section 5 covers the computational
setup, dataset, and details of the deep learning framework. Section 6.1 presents an analysis of PI-KAN-PointNet’s
performance, including the impact of various parameters on result accuracy. Section 6.2 compares PI-KAN-PointNet
with physics-informed PointNet using MLPs. Section 6.3 discusses the performance of alternative architectures for
PI-KAN-PointNet. Section 6.4 proposes a physics-informed PointNet combined with both MLPs and KANs, where
one serves as the encoder and the other as the decoder, and vice versa. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the research
findings and discusses potential future directions.
2. Benchmark case: Natural convection in a square enclosure containing a cylinder
To assess the capabilities of physics-informed PointNet with KAN for solving inverse problems, we consider the
benchmark test case of natural convection in a square enclosure with a cylinder, which leads to thermally driven flow.
A physics-informed neural network we used by Cai et al. [31] to solve an inverse problem involving two-dimensional
forced convection heat transfer (see Fig. 2 of [31]). Moreover, Cai et al. [31] utilized their proposed physics-informed
neural network to reconstruct the thermal fields of steady and unsteady mixed convection heat transfer for flow past a
circular cylinder. Additionally, Wang et al. [30] applied a physics-informed neural network to solve an inverse problem
in natural convection within a square enclosure containing a circular inner cylinder.
The governing equations for the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy for an incompressible, steady-state
flow of a Newtonian fluid in two-dimensional space are given by:

𝜌(u ⋅∇)u −𝜇Δu + ∇𝑝= f

where u is the velocity vector with components 𝑢and 𝑣in the 𝑥and 𝑦directions, respectively. The variables 𝑝and
𝑇represent the pressure and temperature, respectively, while f denotes the external body force, with 𝑓𝑥and 𝑓𝑦
corresponding to its components in the 𝑥and 𝑦directions. The fluid density is denoted by 𝜌, the dynamic viscosity by
𝜇, the thermal conductivity by 𝜅, and the specific heat at constant pressure by 𝑐𝑝. Energy dissipation is neglected in
Eq. 3. The fluid domain 𝑉is a non-simply connected region defined as:
