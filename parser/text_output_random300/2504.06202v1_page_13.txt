On E1, conditionally on Σ, eγ is a chordal SLEκ in H between f(a) and f(b). By Proposition 2.2,
we have
P[E2 | Σ] ≍εξ2(κ)|f(a) −f(b)|ξ+
2 (κ).
(3.9)
Note that the following quantity does not depend on ε,

(3.10)
The reason that (3.10) is in (0, ∞) is similar to (3.5). Combining (3.8), (3.9), (3.10), we can deduce
the lower bound P
A2(ε, r)
 ≳εξ2(κ).
Let E3 be the event that eγ intersects ∂B8ε/r. Similarly to (3.6), we can deduce that
P
A2(ε, r) ∩G(ε, r)
 ≤P[E1 ∩E3] = E[P[E3 | Σ]1E1] ≲εξ2(κ).
By Lemma 3.3, this further implies the upper bound P
A2(ε, r)
 ≲εξ2(κ), and completes the proof
for the interior case.

Separation lemma for CLE
This section is dedicated to deriving separation lemmas for CLE, or equivalently loop-soup clusters,
in various settings. They are in fact slightly stronger than the simplified version stated in the
introduction as Theorem 1.2.
This section is structured as follows. We first consider the interior case in Section 4.1, where we
give a stronger separation lemma (Proposition 4.1), that will eventually be used in the derivation
of Thereom 1.1, and as an intermediate step, we introduce an alternative version for the BLS
(Lemma 4.3), which is stated in terms of a key notion called quality. We collect results for the
BLS in Section 4.2, which are analogs in the continuum of properties derived in [13] for the discrete
setting, i.e. the random walk loop soup. Next, we use these results to establish Lemma 4.3 and
Proposition 4.1 in Section 4.3. We then show the up-to-constants estimates between E1(ε, r) and
E2(ε, r) in Section 4.4.
Finally, in Section 4.5, we summarize the corresponding results in the
boundary case.
4.1
Interior case
Suppose r < 1/2. On the event E2(ε, r), there are two loops γ1 and γ2 that intersect both ∂Bε and
∂Br. Let G2(ε, r) be the event that the following conditions all hold
• γj ⊂(Br ∪Br/10(rei(j−1)π)) \ Br/10(reijπ) for j = 1, 2,
• all the loops in Γ \ {γ1, γ2} have diameter less than r/40.
Proposition 4.1. For κ ∈(8/3, 4], there exists a constant c > 0 such that for all 0 < 2ε < r < 1/2,
P(E2(ε, r)) ≤c P(E2(ε, r) ∩G2(ε, r)).
Remark 4.2. This type of separation lemma also holds in the discrete setting, if we replace the
Brownian loop soup clusters by the random walk loop soup clusters everywhere in the definition of
the events.
