integer, ||Gζ,l
α |⟩is extracted just by ignoring the sign bit. The inequality test then proceeds on ||Gζ,l
α |⟩and
| ˜Gζ,l
α ⟩, producing a state with amplitudes proportional to |Gζ,l
α |. To modify the resultant state so that it
encodes amplitudes proportional to Gζ,l
α itself, we only need to apply a single Pauli Z to the sign bit.
The total Toffoli cost of Steps 1-15 is then 4˜n + 2n2 + 7bn + 51
4 b2 + 32b −2nmax(nmax + b) + 116. Note
that, in the rejection sampling procedure outlined in [75], in order to amplify we must call this subroutine
(including its dagger) multiple times. In Table 6, we denote the number of amplification rounds by R. In [75],
we require 1 + R queries to the routine and 1 + R to its dagger (see Table 1 therein). However, given that
the steps above only consist of coherent arithmetic we can retain the intermediate ancillas and apply the
dagger at no Toffoli cost. As shown in Fig. 9, for all elements that we have tested, we can safely take R ≤2
with small tweaks to the reference function.
We also require ancillas to store the intermediate arithmetic quantities.
Specifically, we require an-
cillas to store |kp2|2, (¯rζ
l |kp2|)2, (¯rζ
l |kp2|)4, P
x cx,la(¯rζ
l |kp2|)2x, [Y α
l,ζ]a
Pa−1
x=0 cx,la(¯rζ
l |k|)2x (for each a),
P3
a=1[Y α
l,ζ]a
Pa−1
x=0 cx,la(¯rζ
l |k|)2x, γ∥kp2∥1, the exponential term, and ¯Gζ,l
α itself. If we assume that |kp2|2 is
computed to b bits, we require roughly 2b, 4b, 8b, 8b, 24b, 8b, 2b, b and 8b qubits for each register, respectively
(for a total of 65b qubits). While we expect that we can truncate without significantly affecting the quality
of the output state, we do not carry out that analysis in this work.

Inequality tests
Inequality tests are necessary for rejection sampling for in the nonlocal term. For the steps in Sec. 5.1.5, this
requires checking whether |G|
˜
G M ≥m, for some target state |G|, reference state ˜G, number of samples M
and a uniform superposition over m = 1, . . . , M. Given that the quantity |G|
˜
G has already been computed in
previous steps, we only need to cost the two multiplications to prepare each side of the inequality test and
the test itself. However, we make the simplifying assumption that M is a power of two (or more precisely,
for any target M as specified by the error budget, we prepare over ˜
M = 2⌈log M⌉amplitudes). This can only
increase the fidelity with which the target state has prepared, and makes the preparation for the inequality
test trivial. In particular, both preparing the uniform state over m and multiplying by M has no non-Clifford
cost. The only cost, therefore, is for the inequality test itself, which has cost b + b ˜
M (where b ˜
M = log ˜
M).
For R rounds of amplification, this inequality test must be repeated 1 + R times (and its dagger R times).
However, the dagger can be implemented with no Toffoli cost if ancillas are retained. The total cost is
therefore (1 + R)(b + b ˜
M).
We require an extra b ˜
M qubits to pad for the multiplication and b + b ˜
M for the inequality test.

Pl: block encoding the Legendre polynomial
We aim to prepare the block encoding
X
p1,p2∈G
Pl
 kp2 · kp1
|kp1||kp2|

|p2⟩⟨p2| ⊗|p1⟩⟨p1|.
(231)
The steps to prepare this block encoding are given in Sec. 5.1.5, Step 3, but we collate the costs here. As
in Sec. E.5.4, intermediate quantities are computed in signed integer representation. As noted in the main
body, we can prepare a uniform superposition over m = 1, . . . , M basis states and then check the inequalities





M ≥m,
l = 0,
(kp1 · kp2)M ≥|kp1||kp2|m,
l = 1,
[3(kp1 · kp2)2 −|kp1|2|kp2|2]M ≥2|kp1|2|kp2|2m,
l = 2.
(232)
Rearranging the above inequalities recovers the correct inequality test for the Legendre polynomial. We
already have |kp2| stored as an intermediate quantity from the previous step, which we can reuse. The
substeps are as follows:
1. Compute |kp1| equivalently to the steps for kp2. This has cost 5
2 ˜n + 2n2 + 4bn −2nmax(nmax + b) +
b2
4 + 7
2b −6 (this is the combined cost to evaluate the norm and then take the square root). Note that
we can apply the square root out-of-place and then reuse the calculation of |kp1|2 for the kinetic term.
