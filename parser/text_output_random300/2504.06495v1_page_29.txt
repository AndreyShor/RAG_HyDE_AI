We continue to consider ξt = ǫ αt, and we choose
α = e−11/12 ≈0.326
to guarantee β = 1 (see discussion below). The deﬁnition of Nt(φ0) in (8) is unchanged here,
just specialized to K = 2, that is,
Nt(φ0) :=
X
b∈{1,2}t
1 {φt(b) > 0} .
We claim that for the branching model just introduced we have
lim
0≪ǫ−1≪t
Nt(φa)
Nt(φb) = φa
φb
.

To justify this claim using Theorem 2, we again construct a probabilistic representation of the
branching process. For t = 1, 2, 3, . . ., let Bt be i.i.d. random variables with P(Bt = 1) = 1/2.
Deﬁne Φt = φt(B1, . . . , Bt) as before and
∆t := δt(B1, . . . , Bt).
We then approximately have ∆t ∼i.i.d. U[0, 1]. This approximation is highly accurate for
several reasons. Firstly, when p is large, the normalized values ct(b)/p are densely and nearly
uniformly distributed across the interval [0, 1]. Secondly, our use of a primitive root a en-
sures that the LCG achieves full period p −1, cycling through all integers in {1, 2, . . ., p −1}
before repeating. Thirdly, the mapping used for bt = 1 (reﬂecting the LCG value about
the midpoint) diversiﬁes branching trajectories across the tree but does not aﬀect the ap-
proximation ∆t ∼i.i.d. U[0, 1]. Finally, foundational results from number theory show that
such generators, when properly parameterized, pass standard statistical tests for uniformity
and independence. As a result, over suﬃciently long time horizons, the statistical behavior
of our deterministic model becomes eﬀectively indistinguishable from one governed by truly
uniform random multipliers.
