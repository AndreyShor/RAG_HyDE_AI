Evolutionary Step
During each generation, the GA refines the population to improve
solutions. Offspring form the bulk of the new population and are
created through crossover, where randomly selected parents are
split, recombined, and mutated. This process introduces new genetic
material, promoting diversity while preserving successful traits.
Meanwhile, elites—top-performing candidates—advance directly to
the next generation without changes, ensuring that high-fidelity
solutions remain intact. To maintain diversity and prevent early
convergence, a subset of immigrants is randomly generated and
included in the population, offering new genetic variations that
might otherwise not emerge.
Mutations then refine candidates by applying minimal changes
to their structure. In the change mutation, one quantum operation
is substituted with another of the same length, ensuring that the
circuit depth remains constant (Fig. 4). The delete mutation removes
an operation to simplify the circuit (Fig. 5), while the add mutation
introduces a new operation at a random position, increasing cir-
cuit complexity (Fig. 6). Finally, the swap mutation exchanges two
operations without altering their type (Fig. 7). This combination
of offspring creation, elite preservation, immigrant introduction,
and incremental mutations enables the GA to explore the solution
space thoroughly while retaining strong candidates for subsequent
iterations.

An experimental feature is adaptive mutation, which adjusts
mutation parameters in response to average fitness, population
diversity, and remaining generations. It encourages extensive ex-
ploration early on, then converges toward stronger solutions as the
optimization nears completion.

Island Model
The island model is an optional feature that partitions the popu-
lation into smaller, parallel subpopulations. Each island explores
different regions of the solution space in isolation. During later
generations, selective migration shares high-fidelity candidates
between islands, boosting convergence toward globally optimal
solutions. This parallel isolation also mitigates premature conver-
gence by maintaining diverse subpopulations.

Quantum Circuit Optimization
Fully random candidate creation can produce extraneous or cancel-
ing operations. To address this, the environment includes a selective
optimizer. It merges or removes redundant gates in each candidate’s
circuit (e.g., converting two consecutive T gates to an S gate) during
fitness evaluation. The best candidate also undergoes a final opti-
mization step before deployment. This selective application retains
