superconducting coherence length ξ can be estimated based on the Bc measured at T << 
Tc from the relation 𝜉𝜉= ඥФ0 (2𝜋𝜋𝐵𝐵c)
⁄
. Here Ф0 = ℎ/2𝑒𝑒 is the superconducting flux 
quantum. As shown in Fig. 4h, the Bc (defined as the field where ρxx is 50% of the ρN) 
at base temperature is approximately 0.6 T, resulting in a 𝜉𝜉≈ 23 nm. The averaging 
distance between holes at νh = 0.73 for 3.83° tMoTe2 is 𝑑𝑑ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜= √𝜈𝜈h𝑛𝑛M ≈ 6.1 nm, 
leading to 
𝜉𝜉
𝑑𝑑ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜≈ 3.8, suggesting a strong coupling of Cooper pairing. 
 
The observed magnetic switching behaviors and normal-state anomalous Hall effects 
are unusual for a superconductor. We note these peculiar behaviors align with the recent 
observed superconductivity in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene [46]. In that system, 
a superconducting state emerges within a spin- and valley-polarized quarter-metal 
phase, exhibiting similar magnetic switching behaviors and normal-state anomalous 
Hall effects as we observed. In tMoTe2, emergent ferromagnetism has been proposed 
to arise from interaction-induced valley polarization [56-61], and it is evident in optical 
measurements of 3.5° to 4° tMoTe2, across a wide range of νh from approximately 0.4 
to 1.2 [1,62]. Consequently, the observed superconductivity in tMoTe2 quite likely 
develops from a spin- and valley-polarized Fermi surface, which is consistent with the 
anomalous Hall effects observed in the normal state of superconductivity.  
  
In tWSe2, Stoner ferromagnetism has been observed at twisted angles around 2°-3° [63], 
and thermodynamic signatures of IQAH states were observed at twisted angles around 
1.3° [64]. On the other hand, superconductivity [47,48] was observed in devices with 
larger twisted angles (3.5°, 3.65° and 5°), where ferromagnetism is absent due to the 
weakened correlation effects at these larger twist angles in tWSe2. The observed 
superconductivity occurs around νh = 1 and is most prominent at finite electric fields, 
consistent with the feature of van Hove singularities (VHS). The relatively small Bc 
(~0.1 T) in tWSe2 further indicates that the pairing is likely of intervalley nature. In 
tMoTe2, single-particle band calculations reveal a VHS at νh ≈ 0.8 under D = 0, and 
shifts to larger νh with enhanced peaks at higher D (Extended Data Fig. 10), similar to 
that of tWSe2, and consistent with experimental results (Extended Data Fig. 4). While 
experimentally, the superconducting state is centered at D = 0 in tMoTe2, suggesting 
that the interplay of enhanced density of states and ideal quantum geometry may play 
a significant role, paving the way for possible intravalley pairing, which could survive 
under a relatively large B-field as observed.
