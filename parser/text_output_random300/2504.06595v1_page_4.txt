other words, the uniform shift of the framework gener-
ated by K is physically equivalent to a shift of the mobile
particle in the opposite direction. Our aim is to use the
time-local form in Eq. (2) to obtain the mobile particle’s
trajectory. First, however, we validate the time-local ap-
proximation and build intuition by performing a set of
numerical experiments using a model system introduced
in Sec. III. We then show, in Sec. IV, that we can sim-
plify Eq. (16) by replacing r →rH on the right-hand
side, leading to
r = rH −

V −1∇rU(rH, R) −KL∇R

allowing us to write down the differential equation for R
M ¨R = −∇RU(reff, Reff) ,

reff = rH −

V −1∇rU(rH, R) ,

where the last term of Eq. (17) was moved to R inside
U because it corresponds to a uniform framework shift.

MODEL SYSTEM
The aim of this section is to introduce a tractable
model system and justify our parameter choices.
Typical scales for physical quantities in solid materi-
als are meV for kinetic energies, ˚A for lengths, and ps
for times. Normalizing our system parameters by these
quantities implies a mass scale, where [m] = [E]/[v2] =
[E][t]2/[ℓ]2.
A dimensionless mass M = 1 then corre-
sponds to 1 meV ps2/˚A2 ≈9.66 Da. One of the most
common mobile ion species, Li, then has mass M ≈0.7,
and the lattice (most commonly formed from Si, Ge, S,
and P) then has mass m ≈3.5.
The simplest three-dimensional crystal is a cubic lat-
tice containing a single atom per unit cell, shown in
Fig. 1(a). A typical nearest-neighbor distance for mo-
noelemental simple cubic, bcc, and fcc lattices is about
3 ˚A, or a ≈3. This size is within the range of previous
benchmarking studies of sulfur model solid electrolytes,
with volume per atom of 20–70 ˚A3 [9]. We stress that cu-
bic lattices generally do not make good ionic conductors,
but we chose this simple geometry for demonstration pur-
poses only.
Each atom is coupled to its nearest (next-nearest)
neighbors via springs with force constants k1 (k2) so that
the dynamical matrix is

with qx,y,z = 2π [1, 2, . . . , Nx,y,z] /Nx,y,za. Keeping k2 ̸=
0 is important because, in its absence, the Cartesian coor-
dinates become decoupled, decomposing the lattice into
individual one-dimensional systems.
The highest phonon angular frequency in the system
considered here is Ωmax =
p
4k1/m + 8k2/m, corre-
sponding to the X point in the Brillouin zone. Taking
a reasonable maximum cycle frequency fmax = 5 THz,
corresponding to ≈20 meV, we have Ωmax = 2πfmax =
10π ps−1. The choice of 5 THz is on the lower end of fre-
quencies found in softer monoelemental systems or two-
element ionic conductors (such as lithium halides [28]),
picked to get a physically appropriate speed of sound.
For a reasonable value k1/k2 ≈3, we then have k2 =
5π2m ≈170 meV/˚A2 and k1 ≈520 meV/˚A2. These val-
ues translate to ≈15π ˚A/ps (≈4700 m/s) as the speed
of sound for the longitudinal phonon along the lattice’s
principal axes, a physically reasonable value. The phonon
dispersion obtained by diagonalizing Eq. (21) is given in
Fig. 1(b).
An important component of our derivation in Sec. II is
the rapid decay of the recoil kernel
↔
W in Eq. (10). For the
monoatomic lattice considered here, the 3×3 component
of this kernel coupling framework atoms j and k is
