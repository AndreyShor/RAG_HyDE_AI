Scattering Protons
(mp = 0.938 GeV) has been well known even before quarks were discovered, and can be
computed with standard quantum field theory assuming that protons behave as point-like
particles. On the other hand, already from the ’50 [37] data in the MeV region showed an
incompatible behavior with the above assumption. Surprisingly, at even higher energies, where
the inelastic scattering dominates (DIS regime) and the proton breaks up, the energy of the
final state lepton decreases, and data are again compatible with a point-like nucleon interaction.
This is the regime we are interested in and where pQCD can be used.
In the following Section 1.2.1, we show how the computation of a DIS cross-section reduces to
determining certain scalar functions describing nucleon properties. Then, in Section 1.2.2, we
illustrate a first simple model, which provides a description of the proton in terms of quarks,
introducing the concept of Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs).
1.2.1. Hadronic Structure Functions
Let us consider the following lepton-hadron scattering process
ℓ(k) + p(P) →ℓ′(k′) + X ,
(1.12)
where the brackets denote the 4-momentum associated with the particle. The scattering charged,
or neutral, leptons are assumed to be massless with kµ = (E, k) and k′µ = (E′, k′) and X is
a generic final state consisting of the proton remnants. We define the following kinematics
variables:
ν = P · q = M(E −E′),
(1.13)
Q2 = −q2 = −(k′ −k)2,
(1.14)
M2 = P 2,
(1.15)
x =
Q2
2(q · P) =
Q2
2M(E −E′),
(1.16)
y = q · P
k · P = 1 −E′
E .
(1.17)
M denotes the hadron invariant mass, while the variables x and y, called respectively Bjorken-x
and inelasticity, are two dimensionless variables bounded in the range (0, 1]. The center-of-mass
energy can be expressed from the above quantities as
s = (P + k)2 = M2 + Q2
xy ,
(1.18)
and final state invariant mass W 2 can be defined through
W 2 = (P + q)2 = M2 −Q2(1 −1
x) .
