Gap Consistency Modeling
As described in the main text, χ′′(ω) cuts integrated
over varying q-regions suggest possible gap-like behavior
in the QSL phase. The argument shown in panel (a) of
Figure 5 involves modeling χ′′(ω) curves as a weighted
sums of one DHO and one sigmoid component. These
components take forms
fDHO(ω; ω0, Γ) =
2ωΓ
(ω2
0 −ω2)2 + ω2Γ2 ,
fSigmoid(ω; a, b) = [1 + exp [−b(x −a)]]−1 .

Fits were performed using the SciPy package function
scipy.optimize.curve_fit. Common ω0 and Γ values
are found for the curves along with independent a and
b values and weights sigmoid weights. a values give es-
timates of gap energies for each curve. For Figure 10 in
Extended Data, independent DHO and sigmoid compo-
nents are used.
EXTENDED DATA
FIG. 6.
Co-alligned crystals of Zn-barlowite mounted on Aluminum plates that are affixed to the CNCS instrument sample
holder. This sample contains 0.76g of Zn-barlowite crystals mounted across three vertically stacked plates. Neutrons were
scattered off this crystal array to obtain the data reported, with the rough beam width indicated by the red circle on the plate
shown.

TABLE I. Fitted ρi values using model from Figures 1 and 4 on scattering data from Zn-barlowite and herbertsmithite with
scattering energies ℏω=0.4 meV and ℏω=1.3 meV. Bonds are labeled according to the convention introduced in Figure 4(a).
Both the signs of the correlation signals and their relative changes between the two energies are remarkably consistent between
the materials.
