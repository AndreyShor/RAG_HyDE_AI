FIG. 1: In the top panel, we plot the secret key rate of Eq. (20)
(black line) of the Gaussian modulation protocol with coher-
ent states and homodyne detection in direct reconciliation
against the loss in dB. We have optimized over the Gaus-
sian modulation variance V (grey thin line) and the PE ratio
of sacriﬁced channel uses. We have assumed N = 2 × 105,
d = 4, and pec = 0.9. The rest of the parameters are given in
Table II. We plot also the corresponding SNR (gray dashed-
dotted line). In the second panel, we plot the corresponding
values of the reconciliation eﬃciency ζ (black line), which fol-
low the same pattern as the Gaussian modulation variance
values. However, we can see that for a constant value of V
the reconciliation eﬃciency increases linearly with the loss in
dB. Subsequently, we plot the associated R∗
code (black dash-
dotted line). In the third panel, we plot the corresponding
block size (gray dashed line) after optimizing the number of
sacriﬁced channel uses during PE. We plot also the associated
leakage (black line). In the last panel, we plot Eq. (30) for
the corresponding values of the secret key rate and loss in dB.

By contrast, in Figs. 3 and 4, we plot the secret key
rates for the DR and RR protocols, respectively, against
the block size. We set the loss to 0.02 dB and choose the
other parameters in the same way. We mainly observe
that the DR protocol is advantageous in this regime of
losses: we can achieve high rates by using smaller bock-

FIG. 2: In the top panel, we plot the secret key rate of Eq. (20)
(black line) of the Gaussian modulation protocol with coher-
ent states and homodyne detection in RR against the loss in
dB. The rest of the parameters and settings have been con-
sidered the same as in Fig.
1.
Here we observe a better
performance in terms of tolerable loss compared with the di-
rect reconciliation protocol in Fig. 1. This is expected due
to the known 3 dB loss limit of the DR protocol in the ideal
asymptotic regime which decreases even more when one con-

size. Here, we consider a moderate block size roughly
105 −106. This is because we would like to investigate
regimes of operation where the high-rate performance in
long distance is not a priority.
These regimes are de-
scribed by fast sharing of small keys assuming the small-
est requirements of hardware equipment, either because
of space constraints or cost-eﬀective implementations.
For example, this can be described by QKD implemen-
tations over networks of small sensor devices, Internet
of Things (IoT) nodes, wearable devices, or drones oper-
ating inside a building, outside, connected with ﬁber or
with free-space links [63, 64].
Apart from the limitations due to the communication
links such as the noise and the losses, one should take into
account as a priority the hardware requirements of the
classical data post-processing. This can be done eﬀec-
tively, in the ﬁnite-size regime, using composable terms
connected to every performance aspect. Therefore, we
