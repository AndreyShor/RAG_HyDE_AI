QAOA
Given a depth 𝑝, mixing Hamiltonian 𝐻𝐵, and a cost Hamiltonian 𝐻𝐶, the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA) (see [1]) produces a state |𝜓(𝛽,𝛾)⟩parametrized by 𝛽,𝛾∈R𝑝as
|𝜓⟩=
𝑝

𝑚=1
𝑒−𝑖𝛽𝑚𝐻𝐵𝑒−𝑖𝛾𝑚𝐻𝐶|𝜓init⟩.
(12)
Here, the initial state |𝜓init⟩is always taken to be a separable state, i.e. |𝜓init⟩can be expressed as
|𝜓init⟩=
𝑛
Ì
𝑗=1
|𝜓𝑗⟩,
(13)
where 𝑛is the number of qubits and each |𝜓𝑗⟩is a single qubit state.
Following the convention of “QAOA-warmest” from [5], we choose 𝐻𝐵to be a seperable Hamiltonian where
|𝜓init⟩is the maximum eigenvalue eigentstate of 𝐻𝐵. This can be constructed as
𝐻𝐵=
𝑁−1
Ê
𝑗=0
(𝑥𝑗𝑋+ 𝑦𝑗𝑌+ 𝑧𝑗𝑍),
(14)
where (𝑥𝑗,𝑦𝑗,𝑧𝑗) are the bloch sphere coordinates for the (single qubit) state |𝜓𝑗⟩.
The goal of QAOA is to estimate the maximimum energy eigenstate of 𝐻𝐶by solving for 𝛽∗,𝛾∗, where
𝛽∗,𝛾∗= arg max
𝛽,𝛾∈R𝑝⟨𝜓(𝛽,𝛾)|𝐻𝐶|𝜓(𝛽,𝛾)⟩.
(15)
Assuming that the depth 𝑝QAOA ansatz is sufficiently expressive, the maximal eigenstate of 𝐻𝐶will approxi-
mately be |𝜓(𝛽∗,𝛾∗)⟩.
In fact, [5] showed that2, just like standard QAOA, if 𝐻𝐵is constructed as above (where 𝐸max is the maximum
eigenvalue of 𝐻𝐶), the following result holds,
lim
𝑝→∞⟨𝜓(𝛽∗,𝛾∗)|𝐻|𝜓(𝛽∗,𝛾∗)⟩= 𝐸max,
(16)
as long as none of the qubits in |𝜓init⟩lie at the poles of the Bloch sphere.

Encoding QUBOs and Max-Cut Problems. Given 𝑥∈{0, 1}𝑛,𝑦∈{−1, 1}𝑛and symmetric 𝑄, 𝐽∈R𝑛×𝑛, we
can construct the 𝑛-qubit states

2The theorems by [5] specifically prove this limit in the case that 𝐻𝐶is the Max-Cut cost Hamiltonian; however, by going through the
proofs, it is clear that the argument holds for any diagonal cost Hamiltonian (e.g. cost Hamiltonians that arise from classical combinatorial
optimization problems.)
