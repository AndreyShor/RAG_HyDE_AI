is concentrated in some nodes because priority is given to previously selected nodes to 
simulate the enclosure. In (c), the gift economy (C1, C2), all nodes were treated equally, 
which leads the network to expand, and in (b), the power economy (B1, B2), because 
the enclosure is mitigated, the network becomes an intermediate between (a) the market 
economy and (c) the gift economy. In (d), in the concession economy (D1, D2), the 
network is further expanded because the nodes are not bound by bidirectional edges. 
 Fig 4A1 shows the calculation results of the mean cluster coefficient 𝐶 and 
graph density 𝐷 for (a) the market economy. The horizontal axis represents the number 
of steps 𝑡, and the vertical axis represents the mean cluster coefficient 𝐶 and graph 
density 𝐷. The results of the three calculations are shown by the three blue and three 
green lines, respectively. Similarly, 4B1 shows (b) the power economy, 4C1 shows (c) 
the gift economy, and 4D1 shows (d) the concession economy. Fig 4A2 shows the 
calculation results for reciprocity 𝑅 and assortativity 𝑆 for (a) the market economy.
