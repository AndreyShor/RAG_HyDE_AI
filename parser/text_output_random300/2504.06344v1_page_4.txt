1.2.1
Overview of necessary background
This paper is driven by our desire to resolve a puzzle encountered when studying the ∆-
expansion of multi-fractional instantons [1]. To describe it even briefly, we need to introduce
a minimum amount of background, with complete detail found in the body of the paper and
the Appendices.
The starting point of the ∆-expansion are ’t Hooft’s constant commuting field strength
fractional instantons in SU(N) gauge theory on T4, with twisted boundary conditions pa-
rameterized by an antisymmetric twist tensor nµν (µ, ν = 1, 2, 3, 4), comprised of (mod N)
integers. Thus, we begin with a lightning review of
Constant-F backgrounds with Q = r/N: For definiteness, we take a T4 of periods Lµ
and ’t Hooft twisted boundary conditions with only nonzero n12 = −r and n34 = 1. Then,
the fractional part of the topological charge is Q = r/N, taking for now 1 ≤r < N. The
constant-F fractional instantons [4] are constructed by taking two arbitrary positive integers
k and ℓsuch that k + ℓ= N. Then, one defines the U(1)ω ∈SU(N) generator

Clearly, the background (1.2) has constant field strength, with only nonzero ¯F12 and ¯F34.
That the topological charge is Q = r/N can be easily verified explicitly. Furthermore, (1.2) is
self dual (and thus has minimum action

this only occurs for ∆= 0, with ∆defined for future use as4

and we consider only the case ∆> 0.5
The fluctuation spectrum around some of these
constant-F solutions was studied long ago [49], albeit not in an exhaustive manner.
As
we see below, there are features, even for the self-dual constant-F solutions, that were not
understood until now, prompted by our study of the multi-fractional instantons in [1].
3For brevity, here we skip details such as the gauge choice for the transition functions implementing the
twists and simply assure the reader that (1.2) obeys all appropriate boundary conditions on the twisted T4,
as shown in great detail in section 2.
4The self-dual constant-F solutions have a simple realization in string theory. They are T-dual to two
stacks of k and ℓD2-branes, wrapped at an angle (determined by r) on the T4, with the BPS condition being
precisely ∆(r, k, ℓ) = 0, see [47, 48].
5Because the results of [1] assumed ∆> 0. These can be trivially extended to ∆< 0, but modifications of
some formulae there are required.
