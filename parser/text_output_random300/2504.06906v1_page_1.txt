We show that a composite quantum system described by the tensor product of multiple systems
each with a leading-order exceptional point (a non-Hermitian degeneracy at which not only eigen-
values but also eigenstates coalesce) exhibits a single leading-order exceptional point, whose order
surpasses the order of any constituent exceptional point. The formation of such higher-order excep-
tional points does not require coupling among the subsystems. We determine explicitly the order
and the spectral response strength of this exceptional point. Moreover, we observe that the energy
eigenstates that do not merge are entangled. Finally, we demonstrate that general initial states
disentangle during time evolution due to the presence of the higher-order exceptional point of the
composite system.

INTRODUCTION
The time evolution of a wave system with gain and loss
is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian ˆH [1, 2],
see, e.g., for ultracold atoms in optical lattices [3], mi-
crowave billiards [4], one-dimensional nanostructures [5],
parity-time-symmetric electronics [6], compound-nucleus
reactions [7], optical microcavities [8, 9], and coupled
laser arrays [10]. Such Hamiltonians can exhibit unique
singularities known as exceptional points (EPs). At an
nth-order EP exactly n eigenenergies (eigenfrequencies)
and the corresponding energy eigenstates (modes) coa-
lesce [11–15]. This is in contrast to degeneracies of Her-
mitian Hamiltonians where only eigenenergies degenerate
while the eigenstates can be chosen to be orthogonal.
The physical existence of EPs has been demonstrated
in a wide variety of classical settings, leading to the iden-
tification of many intriguing effects with potential ap-
plications.
These include mode discrimination in mul-
timode lasing [16], EP-enhanced sensing [17–20], mode
conversion [21, 22], orbital angular momentum micro-
lasing [23], sources of circularly-polarized light [24], chi-
ral perfect absorption [25], optical amplifiers featuring
an improved gain-bandwidth product [26], and subwave-
length control of light transport [27].
While all of the above examples are classical wave
systems, there has been progress of studying full quan-
tum systems with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians by using
Hamiltonian dilation [28, 29], postselection [30–33], non-
Hermitian absorption spectroscopy [34], and Bogoliubov-
de Gennes models [35, 36]. Additionally, researchers in-
vestigated the non-Hermitian aspects and EPs of Liou-
villian superoperators generating the time evolution of
density operators [34, 37, 38].
Non-Hermitian systems with EPs very strongly re-
spond to small perturbations.
More concretely, a sys-
∗jan.wiersig@ovgu.de
tem with an EP of order n experiences an energy split-
ting proportional to the nth root of the perturbation
strength ε [11]. For sufficiently small ε, this exceeds the
linear scaling observed near a conventional degeneracy.
The strength of the response to small perturbations can
be characterized by a single measure: the spectral re-
sponse strength ξ [39, 40]. A system with a large ξ can
detect extremely small perturbations or environmental
changes, making it highly sensitive and useful in partic-
ular for sensing applications [17, 18].
The reliable fabrication of higher-order EPs is still a
challenge today. Only a handful experimental implemen-
tations are known so far, such as coupled acoustic cavi-
ties [41], photonic cavities [19, 42], high-dielectric spheres
in the microwave regime [43], nitrogen-vacancy spin sys-
tems [29], and dissipative trapped ions [34]. Proposals for
a systematic approach to achieve EPs of higher order are
presented in Refs. [44, 45]. Higher-order EPs are partic-
ularly useful for flat-top optical filters [46], EP-enhanced
sensing [19, 20], and in the context of entanglement gen-
eration [47]. The latter example is a composite quantum
system consisting of two non-Hermitian qubits. Math-
ematically, the Hilbert space of this system is a tensor
product of Hilbert spaces of the single qubits. This is
different to most of the higher-order EPs discussed in
the literature which are constructed by a direct sum.
The aim of this paper is to shine some light into the
physics of composite non-Hermitian systems. In partic-
ular, we demonstrate that the tensor product used to
combine the systems can enhance the order of EPs. We
present a theory for calculating the order of the EP and
its spectral response strength. The surprising effect of
EP-induced disentanglement is revealed.
The structure of this paper is outlined as follows. Sec-
tion II briefly reviews the essential basics of composite
quantum systems. An illustrative example is presented
in Sec. III to demonstrate some of the peculiar properties
of composite EPs. The general theory is then developed
in Sec. IV. Dynamical aspects are addressed in Sec. V
and a summary is provided in Sec. VI.
