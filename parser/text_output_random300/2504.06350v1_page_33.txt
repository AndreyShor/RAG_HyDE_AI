Figure 10: The detection efficiency η∗
A1 versus detection efficiency η obtained by equation (87) in symmetric case where A0
and B are equidistance from the source [247].
Since
p
8 −S2
0 is a monotonically decreasing function of S0, the inequality (87) implies that any amount of
loophole-free violation of the CHSH inequality between (A0, B) (S0 > 2), result in reducing the threshold
value of the CHSH expression S1.
The significance of this result depends on the assumptions underlying the derivation of the bound (87) (see
proof in [247]). Specifically, it relies on the interpretation of nonlocality and ruling out classical models in
routed Bell experiments, since the local-variable model can already be excluded by performing a simple
CHSH test between (A0, B).
The main purpose is that by observing the nonlocality in (A0, B) one
can conclude about the classicality or nonclassicality of the observed outcomes of the remote device A1.
Therefore, theorem 4 provides a convenient tool to estimate the critical parameters, (η∗
A1, v∗
A1), required
for the loophole-free certification of nonlocal correlation between (A1, B). Given a tuple of experimental
parameters (ηB, ηA0, vB, vA0), the critical parameters (η∗
A1, v∗
A1) are those that saturate inequality (87).
Considering both asymmetric and symmetric cases, if the parties share a maximally nonlocal isotropic
strategy, the following results hold:
1. Asymmetric Case: Suppose B is placed extremely close to the perfect source, such that ηB = 1,
and all devices exhibit perfect visibilities. In this scenario:
S0 = 2

S1 = 2

2ηA1.
The violation of (87) yields:

A0 = η∗
A1.
This result highlights a central insight: the closer A0 is placed to the source, the higher its effective
detection efficiency, ηA0, becomes. Consequently, the critical detection efficiency of ηA1 decreases,
allowing A1 to be placed further from the source while still retaining loophole-free nonlocal corre-
lations with B.
2. Symmetric case: (A0, B) are equidistant from the source, such that ηB = ηA0 = η and in the
presence of perfect visibility for all devices, then

Consider now a strategy where the source, Bob’s measurement device, the relay R, and the measurement
device A0 all behave as in CHSH expectations. Thus, any S0 ∈[0, 2

2] can be obtained by tuning ηA0.
For i = 0, consider the case where at some point between R and A1 (before A1) the second qubit is
measured on the basis z, yielding a binary result λ. This classical outcome is then transmitted to A1
through some purely classical channel and upon receiving it, A1 outputs it, irrespective of the input
x. Therefore, we have p(λ) = 1
