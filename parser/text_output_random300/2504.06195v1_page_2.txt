Abstract 
We present a full-spectrum machine learning framework for refractive index sensing using 
simulated absorption spectra from meta-grating structures composed of titanium or silicon 
nanorods under TE and TM polarizations. Linear regression was applied to 80 principal 
components extracted from each spectrum, and model performance was assessed using five-fold 
cross-validation, simulating real-world biosensing scenarios where unknown patient samples are 
predicted based on standard calibration data. Titanium-based structures, dominated by broadband 
intensity changes, yielded the lowest mean squared errors and the highest accuracy 
improvementsâ€”up to a 6065-fold reduction compared to the best single-feature model. In contrast, 
silicon-based structures, governed by narrow resonances, showed more modest gains due to 
spectral nonlinearity that limits the effectiveness of global linear models. We also show that even 
the best single-wavelength predictor is identified through data-driven analysis, not visual selection, 
highlighting the value of automated feature preselection. These findings demonstrate that spectral 
shape plays a key role in modeling performance and that full-spectrum linear approaches are 
especially effective for intensity-modulated index sensors.
