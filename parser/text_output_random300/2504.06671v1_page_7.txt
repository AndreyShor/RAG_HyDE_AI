It should be noted that the list of material platforms in Table 1 is not exhaustive. Other platforms, such as 
photonic qubits [40], are actively being investigated, and new candidates continue to emerge as research 
in the field advances. 
With this in mind, we focus on defect-based qubits in SiC. The first fundamental question to address is: 
What makes a defect a viable candidate for a quantum qubit? 
A key reference in answering this question is the pioneering work by Weber et al. [4] which established a 
well-defined set of criteria for defect-based qubits. This work outlines essential properties that both the 
defect and the host material must satisfy to function as a quantum qubit. A summary of these criteria is 
presented in Table 2. 
 
Table 2. Key properties of defects and host materials for defect-based qubits [4].  
Defect properties 
Host material properties 
The defect must have a paramagnetic, long-lived 
bound state with an energy splitting suitable for 
manipulation via electron spin resonance 
Wide bandgap: allows deep defect levels that satisfy 
the requirement for optical transitions. 
The defect should have an optical cycle that allows 
spin initialization via spin-selective decay. 
Low spin-orbit coupling: minimizes unwanted spin 
flips and decoherence 
The defectâ€™s fluorescence must change depending on 
the qubit state, enabling efficient optical readout. 
High-quality crystals: availability of bulk or thin-film 
single crystals to reduce imperfections and impurities.
