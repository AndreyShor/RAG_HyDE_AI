free of UV divergences [210,211]. Their work caught the attention of various physicists including
Sidney Coleman [104]. In 1971 Garry Efimov considered a non-local generalization of QED [212].
QFT and strict renormalizability. During this pessimistic period, characterized by an
increasing number of attempts to move away from renormalizable QFTs, new hopes began to arise
in the late 1960s. In 1969 John Bell and Roman Jackiw [213] and Stephen Adler [214] discovered
anomalies. In particular, they realized that the negligible value of the rate of the π0 →γγ decay
predicted by the current algebra approach [196,197] was wrong. This had to be corrected by the
chiral anomaly contribution, which turned out to be compatible with experiments, thus resolving
the Sutherland-Veltman paradox. The amazing aspect of this result is not only that QFT won
over current algebra, but also that the chiral anomaly is one-loop exact [215], so perturbative
QFT was able to provide non-perturbative information on the dynamics of pions. Moreover, the
anomalous contribution depends on the number of quarks circulating in the loop, so agreement
with experiments requires exactly three generations of quarks.
More successes were yet to come. Martinus Veltman was perhaps the only one in the 1960s who
truly believed that non-Abelian gauge theories could actually describe Nature [216,217]. Luckily,
he was very stubborn and his intuition was right. Indeed, it was his student Gerard ’t Hooft
who proved in 1971 that massless [22] and massive non-Abelian gauge theories equipped with
the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking [23] are (strictly) renormalizable. Only after
these works did the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam electroweak theory formulated in the 1960s [19–21]
began to be taken seriously. Furthermore, in 1972 it was shown that gauge anomalies cancel in
the same theory [218–220]. Thus almost all the pieces of the puzzle seemed to fall into place.
Indeed, the puzzle was completed in 1973 by David Politzer [26] and David Gross and
Frank Wilczek [27], who showed that non-Abelian gauge theories are asymptotically free, which
turned out to be the key to a QFT explanation of the Bjorken scaling [27,221,222].9 This estab-
lished QCD [24,25] as the (strictly renormalizable) QFT of strong interaction. In the same year
1973 the observation of neutral currents marked the first experimental verification of the elec-
troweak theory [227]. Since then, many other experiments have confirmed the SM predictions [1].
“Gravitational” challenge
After the SM of particle physics was formulated, the next obvious question to ask was whether
quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction could be described with the same QFT tools. It
had already been suspected that GR was perturbatively non-renormalizable since the middle of the
last century [228,229], but it was not until 1974 that Gerard ’t Hooft and Martinus Veltman [28]
performed the first complete one-loop calculation of the UV divergences. They showed that pure
Einstein’s gravity is one-loop renormalizable, but when the coupling with matter is switched
9It is worth mentioning that the negative sign of the beta function in non-Abelian gauge theories was already
known to Vladimir Vanyashin and Mikhail Terentyev in 1965 [223], Iosif Khriplovich in 1969 [224] and Ger-
ard ’t Hooft in 1971 [225,226]. However, at that time the physical implications of the result were not understood.
