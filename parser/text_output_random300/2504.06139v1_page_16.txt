When applied to boxes of the form ǫP P R + δP P R + (1 −ǫ −δ)P C for
0 < δ < ǫ < 1, which are achievable by quantum states, the protocol still
achieves distillation for some values of ǫ and δ (without crossing tsirelson’s
bound of course).
Corollary 3. There exists correlations arbitrarily close to the classical and
quantum sets of correlations that trivialize communication complexity.
The Brunner Skrzypczyk protocol brings boxes of CHSH value arbitrarily
close to 2, yet still unreachable by quantum states, and distills then to CHSH
value arbitrarily close to 4 crossing the bound Bcc deﬁned in corollary 2

Implications in Cryptography
Deﬁnition 17. An oblivious transfer (OT) protocol is a protocol in which
a sender sends a message to the receiver with probability 1/2, while himself
learning nothing of whether the receiver received the message. One out of two
oblivious transfer (1-2 OT) is a variant in which the sender holds two bits s0
and s1, and the receiver has bit c. The receiver wishes to learn bit sc without
the sender learning c.
Wolf and Wullschleger [21] gave a protocol for secure 1-2 OT. Their pro-
tocol uses a single PR-box and proceeds as follows. Alice inputs x = x0 ⊕x1.
Bob inputs y = c. Alice gets output a and Bob b. Alice sends m = x0 ⊕a to
Bob. Bob computes m ⊕b = x0 ⊕a ⊕b = x0 ⊕(x0 ⊕x1)c = xc.
Wolf and Wullschleger’s protocol for 1-2 OT is secure, but when trying the
usual reduction from OT to 1-2 OT, it becomes insecure. In the reduction,
the sender uses sk = b and s¯k = 0 with k ∈R {0, 1} the receiver uses any
c ∈{0, 1}. The players perform 1-2 OT with sk, s¯k and c, then the sender
announces k to the receiver who learns b with probability 1/2 if k = c. Using
their protocol, the receiver can delay his input into the box until the sender
announced k and always learn b.
Buhrman et al. [7], based on the Wolf and Wullschleger protocol, showed
that bit commitment and OT are possible given perfect PR-boxes.
The following deﬁnition will be of use in the bit-commitment protocol
described in Buhrman et al.
Deﬁnition 18. Let the operator |x|11 for a bit string x denote the number
of substrings 11 of x starting at odd positions (with positions starting at 1).
| · |11 is deﬁned recursively as follows
