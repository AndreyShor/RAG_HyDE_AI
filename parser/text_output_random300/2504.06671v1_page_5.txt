A qubit remains in its superposition state as long as it is not measured or disturbed by its environment. 
However, upon measurement, the superposition collapses, and the qubit assumes one of its basis states, 
either ∣0⟩ or ∣1⟩, with probabilities determined by ∣α∣2 and ∣β∣2. This phenomenon, known as wavefunction 
collapse, is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and plays a crucial role in quantum computation 
and information processing [30].

Different physical systems are currently used as qubits. The most known are presented in Figure 3 and 
briefly described as follows: 
i) 
Superconducting Qubits: 
Superconducting qubits are one of the most developed and widely used platforms for quantum 
computing. These qubits are based on superconducting circuits that exhibit quantum behavior. Materials 
like niobium and aluminum are commonly used in these circuits due to their low resistance at cryogenic 
temperatures. Superconducting qubits offer fast operation and scalability, but they are sensitive to noise 
and require ultra-low temperatures for operation, typically in the millikelvin range [31, 32]. 
ii) 
Trapped Ions: 
Trapped ion qubits are individual ions confined by electromagnetic fields and controlled using laser-based 
techniques. Commonly used materials include calcium ions (Ca⁺), barium ions (Ba⁺), and ytterbium ions 
(Yb⁺). The internal states of these ions, such as electronic or hyperfine states, serve as qubits. Trapped ion 
qubits are known for their long coherence times and high-fidelity gate operations. They are ideal for 
quantum simulations and algorithms, but the main challenge is scalability due to the need for precise laser 
control and individual ion manipulation [33,34].
