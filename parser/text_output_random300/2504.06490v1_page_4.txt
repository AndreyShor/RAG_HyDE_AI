FINITE AMPLITUDES - UV AND IR
SUBTRACTION
The infrared and ultraviolet singularities of our scat-
tering amplitudes are manifested in terms of poles in the
dimensional regulator ϵ. The poles of an amplitude at nth
order are described by the following universal formula in
terms of its lower order counterparts such that we can
define a finite remainder AF
X.

Above, αR
S and C0,R are the renormalized strong cou-
pling and Wilson coefficient respectively, the operator
ZαS and ZC0 implement the usual MS ultraviolet renor-
malization of the strong coupling constant and the effec-
tive operator of eq. (1) using the QCD β-function [112–
117] and the infrared singularities are subtracted by the
universal factor Z(αS(µ2), {pi}) [118–125].

Above,
Γcusp refers to the cusp anomalous dimen-
sion [123], which is currently known exactly through four-
loop order [126, 127], and approximately at five loops
[128]. Furthermore, γR
c is the collinear anomalous dimen-
sion, obtained through four-loop order in refs. [127, 129].
The above formula was derived and calculated through
three-loop order in ref. [118] and verified in N = 4 super
Yang-Mills theory [130] and QCD [131–133]. In ref. [125],
its general structure was determined to four-loop order.
The term ∆(αS(µ2), {pi}) is known as the correction of
the dipole formula and starts at the three-loop order. We
refer, for example, to Section 5 of ref. [134] for further de-
tails.
We use the above definition of finite amplitudes to cre-
ate a finite interference with the tree level amplitude.

Finite interfered amplitudes like in the above equation
are the ingredients directly feeding into the computation
of scattering cross sections. We provide the finite inter-
fered amplitudes for all external particle configurations
in the scattering and in the decay region in ancillary files
together with the arXiv submission of this Letter.

The central region of the plot is away from any infrared
logarithmic enhancement and displays excellent pertur-
bative stability for three-loop corrections.
VALIDATION
We performed a range of validations to ensure that our
computation is correct.
1. Eq. (10) describes the poles in the dimensional reg-
ulator of an amplitude based on lower loop ampli-
tudes. The fact that our newly computed three-
loop amplitudes satisfy this structure is a very
stringent test.
2. The two-particle collinear limit of scattering ampli-
tudes is described by universal splitting amplitudes,
which were recently computed in ref. [135] to third
loop order and we validate our results in this limit.
3. The limit of scattering amplitudes of one gluon hav-
ing almost vanishing energy is described by a uni-
versal soft current, which was recently computed in
ref. [134, 136] to third loop order and we validate
our results in this limit.
4. We find that the leading transcendental part of the
M(3)
H→ggg amplitude corresponds [137] to the so-
called tr(ϕ2) form-factor in N = 4 super Yang-
Mills theory [53–56]. We reproduce this form fac-
tor based on an integrand from ref. [56] through
