4. Conclusions and Discussion
To conclude, computations of the Casimir-Polder interaction using the Lifshitz the-
ory are sometimes made outside the region of its applicability and, speciﬁcally, at
too short atom-plate separations, where the plate material cannot be considered
as a continuous medium. To justify such an approch, the physically well grounded
application regions of both the short- and long-range Casimir-Polder potentials es-
tablished by the founders of the Lifshitz theory, are revised by disregarding the
atomic stricture of a plate material.
The claimed “excellent accuracy” of the analytic expression for the dielectric
permittivity of Si used in computations of the Casimir-Polder interaction is incorrect
because the imaginary part of this permittivity is negative over the wide frequency
and temperature ranges in violation of the second law of thermodynamics.
Finally, computations of the van der Waals (Casimir-Polder) interaction at sep-
arations below a few nanometers should be performed not by means of the Lifshitz
theory but, e.g., by the methods of molecular dynamics accounting for the atomic
structure of a plate material.
