COMPARISON OF FROBENIUS ALGEBRA STRUCTURES ON CALABI–YAU TORIC HYPERSURFACES

For simplicity of notation, we write L = (ℓ1, · · · , ℓm) and ˜L = (ℓ0, ℓ1, · · · , ℓm) below. In order to compute
τ, we consider a lift of the cocycle in the Poincar´e regular sequence
ηL := u(z)v(z) det(ρL)c
zLΩs
fLfs

where we refer to [12, Corollary 7.1] for the notation V β and [12, Corollary 7.2] for the underlying idea;
it gives res(ηL) =

|L|=m. Using this we can compute the coboundary map (as in
the proof of [12, Proposition 11.1]) by [12, Corollary 7.2, (10)]

Now without loss of generality one can take I = {1, · · · , m}. Then let UI be the covering associated
to V (f, z1f1, · · · , zmfm) = φ ⊆P, i.e., given by U0 = {f ̸= 0} and Ui = {zifi ̸= 0} for i = 1, · · · , m.
This covering makes sense because of the result of Cox [5, Proposition 5.3] (see [12, Proposition 3.2] for
the form we use), since X is assumed to be a non-degenerate ample hypersurface in P. Moreover, [12,
Proposition 3.2] says that
J0(f) = ⟨f, z1f1, · · · , zmfm⟩.
Now let us write (3.5) relative to the covering UI using the non-trivial Euler relations; we follow [12,
page 115] to compute as follows

By the deﬁnition (3.4), we have

τ(ω) = (2πi)m TrP(τ(ω))

we obtainZ

where the last equality follows from [12, Corollary 6.1]. Note that we use the fact that (3.3) is independent
of I and det(ρ1| · · · |ρm) = det(ρI). Thus we conclude that TrLG((−1)bu · v) = R
X φΩ(u) ∪φΩ(v).

3.3. Transport of formal Frobenius manifold structures. We brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition of Frobe-
nius manifolds and formal Frobenius manifolds.
Deﬁnition 3.8 (Frobenius manifolds). A Frobenius manifold is a tuple (M, ◦, e, E, g) where M is a
complex connected manifold with metric g, ◦is a commutative and associative OM-bilinear multiplication
TM × TM →TM, and e is a global unit vector ﬁeld with respect to ◦, subject to the following conditions:
(1) (invariance) g(X ◦Y, Z) = g(X, Y ◦Z),
(2) (potentiality) the (3, 1)-tensor ∇g◦is symmetric where ∇g is the Levi-Civita connection of g,
(3) the metric g is ﬂat, i.e. ∇g is a ﬂat connection, [∇g
X, ∇g
Y ] = ∇g
[X,Y ],
(4) (ﬂat identity) ∇ge = 0.
One can similarly deﬁne a formal version of Frobenius manifolds by considering the formal structure
sheaf and the formal tangent bundle instead of the holomorphic structure sheaf and the holomorphic
tangent bundle.
