I(JP) = 0(1+) from different approaches. The columns show in order the spread in the predictions from different works, typically with
much smaller individual uncertainties, for phenomenological models, QCD sum rules, lattice QCD employing static QQ potentials and
lattice QCD employing NRQCD for the heavy quarks.
appear as near threshold bound or virtual states that qualify as hadronic molecules, but even wide resonances such as the f0(500) which has
a mass of the same order of magnitude as its width can fall into this class (see the discussion in 7).
To provide some general understanding under what conditions the scattering of two particles of mass m1 and m2 that feel an attractive
force develops a pole near threshold, we may study a zero range interaction—this is justified as soon as the de Broglie wave length connected
to the bound system is significantly larger than the range of forces. Then the scattering amplitude at tree level in momentum space is given
by a constant and we get for the loop expansion of the scattering amplitude in non-relativistic kinematics [8]

where FΛ(q) is some regularisation function and Λ the regularisation scale.
For FΛ one may either chose a sharp cut off, FΛ(q) =
θ(πΛ/2 −q), or a Gaussian cut-off or employ more sophisticated methods like the so-called power divergence subtraction [55] (for a
detailed discussion see Ref. [56]). Here µ = m1m2/(m1 + m2) denotes the reduced mass of the external particles. The condition for the
appearance of a near threshold pole in the amplitude may thus be expressed as
C−1 = −Π(−EB) = µ
2π (−Λ + γ) + O(Λ−1) ,
(11)
with the binding momentum γ =

2µEB, where EB = m1 + m2 −mB with mB for the mass of the studied bound state. Formally the scale
Λ is not an observable and needs to be absorbed into the coupling strength C. However, as soon as one would introduce more dynamics
into the potential, Λ would acquire a physical meaning like, e.g., the mass of the lightest exchange particle. Thus the appearance of a near
threshold pole is controlled by some interplay of the binding potential, the masses of the external particles and the binding momentum. For
m1 ≈m2 we have µ ≈m2/2 and for m1 ≪m2 we have µ ≈m1. Thus we deduce that it is more natural for doubly heavy systems to generate
bound states than for singly heavy ones, since in the former case already a rather weak attraction (|C| small) leads to a bound state.
The renormalised scattering amplitude, where Λ is absorbed into C, takes the simple form

also independent of the detailed dynamics that lead to the appearance of the pole. In fact, shallow bound states develop some universal
properties—for a review see Ref. [57].
The discussion above applies to purely dynamically generated states. The equations were generalised by Weinberg [58] (inelastic
channels were later included in Ref. [59]). The study starts from a two component wave function of a bound state interacting via some
