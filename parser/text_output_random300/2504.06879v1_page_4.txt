U2 = V2 −D2[e−2α2(r−r2) −2e−α2(r−r2)],

where U0 represents the short-range interaction, U1 represents the intermediate range, including the Coulomb
interaction, and the third term U2 used in an inverted form to account for the long decay tail of Coulomb at large
distances, describes the scattering behaviour of charged systems. X1 and X2 represent the boundary points for the
3 Morse function defined at three different regions.
To ensure the smoothness of the potential at these boundary points, the functions and their derivative must be
continous at X1 and X2. That is:
Ui|Xi = Ui+1|Xi

where i takes values 1 & 2.
Each Morse function consists of four parameters- V, D, α, and r. Thus, the reference potential includes a total of 14
parameters, including X1 and X2, which need to be optimized. By applying four boundary conditions, four of these
parameters can be determined, reducing the number of free model parameters to 10. Consequently, the reference
model represents a family of curves defined by ten adjustable parameters. These relationships between variables
maintain consistency and reduce the number of free parameters in the model. These parameters are optimized
using the Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) paradigm through inverse scattering, employing the variable
phase approximation.

Phase Function Method:
In order to solve the inverse scattering problem, the Phase Function Method (PFM) offers a straightforward and
effective method for reconstructing the unknown potential from scattering data. In PFM, the Schrodinger equation(a
linear homogeneous equation of the second order) [23], is reformulated into a first-order non-linear Riccati equation,
which evolves with the radial coordinate and directly relates the scattering phase shifts to the potential [24]. At
each point, the phase equation represents the scattering phase shift corresponding to the potential, providing insight
into the influence of different regions of the potential.
The Schrodinger wave equation for a spinless particle with energy E and orbital angular momentum ℓundergoing
scattering is given by
