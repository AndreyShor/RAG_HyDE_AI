Theorem 9. Let G be a XOR-game. Then
ωQ(G) −τ(G)
ωC(G) −τ(G) ≤KG
where KG is Grothendeick’s constant.
Grothendeick’s constant KG is the smallest number such that, for all
integers N ≥2 and all N × N real matrices M, if

for all unit vectors |u1⟩, . . . , |uN⟩, |v1⟩, . . . , |vN⟩in Rn for any n.
The exact value of Grothendieck’s constant is not known, but it is known
to satisfy

Finally, the coming result upper bounds the maximum quantum winning
probability by a function of the maximum classical winning probability.

Non-local Computation
Consider the scenario in which Alice and Bob wish to distributively compute
a function whose input is also distributed. Alice and Bob respectively receive
bit strings x and y and they must output single bits a and b such that
a ⊕b = f(x ⊕y). What is particular in this type of non-local game is that
neither of the players learn anything about the input since the individual bits
of x and y are uniformly distributed from Alice and Bob’s perspective.
