Figure 9: The above figures show the numerical plots of the mutual information (the top panel) and the concurrence
(the bottom panel) with two freely falling UDWs as a function of the proper distance of detector A from the event
horizon on a constant Painleve-Gullstrand time slice (x-axis) while keeping the distance between two detectors at the
peak of Gaussian switching and all other parameters fixed. In the plots, the black line represents the Unruh state, the
red line represents the Hartle-Hawking-Israel (HHI) state, and the purple line represents the Boulware state. Here, the
two-point function corresponding to the preserving conformal symmetry in the coupling frame is taken. We keep Ω= 2σ
in all cases.
From Figs. 3, 9, and 10, it is evident that the qualitative behavior of mutual information and concurrence in each
of these three vacuum states are quite similar. In particular, we do not observe any decay in correlation measures near
the horizon. This observation suggests that the decay near the horizon, observed in subsection 4.2.2, is due to high
gravitational acceleration. In Fig. 10, we have plotted the mutual information and concurrence with two-point functions
W HHI
ψ,f
defined in (24), W Unruh
ψ,f
defined in (32), and W Boulware
ψ,f
defined in (37). One observes in Fig. 10 that both the
mutual information and the concurrence are maximum for the HHI vacuum, while they attain their minimum values for
the Boulware vacuum. This ordering can be understood by the enhancement of correlations due to the dominance of the
anti-Hawking effect in the HHI state far from the horizon (see Fig 5). This ordering differs to that observed in Fig. 3 and
Fig.9 with conformal symmetry obeying two-point functions W HHI
ψ,c defined in (18), W Unruh
ψ,c
defined in (26) and W Boulware
ψ,c
defined in (33). The ordering pattern is the same for both small and large-scale initial separations. Such a behavior
can be attributed to the fact that the freely falling detectors need to traverse through the field “bath” (need not be a
thermal bath), and in the case of the Unruh vacuum, there is only an outgoing flux of radiation [13; 86]. Meanwhile,
in the HHI vacuum, there are both ingoing and outgoing fluxes of radiation (need not be thermal). This difference in
radiation fluxes immediately leads to more entanglement disruption in the HHI vacuum. It’s important to highlight that,
while keeping the peak of detector A very close to the horizon, the detector does spend some time beyond the horizon
due to the long tail of the Gaussian switching function. However, as evident from the plots for both the Unruh and HHI
