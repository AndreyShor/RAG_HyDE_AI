We find that if the applied IDC value is smaller or greater than Is for a choice of ν, we get a reversal of sign
in rDMR. To put it simply, for a B|| value (+300 mT < B|| < −300 mT) we can cross over from positive
(negative) to negative (positive) rDMR as we change applied D.C. bias current from IDC < Is to IDC > Is
as demonstrated in ∆dVxx
dI (B||, IDC) 2−d colormaps in SI-Fig.s 9b and f before the collapse of rDMR at a
higher bias current (IDC > 50 nA). At the optimal doping of νop = 2.7, we don’t see any sign of hysteresis
(∆dVxx
dI
≈0; SI-Fig. 9d) below a bias current of ∼30 nA, in line with the observations already described
in the main text. Once SC region starts transitioning to the normal state with increasing D.C. bias current,
i.e., dVxx
dI
> 0, we see a hysteresis phase emerging at the optimal doping, the nature of which is switched for
IDC > Is, where Is ≈38 nA for ν = 2.7.

plotted as a function of applied IDC with increasing T from 20 mK
to 1 K for D = 0.00 V/nm at ν values of a) 2.2, b) 2.7, and c) 3.2. Dashed vertical lines are at IDC values
of 0, 21.60 nA, 36 nA, and 45 nA. dVxx/dI increases with increasing T but the behavior reverses (dVxx/dI
decreases with increasing T) at a sufficiently higher value of IDC defined as Is. The Is values for the three
filling factors are ∼14 nA (ν = 2.2), ∼41 nA (ν = 2.7), and ∼23 nA (ν = 3.2).
Now, how do we understand such switching of the nature and the sign in rDMR (or rMR) with
increasing IDC. As discussed in the main text (Figure 5) the continuous change in the magnetic field might
lead to an induced non-monotonous change and hysteresis in the local temperature profile of the sample
stage (and sample) in the forward and backward magnetic sweep, and depending on the nature of Rxx vs.
T, at a given ν, the sign of rMR is determined. When dRxx
dT |ν > 0, Rxx(ν) increases with increasing T, and
we get positive (negative) ∆Rxx for negative (positive) B|| (see Figure 3 in the main text). On the contrary,
if dRxx
dT |ν < 0, Rxx(ν) will decrease with increasing T, and we should get negative (positive) ∆Rxx for
negative (positive) B||.
