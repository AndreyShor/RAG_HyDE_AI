The higher Jc in the AN sample is attributed to a greater fraction of the stoichiometric
Nb3Pt phase alongside the Nb-Ti phase. Another possible contributor to the high Jc
is the magnetic ﬂux pinning provided by impurity phases (e.g., Ti2Zr, β-NbZr, Pt-Zr)
within the matrix. The magnetic ﬂux pinning mechanism is analyzed in Figs. 25(c) and
(d). The ﬂux pinning force of the AN sample is one to two orders of magnitude higher
compared to the other samples. The functional form of the magnetic ﬁeld dependence
of the ﬂux pinning force is shown to be dependent on the annealing conditions. This
suggests that the pinning mechanism may vary from sample to sample. The authors
employed the Dew-Hughes model, expressed as fp(h) = A1hx1(1 −h)y1 + A2hx2(1 −
h)y2. The ﬁtting parameters obtained for the AN sample are x1 = 0.5, y1 =2, x2 =
0.5 and y2 = 1. The ﬁrst term corresponds to the surface normal pinning model, while
the second term represents the magnetic normal pinning model[64].
7 Comparison of Jc among diﬀerent HEAs including
Nb-Ti alloy
Table 1 summarizes the fundamental superconducting properties, microstructural fea-
tures, and the presence of lattice strain in representative HEAs discussed in this
review. Figures 26(a) and (b) exhibit the comparison of Jc among selected HEAs
at 2 K and 4.2 K, respectively. The thin-ﬁlm form of Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6
generally enhances Jc at low ﬁelds[49, 73]. If the high-ﬁeld performance of Jc can
be substantially improved, thin-ﬁlm HEAs hold promise for practical applications.
Hereafter, the focus shifts to bulk HEAs. The overall magnetic ﬁeld performance
of Jc in as-cast or SPS-processed Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6[61, 71] is relatively
inferior compared to heat-treated Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6, (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5,
and NbScTiZr[54, 55, 74]. As shown in Table 1, the as-cast and SPS-processed
