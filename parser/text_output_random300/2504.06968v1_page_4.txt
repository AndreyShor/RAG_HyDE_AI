extracted the spectra by performing a different selection of the time windows for the background
spectrum computation (see methods subsection Background). The narrow emission feature re-
mains clearly visible in these finer time intervals. In the four finer time-resolved spectra (8 −21 s,
11 −24 s, 14 −27 s, 17 −30 s), the ∆AIC values vary between 25.76 −36.55, the ln(BF) ranges
from 2.06 to 7.34, and the ∆χ2 ranges from 18.53 to 34.49. These results further strongly favor
adding an additional narrow emission feature (see methods subsection Model comparison). The
comprehensive results of the spectral analysis for these four time intervals are presented in Table 1.
The temporal evolution of Gaussian component parameters is presented in the (f), (g), and (h) pan-
els of Figure 1. Notably, the central energy Egauss of the narrow emission feature remains constant
at around 2.1 MeV, while the width σgauss shows a possible decreasing trend over time. The flux
of the narrow emission feature is approximately 10−6 erg cm−2 s−1.
Significance analysis. In order to assess the significance of narrow emission features, we cre-
ated 1.00 × 107 simulated data assuming the Band model and fitted them with both the Band and
Band+Gaussian models to obtain the distribution of ∆χ2. Table 2 shows the chance probability
values (p-valuesim) calculated based on the results of 1.00 × 107 simulations. We also consid-
ered the p-valuesim corrected for the number of independent search trials (p-valuesim-trial). The
highest statistical significance of narrow emission features was observed in the time interval C
(8 −30 s), with the chance probability value p-valuesim < 1 × 10−7 obtained from results of
1 × 107 simulations, corresponding to a Gaussian-equivalent significance > 5.32σ. Considering
the correction for the number of independent search trials, the chance probability value decreases
to p-valuesim-trial < 2.56 × 10−5, corresponding to a Gaussian-equivalent significance > 4.20σ (see
methods subsection Significance calculation of narrow emission feature). The chance probability
values for the other time intervals are shown in Table 2.
Comparison with GRB 221009A. The spectral analysis of GRB 221023A reveals a marginally
statistically significant narrow emission feature at around 2.1 MeV. This would then represent
the second event following GRB 221009A with a narrow emission feature in the MeV energy
range. In the case of GRB 221009A, the central energy Egauss of the narrow emission feature
decreases over time (about 37 MeV to 6 MeV), while the ratio of the line width to the central
energy is nearly constant (about 10%) 22,23. For GRB 221023A, we observe the trend: the central
energy Egauss remains steady at around 2.1 MeV throughout the observation period, while the
width σgauss exhibits a possible decreasing trend as time progresses, the flux of the narrow emission
feature is around 10−6 erg cm−2 s−1. The Figure 4 displays the lightcurves of GRB 221009A and
GRB 221023A within the energy range of 0.2−40 MeV. The shaded regions indicate time intervals
in which narrow emission features were detected. The narrow emission feature in GRB 221023A
appears during the rising and falling phases of the brightest pulse, with a duration of 22 s (time
