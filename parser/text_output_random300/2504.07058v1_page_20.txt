The analytic solution to this model, as presented in [1] (though with different boundary conditions), is given by
exp(−𝑡) sin(𝜋𝑥). The source term is:
exp(−𝑡) sin(𝜋𝑥)

𝛾𝜋4 + 𝜋2 −2 + exp(−2𝑡)(sin(𝜋𝑥))2
.
Figure 12 shows a graphical comparison between the approximate solutions obtained using PINN and the exact
solution. The results demonstrate that the PINN-based approximation closely matches the exact solution, validating
its stability. Furthermore, Fig. 17a illustrates the variation in tumor cell density over time 𝑡. Table 4 presents the
relative error E𝑟
𝐺and training error E𝑇, along with the selected hyper-parameters.

1D extended Fisher–Kolmogorov equation
Consider the EFK equation:
𝑢𝑡+ 𝛾𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥−𝑢𝑥𝑥+ 𝑢3 −𝑢= 0,
(𝑥, 𝑡) ∈[0, 1] × (0,𝑇],
(3.12)
with initial and boundary conditions:
(a) 𝑢(𝑥, 0) = 𝑥3(1 −𝑥)3,
(b) 𝑢(𝑥, 0) = 𝑥2(1 −𝑥)2,
𝑢(0, 𝑡) = 0,
𝑢(1, 𝑡) = 0,
(3.13)
𝑢𝑥𝑥(0, 𝑡) = 0,
𝑢𝑥𝑥(1, 𝑡) = 0.
(3.14)
The numerical solution for this equation has been computed using the parameter 𝛾= 0.01 with different initial
values. Figure 11a shows the numerical solution for the initial condition 𝑢(𝑥, 0) = 𝑥3(1 −𝑥)3, while Figure 11b
corresponds to the initial condition 𝑢(𝑥, 0) = 𝑥2(1 −𝑥)2. Both figures display the numerical solutions at different
times, exhibiting the same characteristics as those presented in [42]. Table 5 reports the training error E𝑇alongside
the chosen hyperparameters.
