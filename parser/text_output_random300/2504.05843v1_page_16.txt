At this point we have transformed the original loop integral over one four-momentum into a parametric
double integral. Did we make progress, though? One-dimensional MB integrals can often be computed exactly,
but already the simple looking expression for I1 resists naive attempts on integration. Yet, as the Γ function
exponentially decays in the imaginary direction the method does allow for a fairly stable numerical evaluation
of Feynman integrals [28]. However, if straight line contours are desired, their positions along the real axis
must be so arranged that they run between Γ functions with positive and negative sign, respectively, of the
MB parameters zi. This may necessitate jumping over a singularity and thereby extracting some residues.
The result is a sum over — partially lower-dimensional — MB integrals. For planar Feynman integrals the two
most commonly applied strategies for fixing reals parts are realised in the packages MB.m [28] and MBresolve.m
[13], where the latter can be uploaded into the former.
Next, we turn to the double box. Mellin-Barnes representations can be built loop-wise: we send the bottom
point to infinity also for the double box, thereby amputating the two propagators attached to it. We could
substitute the MB representation (6) for the remaining three propagators attached to the left vertex in the
right panel of Figure 1, and take the product with the two propagators on the top right and on the right
of the graph.
The process described in the opening paragraphs of the Section is then repeated.
The six
point permutations of (6) generate six slightly inequivalent-looking four-parameter representations for the full
two-loop integral, cf. [9]. Picking residues of four simultaneous contour integrals can be cumbersome — there
will usually be several series of residues, cf. the MBconicHulls.m package [21] — whereas the otherwise very
efficient barnesRoutines.m [20] does not spot ways to apply Barnes’ lemmata to integrate any of the four MB
parameters out of these six representations.
An alternative is to put together all five propagators in a single step employing five Feynman parameters,
and generating one common denominator
q1x2
15 + q2x2
26 + q3x2
56 + q4x2
35 + q5x2
36 .

Successively integrating over both (dual) loop-momenta (ie. the positions of the two vertices) the integral
representation
I2 =

dq1 . . . dq5 δ(1 −P

U(q1 . . . q5) f(q1 . . . q5, x2

13, x2

(95)
is obtained, where U and f are the famous Symanzik polynomials. At first glance this looks hardly helpful:
U has six terms and f even nine, so to split both into monomials we apparently need the astounding number
of 13 MB parameters. Nonetheless, appealing to a trick [29, 19, 30] we will only need seven. What is more,
barnesRoutines.m will be able to integrate out five of these, leading to a two-parameter representation looking
like a higher-transcendentality analogue of (6).
To this end we may split the parameters into the groups {q1, q3, q4} and {q2, q5}, respectively. This partition
has a graphical origin: the propagators 1/x2
26, 1/x2
36 associated with q2 and q5, respectively, are not connected
to the left vertex in the right panel of Figure 1. This can be used to simplify the Symanzik polynomials,
the structure of which is also closely associated with the Feynman graph. Now, in one of the partitions the
integration range for the parameters is extended from [0, 1] to [0, ∞], upon which they can be scaled out of
the δ function [19, 30]. We choose q2, q5 as these Cheng-Wu variables upon which we can put
q1 + q3 + q4 →1
(96)
in the polynomials. Then
U = q3(q1 + q4) + q2 + q5
(97)
and
f = q1q2q3x2
12 + q1(q2q4 + q3q4 + q3q5 + q4q5)x2
13 + q2(q3q4 + q5)x2
23 .
(98)
The idea is now to decompose f into monomials introducing six MB parameters, which we will do from the
back to the front. The U polynomial is treated differently: we can use the formula
Z ∞
0
dq qm(q + A)n = A1+m+n Γ[1 + m]Γ[−1 −m −n]
Γ[−n]
(99)
to eliminate the Cheng-Wu variables {q2, q5} in favour of Γ functions. Having done so, the remainder of the
U polynomial unfortunately still counts two terms, namely q3(q1 + q4), which we split introducing a seventh
MB parameter. In a final step, equation (93) can be used to integrate out {q1, q3, q4} resulting into a seven-
parameter MB representation.
