SUPPLEMENTARY DISCUSSIONS
Spatial Resolution of the Experimental System
In this section, we discuss the spatial resolution of our microscopy system. Figure S7
shows a photoluminescence (PL) map of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. The left
map, acquired at room temperature, exhibits a full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.5
µm. Given that the beam waist for a 515-nm laser is approximately s × 0.6 µm (assuming
NA = 0.82 and s = 2/π for the full-width 1/e2 and s = 1.18/π for the full-width half max-
imum), this FWHM is close to the diffraction-limited value. In contrast, a low-temperature
measurement, performed on a different diamond sample, shows a FWHM of 1.1 µm, possi-
bly due to vibrations of the dilution refrigerator and variations in excitation power between
measurements. These results indicate that our microscopy system can focus the 515-nm
laser nearly at the diffraction limit, ruling out the possibility that the laser beam waist is
broader than expected.
Figure S8(a) shows the result of the laser-scanning microwave spectroscopy at Area3,
FWHM = 0.5 μm
FWHM = 1.1 μm
FIG. S7. Photoluminescence (PL) maps of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. (Left) Room
temperature measurement with a full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.5 µm; (Right) low-
temperature measurement at 15 mK with a FWHM of 1.1 µm. Different diamond samples were
used: a nitrogen-vacancy center inside a solid immersion lens (SIL) for the room temperature ex-
periment, and a nitrogen-vacancy center in bulk diamond for the low-temperature experiment.
