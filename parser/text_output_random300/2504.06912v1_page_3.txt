out of the integration, replacing it with its value at x∗.
In the non-singular sub-intervals, the integral itself,
I(ω, x), is slow-varying and can be approximated by
usual integration routines which require discretizing the
interval. In doing so, it would be beneficial to choose the
size of the sub-intervals to be δ so that the singular sub-
interval is naturally accounted for in the partitioning of
the integration interval [a, b).
For definiteness, we will use the Riemann sum as the
conventional prescription. Therefore, if we break the in-
tegration into N equal sub-intervals of size δ, we can
write
χ(ω)

where (x0, xN) = (a, b), ¯xm is a point in the sub-interval
[xm−1, xm) chosen according to some given prescription
(e.g., the mid-point of the interval) and m∗is the index
corresponding to the singular sub-interval.
Next, note that for non-singular sub-intervals
I(ω, ¯xm)δ =
I(ω, ¯xm)
s(ω, ¯xm −x∗)s(ω, ¯xm −x∗)δ
= R(ω, ¯xm)s(ω, ¯xm −x∗)δ

Sm(ω) ≡S(ω,xm) −S(ω,xm−1)

where the functional S is the integral of s(x). The last
line uses the fact that in a non-singular sub-interval, even
s(ω, y) is slowly varying, allowing us the replace sδ with
an integral of s over the interval of size δ.
We thus see that we can express the integral over the
entire interval as a weighted sum of the modified-residue
over all the sub-intervals. That is,
χ(ω) ≈χmRes(ω) ≡
N

m=1
R(ω, ¯xm)Sm(ω)

s(ω, ¯xm)Sm(ω).

This is what we call the modified-residue (mRes) pre-
scription.
In practice, I(ω, ¯xm) would be the sample points that
are numerically made available to us that we need to
integrate over. More often than not, unfortunately, the
m-mesh is not fine enough to successfully deploy the Rie-
mann sum (RSum) prescription to integrate over the sin-
gular nature of I(ω, x) [which would mean approximating
χ(ω) with χRSum(ω) = P
m I(ω, ¯xm)δ]. However, if we
knew the asymptotic singular form s(ω, x−x∗), we could
compute S(ω, x) analytically. Then, using its definition
in Eq. (5), we can evaluate Sm(ω) and deploy Eq. (6) to
estimate χ(ω). As is evident from this construction, for
a fixed N, χmRes should perform the same as χRSum in
the non-singular sub-intervals and improve on it in the
singular sub-interval, rendering an overall improvement
in the former’s performance.

γB2g(θ) = sin(2θ). The meaning and relevance of these
terms and symbols are not relevant at this stage (but
will be elaborated on in the next section). It suffices to
know that they just give us access to different scenarios
where the applicability of the mRes prescription can be
demonstrated.
Equation (7) represents a common scenario in many-
body physics problems: we need the integration over a
variable (here θ), but the integrand I(ω, θ) itself is a re-
sult of a different, and potentially involved, numerical
calculation. Thus, the availability of I(ω, θ) for different
values of θ is usually limited. To use our prescription,
we would need to know the resulting singularity after
performing the 1D integration.
For this demonstrative example, the 1D integration is
