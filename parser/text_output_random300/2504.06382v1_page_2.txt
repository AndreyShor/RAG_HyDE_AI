Introduction
Energy functionals describe the mechanical deformations of surfaces immersed in M3 and
have relevant applications in physics and biology. For example, the Willmore energy, used
as a model for red blood cells and lipid bilayers, like vesicles, is defined for a closed smooth
2–dimensional surface Σ with genus g embedded in R3. In the context of gravitational
physics, energy functionals play a central role in capturing key geometric and physical
properties of embedded surfaces.
For example, in 1973, Penrose [1] claimed that in any asymptotically flat spacetime
which contains a black hole, the total mass is always bounded below by
p
A/16π, where A
is the area of its event horizon. This result assumes a series of global properties of Einstein
spaces, which are closely related to the Cosmic Censorship conjecture. Cosmic Censorship
states that the formation of spacetime singularities is possible only if there is an horizon
that protects them. Therefore, the proof of the Penrose inequality (PI) is an open problem
of utmost relevance within the framework of gravitational collapse. In that respect, it was
later shown by Huisken and Ilmannen [2] that PI holds for the case of a single black hole with
