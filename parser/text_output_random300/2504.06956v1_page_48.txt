The joint Laplace functional
The main goal of this section is to prove Proposition 2.17 which is the main input for the proof
of the stable convergence result Theorem C. The main ingredient in the proof of this theorem is
Proposition 6.1 below, which will be proved separately in Section 7. The key idea for the proof is to
split the field X into two independent scales, namely Xs and Xs,t, for 0 ≤s < t. The former field
has strong local interactions, while the latter one has a strong independence structure. In particular,
as we will see, the exponential of the field Xs,t macroscopically behaves like an independent stable
random measure that will integrate the exponential of the field Xs, thus generating the desired limiting
measure.
This section is organised as follows. In Section 6.1, we introduce several definitions and state
Proposition 6.1, which plays a fundamental role in the proof of Proposition 2.17. In Section 6.2,
assuming Proposition 6.1, we establish the convergence of the “small scales” while conditioning on
the “large scales”. In Section 6.3, we prove the “full” conditional convergence. Finally, in Section 6.4,
we show how Proposition 2.17 follows directly from the results obtained thus far, and we also prove
Theorem C.

Setup and preliminary results
For the reminder of this section, we fix γ >
√
2d. For n ∈N, we consider a collection of fields
(Wi,t)i∈[n],t≥0 satisfying (W1) – (W4). We recall that we need to prove that for all (φ, (fi)i∈[n]) ∈
C∞
c (Rd) × (C+
c (Rd))n, the following limit holds

where we refer to the statement of Proposition 2.17 for the definitions of all the quantities involved.
To simplify the presentation, we assume that the functions (fi)i∈[n] are all of the form fi = θi1[0,1]d
for some non-negative constants (θi)i∈[n] ⊆R+
0 . The proof developed below works in the general
case where (fi)i∈[n] ∈(C+
c (Rd))n, with minor and straightforward adjustments. In particular, in the
general setting, the unit box [0, 1]d can be replaced by any compact set that contains the supports of
all the functions (fi)i∈[n].
With a slight abuse of notation, for all t ≥0, it is convenient to introduce the function Fγ,t : Rd →R
and the quantity Tγ ≥0 given by

where Ψ denotes the field introduced in Definition 2.7, which, as stated in Proposition 2.13, has a
law independent of λ ∈Λ, where Λ is the set introduced in Lemma 5.1. For this reason, we omit the
subscript λ when referring to the field Ψ.
In this way, assuming that the function (fi)i∈[n] are as specified above, we need to prove that the
following limit holds

In order to prove (6.2), we introduce a decomposition of the unit box [0, 1]d as follows. For R ≥1,
we consider s ≥0 such that (es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N, and we write
[0, 1]d =
