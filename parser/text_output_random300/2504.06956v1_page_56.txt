where we used the fact that Xu is Fsn-measurable since by assumption u < sn. On the one hand,
Lemma 6.7 implies that the following convergence holds almost surely

On the other hand, the martingale convergence theorem implies that the following convergence holds
almost surely

(6.20)
Therefore, since the right-hand side of (6.19) coincides with the right-hand side of (6.20), we obtain
that uniformly over u ≥0, it holds that

Thanks to the dominated convergence theorem and the fact that Xu converges to X as u →∞almost
surely in H−κ(Rd), one has
lim
u→∞E
hexp(i⟨X, φ⟩) −exp(i⟨Xu, φ⟩)

and the conclusion follows.
We now show how the proof of Theorem C follows directly.
Proof of Theorem C. Thanks to Lemma 3.8, it suffices to show that the following joint convergence
in distribution holds in H−κ
loc (Rd) × (M+(Rd))n for some κ > 0,
(X, (µγ,t,i)i∈[n]) ⇒(X, (µγ,i)i∈[n]) .
By Lemma 3.4, it suffices to verify that for all (φ, (fi)i∈[n]) ∈C∞
c (Rd) × (C+
c (Rd))n, it holds that
lim
t→∞E

exp(i⟨X, φ⟩)



Furthermore, by Proposition 2.17, it suffices to establish that
E

exp(i⟨X, φ⟩)

i=1
exp(−µγ,i(fi))


(6.21)
where, as before, to simplify the notation, we have omitted the dependence of Tγ on (fi)i∈[n].
Recalling the definition of the collection of measures (µγ,i)i∈[n] given in the statement of Theorem C,
one can use formula (3.5) to check that
E
 n
Y
i=1
exp(−µγ,i(fi))
 σ(X)

= exp(−ea⋆µγc(Tγ)) ,
thus yielding (6.21), which completes the proof.

Proof of Proposition 6.1
The main goal of this section is to prove Proposition 6.1, and it is structured as follows. In Section 7.1,
we introduce some notation and state Lemmas 7.2 and 7.4, which are the two main technical lemmas
used in the proof of Proposition 6.1. We then show how the proof of Proposition 6.1 follows from the
two aforementioned lemmas and Propositions 4.1 and 4.2. The remaining part of the section is then
devoted to the proof of Lemmas 7.2 and 7.4. In particular, in Section 7.2, we prove Lemma 7.2, while
in Section 7.3, we prove Lemma 7.4.
