CPTP maps in Deﬁnition 3, i.e. Λ2 : Am →BmKm and Λ3 : E →E′ at γm. Let UΛ2 : Am →BmKmE and
UΛ3 : E →E′E′′ be the corresponding Stinespring dilation isometries of Λ2 and Λ3, respectively. Alice applies UΛ2
and UΛ3 to m copy of the state ρAR as follows
|τ2⟩BmKmERmR′m
= (UΛ2 ⊗11RmR′m) |ρ⟩AmRmR′m
,
|τ3⟩BmKmE′E′′RmR′m
= (UΛ3 ⊗11BmKmRmR′m) |τ2⟩BmKmERmR′m
,
where |ρ⟩AmRmR′m
is a puriﬁcation of (ρAR)⊗m, and systems Rm and R′m are held by inaccesible reference systems.
Then Alice and Bob perform Schumacher compression on k copies of τ BmKmE′E′′RmR′m
3
to send systems BmE′ from
Alice to Bob, assuming that the systems KmE′′RmR′m are held by a reference. The rate of this protocol is equal to
S(BmE′)τ3 + ηk. Moreover, this asymptotic protocol preserves the ﬁdelity with k copies of τ BmKmE′E′′RmR′m

)⊗k, υBmkKmkE′kE′′kRmkR′mk) ≥1 −ǫk,
(13)
where (υBmKmE′E′′RmR′m)⊗k is the decoded state of Schumacher compression, and ηk and ǫk converge to 0 as k
converges to ∞. More precisely, in Schumacher compression we can choose ǫk = ( log |BmE′|
o(
√
k)
)2. From Remark 4, we
obtain the bound |E′| ≤(|A| · |B| · |K|)2m, hence, the error can be bounded as
ǫk ≤(2m log |A| · |B|

At the last step of the proof, we will take the limit m →∞. Therefore, to have vanishing error in the limit of k →∞,
we may choose m = k

Tracing out systems E′kE′′kR′mk only increases the ﬁdelity, hence, we obtain
F((τ BmKmRm
