friction Reynolds number Re𝜏, boundary layer thickness 𝛿, and the dimensions of the computational domain
𝐿𝑥× 𝐿𝑦× 𝐿𝑧. Based on the attached-eddy model, key structural properties are determined, including the
hierarchical level number of vortex packets 𝑁𝑝in (2.6), the height of individual hairpin vortices ℎ( 𝑗)

(2.7), population density 𝑀𝑖in (2.8), and spanwise meandering Δ𝑧𝑖in (2.11). These parameters define the
centerlines of the wall-attached eddies. Next, the vorticity field of the hairpin vortices is constructed based
on their centerlines, circulation strengths Γ( 𝑗)

in (2.10), and core size distribution 𝜎( 𝑗)

in (2.5). Finally, the
velocity field of the synthetic wall turbulence is obtained by applying the Biot–Savart law along with wall
and bulk flow corrections in (2.12).
and dominate the outer layer, highlighting the influence of large-scale outer-layer structures
over near-wall turbulence characteristics.
2.3. Construction method of flow fields
To satisfy the no-penetration condition at the wall, we construct hairpin vortices directly
on the wall, and introduce symmetric virtual vortices in the mirror space relative to the
wall. The influence of the wall is modeled through the induced velocity of these virtual
vortices within the computational domain. The vorticity field is assembled by summing
contributions from all hairpin vortices, following (2.3), using a numerical algorithm that
transforms Cartesian coordinates 𝒙into (𝑠, 𝜌, 𝜃). This approach has proven highly robust,
producing a smooth vorticity field even in cases of complex vortex tube interactions, including
self-intersections (Shen et al. 2024). The fluctuating velocity field is then computed from
the vorticity via the Biot–Savart law in Fourier space. To better resolve the wall flow, we
interpolate the data onto a non-uniform grid based on Chebyshev polynomials (Wang & Yang
2024).
In our approach, the induced velocity field of the constructed eddies ˜𝑈, along with an extra
uniform bulk velocity ¯𝑈= 1, directly determine the wall-normal distribution of the turbulent
velocity profile
𝑈= ( ˜𝑈+ ¯𝑈)(1 −exp (−𝑦/𝐴)).

Note that a van Driest-type damping function is introduced to enforce the no-slip boundary
condition, where the constant
