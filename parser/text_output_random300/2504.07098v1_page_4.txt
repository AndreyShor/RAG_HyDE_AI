assuming c1,2 −a1,2, c1,2 −b1,2 /∈Z≤(we denote Z≤the set of nonpositive integers). The detailed derivation of this solution
is given in Appendix B. These solutions generalize to the nonhermitian case the solutions derived in Ref. 26. The asymptotic
behavior of the functions F1,2 is summarized in Table I. If either c1 −a1 = c2 −a2 ∈Z≤or c1 −b1 = c2 −b2 ∈Z≤, the
solutions of the hypergeometric equation become more complicated, since some of the hypergeometric functions become linearly
dependent or ill-behaved for x →±∞. We will not address these cases explicitly in this work.
The solutions φs
1,2(x) simplify in the cases where |vL,R| = v or mL,R = m or if the fields are uniform, as shown in Table I
of Ref. 26. Since the functions F1,2 are bounded or diverge polynomially, as summarized in Table I, the exponents α±
L and α±
R
uniquely determine the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. Hence, the existence of zero modes, i.e., particular solutions that
are normalizable and satisfy the boundary conditions on a given interval, is uniquely and solely determined by the exponents
α±
L and α±
R. Since these exponents only depend on vL,R, mL,R, one can infer that the values of the fields at large distances and
the boundary conditions univocally determine the existence and number of zero modes and their pseudospin s on infinite and
semi-infinite intervals.

NONHERMITIAN BULK-BOUNDARY CORRESPONDENCE
A.
Topological invariant
In hermitian systems, the bulk-boundary correspondence [6–8] establishes a relation between the number of topologically
protected modes at the boundary between two topologically inequivalent phases. For uniform and hermitian fields m(x) = m ∈R,
v(x) = v ∈R, one can define the topological invariant W ∈Z2 characterizing the Hamiltonian as W = sgn(v) for m ≤0
and W = 0 otherwise [28]. Hence, assuming uniform fields at the asymptotes x →±∞, the phase on the left x ≪−w has
topological invariant WL = sgn(vL) if mL ≤0 and vL ̸= 0, and WL = 0 otherwise. Analogously, the phase on the right x ≫w
gives WR = sgn(vR) if mR ≤0 and vR ̸= 0, and WR = 0 otherwise (see Refs. [4, 28]). The number of topologically protected
zero-energy modes localized at the boundary is equal to the difference between the values of the topological invariant on the right
and on the left of the boundary ∆W = |WL −WR|.
Here, we want to generalize the bulk-boundary correspondence to nonhermitian systems, particularly to nonhermitian systems
described by nonhermitian modified Jackiw-Rebbi equations as in Eq. (1). These nonhermitian systems can be seen as an
adiabatical "deformation" of the conventional hermitian systems. Hence, the bulk gap of the hermitian Hamiltonian is transformed
into a line gap in the nonhermitian case [14]. We will define here a topological invariant for these nonhermitian Hamiltonians
by an adiabatic deformation of the topological invariant in the hermitian case, justified by our analysis of the decay rates of the
localized boundary modes solutions of the Jackiw-Rebbi equations in Eq. (1).
