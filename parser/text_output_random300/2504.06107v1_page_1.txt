We investigate doubly-charmed hexaquark states within the diquark picture, by employing the
constituent quark model and the quark-interchange model as our theoretical frameworks. Using the
Gaussian expansion method, we systematically study these states, with calculating various properties
such as mass spectra, internal contributions of each Hamiltonian component, root-mean-square radii,
and two-body strong decay widths. Our analysis of the mass spectra reveals no stable state in this
system. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radii suggest that the doubly-charmed hexaquark states
exhibit a compact configuration. By examining the decay widths, we identify potentially detectable
states and their primary decay channels within each subsystem. Despite the large decay phase space,
we still find narrow states with total widths of less than 10 MeV. This study provides a theoretical
foundation for understanding the structures and interactions of doubly-charmed hexaquark states
and offers valuable insights for future experimental searches.

INTRODUCTION
In the field of hadron physics, the study of exotic
states beyond conventional mesons (q¯q) and baryons
(qqq) has been a central research focus [1–5]. A pivotal
breakthrough occurred in 2003 with the Belle collabora-
tion’s discovery of the X(3872) [6], ushering in an era of
rapid progress.
Subsequent experiments by Collabora-
tions such as LHCb, BaBar, Belle, and BESIII have un-
veiled a spectrum of unconventional hadronic states, in-
cluding the Pc/Pcs pentaquarks [7–10] and charmonium-
like XY Z states [11–16]. These discoveries have moti-
vated extensive theoretical efforts to elucidate their in-
ternal structures, exploring configurations such as com-
pact tetraquarks, molecular states, hybrids, and glueballs
[17–19].
Although the hidden-charm sector has dominated this
landscape, recent observations of the doubly-charmed
baryon Ξ++
cc (3621) [20, 21] and the tetraquark candi-
date T +
cc(3875) [22, 23] by LHCb have shifted attention
to the double-charm sector. This raises intriguing ques-
tions: Could doubly-charmed pentaquarks exist, anal-
ogous to their hidden-charm counterparts?
Moreover,
what about doubly-charmed hexaquarks?
The latter,
as a six-quark system, brings computational challenges
due to the complexity of its inherent six-body problem.
Current theoretical studies often adopt approximation
methods. For example, Liu et al. investigated the mass
spectra of these systems using the chromomagnetic in-

teraction (CMI) model [24]. Complementary to this ap-
proach, the one-boson-exchange potential model has been
employed to examine hadron-level interactions and pre-
dict the properties of doubly-charmed hexaquarks within
the framework of two-body molecular states, as demon-
strated in Refs. [25–31]. Further insights have emerged
from exploratory lattice QCD calculations, which address
the binding characteristics of these systems [32]. While
these efforts provide valuable insights, the reliance on di-
verse approximations underscores the necessity for novel
methodologies to resolve persistent theoretical ambigui-
ties and deepen our understanding of hexaquark dynam-
ics.
A promising framework to simplify such systems is the
diquark model [33–35], proven effective in hadron spec-
troscopy.
For example, many observed charm baryons
are bound states of a charm quark and a light di-
quark (qq), with λ-mode excitations explaining their
spectra
[36–39].
The model has shown unique value
in studying multi-quark states with other configura-
tions—for instance, in the compact diquark-anti-diquark
(diquark+diquark+antiquark) configuration, it offers an
effective way to investigate hidden-charm and hidden-
bottom XY Z exotic states [40–42] (like Pc, Pcs states
[43, 44]). When extended to the doubly-charmed hex-
aquark system (a six-body system), it can be approxi-
mated as a four-body system of two charm quarks and
two light diquarks. By “freezing” the diquarks’ internal
degrees of freedom, this simplification reduces computa-
tional complexity while preserving key physical features,
akin to charm baryon treatments.
Notably, this framework suggests a structural paral-
lel between the T +
cc(3875) tetraquark (composed of two
charm quarks and two light antiquarks) and a hypothet-
ical doubly-charmed hexaquark. Replacing two light an-
