Figure 9. Sensitivity analysis of (a, c) the mean velocity and (b, d) Reynolds stress profile to variations in (a, b)
the core variation coefficient (𝐶𝜎= 0.1, 0.3, 0.5) and (c, d) the circulation coefficient (𝐶Γ = 1.5, 2.0, 2.5).
Reference data from DNS at 𝑅𝑒𝜏= 1000 are shown as squares (mean velocity) and circles (Reynolds
stresses). Corresponding predictions from the SWAT model are represented by red lines (mean velocity)
and blue lines (Reynolds stresses).

To illustrate these contributions, we consider a representative SWAT at Re𝜏= 1000. Fig-
ure 10(a) separately displays the contributions to statistics from three self-similar hierarchies
and their aggregated effect, which collectively captures the logarithmic behavior within the
log region. Subsequently, the incorporation of the superstructure hierarchy yields a velocity
defect profile that closely corresponds with the DNS data in the outer region, as illustrated
in figure 10(b). The cumulative summation of these components closely reconstructs the
velocity defect profile, confirming the additive nature of these structures in shaping the mean
