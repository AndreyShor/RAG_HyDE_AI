where 𝑀1 is the number of interior points of 𝑖. 𝑀2 denotes the number of points located on the inner and outer
boundaries of 𝑖, while 𝑀3 exclusively indicates the number of points placed on the outer boundaries of 𝑖. 𝑀4 is the
number of sensors located in the computational domain to measure the velocity values, sparsely. 𝑀5 is similarly defined
for the temperature and pressure. Obviously, 𝑀1 + 𝑀2 = 𝑁. In this study, we use a fixed value for 𝑀1, 𝑀2, 𝑀3, 𝑀4,
and 𝑀5 and over all 𝑖. Note that while 𝑀1, 𝑀2, 𝑀3, 𝑀4, and 𝑀5 could conceptually vary from one point cloud to
another, 𝑁has to be fixed over all 𝑖. The solutions obtained by PI-KAN-PointNet are shown by (̃𝑢, ̃𝑣, ̃𝑝, ̃𝑇), whereas
the ground truth obtained by a numerical solver, lab experiment, or analytical solutions are indicated by (𝑢, 𝑣, 𝑝, 𝑇).
The PI-KAN-PointNet loss function is specified as a combination of the residuals introduced above summed over all
𝑉𝑖(1 ≤𝑖≤𝑚). We indicate the automatic differentiation operator by 𝛿computed using the PyTorch software [111].
In line with the definition of the inverse problem in Sect. 2, the corresponding loss function () is expressed as:
= 1

+ 𝑟energy

+𝑟temperatureouter-BC

+ 𝑟temperatureobs
𝑖
).

Note that no boundary condition is specified for the pressure in the loss function (Eq. 30).
