for small Q2 and x = 2 × 10−3. The IHOUs are correspondingly sizable at low scale, and in fact
always larger than the difference between the NNLO and aN3LO results except at the highest
x values and the lowest scales, implying that for the charm structure function aN3LO may be
more accurate, but possibly not more precise than NNLO.
An analogous study of perturbative convergence of the inclusive structure function is shown
in Fig. 4.14 (note the different scale on the y axis). Interestingly, the effect of the aN3LO
corrections changes sign when going from x = 2 × 10−4 to larger values of x. In general, N3LO
corrections are smaller at the inclusive level: specifically, aN3LO corrections to the inclusive
structure function are below 2 % for Q2 >∼10 GeV2, and at most of the order 10 % around the
charm mass scale. The impact of the IHOUs on the heavy coefficient is further reduced due to
the fact that charm contributes at most one quarter of the total structure function. Consequently,
the aN3LO correction to the NNLO result is now larger than the IHOU in a significant kinematics
region. This, together with the fact that aN3LO corrections are comparable or larger than typical
experimental uncertainties on structure function data, motivates their inclusion in a global PDF
determination.
4.2.3. N3LO corrections to hadronic processes
N3LO corrections to the total cross-section for inclusive NC and CC DY production [281, 282]
are available through the N3LOXS public code [278], both for on-shell W and Z and as a function
of the dilepton invariant mass mℓℓ. Differential distributions at the level of leptonic observables
for the same processes have also been computed [288, 289], but are not publicly available. No
N3LO calculations are available for other processes included in the NNPDF4.0 dataset.
