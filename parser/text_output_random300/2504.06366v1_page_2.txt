Abstract 
We investigate the temporal evolution of ocean heat uptake efficiency (OHUE) using 
observations and large ensemble model simulations. OHUE, defined as the ratio of the rate in 
ocean heat uptake to changes in global mean surface temperature anomalies, has exhibited 
significant variability over recent decades. We found a relatively low OHUE in the late 1980s, a 
peak around 2000, and a subsequent decline. A key finding is the significant influence of natural 
external forcing, mainly volcanic eruptions, which causes an abrupt decline in OHUE followed by 
a gradual recovery. The 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, a major volcanic event of the 20th century, 
had a lasting impact on OHUE. This study emphasizes the contribution of mid-latitudes to global 
OHUE changes. Our findings underscore the importance of considering natural external forcing in 
understanding climate dynamics and suggest conducting idealized experiments to quantify the 
potential effects of future volcanic eruptions on OHUE. 
 
Plain Language Summary: We examine how efficiently the ocean has been absorbing heat from 
the Earth's surface to slowdown the global warming over the past few decades. We found that the 
efficiency has varied over time, showing a notable increase following the 1991 Mount Pinatubo 
volcanic eruption, peaking around the year 2000, and then declining. Our analysis of observations 
and climate model simulations indicates that natural events like volcanic eruptions significantly 
influence how much heat the oceans absorb. We identified that the mid-latitude regions play a 
crucial role in driving these variations. Additionally, the Southern Ocean has become less efficient 
at absorbing heat into the ocean interior ocean in recent periods. These findings emphasize the 
importance of considering natural external forcing in climate studies to improve the accuracy of 
future climate predictions. 
 
 
 
1 Introduction 
The ocean plays a central role in regulating the Earth’s climate by absorbing more than 90% of 
the excess energy caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (Cheng et al., 2017; Rhein 
et al., 2013). The extent to which these processes efficiently sequester heat from the ocean surface 
partially determines the rate of surface warming. Ocean Heat Uptake Efficiency (OHUE, W m⁻² 
K⁻¹), defined as the rate of ocean heat uptake per degree of change in the global-mean surface 
temperature (Gregory & Mitchell, 1997; Raper et al., 2002), is critical in moderating the pace of
