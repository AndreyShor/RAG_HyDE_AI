Abstract: We present results for the Drell-Yan process pp →Z/γ∗+ X →l+l−+ X in
the presence of the rapidity dependent jet vetoes TBj and TCj. These observables provide
a tighter veto at central rapidities than at forward rapidities. Our predictions contain a
resummation of large logarithms of the veto scale over the hard scale, matched to fixed
order in perturbation theory; we present results at both NLL′+NLO and NNLL′+NNLO.
Uncertainty estimates are provided that contain both resummation and fixed-order uncer-
tainties; we find that using a standard profile scale variation procedure for the former seems
to underestimate the uncertainty, particularly at NLL′+NLO. Consequently, we modify the
procedure to avoid cancellation of scale variations between partonic channels, and verify
that the uncertainties from this method are reasonable using a simplified version of the
Theory Nuisance Parameter (TNP) method. We then find that the uncertainty decreases
going from the NLL′+NLO to the NNLL′+NNLO predictions, and obtain an uncertainty at
the level of 1 −3% in the NNLL′+NNLO predictions when the veto scale is of O(10 GeV).
