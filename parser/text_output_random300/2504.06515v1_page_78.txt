9. The Circular N-Body Problem
Thus far, the discussion has been concerned with lineal topology. For non-relativistic
gravity, this is the only option. The OGS equations (4) for a general potential V are
V′′
=
4πGm δ(x −z(t))
(219)
˙p

−V′(z)

for a single particle. The ﬁrst equation implies V = 2πGm|x|, which has a vanishing
derivative at x = 0 and yields p = z = 0 as a consistent single particle solution. However, if
the topology is circular, then both V(L) = V(−L) and V′(L) = V′(−L) for some L, where
2L is the circumference of the circle. These matching conditions have no solution unless
another point source of negative mass is introduced. For N bodies modelled as compact
smeared sources, the problem remains: the potential grows linearly with the increasing
distance from the source(s) and the matching conditions cannot be satisﬁed for physically
reasonable (i.e., positive mass) sources.
However, the ROGS, being in a dynamical space–time, does not suffer from this
problem, since the space–time can expand or contract in response to the presence of sources.
It is possible to solve the canonical equations of motion and obtain both single-particle [127]
and exact N-body static equilibrium solutions [128,129]. This latter solution corresponds
to a space–time that expands/contracts in response to N equal mass bodies at equidistant
proper separations from one another. These are the ﬁrst N-body dynamic equilibrium
solutions in any relativistic theory of gravity.
The action is still given by (10), but the extrinsic curvature K in (17) is now taken to be
a time coordinate τ(t). This allows the elimination of π from all canonical ﬁeld equations.
The reduced canonical action (22) instead becomes

where now

which is the circumference functional of the circle when ˙τ is constant. The N-body system
is now time-dependent. The spatial metric can be chosen so that γ = γ(t), as in general
relativity on (2 + 1)-dimensional spatially compact manifolds [130]. The Hamiltonian will
be time-independent if a time parametrization is chosen so that ˙τ√γ is constant.
Equilibrium solutions correspond to a situation in which all particles are motionless at
various points around the circle. Consequently, they are characterized by ˙za = 0 = pa, and
so the canonical ﬁeld Equations (49)–(54) become [128,129]
