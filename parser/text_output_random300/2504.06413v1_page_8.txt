Kölle et al.
The rising demand for automated circuit synthesis and opti-
mization in NISQ hardware motivated this research. By examining
various mutation strategies and their interactions with quantum cir-
cuits, we provided empirical data that highlight both the strengths
and limitations of GA-based approaches. Our flexible environment
and comprehensive dataset represent a main contribution of this
work, enabling systematic GA evaluations and offering a resource
for further improvements in quantum circuit optimization.
Hardware constraints limited the number of experiments we
could conduct. Although we aimed for thorough testing within
these constraints, longer trials and larger populations may provide
deeper insights. While the findings may not have immediate large-
scale effects, identifying potential improvements in the rapidly
evolving quantum computing field could lead to significant long-
term impact.
Future investigations could explore larger quantum systems, big-
ger populations, and direct comparisons with alternative optimiza-
tion methods. Further refining adaptive mutation schemes, perhaps
by integrating dynamic heuristics, may also improve convergence
speed and performance. We hope that these results encourage ongo-
ing research into evolutionary algorithms for quantum computing,
thereby advancing more efficient and fully automated quantum
algorithms.
