Condensation term C = γ(q −qs)H(q −qs)/τ, shown over one horizontal wavelength. The top
panel shows C for the full vertical domain, and the bottom panel shows a zoom of C around the LCL of
the environment, where the impact of the linear instability on the basic state is most pronounced. The cyan
and magenta line mark the LCL and LFC of the environment respectively (with the dashed lines marking the
basic state values). The grey arrows show the velocity (u, w). The results are shown for the parameter values:
RHsurf = 0.6, bsurf = 0.05 and r = 1 × 10−5 and Ra = Rac = 7.80 × 105.
instability stems from this region of the domain.

Approximate Dispersion Relationship for Highest Frequency Modes
The eigenvalue spectra shown in Figure 7 revealed the presence of damped oscillatory
modes. Oishi and Brown (2024) assumed that the oscillatory modes are dry Boussi-
nesq internal gravity waves, and examined the associated eigenvector structure of
the modes to obtain an estimate for the moisture modified internal gravity waves.
We also assume the waves are dry internal gravity waves, but use a different vertical
wavenumber estimate motivated by the structure of the b and q eigenvectors.
The highest frequency normalised eigenvectors shown in Figure 11. The buoy-
ancy and humidity eigenvectors are trapped below the LCL, in the unsaturated region
of the domain. The imaginary part shown by the dotted lines corresponds to a tilt of
the modal structure.
Recall that the dispersion relationship for Boussinesq internal gravity waves is
given by,
ωr =
Nbkx
p
k2x + k2z
,
then we can get an approximate dispersion relationship for ωr by estimating Nb and
kz. We estimate the Brunt–V¨ais¨al¨a frequency by Nb = ∂b/∂z(z = 0), where b is the full
buoyancy field. The structure of the b & q eigenvectors motivate choosing a vertical
