different sizes (580 and 1075 data points). A sine-cosine representation for phase values and Euclidean 
normalization within the network architecture enable our model to handle the phase wrapping 
discontinuity problem and learn essential mathematical and physical constraints. The network 
achieves accurate prediction despite the small size of imbalanced datasets and the challenging 
behavior of phase, with consistent R² values 0.928 for Dataset A and 0.906 for Dataset B. It achieves a 
mean angular error of 0.114 radians (approximately 6.5°) for Dataset A and 0.124 radians 
(approximately 7.1°) for Dataset B. The physical constraints embedded in the network architecture 
restrict the solution space to physically valid predictions, improving generalization with limited data. 
This approach is extendable to other photonic structures and could be modified to incorporate 
additional physical constraints for different applications.
