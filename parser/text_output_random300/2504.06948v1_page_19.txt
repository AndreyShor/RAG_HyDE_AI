Thus, we have
∥|x′
l⟩−|x(T)⟩∥2 ≤∥|x(T)⟩−|xl⟩∥2 + ∥|xl⟩−|x′
l⟩∥2 < ϵ,
∀l ∈S.
Furthermore, by Lemma D.3, we have
γ′
l ≥γl −ϵ′ ≥

10c√mg .
Therefore, if we measure the index register of |x′⟩in the standard basis, the probability of getting outcome
l ∈S is
X
l∈S
|γ′
l|2 ≥
81p
100c2mg2 =

and when this occurs, the state of the value register becomes |x′
l⟩, which is ϵ-close to the desired state |x(T)⟩
in l2 norm. Using amplitude amplification [8], we can raise this probability to Ω(1) with O(g) repetitions of
the above procedure.
In summary, the query complexity is

.
Finally, the total gate complexity is multiplied by the query complexity along with the gate complexity for
block-encoding, as given in Theorem III.8.

COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS METHODS
In this section, we compare our method with two other approaches: the method based on Taylor ap-
proximation [7, 13, 32] and the method based on linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) [2],
which achieves near-optimal dependence on all parameters. First, we compare the theoretical query com-
plexity of the three methods. Then, we conduct numerical comparisons between our method and the Taylor
approximation-based method in two distinct scenarios.
• Scenario I: For a given desired precision ϵ and a fixed approximation order k, we compare the smallest
values of m required by both methods to achieve the condition ∥bx−x(T )∥2
∥x(T )∥2
< ϵ.
• Scenario II: For a given desired precision ϵ and m = ⌈∥AT∥2⌉, we compare the smallest approximation
order k required by both methods to achieve the condition ∥bx−x(T )∥2
∥x(T )∥2
< ϵ.

Theoretical comparison
We use the result from [13] as the theoretical query complexity for the method based on Taylor approxima-
tion. In [13], an oracle OA is used to compute the non-zero entries of A. However, in our setting, we assume
the availability of a (α, d)-block-encoding of A, denoted as UA. To make their results and ours comparable,
we modify their setting accordingly. In this modified setting, their algorithm requires
