tonian with arbitrary (not rational) energy level ratios.
In this case, the resolutions of the identity (28) and (30)
are no longer exact and the time states do not provide
an overcomplete basis for the system. Nevertheless, since
any real number can be approximated with arbitrary pre-
cision by a ratio between two rational numbers, the resid-
ual terms in the resolutions of the identity and conse-
quent small corrections can be arbitrarily reduced.

Limit in discretizing time
As in the previous Section we search here the rela-
tivistic limit in discretizing the time values considering
z + 1 > rp as ﬁnite. The spacing between neighboring
time values is here:
δτ = τm+1 −τm =
T
z + 1
(31)
where for T , from (23), we can derive the following key
relation:
T =
2πℏrn
En −E0
.
(32)
Equation (32) must be valid for each n and, in particular
for n = p, leading to
T =
2πℏrp
Ep −E0
(33)
where the amplitude of the energy spectrum Ep −E0
appears explicitly in the denominator.
Combining now equations (31) and (33), we obtain:
δτ =
2πℏrp
Ep −E0
1
z + 1.
(34)
The fundamental inequality is obtained again by requir-
ing that (half) the diameter of the clock lC be not be
smaller than its Schwarzschild radius, namely
Ep −E0 < lC
2
c4
2G,
(35)
which, together with (34), leads to
δτ lCc4
4G > 2πℏrp
z + 1
(36)
and ﬁnally to
δτlC > 8π
rp
z + 1lptp.
(37)
Given the number of time states z + 1, equation (37)
shows that the limit in the discretization of time values,
depending on the physical size of the clock lC. As in the
previous section, this bound on δτ can be made arbitrar-
ily small by choosing z+1 > rp arbitrarily large. Further-
more, also in this case, under the condition T > 8πlptp
(which is easily satisﬁed), equations (31) and (37) ensure
that we can safely take the limit z →∞, in which time
becomes continuous. Indeed, while δτ tends to zero, the
constraint on δτ also tends to zero (with the same scal-
ing), and δt always remains above the bound.
C.
Limit in resolving time
We brieﬂy discuss here the limit in time accuracy,
working again in the limiting case z →∞. The main
part of the discussion is essentially the same as that al-
ready covered in paragraph II.C and therefore we won’t
repeat it. The only diﬀerence with respect to the previous
Section is that, in this case of the generalized quantum
clock, we no longer have a set of orthogonal time states.
Thus we resort to the Margolus-Levitin bound [26] to es-
timate the time interval ∆t⊥required for the state (29)
to evolve into an orthogonal conﬁguration. We have [27]:
∆t⊥≥max
 πℏ
2 ¯E , πℏ
2∆E

(38)
where ¯E = ⟨ˆH⟩and ∆E is the spread in energy of the
clock given by ∆E =
q
⟨( ˆH −¯E)2⟩.
Considering now that ¯E, ∆E ≤Ep −E0, together with
equation (35), we can ﬁnd a ﬁrst bound for ∆t, namely:
∆tlC ≥∆t⊥lC > 2πlptp
(39)
which is consistent with what we found in the previous
Section through equations (11) and (14). We notice that,
by assuming again lC ∼c∆t as proposed by SW, equation
(39) becomes: ∆t > (2π)
1
2 tp.
As mentioned, when considering the relativistic SW
framework, the second bound on ∆t can be directly ob-
tained by applying the discussion developed in the pre-
vious Section, leading to
∆t > 2
1
3 T
1
3 t
2
3p
(40)
which turns out to be a general limit, independent of the
structure of the clock’s energy spectrum.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we studied the relativistic limits in dis-
cretizing and resolving the time values of a quantum
clock, originally introduced in [10] and then further de-
veloped in [11]. Our clock is represented by an observ-
able complement of a bounded and discrete clock Hamil-
tonian, which can have an equally-spaced or a generic
spectrum: we addressed both cases. We emphasize again
that the choice of a bounded Hamiltonian seems the most
natural considering that, when we deal with quantum
systems, we are always working with systems of ﬁnite
dimension and the introduction of unbounded Hamilto-
nians with continuous spectra would not be possible.
In the case of clock Hamiltonian with equally-spaced
energy spectrum, the (discrete) time observable can be
described both by an Hermitian operator (when z = p)
or by a POVM (when z > p). Continuous values for the
time observable can be recovered when z →∞.
