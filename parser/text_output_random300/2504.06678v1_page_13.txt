NON-ABELIAN QUASI-TOPOLOGICAL GAUGE THEORY
5.1
SU(N) Gauge Potential and Instanton Solutions
Set the system have N-fold degenerate ground state {|ψn(λ)⟩}, defining the non-Abelian connection:
Amn
µ
= i⟨ψm|∂µψn⟩
(m, n = 1, . . . , N)
The gauge transformation is:
Aµ →U †AµU + iU †∂µU,
U ∈SU(N)
The Yang-Mills instanton solutions:
Aµ = σµνxν
x2 + ρ2 ,
Fµν =
4ρ2σµν
(x2 + ρ2)2
where σµν is the spin matrix and ρ is the instanton size parameter.
5.2
Non-Abelian Extension of Quasi-topological Number
Introduce the reference connection A(0)
µ
to define the relative connection:
∆Aµ = Aµ −A(0)
µ
The quasi-topological number is given by the second Chern class:
νweak =
1
8π2
Z
S
Tr

∆A ∧d∆A + 2
3∆A ∧∆A ∧∆A

It is calculated by substituting the instanton solutions:
νweak =
1
32π2
Z
Tr(F ∧F) = 1
The non-Abelian quasi-topological number corresponds to the instanton number, characterizing the quantum number
of topological excitations (such as skyrmions).

Equivalent Yang-Mills Fields under Multiple Degeneracies

where µ is the spatial index, and m, n = 1, 2, 3 . . . N. The Berry connection is an N-order matrix. Considering local
