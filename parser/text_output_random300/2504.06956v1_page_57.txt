Setup and main technical lemmas
Throughout this section, we fix γ >
√
2d, n ∈N, and a collection of non-negative constants (θi)i∈[n].
For any x ∈R, k > 0, and λ > 0, we define the (random) function Fλ
k,x : C(Rd) →R by
Fλ
k,x(Φ)
def=
1 −exp(−e−γx R

where Fγ : Rd →R is the function given by

We introduce here the main processes and fields that will be used for the reminder of this section:
• Let B′ be a standard Brownian motion and R a three-dimensional Bessel process starting at zero.
For any z ≥0, define Uz to be a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval [−z, 0],
independent of all other processes. Also, let τz
def= inf{s ≥0 : B′
s = Uz}. We then define the
process
Γz
s
def=
(
B′
s ,
if s ≤τz ,
Rs−τz + Uz ,
if s > τz .
(7.3)
• For b > 0 and z ≥0, we let gz
b be the field on Rd given by
gz
b(·)
def= −

(1 −K(e−(s+b)·))dΓz

∞(e−b·) −

(1 −K(e−(s+b)·))ds ,
(7.4)
where Z′
∞has the same law as the field Z∞defined in Definition 3.9, and it is independent of the
process Γz.
• For b > 0, we recall that Υb denotes the field on Rd introduced in (4.2) and given by
Υb(·)
def= −
Z b
0
(1 −K(e−s·))dBs + Zb(·) −
√
2dab(·) ,
where Zb is introduced in Definition 3.9, B is an independent Brownian motion, and ab is the
function defined in (2.2).
Remark 7.1. We emphasise that the processes and fields introduced above are all assumed to be
mutually independent. Additionally, given x, y ∈R and b > 0, we write Px,y,b for the probability
measure under which (Bs)s∈[0,b] is a Brownian bridge from x to y in time b, while the other
processes/fields are left unchanged. Moroever, given a function g : Rd →R, we set Υb,g = Υb + g.
In what follows, for b > 0 and z ≥0, we need to consider the field given by the sum of Υb and gz
b. In
order to lighten the notation, instead of writing the field gz
b as a subscript of Υb, we let
Υz
b
def= Υb + gz
b .
(7.5)
We also observe that a standard Gaussian tail bound implies that, uniformly over all z ≥0, the field
gz
b satisfies (G1) – (G3).
For λ > 0 and A, L, b ≥0, we introduce the function Fλ
A,L,b : R × C(Rd) →R given by
Fλ
