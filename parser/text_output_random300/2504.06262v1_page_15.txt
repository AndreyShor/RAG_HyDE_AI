As we can see from the expression of the susceptibility,
the first order cancels out, as we predicted from a centro-
symmetric medium (here we assumed isotropy which is
stronger than centro-symmetry).
2. Three-level system: optical pumping and transit
The two-level closed system is a simple but unreal-
istic model (Phillips, 1997).
For a better understand-
ing of the system, we have to consider the splitting of
5S1/2 (previously defined as the ground state) into two
hyperfine levels F = 1 and F = 2 (for 87Rb), which
are separated by δ0 = 2π·6.835 GHz (Steck, 2001). In
the case of the excited state, we can neglect the hy-
perfine splitting as it spans over 2π·496 MHz, which is
comparable to the Doppler-broadened atomic linewidth
ΓD = k0

∼2π·250MHz for a typical vapor temper-
ature of 140°C (ΓD being 1/√e times the half-width of
the broadened linewidth). We also have to take into ac-
count the transit of the atoms through the beam. Hence
we model the atoms as an open three-level system. The
two ground states F = 1 and F = 2 will be noted |1⟩and
|2⟩, and the excited state |3⟩.
In the case where the laser field only drives the F = 1
ground state, the atoms in the excited state will sponta-
neously decay to both hyperfine ground states, and thus
will be pumped into the other ground state F = 2 over
time (which acts as a dark state).
With a continuous
laser beam, this optical pumping effect would cause the
medium to become transparent at a time scale of tens of
µs (Labeyrie et al., 2006).
However, the atomic transit balances optical pumping
out. Due to atomic motion, atoms exit the beam in a

8kBT (Sagle et al., 1996) and undergo
relaxation processes. Here w is the mean path taken by
an atom inside the beam, v is the mean speed given by
the Boltzmann distribution, and w0 is the beam waist
(w ≤w0). We assume that outside of the beam the gas
behaves like a reservoir, and thus retains a stable mixture
of atoms in the two ground states since the energy sep-
aration of the states is below kBT. This means that the
populations in the beam are constantly replenished by
the reservoir, which counterbalances the optical pump-
ing. The effectiveness of the effect of transit depends on
the rate Γt = 1/τt (mostly depending on the beam waist,
and marginally on the temperature), compared to the
pumping rate (mostly depending on the laser detuning
and intensity).
For a more complete picture, we can consider that the
electric field also drives the transition from the other
ground state F = 2 to the excited state, at a detun-
ing ∆+ δ0 as depicted in Fig. 6. The hamiltonian in the

2 + γcol is the dephasing rate due to spontaneous
emission and collisions.
Within the beam, the atoms of each level |i⟩exit
the beam at a rate Γtρii and go into the reservoir. We
assume a memory-less process for simplicity, meaning
that the atoms in the reservoir are always taken in a
statistical mixture of the two ground states. Denoting
