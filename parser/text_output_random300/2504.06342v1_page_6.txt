ulate the AGN feedback-driven outflows, with de-
tailed prescriptions described in §2.3.
The parameters of the initial conditions are sum-
marized in Table 1. The initial conditions are set
to match those of the fiducial MACER2D model as
closely as possible for comparison purposes. The
only significant difference is the initial central gas
density is much higher in MACER3D, consistent
with observations of ellipticals (e.g., Capelo et al.
2010; Werner et al. 2012), while the initial gas den-
sity in MACER2D is negligible and relies on stellar
winds for gas supply.
2.3. Two-mode AGN feedback physics
MACER3D implements AGN feedback through
a sophisticated subgrid model based on its pre-
decessor MACER2D (Yuan et al. 2018).
The
model distinguishes between two primary feedback
modes: the hot (radio) mode and the cold (quasar)
mode, delineated by a critical BH accretion rate
¤𝑀BH ∼0.02 ¤𝑀Edd (Yuan & Narayan 2014). The hot
mode occurs when low-density gas accretes onto
the central SMBH, driving radio-mode feedback,
while the cold mode activates during high-density
gas accretion, powering quasar-mode feedback. Al-
though the hot mode encompasses winds, jets, and
radiation, we defer the implementation of jet feed-
back to future work for simplicity. For the cold
mode, we consider only winds and radiation, ex-
cluding jets – a choice consistent with observations
showing that radio-loud quasars constitute only a
small fraction of the total quasar population (Keller-
mann et al. 1989; Ivezi´c et al. 2002; Ba˜nados et al.
2015; Liu et al. 2021).
The AGN feedback mode, hot or cold, is deter-
mined by the accretion rate onto the central SMBH
¤𝑀BH, which is calculated on the fly. Since the in-
ner boundary of our simulation is set at 𝑟in = 25 pc,
which is typically smaller than the Bondi radius, we
can directly compute the accretion rate crossing the
inner boundary ¤𝑀(𝑟in), from which the BH accre-
tion rate ¤𝑀BH and the properties of wind (outflow)
can be inferred via the standard black hole accretion
theory and observations, as detailed below.
2.3.1. The hot (radio) mode
The accretion flow in the hot AGN mode is mod-
eled to consist of two distinct regions:
a trun-
cated thin disk at large radii and a hot accretion
flow within the truncation radius (Yuan & Narayan
2014). The truncation radius is given by:
𝑟tr ≈3𝑟s
0.02 ¤𝑀Edd
¤𝑀(𝑟in)
2
(3)
where 𝑟s denotes the Schwarzschild radius. While
observational evidence for winds from hot accre-
tion flows (Wang et al. 2013; Cheung et al. 2016;
Peng et al. 2020; Shi et al. 2021, 2022) and its inter-
action with ISM (Shi et al. 2024) has emerged re-
cently, robust constraints on their properties remain
limited. Therefore, following Yuan et al. (2018), we
adopt the theoretical prescriptions from Yuan et al.
(2015):
¤𝑀BH = ¤𝑀(𝑟in)
3𝑟s
𝑟tr
0.5
,
(4)
¤𝑀wind,hot = ¤𝑀(𝑟in) −¤𝑀BH,
(5)
𝑣wind hot = (0.2 −0.4)𝑣K(𝑟tr),
(6)
where 𝑣K(𝑟tr) represents the Keplerian velocity at
the truncation radius. Consistent with (Yuan et al.
2018), we restrict the angular distribution of the
wind to 30◦−70◦and 110◦−150◦.
For radiative processes, we implement the de-
tailed calculations of hot accretion flow radiative
efficiency from Xie & Yuan (2012).
This effi-
ciency is significantly lower than that of standard
