Table 1: The ten highest reconstruction errors from the pre-flagged light curve samples contained in the test set. We evaluated
the lowest-loss light curve model from Section 2.2 against the entire test dataset unseen during training/validation, recording the
reconstruction error for each sample. Examination of the ten lowest reconstruction error light curves shows a variety of space
objects (SOs). Seven light curves are from satellites (all of which are in orbit), and three belong to rocket bodies. US: United

Examination of the ten lowest reconstruction error light curves shows a variety of space objects (SOs). Seven light curves are
from satellites (of which one is no longer in orbit), two belong to rocket bodies, and one to debris. JPN: Japan, US: United States

framework CASSANDRA (Computational Agent For Space
Situational Awareness And Debris Remediation Automation).
Within this framework is an orbital simulator first introduced
by Vasile et al.
(2023), generating the light curves using a
CAD model of an orbiting Space Object with a specific ge-
ometry. This dataset contains 800 simulations of four different
satellite platforms: a boxwing satellite (e.g., Jason-3), Sentinel-
3, SMOS, and Starlink. These space objects (SOs) orbit an
observing ground station, with both light and spectral curves
recorded as time courses. Within these 800 simulations, a sub-
set contain anomalous events of varying magnitudes - specifi-
cally debris collisions that result in detectable changes in signal.
These changes in signal are shown in Figure 6 F, H, where oth-
erwise linear light curves abruptly change to a different profile,
oscillating in magnitude between very high and low minima.
Our fine-tuning approach combines the pre-training objective
with supervised learning to better characterise space object be-
haviour (see Equation 8 for details). Briefly, we impose the ad-
ditional constraint of classification, where our Perceiver-VAE
is simultaneously maintaining reconstruction whilst learning to
distinguish between anomalous and non-anomalous curves. We
focus on light curves due to public availability of the MMT-9
real observational dataset, however the CASSANDRA simu-
lator also generates hyperspectral light curves. Therefore, we
also present finetuning results on normal/anomalous hyperspec-
tra, allowing us to explore the versatility of our approach and
model performance across a different data modality.
To understand stability of fine-tuning, we fine-tuned our pre-
trained Perceiver-VAE five times to convergence on the light
curve and hyperspectral curves from the CASSANDRA fine-
tuning dataset (Figure 7). We then average training runs and
compute the variance.
For light curves, we found our pre-
trained model could classify anomalies in the fine-tuning val-
idation dataset with approximately 88% accuracy, and 0.9 Re-
ceiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC
AUC) (Figure 7 A-D). Throughout training, the correlation be-
tween reconstruction loss and classification accuracy increased
to approximately 0.28 (Figure 7 E). This suggests that the
features learned during reconstruction are useful in classify-
ing anomalous light curves from non-anomalous. For the hy-
perspectra, we found similarly high accuracy after fine-tuning
(Figure 7), with validation accuracies of approximately 84%
and ROC AUC scores of approximately 0.86. However, unlike
