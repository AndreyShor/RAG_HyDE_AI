3.1
Modelling Network Topologies
The network topology in the study of Cyber-Physical Power Systems (CPPS) may refer to the
topology of the physical system, i.e., the power grid with its substations, buses, and transmission
lines. It may also refer to the communication network and how communication links connect routers,
firewalls, switches, and hosts. In this paper, the network topology refers to the communication
network topology. The proposed model generation focuses on star, radial, and statistical topologies.
The difference among these topologies is how the substations are connected to the UCC. These
network topologies are illustrated in Fig. 3, where each node matches the color of the communication
network shown in Fig. 2. The choice of topology depends on factors such as the devices to be
connected, the desired reliability of the network, and the cost of cabling[14]. Each topology offers
different advantages and is employed in specific contexts based on scalability, fault tolerance, and
ease of maintenance[7]. Following is an overview of each topology:
• Star topologies have all nodes connected directly to a central node, such as a UCC. All
data passes through the central node. If it fails, communication between all substations is
disrupted.
• Radial topologies organize nodes in a hierarchical structure, where a central node connects
to one or more secondary nodes, which in turn link to additional nodes. Since generation
and transmission substations serve different functions, their connections to utilities can
vary, making this hierarchical structure a suitable approach. However, a key drawback of
radial topologies is their susceptibility to single points of failure[12].
• Statistics-based: The communication links can be modeled after the transmission power
lines between substations, but the communication network does not exactly follow the
power network in the real world. Hence, this paper also considers that substations can be
connected in a mesh/hybrid topology that we call statistical topology connection, based on
the network metrics derived in [24].
