radial topologies. After clustering, labels are assigned to all nodes, including utilities and substations.
For example, a substation label looks like this: Region.Utility_number.Substation_name. This label
indicates the substation’s regional and utility affiliation. Regardless of the topology, each substation,
UCC, and BA have specific cyber components, as depicted in Fig. 2. These cyber components are
created using an object-oriented programming approach.
4.2.2
Creating Cyber-Physical Components. The cyber-physical model is created using object-
oriented programming based on the architecture in Fig. 6. It has five classes (data types) including
Substation, Utility, Regulatory, Nodes, and Links. They are organized as Cyber Classes and Physical
Classes.
Links and Nodes are considered Cyber classes. The Link class has attributes such as the link’s
source and destination nodes, the media type of the link, bandwidth in bits per second, and distance
(or length of the link). The Node class contains attributes such as region, utility, substation, IP
address, label, and the Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) where the node is installed. Its sub-
classes generate the cyber and cyber-physical nodes inside substations and utilities, such as switch,
router, host, firewall, relay, and relay controller. To indicate the types of applications they support,
hosts and relay controllers have attributes such as openPorts and protocol. Physical classes include
Utility, Substation and Regulatory, which are higher-level nodes that contain links and nodes. Their
relationship to each other can be explained as follows: a Utility contains Substations, while a
Regulatory contains Utilities. In particular, a Substation class has unique attributes such as the
number of relays it contains (relaynum). Furthermore, we can model different types of substations,
such as generation, transmission, and distribution. Generation substations can in turn be modeled
as conventional generation, distributed energy resources (DER), or virtual power plant. In this
paper, we focus on transmission and conventional generation substations. Being part of the Wide
