for selected HEAs from this review are also plotted. Notably, the actual bcc phase
composition of NbScTiZr annealed at 400 ◦C is Nb27.9Sc21.6Ti25.3Zr25.2[55]. While
quinary HEA superconductors display Matthias-rule-like behavior, their Tc values are
reduced compared to conventional alloys, as observed for Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6
and (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5. However, an enhancement in Tc is evident in NbScTiZr with
its ﬁne eutectic microstructure, underscoring the importance of materials research on
eutectic HEA superconductors with varied VECs.
Only one research paper reports the feasibility of HEA superconducting wire[75],
as discussed in subsection 3.5. At this stage, the Jc values of wire samples remain
unsatisfactory, particularly with regard to their magnetic performance at higher ﬁelds.
To address this, optimizing ﬂux pinning—such as by introducing nanoscale precip-
itates—proves to be a promising approach. Another critical factor inﬂuencing Jc is
the morphology of the grain boundary. The reported method for fabricating HEA
superconducting wires is currently limited to sintering. For instance, drawing a rod of
HEA produced via arc melting could signiﬁcantly alter the morphology of the grain
boundary.
For practical deployment, machinability and cost-eﬀectiveness of constituent ele-
ments are crucial. The mechanical properties of HEAs discussed in this review still
need to be explored, necessitating future investigations. Since Hf and Sc are relatively
expensive compared to Ti, Zr, and Nb, reducing their content should be a priority in
the design of superconducting wires.
9 Summary
This review surveyed studies on Jc in various bcc HEA superconductors. The Korean
team has extensively researched Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 in bulk, thin-ﬁlm, and
wire forms. The SPS-prepared samples exhibit relatively higher Jc compared to their
as-cast counterparts, primarily attributed to Fe-based intermetallic impurities. The
Fe contamination originates from the stainless-steel jar and balls utilized in the
ball-milling process. Remarkable improvements in Jc are achieved in thin-ﬁlm and
thermally treated samples. While the thin-ﬁlm state generally enhances Jc, the lat-
tice strain induced by thermal annealing is pivotal in strengthening ﬂux pinning in
heat-treated samples. The (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 system is particularly intriguing due
to its pronounced ﬁshtail eﬀect, which increases Jc with elevated magnetic ﬁelds. This
eﬀect is attributed to nanoscale precipitates. Additionally, lattice strain, observed
at optimal annealing temperatures, contributes to improving the low-ﬁeld Jc per-
formance. The eutectic NbScTiZr alloy demonstrates enhanced Jc, driven by the
combined eﬀects of lattice strain and its ﬁne eutectic microstructure. In contrast to
Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 and (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5, lattice strain in NbScTiZr is
inherent in the as-cast state. However, thermal annealing at 400 ◦C introduces even
greater strain. This suggests that lattice strain induced by thermal annealing may be
a common feature of Nb-based HEAs.
We also compared Jc among representative HEAs discussed in this review.
Employing both eutectic microstructures accompanied by lattice strain and nano-
sized precipitates will likely achieve signiﬁcantly elevated Jc values over a broad
