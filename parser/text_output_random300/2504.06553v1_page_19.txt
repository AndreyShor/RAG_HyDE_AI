Table 10.
Conditional Probability Table PœÑ=1(O|SO)
Setting Œ≤ = 100, we obtain an updated PœÑ=1(SO|X)
given in Table 9.
This conditional probability informs us of a soft cluster
map to group the primitives to objects. In this case, x1, x2,
x5 each corresponds to an object and x3, x4 are grouped
together as primitives of the same object. Furthermore, we
can label these clusters by taking the argmax of P (O|SO),
which is shown in Tab. 10 and can be obtained by manipu-
lating the probability as follows,
p1(o|so) =
X
x‚ààX
p(o|x)p1(x|so), ‚àÄ(o, so) ‚ààO √ó SO
(48)
To summarize, after this first iteration of just the object
layer, 4 objects are obtained, an object with label p con-
sisting of the primitive x1, an object with label p consisting
of the primitive x2, an object with label s consisting of the
primitives x3 and x4, and an object with label q consisting
of the primitive x5.
We repeat this for all three layers and for n iterations
until convergence. The final PœÑ=n(SO|X), PœÑ=n(SU|SO),
PœÑ=n(ST |SU) is given in Table 11, Table 12, and Ta-
ble 13 respectively with associated final PœÑ=n(O|SO),
PœÑ=n(U|SU), PœÑ=n(T |ST ) given in Table 14, Table 15, and
Table 16. The combined gives us a hierarchy where task Œì
consists of subtask A, which consists of 2 objects both with
label p that came from two different primitives x1 and x2,
and task ‚Ñ¶consists of 2 subtasks B and C, subtask B con-
sists of an object with label q from primitive x5 and subtask
C consists of an object with label s from primitives x3 and
x4. This is visually shown in Fig. 12, where the edges rep-
resent the cluster assignment from taking the argmax of the
conditional probabilities.
