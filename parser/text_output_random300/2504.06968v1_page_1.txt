Abstract
Detection of spectral line in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is importance for studying GRB
physics, as it provides insights into the composition and physical conditions of the GRB envi-
ronment. However, progress in detecting X-ray or gamma-ray emission and absorption lines
in GRB spectra has been relatively slow, only the narrow emission line feature of about 10
MeV found in GRB 221009A has exhibited a significance exceeding 5σ. Here, we report the
probable evidence of a narrow emission feature at about 2.1 mega–electron volts (MeV) in the
spectrum of GRB 221023A. The highest statistical significance of this feature is observed in
the time interval between 8 and 30 seconds after Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor trigger,
with the chance probability value < 2.56 × 10−5 (after accounting for the look-elsewhere ef-
fect), corresponding to a Gaussian-equivalent significance> 4.20σ. We interpret this feature
as being generated through the de-excitation of excited electrons in the relativistic hydrogen-
like high-atomic-number ions entrained in the GRB jet.
Introduction
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous stellar explosions in the universe. These events
generally appear as brief and intense γ-rays followed by a long-lived afterglow emission. The GRB
prompt emission originates from relativistic jets that dissipate the energy and accelerate particles
either via internal shocks or magnetic reconnection, with high variability and usually lasts from
milliseconds to thousands of seconds1–3. Most of the observed spectrum of GRB prompt emission
