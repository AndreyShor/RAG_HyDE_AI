CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
In this review, we have examined the rich variety of
ground states stabilized beyond the MF instability in
dipolar quantum gases made of magnetic atoms. Since
the discovery of the stabilization mechanism based on
quantum fluctuations a decade ago, extensive experimen-
tal and theoretical efforts have unveiled the remarkable
properties of these states and deepened our understand-
ing.
Breakthroughs have been achieved, including the
first observation of spontaneously crystallized states [11],
the formation of ultradilute macrodroplets [12, 13], the
observation of both supersolid and insulating modulated
states in tubular and pancake geometries [15–17, 88], the
probing of the remarkable feature of their spectrum of ele-
mentary excitations [120, 122, 123] as well as their answer
to various perturbations, including rotation [135, 136].
Despite these achievements, many exciting directions
remain open for exploration. Further exploration of the
phase diagram may reveal supersolids with exotic struc-
tures, including stripe, honeycomb, labyrinth, and pump-
kin configurations [86, 91]. Beyond the characterization
of the individual phases, the transitions between these
phases and their associated critical properties provide a
rich landscape for advancing our understanding of com-
plex quantum many-body behavior [108, 125, 137]. More-
over, the investigation of the dynamical and hydrody-
namical properties of these exotic states is still in its
infancy.
In particular, much remains to be discovered
about the interplay between crystalline order and super-
fluidity in supersolids [87, 106, 108, 115, 117, 125, 130–
136, 138]. The realization of exotic traps, and in par-
ticular toroidal traps, offers a promising path to inves-
tigate these behaviors in purer environments, allowing
the decoupling of the different supersolid excitations and
the establishment of persistent flow [124]. Understand-
ing the supersolid behaviors may provide insights that
extend well beyond the dipolar gases themselves.
For
instance, analogies of supersolids with certain regions of
neutron stars have been suggested, opening up intriguing
prospects for quantum simulations of these cosmological
systems [139].
Alongside the rapid progress with magnetic atoms,
experimental and theoretical studies have expanded to
other dipolar systems. Notably, quantum gases of polar
molecules and mixtures with at least one dipolar species
have seen significant experimental advancements in re-
cent years [140–142]. These developments have sparked
predictions of novel behaviors in quantum-stabilized
states within these alternative platforms [143, 144].
The impact of the magnetic-atom results extends
even beyond dipolar gases.
They reignited inter-
est in supersolid-like phases in a variety of plat-
forms, including spin-orbit coupled BECs [56, 145, 146],
driven BECs [147], exciton-polariton [148], and certain
condensed-matter systems [149, 150].
This expanding
landscape promises rich cross-fertilization between plat-
forms and paves the way for future discoveries.
