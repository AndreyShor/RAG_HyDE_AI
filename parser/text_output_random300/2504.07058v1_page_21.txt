2D extended Fisher–Kolmogorov equation
In this study, we focus on the 2D nonlinear EFK equation.
𝑢𝑡+ 𝛾∆2𝑢−∆𝑢+ 𝑢3 −𝑢= 𝑔(𝑡, 𝑥, 𝑦)
in
(0,𝑇] × D
(3.15)
𝑢(0, 𝑥, 𝑦) = sin(𝜋𝑥) sin(𝜋𝑦)

D
(3.16)
𝑢= 𝑓1,
∆𝑢= 𝑓2
on
(0,𝑇] × 𝜕D.
(3.17)
The exact solution to equation (3.15) is sin(𝜋𝑥) sin(𝜋𝑦) exp(−𝑡). The source term 𝑔can be derive from exact
solution. The subsequent plots compare the exact and predicted solutions, shown in both contour and 3D surface
formats. Figures 12 and 14 provide graphical comparisons of the approximate solutions obtained using PINN and
the exact solution for 𝛾= 0.01, displayed as 3D visualizations at 𝑡= 0 and 𝑡= 1. The results confirm that the
PINN-based approximation aligns closely with the exact solution, demonstrating its stability. Additionally, Fig.
14 depicts the contour plot at 𝑡= 1. Table 7 reports the relative error E𝑟
𝐺and training error E𝑇, alongside the
chosen hyper-parameters.
