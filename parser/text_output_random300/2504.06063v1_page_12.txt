The quark-disconnected contraction shown in Figure 5
deserves some comments. In principle, this contraction

fg in all channels and,
therefore, it should be computed. On the other hand,
by interpreting this diagram in the partially-quenched
setup in which the quark fields of the current have the
same mass of the physical quarks but different flavor, one
has that the states propagating between the two currents
have flavor ¯cs ¯fg. Given our previous knowledge of the
QCD spectrum, a prerequisite to any decay rate or scat-
tering amplitude calculation, this implies that these are
states with energy mDsω0 > mDs. Therefore, although
the current-current contraction gives a contribution to
the correlator Cµν

fg it doesn’t contribute to the hadronic
tensor Hµν(p, ω) for ω0 ≤1. By relying on this argu-
ment we neglected the current-current contraction in our
calculation of the decay rate7.

Cµν(tsnk, t, tsrc, ω2) in the limits T/2 ≫tsnk ≫t > 0 ≫

where Hµν(p, ω) is the hadronic tensor and the dots rep-
resent again exponentially suppressed terms. From the
previous relation, by using the values of RP and mDs
extracted from C(t) (see Eq. (70)) and by projecting
the different components of Cµν(tsnk, t, tsrc) as done in
Eq. (13) to define the five independent spectral densities
Y(i)(ω0, ω2), we have extracted the correlators ˆY(i)(t, ω2)

Then, by performing the linear combinations of the
ˆY(i)(t, ω2) correlators corresponding to Eqs. (30), (43),
and (47), we obtain the correlators

In Figure 6 we show the extraction of the mass mDs on
the ensemble B64 from the correlator C(t).
The blue
points correspond to the so-called effective mass of the
correlator while the red band corresponds to the constant
fit of the effective mass in the plateau-region and, there-
fore, to our estimate of amDs. Similar plots can be shown
for all of the ensembles listed in Table I.
From the analysis of C(t) on the different ensembles we
7 Strictly speaking, since the presence of ghosts prevents a straight-
forward interpretation of partially-quenched theories within the
canonical formalism, this argument is not entirely rigorous. On
the other hand, the argument is strongly supported by a very
large amount of numerical evidence and therefore we consider it
fully satisfactory in practice.
