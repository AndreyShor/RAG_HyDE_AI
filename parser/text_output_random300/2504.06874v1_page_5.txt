simultaneously obtained with the SNOM image shown in Fig. 1h, where the surface of 
the tetralayer graphene region is featureless with a uniform height. By contrast, the 
SNOM image of the same region measured at around charge neutrality (Fig. 1h) shows 
three regions with distinct near-field optical contrast. The three regions are individual 
domains with different stacking orders that are separated by DWs: the brightest area 
(red dot) corresponds to the polar domain of either ABAC or ABCB domain (denoted 
 
Fig. 1. Schematic and Characterization of tetralayer graphene with broken 
symmetries. a, Stacking configurations of tetralayer graphene, including nonpolar ABAB, 
ABCA and polar ABAC, ABCB stackings. Different layers, from the top layer (L1) to the 
bottom layer (L4), are labeled by different colors, with A, B, C atomic sites indicated by the 
dashed lines. The polarization directions are also shown for ABAC and ABCB stackings. 
b,c, Calculated layer-projected band structure and charge density distribution for polar 
ABAC stacking by DFT. d,e, Calculated layer-projected band structure and charge density 
distribution for polar ABCB stacking by DFT. For band structures (b and d), each band is 
colored according to the weighted sum of the layer-resolved amplitude of the wavefunction. 
For charge density (c and e), we subtract superposition of charge density of four independent 
graphene layers to better visualize the charge redistribution in polar stacking order. f, A 
schematic of the gate-tunable SNOM measurement. g, Topography of a typical tetralayer 
graphene. h, SNOM image of the same area of tetralayer graphene as in (g). The image 
shows three different stacking orders, corresponding to ABAB (black dot), ABCA (blue dot) 
and ABCB-type (denoted as ABCB*, red dot) domains. i, Raman spectra for the 2D peaks 
measured from three different domains indicated by the colored dots in (h). The scale bars 
in (g) and (h) are 2 Âµm.
