PHYSICAL LOSS ANALYSIS ON THE SEVIR DATASET.
The nowcasting scenario may not strictly adhere to the NS equations. However, we believe that
incorporating the NS equations helps to capture the motion characteristics of nowcasting.
We conducted the following experiments: (1) Lowered the physical loss weight (weight = 0.1) while
keeping other settings unchanged. (2)Removed the physical loss entirely.
The results are showned on Table S9, which demonstrate that while nowcasting processes do not
strictly adhere to the NS equations, these equations effectively capture certain underlying motion
characteristics. When the physical loss weight is reduced, loosening the constraints, the MSE de-
creases. However, this relaxation comes at the cost of reduced ability to model essential motion
features, as reflected in the decline of the CSI.

ADDITIONAL RESULTS
In this section, we provide additional details on the experimental results presented in the main text.
This includes supplementary results for multi-physical quantity inference (Figure S9, Figure S10),
a comparison between our predicted velocity field and the velocity field predicted by NowcastNet
Figure S11, a detailed comparison between our method and baselines on the 2D fluid data (Figure
S12, Figure S13), 2D smoke data (Figure S14), 3D smoke data (Figure S15, Figure S16), and SEVIR
data (Figure S17, Figure S18).
