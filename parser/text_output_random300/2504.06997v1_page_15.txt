Fig. 10 Recovered baseline cerebral perfusion waveform (30 mins before lunch). The mean value of recovered CBFi 
by DL and the mean value of recovered decorrelation speed by single-exponential fitting were taking as the 
baselines to calculated the relative cerebral perfusion changes, respectively. 
Fig. 11 presents cerebral perfusion changes recovered by our model during the lunch test. The test 
conducted 30 minutes before lunch was used as the global baseline for calculating rCBFi at 
subsequent test phases. The results indicate a slight increase in cerebral perfusion immediately 
after lunch (5 minutes post-meal, light blue curves in Fig. 11), likely due to cortical stimulation 
from gustatory stimulation51,52. At 30 min, as blood flow is redirected to digestion, a short-term 
cerebral perfusion decrease occurred, followed by a return to baseline at 75 min (end of 
postprandial hyperemia53). Interestingly, at 120 min after lunch, a notable decrease was observed, 
coinciding with the subject’s reported fatigue and drowsiness54. These findings demonstrate that 
the proposed DL model, in combination with SPAD, can effectively assess dynamic brain activity-
induced CBF changes non-invasively and in real time. 
Additionally, we evaluated the computational efficiency of the DL model. The average processing 
time per 5,000 frames was 0.06 seconds, using our workstation GPU compared to 44.98 seconds 
for single-exponential fitting on our workstation CPU (CPU: Intel(R) Core™ i9-10900X @ 3.70 
GHz; Memory: 128 GB; GPU: NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000). This represents a 750-fold speed 
improvement, making our approach more suitable for neurophotonics applications where 
continuous monitoring and fast feedback are needed (e.g. bedside CBF tracking or neurofeedback).
