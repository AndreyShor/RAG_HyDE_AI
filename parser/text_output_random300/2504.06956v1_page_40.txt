Resampling property and independence from the threshold
The main goal of this section is to present some results concerning the fields eΥλ and Ψλ introduced
in Theorem A and Definition 2.7, respectively. In particular, in Section 5.1, we prove some key
technical results related to the field eΥλ. Then, in Section 5.2, we establish the “resampling property”
of the field eΥλ, as stated in Proposition 2.9, from which Proposition 2.11 follows directly. Finally, in
Section 5.3, we establish the independence of certain quantities of interest from λ. In particular, we
prove Proposition 2.13.
5.1
Some technical results
The main goal of this section is to establish a result concerning the limiting “shape field” Υλ introduced
in Theorem A, which will play a crucial role in the proof of some of our main theorems. Specifically,
the main goal of this section is to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 5.1. There exists a countable set Λc ⊆R+ such that for each λ, θ ∈Λ = R+ \ Λc it holds
that
P(M(eΥλ) = θ) = 0 .
(5.1)
Moreover, for all λ, θ ∈Λ, it holds that
P(|{x ∈Rd : eΥλ(x) −M(eΥλ) = −θ}| > 0) = 0 .
(5.2)
Furthermore, for each λ1 ̸= λ2 ∈Λ such that λ2 < λ1, the field eΥλ2 has the same law of the field eΥλ1
conditioned on the event M(eΥλ1) ≤λ2.
Remark 5.2. It follows from the proof of Lemma 5.1 that we may (and will) assume that, for any
λ, θ ∈Λ, the identities (5.1) and (5.2) hold also with M(eΥλ) replaced by M0,k(eΥλ) for some fixed
k ≥0.
In order to prove Lemma 5.1, we need to introduce some notation. We begin by defining the following
space
X
def= {(b, ϕ) : b ∈R+
0 ∪{∞}, ϕ ∈C(Rd, R ∪{−∞})} .
We equip the space X with the pseudometrics dX and dX defined as follows
dX((b1, ϕ1), (b2, ϕ2))
def= |e−b1 −e−b2| +

def= |e−b1 −e−b2| + sup
x∈Rd|χb1(x)ecϕ1(x) −χb2(x)ecϕ2(x)| ,
where c = c(d)
def=

2/d, and for each b ∈R+
0 ∪{∞}, χb : Rd →R is a smooth function such that
χb(x) = 1 for all |x| ≤eb and χb(x) = 0 for all |x| ≥eb + 1.
For each λ > 0, we let Aλ ⊆X be the set defined as follows
Aλ
def= {(b, ϕ) ∈X : M0,b(ϕ) ≤λ} .
Furthermore, we define the collection of measures (νb,λ)b>0 and the measure ν∞,λ as follows
νb,λ
def= c⋆,λ
√
b Law[(b, Υb)]|Aλ
and
ν∞,λ = Law[(∞, eΥλ)] ,
where ·|Aλ denotes the restriction to the subspace Aλ, and c⋆,λ is the constant introduced in
Theorem B.
