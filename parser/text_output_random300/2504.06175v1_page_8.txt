against input Bell fidelity. Each curve has a different gate and measurement error. The two plots look at symmetric and
asymmetry input Bell pairs.
tillation protocol is similar to that of recurrence shown
in Fig. 6 and described in Sec.III B 1. However the value
of r is typically higher than those in the corresponding
plots on Fig. 6 (see App. H for plots on Fig. 15).

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DEVICE
NOISE
Given the simulations of the previous sections, we now
want to consider distillation protocols on a real device.
We run experiments on a 127 qubit device with fixed
frequency qubits and fixed coupling, an IBM Eagle de-
vice ibm kyiv. For the purposes of these experiments we
consider smaller sections of the device with linear connec-
tivity and run each experiment in parallel across different
sections of the device in order to obtain more statistics
on noise. For more device details see Appendix E.
For each circuit we estimate the fidelity of the Bell
state using direct fidelity estimation by measuring three
circuits (see App. B for more).
However, this scheme
does have measurement error. In contrast to [42], here we
choose to not correct for measurement errors due to issues
that can cause potentially non-physical and or unexpect-
edly high fidelities (see, e.g., discussion in Ref. [48]). Our
experimental results thus provide a good lower bound on
the Bell fidelities.
A.
Two Bell distillation experiment with global
depolarizing noise
Following from the discussion on Sec. III B, first, we ex-
perimentally study the recurrence protocol under global
depolarizing noise. This global depolarizing channel Nλ
is implemented using layers of two-qubit Clifford circuits.
The first half of such a circuit is composed of multiple
applications of a length-k random sequence of two-qubit
Clifford gates and the second half is the inverse of the
first half. This inverse is simply the mirror image of the
first half and these layers are called mirror Clifford lay-
ers [49] (see Fig. 12 in App. G for an example of such a
circuit with two layers in the first half).
These measurements are carried out on a set of four
adjacent qubits on a device. On 13 such sets we carry
out the experiment outlined above for different fixed
k ∈{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}.
For each k we obtain an av-
erage of 13 sets of the before and after distillation Bell
fidelities along with the acceptance probability for distil-
lation. These are plotted in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7a we plot
the acceptance ratio as a function of the initial Bell fi-
delity. The dots represent points from the experiment
while the straight line is obtained from numerics.
In
Fig. 7b we plot the ratio r as a function of the initial
Bell fidelity prior to global depolarizing noise. The blue
dots represent data while the orange curve represents the
theoretically expected curve. This theoretical curve from
eq. (13) assumes noiseless gates and measurement. There
is fairly good agreement between the theory curves and
the experiment data, particularly considering the x-axis
is subject to systematic error due to measurement error
and the theory calculation assumes the distillation circuit
is perfect. This demonstrates that under some conditions
on the device we can see an improvement due to distilla-
tion, however the improvement arises from a systematic
procedure to degrade the Bell pairs via global depolar-
izing noise. Furthermore, high fidelity Bell pairs do not
improve in this experiment.
B.
Two Bell distillation experiment with idle noise
Here we consider a more natural experiment, create a
Bell pair and wait a time t for the Bell fidelity to decay
under device T1/T2 noise and then measure (note we ap-
ply a standard echo sequence to remove low frequency
noise). These T1/T2 noise channels are not simply Pauli
channels and they are not an effective error obtained from
