INTRODUCTION
In 2012, the discovery of a neutral Higgs boson with a mass around 125 GeV by the ATLAS
and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) marked a signiﬁcant milestone in
particle physics [1]. The properties of this newly discovered particle were found to be consistent
with the predictions made by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics.
Within the SM,
the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism explains how gauge bosons acquire their masses through
the process of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). However, the Standard Model does not
accommodate the existence of charged Higgs bosons, prompting theorists to propose extensions
that suggest their presence. Several theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) incorporate the
existence of charged Higgs bosons, such as the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM), supersym-
metric theories, composite Higgs models, grand uniﬁed theories, and axion models. The 2HDM
is especially important as it is structurally relevant in various new physics models, including
the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and composite Higgs theories.
The
characteristics and interactions of charged Higgs bosons vary depending on their couplings to
quarks, and discovering such charged states would indicate a deeper level of complexity in the
Higgs sector beyond what the Standard Model describes.
The photon-photon (γγ) collider at the International Linear Collider (ILC) oﬀers a promising
experimental opportunity in high-energy physics. It could lead to the detection of charged Higgs
bosons and other new phenomena. Within this experimental setup, high-energy electron-positron
beams will collide, resulting in the generation of energetic photons that will collide with one
another. This unique environment provides an excellent opportunity to explore various interac-
tions and processes, especially in the production of charged Higgs bosons. Future e+e−and γγ
colliders oﬀer higher sensitivity and luminosity compared to traditional e+e−collisions, potentially
improving the chances of discovering new charged states. Preliminary analyses indicate that the
production rates for the γγ →H+H−mode may surpass those of the γγ →H+H−process due
to the suppression of s-channel contributions at higher energies. While the production of charged
Higgs pairs through e+e−and γγ) collisions have been examined at various levels of theoretical
precision, further investigation is essential to dissect the intricacies of these processes, especially
considering the implications of loop corrections in diﬀerent models.
This paper focuses on a multivariate analysis of charged Higgs boson production at the photon-
