Starting at time t = 0 with the system in level 1, our question of interest is: what is the
state of the system at any time t > 0? More specifically, what is the stay-put probability P1(t)
of the system in level 1 at time t > 0? Evidently, from the very nature of the studied dynamical
scenario, one expects an interplay of time scales related to coherent evolution of the system
and to decoherence effects induced due to the application of pulses. Depending on which one
of the two time scales is dominant would dictate the state of the system at a later time t > 0,
and it is this feature of interplay that we want to unravel in our present study.
2.2. Analysis of the stay-put probability
Considering the form of Eq. (10), we see that the interaction operator T for our model
system is itself stochastic, in that it contains the classical stochastic variable θ that takes
up a different value every time there is an application of pulse. Recall also that this stochastic
variable (hence, the interaction operator T ) corresponding to different instants of application
of pulses is completely uncorrelated. Then, while computing the average density operator,
one has to average further the result (3) with respect to the statistical properties of this source
of randomness. Denoting the corresponding averaged interaction operator by (T )av, and
following the same steps as the ones involved in deriving Eq. (6), we obtain in the Laplace
space the time-evolution operator, in which all sources of randomness have been averaged
over, as
eU(s) =

(s+λ)I+iH×
0 −λ(T )av
−1 ; T = e−iθS×,
(11)
where S× is the time-independent Liouvillian (super)operator corresponding to the operator S
in Eq. (10). Reverting to the time domain gives
ρ(t) = U(t)ρ(0); U(t) = exp[(−iH×
0 +λ(T )av −λ)t].
(12)
The difference of the present work with respect to Ref. [20] is that in the latter, the only source
of randomness was in the time instants of interaction, and there was no further randomness as
contained in our case in the stochastic variable θ.
2.2.1. Matrix elements of superoperator T
We begin our analysis with the computation
of the matrix elements of the superoperator T . As a model for the random variable θ,
we take it from dimensional arguments to be an angle-like variable distributed uniformly
in [0,2π), yielding (cosθ)av = (sinθ)av = 0, and (cos2 θ)av = (sin2 θ)av = 1/2. Noting that
S2 = |2⟩⟨2|+|3⟩⟨3| = P2 +P3, the respective projection operators, and S3 = S,S4 = S2,S5 = S,
etc., we get
e−iθS = I−(P2 +P3)(1−cosθ)−iSsinθ.
