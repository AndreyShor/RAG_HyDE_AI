Figure 3.
Energy level diagram showing an example of the level repulsion which
occurs when detunings are nonzero. Full lines show the anti-crossing of two of the
eigenergies of the 4-level system for ε = 0.015ω, δe/g1 = −1, δe/g2 = 1, whilst dashed
lines show the case where there is no detuning (ε = 0). The colour of the anticrossing
eigenvalues is coded by the corresponding expectation value of the doublet operator,
ˆD, illustrating the rapid transition in doublet type that occurs as the system evolves
through the avoided crossing.
[Eq. 10]. However, the atomic detuning terms introduce new structure when expressed
in the radiation basis, leading to off-diagonal couplings between the doublet types. These
terms transform as

As before, the full Hamiltonian includes two Rabi models that we could call again
type 1 and type 2 (described by Eq. 10). However, they are no longer independent: the
detuning, ε, generates a weak coupling between the two models that mixes the type of the
excited state. Recalling the block-structure picture from Sec. 3.1, the Hamiltonian now
gains weak off-diagonal terms linking the two previously independent blocks. Although
the doublet symmetry is no longer exact, it remains a valuable approximate symmetry
when ε ≪ω. In this regime it is clear that most eigenstates can still be meaningfully
classified by their dominant doublet character. The key exceptions arise near avoided
crossings, where the energy levels of different types approach and strongly hybridise
due to the detuning-induced coupling. Since ε sets the size of the anti-crossing it can
no longer be considered small and indeed the type of the eigenvalues swaps over as
illustrated in Fig. 3.
Finally, we note that when m ̸= n, there are residual atomic states that form
additional dark states arise with no coupling to the field (see Appendix A). At first sight
