SHIELDING FACTOR DETERMINATION
The Methods section mentions that to accurately subtract background contributions from Helium and CYTOP from
our data sets, we empirically estimate a shielding factor parameter. Here, we define this parameter in more detail and
explain precisely how we estimate it to derive our processed data. For each temperature at which we measured data,
we made three measurements: One on the entire sample assembly – with the crystals, CYTOP adhesive, and Helium
in the background, one on a “dummy” sample – a sample without crystals but with a nearly matching amount of
CYTOP – and background Helium, and one with no sample in the beam path and only Helium. For clarity, we call
these measurements, respectively, M[Sample + He + CYTOP], M[He + CYTOP], and M[He]. We also let D[Sample]
be our best estimate of the data only from the crystal sample.
In theory, one would imagine that subtracting M[He + CYTOP] from M[Sample + He + CYTOP] would yield a
good estimate of D[Sample]. Unfortunately, this approach does not account for the effect of neutrons being shielded
from the CYTOP by the sample itself. For this reason, practical background subtraction for all temperatures is best
approached with the model
D[Sample] = M[Sample + He + CYTOP] −β M[He + CYTOP] −(1 −β)M[He],
(1)
where β is a “self-shielding factor” parameter. Note that for all choices of β, the He signal is fully accounted for. This
only changes the amount of the CYTOP-only signal that is subtracted from M[Sample + He + CYTOP] to estimate
D[Sample].
Empirically, we find that the CYTOP signal is strongest in the elastic line: i.e. where there is zero energy transfer.
Figure 1 shows this elastic signal from CYTOP integrated along the [H 0 0] and equivalent directions measured at
T=1.7 K. It also shows D[Sample] estimated with various shielding factors. It is clear that in the β = 0 case the
CYTOP is under-subtracted – as it is ignored completely – but in the β = 1 case there is over-subtraction of the
CYTOP signal. By examining plots like these, we found choices for β that minimized CYTOP signals for all data sets.
For T=1.7 K and T=40 K data, the best choice was clearly β=0.71. The noisiness of the T=150 K data made this
parameter much harder to estimate, but it was chosen to be β = 1.75, although all values in the range β ∈[1.5, 2.0]
seemed reasonable. Note that the dummy sample for the 150K background was taken in a slightly different geometry,
which is why we have β > 1; normally physical constraints would govern 0 < β < 1 for a dummy sample in the same
geometry and the same amount of CYTOP. The figure below reproduces Figure 3 with the T=150 K cut reflecting
this shielding factor uncertainty, which results in higher error bars.
ORIGIN OF CHIRAL DETECTOR ARTIFACTS IN UNPROCESSED SCATTERING DATA
Figure 9 in Extended Data shows the steps of processing the incoming CNCS data. The raw data in panel (a)
shows strong scattering features at [1 0 0] and equivalent positions. These appear as “streaks” of a chiral nature and
