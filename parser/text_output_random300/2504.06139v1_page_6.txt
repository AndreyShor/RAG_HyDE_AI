The Non-Signalling Polytope
Barrett et al.[1] characterized the class of non-signalling correlations. All
probability distributions within this class are subject to the following condi-
tions:
1. positivity
P(ab|xy) ≥0;
2. normalization
X
a,b
P(ab|xy) = 1;
3. non-signalling constraints (see deﬁnition 2).
Since these constraints are linear, the class forms a polytope.
To deter-
mine the dimension of the polytope, ﬁrst note that the set of probabilities
P(a, b|x, y) where x, y, a, b ∈{0, 1} form a table with 24 entries. The dimen-
sion of the polytope is then given by subtracting the number of independent
constraints from 24 which gives us the number of in-dependant “variables”
of the table, and turns out to be 8.
The polytope has 24 vertices, 16 of which correspond to local deterministic
boxes of the form
P αβγδ(a, b|x, y) =
(
1
if a = αx ⊕β, b = γy ⊕δ
0
otherwise
where α, β, γ, δ ∈{0, 1}. These alone form the local polytope containing all
local boxes as a convex combination of those 16 vertices. The remaining 8
vertices of the non-local polytope are of the form
P αβγ(a, b|x, y) =
(
1/2
if a ⊕b = xy ⊕αx ⊕βy ⊕γ
0
otherwise
where α, β, γ ∈{0, 1}.
Theorem 4. All vertices of the local polytope are equivalent under reversible
local operations and all non-local vertices of the non-signalling polytope are
equivalent under reversible local operations.
