potential for generating well-defined qubit properties through precise defect engineering. However, 
several challenges remain [2,4]: 
i) 
Defect Concentration and Spatial Control: Achieving a high density of optically active defects 
while maintaining spatial precision is crucial for scaling quantum devices. 
ii) 
Charge State Stability: The performance of defect-based qubits depends on stable charge 
states, and only specific charged states of color centers are suitable for quantum applications. 
iii) 
High-purity material: Impurities and unintentionally introduced defects create local strain and 
electric field variations, leading to inhomogeneous broadening of optical and spin transition 
lines. 
Defects in SiC have been identified as promising candidates for various quantum applications, including 
[9,10,11,12,16,19,20,21]: 
i) 
Quantum Computing: Defect-based qubits can serve as scalable quantum information 
processors, leveraging SiC's mature fabrication ecosystem. 
ii) 
Quantum Sensing: The spin properties of SiC color centers enable ultrasensitive detection of 
magnetic, electric, and thermal fields. 
iii) 
Quantum Communication: Color centers in SiC, particularly those operating at telecom 
wavelengths, offer pathways for secure quantum information transfer over fiber-optic 
networks. 
As illustrated in Figure 1, the number of research publications on quantum qubits has increased 
significantly over the past decade, reflecting the growing interest in defect-based quantum technologies. 
The data was obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection using the keyword search “quantum 
qubits.” This trend underscores the expanding role of SiC as a key material in the development of next-
generation quantum devices.
