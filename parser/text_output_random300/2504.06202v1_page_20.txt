in D′, then γj crosses the annulus D′ \ D. By the scale invariance of the Brownian loop measure,
the total mass of γj such that γj crosses D′ \ D and γj ⊂B2ri is bounded by some constant c1(ρ).
Moreover, the total mass of γj such that γj ∩Bc
2ri ̸= ∅and γj does not surround Bri is bounded by
some constant c2. Therefore, the total mass of γj that does not stay in D′ is bounded by c1(ρ)+c2.
On the other hand, the total mass of loops in D′ \ D that surround D is bounded from below by
some constant c3. Combining these two estimates, it follows that we can resample γj by a new loop
γ′
j that stays in D′ \ D and surrounds D with a cost at least c3/(c1(ρ) + c2). We refer to Figure 4.2
for an illustration (j = 1).
Case (2). Suppose |xj −yj| ≥ρri/4. Then, the total mass of all bridges in Bri+1 connecting
xj and yj is bounded by the Green’s function GBri+1(xj, yj), which is = O(| log ρ|) + c4 for some
constant c4. We now construct two cones T 1
j and T 2
j such that
• T 1
j ∩Bri ⊂Bρri/8(xj) and T 2
j ∩Bri ⊂Bρri/8(yj). Both of the arcs T 1
j ∩∂Bρri/8(xj) and
T 2
j ∩∂Bρri/8(yj) have length greater than C1ρri for some small constant C1.
• The sides of each cone are truncated when they intersect ∂B1.5ri, and the arc on ∂B1.5ri that
joins the endpoints consists of the remaining side of the cone.
• Both cones do not intersect Bρri(x3−j) ∪Bρri(y3−j).
Given the excursion ηj, we can reconstruct the remaining bridge in the following way with a constant
cost c5(ρ):
• Let β1
j (resp. β2
j ) be a Brownian motion started from xj (resp. yj) and restricted to exit
T 1
j ∪Bρri/8(xj) (resp. T 2
j ∪Bρri/8(yj)) from ∂B1.5ri and stopped there.
• Let ωj be a Brownian path from the endpoint of β2
j to that of β1
j , such that it is contained
in a (C2ri)-sausage of the arc between the endpoints (for some C2 > 0 small enough).
• We construct the new loop γ′
j by the concatenation γ′
j := ηj ⊕β2
j ⊕ωj ⊕[β1
j ]R. Note that this
decomposition is unique since ηj is the unique admissible excursion of γ′
j that has diameter
greater than ρri/4.
It follows that we can resample γj by a new loop γ′
j constructed above with cost at least c6(ρ). See
Figure 4.2 for j = 2.
In fact, for case (1), we can also construct a suitable cone T 3
j with a similar form such that
T 3
j ∩Bri ⊂D. Then, with probability at least c7(ρ) > 0, there exists a loop (in navy in Figure 4.2)
in T 3
j that intersects D and surrounds an arc on ∂B1.4ri of length greater than C3ri.
Since there are two cases for each j, there are four cases in total. We will only consider the case
j = 1 in case (1) and j = 2 in case (2) for an illustration. We do the resampling for both values of j as
above, to get the desired new loops, which has some constant cost c8(ρ) := c3 c6(ρ) c7(ρ)/(c1(ρ)+c2).
We can further choose the cones such that T 3
1 and T 1
2 ∪T 2
2 are well-separated from each other, in
the sense that if we enlarge the angle of each cone by some fixed constant proportion, then they
are still disjoint. Moreover, all the clusters that intersect each cone can be forced to stay in the
respective larger cone with some positive probability c9(ρ). We further require all the other clusters
in Lri+1 that intersect ∂Bri, except the two containing γ1 and γ2 respectively, to have diameter
smaller than ri/100, which occurs with probability c10 > 0. Resampling the loops γj if necessary
