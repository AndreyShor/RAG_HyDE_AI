of single-electron orbitals ϕl : R3 →R:
Φil(r) = ϕl(ri).

While the orbitals being single-electron functions en-
ables efficient single-electron updates and Laplacian
calculations of the wave function in O(nel2) and
O(nel3), respectively [6], their constrained functional
form prohibits the accurate representation of strongly
correlated systems [7].
In NN-VMC, one lifts this constraint by replacing the
single-electron orbitals with many-electron neural net-
works hi : Rnel×3 →Rndim multiplied with envelope
functions φl : R3 →R to ensure the correct long-range
behavior:
Φil(r) = (hi(r)T wl)φl(ri),

The ith electron’s embedding hi(r) depends in this
formulation on the position of all other electrons,
indicated by the (multi-)set {rj}j̸=i.
By choosing
permutation-equivariant architectures like graph neu-
ral networks [8, 9], or transformers [10] for h, antisym-
metry is preserved. For several small molecules, NN-
VMC achieves energy estimates outperforming conven-
tional ‘gold-standard’ methods such as Coupled Clus-
ters (CCSD(T)) or Multireference Configuration Inter-
action (MRCI) [3, 11].
However, as the orbital ma-
trix elements depend on all electrons, the Laplacian
requires O(nel4) operations, and efficient low-rank up-
dates are impossible.
Several fruitful improvements
have reduced the cost of NN-VMC, accelerating each
optimization step [12, 13], reducing the number of op-
timization steps required [14, 15], or amortizing the
cost across several systems [16, 17]. Nevertheless, none
of these change the overall computational complexity,
and system sizes studied by NN-VMC are typically still
limited to nel ≈80 in 10,000 GPU hours [10].
In this work, we connect the favorable computational
scaling of conventional VMC and the accuracy of NN-
VMC by introducing a novel neural wave function
based on finite-range embeddings (FiRE). FiRE re-
duces the computational scaling of NN-VMC by O(nel)
to O(nel3), yielding speed-ups of ≈10× for relevant
system sizes.
This enables the application to larger
systems at lower runtimes while maintaining highly ac-
curate relative energies, yielding a new ‘gold standard’
for fast and accurate ab-initio electronic structure cal-
culations.
As electron interactions are most pronounced at short
ranges, we focus the electron’s embedding on its vicin-
ity by limiting its dependence on the electrons within
some cutoff c. Thus, instead of the extrema of single-
electron conventional VMC and all-electron NN-VMC,
FiRE defines the ith electron’s embedding, from which
the orbital matrix Φ(r) is derived (Eq. (3)), via the
neighborhood Nri defined by the cutoff c ∈R+:
hi(r) = h(ri, {rj}j∈Nri),
(5)
Nri = {j | j ̸= i ∧|ri −rj| ≤c} .
(6)
This ansatz can trivially represent single-electron or-
bitals (Eq. (2)), including arbitrarily delocalized or-
bitals, by letting c = 0, i.e, Nri = ∅. Further, thanks to
the dependence on the close-by electrons, FiRE is a su-
