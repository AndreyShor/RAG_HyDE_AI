cle consisting of one active phase and its following
inactive phase2. To minimize the influence of ini-
tial transients, our analysis considers only cycles
occurring after 0.1 Gyr in each simulation.
The fiducial simulation exhibits a duty cycle
of 5.8% with a single-cycle timescale of 275.2 Myr.
In contrast, the noSNfb simulation demonstrates a
much lower duty cycle of 0.43% with substantially
shorter cycles of 2.7 Myr, indicating more rapid
cycling with briefer active phases. The noAGNfb
simulation maintains persistently high AGN lumi-
nosity throughout the simulation period, resulting
in a 100% duty cycle and a single-cycle timescale
exceeding the simulation duration. These results
can be evaluated against observational constraints:
multiple studies indicate typical AGN duty cycles
of several percent with characteristic timescales
of order 102 Myr (Greene & Ho 2007; Ho 2009;
Kauffmann & Heckman 2009; Conroy & White
2012). The fiducial model‚Äôs characteristics align
well with these observational constraints, while

the dramatically different duty cycle patterns in
noSNfb and noAGNfb models suggest they do not
accurately represent AGN activity in real galaxies.
3.6. Mass growth of the black hole
Fig. 7 shows the time evolution of the black hole
mass ùëÄBH in the fiducial, noSNfb, and noAGNfb
simulations. The noAGNfb simulation, due to the
lack of AGN feedback, fails to expel gas from the
central regions, leading to a continuous accretion of
gas onto the BH. As a result, noAGNfb exhibits the
most rapid growth in ùëÄBH, with the BH mass in-
creasing by 172% over the course of the simulation.
On the other hand, the fiducial and noSNfb sim-
ulations, which include AGN feedback, show more
moderate growth in ùëÄBH, with the BH mass in-
creasing by 5.7% and 2.2%, respectively. The BH
mass growth in different simulations is consistent
with the AGN duty cycle and the AGN luminosity
patterns, e.g., the BH growth in fiducial shows
a step-like pattern, with each step corresponding
to a burst of AGN activity, while the BH growth in
noAGNfb is more continuous and rapid. The results
suggest that AGN feedback plays a crucial role in
regulating the BH growth, preventing the BH from
growing too rapidly and maintaining the galaxy in
a quiescent state.
A notable finding is that the BH mass growth in
noSNfb is slightly lower than in fiducial, despite
the absence of SN feedback in the former. This re-
sult suggests that SN feedback in the fiducial
simulation may enhance gas accretion onto the
BH by driving turbulence and facilitating turbu-
lent compression and mixing-induced cooling in
the ISM, which promotes the formation of cool gas
that fuels BH accretion. In contrast, the noSNfb
simulation with AGN feedback alone maintains an
almost axisymmetric gas distribution with signif-
icantly reduced turbulence, resulting in less effi-
cient cooling. Our analysis confirms that the gas
cooling rate within the central region (‚â≤5 pc) in
noSNfb is approximately two orders of magnitude
lower than in fiducial, leading to reduced cool
gas formation and consequently lower BH accre-
