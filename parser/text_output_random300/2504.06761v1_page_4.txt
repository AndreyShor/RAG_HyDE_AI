Figure 1. Geometry of a single hairpin vortex. (a) Front and (b) side views of the hairpin vortex centerline.
(c) Vortex surface and a segment of a single hairpin vortex tube with variable thickness. The 3D hairpin
vortex is visualized by VSF isosurface (𝜙𝑣= 0.1, blue) with embedded vortex lines (red solid). An enlarged
schematic of the vortex tube segment is shown, where the vorticity is constructed in curved cylindrical
coordinates (𝜁, 𝜌, 𝜃). The vortex centerline C (green dash-dotted) is described in the Frenet–Serret frame
(𝑻, 𝑵, 𝑩). On each cross section of the vortex tube, the vorticity follows a Gaussian distribution with a
continuously varying standard deviation 𝜎.
The vorticity field of the hairpin vortex is constructed around the centerline C given
by (2.2) (as shown in figure 1(c)), using the curved cylindrical coordinate system (𝜁, 𝜌, 𝜃)
surrounding the vortex centerline C. The vorticity distribution for hairpin vortex tubes with
variable thickness (Xiong & Yang 2020; Shen et al. 2023, 2024) is specified as

from 𝑵(𝑠) in the plane 𝑆𝐶spanned by 𝑵(𝑠) and 𝑩(𝑠). These unit vectors, along with the
tangent 𝑻(𝑠), form the Frenet–Serret frame on C. The two terms in (2.3) correspond to the
vorticity flux and tube thickness components of 𝝎, respectively. The vector field constructed
by (2.3) is proved to be divergence-free (Shen et al. 2023, 2024). The radius 𝑅𝑣of the
constructed tubular region is large enough to ensure that almost all circulation is included.
The Lagrangian dynamics of hairpin vortex formation in wall turbulence (Zhao et al. 2016)
suggest that vortex tubes near the wall are thicker. Accordingly, we define the vortex core
size as
𝜎(𝜁) = 𝜎0 [1 −𝐶𝜎cos(𝜁)] ,
