γγ = 2(kµk′ν + kνk′µ −(k · k′)gµν −iλℓϵµναβkαk′β) ,
(1.23)
for which the antisymmetric part is fully proportional to the lepton helicity λℓ. The other tensors
are then:
Lµν
γZ = (Vℓ+ λℓAℓ)Lµν
γγ ,
(1.24)
Lµν
ZZ = (Vℓ+ λℓAℓ)2Lµν
γγ ,
(1.25)
Lµν
WW = (1 + λℓIW )2Lµν
γγ ,
(1.26)
with the vector-vector Vℓand axial-vector Aℓcoupling defined as in Eq. (1.11). In the case
of electroweak interaction, the part proportional to the lepton helicity does not correspond
anymore to the full antisymmetric part (or parity violating); however the antisymmetric terms
proportional to the helicity, have exactly the same tensor structure as the ones independent of
λℓ, and similar for the symmetric ones. In the limit Q2 ≪M2
Z the contributions from the Z
boson are suppressed. We refer to this case as electromagnetic (EM) DIS.
The last and more involving part of Eq. (1.20) is the hadronic tensors W µν
j . For the unpolarized
case the kinematic constraints suggest us to decompose it as a linear combination of terms
gµν, P µP ν, qµqν, P µqν, qµP ν and ϵµναβqαP β. A slightly more complicated structure is foreseen
for the hadron spin Sµ dependent part; 3 however, since we have assumed massless leptons, we
can use the contraction Lµνqµ = 0, to simplify the W µν decomposition. Following Ref. [27], we
can write
