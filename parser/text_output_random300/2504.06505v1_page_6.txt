FIG. 1. Adversarial training framework of dynamic matching. Trajectory ensembles are separately generated from 
the all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics and coarse-grained (CG) model. The classifier network 𝑓! is trained to 
discriminate between mapped AA trajectories and CG trajectories. Concurrently, the CG model parameters are 
optimized to minimize the classifier’s ability to distinguish between the two ensembles. Through this adversarial 
interplay, the dynamic and thermodynamic of the CG model is aligned with the reference AA system. 
 
Network Architectures: 
In this framework, we are training two networks: the classifier network and the potential network, 
which characterize the interaction potential between CG beads. 
Classifier network: The classifier network takes a trajectory {𝑹@, 𝑹+, ⋯, 𝑹-} and predicts whether this 
trajectory is from AA or CG simulations. Here 𝑹2 ∈ℝAB is the CG coordinate or the mapped atomic 
representation at time 𝑡. To ensure the scalability of the network structure, the classifier first uses an 
equivariant graph neural network (GNN) to encode individual frame 𝑹2  into a graph representation

, characterizing the change of position during the 
simulations (Fig. 2A).  To ensure the effective representation of these features and respect the rotational 
and translational equivariance property of the system,  we adopted the Neural Equivariant Interatomic 
Potentials (NequIP)31 network. NequIP is an equivariant graph neural network (GNN) specifically designed 
to encode atomic environments. It processes node features (atoms) and edge features (interatomic 
relationships) in a manner that inherently accounts for rotational and translational symmetries. By 
incorporating these symmetries directly into its architecture, NequIP offers an efficient and physically 
consistent framework for processing molecular configurations, making it well-suited for encoding 
molecular representations in simulations.
