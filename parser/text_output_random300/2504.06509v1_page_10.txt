size relationship, this suggests that variations in B' also impact A' by modifying θ0, as 
described by: A′ ∝
1
θ0  ∝ Hk −Hext ∝B′. To account for these variations, A'/B' is plotted 
as a function of MTJ size in Fig. 4(d). The ratio A’/B’ increases with the increasing device 
size, suggesting more efficient switching at smaller size device. Notably from equation (2) 
and (3), 
A′
B′  = 
A
B ∝ (
1+α2
α ).  For damping values much smaller than 1, this simplifies to 
∝ 1/α. The observed trend indicates that smaller devices exhibit a higher effective 
damping constant in the single domain model.  
 
Faster switching speed benefits from the larger effective damping 
 
 
FIG. 5 | Illustration of the torque direction and the simulation result. (a) (left): Torque 
orientation in STT-induced switching. The anti-damping-like torque must overcome the 
damping-like torque to induce switching. (a) (right): Torque orientation in voltage-
induced switching. The effective field reverses, as does the damping-like torque. The 
torque drives the local magnetic moment toward the new Heff direction to minimize 
energy. (b) Simulation results showing switching time as a function of the damping 
constant. Four cases are considered: Case 1: A single free layer. Case 2-4: A coupled 
system where the free layer interacts with the coupling layer. Specifically, Case 2: HCP=50 
mT, Hk2=500 mT, Case 3: HCP = 25 mT, Hk2 = 50 mT, Case 4: HCP = 50 mT, Hk2 = 50 mT. 
In all cases, a higher damping constant results in shorter switching times. The introduction 
of coupling accelerates switching, and the trajectory of the coupling layer further 
influences the magnitude of this effect.
