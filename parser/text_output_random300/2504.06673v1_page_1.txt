Isolated atoms as well as molecules at equilibrium are presumed to be simple from the point
of view of quantum computational complexity. Here we show that the process of chemical bond
formation is accompanied by a marked increase in the quantum complexity of the electronic ground
state. By studying the hydrogen dimer H2 as a prototypical example, we demonstrate that when two
hydrogen atoms form a bond, a specific measure of quantum complexity exhibits a pronounced peak
that closely follows the behavior of the binding energy. This measure of quantum complexity, known
as magic in the quantum information literature, reflects how difficult it is to simulate the state using
classical methods. This observation suggests that regions of strong bonding formation or breaking
are also regions of enhanced intrinsic quantum complexity. This insight suggests a connection of
quantum information measures to chemical reactivity and advocates the use of stretched molecules
as a quantum computational resource.
Introduction—Quantum entanglement is a fundamen-
tal feature of many-body physics and quantum chem-
istry, reflecting nonclassical correlations between con-
stituents [1–3].
It has become a key diagnostic in a
wide range of systems—from condensed matter to molec-
ular bonds—often quantified by measures such as the von
Neumann entropy or Renyi entropies of reduced density
matrices [4]. For example, in molecular systems such as
the hydrogen molecule H2, entanglement between elec-
trons is negligible when the atoms are far apart or nearly
fused into a single nucleus, but grows as a covalent bond
forms. However, it is now understood that entanglement
alone is not a sufficient indicator of a quantum state’s
computational complexity or quantumness [5, 6]. There
exist highly entangled yet classically simulable states, no-
tably the so-called stabilizer states that can be produced
by Clifford gates—transformations belonging to the nor-
malizer of the Pauli group—and efficiently simulated on
a classical computer via the Gottesman-Knill theorem
[7–9]. In other words, entanglement by itself does not
guarantee quantum advantage.
The resource that ele-
vates a quantum state beyond stabilizer dynamics is re-
ferred to as non-stabilizerness or magic, as described by
the resource theory of stabilizer quantum computation
[5, 6, 10]. Stabilizer states and Clifford operations are
considered free since they can be simulated efficiently on
a classical computer, whereas non-stabilizer states pro-
vide the essential resource for transcending classical sim-
ulability. Magic can be quantified by various monotones
that do not increase under stabilizer operations; one con-
venient measure is the mana, defined via the negativity
of the state’s discrete Wigner function [6]. Indeed, sta-
bilizer states possess a positive Wigner function, and for
pure states, mana vanishes if and only if the state is a sta-
bilizer state—a discrete analog of Hudson’s theorem link-
ing positive Wigner representations to Gaussian states,
thereby underlining that negativity in the quasiprobabil-
ity distribution is essential for a state to supply quantum
computational advantage.
Besides mana, other magic
measures have been proposed, such as the robustness of
magic [11–13] and the stabilizer Renyi entropies [14, 15].
Therefore, magic indicates the quantum overhead inher-
ent in accurately modeling a system. If a molecular sys-
tem has low magic, then a classical method might suffice.
High magic, on the other hand, flags the need for quan-
tum computational resources.
In parallel, quantum information concepts have begun
to permeate the study of molecules and chemical bond-
ing. The process of bond formation involves superposi-
tion of atomic configurations and entanglement between
electrons. Measures such as entanglement entropy have
been used to characterize these correlations in chemical
systems. Rissler, Noack, and White [1] applied quantum
information theory in chemistry by introducing orbital
mutual information as a measure of electron interactions
between orbitals, a concept that not only successfully
identifies chemical bond patterns but also aids in opti-
mizing DMRG algorithms. Building on this foundation,
Boguslawski et al.
[2] further developed the approach
by calculating one- and two-electron entropies for molec-
ular wavefunctions, thereby providing a more intuitive
picture of electron correlation that informs the selection
of active spaces. Recognizing the complexity of electron
interactions, Ding et al. [16] refined these ideas by dis-
entangling total orbital correlations into distinct classi-
cal and quantum components, which raised important
questions regarding the genuine role of entanglement in
chemical bonds. In a complementary effort, Szalay et al.
[4] introduced a multiorbital correlation framework that
utilizes genuine multipartite entanglement measures and
clustering algorithms to reveal multi-center bonding pat-
terns and to highlight the limitations of traditional bond-
ing descriptions. Extending these insights to a more nu-
anced bonding analysis, Ding, Matito, and Schilling [3]
proposed the concept of maximally entangled atomic or-
bitals (MEAOs), demonstrating that entanglement pat-
