Figure 4. Junction states in rhombohedral trilayer on a rhombohedral half-crystal with applied electric field.
a. Visualisation of the heterostructure. The layers are colour coded as a key to panel b, and the grey shading represents
strength of the electric field screened by the layers of the crystal. The trilayer is ABC stacked when considered in isolation,
with the overall stacking sequence of the heterostructure determined by the stacking configuration at the interface. b. The

for rhombohedral trilayer graphene on top of a rhombohedral half-crystal with the
interface stacking parametrized by the sliding parameter λ like in Fig. 3. An out-of-plane electric field E0 is applied to the
heterostructure such that eE0c = 0.1γ1. The amount of green, red and blue colour reflects the fraction of the electronic states
localised on the two surface layers (J + 2 and J + 3) of the heterostructure, the two layers either side of the physical interface
(J and J + 1), and the J −1 and J −2 layers of the heterostructure respectively. The transparency of the colour at each point
varies linearly, scaled by the total density of states across these six layers of the heterostructure.

could be probed either explicitly by moving one of the
crystals or by investigating differently stacked local do-
mains.

METHODS
A.
Calculating the density of states
We calculate our (layer- or sublattice-resolved if nec-
essary) electronic density of states results by embedding
the four-layer junction region between two semi-infinite
rhombohedral half-crystal surfaces. This is done via cal-
culation of the junction Green’s function GJ:
GJ(E, q) =

E −HJ(q) −ΣL(E, q) −ΣR(E, q)
−1 ,

where HJ is the 8×8 junction Hamiltonian describing
only layers J −1 to J + 2, and ΣL and ΣR are embed-
ding potentials accounting exactly for the influence of the
rhombohedral half-crystals either side of the four-layer
junction region. We use the Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure
tight-binding model [30] to construct HJ, but for Fig. 1
of the main text limit ourselves to the in-plane nearest
neighbour hopping γ0 and the vertical interlayer hopping
γ1. Labelling the red sites as sublattice A and the blue
sites as sublattice B, the general form in the basis of the
Bloch states on sublattices AJ−1, BJ−1, AJ, BJ, AJ+1,
BJ+1, AJ+2, BJ+2, is

Moreover, HJ+1 = HJ+2 = H0 for the AB|CA, AB|BC,
and AB|AB junctions, while HJ+1 = HJ+2 = HT

for the AB|AC and AB|BA configurations in which the
half-crystals to the right of the junction are inverted.
The off-diagonal blocks Vj,j+1 describe interlayer cou-
pling between neighbouring layers j and j + 1.
Here,
VJ−1,J = VJ+1,J+2 = V = 1
2(σx −iσy). The coupling
matrix VJ,J+1 depends on the configuration of the lay-
ers at the junction: for the AB|CA junction, we have
VJ,J+1 = V ; for AB|BC, VJ,J+1 = γ1σ0; for AB|AB,
VJ,J+1 = V T ; for AB|AC, VJ,J+1 = 1
2γ1(σ0 + σz), and
for AB|BA, VJ,J+1 = γ1σx. We use the values γ0 = 3.16
eV and γ1 = 0.38 eV [47] and the in-plane lattice param-
eter a = 2.46 ˚A [30].
