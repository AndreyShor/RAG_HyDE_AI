This result will be a consequence of the more detailed Proposition 6.1. With this chain rule
it is then possible to show that discrete EDB solutions are equivalent to ODE solutions, i.e., in
the discrete setting the Energy-Dissipoation Principle holds.
Theorem 4.3 (Discrete EDB and (1.3)). A function c ∈AC([0, T]; M+(XN)) is a solution to
the discrete reaction-diﬀusion system (1.3) if and only if the triple (c, F, J) with F and J given
by (6.4) is a discrete EDB solution in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.8.
We refer to the end of Section 6.1 for the proof.
We now turn to the continuum system, where we need to restrict the stoichiometric vectors
αr and βr, which was not the case in the discrete setting. At the end of this section we will
shortly address the case where we have a priori bounds in L∞, which is again a case, where
arbitrary stoichiometric vectors are allowed.
In our analysis we will use two levels of assumptions: the ﬁrst is needed for deriving the
lower-limit estimates and the second, which is slightly stronger, will be used to derive the
abstract chain rule.
Assumption 4.4 (for lower-limit estimates). The reaction coeﬃcients satisfy
∀r ∈R :
1
2
αr + βr
1 ≤pcrit := 1 + 2/d.
(4.A1)
Assumption 4.5 (for chain rule inequality). The reaction coeﬃcients satisfy
∀r ∈R :
|αr|1 ≤pcrit,
|βr|1 ≤pcrit,
1
2|αr+βr|1 ≨pcrit.
(4.A2)
Example 4.6. In all space dimensions we have pcrit > 1. Hence, our analysis covers linear
exchange reactions
X1 ⇋X2
where |α|1 = |β|1 = 1
2|α+β|1 = 1.
In space dimensions d ≤2 we have pcrit = 3 or pcrit = 2, which allows to handle binary reactions
with j = c1c2 −c3, i.e.,
X1+X2 ⇋X3
where |α|1 = 2,
|β|1 = 1,
1
2|α+β|1 = 3/2,
or the semi-conductor reaction with j = cneqcpos −1, i.e.,
Xneg + Xpos ⇋∅
where |α|1 = 2,
|β|1 = 0,
1
2|α+β|1 = 1.
Having ﬁxed the assumptions, we now state the convergence of the discrete gradient systems
to the continuum gradient system.
Theorem 4.7 (Convergence and lower limit of energy-dissipation functionals). Consider
(cN, F N, JN) ∈CEN such that the uniform bounds supN∈N ess supt∈[0,T] EN(cN(t)) < ∞and
supN∈N DN(cN, F N, JN) < ∞hold true. Moreover, assume that the reactions satisfy (4.A1).
Then, there exists (ρ, f, j) ∈CE with f ∈L1([0, T] × Ydiﬀ) and j ∈L1([0, T] × Yreact) such
that (up to a subsequence) we have ιNcN →ρ strongly in L1([0, T] × X), ιN,diﬀF N ⇀f weakly
in L([0, T] × Ydiﬀ), and ιN,reactJN ⇀j weakly in L1([0, T] × Yreact).
