(a) Photograph of the
nanowire superconducting microwave resonator. (b) S21 spec-
trum of the resonator. The fourth resonance mode exhibits
extremely weak coupling, resulting in a barely visible dip.
(c) Changes in 1/Q for each mode as a function of probe
microwave power. The data points represent measured val-
ues, and the curves are fits using the TLS saturation model:
1/Q = 1/Q0 + A/
p
1 + (PMW/Pc)β where Q0, A, Pc, β are
constants, and PMW is the probe power. For the fundamen-
tal mode, superconductivity begins to break down at probe
powers above −70 dBm, making higher-power measurements
infeasible. For other modes, 1/Q reaches saturation at ap-
proximately −60 dBm.
lowing, 1/Q denotes the inverse of the internal quality
factor. Subsequent measurements are performed in the
high-power regime, where TLS loss saturation behavior
is observed (see Supplementary Notes for details on mea-
surements at different microwave powers).
Optical illumination experiments are performed in
a custom-built laser-scanning optical system integrated
into a dilution refrigerator at a base temperature of ap-
proximately 15 mK. A laser beam, focused on the sample
surface using an objective lens, is scanned via a two-axis
galvanometer mirror. The modulation of the transmit-
ted microwave signal by the laser irradiation is measured
with a vector network analyzer (VNA) to image the struc-
ture of the superconducting nanowire. Since the focused
laser locally alters the resonance spectrum, it is possible
to visualize the nanowire as shown in Fig. 2(b). Notably,
this scanning method does not rely on optical detectors.
While the relatively large pad structures of the resonator
can be observed with a camera, the nanowire structure it-
self cannot be identified through reflected light or photo-
luminescence (PL). Instead, the transmitted microwave
signal serves as the detection signal for identifying the
position of the nanowire.

FIG. 2. Optical response mapping of the resonator and optical
power dependence of the resonator spectrum. (a) Schematic
of the laser-scanning microwave spectroscopy system.
The
system uses (1) a CMOS camera and (4) a three-axis piezo
stage for the coarse alignment in the x−y directions as well as
for focusing on the resonator surface. (2) A galvanometer mir-
ror scans the laser beam focused onto the sample surface using
(3) an objective lens. The input microwave signal is attenu-
ated by 52 dB and subsequently amplified at both cryogenic
and room temperatures before detection. (b) 2D optical re-
sponse map of the superconducting nanowire. The 2D optical
response map of the resonator is constructed by sweeping the
laser illumination position using the galvanometer mirror and
extracting the minimum value of the S21 spectrum at each
coordinate. The blue line indicates an area that appears to
correspond to the nanowire. (c) Optical power dependence of
the resonance spectrum in the red-outlined area (Area3) for
the fundamental mode. (d) Optical power dependence of 1/Q
and ∆fr/fr. The 1/Q data are linearly fitted. The ∆fr/fr
data are connected with dashed lines because ∆fr/fr exhibits
a nonlinear power dependence.
The horizontal red dashed
line corresponds to the resonance frequency without the op-
tical illumination.
laser, determined by the objective lens, is sλ/NA ∼0.6s
µm, enabling irradiation positional accuracy of approx-
imately ∼1 µm (see Supplementary Discussions for de-
tails on the resolution of the experimental system). Here,
s ≃0.5−0.6 is a prefactor that depends on the definition
of the resolution. The laser used in this experiment has
a wavelength of 515 nm, which is sufficiently larger than
the superconducting gap energy of NbTiN (2∆0 = 2.15
meV).
Regarding the first resonance mode, the optical re-
