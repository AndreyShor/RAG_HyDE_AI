Then we can define the non-symmetric regular shock reflection solution.
Definition 4.7. For given angles θi
w with θi
w ∈(θd
w, π
2 ) for i = 1, 2, an entropy solution (ρ, v)
is called a non-symmetric regular shock reflection solution of the non-symmetric regular shock
reflection problem if (ρ, v) satisfies the following additional properties:
(i) If state (2) at P0 and state (3) at P1 are both supersonic, i.e., |v2(P0)| > c2 and |v2(P1)| >
c3, the solution has the supersonic reflection structure as in Fig. 4.3 at both points P0 and
P1. If state (2) at P0 and state (3) at P1 are both subsonic or sonic, i.e., |v2(P0)| ≤c2 and
|v2(P1)| ≤c3, the solution has the subsonic reflection structure as in Fig. 4.4.
(ii) The reflected-diffracted shock curve P0P1 is C1 up to its endpoints.
(iii) (ρ, v) is continuous in Ω∩Nr(Γshock ∪Γ2
sonic ∪Γ3
sonic) for the supersonic reflections, and in
Ω∩Nr(Γshock) for the subsonic reflection, for some r > 0.
(iv) The solution coincides with states (0), (1), (2), and (3) in their respective regions:

where ξ0
1 > 0 is the location of the incident shock S0 on the self-similar plane, and
lim
ξ∈Ω, ξ→P0(ρ, v)(ξ) = (ρ2, v2)(P0)
if state (2) at P0 is subsonic or sonic,
lim
ξ∈Ω, ξ→P1(ρ, v)(ξ) = (ρ3, v3)(P1)
if state (3) at P1 is subsonic or sonic.
(v) (4.3) holds for some C > 0, where Γsonic is replaced by Γ2
sonic ∪Γ3
sonic, v on the curves is
taken from the Ω–side, and ν is the outer normal with respect to Ω.
(vi) The flow is pseudo-subsonic in Ωon and near Γshock, except for the sonic points P2 and
P3 if they exist, point P0 if state (2) is sonic at P0, and point P1 if state (3) is sonic at P1.
Remark 4.8. Similarly as stated in Remark 4.4, curve Γshock cannot be a straight segment,
which will be addressed in more detail in Step 3 of the proof of Theorem 4.10 below. Moreover,
if θ1
w = θ2
w, the symmetric regular shock reflection problem is a special case of the non-symmetric
regular shock reflection problem, by defining (ρext, vext)(ξ1, −ξ2)) := (ρext, vext)(ξ1, ξ2) for any
ξ = (ξ1, ξ2) ∈Λ.
Therefore, we only prove the low regularity of the non-symmetric regular
reflection solution below, since the low regularity for the symmetric case follows directly.
Remark 4.9. For the supersonic reflections, it follows from conditions (ii)–(iv) of Definition
4.7 and the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions that (ρ, v) are continuous across the sonic arcs Γ2
sonic ∪
Γ3
sonic:
lim
ξ∈Ω, ξ→P(ρ, v)(ξ) = (ρ2, vi)(P)
for any P ∈Γi
sonic
if |vi(P0)| > ci for i = 2, 3.
Theorem 4.10. Let (ρ, v) be a non-symmetric regular shock reflection solution in the sense of
Definition 4.7. Assume that (ρ, v) satisfy the following:
(i) The reflected-diffracted shock Γshock = P2P3 is C2 in its relative interior, and C1 up to
endpoints P2 and P3, where P2 (or P3) is replaced by P0 (or P1) if the subsonic shock
reflection occurs at P0 (or P1);
