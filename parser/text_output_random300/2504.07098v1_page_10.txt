TABLE II: The number of modes and pseudospin s satisfying the boundary conditions φ(±∞) = 0 on the infinite interval −∞< x < ∞
and φ(0) = φ(∞) = 0 on the semi-infinite interval 0 ≤x < ∞depending on the asymptotic values mL,R, vL,R ∈C via the quantities
ML,R, KL,R, and WL,R defined in Eqs. (11) and (11c). The modes show exponential decay if KL,R = 0 or exponentially damped
oscillations if KL,R ̸= 0 for x →∓∞. In the case mL,R, vL,R ∈R, which gives sgn(ML,R) = sgn(mL,R) and KL,R = |Im(qL,R)|, the
modes show exponential decay if v2

Local properties and local topological invariant
In all cases, being featureless and nonfeatureless with short or long hair, the long-distance behavior x ≫w of the zero modes
are completely described by Eq. (8) with the exponents µ and κ. In particular, the different asymptotic regimes are completely
determined by the quantities ML,R, KL,R, and WL,R defined in Eqs. (11) and (11c) which are in turn determined by the values
of the fields m(x) and v(x) at long distances x →±∞. However, to gain a physical intuition on the wavefunction of the zero
modes at short distances x ≲w, one can introduce the following functions
M(x) =|Re(
p
v(x)2 + m(x))| −|Re(v(x))|,
