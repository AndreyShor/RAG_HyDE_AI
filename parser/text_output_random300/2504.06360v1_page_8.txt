FIG. 2.
The deviation of the condensate density from its
mean value at t = 25 ps and t = 65 ps. The initial condi-
tions are taken in the form of a weak noise ovelapped with
the spatially uniform condensate with the wavevector of the
value κ = 1.3 µm−1 oriented along the x axis. Panels (c) and
(d) show the spatial spectra of the whole field for t = 25 ps
and t = 65 ps correspondingly.
The white curves in pan-
els (c) and (d) indicate the border of the instability range
(inside the curve) calculated by formula (19) in the main
text. The other parameters are g = 6 · 10−3meV · µm2 and
λ = 1.4 · 10−3µm4 · ps−1.
moving at the same velocity as in the beginning (up to
the precision of our numerical simulations).
We also observed that, in full accordance with formula
(19) in the main text, the condensate moving at super-
sonic velocity is unstable and perturbations start grow-
ing. This process is illustrated in Fig. 2(a),(b) showing
the deviation of the condensate density from its average
value for the intermediate time (quasi-linear stage of the
instability) and at a relatively long time when the insta-
bility is practically saturated.
It can be noticed that vertically oriented stripes ap-
pear at first. The period of the stripe is defined by the
wavevector at which the instability growth rate given by
(19) reaches its maximum. Panel (c) of the figure shows
the spectrum of the field. This spectrum has a very nar-
row maximum located at kx = 1.3 µm−1, ky = 0, which
corresponds to the initial state of the condensate. The
white curve shows the border of the instability in k space.
It is clear that there is indeed an increase in spectral har-
monics inside the curve.
The developed stage of the instability is shown in
panel (b).
There are some large-scale variations of
the condensate density, but no developed quasiperiodic
stripes are seen anymore. The spectrum of the field is
shown in (d). The spectrum is nearly completely local-

FIG. 3. The temporal development of the one-dimensional
condensate with κ = 1.3 µm−1. The initial conditions are
the spatially uniform condensate of density ρ0 = 50 µm−2
perturbed by weak noise. Panel (a) shows evolution of the
spectrum and panel (b) shows evolution of the field. The other
parameters are g = 6·10−3meV ·µm2, λ = 1.4·10−3µm4·ps−1.
ized near k = 0. Thus, we can say that the development
of the instability is the mechanism leading to the decel-
eration of the condensate.
The

of
the
instability
in
the
one-
dimensional condensate is shown in Fig. 3.
It is seen
that at time t ≈65 ps the quasiperiodic excitations de-
velop. In the spectral representation, it corresponds to
the formation of the second maximum, which is less in-
tense and much wider than the first one.
Finally, the
initial spectral line disappears and only harmonics with
small k survive. Let us remark that for g = 0 the short-
scale excitations disappear much faster than for relatively
large g. This can be an indication that some of the short-
scale excitations are, actually, dark solitons (1D analogue
of vortices) forming in the condensate.
The evolution of the field and the spectrum of the con-
densate droplets
The evolutions of the field and the spectrum of prop-
agating condensate droplets are shown in panels (a) and
(b) of Fig. 4 respectively. The shape of the condensate
droplet is seen to change during propagation. First, it
gets wider, and second, it becomes asymmetric.
Both
the spreading rate and the rate of asymmetry develop-
ment increase with the maximum density of the droplet.
In the spectral domain, it is seen that the range of
the wavevectors filled by the condensate shifts towards
smaller k’s during propagation.
This means decelera-
tion of the droplet because in these regimes the velocity
of the droplet is very accurately approximated by the
group velocity of linear waves calculated at the central
wavevector.
To show how the density of the condensate affects the
mean value of the wavevector and the width of the spatial
spectrum of the condensate, we calculate the dependen-
