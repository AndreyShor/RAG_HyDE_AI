Schr¨odinger’s cat state through free evolution dynam-
ics [19]. The Hamiltonian is described according to the
NMR formalism of a quadrupolar system I > 1/2 and
the eigenstates are compatible with the magnetic quan-
tum number m = I, I −1, · · · , −I + 1, −I. We write the
NMR Hamiltonian in the laboratory frame, described in
terms of two energy contributions given by
HNMR = −ℏ(ωL −ωrf)Iz + ℏωQ
6 (3I2
z −I2).
(1)
The first energy contribution is due to the Zeeman en-
ergy, which describes the interaction between the nuclear
magnetic moment, given by −ℏγ(Ix, Iy, Iz), and a strong
static magnetic field B0 along the z axis. Here, ℏis the
reduced Planck’s constant and B0 represents the inten-
sity of the static magnetic field, respectively. The second
energy contribution describes the interaction between the
quadrupole moment of the nuclei and an electric field
gradient around the nucleus, considering an anisotropy
oriented in the z-axis, and where ωQ is the quadrupolar
angular frequency.
Assuming the resonance condition ωrf = ωL, where
ωL = γB0 is the angular Larmor frequency and γ is the
gyromagnetic ratio of the nuclei, the NMR Hamiltonian
in Eq.(1) corresponds to the one-axis twisting model of
spin squeezing [20] written as

NMR = ℏωQ

(2)
where the term proportional to the quadratic spin opera-
tor, known as the Casimir energy contribution, −ℏωQ
6 I2,
is a constant factor and does not influence the generation
of spin squeezing.
In addition to generating spin squeezing, the Hamilto-
nian in Eq.(2) can also generate a Schr¨odinger cat state
within the framework of the atom–field interaction sce-
nario [21]. Specifically, the cat state emerges through the
free evolution dynamics at time τ =
π
ωQ , during which
the system undergoes a unitary transformation that pro-
duces a quantum superposition of spin coherent states,
commonly referred to as a Schr¨odinger’s cat state [19].
With the Hamiltonian established, the next step is to
define the quantum state of the system. In this case, it
is represented by a notation analogous to the well-known
spin coherent state but adapted to be compatible with a
nuclear spin system

where ζ = tan θ
2 exp(−iϕ) denotes the excitation param-
eter with 0 ≤θ ≤π and 0 ≤ϕ ≤2π. The spin coherent
state |ψ(0)⟩= |ζ(π/2, 0)⟩is selected as the initial state
and corresponds to a symmetric Wigner quasi-probability
distribution [21–23] in the spherical phase space around
the x axis. After transforming, the spin coherent state
suffers also a unitary transformation in terms of the
Hamiltonian of Eq.(2) and the quantum state achieves
the squeezing shape of the distribution probability on
the yz plane, now described on a rotated y′z′ basis [24].
To evaluate the degree of squeezing, we monitor the
squeezing parameter expressed as [18, 20, 25, 26]
ξ = (∆In)min

where (∆In)min represents the minimum variance of a
spin component In orthogonal to the mean spin ⟨I⟩. Ex-

are combinations of sums and products of the
spin operators Iz and Iy, depending on the orientation
of a vector n = (1, 0, 0) which is aligned along the x-
axis in a tridimensional space of the angular momentum
operator mean values.
In addition, we have the angle
αξ = 1
2 arctan (B/A) giving the geometrical orientation
of the squeezing [20, 26].
The spin squeezing parameter and the angle αξ are
determined by combinations of the values A, B, and C.
These values implicitly depend on the density matrix of
the quantum state, which can represent a coherent state,
a squeezed state, or a superposition of both. Further-
more, the expectation value of any operator O, denoted
in the Schr¨odinger picture, is given by ⟨O⟩= Tr(ρO),
where ρ denotes the density matrix. This leads to an im-
portant question: How does spin squeezing evolve as the
density matrix changes over time, due to relaxation pro-
cesses? Addressing this question requires analyzing the
relationship between relaxation mechanisms and their in-
fluence on the squeezing parameter, which ultimately af-
fects the quantum correlations, crucial for spin squeezing.

RELAXATION FORMALISM
At the onset of establishing the theoretical framework
for describing relaxation, several physical models have
been proposed for spin systems with I > 1/2, intro-
duced by J. Van Kranendonk [27], Yosida and Moriya
[28], Kondo and Yamashita [29], and Kochelaev [30].
However, a suitable approach to describe relaxation for
spin particles of more than two energy levels is through
Redfield theory [31]. Redfield theory is considered more
complete because it utilizes concepts from quantum me-
chanics emplying the density matrix formalism.
This
approach takes into account the relaxation rates among
the density matrix elements with the same coherence or-
der, and fluctuations, due to any external field or parti-
cle surrounding the quantum system, are mathematically
described and represented by spectral densities [32–34].
