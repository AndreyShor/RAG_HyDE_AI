where B, C, D are respectively 3×3, 2×2 and 2×2 real matrices with null diagonal and nonzero off-diagonal elements.
Since 2 × 2 matrices are always symmetrizable, let diag(µC)C and diag(µD)D be symmetric and consider also that
B is symmetrizable, i.e., diag(µB)B is symmetric. The second and third conditions of Thm. S5 are thus satisfied.
Moreover, the first and fourth conditions of Thm. S5 are obviously satisfied. Altogether Thm. S5 guarantees that the
Koopman generator possesses four monomial eigenfunctions
ψB(z) = zµB ,
ψ4(z) = z4 ,
ψC(z) = zµC ,
ψD(z) = zµD ,
(S31)
where
λB = i ˜ωB ,
λ4 = i ω4 ,
λC = i ˜ωC ,
λD = i ˜ωD
(S32)
and
˜ωB := (µB)1ω1 + (µB)2ω2 + (µB)3ω3 ,
˜ωC := (µC)1ω5 + (µC)2ω6 ,
˜ωD := (µD)1ω7 + (µD)2ω8 .
(S33)
To further specify the example, suppose that ω4, ˜ωB, ˜ωD ∈R \ {0} and ˜ωC = 0. Since ψC is a monomial eigenfunction
of null eigenvalue, it is a constant of motion and there are q = 3 monomial eigenfunctions with nonzero eigenvalues.
We can construct q −1 = 2 time-independent conserved monomials according to Lem. S5. The constants of motion
are zν1 and zν2, where V = UO for the 10 × 3 matrix U = (µB e4 µD) for e4 the unit vector with the fourth entry
being unity, V = (ν1 ν2), and O is a 3 × 2 matrix where the columns are linearly independent vectors which are
orthogonal to ˜ω = (˜ωB ω4 ˜ωD)⊤. For example, the matrix O can be of the form
O =


ω4

.
(S34)
Then, the monomial constants of motion would be zν1 = ψω4

CONSERVATION OF CROSS-RATIOS
In 1994, Watanabe and Strogatz found constants of motion for identical phase oscillators, shaping subsequent years
of theoretical studies on such oscillators. Fifteen years later [62], these constants of motion were linked to the cross-
ratios. The applicability of such outstanding results for phase oscillators on general heterogeneous networks, however,
remained elusive and one could doubt that it is even possible to have any constant of motion at all in such case. In the
last section, we found the necessary and sufficient conditions to conserved monomials; in this section, we provide such
conditions for the conservation of cross-ratios. The first three subsections introduce the cross-ratios and its properties
(functional independence and their joint invariance for the special linear algebra). Most importantly, Section III D
contains the proof of Theorem 2 from the main text while its corollaries are in Section III F.
A.
Introduction to cross-ratios
In this subsection, we present some facts about the cross-ratios (also called anharmonic ratio), which are central
quantities in the paper. The cross-ratio of four different points za, zb, zc, zd in C ∪{∞} is
cabcd(z) = (za, zb ; zc, zd) = (zc −za)(zd −zb)
(zc −zb)(zd −za)
