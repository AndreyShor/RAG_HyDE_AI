where Y′
t is an independent copy of Yt. In particular, by taking the limit as t →∞in the display
above, we obtain that for all s ≥0,
Us = e−s/2U0 + (1 −e−s)1/2Z ,
where U0 and Z are independent standard normal random variables. This is precisely the defining
property of a stationary Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process.
Returning to our setting, we show in Corollary D that there exists an R-valued process (Wγ,s)s≥0
with Wγ,0 = 0, which we refer to as the weight process, such that, for any s ≥0, the measure νγ,s
can be expressed as follows
νγ,s =
X
j∈N
eWγ,s,jwjδxj ,
where (xj, wj)j∈N enumerates (in an arbitrary manner) the atoms of the Poisson point measure
ηγ[µγc] as introduced in Definition 1.5, and the collection (Wγ,s,j)j∈N consists of i.i.d. copies of
Wγ,s. We emphasise that the spatial locations xi of the point masses are fixed once and for all and do
not change as s varies. The only aspect that evolves in the process νγ,s is the weights of the point
masses, whose dynamics are governed by the weight process as described above. Moreover, the mass
of each atom evolves independently of all the others.
To prove this result, we adopt a general framework where we consider the joint limit as t →∞of the
family of measures (µγ,t,i)i∈[n] defined as follows

where, the collection of processes (Wi,·)i∈[n]2 satisfies some suitable assumptions (see Assump-
tion 2.14 for details). Specifically, in Theorem C, we analyse the joint convergence of these types of
measures.
Remark 1.8. It is worth noting that for s ≥0, the convergence of the collection of measures
(µγ,t+s)t≥0 naturally fits within this general framework. This follows directly from the decomposition
Xt+s = Xt + Xt,t+s, together with the fact that the field Xt,t+s satisfies our assumptions.
Remark 1.9. One motivation for working within this general framework is that it facilitates our
companion paper [BH25], where we establish the uniqueness of the supercritical GMC measure.
Specifically, we show that if X(ε) denotes the convolution approximation of a ⋆-scale invariant field
at level ε, then, roughly speaking, X(e−t) ≈Xt + W(et·) for a smooth Gaussian field W that is
independent of X (see [BH25, Proposition B] for details).
The proof of Theorem C, in addition to relying on technical results from [Mad15], requires a fine
understanding of the structure of ⋆-scale invariant fields around their extremal points. Specifically,
consider a log-correlated Gaussian field X conditioned on two events: first, that its value at the
origin is comparable to the maximum of the field within an order-one region; second, that the origin
is a “mesoscopic maximum” within this region. Then, after shifting the coordinate system at this
maximum (so that the value at the origin becomes 0) and after a suitable rescaling, we want to study
the “shape of the field” in that region. This is the content of Theorem A, which describes the law of
the field governing the shape of the field X around a mesoscopic maximum. With this result in hand,
the precise form of the weight process (Wγ,s)s≥0, as given in (2.17), emerges quite naturally.
We emphasise that in the case of dimension d = 2, a similar investigation has been conducted for the
discrete Gaussian free field (DGFF) in [BL18]. However, their results rely heavily on the fact that the
DGFF is defined on the discrete grid Z2. There, one can condition a field on the origin being the
2Here, and in what follows, we write [n] = {1, . . . , n} and [n]0 = {0, 1, . . . , n}.
