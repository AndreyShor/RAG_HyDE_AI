Fig. 11. The 3D SWS map estimated using MFR-OCE on an ex vivo porcine cornea sample 
across different excitation frequencies: (a) 500 Hz, (b) 1000 Hz, (c) 1500 Hz, (d) 2000 Hz, and 
(e) 2500 Hz. 
The mean SWS of the porcine cornea, estimated using MFR-OCE, across the excitation 
frequencies is illustrated in Fig. 12 (data points). A power law equation with an exponent of 
0.33 is fitted with these values (black trendline). The excellent fit demonstrates that the 
dispersion behavior of the cornea can be accurately described by the power law model. The 
power law exponent of 0.33 indicates that the cornea exhibits moderate viscoelastic behavior, 
meaning that higher-frequency shear waves propagate faster due to the tissueâ€™s viscoelastic 
properties. The error bars represent the variability in the measurements, but the data points align 
well with the fitted power law model.
