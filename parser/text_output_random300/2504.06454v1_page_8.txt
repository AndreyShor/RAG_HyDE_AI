to 700 nm. The fundamental superconducting properties, Tc and µ0Hc2(0), are sum-
marized in Fig. 6. The dependence of Tc on Ts reveals a dome-like structure, with a
maximum Tc of 7.28 K observed at Ts=520 ◦C. The µ0Hc2(0) data strongly correlate
with the Ts-dependent Tc, indicating that higher Tc values lead to larger µ0Hc2(0) in
the thin ﬁlms.
Figure 7 illustrates the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of Jc for thin-ﬁlm samples fabri-
cated at various Ts values alongside data from the target sample (labeled as ”Bulk”).
A signiﬁcant enhancement in Jc is observed for all thin-ﬁlm samples compared to
the bulk sample. Notably, the thin-ﬁlm sample deposited at Ts=520 ◦C achieves Jc
> 1 MA/cm2, representing approximately 820 % and 790 % increases relative to the
bulk sample at 2.0 K (and 3.4 T) and 4.2 K (and 2 T), respectively. The red dashed
line (Jc=0.1 MA/cm2) represents the benchmark for superconductors in large-scale
