FIG. S5. Illustration of a graph with symmetry generators S1, ..., Sr from Lem. S10.
(A3) and one, two or three of them belong to Wη,
then both the cross-ratio cabcd and Sη[cabcd] are conserved and functionally independent.
B. If three vertices u, v, w ∈V \ {s} have
(B1) a unique incoming edge with weight As from s;
(B2) identical natural frequencies ω = ωs −2 Im(As);
(B3) and one or two of them belong to Wη
then both the cross-ratio csuvw and Sη[csuvw] are conserved and functionally independent.
Proof. A. Condition (A1) implies that the four vertices are mutually disconnected (Ajk = 0 for all j, k ∈{a, b, c, d}
with j ̸= k) as they can only have an incoming edge from the source. Therefore, condition (1) from Thm. S12 is
satisfied. Condition (A1) also highlights that the weights of these incoming edges are all equal to As, meaning that
condition 2 of Thm. S12 holds. Then, condition 3 of Thm. S12 is also fulfilled from condition (A2) and the fact that
Ajk = 0 for all j, k ∈{a, b, c, d} with j ̸= k. Altogether, Thm. S12 guarantees that K[cabcd] = 0, that is, cabcd is a
constant of motion. Lemma S10 shows that Sη = Kη −iωsLη
0 is a symmetry generator and condition (A3) ensures
that Sη[cabcd] is not zero. Therefore, KSη[cabcd] = SηK[cabcd] = 0, i.e., Sη[cabcd] is a new nontrivial constant of motion.
Since Kη depends on the source’s state zs, Sη and Sη[cabcd] also do. Therefore, Sη[cabcd] is functionally dependent of
cabcd, which only depends on za, zb, zc, zd.
B. Conditions (B1) and (B2) imply that all the conditions of Thm. S12 are fulfilled and hence, csuvw is conserved.
Then, condition (B3) guarantees that Sη[csuvw] is not zero and similarly to the part A of the proof, Sη[csuvw] is
conserved. If there are vertices other than u, v or w belonging to Wη, then Sη[csuvw] is functionally independent of
csuvw. If only one or two vertices among u, v or w are in Wη, the symmetry generator Sη can take the 6 different

Remark S30. A priori, one could hope to generate new constants of motion from the class of symmetry generators in
Lem. S10 and monomial eigenfunctions. However, if there is a subgraph with vertex set M supporting a monomial
eigenfunction, it must be a source and there is no way to make Sη act on only a subset of M. More precisely, M can
