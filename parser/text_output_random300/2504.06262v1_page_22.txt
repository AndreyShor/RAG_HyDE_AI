varying saturation leading to a refractive index change
determined by the local intensity distribution. Typically,
in the self-defocusing regime (achievable in strontium-
barium-niobate crystals with appropriate external field
orientation), this results in a reduction of the refractive
index in regions of high intensity, which can be concep-
tualized as the creation of repulsive optical potentials for
light (Boughdad, 2020; Boughdad et al., 2019).
Con-
versely, realizing attractive potentials (i.e., an increase
in refractive index in bright regions) can be achieved
through specific configurations such as inverting the ap-
plied external electric field in materials like SBN to enter
a self-focusing regime, or by utilizing background inco-
herent illumination to manipulate the effective nonlin-
earity.
In thermo-optic liquid it is actually possible to include
an object inside the medium (it is a liquid), therefore a
macroscopic modification of the refractive index can be
induced by choosing an object with a different index than
the liquid. This approach has been followed by (Vocke
et al., 2016).

A considerable advantage of fluids of light compared to
ultracold atomic gases is the simple access to the phase of
the field, using interferometric method like off-axis inter-
ferometry (Cuche et al., 1999; Fienup, 1982). This tech-
nique is widely in optics since it gives fast reconstruction
(possibly above 30 Hz) with high resolution.
The signal beam Es, which propagated through the non-
linear medium, is overlapped with a reference beam Er.
The resulting interference pattern is imaged on a camera
and can be expressed as follow:
Icam(r⊥) ∝|Es(r⊥)eiϕ(r⊥) + Er(r⊥)eik′
⊥r⊥|2 =
Is(r⊥) + Ir(r⊥)

where k′
⊥is the transverse wavevector of the reference
beam with respect to the signal.
The phase of Er is
ignored as it is set to not vary with r⊥.
In order to
demodulate the signal, we take the Fourier transform of
this expression, giving:
˜Icam(k⊥) = ˜Is(k⊥) + ˜Ir(k⊥)

The phase can be extracted from the sidebands, but the
difficulty is that the convolution product is hard to in-
vert. However, if one uses a very large reference beam
compared to the signal beam, its Fourier transform will
be much narrower than the one of the signal. We can
then approximate the Fourier transform of the reference
by a Dirac function, meaning that the convolution prod-
uct will simply shift the signal by k′
⊥in the Fourier plane.
In this scenario, the camera intensity in the Fourier do-
main becomes:
˜Icam(k⊥) ≃˜Is(k⊥) + ˜Ir(k⊥)

We then spatially filter the Fourier plane in order to
recover the information carried by the sidebands. This
is done with a band-pass filter ˜T(k⊥) around one of the
first sideband term, and by shifting the signal in Fourier
domain by −k′⊥to get rid of the off-axis term. By ap-
plying an inverse Fourier transform, we recover:
Eseiϕ(r⊥) ∗F−1 h
˜T

(r⊥).
(98)
If the band-pass filter ˜T(k⊥) has a circular shape, its
inverse Fourier transform, F−1 h
˜T
i
, corresponds to an
Airy function. This implies that the recovery process is
not perfect, as it degrades the spatial resolution of the
reconstructed field.
We select the largest possible re-
gion around the satellite peak in the Fourier plane which
still excludes the zeroth order. This fixes the choice of
the relative angle between signal and reference k′⊥so
that the satellite peak is (approximately) positioned at
