Figure 12: (a) Ground truth normal velocity components at t = 428. (b) Comparison
of the predicted normal velocity components for HOSVD (left column) and SVD (right
column) across different LSTM architectures. From top to bottom: predictions for LSTM
with 1 Dense, 2 Dense, and Time-Distributed architectures.
The temporal evolution plots in Figures 13 and 14 present the comparison between
the ground truth and the predicted streamwise and normal velocity components, respect-
ively. The predicted temporal patterns for the streamwise velocity of both HOSVD and
SVD closely follow the ground truth, demonstrating the ability of the models to capture
the periodicity of the streamwise velocity component. Minor deviations are observed in
the peaks and troughs of the predictions, with SVD in the vicinity of the peaks. Both
the predicted streamwise and the predicted normal velocity patterns align well with the
