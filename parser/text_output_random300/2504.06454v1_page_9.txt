applications, such as high-ﬁeld superconducting magnets[59]. Most thin-ﬁlm samples
surpass this benchmark up to 4 T (at 2 K) and 2 T (at 4.2 K). While the self-ﬁeld Jc
of thin-ﬁlm superconductors typically exceeds that of bulk samples, the precise origin
of the enhanced Jc in thin ﬁlms remains unclear.
