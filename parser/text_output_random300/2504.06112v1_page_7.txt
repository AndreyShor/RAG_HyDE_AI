FIG. 1: The adaptive control mechanism of an individual’s fitness in the presence of an
advantageous environment. The arrows represent the adaptive control process, with the
labels indicating the relationship between pi and ¯pi required for each control step. When
µ = 0, all individuals play traditional SDG and PDG, without considering the influence of
the advantageous environment. When µ ̸= 0 and pi < ¯pi, the advantageous environment is
introduced into the multi-game model. Furthermore, when µ = 1 and pi < ¯pi, the player’s
fitness is entirely determined by the advantageous environment.
2. Social environment assessment. In both natural and social systems, the external fac-
tors, i.e. the environment, influences individual payoffs and decision-making. Follow-
ing previous studies [37, 38], the social environment is defined as:
¯pi =
Pki
j∈Ω(i) pj
ki
,
(6)
where ki = 4 represents the degree of player i. A favorable environment has a positive
impact on nature and society, enhancing individual survival, whereas an unfavorable
environment has the opposite effect [46]. If pi < ¯pi, then ¯pi is termed an advantageous
environment; otherwise, it is a disadvantageous environment. Note that to obtain pj
at this step, we also make each player j in turn to play with their respective neighbors.
