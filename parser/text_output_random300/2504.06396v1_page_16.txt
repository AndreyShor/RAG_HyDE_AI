10,000-bus case. Additionally, the diameter 𝑑of the network, which also correlates with this metric,
further illustrates the disparities in topology performance. The diameter for the statistics-based
topology spans 40, 88, and 36 hops for the respective bus cases, compared to only 6 to 8 hops in both
the star and radial topologies. This extended path length in the statistics-based topology is a notable
drawback, potentially resulting in increased latency. As described in [27], the power grid is highly
interconnected and disturbances in one region can spread to other regions. This means the utility
control center or a balancing authority needs to receive timely voltage and current measurements
over the wide area network. A read command sent from a UCC to a substation might experience
delays due to the need to traverse more nodes, i.e., more routers, which could significantly impact
the timely delivery of packets. Also, these routers may experience congestion delays. For this
reason and the latency it may cause, the statistics-based topology’s higher path length and network
diameter are considered drawbacks of this topology, but they show more realism.
On the other hand, the maximum node degree in the statistics-based topology is significantly
lower, with a peak of 8, in contrast to 68 and 57 in the star and radial topologies, respectively, for
the 500-bus case. This indicates fewer critical nodes within the statistics-based topology and a
lack of nodes burdened by excessive connections. As a result, the failure of a single node in the
statistics-based topology would likely have a less severe impact on the communication network
than a failure in either the star or radial topologies.
Node degree calculations provide insights into the connectivity of every node within the graph.
Fig. 8, Fig. 9, and Fig. 10 illustrate a more balanced node degree distribution within the statistics-
based topology, characterized by several nodes having multiple connections. Yet, none are exces-
sively linked. In contrast, the star topology has multiple connections converge on a single node.
Such bottlenecks can lead to network overload, heightened latency, and critical failure points. The
radial topology offers a slight improvement over the star topology in node degree distribution,
because not all substations are directly connected to the control center. However, the radial topology
still presents nodes with high degrees, such as the utility control centers.
