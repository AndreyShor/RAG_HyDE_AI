the preimage under fT1 of a Brownian motion started at 0 which exits D through the clockwise
arc from XT1 to 1 must first exit D \ (η([0, T1]) ∪S) through S ∪A. Note that ω tends to θ0 −δ0
as δ1 tends to 0. Hence we can choose δ1 sufficiently small so that ω ∈(0, θ0), which guarantees
that XT1 is on the clockwise arc from a0 to 1. This ensures that T0 < T1 a.s. on E0. Therefore
P(T0 < T1) ≥p0.
Let (Ft)t≥0 be the filtration adapted to η. For all r ∈(0, r0/8], we have
P[W4(a, ε, r)] ≥P[W4(a, ε, r)1T0<T1] = E
P[W4(a, ε, r) | FT0] 1T0<T1
.
(6.12)
Note that fT0(η([T0, T])) is distributed as a SLEκ in D from a0 to 1. On the event T0 < T1, we
have 1 ≤f′
T0(0) ≤2 by the Schwarz lemma. Therefore, by the Koebe 1/4 theorem, we have
fT0(Br0/8) ⊆Br0,
fT0(Bε) ⊇Bε/4.
Therefore
P[W4(a, ε, r0/8) | FT0] ≥P[W4(a0, ε/4, r0)]
(6.13)
By Assumption 1, there exists ε ∈(0, ε0) such that P[W4(a0, ε/4, r0)] ≥(C/p0)εξ4. Injecting this
back into (6.12) and (6.13), we get
P[W4(a, ε, r0/8)] ≥(C/p0)εξ4P[T0 < T1] ≥Cεξ4.
Since P[W4(a, ε, r)] is increasing as r decreases, we have completed the proof.
Proof of (1.8) in Theorem 1.3. We explore Γ according to Exploration process 2, and use the no-
tations therein. We fix r = 1/2 for the quantity r in Exploration process 2. On the event E1, by
the Schwarz lemma, we have 1 ≤f′(0) ≤2/r = 4. By the Koebe 1/4 theorem, for s ∈(0, 1/32),
we have
Bε/4 ⊆f(Bε),
f(Bs) ⊆B16s.
(6.14)
Let E2 be the event that eγ (seen as a curve from f(a) to f(b)) first intersects Bε/4, then intersects
∂B16s, then intersects Bε/4 again. If both E1 and E2 hold, then E1(ε, s) occurs. Therefore
P
E1(ε, s)
 ≥P[E1 ∩E2] = E[P[E2 | Σ]1E1].
(6.15)
On E1, conditionally on Σ, eγ is a chordal SLEκ in H between f(a) and f(b). We now try to induce
a contradiction under Assumption 1. By Lemma 6.4, for s ∈(0, r0/128), for all C > 0 and ε0 > 0,
there exists ε ∈(0, ε0), such that P[E2 | Σ] ≥Cεξ4. Injecting it back into (6.15) leads to
P
E1(ε, s)
 ≥CP[E1]εξ4.
(6.16)
On the other hand, by (1.4), there exists c0 > 0 (which depends on s, ε0, but not on C or ε) such
that P
E1(ε, s)
 ≤c0εξ4. Combining it with (6.16) yields
c0εξ4 ≥CP[E1]εξ4.
This leads to a contradiction since P[E1] > 0 and we can choose C as big as we want. This completes
the proof of (1.8).
