are the retarded, advanced, and Keldysh components of the normal and anomalous quasiclas-
sical Green’s functions of the superconducting leads [61], and ħhνα/∆α is the Dynes parameter
of the superconducting lead α. As we will see in the next subsection, the polarization opera-
tors ΠR
n(ω) and ΠR
s (ω) correspond to current-phase response functions for normal current and
supercurrent, respectively.
In Fig. 1 we show the frequency dependence of the retarded polarization operators ΠR
n(ω)
and ΠR
s (ω) for a symmetric junction ∆l = ∆r in the cases of low temperature kBTs ≪∆Σ = ∆l+∆r
and relatively high temperature kBTs ≲∆Σ of the leads. The real and imaginary parts of the
polarization operators are responsible for reactive and dissipative response, respectively. Due
to retarded causality, they obey Kramers–Kronig relations [68]. We observe sharp logarithmic
singularities of the polarization operator at frequencies ω = ±∆Σ/ħh and emergence of strong
dissipation at higher frequencies. This happens because the energy of a photon at such a high
frequency is sufficient to break a Cooper pair and create two quasiparticles, one at each of the
leads. In the case of a hot junction with a non-vanishing density of thermal quasiparticles, we
also observe a weak ωlnω-type singularity at zero frequency. Such a singularity corresponds
to the tunneling of thermal quasiparticles [69, 70]. In the case of an asymmetric junction
∆l ̸= ∆r the corresponding singularity splits into two logarithmic singularities at frequencies
