one ion at a time to avoid driving any actual entangling

An example set of data for this calibration is

C.
Residual Light Shift Cancellation
While calibrating ζbr eliminates the strongest contribu-
tions of the fourth-order light shift, there is still a residual
light shift. As shown in Fig. 5, this residual light shift is
6°, but we typically find it varies across different MS gate
pairs in a larger chain, and can be anywhere from 3−30°
for maximally entangling gates. To correct for this resid-
ual light shift we take advantage of a “frame rotation,”
a phase-bookkeeping approach which advances the phase
on all subsequent pulses on any given qubit.
We describe the nuances of how this frame rotation
is implemented in our control hardware, Octet, in detail
in [12], but relevant features are discussed here. In par-
ticular, across a circuit, these frame rotations are tracked

FIG. 6: Microwave echo calibration of ζbr for selecting
point of best coherence. A two-qubit pulse sequence
example is shown on the top where we start by applying
a microwave Rµ
y( π
2 ) pulse to each ion. We test the echo
sequence against the Ramsey sequence by applying the
equivalent single-qubit MS(π/2) gates as in the
Ramsey sequence on each of the ions in the chain,
separated in time such that the light drives only one ion
at a time. These are separated by an echoing microwave
π pulse, reversing the phase evolution of the spins.
Then another set of single-qubit MS gates are applied.
Finally, a final projection pulse is applied via another
microwave Rµ
y( π
2 ) gate. In the bottom, plotted are the
results of the echo calibration of ζbr taken on four
qubits, with each qubit’s trace fit to a Gaussian. For
each qubit [q−1,q0,q1,q2], the best ζbr is found to be
[1.10, 1.10, 1.12, 1.15]. The inset shows the a Ramsey
sequence and the equivalent echo sequence on one
qubit, with both showing similar decay profiles.
within the control hardware for each qubit. To be clear,
we refer to the overall tracked phase per qubit (i) per
circuit as the “qubit frame,” Φi and the individual opera-
tions that modify that frame as “frame rotations,” ϕf,i(t).
We note that ϕf,i(t) can be programmed to occur dur-
ing a gate or as a standalone operation, i.e. a virtual Z
(or phase) gate. In the context of the Raman transitions
that underly our gates, phases are defined as the relation
between certain legs of the specific Raman transitions,
and thus care must be taken to ensure the qubit frame
is referenced properly. For instance, in the MS gate, we
reference the qubit frame Φi on both tones of the IA
beam.
Harnessing this the control hardware capability, we de-
scribe an implementation that cancels the residual light
shift. We use ϕf,i(t) as a dynamic phase shift concur-
