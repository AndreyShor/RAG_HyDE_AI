Substitution of (3.1) into the dimensionless problem (2.12) yields a system of linear equations;
we shall retain terms up to and including O(𝜖) since they are required to explain the symmetry
breaking phenomenon that was observed numerically (see fig. 3).
3.1. Expanded solution
Substitution of the formal expansion (3.1) into the governing equations (2.12), yields the

We identify the usual lubrication/boundary layer theory result that the leading order pressure
is constant along a cross section (Craster & Matar 2006). Furthermore, we note that the
differential operators acting on the continuity and momentum equations are the same as in
cylindrical coordinates (Batchelor 1973).
Our starting point is the continuity equation, which can be integrated over a cross-section
to deduce that the flux 𝑄=
∫2𝜋
0
∫𝑎(𝑠)
0
𝑟𝑤(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) d𝑟d𝜃is conserved in the 𝑠direction,
i.e. 𝜕𝑄/𝜕𝑠= 0. This means that the flux is exclusively a function of time, a fact we will
exploit to derive a reduced-order equation. Invoking symmetry we now seek an axisymmetric
solution with 𝑣0 = 0 and leading order terms independent of 𝜃.
Turning our attention to the O(𝜖) problem, we note that 𝑝1(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) may be decomposed
into a pressure gradient along the duct axis and an 𝑠-independent pressure variation due to
centrifugal effects, so that
𝑝1(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) = ¯𝑝1(𝑠, 𝑡) +
¤Ω0T 2𝐹(𝑡)2
𝜅
𝑟cos 𝜃,
(3.4)
and as we only require the 𝑠component of the pressure gradient in the computation of the
axial velocity, we may safely ignore the 𝑠-independent component of 𝑝1 and use ¯𝑝1(𝑠, 𝑡) in its
place. Moreover, the first order pressure jump across the cupula Δ𝑝1 = 𝑝1(𝑠= 2𝜋, 𝑡)−𝑝1(𝑠=
0, 𝑡) = Δ ¯𝑝1.
The solutions giving the first two orders of the axial velocity in terms of the pressure
gradients may be determined directly: 𝑤0 is found from (3.2a), under the assumption of
axisymmetry, while 𝑤1 may be found by decomposing it into axisymmetric and asymmetric
