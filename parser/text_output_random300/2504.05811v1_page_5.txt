Most parts of the formalism, including the Lagrangians, propagators, form factors attached to
hadronic vertices, the gauge-invariance preserving term, and the interaction coupling constants, are
detailed in Refs. [40, 41]. For brevity, we do not repeat them here but present only the additional
content relevant to the theoretical model in this work.
First, this work focuses on the γp →K+Σ0 and γp →K0Σ+ reactions, so the coupling constant
gγK0K∗0 = −0.631 referred to Ref. [57], and different isospin factors will be used in the specific
calculations. Second, the Lagrangians [45] and the propagator used for K1(1270) are presented
below:

Finally, we briefly explain the treatment of the molecules in the s-channel. Take N(2080)3/2−as
an example, which is assumed to be a pure S-wave molecular state of K∗and Σ. In principle, in the
hadronic molecular picture, both the electromagnetic and hadronic couplings of it are dedicated by
the loop diagrams illustrated in Fig. 2 [15]. Here for simplicity, we just follow Ref. [16] to calculate
