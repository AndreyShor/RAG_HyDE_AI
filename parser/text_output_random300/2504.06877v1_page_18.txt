Since we are interested in the average field, we ignore the noise contribution here. Transmis-
sion coefficient S21(ω) provides relation between the input field vp(ω) and output field
vo(ω) = −iωφp(ω) = S21(ω)vp(ω).

This coefficient can be easily obtained by solving system (50). In the second order with respect
to the coupling capacitance Cp, it is given by Eq. (29)

Heat flow
To calculate the heat flow to the probe line, we take account of the noise current coming from
the driven junction together with the thermal noise from the drive line. We start with equation
of motion in time domain:

Here, ˜Ip(t) is the thermal current noise from the transmission line, characterized by the cor-

To get expression for the heat flow power, we multiply the first equation by ˙φr, the second
equation by ˙φp, add them up, and collect the terms which can be expressed as a full time
