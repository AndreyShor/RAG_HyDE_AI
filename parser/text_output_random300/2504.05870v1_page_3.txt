in the two constant approximation K3 = K1. In addition we assume constant disclination line
tension γ (see [23]).
In [23], the equilibrium shape of disclination lines in the above model is calculated using the
following steps:
1. For a given disclination line shape Γ, the equilibrium state of the director field in the bulk is
calculated.
2. The force f(Γ) acting on the line is calculated using analogy with magnetostatics.
3. Equilibrium shapes, for which f(Γ) = 0, are found.
It is shown that disclination lines connect surface defects according to connectivity rules of two-
dimensional nematics. These lines traverse laterally along the mid-plane between the two bound-
aries, except near their ends. This renders the entire problem two-dimensional (Fig. 1). The in-plane
force acting on a lateral line segment is
f = γκ + 2πqK

where the system parameters are h the cell thickness, γ the line tension, and K ≡√K1K2 the
elastic constant. The geometric measurables are ˆT and κ, the Frenet-Serret tangent and curvature
vector of the disclination curve, respectively, and q the disclination charge. Note that ˆT and q
are defined ambiguously by an arbitrary choice of direction, however the product q ˆT and therefore
eq. (2) remain invariant. ∆θ ∼= θt −θb ± qπ (mod π) is the total rotation of the director between
the top and bottom plates. Unlike [23], it is averaged over the two sides of the disclination line
to remove ambiguity in the definition. We simplify Eq. (2) by defining ˆT ⊥≡ˆz × ˆT and setting
f
∆θ = 2πq∆θ, κ = κ · ˆT ⊥and λ =

K h. As seen in [23], λ is the line-tension-induced smoothing
scale of the disclination curve. We now obtain the simple form
f = f K

Equilibrium disclination paths
In experimental systems such as [18, 21, 23] the patterning on the top and bottom plates is fixed.
Eq. (4a) is then a local second-order system of ordinary differential equations (SODE or spray) [26]
for disclination paths:
¨Γ = (¨x, ¨y) = −
f
∆θ
λ (−˙y, ˙x)

where Γ(s) = (x(s), y(s)) is the arclength-parametrized disclination path. Eq. (5) uniquely deter-
mines an equilibrium path (a geodesic of the spray) given an initial condition, namely its position
and direction at a point.
