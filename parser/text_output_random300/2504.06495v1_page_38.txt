(B) At time τ = 0, a quantum measurement occurs, causing a discrete branching event:
X0 = log(∆) + Xpast
0
,
where ∆= δB, and B is a discrete random variable uniformly distributed over {1, . . . , K},
indexing the K possible measurement outcomes. Each outcome k is associated with
a branching ratio δk ∈(0, 1), with PK
k=1 δk = 1.
In terms of the original process
Φτ = ατ exp(Xτ), this branching step corresponds to Φ0 = ∆· Φpast
0
.
(C) After the measurement, the process Xτ continues to evolve forward in time for τ > 0
according to (18), using the same parameters µ and σ (so that µ/σ2 = 1). We assume
that the pre-measurement process (Xpast
τ
: τ < 0), the measurement outcome B, and
the post-measurement process (Xτ : τ > 0) are all mutually independent.
Under this setup, we now examine the distribution of measurement outcomes conditional on
survival until time τ, as τ →∞.
Corollary 1 Let the setup be as described in (A), (B), and (C), with ﬁxed branching weights
δk ∈(0, 1). Then:
lim
τ→∞P(B = k | Xτ ̸= −∞) = δk.
Given our earlier discussion and results, this corollary should be unsurprising.
However,
there is a subtle shift in perspective: In Theorem 3 we computed the large τ limit of the
survival probability P(Xτ ̸= −∞| X0 = x0), which, in the context of the measurement setup
here, corresponds to P(Xτ ̸= −∞| B = k), since each outcome k determines the initial value
X0 = log(δk) + Xpast
0
. Here, by contrast, we are interested in the probability of a particular
measurement outcome B = k conditional on survival. To relate these two perspectives, we
apply Bayes’ rule:
P(B = k | Xτ ̸= −∞) =
P(Xτ ̸= −∞| B = k) · P(B = k)
PK
j=1 P(Xτ ̸= −∞| B = j) · P(B = j)
.
