the 3D cylinder and for both the components in the experimental and 2D cylinder cases
for the SVD-based models. SVD-based models decompose the original dataset, but they
do not explicitly model temporal dependencies like HOSVD. The time-distributed model
helps reconstruct more effectively by applying transformations uniformly to each output
across each time step, thereby improving forecasting accuracy. Comparisons were also
drawn with another architecture developed with an additional dense layer (Appendix A1)
without substantial improvements. This suggests that increasing the depth of the network
beyond certain layers does not provide any significant advantage in terms of accuracy and
performance. Adding additional layers should be avoided to minimize computational costs
unless they provide a significant performance improvement.

Conclusion
The developed models have demonstrated how integrating HOSVD with LSTM archi-
tectures enables the development of efficient and reliable hybrid ROMs for fluid flow
prediction. By combining advanced dimensionality reduction techniques with sequential
deep learning, this work addresses the challenges of capturing complex spatio-temporal
dynamics across a range of laminar and turbulent flow cases, including 2D cylinder, 3D
cylinder, and experimental wake flows.
The results presented above highlight the superiority of HOSVD over SVD in both pre-
dictive accuracy and robustness. HOSVD effectively preserves the multidimensional struc-
ture of the data, allowing for more accurate reconstruction of key flow features while min-
imizing errors. This is particularly evident in turbulent data sets, where SVD struggled
to model chaotic and nonlinear dynamics, as shown by broader error distributions and
higher RRMSE values. Across all data sets, HOSVD consistently achieved narrower UQ
distributions, indicating greater reliability and confidence in the predictions. In the cur-
rent implementation of HOSVD, all spatial modes are retained, and only the temporal
dimension is reduced. While this preserves the full spatial variability, it limits the de-
noising and compression advantages that HOSVD offers. In future work, mode selection
across all tensor dimensions will be explored, taking advantage of HOSVD’s ability to
retain different numbers of modes per direction.
The study also investigated the interplay between network depth, complexity, and
predictive performance, focusing on determining the optimal complexity required for ef-
fective optimization. Simpler LSTM architectures with a single dense layer demonstrated
sufficient capability to model the flows, effectively capturing periodic patterns while main-
taining computational efficiency. Although these simple architectures produced reasonable
predictions, incorporating an additional dense layer improved the network’s ability to rep-
resent the inherent non-linearities and chaotic dynamics of such data sets. The additional
dense layer expands the network’s representational capacity, enabling it to better capture
intricate flow patterns. These findings emphasize the necessity of tailoring the network
