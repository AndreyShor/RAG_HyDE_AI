The interpretation of the numerical results is of interest. Again, as observed for the previous case, both
the minimal and the minimal eigenvalues converge monotonically to the minimum and to maximum of the
symbol, respectively, in line with results which are usually observed for matrix-valued LPOs.

Conclusions
In our study we have used the theory of GLT ∗-algebras for dealing with structured matrix-sequences,
stemming from the modelling of mean-field quantum spin systems. More precisely, we have expressed the
related matrix-sequences in the GLT formalism. Two cases have been considered in detail. In both cases,
we have found the spectral distributions in the context of the GLT theory and the theoretical results have
been confirmed via visualizations and numerical tests. Many open problems remain. Among them we can
cite the study of the extremal eigenvalues and the expansion of the considered matrix-sequences via GLT
momentary GLT symbols [9, 2], in order to have a finer description of the spectrum with respect to Theorem
3. For instance, in the nonreduced case, the GLT symbol equal to zero in Theorem 2 could hyde a finer
structure in the sense that it could be imagined that there exists a numerical sequence αN converging to zero
such that the considered matrix-sequence divided by αN is still a GLT sequence with nonzero GLT symbol.
In that setting, it is possible that the emerging GLT structure could be multilevel (given the geometry on
the sphere as in (3.5)), block (given the presence of the basic blocks in (3.2)) [5, 6, 14, 15] or even of reduced
