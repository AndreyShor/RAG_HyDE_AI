Gell-Mann and Low formula since broken translational invariance invalidates Haag’s theorem
[17]. Standard QFT suffers from Haag’s theorem [17], which prohibits a non-trivial interaction
picture or perturbation theory – a no-go result often overlooked in contemporary literature.
Let us formulate this precisely. We denote the vacuum states in interactive and non-interactive
Fock spaces as |Ω⟩and |0⟩, respectively, and represent interactive and non-interactive fields as
ϕ and ϕ0. The evolution operator relating free and interacting theory for t > t′ is:
U(t, t′) = exp

−i
Z t
t′ HI(τ)dτ

(37)
Standard QFT assumes the existence of the unitary operator connecting the free and interactive
fields through:
ϕ(t,⃗x) = U †(t, t0)ϕ0(t,⃗x)U(t, t0) .
(38)
Moreover, the free and interactive vacuua are related as (calling t′ = 0 and t = T, as T →∞)
[27],
|Ω⟩=
U(0, ±T)|0⟩
⟨0|U(0, ±T)|0⟩.
(39)
Plugging (39) into ⟨Ω|T ϕ(x)ϕ(y)|Ω⟩and performing simple algebra yields the Gell-Mann and
Low relation:
⟨Ω|T ϕ(x)ϕ(y)|Ω⟩=
⟨0|T ϕ0(x)ϕ0(y) exp[−i
R ∞
−∞HI(t)dt]|0⟩
⟨0|T exp[−i
R ∞
−∞HI(t)dt]|0⟩
(40)
Unfortunately, Haag’s theorem establishes that equations (38) and (39) are valid only in the
free-field case, namely, when U is the identity – meaning that the interaction picture exists only
when no interaction exists 5.
For the present discussion, the crucial point is that fractal QFT circumvents this issue
through its non-translational invariant vacuum. The proof of Haag’s theorem depends on vac-
uum translational invariance (see appendix A), a condition explicitly violated in fractal QFT as
shown in equation (33). This violation enables fractal QFT to construct a consistent operator U
in (38) and (39), while the logical steps to arrive at (40) remain unchanged. As a result, fractal
QFT guarantees a robust perturbative framework, remarkably improving the standard theory –
see also section 5.

Possible Implications and Discussion
In this section, we explore some implications of fractal QFT. The most striking consequence
is perturbative finiteness – all loops become convergent. Moreover, we argue that perturba-
tive series behave better at large order n due to the absence of UV renormalons. Recall that
