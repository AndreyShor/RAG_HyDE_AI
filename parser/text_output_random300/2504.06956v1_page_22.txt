Lemma 4.9 (Approximation by a Brownian motion). There exists a constant C > 0 such that for all
b ∈N ∩{∞} and all j ∈[b −1], on the event {Kb < b},
 sup
x∈Aj
Υb,g(x) + Bj
 ≤RKb(j) ,
(4.12)
where Rk(j)
def= C(1 + Θk(j)).
Proof. Let b ∈N, j ∈[b −1], and x ∈Aj. Now, recalling (4.5), we can write
Υb,g(x) = −Bj −
Z b
j
(1 −K(e−sx))dBs + Zj(x) + Zj,b(x) −
√
2dab(x) + gb(x) ,
where we used the fact that thanks to (K2), the function K is supported in B(0, 1). In particular, using
the triangle inequality, this implies that
 sup
x∈Aj
Υb,g(x) + Bj
 ≤sup
x∈Aj

Now, on the event {Kb < b}, by Definition 4.6 of the control variable Kb and by Lemma 4.5, there
exists a constant C > 0 such that the last four terms on the right-hand side of the above display are
bounded from above by a quantity of the form C(1 + ΘKb(j)). Therefore, it remains to check that a
similar bound also holds for the first term. Again, by Definition 4.6 of Kb, this follows by a simple
computation. Indeed, we have that
sup
x∈Aj

Z b
j
(1 −K(e−sx))dBs
 ≲ej+1
b−1
X
m=j
e−m Oscm(B) ≤ej+1
b−1
X
m=j
e−mΘKb(m) ,
where the implicit constant is independent of everything else. The quantity on the right-hand side of
the above display can be clearly bounded by a quantity of the form C(1 + ΘKb(j)), for some constant
C > 0. Hence, the estimate in (4.12) follows. Finally, we note that if b = ∞, then the proof is
completely analogous.
We record here some useful inclusions that are immediate consequences of Lemma 4.9 and will be
used several times in the remainder of this section. In particular, recalling the notation introduced
in (3.3) and (3.4), and using the same notation as in the previous lemma, for each λ > 0, thanks to
(4.12), one can see that for all b ∈N and k ∈[b −1], the following inclusions hold
{Kb < b} ∩{M0,b(Υb,g) ≤λ} ⊆
b−1
\
j=1
{Bj ≥−λ −RKb(j)} ,
(4.13)
{Kb < b} ∩
b−1
\
j=k
{Bj ≥λ + RKb(j)} ⊆{M0,b,k(Υb,g) ≤λ} .
(4.14)
Similar inclusions hold also for the field Υ∞. Indeed, thanks to (4.12), for all b ∈N and k ∈[b −1],
we have that
{K∞< ∞} ∩{M0,b(Υ∞) ≤λ} ⊆
b−1
\
j=1
{Bj ≥−λ −eReKb(j)} ,
(4.15)
{K∞< ∞} ∩
b−1
\
j=k
{Bj ≥λ + eReKb(j)} ⊆{M0,b,kΥ∞) ≤λ} .
