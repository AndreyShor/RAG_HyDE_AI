Supplementary Figure 9: Left panel: variations of the metallicity proﬁle for one of the seismic
models in the opacity reconstruction, both models ﬁt the solar luminosity value. Right panel:
opacity proﬁles in the upper radiative layers obtained for both metallicity proﬁles of the left
panel. The curves are undistinguishable
