Fig. 4 MSE training and validation loss curves over 1000 epochs. The original simulated CBFi (label) was scaled by 
106 to prevent slow training convergence, the training and validation losses converged to ~84.35 (in the scaled 
units). The total training time for 1000 epochs was 9.4 hours. 
2.5 Monte Carlo simulation for test dataset generation 
We conducted MC simulations using the voxel-based Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX)47 toolkit in 
MATLAB (R2023b, The MathWorks) to generate the test dataset. We simulated a slab human 
head model with a volume of 200×200×100 mm3, segmented into four layers, each layer 
representing scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain tissues. 785 nm light was used in all 
MC simulations, the layer thicknesses and optical parameters at 785 nm are listed in Table 3. Each 
simulation was executed with 5×108 photons and the detector was positioned at 𝜌𝜌 = 35 mm to 
record the photon transfer and photon pathlength, thereby enabling the calculation of the temporal 
light field ACF7,48:

where 𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝 is the number of detected photons at each detector, 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 is the number of tissue types 
(𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 = 4 in our case), 𝑌𝑌𝑛𝑛,𝑖𝑖 and 𝐿𝐿𝑛𝑛,𝑖𝑖 are the total momentum transfer and total pathlength of 
photon 𝑛𝑛 in Layer 𝑖𝑖, and 𝜇𝜇𝑎𝑎,𝑖𝑖 is the absorption coefficient in Layer 𝑖𝑖. 〈∆𝑟𝑟2(𝜏𝜏)〉𝑖𝑖= 6𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝜏𝜏 is the 
mean square displacement of the scattered particles in Layer 𝑖𝑖, where 𝐷𝐷𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 is the effective Brownian 
diffusion coefficient in Layer 𝑖𝑖. The correlation delay time 𝜏𝜏 was set between 1.28 µs and 39.68 
µs with 31 linearly spaced data points to agree with the SPAD output data format. 𝛽𝛽 was set to 0.5, 
𝑔𝑔2(𝜏𝜏) curves were obtained by substituting the normalized electric field ACF into Eq. (5). The 
anisotropic factor 𝑔𝑔 was set to 0.89 for all MC simulations.
