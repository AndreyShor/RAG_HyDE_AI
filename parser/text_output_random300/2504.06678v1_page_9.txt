Supplemental Materials: Geometric Quantum Gates of Non-closed Paths Under
Counterdiabatic Driving
In a non-adiabatic quantum system with rapidly changing parameters, we introduce the counterdiabatic (CD)
protocols, and the counterdiabatic gauge potential operator Aλ where λ = λ(t) is a time-dependent coefficient, and
the Hamiltonian of the non-adiabatic system is written as
He = H(λ) + ˙λAλ
(S1)
where the second term on the right of the equal sign reflects the non-adiabatic variation of the parameter, regarded
as the non-adiabatic term. Consider the following equation
i∂t |ψ⟩=
h
H(λ) + ˙λAλ
i
|ψ⟩
(S2)
Under the anti-adiabatic conditions, there is
[H(λ), Aλ] = i∂λH(λ)
(S3)
The system evolving from state |n⟩to |m⟩satisfies:
⟨m| [H(λ), Aλ] |n⟩= (En −Em) ⟨m|Aλ|n⟩
(S4)
We obtain that:
⟨m| Aλ |n⟩= −i⟨m| ∂λH(λ) |n⟩
(Em −En)
(S5)
Thus there must be
Aλ = −i
X
m̸=n
|m⟩⟨m| ∂λH(λ) |n⟩⟨n|
(Em −En)
(S6)
Such a matrix is non-diagonal. Returning to consider equation (2), the state function must be written as
|ψ⟩= e−iϕ |n⟩
(S7)
i ⟨m|∂λn⟩= ⟨m| Aλ |n⟩
(S8)
This indicates that the non-adiabatic correction is jointly determined by the above two items together. Adjusting λ
and Aλ can make the non-adiabatic behavior return to the adiabatic framework, avoid excessively rapid decoherence,
and maintain the robustness of the quantum system state. It will be discussed in detail later.

NON-ADIABATIC CORRECTION
Introduce path integrals to continue time evolution aiming to allow the original adiabatic phase and AGP corrections
to separate the variables, which is a crucial step.
