Figure S6. Determination of the screening TR profile. (a) The contour plot of steady 
RC spectrum as a function of doping in MoSe2, around the resonances of MoSe2 and 
WS2. 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸 is fixed at 0 V. The dashed box denotes the electron-doping regime of MoSe2. 
(b) The linecuts of the RC spectra around AW resonance at varying 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒, indicated by 
the dashed box in (a). (c) The contrast between the RC spectra of AW resonance with 
electron doped MoSe2 ( RC𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒) and that with neutral MoSe2 ( RC0 ), defined as

shows normalized TR profiles with varying electron doping in MoSe2. (d) The 
maximums of the screening TR profiles as a function of 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 in MoSe2.  
6.4 Discussion of the three effects and the two-profile analysis 
Let’s first compare the electron-transfer TR profile with 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒=3.5×1010 cm-2 in WS2, 
the temperature-increase TR profile with ∆𝑇𝑇=21 K, and the screening TR profile with 
𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒=0.47 ×1012 cm-2 in MoSe2, shown Figure S7a-c, respectively. Their normalized 
profiles are shown in Figure S7d. We can see that, the electron-transfer TR profile is 
distinctly different from the other two almost identical TR profiles.  
Although the temperature-increase and screening TR profiles cannot be spectrally 
distinguished, we expect that, the temperature-increase should lead to a larger 
contribution to the experimental TR signal than that of the screening effect. The reason 
is that, the screening-TR profile calibrated in the steady measurement exaggerates the 
screening ability of photo-excited carriers. In the steady measurement, the screening 
effect on excitons of WS2 origins from the doped electrons in MoSe2, which obeys the 
1/ r2 Coulomb potential between electron and exciton, where r denotes the electron-
exciton separation. While in the pump-probe measurement, the screening effect comes 
from the photo-excited excitons, which obeys the 1/r3 Coulomb potential of dipole-
dipole interaction and exhibits a faster decay with r than the steady case. Moreover, 
owing to the inserted 3L-hBN between MoSe2 and WS2 which enlarges the distance 
and weakens the dipole-dipole interaction, the screening effect is excluded in the 
analysis. 
We use the electron-transfer TR profile of 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒=3.5×1010 cm-2 and the temperature-
increase TR profile of ∆𝑇𝑇=21 K as the two bases to fit the experimental TR spectra,
