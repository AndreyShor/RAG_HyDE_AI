Indeed, we can think of elements β ∈C1(G,H1(K,U(1))) as maps from G × K to
U(1) that are homomorphisms in their second argument, i.e.
β(g,k1)β(g,k2) = β(g,k1k2).
(2.5)
The cocycle condition is that they are a crossed homomorphism in their ﬁrst
argument, i.e. β ∈Z1(G,H1(K,U(1))) if and only if
β(g1g2,k) = β(g1,k)β(g2,s(g1)−1ks(g1)).
(2.6)
Meanwhile a cocycle β is said to be coexact if there exists a homomorphism ψ ∶
K →U(1) such that β(g,k) = ψ(s(g)−1ks(g)k−1), and the equivalence classes
of cocycles modulo exact cocycles deﬁnes H1(G,H1(K,U(1))).
The map d2 ∶
H1(G,H1(K,U(1))) →H3(G,U(1)) is then given in terms of a map (also denoted
d2) from Z1(G,H1(K,U(1))) to Z3(G,U(1)) deﬁned as
d2β(g1,g2,g3) = β(g1,s(g1)s(g2)s(g3)s(g2g3)−1s(g1)−1).
(2.7)
Then d2[β] ∶= [d2β] ∈H3(G,U(1)), and it can be checked that this is well-deﬁned
as a homomorphism of cohomology groups. Note that this is essentially the cup
product of [β] with the extension class [¯c], d2[β] = [β] ∪[¯c], or at the level of
cocycles, d2β = β ∪¯c.
The spectral sequence tells us that the image of d2 are classes that do not pull
back to nontrivial classes in H3(Γ,U(1)). Indeed, given β ∈Z1(G,H1(K,U(1)))
such that d2β = α, then we can deﬁne j ∈C2(Γ,U(1)) by
j(γ1,γ2) = β(π(γ1),s(π(γ1))γ2s(π(γ2))−1s(π(γ1))−1),
(2.8)
and one can check explicitly that dj = π∗α.
In this case we can gauge the group Γ. The details of the gauging will depend
on the “quantum symmetry phases” [4] speciﬁed by β, so we denote the gauged
theory as [X/Γ]β. This theory is well-deﬁned, in the sense that Γ has no gauge
anomaly, and as argued in [5], applying decomposition [7,8], [X/Γ]β is equivalent
to a disjoint union of orbifolds of X by nonanomalous subgroups of G.
Intuitively, the contribution coming from β ∪¯c cancels out the G anomaly α.
The physical interpretation is that we have taken a theory X with an anomalous
G symmetry and coupled it to an SPT for the K symmetry, with β describing
the mixed anomaly between G and K. The resulting theory has an overall non-
anomalous symmetry given by Γ, which can be gauged.
Of course, we are well aware that group-like symmetries are not the end of the
story, and we might wonder how this picture generalizes to include non-invertible
symmetries. The simplest case is that we again begin with an anomalous group-like
symmetry, but extend it in such a way that the result is a non-invertible symmetry.
