given by 𝑓WDM. We show in the right plot of Figure 2 the
distinct suppression patterns of mixed CWDM models relative
to CDM. In particular, these hybrid models can remain light
as long as 𝑓WDM is small, resulting in a weaker suppression of
the matter power spectrum at slightly larger scales.
However, CWDM models with stronger suppression at
larger scales also show less suppression at small scales, com-
pared to pure WDM models. This is shown for a collection
of hand-picked models in the color gradient of Figure 2. For
such models we find that the Lyman-𝛼forest data in this work
constrain both the scale of the small-scale suppression, and the
shape of the transfer function around the suppression scale.

Flux power spectrum models
The synthetic Lyman-𝛼forest spectra, specifically the op-
tical depth field (𝜏), can be computed by extracting the infor-
mation on neutral hydrogen number density, temperature and
peculiar velocity contained in each pixel in the box along the
different lines-of-sight. These are parallel to the boundaries
of the box and have 𝑁bins = 2048 number of bins with width
𝛿𝑥= 𝐿box/𝑁bins. We extract 𝑁LOS = 5000 lines-of-sight and
compute the flux (𝐹= 𝑒−𝜏) field for each. The perturbations
in flux, 𝛿F = 𝐹/ ¯𝐹−1, are characterized by the 1D flux power
spectrum, 𝑃F(𝑘) = 𝐿−1
box⟨𝛿F𝛿∗
F⟩, where ¯𝐹is the mean transmit-
ted flux calculated as an average of the flux field across all the
pixels extracted from a simulation at each redshift. We repeat
this for the three redshift bins used in our analysis.
Without post-processing, the number of models that we
have established are spanned by the allowed WDM parame-
ters, 𝑚WDM = [1,2,3,4] keV and 𝑓WDM = [0.125,0.25,0.5,1.0].
These add up to 16 WDM cosmologies + 1 from CDM ( 𝑓WDM
= 0). As described above, for each cosmology, we run 12 sim-
ulations, each one with different thermal history, characterized
by the evolution of the cumulative injected heat into the IGM
at mean density (𝑢0(𝑧)). This amounts to 17×12 = 204 models
per redshift bin.
There are two steps involved in post-processing these sim-
ulations before inferring our cosmology from the flux power
spectra models. First, we exploit the temperature dependence
of the recombination coefficient 𝛼HII ∝T−0.72 in the Lyman-𝛼
forest regime to isolate the impact of the instantaneous temper-
ature of the gas on the power spectrum. We do this by rotating
and translating the 𝑇−𝜌plane of simulation parameters as has
been done in previous work (e.g. [69], [46]), recalculating the
𝜏field for a range of 𝑇0, 𝛾values. In this way, we obtain flux
models for a combination of 𝑇0 ∈[5000, 14000] K spaced by
1000 K, and 𝛾∈[0.9, 1.8] in steps of 0.1.
In the second step we assume photo-ionization equilibrium,
where 𝜏∝Γ−1
HI . A common approach for handling uncertain-
ties in ΓHI or more general the UV background is to adjust the
mean flux ¯𝐹derived from the simulated spectra to match the
observed measurements of effective optical depth 𝜏eff. This is
done by rescaling the 𝜏field, with ¯𝐹defined as ¯𝐹= 𝑒−𝜏eff. This
method is preferred over direct rescaling of ΓHI because the
mean transmitted Lyman-𝛼flux is measurable ([100–102]),
providing valuable prior knowledge of 𝜏eff to calibrate sim-
ulations and infer physically motivated posteriors on model
parameters.
After post-processing, the total number of models span a
grid of 15 × 10 × 10 × 204 models = 306000 parameter
values.
In Figure 3, we show the relative ratio of these simulated
flux power spectrum for WDM and CWDM cosmologies to
the reference CDM simulation at 𝑧= 4.2 and for a fixed thermal
history (𝑢0 = 8.14 eV,𝑇0 = 10700 K, 𝛾= 1.2) and the mean flux
( ¯𝐹) is fixed such that the effective optical depth matches that of
[69], i.e. 𝜏eff ≡−ln ¯𝐹= 𝜏effB. One can see that the suppression
in power at small scales (high 𝑘values) is enhanced for WDM
models with lower 𝑚WDM. This agrees with what one expects
for a lighter DM particle that has a larger free streaming length.
The magnitude of the suppression increases as the larger free
streaming strength suppresses structure at even larger scales.
This can also be seen in the behaviour of the power spectrum for
different 𝑓WDM values, namely, the smaller 𝑓WDM, the weaker
the effect on the power spectrum, eventually recovering CDM.
The 1𝜎uncertainties from [69] are also shown to illustrate the
sensitivity of the data to the WDM models. The sensitivity is
higher for "hotter" dark matter models, whereas the "colder"
dark matter models differ by less than the error margin, making
it difficult for the data to distinguish between them effectively.
C.
Mass resolution and box size correction
Prior to performing the inference, we test whether the mod-
els extracted from simulations are able to resolve the Lyman-𝛼
forest structure by running numerical convergence tests. The
two relevant parameters are 𝐿box and 𝑁p ([103–105]). The
first parameter sets the number of 𝑘-modes on large scales and
influences all scales due to non-linear coupling between the
modes. When 𝐿box is kept fixed, the smallest resolvable scale
is governed by the particle number, 𝑁p.
Following [46], we splice together the flux power from large
and small box size simulations, 𝐿box = 40 and 10 ℎ−1 Mpc,
varying 𝑁p = [10243, 5123] ([106]). We check that [69] is
sensitive only to the intermediate splicing regime. Therefore,
we correct the flux power spectra obtained with our reference
simulation 𝑃20,1024 by using the ratio of a simulation with bet-
ter resolution, 𝑃10,1024, and an equally limited resolution as
the reference, 𝑃10,512, 𝑅𝑠= 𝑃10,1024/𝑃10,512, where 𝑅𝑠is the
mass resolution correction. These models are shown in Table
I in [46].
Furthermore, the finite box size naturally introduces a trunca-
tion of the flux power spectrum at large scales but also affects
the small scales. This systematic is corrected with the box
size correction from the ratio 𝑃40,2048/𝑃20,1024. As shown in
[46], the correction at the low-𝑘modes is at the level of 3-5%.
We further check that the effect of mean flux rescaling in post-
processing on the box size correction is ≤0.5%. Therefore, we
correct our models at fixed mean flux corresponding to 𝜏effB.
