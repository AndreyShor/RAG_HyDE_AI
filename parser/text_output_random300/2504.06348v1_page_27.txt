Truncated thermal state.
The truncated thermal state over 3ηs
ion −6 (3ηs
ion −5 for linear molecules)
independent quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) states for each species s is,

where ls = (l1, ..., l3ηs
ion−6) label computational basis states of an ancilla and qs = (qs,1, ..., qs,3ηs
ion−6) as
before. A physically motivated cutoff is to choose the smallest l such that Prk(l) ≤ϵ for all l ≥lmax
s,k , for
some fixed ϵ, although other choices are possible.19 We obtain,

For each k, introduce ⌈log2 lmax
s,k ⌉= O(log log(1/ϵ)) ancillary qubits for the purification register. As desired,
performing the trace over the first register |l1, ..., l3ηs
ion−6⟩yields ρvib
s . We create this purification in the
following manner.
Preparation of QHO eigenstates.
With slight abuse of notation, we define ϕs,k
l
(qs,k) as a vector en-
coding ⟨qs,k|ϕs,k
l
⟩discretized using nvib qubits, where we keep the same number of discretization points for
all modes, although other choices are possible. On the k-th mode,
|ϕs,k

ϕs,k
l
(qs,k(b))|qs,k(b)⟩
(73)
where qs,k(1) and qs,k(2nvib) are determined by the relevant range in shape space, qs,k(b) linearly interpolates
between the two with Nvib = 2nvib discretization points, and N s,k,l
vib
is a normalization that depends on the
excitation number l and on the number of discretization points.
Let U s,k
l
be a unitary that prepares the state in Eq. (73) (the l = 0, . . . , lmax
s,k -th discretized QHO eigenstate
of mode k, species s) from the all zero state |0nvib⟩, given the vibrational mode frequencies,
U s,k
l
|0nvib⟩= |ϕs,k
l
⟩
(74)
The unitary U s,k
l
may be, for example, efficiently realized by quantum rejection sampling discussed in
Ref. [75] with the Type I reference states detailed in App. C, with complexity scaling with the logarithm of
the number discretization points, O(nvib).
19Note that since Prs,k(l) is temperature dependent, so too will be the choice of lmax
s,k , since higher temperatures mean higher
cutoffs to achieve the same ϵ. An alternative choice is to fix l so that we have a trace norm error ϵ to the exact thermal state.
