0.5. Increasing the period ratio to 20 or 50 shifts this threshold
to lower inclinations, shown by solid and dashed white lines. A
broad range of parameters can excite eccentricities above 0.5,
with low-mass companions (≈0.3 M⊙) sufficient at high incli-
nations (i ≳70◦) and moderate masses (mout ≳1 M⊙) requiring
inclinations of iout ≳50◦. The upper panel illustrates the ec-
centricity evolution for a specific configuration (mout = 0.5 M⊙,
iout = 60◦, Pout/Pin = 10), where eccentricities greater than 0.5
are achieved but only briefly. Requiring a probability of at least
20% for observing e > 0.5, estimated as the fraction of time
spent at such high eccentricities, imposes stricter constraints.
For Pout = 10 × Pin, inclinations >65◦are needed even at the
highest masses tested (black-hatched region in Fig. 16), while
for Pout = 50 × Pin, inclinations >80◦are required. Thus, if an
outer companion induced the eccentricity, we are likely to ob-
serve the system near an eccentricity peak or in a less probable
high-inclination configuration. The period of the eccentricity os-
cillations scales inversely with the mass of the outer companion
and quadratically with its period (Antognini 2015); ranging from
O(102 yr) – O(104 yr) for the configurations tested.
To test the triple scenario observationally, interferometric ob-
servations with the Center for High Angular Resolution Astron-
omy (CHARA) Array could search for a distant outer compan-
ion. Using the MIRC-X beam combiner in the H-band and the
longest baseline, CHARA can resolve companions with a mini-
mum separation of 0.5 mas (Gallenne et al. 2015), which corre-
sponds to about 0.87 AU at the distance of HIP 15429 (smaller
even than the inner binary’s semi-major axis a ≈0.94 AU). The
inner binary, with an H-band magnitude difference of 1.2 mag,
meets the resolution criteria of CHARA, and outer companions
with masses greater than ∼0.6 M⊙should also be detectable5.
However, the combined H-band magnitude of the system of
∼8.5 mag is at CHARA’s sensitivity limit (Anugu et al. 2020),
making it uncertain whether a sufficiently high signal-to-noise
ratio can be achieved.
10. Summary and conclusions
We conducted a detailed spectroscopic and evolutionary anal-
ysis of HIP 15429. The system was initially proposed as a B
star + dormant BH binary because of its high binary mass func-
tion and single-lined spectroscopic nature. Our results reveal that
HIP 15429 is more likely a post-interaction binary with two non-
degenerate components. Similar to recently discovered systems
like HR 6819, LB-1, and VFTS 291, HIP 15429 comprises a
bloated stripped star and a Be star companion recently detached
from a mass transfer episode.
Disentangling the obtained multi-epoch spectra revealed a
second luminous component, previously undetected because of
its shallow, rotationally broadened absorption lines and low to-
tal flux contribution. The only notable feature in the composite
spectra was a broad, almost stationary emission line in Hα, a
typical feature of Be star decretion disks.
Spectroscopic analysis of the disentangled spectra yielded
a temperature of Teff = 13.5 ± 0.5 kK and a surface gravity
of log g = 2.25 ± 0.25 for the stripped donor star. Due to the
degeneracy between rotational and macroturbulent broadening,
we could only set an upper limit on rotational velocity, with
vrot sin i ≤30 km/s.

evolution tracks and ATLAS9 Model Atmospheres (Castelli & Kurucz
2003) in combination with the Python packages pystellibs (Foues-
neau 2022) and pyphot (Fouesneau 2024)

binary HIP 15429 under the influence of a tertiary outer com-
panion with a mass of 0.5 M⊙, inclination of iout = 60◦, and
period ratio of 10 during the first 104 yr since the end of the
mass transfer phase. Lower panel: A heatmap visualizing the
maximum eccentricity excited in the inner binary as a function
of outer companion mass and inclination. The heatmap is com-
puted for a fixed outer to inner period ratio of 10. The white
dotted line marks the region of parameter space where the inner
binary’s maximum eccentricity exceeds 0.5. An increase of the
outer companion’s period shifts this line to slightly lower incli-
nations, shown for Pout/Pin = 20 and 50 with solid and dashed
white lines, respectively. The black hashed region indicates the
parameter space for which the probability of observing e > 0.5
for the inner binary at any given point exceeds 20%.
The companion star’s spectrum resembles that of classical
Be stars, specifically of spectral type ≈B3V, matching an in-
ferred temperature of Teff = 17+2
−1 kK for estimated surface grav-
ity of a main sequence star log g ≈4.0 ± 0.5. Assuming a fixed
macroturbulent velocity of 50 km/s, we estimated the projected
rotational velocity vrot sin i is 270 ± 70 km/s.
Fitting the spectral energy distribution yielded luminosities
and radii for both stars, allowing us to derive their spectroscopic
masses. For the stripped star, we found a mass of MB,spec =
0.69+0.63
−0.31 M⊙and a radius of 9.0+2.1
−1.7 R⊙. The mass of the Be star
was estimated at MBe,spec = 10.5+21.5
−7.1 M⊙, though this value is
highly uncertain because of the poorly constrained surface grav-
ity. Comparing the Be star’s luminosity and temperature to evo-
lutionary tracks suggests a mass of MBe,evol = 6.5±0.9 M⊙, while
estimates based on the binary mass function indicate a somewhat
higher mass of at least MBe,dyn ≥7.0 M⊙. We deem the dynamic
mass to be the more robust measurement and conclude that the
discrepancy between evolutionary and dynamical mass is likely
