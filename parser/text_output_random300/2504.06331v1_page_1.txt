ABSTRACT
In this work, we present a new, fully Bayesian analysis of the highest-resolution optical spectrum of the supermassive black hole
(SMBH) binary candidate PG 1302-102, obtained with ESPRESSO at the VLT (R ≃138, 000). Our methodology, based on robust
Bayesian model selection, reveals the presence of multiple narrow emission lines at the expected redshift of the source and confirms
(for Hβ) and detects (for Hγ) the clear presence of redshifted broad components. Additionally, we have discovered a “very broad” and,
if it is associated with the Hβ, “very redshifted” component at λ ≃5000Å. We evaluate two scenarios for explaining the observed broad
emission line (BEL) features in PG 1302-102. In the case in which the redshifted BEL asymmetry arises from the orbital motion of a
putative binary, our measurements coupled with simple estimates of the broad-line region (BLR) sizes suggest that the individual black
hole BLRs are either settled in a single BLR or in the process of merging and, therefore truncated and highly disturbed. Alternatively,
in the scenario of a single SMBH, we explain the distorted emission of the BELs with a nonsymmetric distribution of the BLR clouds;
namely, a thin disk with a spiral perturbation. This BLR configuration is statistically preferred over any empirical multi-Gaussian
fit and simultaneously explains the asymmetric emission of the Hβ and Hγ close to the bulk of the line and any additional excess
(or the lack of it, in the case of the Hγ) at much longer wavelengths. The physical origins of the perturbation are still unclear and a
connection with the possible presence of a black hole binary cannot be ruled out. Given the growing evidence from theoretical and
observational works demonstrating the common presence of disturbed BLRs in active galactic nuclei, we argue that an origin related
to self-gravitating instabilities may be more plausible.

1. Introduction
Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries (SMBHBs) are
thought to be common in the Universe as a natural outcome of
galaxy mergers (Begelman et al. 1980). Such systems are among
the loudest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) potentially de-
tectable with current pulsar timing array campaigns (Verbiest
et al. 2016; Agazie et al. 2024) and future space-based GW inter-
ferometers (e.g., LISA, Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017, 2023). How-
ever, theoretical expectations on the rates of detectable binary
mergers are still highly uncertain; such uncertainties could in
principle be reduced through the electromagnetic identification
of bona fide SMBHBs (De Rosa et al. 2019).

Unfortunately, several challenges complicate the unambigu-
ous identification of these sources and, to date, no definite ob-
servational confirmation of any SMBHB has been made yet.
The only binary candidate, spatially resolved through very long
baseline radio interferometry observations, is the radio galaxy
0402+379 (Rodriguez et al. 2009; Burke-Spolaor 2011) show-
ing two flat-spectrum radio cores with a projected separation of
≈7 pc (see also Kharb et al. 2017 for a 0.35 pc binary in the
spiral galaxy NGC 7674). At smaller separations, unresolvable
with current facilities except for the closest active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), SMBHBs have been searched-for either through photo-
metric variability in their light curve (Valtonen et al. 2008; Ack-
ermann et al. 2015; Graham et al. 2015a; Li et al. 2016; Charisi
et al. 2016; Sandrinelli et al. 2016, 2018; Severgnini et al. 2018;
