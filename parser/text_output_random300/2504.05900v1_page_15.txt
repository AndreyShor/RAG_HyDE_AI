Now, from a theoretical point of view, the natural question to ask is how to justify the addi-
tional term in the action at a fundamental level. One possibility is to think of Sϕ as simply given by
a new matter field. For instance, (infinitely) many models of inflation have been proposed where
the inflaton field is a new matter degree of freedom with some ad-hoc chosen self-potential [115].
However, this way of proceeding would then raise the further question of how to choose the new
matter field and, in particular, how to uniquely select the shape of the self-potential. Instead, to
implement step (ii) above, we now ask whether the strict renormalizability criterion can help us
to obtain a gravitational Lagrangian that naturally incorporates a term like Sϕ.
We already know that if we work in the QFT framework and stay as conservative as possible,
then we end up selecting the strictly renormalizable action of quadratic gravity (7). A key feature
is that the R2 term introduces a scalar degree of freedom with mass squared m2
0 = M2
p/c0, known
as the scalaron. This can also be seen by introducing an auxiliary scalar field ϕ and making a
conformal metric transformation to go to the Einstein frame, in which the action (7) reads [60,68]
SQG[g, ϕ] = SEH[g] + Sϕ[g, ϕ] −c2

for simplicity we have neglected the cosmological constant and with an abuse of notation we have
denoted the transformed metric with the same symbol.
The self-potential has an infinite plateau, which is actually very suitable for a consistent
description of the inflationary phase. In fact, if we drop the Weyl-squared term from (7) (or (14))
we obtain Starobinsky’s model of inflation [116–121],6 which is one the models most favored by
CMB data [113,122]. Let us briefly review the merits of Starobinsky inflation; then in the next
subsection we discuss the additional effects of the Weyl-squared term.
The measurement of the spectral index of the scalar power spectrum, whose leading-order
expression in the slow-roll approximation is ns = 1 −2/Ne [117], constrains the number of e-folds
Ne. Through the measurement of the amplitude, As = m2

p) [119,123], we can then fit
the value of m0. The Planck data [114] give7 ns ≃0.9649±0.0042 and As ≃(2.10±0.03)×10−9,
thus we get Ne ≃57 ± 7 and the following value of the scalaron mass (for Ne = 57):
m0 ≃3.0 × 1013 GeV
⇔
c0 ≃6.5 × 109 ,

which implies that the energy scale of Starobinsky inflation is (3/4)

Here the values of ns and Ne are defined at the horizon crossing with the pivot scale 0.05 Mpc−1.
6Starobinsky inflation was initially discussed as a consequence of one-loop trace anomaly in the context of semi-
classical gravity coupled to conformal matter fields [116–119]. However, soon after it was realized that the model
could be more easily and consistently formulated by starting from the action R + R2 [120,121].
7The ACT collaboration [124, 125] has recently announced a new measured value of the scalar spectral index,
ns ≃0.9666 ± 0.0077, which is consistent with Planck. They also claim that the combination of ACT, Planck
and DESI [126,127] datasets gives ns ≃0.974 ± 0.003. Further analysis of the combined datasets is needed before
drawing definitive conclusions, and indeed we believe that eventually an agreement with Planck data will be found.
