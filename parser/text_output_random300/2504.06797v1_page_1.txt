Inspired by various quantum gravity approaches, we explore quantum field the-
ory where spacetime exhibits scaling properties and dimensional reduction with
changing energy scales, effectively behaving as a multifractal manifold. Working
within canonical quantization, we demonstrate how to properly quantize fields in
such multifractal spacetime. Our analysis reveals that a non-differentiable nature
of spacetime is not merely compatible with quantum field theory but significantly
enhances its mathematical foundation. Most notably, this approach guarantees the
finiteness of the theory at all orders in perturbation theory and enables rigorous
construction of the S-matrix in the interaction picture. The multifractal structure
tames dominant, large-order divergence sources in the perturbative series and re-
solves the Landau pole problem through asymptotic safety, substantially improving
the theory’s behavior in the deep ultraviolet regime. Our formulation preserves
all established predictions of standard quantum field theory at low energies while
offering novel physical behaviors at high energy scales.

Introduction
While the concept of dimension spans broadly across geometry, physics often simplifies it by
stating that we inhabit a three-dimensional space. Our macroscopic experience confirms this,
yet exceptions may emerge at the microscopic level. Mathematics offers various definitions of
dimension – the topological dimension d represents an integer, with d = 3 identified as the
