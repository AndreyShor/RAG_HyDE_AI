for multimodal understanding—integrating vision, lan-
guage, and state inputs commonly observed in robotic sys-
tems. The topological action head applies a filtering mask,
Mtopo, which removes physically invalid solutions before
producing embedded tensors W.
Aτ
t represents a "noisy" action sequence and is randomly
generated after each new observation. The embedded ten-
sors (W) are used as the new filtered observation set and
combine with Aτ
t to produce a vector field, vθ, that fol-
lows the previous fusion rules obtained by Mtopo. vθ is
trained prior to minimize topological loss, transforming
noise distribution to action distribution while respecting
topological constraints. The trained policy then conducts
flow matching with Aτ
t . Following this, Runge-Kutta in-
tegration with 4 steps and step size δ=0.25 is used to trans-
form the starting point into a coherent action sequence At.
The value of Horizon (H) determines the amount of future
actions generated and these are grouped into primitives
(P k
t ) for robotic controller execution.

Training and Workflow
Open source datasets such as OXE as well as our own
hardware dataset are used to generate the actions needed
for specific task completion. These known At sequences
are used to train the policy vθ and adjust weights θ until
any action sequence (Aτ
t ) can be filtered to only include
physically accurate or topologically linked sequences, al-
lowing for accurate flow matching.
OPAL receives observation, Ot, in the form of camera
images, language commands, and proprioception data.
The transformer processes these through encoders as well
as a randomly generated action sequence Aτ
t .
Mtopo-
constrained attention creates a new W representation from
these observations. The trained vector field, vθ, uses this
new Ot to transform random noise to actions and Runge-
Kutta integration samples the action trajectory generating
action sequence At with horizon H=100. The robot exe-
cutes some portion, m, of these actions (P k
t ) and the envi-
ronment changes. A new observation is collected (Ot +1)
and the cycle repeats.
This continuous update cycle allows OPAL to adapt to
what’s actually happening in the environment rather than
blindly following a predetermined plan. This allows the
system to adapt to changes while maintaining physical
consistency through the topological constraints at every
step of the process.

Topological Attention
Topological attention derives from mathematical for-
malisms used to describe systems with non-trivial topo-
logical properties. In such systems, local degrees of free-
dom are subject to constraints that give rise to global topo-
logical invariants. We adapt this mathematical framework
to design a novel attention mechanism that enforces phys-
ical constraints across action sequences in robotic control.
In contrast to standard attention layers that learn uncon-
strained relationships between tokens, our topological at-
tention incorporates explicit physical plausibility via a
masking mechanism Mtopo. This mask encodes “fusion
rules” derived from topological quantum field theory, en-
suring that only valid action transitions are given non-zero
attention scores. Concretely, while classic multi-head at-
tention might allow any token to attend to any other, topo-
logical attention zeroes out attention weights for physi-
cally impossible transitions—e.g., trying to lift an object
before grasping it. This explicit constraint not only im-
proves long-horizon coherence but also reduces the ef-
fective dimensionality of the policy search space, leading
to faster convergence and more robust zero-shot general-
ization. By operating within a mathematically enforced
manifold of feasible action sequences, topological atten-
tion enforces real-world consistency from the ground up,
