Figure 2. Fabrication and characterization of SrTiO3 membranes. a) Schematic illustrating 
the synthesis and transfer of SrTiO3 membranes onto trenched substrates for the suspension. b) 
Optical microscope image of a membrane with lateral size of about 5 millimeters transferred on 
the trenched substrate. The arrow marks a sharp edge perpendicular to the trench.  c) SEM image 
showing the suspended membrane with a sharp edge, clean surface. d) AFM image of transferred 
membrane with step terraces, indicating atomically smooth surface. e) Atomic scanning 
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of SrTiO3 membrane with an overlay of the unit 
cell of a perovskite structure.
