Then P is indecomposable and hence irreducible.
Proof. We deﬁne a partial assignment to the x- and z-variables so that P gets projected to the
form in Lemma 3.3.
Recall that each index s of an x-variable is split as s = s1 ◦s2, where s ∈{0, 1}k, s1 ∈{0, 1}k1,
and s2 ∈{0, 1}k2, where k = k1 + k2. By our assumptions, there are ˙s2, ¨s2 ∈{0, 1}k2 such that
c1◦˙s2 ̸= 0 and cs1◦¨s2 ̸= 0, for some s1 ∈{0, 1}k1 such that s1 ̸= 1. Now the projection is deﬁned as
follows: We maintain one variable for each s1 ∈{0, 1}k1, namely x1◦˙s2, and xs1◦¨s2, for s1 ̸= 1. All
other x-variables we set to 0. Let b be this assignment. Similarly, we project the z-variables via
an assignment c in an analogous way.
Observe that P ′ = P|x=b,z=c is of the form as in Lemma 3.3 and fulﬁlls the assumptions made
there. Hence, we have that P ′ is indecomposable.
Now assume that P is decomposable, That is, we can write P = gh, for non-constant poly-
nomials g, h on disjoint sets of variables. Hence, for g′ = g|x=b,z=c and h′ = h|x=b,z=c, we have
that
P ′ = g′h′.
(10)
Since P ′ is indecomposable, it follows that one of the two factors, say g′, is constant. Hence, g
depends only on the variables that are set to 0 by assignments b and c. However, since P is a
homogeneous polynomial, the factors g and h are homogeneous as well, and therefore g′ = 0. But
this contradicts (10).
The next two lemmas generalize Lemma 3.4 and 3.5 in the same way as Lemma 3.6 generalizes
Lemma 3.3. Their proofs follow the proof of Lemma 3.6 almost literally, so we omit them.
Lemma 3.7. Let k = k1 + k2, m = m1 + m2, and n = n1 + n2, where k1, m1, n1 ≥1. Deﬁne the
polynomials

where
• s, u, and v run over the strings in {0, 1}k, {0, 1}m, and {0, 1}n, respectively,
• xs is a variable for each s ∈{0, 1}k and similarly for the zu and wv, and
• cs, du,v ∈C such that for s = s1 ◦s2, where si ∈{0, 1}ki, and u = u1 ◦u2, where ui ∈{0, 1}mi,
and v = v1 ◦v2, where vi ∈{0, 1}ni, for i = 1, 2, we have
– ∃s2 c1◦s2 ̸= 0 and ∃u2, v2 d1◦u2,1◦v2 ̸= 0
– ∃s1 ̸= 1 ∃s2 cs ̸= 0,
– ∃u1 ̸= 1 ∃u2 ∃v du,v ̸= 0 and ∃u ∃v1 ̸= 1 ∃v2 du,v ̸= 0.
