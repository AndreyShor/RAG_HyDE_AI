Figure 2: Inverse design workflow. A desired family of curves {Γβ} is given as input. A related
function B(x, y) is constructed in agreement with eq. (6), from which we calculate surface patterns
for the confining plates (the calculation depends on the choice of physical control parameter β, see
text and figure. 3). Bottom: at each value of β (here the rotation ϕ of the top plate), Γβ emerges
as the equilibrium disclination curve.

Taking the differential of eq. (4a) with respect to β, we obtain
