 
Figure IV: a. Predicted and true phase values across different gap sizes. Points that appear as single markers may represent 
multiple overlapping data points with similar values. b. Direct comparison between the true and predicted values of phase. 
Color scale indicates prediction error in sine/cosine space. The perfect-prediction is shown by red dashed line. Black arrows 
highlight a data point where true phase is 0, while the prediction is near 2Ï€. Despite the large numerical difference 
between these values, the color indicates a low error. 
 
 
 
Figure V provides insight into the angular error distribution for Dataset A and Dataset B. The figure 
shows the angular error from one representative run for each dataset. Both histograms exhibit a 
positive skew, indicating that most predicted phase values have low error. Across all 10 runs, the 
majority of errors remain below 0.2 radians for both datasets.
