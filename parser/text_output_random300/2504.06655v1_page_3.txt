Again, interfaces play a substantial role in diverse fields, such as drug interactions within biological 
membranes,5,6 heterogeneous catalytic systems, paint industries, environmental and geoscientific 
studies,7,8 interactions between water droplets and minerals, as well as photovoltaic device9 ap- 
plications. Non-linear spectroscopic techniques being non-invasive or non-destructive, provide 
a novel perspective to understand the properties of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interface of 
nanoparticles, the molecular orientation and the distribution of molecules at particle surfaces in 
solution, interfacial structure of surfactants, the dynamics and transport properties.10,11 
Over the past three decades, a wealth of literature has been dedicated to exploring the appli- 
cations of non-linear spectroscopic studies in the realm of surfaces and interfaces. Commenc- 
ing with conventional second harmonic and sum frequency generation techniques, the field has 
witnessed rapid advancements in novel methodologies for probing surface and interface proper- 
ties.12–18 These include cutting-edge techniques such as heterodyne detected two-dimensional vi- 
brational sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS), vibrational sum-frequency generation microscopy, 
as well as polarimetric angle-resolved second-harmonic scattering (AR-SHS), among others.19–25 
Shen et al.. demonstrated the significance and versatility of optical second harmonic generation 
and sum-frequency generation in surface and interface studies. 
Furthermore, recent advancements highlight the utility of phase-sensitive sum-frequency vibra- 
tional spectroscopic techniques in obtaining both the real and imaginary components of the surface 
nonlinear spectral response. This approach enables the determination of water species orientations 
at the interface.19,20,26–28 The flip-flopping behavior of interfacial water molecules, triggered by 
the opposite charge of surfactants, has been investigated by applying heterodyne-detected broad- 
band vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy.21 A recent in-depth study has shown 
how the flip of water molecules happens in the Stern layer with the change of pH compared to the 
diffuse layer.29 This spectroscopic technique has also been utilized to capture the intricate spec- 
tra arising from air/water interfaces containing charged surfactants. The rearrangement of water 
molecules at the air/water interface, driven by the objective of minimizing surface free energy 
through the formation of hydrogen bonds with neighboring water molecules, has been extensively
