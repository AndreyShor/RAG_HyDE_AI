where nh is the count of hidden layer nodes and nvar is the number of input variables. It is
necessary to identify the collection of weights that minimizes the error function and is obtained by
replacing a random set of weights ⃗ωρ by the small amount −∇⃗ωE.
⃗ωρ+1 = ⃗ωρ −η∇⃗ωE

If the user-set learning rate (LearningRate) option, where η > 0, determines how quickly the
weights are altered. The weights of the subsequent techniques are used to refresh the output layer
using Eq (8equation.4.8), the weights of the following methods are used for refreshing the output
