Figure 3.11: Intrinsic charm and Z+charm production at LHCb. Left: the LHCb measurements of
Z boson production in association with charm-tagged jets, Rc
j, at √s = 13 TeV, compared with our
default prediction which includes an intrinsic charm component, as well as with a variant in which we
impose the vanishing of the intrinsic charm component. The thicker (thinner) bands in the LHCb data
indicate the statistical (total) uncertainty, while the theory predictions include both PDF and MHOU.
Right: the correlation coefficient between the charm PDF at Q = 100 GeV in NNPDF4.0 and the LHCb
measurements of Rc

perturbative charm. Since the experimental covariance matrix is not available for the LHCb data
we determine the χ2 values assuming two limiting scenarios for the correlation of experimental
systematic uncertainties. Namely, we either add in quadrature statistical and systematic errors
(ρsys = 0), or alternatively we assume that the total systematic uncertainty is fully correlated
between yZ bins (ρsys = 1). Fit quality is always significantly better in our default intrinsic
charm scenario than with perturbative charm. As it is clear from Fig. 3.11 (left), the somewhat
poor fit quality is mostly due to the first rapidity bin, which is essentially uncorrelated to the
amount of intrinsic charm (see Fig. 3.11, right).
The LHCb Z+charm data are then included in the PDF determination through Bayesian
reweighting [257, 258]. The χ2/Ndat values obtained using the PDFs found after their inclusion
are given in Table 3.2. They are computed by combining the PDF and experimental covariance
matrix so both sources of uncertainty are included — MHOUs from the hadronic matrix element
are negligible, see computation the details below. The fit quality is seen to improve only mildly,
