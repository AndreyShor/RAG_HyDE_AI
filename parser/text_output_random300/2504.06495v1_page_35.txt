This permits direct characterization of the conditional process given survival, which would
be more complicated in the discrete-time setting.
Theorem 4 shows that the stationary distribution of Xτ, conditional on survival until
time τ, is exponential, shifted by the boundary log(ǫ), with rate µ/σ2. In steady state, this
means that most surviving paths lie only about σ2/µ above the boundary. This may seem
at odds with our earlier argument that the process should be far from the boundary at the
time of the experiment, but we will resolve this apparent contradiction in Section 6.
Long-run behaviour of E[Φτ|Φτ > 0]
The continuous-time version of the original branching process (before rescaling and taking
logs) and of the exogenous threshold are given by Φτ = ατ exp(Xτ) and ξτ = ǫατ, respectively.
Using Theorem 4, we can now calculate the expectation of Φτ/ξτ conditional on survival in
the steady state:
lim

E[Φτ|Φτ > 0]

where we assume β := µ/σ2 > 1 (otherwise the expectation does not exist), and in the ﬁnal

The last display shows that our branching process with exogenous threshold rule ξτ = ǫατ

, which
coincides exactly with our endogenous threshold rule in (25). While this does not constitute
a full proof of our claim in Section 5.1 above — since the model remains deﬁned by an
exogenous threshold — it serves as a crucial consistency check.
The calculation also reveals what makes β = 1 special: it is the critical point at which
E[Φτ|Φτ > 0] ceases to be well-deﬁned in the steady state. This explains why our endogenous
threshold rule, formulated in terms of E[Φτ|Φτ > 0], naturally singles out β = 1 as the special
case in the limit ε →0, though we still have to formally derive this result for the actual model
