FIG. 6.
Left: Beam spot width along beam scan direction, as calculated from pulse-width measurements at 300 K with 660 nm
photons. Distance units use the same calibration described in Figure 4. The 4σ width is shown in red. Right: Corresponding
results for the same system configuration when operated cold.
Moving forward, we anticipate a number of further im-
provements to the system in support of a broader range of
cryogenic imaging techniques. First, we have completed
the design of a smaller system that does not require a
secondary flat mirror to achieve the same scan area and
beam spot size of the present system. The new design
uses optics with smaller focal lengths than used now, and
is compact enough so that the majority of the beam ex-
tends outside the primary enclosure. This system should
be capable of diffraction-limited spot sizes < 10 µm for
the shortest scan range and a single-mode fiber input.
The beam modulation components will be housed in a
package roughly 50 mm x 25 mm x 25 mm in volume
that will couple to a single-mode output fiber. This new
system will be useful for producing few µm-scale map-
ping of small-featured devices, such as semiconducting
spin qubits, and will be mountable inside the bore of a
standard cryogenic magnet.
Second, our long-term goal is to realize MEMS scan-
ning across the full range of wavelengths supported by
commercial reflective optics. The current system is fun-
damentally limited not by the mirrors and the MEMS
performance, but by the multimode fibers and their mode
structures. Operation at ∼single-µm wavelengths will
involve using single-mode IR fiber optics. We plan to test
such a configuration on the bench before it is deployed by
collaborators in a current (v.2) scanner. For longer wave-
lengths, we plan to couple the focusing unit to mm-wave
capillary waveguides, with the goal of achieving mm-scale
spot sizes that can be used to characterize cm-scale arrays
in conjunction with 4 K photon sources. This approach
will enable higher-fidelity ground-based testing of mm-
wave imaging arrays and in situ dark-box testing with
a suitable photon absorber added to the MEMS system.
It also will allow us to steer ambient photons coupled to
the waveguide away from the device under test.
