terns can capture both conventional two-center bonds
and delocalized multicenter bonds, with the degree of
multipartite entanglement serving as a quantitative in-
dex of bond strength and aromaticity. Finally, comple-
menting these theoretical advances, Stein and Reiher [17]
developed an automated protocol for active orbital space
selection in multireference calculations, effectively lever-
aging entanglement measures to identify strongly corre-
lated orbitals and streamline computational processes.
The goal of this work is to combine these quan-
tum information non-stabilizerness insights with quan-
tum chemistry.
We conduct an analysis of the non-
stabilizerness in the H2 molecule as it forms and breaks
a bond. By doing so, we aim to illustrate how concepts
like magic, alongside more standard notions like entangle-
ment together provide a more complete characterization
of the electronic wavefunction’s quantum nature.
The
rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first sum-
marize the theoretical background and definitions of the
various magic proxies used in this letter in the context
fermionic systems. We then describe our methodology
for computing our reference ab initio ground state of the
H2 dimer accross a range of interatomic distances. We
finally present the results, showing the behavior of magic
as a function of interatomic distance, and provides a dis-
cussion of our observations, and discuss in some possible
experimental implications in the outlook section.

of
Magic—Non-stabilizerness concepts have be explored
mostly in quantum spin chain context [18–24]. These no-
tion can of course be defined for fermionic systems in vari-
ous defferent ways. One possible trajectory is fermioniza-
tion in the form of Jordan-Wigner transformation from a
system of spin 1/2 degrees of freedom, following then the
work of Wootters [25, 26]. Another direction could be to
define a Grassmann valued phase space, and a notion of
fermionic Wigner function defined thereof, following the
seminal work of Cahill and Glauber [27]. We will instead
follow the approach of [28–31] to leverage the structure of
the Majorana group [32], fermionic analogue of the Pauli
group, and define the fermionic Wigner function in terms
of Majorana strings and discrete phase space.
Given a collection of n fermionic creation and annihi-
lation operators cp and c†
p, following [31, 32] we intro-
duce for each mode the Hermitian Majorana operators
η2p−1 = cp + c†
p and η2p = i(cp −c†
p). We then define the
Majorana strings
Mv = iv·Ωvηv1
1 ηv2
2 . . . ηv2n−1
2n−1 ηv2n
2n ,
(1)
where v = (v1, v2, . . . , v2n−1, v2n)t ∈(Z2)2n is a binary
vector, and Ωis a (2n)×(2n) square matrix with zeros on
the diagonal, zeros on the upper-right triangle, and ones
on the lower-left triangle.
The prefactor iv·Ωv ensures
Hermiticity of the Majorana strings. Γ = (Z2)2n plays
here the role of discrete phase space for the fermionic
system. The Majorana strings form a basis of Hermitian
operators, and given a quantum state represented by a
density matrix ρ, one can decompose it in the Majorana
basis as
ρ =
1
22n
X
v∈Γ
Tr(ρMv)Mv.
(2)
We then call the quantity
Wρ(v) = Tr(ρMv)
(3)
the fermionic Wigner function of the state ρ.
Given this fermionic Wigner function we define its Lp
norm as
||Wρ||p =
"X

|Wρ(v)|p

Following intuition from the discrete Wigner function of
Wootters [25, 26], we define the mana as the L1 norm
instead:

The filtered α-stabilizer Renyi entropy FSα is defined
like the α-stabilizer Renyi entropy but removes the often
dominating contribution of the identity v = (0, 0, . . . , 0)t
and parity operator v = (1, 1, . . . , 1)t from the sum defin-
ing the Lp norm [30], whose contribution can become
dominant, especially in the large number of modes limit.
The Lp norms of the discrete Wigner function of a
fermionic state capture how broadly the quantum state
spreads over the discrete phase space Γ.
The H2 dimer in second quantization: computing the
ground state across dissociation—In the second quanti-
zation formalism, the electronic Hamiltonian (within the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation) of a molecular sys-
tem is expressed in terms of fermionic creation (c†
p) and
annihilation (cq) operators defined with respect to a cho-
sen orbital basis. For a generic set of orbitals, the Hamil-
tonian is written as [33]
ˆH =

where hpq are the one-body integrals (incorporating the
kinetic energy of electrons and their interaction with the
nuclei), ⟨pq|rs⟩are the two-body integrals (accounting for
electron-electron repulsion), and the quantum numbers
p, q, r, s run over the complete set of orbitals in the ba-
sis [34, 35]. This non-relativistic field theory representa-
tion encapsulates all the many-body effects and provides
