The intricate interplay between electron correlation, band topology and spontaneous time-
reversal symmetry breaking could give rise to emergent phenomena in quantum materials, e.g.,
fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE). Such FQAHE has been long sought-after18–22,
not only because of the intriguing physics involving exotic fractional charge excitations in zero
magnetic field23, but also for potential applications in topological quantum computation24. Re-
cently, FQAHE has been reported in twisted MoTe2 bilayers25–28 and rhombohedral pentalayer
graphene aligned on BN substrate (aligned R5G/BN)1. In aligned R5G/BN, the electron correlation
and nontrivial topology arise from the intrinsic topological flat band of rhombohedral graphene,
whose interplay with the moir´e potential is critical for understanding the physics of FQAHE, how-
ever, the role of the moir´e potential has been highly debated. On one hand, FQAHE has been
experimentally observed only in “aligned” rhombohedral graphene (RG) on BN substrate1–3 which
all share a large moir´e superlattice period λm ≥10 nm, suggesting that the moir´e potential is likely
essential. On the other hand, while FQAHE1–3 and a rich variety of phases, such as the extended
quantum anomalous Hall effect (EQAHE)29 and superconductivity30, have been discovered in the
moir´e-distant regime when electrons are pushed away from the moir´e interface, rather than in the
moir´e-proximal regime31, raising puzzles about the actual role of the moir´e potential. Theoretical
calculations adopting various interaction schemes have provided differing views on the moir´e po-
tential, such as interaction-driven anomalous Hall crystal with spontaneous symmetry breaking4–10,
fractional Chern insulator driven by the moir´e potential12–14. Direct experimental observation of
the topological flat band in R5G and its interplay with moir´e bands is therefore critical for resolv-
ing puzzles regarding the moir´e potential and for providing a more complete understanding of the
