fundamental physics of this FQAHE material platform.
Here by performing nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (NanoARPES,
Fig. 1a) measurements on specially designed aligned and non-aligned samples, we directly probe
the topological flat band in R5G and reveal the effect of the moir´e potential in aligned R5G/BN
sample. Thanks to the high-quality NanoARPES data, key hopping parameters are extracted by fit-
ting the experimental data with a tight-binding model, laying a solid foundation for describing the
electronic structure of RG. More importantly, we find that the aligned R5G/BN shows a stronger
flat band intensity, suggesting that the topological flat band on the top surface is enhanced by the
moir´e potential on the backside of the sample. Our results highlight the pivotal role of the moir´e
potential in modifying the topological flat band in R5G/BN, which is critical for the emergent
correlated electronic states.
Construction and characterization of aligned and non-aligned R5G/BN samples
The low-energy electronic structure of few layer RG is characterized by two touching flat
bands with dispersion E ≈pN where N is the number of layers32,33, as schematically illustrated in
Fig. 1b. In the bulk limit (infinite N), the flat band forms the “drumhead” topological surface state,
which is protected by the topological properties of Dirac nodal lines of the bulk states34. For few
layer RG, while the electronic structure of trilayer RG has been reported35–37, clear experimental
observation of the flat band electronic structure of R5G, especially a proper determination of its
key hopping parameters, is still lacking. Moreover, revealing the effect of the moir´e potential
on the topological flat band in aligned R5G/BN is even more complicated and challenging. In
