aN3LO PDFs. We estimate the total uncertainty by adding in quadrature to the PDF uncertainty
(which already includes the MHOU from the theory predictions used in the fit) a further theory
uncertainty, taken equal to the difference between the central value at given perturbative order,
and that at the previous perturbative order (so at NNLO from the difference to NLO, and so
on). This now also includes the MHOU due to change in the matching from 4FNS to 3FNS,
but also the shift in the 4FNS result that is in principle already accounted for by the MHOU.
Also, it conservatively assumes that the shift between the current order and the next is equal to
that from the previous order, rather than smaller. Results obtained with this conservative error
estimate are shown in Fig. 4.24. It is clear that the significance of intrinsic charm is increased
somewhat when going from NNLO to aN3LO. It is now also somewhat increased already at
NNLO in comparison to the result of Ref. [1], despite the more conservative uncertainty estimate,
thanks to the increased accuracy of MHOU PDFs and the consistent and improved treatment
of matching aN3LO conditions. Indeed, local significance at the peak is now more than three
sigma for the default fit.
