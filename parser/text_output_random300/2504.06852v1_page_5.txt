For monochromatic circularly polarized (CP) light, we

EFFECTIVE TIME-REVERSAL
SYMMETRY ˆT ′
The effective time-reversal symmetry (ETRS) ˆT ′ is
the operator of reversing time and the direction of
spin44,66–68. A general Hamiltonian is transformed with
the ETRS operator as66
ˆT ′H(k)

ˆT ′−1
= H(−k) = H∗(k).
So
U †(k) ˆH(k)U(k) = U †(k) ˆH∗(−k)U(k) = ε(k)
and
U T (−k) ˆ
H∗(−k)U ∗(−k) = [U ∗(−k)]† ˆ
H(k)U ∗(−k) = ε(−k).
Under the condition of ε(k) = ε(−k), we can see that
U †(k) ˆH(k)U(k) = [U ∗(−k)]† ˆH(k)U ∗(−k) = ε(k). So
we can replace U(k) by U ∗(−k) (only one phase factor
apart). Therefore, under the ETRS, the Berry connec-
tion satisfies
Aa,mn(k) =
X

mp(k)i∂kaUpn(k)

Upm(−k)i∂kaU ∗

U †
np(−k)i∂−kaUpm(−k)
= Aa,nm(−k).
In particular, when m = n, intraband Berry connec-
tion satisfies Aa,n(k) = Aa,n(−k). So Berry curvature
Ωn(k) = ∇k × An(k) satisfies Ωn(k) = −Ωn(−k).
Therefore, under the ETRS, the longitudinal magnon
spin (energy) photoconductivitiy in Eq. 17 and Eq. 21
equal to zero. In order to study the control of the lon-
gitudinal magnon photo-transport, we need to break the
ETRS of the system.

MODEL CALCULATION
In this section, we take a model calculation of the
magnon photo-transport in two-dimensional collinear fer-
romagnets. As shown in Fig. 1, the models we calculate
are two-dimensional Hexagonal lattice42,43 and Kagome
lattice34,40,66. Here, a1 and a2 are the basis vectors for
real space lattice.
The Hamiltonian of models can be
expressed as

Model calculation of magnon photo-transport

laxation time. The Hamiltonian can be expressed as
