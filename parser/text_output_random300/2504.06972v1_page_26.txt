at T = 2 K (a) and TMC = 15 mK (b), respectively. ρxx at the IQAH, FQAH and RIQAH states 
exhibits local dips and disperses with B and νh. Different groups of colored circles represent the 
positions of (νh, B) where ρxx reaches its local minimum in the IQAH, FQAH and RIQAH states,

Based on data at T = 2 K, the fitted Chen numbers for the νh = 1 IQAH state and νh = 2/3 FQAH 
state are C = 1.06 ± 0.07 and C = 0.61 ± 0.05, respectively. For TMC = 15 mK, considering the 
fitting results at both positive and negative magnetic fields, we estimate the Chen numbers for 
the νh = 2/3 and 3/5 FQAH states to be C = 0.61 ± 0.05 and C = 0.56 ± 0.05. These values are 
in consistent with the measured quantized Hall conductance of the IQAH and FQAH states. 
However, for the RIQAH states, the observed dispersion does not align with the expected value 
of C = 1, as indicated by the measured ρxy quantized at h/e2.
