B. Nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation in 2D+1
We consider a perfectly monochromatic field E written
using the convention of Eq. (5) propagating in a Kerr
medium of susceptibility defined in Eq. (11). Injecting
this field in Eq. (1) yields the propagation equation for
the field envelope E0:
∇2E0 + ω2
c2

1 + χ(1)(r)

E0 = −3
4
ω2
c2 χ(3)|E0|2E0. (20)
Note the
3
4 prefactor in front of χ(3) which follows
from the definition of E0 in Eq.(5).
This is the most
commonly used convention, although others are found
in the literature (Grynberg et al., 2010). Some authors
define E0 as E = E0e−iωt + c.c., which leads to a factor
of 3 instead of 3
4.
The field is decomposed as E0 = Eeik0z and the slowly
varying envelope approximation is applied, where the en-
velope E varies slowly along the propagation axis z com-
pared to the carrier wavelength k0 = n′
0

c . This approx-
imation implies that:
∇2E =


∇2
⊥E −k2
0E + 2ik0
∂E

eik0z.
(22)
Note that this approximation also implies that the field
is paraxial, as the envelop can’t change significantly over
a wavelength, the wavefront must be flat enough to keep
the beam near the optical axis. With these approxima-
tions, we decompose the Laplacian of Eq. (20) as follows:
∇2E =

∇2
⊥E + ∂2E
∂z2 −k2
0E + 2ik0
∂E

eik0z
(23)


∇2
⊥E −k2
0E + 2ik0
∂E

eik0z.
(24)
Injecting this expression into Eq. (20) leads to the parax-
ial wave equation:
∇2
⊥E +2ik0
∂E
∂z −k2
0E + ω2
c2 (1+χ(1)(r))E = −3k2χ(3)|E|2E.
(25)
The refractive index is split
p
1 + χ(1) into real and imag-
inary parts since they lead to different effects, and we
rewrite the linear susceptibility as:
ω2
c2

1 + χ(1)
= (k0+iα

0 +ik0α−α2

0 +ik0α,
(26)
where α = 2ωn′′
0
c
is the linear loss coefficient for the in-
tensity, hence the factor 1
2 in front of the electric field.
In the following, it is assumed that the medium is trans-
parent, so n′′
0 ≪n′
0 =⇒α ≪k0. We neglect the term
α2 since α is much smaller than k0, but we keep the term
ik0α since k2
0 will cancel out in the propagation equation.
We then find:
∇2
⊥E +2ik0
∂E
∂z +ik0αE + ω2
c2 δχ(1)(r)E = −3
4
ω2
c2 χ(3)|E|2E.
(27)
A word of caution here: one should be careful when com-
paring the coefficients to those obtained in other works.
Choosing the convention E = Eeiωt+c.c. eliminates the 1
4
coefficient in front of the nonlinearity. Moreover, adopt-
ing a convention for the susceptibility that absorbs fac-
tors arising from powers of E causes the factor 3 in front
of the nonlinearity to disappear.
The susceptibilities are replaced with their respective re-
fractive index expressions of Eq. (16) and the 2D+1 non-
linear Schr¨odinger equation Eq. (28) is obtained:
i∂E
∂z = −1

(28)
In general the potential term
δn0(r)
n0
and the nonlinear
term nE
2
n0 are complex as the refractive index n0 is com-
plex. However these terms can be approximated real if:
ℑ(k0 n2
n0 I) ≪α/2 and ℑ(k0
δn0(r)
n0
) ≪α/2. The imaginary
part of the nonlinear term can be rewritten as:

where the transparent medium approximation has been
made, i.e., n′′

to safely neglect the imaginary part of the nonlinear term,
this condition must hold: n2I ω

C. Mapping the Gross-Pitaevskii and the nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equations
The concept of fluids of light relies on the mathemati-
cal mapping that can be made between the NLSE and
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes
the evolution of the macroscopic wavefunction ψ of a
weakly interacting Bose gas, with an additional damp-
ing term γ:
