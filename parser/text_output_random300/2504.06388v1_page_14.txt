the electron-surface interaction and zF(t) accounts for the interaction of the active
electron with the electric ﬁeld , within the length gauge. We consider a laser pulse of
the form of Eq. (13). The Hamiltonian in Eq. (19) can be separated in the Cartesian
coordinates H(x, y, z, t) = Hx(x) + Hy(y) + Hz(z, t) with Hx(x) = −∂2/∂x2 and
Hy(y) = −∂2/∂y2 corresponding to the Hamiltonian of a free particle, and
Hz(z, t) = −∂2/∂z2 + VS(z) + zF(t),

corresponding to a one-dimensional model of the surface. The electron dynamics is
determined by the TDSE in Eq. (1). As the solutions of Hx(x, t) and Hy(y, t) are
just plane waves, we circumscribe our problem to solve the TDSE in the ˆz direction
perpendicular to the solid surface.
4.1. Jellium surface model
First, we analyze photoemission for the simplest possible model for the electron-surface
interaction: the jellium model, where the electron-surface interaction is modeled as a
slab of width a and depth V0 = EF + Φ, corresponding to a Fermi energy EF and a
work function of the metal surface Φ, thus
VS(z) = −V0Θ(a/2 −|z|).
(21)
As the room temperature is much less than the Fermi temperature of metals, the
initial state corresponds to a set of electrons with energy levels below the Fermi level
(from the bottom of the potential well), i.e., −V0 < E < −V0 −EF = −Φ, due to the
Pauli exclusion principle (see Fig. 8). Therefore, we must calculate the photoelectron
spectrum as [29]
