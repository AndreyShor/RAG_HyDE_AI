We will also need the correlation function D(r) of the spatial density fluctuations ∆n(r) ≡
n(r) −¯n. The average of the square of the Fourier components of the density fluctuations
∆n(q) can be obtained from the density response via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem,
but it is easier to calculate it directly from geometrical considerations [57]:
⟨|∆n(q)|2⟩= ¯n −

Here nF(k) = Θ(−ξ(k)) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function with ξ(k) ≡ε(k) −µ, and

Compare to the fluctuations of a classical free field φ(r):

The density-density correlation function which is the Fourier transform of (B21) reads [57]:
D(r1 −r2) ≡D(r) = ¯nδ(r) −(G(r))2 .
(B24)
The first term on the r.h.s. of (B21) gives the rigid delta-function contribution to D(r),
while the fluctuation contribution ∝S(q) combines into square of the spatial representation
of a properly taken zero-time limit of the single-particle Green’s function at T = 0:
