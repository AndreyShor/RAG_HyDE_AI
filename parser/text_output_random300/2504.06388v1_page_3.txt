results for simple potentials obtained via both projection techniques and the WOM. In
Sec. 4, we apply the methods to the photoionization of metallic surfaces. Finally, Sec.
5 summarizes our ﬁndings and outlines future directions for the systematic study of
metal photoionization under ultrashort laser pulses. Unless otherwise stated, atomic
units are used throughout.
2. Theory
2.1. Resolution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
We consider the ionization of a one-dimensional system consisting of a single electron
bound in a short-range potential V (z) and subjected to an external time-dependent
electric ﬁeld.
Within the dipole approximation, the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation (TDSE) takes the form
i ∂
∂t|ψ(t)⟩= [H0 + Hint(t)] |ψ(t)⟩,
(1)
where the unperturbed Hamiltonian is H0 = p2/2 + V (z), with the ﬁrst term
representing the kinetic energy of the electron, and the second term describing its
interaction with an attractive potential that models, for example, an atom, molecule,
or solid-state system.
The term Hint(t) accounts for the interaction with the external ﬁeld. In the length
gauge, this interaction is given by Hint(t) = zF(t), where F(t) is the time-dependent
electric ﬁeld. Under the inﬂuence of this ﬁeld, an electron initially in a bound state
|φi⟩may either be excited to another bound state |φn⟩with energy En, or ionized into
the continuum, ending in a state |φk⟩characterized by asymptotic momentum k and
energy E = k2/2.
To numerically solve Eq. (1), we use the staggered leap-frog method [19, 20].
This is a robust time propagation technique commonly applied in the simulation of
atomic and molecular few-body dynamics [21]. The method provides an eﬃcient and
stable approach for evolving the wavefunction under the inﬂuence of strong and time-
dependent external ﬁelds.
2.2. Projection onto stationary waves
Once the TDSE [Eq. (1)] has been solved, the time-propagated wave function
ψ(z, t) = ⟨z|ψ(t)⟩is available. After the conclusion of the electric pulse of duration
τ, the electron is subject only to the inﬂuence of the time-independent potential V (z)
Therefore, the kinetic energy is conserved, and the asymptotic momentum k is a good
quantum number. We consider in this paper only symmetric short-range potentials,
i.e., V (z) = V (−z). Hence, both bound φj(z) and continuum φk(z) eigenstates of the
time-independent Hamiltonian H0 have deﬁnite parity, which means that they will
be either even [φ(e)
i (z) = φ(e)
i (−z)] or odd [φ(o)
i (z) = −φ(o)
i (−z)]. The wave function
ψ(z, τ) at the end of the interaction with the external force can be written as a linear
combination of stationary eigenstates
