Figure 8: The 18-variable problem hyperparameter search for the VQE state vector solver. In Figure 8a the optimal
ansatz was found, setting the penalty coefficient at λ = 2, and using the standard expectation value objective function
(without CVaR). In Figure 8b to find the optimal λ, the RealAmplitudes ansatz was used as well as the standard
objective function. In Figure 8c the optimal α CVaR parameter was searched for using the RealAmplitudes ansatz
and λ = 7. In Figure 8d the optimal λ parameter was searched for again, now with CVaR α = 0.4. Finally, in Figure
8e the optimal ansatz was found to be RealAmplitudes (this time with lower standard deviation) using α = 0.4 and
λ = 3. The results were repeated 5 times (apart from in the α plot, which was repeated 10 times), with mean values
used, and the standard deviation included as error bars.
