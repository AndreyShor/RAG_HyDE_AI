by Eq. (13) with ω = 0.8 a.u., F0 = 0.5, and τ = 47.12 a.u.. (a) Projections onto

of n = 1, 2, and 3, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. On one hand, we ﬁnd that the high-
frequency ﬂuctuations vanish within the WOM approach.
Additionally, while the
broad multiphoton peaks are somewhat smeared for n = 1, they become well-deﬁned
with increasing values of n, with n = 3 being suﬃcient for an acceptable resolution. In
Fig. 2b, we set n = 3 and analyze the calculated spectrum for three distinct γ values:
0.07, 0.045, and 0.02 a.u. The near-threshold structure, with peaks at approximately
E ≃0 and 0.2 a.u., necessitates a narrow window with γ = 0.02 a.u. However, at high
energy, near the third multiphoton peak at E ∼2 a.u., the spurious oscillations are not
completely smoothed, even with this γ value. Thus, a compromise must be struck to
ﬁnd a suitable γ value that addresses the near-threshold structures while mitigating the
spurious oscillations at higher energies, which can sometimes prove challenging. We
then compare the outcome of the WOM with the electron emission spectrum obtained
using our SPM. This was calculated by projecting the wave function at the end of
the pulse, ψ(z, τ), onto the scattering waves Ψ(l,±)
