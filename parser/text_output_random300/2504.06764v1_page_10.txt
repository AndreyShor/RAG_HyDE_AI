Materials and Methods 
Growth of vdW crystals 
High-quality FCGT single crystals were grown by the self-flux method from a mixture of 
high purity Fe powders (99.95%), Co powders (99.998%), Ga lumps (99.9999%), and Te 
powders (99.99%) in a molar ratio of 1.7: 0.3: 1:2. The mixture was sealed in an evacuated 
quartz tube and heated to 1273 K at a rate of 5 K/min, and then held for one day for solid 
reactions. Then the temperature was slowly decreased to 1053 K at a rate of 1.8 K/h. 
Sizable single crystals with a typical size of 2 × 2 × 0.02 mm were obtained after a natural 
cooling process. 
CrSBr single crystals were synthesized by the chemical vapor transport method using 
chromium (99.99%), sulphur (99.9999%), and bromine (99.9999%), combined with a 
stoichiometry of 1: 1: 1, sealed in a quartz tube under high vacuum. The quartz tube was 
heated to 973 K and maintained at this temperature for 15 hours. Then, the source and 
growth ends were kept at 1123 and 1173 K, respectively. After 25 h, the temperature 
gradient was reversed and the temperature was maintained for 5 days. The needle-like 
CrSBr single crystals with the lengths of 2 cm could be obtained after furnace cooling. 
Fabrication of vdW devices 
To prepare the Pt/FCGT devices, FCGT flakes were first transferred onto SiO2/Si 
substrates using mechanical exfoliation in the glovebox enclosure with inert gas 
atmosphere. Then, the Pt (6-10 nm) layer was deposited onto the FCGT flake using dc 
magnetron sputtering (AJA) with a low power of 20 W to eliminate the damage of the 
FCGT/Pt interface by the bombardment of heavy Pt atoms (Fig. S20). The base pressure 
for the sputtering was <5 × 10−8 torr. The Pt layer was further patterned into a Hall bar 
geometry using ultraviolet (UV) lithography and Ar ion milling, with the FCGT flake 
located under the cross centre of the Hall bar. The width of the Hall bar is 5-10 μm.  
To prepare the Pt/FCGT/CrSBr devices, CrSBr flakes (thickness around 10-30 nm) were 
mechanically exfoliated on SiO2/Si substrate while FCGT flakes (thickness below 10 nm) 
were mechanically exfoliated on Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps inside glovebox 
same as up mentioned and sequentially the FCGT flake was staked directly on the top of 
CrSBr flake with the help of 2D micro transfer system inside glovebox. Then, the Pt (10 
nm) layer was deposited onto the bilayer heterostructure using dc magnetron sputtering
