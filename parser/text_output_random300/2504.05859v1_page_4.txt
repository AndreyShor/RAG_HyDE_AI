within several ps9. In this regard, semiconductor transition metal dichalcogenides 
(TMD) with band gap of ~eV and strong light-matter interaction12–14 are better 
candidates for HCSCs. Ultrafast dynamics studies8,15,16 have revealed fast interface 
charge transfer within 100 femtoseconds (fs) in TMD heterostructures, in which 
photoexcited carriers transfer to the lower-energy band in the other layer and all excess 
energy is lost. The extraction of hot carriers in TMD to a nearby higher-energy band17 
still remains a challenge, which is vital for realizing HCSCs.  
In this study, we fabricate a dual-gated MoSe2/hBN/WS2 heterostructure wherein 
MoSe2 and WS2 play the roles of the photoabsorber and the ESC of HCSCs, 
respectively, and perform transient reflectance (TR) spectroscopy. We demonstrate 
highly tunable hot-electron extraction dynamics from the conduction band of MoSe2 to 
the higher-energy conduction band of WS2. Specifically, we develop a rigorous method 
of extracting 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 from the TR spectrum, as well as photoinduced increment of lattice 
temperature. Upon electron doping MoSe2, 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 shows a giant enhancement with a 
factor of several tens that arises from efficient scatterings between hot excitons and 
doped electrons, and scales linearly within a wide range of applied electric field. Our 
results highlight the exciton-electron interaction as a novel strategy for harvesting the 
excess energy of hot carriers in TMD materials.
