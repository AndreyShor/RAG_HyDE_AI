Figure B1. Minimum value of κ1 in the Gamma distribution, Eq. B.1, as a function
of n (with n = m) for the real and complex cases. The values become negative when
n ≤16.
Figure B2. Derived largest singular value distributions (lines) [Eq. B.3] compared to
empirically calculated histograms of largest singular values for 600 randomly sampled
matrices. The colours indicate different matrix sizes. It is clear that the approximate
PDF fλ1(y) is quite accurate, even for small n(= m), and errors that do occur
(noticeably around the left tail of the distribution) dissipate rapidly with increased
matrix size.
to the low overall variance, and that indeed in theory we must have κ1, λ1 > 0 as a result
of the construction of the Wishart matrix and singular values. The fact that fκ1(z) can
be defined for z < 0, or that fλ1(y) could be interpreted as being defined for imaginary
y for n ≤16 can be seen as a compounding error caused by successive approximations.
In Fig. B2, we compare our derived distribution for the largest singular value, fλ1(y),
against Monte Carlo simulations of the distribution for various n values (with n = m
in each case), each with 600 trials. We can see that our approximate distribution is
quite good even for small matrix sizes and quickly improves as n becomes larger. This
follows from the asymptotic validity of Tracy-Widom scaling, which ensures that our
approximation becomes more accurate in the large n, m limit.
