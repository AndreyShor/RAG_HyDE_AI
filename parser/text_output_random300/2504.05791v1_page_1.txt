Abstract
Leveraging the integration of visual and proprioceptive cues, re-
search has uncovered various perception thresholds in VR that
can be exploited to support haptic feedback for grasping. While
previous studies have explored individual dimensions, such as size,
the combined effect of multiple geometric properties on perceptual
illusions remains poorly understood. We present a two-alternative
forced choice study investigating the perceptual interplay between
object size and taper angle. We introduce an illusion space model,
providing detailed insights into how physical and virtual object
configurations affect human perception. Our insights reveal how,
for example, as virtual sizes increase, users perceive that taper an-
gles increase, and as virtual angles decrease, users overestimate
sizes. We provide a mathematical model of the illusion space, and
an associated tool, which can be used as a guide for the design of
future VR haptic devices and for proxy object selections.

Introduction
Accurate haptic feedback remains a grand challenge of virtual re-
ality (VR). While visual and audio resolution continues toward
realism, haptics remain relatively limited. One of the opportunities
here is to leverage physical objects from the space around the user
to provide haptic feedback for virtual objects in VR. By leveraging
visuo-proprioceptive illusions, these objects do not have to be an
exact match for one another. Understanding what virtual objects a
physical object can represent remains a challenge. To date, research

has considered the impact of individual geometric properties in iso-
lation, and are yet to consider how different properties may impact
one another and our perception.
This style of illusory, nearby-object-based haptic interaction is
typically referred to as a passive haptics approach. These solutions
benefit from being just-in-time, device-free, ad-hoc, and, (concep-
tually) scalable [12, 14, 45]. At the same time, they are constrained
by perceptual illusion limits that require careful design and precise
application to not adversely impact the user experience [25].
Much of the existing literature on passive haptics has explored
object co-location (considering where the physical proxy object is,
such that it may feel as though it is in the same location as the virtual
object, e.g., through haptic retargeting [2, 12, 14, 54]), rather than
object similarity (considering what the object is, such that it may
feel like the same in material and geometry) [40]. This exploration
of co-location has revealed that objects can be approx. 15° around
an arc to the left or right of the virtual object [13] and between
0.87x and 1.31x as far from the user [19].
Explorations of similarity have provided insights into the min-
imum and maximum size the proxy can represent [6], and the
perception of separate factors including sizes, angles and curves on
the surface of the object [16]. So far, these works have considered
object properties in isolation. However, the properties’ impacts
on hand-pose, and joint forces and torques are not isolated – size
and shape together drive the finger spacing, orientations, and joint
configurations of grasping, for example. How object shapes and
sizes interplay to impact our perceptual limits remains poorly un-
derstood.
We study the illusory limits and interplay of size and taper angle
of physical proxies, using real-time, virtual remapping techniques
where users’ fingers are retargeted whilst reaching for the objects.
We produced physical hexahedron objects for grasping, with 3
widths (3 cm, 6 cm, and 9 cm) and 3 taper angles (0°, 8°, and 16°,
between the side face and the vertical direction). We conduct a
study with 40 participants, grasping the physical objects with dif-
fering virtual counterparts (6 virtual sizes × 7 virtual angles for each
physical object). By studying these object properties together, we
reveal a complex, multi-dimensional illusion space across both size
and taper angle. For example, our results show how increasing the
virtual size of an object will strongly increase the perceived angle of
that object, while increasing the virtual angle makes the perceived
size smaller. We provide a set of mathematical expressions that
describes a proxy object’s haptic capacity and reveals how size and
taper angle interplay with each other in creating illusions. We also
discuss how these results may feed into mechanical, actuated, ac-
tive haptics controller designs, to facilitate super-resolution haptic
devices.
