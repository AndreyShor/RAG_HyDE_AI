FIG. 2: Concurrence for a scalar decay to t¯t due to a
collinear emission. The LO and the scalar lines overlap
at C = 1. Line styles: LO and scalar (thick),
pseudoscalar (solid), vector (dashed), axial (dotted) and
the different interaction strengths are αΓ = 1/10 (blue),
αΓ = 1/50 (red) and αΓ = 1/137 (green).

SPLITTING FUNCTIONS AS KRAUS
OPERATORS
We now show that the Kraus operators are directly re-
lated to the Altarelli-Parisi (AP) splitting functions [62]
for q →qg. This identification connects a quantum infor-
mation formalism to a well-known particle physics one.
Following the discussion in [54, 55], let us consider
a production n-point amplitude Mn which undergoes a
splitting ˜ı →ik of particle ˜ı to an (n+1)-point amplitude
Mn+1. The factorization is given by
Mλiλk
n+1 (· · ·, pi, pk, · · ·) = Sλ˜ıλiλk
˜ı→ik
Mλ˜ı
n (· · ·, p˜ı, · · ·) , (15)
where the effective QCD splitting amplitudes Sλ˜ıλiλk
˜ı→ik
are
given by
Sλ˜ıλiλk
˜ı→ik
=

gs
pi · pk
Fλ˜ıλiλk
˜ı→ik
(z)Sτ(pi, pk) ,
(16)
where z is the fraction of particle i momentum relative
to ˜ı. The spinor product Sτ(pi, pk) depends on the az-
imuthal angle between ik plane and the spin index τ = ±.
For our purposes, the relevant splitting functions are the
q →qg ones [54, 62]

where γ = (1 −m2/z2q2)1/2. The massless case can be
obtained by simply taking the quark mass m →0 in the
previous equation. The spin density matrix is obtained
by multiplying with the complex conjugate of the am-
plitude, here simply represented by a bar. The density
matrix before the splitting for the momenta of particle
p˜ı is given by the helicity index (λi and λ′
i)
ρλ˜ıλ′
˜ı = 1
Ni
Mλ˜ı(· · ·, p˜ı, · · ·) M
λ′
˜ı(· · ·, p˜ı, · · ·) .
(18)
Similarly, we can define the density matrix after it un-
dergoes a splitting, which now contains and extra helicity
index for the outgoing radiation (λk and λ′
k)
ρ(λiλk)(λ′

In the collinear limit one can write the following relation

So far this corresponds to what is usually done when in-
cluding spin correlations in parton shower evolution [47,
48, 54, 55]. In our case, we want to model the scenario
where this collinear emission is unresolvable by the de-
tector. For that, we need to obtain the reduced density
matrix and understand the emission as decoherence ef-
fects. Tracing over the radiation degrees of freedom, we
obtain
ρλiλ′

X
σ,σ′=±
δσσ′
Z
pk
⟨pk, σ|ρ(λiλk)(λ′
iλ′
k)|pk, σ′⟩.
(21)
Here, we use a compact notation σ to indicate the sum of
the possible channels, which coincides with the helicities
(either positive or negative) of the emitted massless radi-
ation. Then, the reduced density matrix can be written
as
ρλiλ′
i

X
σ=±
Z
pk
Sλ˜ıλiσ
˜ı→ik · ρλ˜ıλ′
˜ı · Sλ′
˜ıλ′
iσ
˜ı→ik ,
(22)
where Sλ˜ıλiσ
˜ı→ik can be directly related to the Kraus opera-
tors. We can now define the collinear emission as a part
of quantum map
¯Ecol[ρ] =
X
σ=±
Z
pk
Sλ˜ıλiσ
˜ı→ik · ρλ˜ıλ′
˜ı · Sλ′
˜ıλ′

˜ı→ik .
(23)
Note that the map above acts solely on particle ˜ı, i.e., is
“local” in the particles, a well-known property of collinear
radiation.
In order to include it in the evolution of a
bipartite system as in the previous section, we just aug-
ment it with the identity 12. This structure is the same
