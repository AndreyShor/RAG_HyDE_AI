Boundary four-arm event
Proof of (1.3) in Theorem 1.1. By Lemma 4.13, it suffices to show that
P[E+
2 (ε, r)] ≍εξ+
4 (κ).
(5.5)
We explore Γ+ along the arcs ℓ1 := r exp(it) for t ∈(0, 3π/8) and ℓ2 := −r exp(−it) for t ∈(0, 3π/8),
see Figure 5.2. For i = 1, 2, we trace every loop in Γ that ℓi encounters in the counterclockwise
direction, in the order that ℓi encounters them. We stop this exploration the first time that we
reach Br/2, namely we stop at a time that we are tracing along a loop γi that intersects Br/2,
exactly at the moment that γi reaches ∂Br/2, so that we have discovered a piece bγi of γi. If none
of the loops in Γ+ intersect both ℓi and ∂Br/2, then we stop this process at the time that we have
discovered all the loops in Γ+ that intersect ℓi.
On the event Ei that there exists a loop in Γ+ which intersects both ℓi and ∂Br/2, we define γi
and bγi just as above. Let ai and bi be the endpoints of bγi (traced from ai to bi in the counterclockwise
direction). Let ti be the first time (according to the parametrization of ℓi) that ℓi intersects γi. Let
Ki be the union of bγi, ℓi((0, ti)) together with all the loops in Γ+ that ℓi((0, ti)) intersects. Let E3
be the event that E1 ∩E2 occurs. On the event E3, let H be the connected component containing
0 of H \ K1 ∪K2. Let f be the unique conformal map from H onto H with f(0) = 0, f(∞) = ∞
and f′(0) = 1.
Let Σ be the σ-algebra generated by E3, bγ1, bγ2 and by all the loops in Γ+ that ℓi((0, ti))
intersects.
Note that f and H are measurable w.r.t. Σ.
Conditionally on Σ and on E3, the
image of (γ1 ∪γ2) \ (bγ1 ∪bγ2) under f is a pair of chordal 2-SLEκ in H with the endpoints
f(b1), f(a1), f(b2), f(a2), that we denote by (eγ1, eγ2). Note that the pairing pattern of the 2-SLEκ is
not measurable w.r.t. Σ. Conditionally on Σ and on E3, the probability that f(a1) is connected to
f(b1) is given by an explicit function of the cross-ratio of the four points f(b1), f(a1), f(b2), f(a2),
which was computed in [31].
On the event E3, by Lemma 2.1, we have
Bε/4 ∩H ⊆f(Bε ∩H) ⊆B4ε ∩H.
The remainder of the proof is almost the same as that of the interior case in Section 5.1, except
that we will use Theorem 2.5, instead of Theorem 2.4. We can similarly get the upper bound
P[E+
2 (ε, r) ∩G+
2 (ε, r)] ≲εξ+
4 ,
which then implies (5.5) by Lemma 4.12. This completes the proof.
