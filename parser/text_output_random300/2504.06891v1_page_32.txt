Supplementary Figure 7: Effects of the equation of state, mixing parametrization and nuclear
reaction rates on the seismic opacity proﬁles.
equation of state’s impact on the ﬁnal opacity determination, we use different tables available in
CLES. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 7, the impact is minimal, mainly because the variations
in the determined temperature in the solar interior’s radiative layers are very small for various
equations of state. This does not diminish the equation of state’s overall importance in solar
models and helioseismic inversions, as demonstrated in various studies103;104;62;105. Rather, it
highlights the current tables’ high consistency, providing nearly identical temperatures for a
given set of thermodynamic variables in the radiative layers.
Similarly, we test in Supplementary Fig. 8 the impact of using different opacity tables in the
evolutionary models. We see that, despite starting from very different initial tables, the recon-
struction procedure provides essentially the same seismic opacity proﬁle, with again a discrep-
ancy at the BCZ seen for every table.
