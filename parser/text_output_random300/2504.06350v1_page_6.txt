attempt by Eve to intercept and replicate the qubits would be futile without introducing detectable
errors. Additionally, if Eve measures a qubit without knowing the correct basis, (only Alice knows x),
the original information encoded in the other basis is irreversibly lost due to the uncertainty principle.
Consequently, any eavesdropping attempt increases the QBER alerting Alice and Bob. Specifically, after
comparing m = |{ci|ci = 1∨ci = 0}i| bits, the probability that Eve can eavesdrop without being detected
drops to (3/4)m as 50% chance that Eve guesses correctly (same Alice’s color in Fig. 1) no matter Bob’s
choice plus 50% chance that Eve guesses wrongly, and within that 50%, there’s another 50% chance that
Bob’s measurement will yield an incorrect result (Alice’s color differs from Eve and Bob’s color in Fig.
1). The theoretical security proofs depend on Eve’s ability to perform (i) individual attacks, measuring
states separately; (ii) collective attacks, measuring individually with joint classical post-processing; (iii)
coherent attacks, using joint quantum measurements on all states stored in a memory.
1.3.2. Implementation issues and Quantum Hacking
As is traditionally advertised in regards to QKD, any attempt by Eve to uncover information of the
key results in an increase in the QBER. A simple and straightforward example are Intercept-and-Resend
Attacks, where Eve intercepts ψQi sent by Alice, measures it in a chosen basis, prepares a new photon
state based on her measurement result and sends it to Bob [27–29]. Since she chooses the wrong basis
some of the time, her disturbance increases the QBER and is thus detectable. Evaluation of the QBER
can give an upper bound for the amount of information Eve has about the key. Thus, QKD can be
theoretically secure. However, even in a noise-free scenario, the difference between theory and practice
can result in vulnerabilities. Indeed, if ψQi ∈H with uncontrolled dim H and no Bell Inequality (BI)
violation is measured, QKD is insecure, because the same BB84 correlations ( p(ai = bi|xi = yi) = 1
and p(ai ̸= bi|xi ̸= yi) = 1/2) produced by |ψ⟩= (|00⟩+ |11⟩)/
√
2 ∈C2 ⊗C2 are also reproduced by a
four-qubit separable state [30], ( [31] in app. A),
ρ = 1
4 (|00⟩⟨00| + |11⟩⟨11|) ⊗(|++⟩⟨++| + |−−⟩⟨−−|) ,
when Alice measures the first (third) qubit in the σz (σx) basis, and Bob measures the second (fourth)
qubit in the σz (σx) basis. As there is no quantum correlation, a secure key cannot be established.
While this type of quantum state manipulation might seem to give too much power to Eve, it is
indeed true that operational imperfections present considerable opportunities for hacking [32, 33]. For
example, Eve can exploit the fact that weak coherent pulses (WPCs), used in some QKD systems, can
contain more than one photon to implement the Photon Number Splitting (PNS) attack. By separating
and storing one of the photons from a WCP, Eve can measure it later, once the measurement basis has
been publicly announced. In this way, she can obtain full information without disturbing the state of
the photons sent to Bob [34–36]. Other examples incude side-channel [37–40], trojan horse [41, 42], and
device calibration [43, 12, 44–47] attacks (a full list in [18]). To effectively counter these vulnerabilities,
the best approach is to use security proofs based on minimal principles and strategies that reduce or
eliminate reliance on trusted components. Among these, DI-QKD stands out as the ultimate solution.
1.4. Overview of Device-independent QKD
The internal workings and security of the quantum devices involved in QKD protocols, as we analyzed,
are often faulty and vulnerable to quantum hacking. DI-QKD represents a significant advance in that it
aims to ensure the utmost security of QKD, irrespective of the reliability or trustworthiness of the devices
used. This security is achieved through nonlocal correlations verified by the BI violation, as depicted in
Fig. 2. In general, the correlations, or behaviours are indicated as points p = {p(ab|xy)}a,b,x,y in the
convex correlation space characterized by the regions L ⊂Q ⊂NS respectively for local and realistic,
quantum, and no-signalling behaviours, respectively.
A BI violation (p ̸∈L), classified as “strongly
nonclassical” [48], implies one of two possibilities, or both: (1) a and b are determined only when
observed; (2) a nonlocal influence ensures that the key is established solely through interactions between
the trusted parties. In either case, Eve cannot access the information without being detected because
any interference would deviate from the expected nonlocal correlations.
Fig. 3 shows the evolution of DI-QKD, from BB84 and E91 protocol [50] up to the formalization
of theoretical techniques and the first implementations in 2022 [51–53] (details in Fig. 4). Remarkably,
the first successful implementation of DI-QKD was reached after overcoming all the Bell test loopholes,
highlighting the challenges in realizing DI-QKD and its connecting with BI experiments. Fig. 4 compares
the current experimental reach of DI-QKD - specifically, the distances of 2 m, approximately 200 m, and
