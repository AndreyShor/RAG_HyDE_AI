TABLE I. The first two columns list all ten platycosms Mα with α = 0, . . . , 9. The orientability of Mα is shown in the third
column, where ‘Y ’ and ‘N’ refer to orientable and non-orientable, respectively. The fourth column lists the corresponding
Bieberbach groups Bα. The following two columns exhibit their crystal classes and momentum space fractional translations,
respectively. The second cohomology groups H2(Mα, Z) are listed in the seventh column. The real-space symmorphic groups
Sα and their projective symmetry algebraic relations for realizing the momentum-space Bieberbach groups are presented in the
eighth and nine columns, respectively.
semimetals satisfy a generalized Nielsen-Ninomiya theo-
rem [30], i.e., the total chirality number over each non-
orientable Brillouin platycosm can be any even integer.
The aforementioned models are able to exhibit all possi-
ble topological phases.
Realization of Brillouin platycosms To realize each
Brillouin platyacosm Mα as a momentum-space unit, we
just need to realize the corresponding Bieberbach group
Bα in momentum space. This is done by identifying the
pair (Sα, να) for each momentum-space Bα. Here, Sα
is the corresponding real-space symmorphic group and
να the associated multiplier. The projective representa-
tions of Sα with the multiplier να can give rise to the
momentum-space Bieberbach group Bα.
The general method for realizing any momentum-space
space groups has been invented in Ref. [19]. Here, we
apply the method for the Bieberbach groups Bα. Each
Bieberbach group Bα belongs to an arithmetic crystal
class cα
F , which specifies the lattice Lα
F or the primi-
tive lattice translations for the translation subgroup, the
point group P α, and how the point group acts on the lat-
tice Lα
F . Here, the subscript F indicates that the quan-
tities are defined in momentum space. Accordingly, Lα
F
is the reciprocal lattice or the collection of all recipro-
cal translations.
The corresponding real-space crystal-
lographic group Sα must belong to the arithmetic crys-
tal class cα dual to cα
F , i.e., the lattice Lα of Sα is re-
lated to Lα
F by the Fourier transform, while the point
group P α is the same subgroup of O(3).
Explicitly,
let ei and Gi be the primitive lattice translations for
Lα and Lα
F , respectively, with i = 1, 2, 3.
Then, the
two sets of primitive lattice translations are related by
ei = 1
2ϵijkGj × Gk/|G1 · (G2 × G3)|. Since Sα is sym-
morphic, the arithmetic class cα completely determines
Sα. For all ten Bieberbach groups Bα, we have tabulated
their corresponding real-space symmorphic groups Sα in
Tab. I.
In a projective representation ρα of Sα with multiplier
να, the group multiplication is modified to
ρ(g1)ρ(g2) = να(g1, g2)ρ(g1g2).
(3)
According to Ref. [19], the multiplier να, which can lead
to the momentum-space crystallographic group Bα, is de-
termined by the fractional reciprocal lattice translations
through
να[(t1, R1), (t2, R2)] = e−2πiκR1·t2.
(4)
Here, each g ∈Sα is denoted as (t, R) with t ∈Lα
and R in the point group P α. κR denotes the fractional
reciprocal lattice translation associated with R ∈P, i.e.,
R acts in momentum space as
R : k 7→Rk + κR.
(5)
It is significant to notice that six among the nine non-
trivial platycosms involve only half primitive translations
and therefore the multipliers are valued in Z2 = {±1}.
Consequently, Z2 gauge fluxes are sufficient to realize all
