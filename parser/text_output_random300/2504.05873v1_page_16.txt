illustrative, as the actual integration over x weighs dσ/dx with the exponential functions
given at the end of eq. (3.6). However, it is clear that while the Primakoff production of
leptophilic ALPs occurs only via an effective loop coupling, it can still have an impact on
constraints that can be set on the ALP mass and couplings.
Finally, there are still the contributions arising from secondary positrons created in the
shower. Both the DB and Primakoff processes give exactly the same contributions when the
electron line in the Feynman diagrams is replaced with a positron line. The only difference
between the contributions are the electron and positron energy distribution functions Ie,p.
This means that instead of considering the electron and positron production processes
separately, we summarise them together by using the total electron-positron distribution
function

For muonphilic ALPs, there can also be ALP bremsstrahlung from secondary muons
produced in the electromagnetic shower [74]. Comparing our results to the ones in ref. [74],
we find that the loop-induced Primakoff process dominates ALP production for muonphilic
ALPs. Therefore, we do not include the contributions of secondary muons in the present
work.

Annihilation Processes
In addition to the contributions from DB and Primakoff production, we also consider ALP
production from processes in which a positron created in a secondary shower annihilates
with an electron inside the beam dump. Since only positrons from the shower contribute
to these processes, the first important change compared to DB and Primakoff production
is that the integrated energy distribution appearing in eq. (3.6) only contains the contri-
butions from positrons, i.e.
Iint(E0, E, T) =
Z T
0
dt I(2)
p (E0, E, t) .

If the annihilation of the positron and electron has a centre-of-mass energy that is
exactly √s = ma, an ALP can be produced resonantly:
e−(p1) + e+(p2) →a(k) .
