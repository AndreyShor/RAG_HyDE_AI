determined using this manual tracking and then compared to automated edge detection 
outputs (Figure 3) to verify correct output. The automated edge detection software assumes a 
3-dimension rotation of the 2-dimension image to determine volume; thus, assuming a 
rotationally symmetric crater shape, consistent with previous data processing from Metzger 
(2010). Using this technique, crater depth and volume were plotted as a function of time using 
5-ÔÅ≥ data clipping in Python to remove any outlying points from airborne dust, which caused 
small time history gaps in Figure 3b. The volumetric erosion rate was then calculated by linear 
fitting of these clipped time histories for each run under steady-state conditions, between 4 
and 6 seconds into the run as shown in Figure 3b.

3.0 RESULTS 
3.1 Plume Characterization 
 
Pitot tube measurements of normal (downward) velocity, recorded in different planes 
below the nozzle exit inside the empty regolith bin are shown in Figure 4 for an upstream 
chamber pressure of 551 kPa and mass flow rate of 129 standard liters per minute (slpm). In 
Figure 4, the exit nozzle of the 1.0 cm pipe is centered at 0 cm in both the X and Y positions, as 
shown. These measurements reveal that the gas velocity maintains a sub-sonic, collimated 
profile between 5,000-5,500 cm/s directly under the exit nozzle to a depth of roughly 2.0 cm, 
before slowly expanding radially outwards. Moreover, a downward, normal velocity on the 
order of 5,000 cm/s was observed at 7.5 cm below the exit.
