path i = 1, a fixed measurement Nλ is performed on Alice’s system, yielding a classical outcome λ
with the probability distribution p(a|x, λ), and transmit it to A1.
• Fully quantum marginal correlations: denoted as Mqq, the fully quantum marginal correlations
are where the source prepares on Alice’s side a pair of systems A = (A0, A1) and if i = 0 (i = 1) the
relay routs the first subsystem to the device A0 (A1). The resulting correlations can be encompassed
to the bipartite marginals of qqq-correlations
p(a0, a1, b|x0, x1, y) = Tr[ρA0A1BMa|x,0 ⊗Ma|x,1 ⊗Mb|y].
(79)
• Quantum-classical marginal correlations: denoted as Mqc, the quantum-classical marginal
correlations can be obtained by further restricting the state ρA0A1B to be a qqc-state as
ρA0A1B =
X
λ
p(λ)ρA0B ⊗|λ⟩⟨λ|A1 .
(80)
All the above correlations can be written as
p(a, b, i) = Tr[ρMa|xiMb|y],
(81)
where Ma|xi and Mb|y are projectors that satisfy the following commutation relations for each subset
[Ma|xi, Mb|y] = 0,
if p ∈Q,
(82)
[Ma|xi, Mb|y] = 0,
[Ma|x1, Ma′|x′1] = 0,
if p ∈QSR,
(83)
[Ma|xi, Mb|y] = 0,
[Ma|x0, Ma′|x′1] = 0,
if p ∈Mqq,
(84)
[Ma|xi, Mb|y] = 0,
[Ma|x0, Ma′|x′1] = 0,
[Ma|x1, Ma′|x′1] = 0,
if p ∈Mqc.
(85)
which follows from the fact that each of the tensor products between subsystems in definition 15 can be
replaced by commutation relations.
As a result, the above representation fits in the framework of non-commutative polynomial optimization,
which means that the sets defined in 15 can be outer-approximated through SDP hierarchies.
Trade-off relations between S0 and S1. Let us consider a realistic CHSH scenario in which the source and
measurement devices are imperfect. Considering the situation described in fig. 9, when i = 0 Alice places
her measurement device A0 close to the source achieving an effective detection efficiencies, ηA0, whereas
when i = 1, she places her device A1, further away from the source, therefore ηA1 ≤ηA0. Similarly, for
effective visibilities vA1 ≤vA0, which result in the following quantum state shared between (Ai, B)
ρ(vi) = vAivB |ψ⟩⟨ψ| + vAi(1 −vB)(ρB ⊗I
2 ) + (1 −vAi)vB(I
2 ⊗ρA) + (1 −vAi)(1 −vB)I4
4 ,
(86)
where ρA(B) = TrB(A)(|ψ⟩⟨ψ|). Treating i ∈{0, 1} as an additional Alice’s input, denoting the location
of her measurement device, the CHSH value is also dependent on i, which we denote by Si. The following
theorem captures the tradeoffs between S0 and S1 [247]
Theorem 4. If a loophole-free nonlocal correlation between (A0, B) is witnessed S0 > 2, then loophole-free
nonlocal correlations between (A1, B) can be certified whenever the following inequality is violated
S1 ≤

0.

Proof. The short range correlations that were considered in [247] are represented as
p(a, b|x, y, i) =
(P
λ p(λ)Tr[ρλ
A0BMa|x0 ⊗Mb|y]
if i = 0,
P
λ p(λ)p(a|x, λ)p(b|y, λ)
if i = 1.
(88)
The intuition for the proof is as follows: for simplicity consider the case where S0 = 2
√
2. Then, by
standard self-testing result 2.3, it can be inferred that the measurement {Bb|x} corresponds to a Pauli
measurement on a two-dimensional subspace of B that is maximally entangled with A0. In particular,
the Bob’s measurement outcomes must be fully random and uncorrelated with the classical instructions
λ shared with B which result in p(b|y, λ) = p(b|y) =
1
2 for all λ’s which gives S1 = 0 Although the
assumption that S0 = 2
√
2 is too strong, for any value S0 > 2 there is a bound on how much the outcomes
of POVM {Bb|y} can be correlated to other systems besides. Particularly p(b|x, λ) ≤1

all λ [59], which result in the bound (87).
