Hadronic molecules and multiquark states
While there is no evidence in the data yet for the three highlying states, they have to exist, if the pentaquarks observed are indeed of
molecular nature. In addition, all the different states need to prominently decay into the channels that form the molecular states (that is Σc ¯D
for the Pc¯c(4312)). The pertinent predictions are provided in Ref. [200]. The relevant data are expected to be published in the coming years.
5 All heavy tetraquarks
While most of the experimental information is available for hadrons containing two heavy constituents, the LHCb measurements of di-J/ψ
production in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass (c.m.) energies 7, 8 and 13 TeV revealed a new, potentially rich class of exotic states
with four charmed (anti-)quarks [201]. In fact, the measured line shape has a non-trivial shape that deviates significantly from the phase
space distribution as well as from the exponential behaviour predicted from perturbative QCD for single- and double-parton scattering. The
attention of both the experimental and theoretical communities was mainly drawn to the statistically significant peak structures observed
in the energy range from 6.5 GeV to about 7.2 GeV. In particular, the most prominent structure was named Tcc¯c¯c(6900) (also known as
X(6900)) [202]. A fully-charmed compact tetraquark resonance is the most natural candidate to explain the structure. However, most of the
theoretical studies give cc¯c¯c ground states at a mass significantly lower than 6.9 GeV [203–212]. Thus, one expects lower states, if there
is a cc¯c¯c resonance with a mass around 6.9 GeV. Due to a smaller phase space, such lighter states are expected to have smaller widths.
However, there are no obvious narrower peaks in the reported double-J/ψp spectrum.
When the data are analysed using a coupled-channel scattering formalism with vector charmonium pairs [213], the number and locations
of the poles in the 6900 MeV mass region appear to be rather poorly determined and strongly dependent on the model ingredients. Never-
theless, if this approach does indeed capture the relevant dynamics, the data suggest the existence of a pole near the di-J/ψ threshold in the
double-J/ψ production amplitude. This state was named X(6200) (or Tcc¯c¯c(6200) according to the new naming scheme for exotic particles
promoted by the Particle Data Group [202]). This finding was confirmed by the calculation in Ref. [214] and more recently in Ref. [215].
Due to the suppression of the signal near the threshold caused by the phase space factor, this pole cannot show up as a pronounced peak
structure above the threshold in the double J/ψ line shape. Instead, it can only be unambiguously identified by a comprehensive pole search
in the coupled-channel scattering amplitudes. Meanwhile, a steep rise of the line shape just above the threshold provides evidence for the
existence of such a near-threshold pole [190]. As can be seen from the analysis in Ref. [213], the behaviour of the signal just above the
di-J/ψ threshold does indeed call for the existence of the X(6200) pole.
Recently, data on the double J/ψ production in pp collisions have also arrived from two other LHC collaborations, namely CMS [216]
and ATLAS [217]. Remarkably, in both cases the data description improved after the inclusion of an auxiliary Breit-Wigner resonance
centred just above the production threshold. The need for its inclusion in the fitting function supports the existence of the X(6200) pole in
the amplitude [218].
6 Single heavy tetraquarks
Since their discovery in 2003 the lightest open charm positive parity states containing strangeness remained largely a mystery—especially
in light of the seemingly expected properties of their non-strange partner states. In the past, attempts were made to explain the low lying Ds
states like c¯s mesons [219–223], chiral partners of the ground state Ds and D∗
s mesons [224, 225], compact [cq][¯s¯q] tetraquark states [26],
mixing of the c¯s and tetraquarks [226], a Dπ atom for the D∗
s0(2317) [227], and D(∗)K hadronic molecules [228–233]. The experimental
data show three features that need to be understood:
(1)
The Ds states are too light: Both, D∗
s0(2317) and Ds1(2460) are much lighter than the quark model expectations for the lowest scalar
and axial-vector c¯s.
(2)
Fine-tuning: One has MDs1(2460) −MD∗
s0(2317) ≃MD∗± −MD± within 2 MeV.
(3)
Mass hierarchy: One finds MD∗
0(2300) ∼MD∗
s0(2317) and MD1(2430) ∼MDs1(2460), although usually adding a strange quark leads to an increase
in mass of about 150-200 MeV.
Items (1) and (2) could be understood in a compact tetraquark picture [234], however, leaving the third one unexplained. On the other hand,
all these find a simultaneous natural explanation, if the lowest positive-parity charmed mesons are interpreted as hadronic molecules. In
this case the flavor structure of this family of states is governed by the one that emerges from the flavor decomposition representing the
scattering of Goldstone bosons off D mesons, which may be expressed as [235]
[¯3] ⊗[8] = [¯3] ⊕[6] ⊕[15] ,
(26)
where the multiplets on the left refer to the D mesons and the light pseudoscalars, respectively. Note that we do not include scattering
of the ninth pseudoscalar, the η′, here, since due to the action of the U(1)A anomaly it cannot be regarded as a Goldstone boson. Non-
strange isospin 1/2 multiplets appear in all three irreducible representations, however, chiral symmetry constraints dictate that only the [¯3]
and the [6] are attractive [235]. In particular, in this case the D∗
0(2300) is interpreted as emerging from the interplay of two poles, one at
2105 MeV and one at 2451 MeV, with the lower one being a member of the same SU(3) multiplet as the D∗
s0(2317), the [¯3], where the
attraction is the strongest. The state at 2451 MeV is a member of the [6] representation of SU(3), where the interaction is weaker than in
the [¯3], but still sufficiently strong to generate a pole at physical quark masses sufficiently close to the physical axis to show an impact on
observables [231, 236–238]. It should be stressed that two-pole structures are occurring in various systems, since the compared to the naive
quark model enlarged multiplet structure alluded to in Eq. (26) appears analogously in various systems. For a recent review see Ref. [239].
