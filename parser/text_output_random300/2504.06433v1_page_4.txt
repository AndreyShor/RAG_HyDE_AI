Preliminaries
Let n ∈N. We deﬁne [n] = {1, . . . , n} and for s = s1s2 · · · sn ∈{0, 1}n, we let wt(s) denote the
Hamming weight of s, and ⊕s ∈{0, 1} the parity of s.
wt(s) =
n
X
k=1
si
⊕s = wt(s) mod 2
In a slight abuse of notation, we use s also to denote the natural number in [0, 1, . . . , 2n −1]
represented by s in binary. (The correct interpretation will be clear from the context.) The binary
string of length n of all 1’s is denoted by 1n. If the length is clear from the context, we sometimes
write just 1.
Notation 2.1. Let n = n1 + n2.
For binary strings s1 ∈{0, 1}n1 and s2 ∈{0, 1}n2, we let
s = s1 ◦s2 ∈{0, 1}n be the concatenation of s1 with s2.

Algebraic Preliminaries
For a ﬁeld F and variables x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn), let F[x] denote the ring of n-variate polynomials
over F. For f ∈F[x], an assigment a = (a1, a2 . . . , an) ∈Fn, and a subset I ⊆[n], we deﬁne f|xI=a
as the polynomial obtained from f by substituting ai for xi, for each i ∈I. Hence, f|xI=a is a
polynomial in variables xj, for j ∈I = [n] \ I.
We say that f ∈F[x] depends on variable xi, if there exists a ∈Fn such that f|x[n]\{i}=a is
non-constant. Note that f|x[n]\{i}=a is univariate in variable xi. All variables that f depends on
are denoted as var(f),
var(f) = { i ∈[n] | f depends on xi } .
An assignment a ∈Fn that witnesses that f depends on all variables in var(f) simultaneously is
called a justifying assignment for f.
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Justifying assignment). For f ∈F[x], a justifying assignment for f is an a ∈Fn
such that fx[n]\{i}=a depends on xi, for all i ∈var(f).
For ﬁxed f ∈F[x], justifying assignments are known to exist provided F is big enough [SV10],
in particular in inﬁnite ﬁelds.
Deﬁnition 2.3. A polynomial f ∈F[x] is decomposable if there exist nonconstant polynomials g, h
over disjoint sets of variables such that f = gh. Otherwise f is indecomposable.
Every polynomial f ∈F[x] factors uniquely (up to order and multiplication by nonzero elements
of F) into indecomposable factors over pairwise disjoint sets of variables. Since the factorization
of a polynomial is unique (up to the order of the factors), the same holds for the decomposition.
Irreducibility implies indecomposability. The reverse implication holds for multilinear4 polynomials.
Univariate polynomials are always indecomposable.
A decomposition of f ∈F[x] induces a variable-partition of var(f) by the factors, where the sets
correspond to the variables occurring in the indecomposable factors of f. Note that the partition
is unique. By convention, we extend this partition to a partition of [n] by letting {i} be an element
of the partition for all i ∈[n] \ var(f).
4By “multilinear” we mean that each variable has degree at most 1.
