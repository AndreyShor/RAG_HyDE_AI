Ωis assumed here as a typical angular velocity in the radiative zone (ﬁxed to the helioseismic
value), η is the magnetic diffusivity. Introducing this criterion in Eq. 3, assuming equality in Eq.
4 (i.e. that the value of the shear is kept just at the critical level for the instability to operate),
and averaging over latitude, one can derive the following expression
DX,1 = Dh f (r)Ω−3/2

where f(r) is an appropriate weight function used to reproduce the more complex behaviour of
the mixing coefﬁcient. The magnetic diffusivity is approximated considering solar material as

with Λ = −12.7 + log T −0.5 log ρ, the ratio of the Debye length to the impact parameter in the
plasma of electron concentration, assuming cgs units.
The coefﬁcient represents the interaction of meridional circulation, shear-induced turbulence,
and the Tayler-Spruit instability. Both f (r) and Ωare adapted for the solar case to replicate re-
sults from models with full magneto-hydrodynamical treatment of rotation in the Geneva stellar
evolution code78. Dh serves as a free parameter for calibrating transport efﬁciency, representing
the value attributed to horizontal shear-induced turbulence.
Another common approach is to implement a simple coefﬁcient depending only on the local
density, following73
