Separating the real and the imaginary part signifies that the static field contributes to both the 
absorptive and the dispersive part of the signal.

Hence one would expect the change in the spectral line shape controlled by the Debye length as 
well as the phase mismatch. The phase angle of this process is given by ϕ = arctan(∆kz ) 
Thus previous studies18,52,54 already show total second harmonic signal is going to be the 
contribution from the χ(2) as well as χ(3) part due to the contribution of ionic potentials as well 
the phase contribution as given by equation 7).

Results and Discussions 
 
Fig 1 c) presents the quantitative variation of the Surface potential and the inverse Debye length 
with the change of ionic strength of the solution. 
Fig 1. d) shows the variation of phase ϕ as a function of both ionic strength and the phase 
mismatch. This reflects that phase change can be employed as a significant parameter to understand 
the interface. 
As the advanced two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES)36–40 employs phase re- 
solved heterodyne techniques having control over the phase information we consider this proce- 
dure to understand the interface of nano/microparticles. Fig 2 a) shows the schematic of the pulse 
sequences for heterodyne detected four-wave mixing, where the signal is collected in rephasing 
phase-matched direction interfering with a local oscillator(LO).55 
The 3rd-order nonlinear polarization of an isotropic system is given as the time evolution of 
the density matrix by the third-order perturbation of three laser fields resulting in the four-wave
