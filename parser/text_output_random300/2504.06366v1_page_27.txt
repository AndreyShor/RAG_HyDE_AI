Figure S7. Time evolution of OHUE from historical runs and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 
2-4.5 (SSP245). The results represent ensemble mean from individual models. Similar to Figure 
1a, the x-axis shows the centered year of the 20-year sliding window. The ensemble size used 
is determined by the ensemble size of the corresponding SSP245 runs, which are shown in the 
square brackets.
