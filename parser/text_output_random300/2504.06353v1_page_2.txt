Introduction
Jet vetoes are an important class of jet-based observable that can be used to cut away
background events and separate different hard scattering processes that produce differ-
ing numbers of hadronic jets. Often, ‘tight’ cuts, where the jet veto scale T cut is much
smaller than the hard scale Q, are required to efficiently remove background processes. In
these circumstances large logarithms of Q/T cut appear in the perturbative series for the
observable, that need to be summed to all orders to obtain a reliable prediction [1, 2].
The most commonly used jet veto variable is the transverse momentum of the leading
jet (see refs. [3–13] for theoretical calculations for this observable in the context of various
processes). Although this is a very useful observable, it is uniform in (pseudo)rapidity
space. In experiments, it can be difficult to disentangle low pTj pile up jets from those
from the primary process at high rapidity, due to missing tracking information. Thus, one
may want, or need, to use an observable where the cut on pTj is looser at higher rapidities.
One option is to simply switch to a looser cut beyond some particular pseudorapidity value;
the structure of theoretical predictions for such step-like vetoes is discussed in ref. [14]. An
