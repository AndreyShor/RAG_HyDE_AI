Figure 6. Case 3: Pair of Characteristically near stable and
unstable vector fields
Stable vector fields characteristically non-close to unstable vector fields are repre-
sented in Case 3 in Fig. 6. The vector fields in Example 9 have underlying systems
that have the potential to be modulated to obtain a pair of charactistically close
stable systems, since
||0.67| −|1.36|| = 0.69 ∈[0, 1] (satisfies Theorem 2).
That is, even though the vector field
⃗V ffr68 is unstable in Case 3, it is charac-
teristically close to the stable vector field
⃗V ffr51
in Fig. 6. That characteristic
closeness suggests the possibility of modulating the waveform slightly to change the
vector field ⃗V ffr68 from unstable to unstable.
Unlike the temporal proximities of systems in the study in [7], the characteristi-
cally close systems in Fig. 6 are is different frames within the same video, but are
separated by 10 frames and, hence, are not temporally close. The form of charac-
teristic closeness introduced in this paper corroborates the results in [9]. Cases 1
and 2 illustrate the result in Theorem 5, namely, characteristically close systems
are proximal.
