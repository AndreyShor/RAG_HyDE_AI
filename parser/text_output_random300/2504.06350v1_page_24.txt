Two-way classical postprocessing. – In two-way postprocessing, no optimal procedure or tight bound
analogous to Eq. (50) is known. The most common method, Advantage Distillation (AD) [223, 224], say
that
∃˜B, ˜E s.t. I(A : B) < I(B : E)
AD
=⇒I( ˜A : ˜B) > I( ˜B : ˜E)
(54)
enabling one-way postprocessing on ˜B, ˜E. In AD, Alice publicly reveals N instances where her bits
are equal, i.e., ai1 = ai2 = · · · = aiN = a. Bob checks his corresponding bits and announces whether all
his bits are also equal. If Bob’s bits are all equal, Alice and Bob keep one of these instances, (aik, bik)
otherwise, they discard the N instances. The error rate between Alice and Bob after this process denoted
as ˜eAB, becomes exponentially smaller: ˜eAB = eN
AB/[(1 −eAB)N + eN
AB], where eAB is the initial error
rate between Alice and Bob. As N →∞, ˜eAB →0, meaning that Alice and Bob almost always share
identical bits after a sufficiently large number of instances. The probability that Eve makes an error on
Bob’s symbols after AD is approximated by ˜eE ≳C[f(eAB)]N, where f(·) is a function that depends
on the probability distribution and C is a constant. As long as the condition f(eAB) > eAB/(1 −eAB),
is satisfied, Eve’s error increases exponentially with N. There is always a finite value of N such that
Eve’s error becomes greater than Bob’s, ensuring that a secret key can be extracted. The bound on
the tolerable error after AD is derived by solving this inequality and provides the necessary condition
for secrecy extraction. Without preprocessing pNL ≳0.2; with preprocessing (allowing Alice and Bob
to flip some bit before AD) pNL ≳0.09. It remains an open question if in two-way postprocessing, a
Bell limit can be reached. Although one might consider that a two ways communication would increase
interceptions, overall AD is more noise tolerant (lower pNL) than one-way post-processing, by iteratively
improving correlations and discarding mismatched rounds to reduce error rates. Preprocessing enhances
this by scrambling Eve’s knowledge before AD.
Intrinsic information. Given a tripartite probability distribution p3 with entries p(abe), the intrinsic
information I↓= I(A : B ↓E) = minE→¯
E I(A : B| ¯E) ≥r [225]. This upper bound represents the
mutual information between Alice and Bob conditioned on Eve’s knowledge. I↓< 0 =⇒r = 0 witness
the impossibility of secret correlations in p3. The vice-versa is unknown. Furthermore, ∃p3 with a I↓> 0
but r = 0, indicating the presence of bound information (similarly to bound entanglement). While bound
information has been proven in multipartite settings, its existence in bipartite scenarios remains unknown.
For the CHSH protocol, I(A : B|E) = pNL when Alice and Bob are perfectly correlated. In other cases,
they are uncorrelated. A conjectured optimal map for minimizing this conditioned mutual information
is introduced, supported by numerical evidence giving
I↓= (1 −pL/2)(1 −h(pL/(4 −2pl))).
(55)
This conjectured intrinsic information remains positive for pNL > 0, which leads to two possibilities: (i)
r > 0 ∀p3 /∈L (ii) In the Bell limit (pNL ≃0) p3 might represent bipartite bound information.
CHSH protocol admits larger-dimensional outcomes generalization using CGLMP inequalities with
more extractable secrecy as the outcomes increase (see Ref. [56] sec.IV) or via CHAIN BI (Sec. 3.5).
The former is a tight family of BI, while CHAIN BI, though not tight, can be efficiently implemented
in the next protocol of Sec. 3.5. Before we comment Eve’s attack confined within quantum theory.
