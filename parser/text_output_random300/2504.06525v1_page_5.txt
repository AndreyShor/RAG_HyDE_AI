below (repulsive mode) the free phase angles, ℎ𝑚𝑖𝑛 is the lowest probe position of 𝑖𝑡ℎ trace and 
retrace height lines while ℎ𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 𝑚𝑖𝑛 is the global lowest probe position computed based on all 
the acquired scan lines, 𝑃(ℎ𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒 , ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒) is Pearson correlation between ℎ𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒 and ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒 to 
quantify the similarity between them. All the components inside log operator are capped 
minimally to the logarithmic constant e. 
Building on these considerations, we define three rewards to quantify these characteristics 
based on real-time scanning data. Reward 1 (height difference) measures the agreement between 
the trace and retrace lines, computed as the normalized absolute difference between them. Reward 
2 (distance) quantifies probe-sample proximity using the absolute height of the probe. Reward 3 
(phase) detects the transition between attractive and repulsive scanning modes, calculated as the 
fraction of time the phase remains above the free-air phase. Reward 4 is a different way of 
quantifying the agreement between trace and retrace and we will use MOBO to evaluate which of 
the reward 1 and 4 is better at distinguishing good scans from bad ones. 
Each of these rewards plays a distinct role in optimizing TM scans. The distance reward 
encourages the probe to remain close to the sample surface rather than oscillating in free space. 
The height difference reward further refines this proximity by ensuring that the probe closely 
follows the surface topography. Meanwhile, the phase reward prevents excessive probe-sample 
contact that could push the system into the repulsive mode. Consequently, the height difference 
reward favors a combination of high drive amplitude and low setpoint, as illustrated in Figure 1a. 
The distance reward assigns higher values to configurations with a low setpoint, as shown in Figure 
1b. In contrast, the phase reward promotes lower drive amplitudes and higher setpoints, as depicted 
in Figure 1c. 
As a result, the height difference and distance rewards are expected to share an overlapping 
optimal solution, leading to a trivial Pareto point (Figure 1e). However, the phase reward competes 
with both the height difference and distance rewards, necessitating trade-offs among them, as 
demonstrated in Figure 1f-g. 
 
Parameter space – Drive amplitude, Setpoint amplitude, and I Gain. 
Here we choose the drive amplitude, setpoint amplitude, and integral (I) gain as the controlling 
parameters to optimize. The range of drive amplitude is chosen according to the safe-seeding 
routine to be 0 to 100 nm as shown in Figure 2, with setpoint ranging from 0.1 % to 90 % of the 
free-air amplitudes. I gain in the PI loop extents from 30 to 200, chosen according to human 
heuristic about the SPM system used in this work.
