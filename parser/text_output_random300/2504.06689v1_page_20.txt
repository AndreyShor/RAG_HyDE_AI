approximations [527–530]. The transverse momentum spectrum has also been studied at NLO
+ NNLL in the case a jet veto, pj
t ≪pj,v
t , is applied [531,532]. The leading EW effects for the qg
and q¯q channels were computed some time ago [533,534] and amplitudes for the leading mixed
QCD-EW corrections are known [535–538]. The b¯b →H + j process is known differentially at
NNLOQCD [539], H + c is known at NLOQCD [540].
Efforts to compute H + j production at N3LOHTL are ongoing, with results for many of
the relevant Feynman integrals (including all required for the leading colour approximation) now
known [541, 542]. In Ref. [543], the two-loop (NNLOHTL) helicity amplitudes amplitudes were
presented to higher orders in the dimensional regulator, this is an ingredient required for the
N3LOQCD corrections. Electroweak corrections involving the trilinear Higgs self-coupling are
also now available fully differentially, including the exact quark mass dependence [544].
In Ref. [545], Higgs plus jet production was studied in the small quark mass limit, namely

H. Using the leading logarithmic approximation, a NNLOQCD prediction for
the bottom-quark correction was presented. This work provides an ingredient for understanding
the quark mass renormalisation uncertainty at the LHC. The O(y0
b) bottom mass corrections in
the kinematic region qT ∼mb ≪mH were computed in Ref. [546]. In the high-energy regime,
LL-accurate results matched to NLOQCD fixed-order results were presented in Refs [547], with
the resummed results producing a harder transverse momentum spectrum compared to the fixed-
order ones. These calculations were made public through the HEJ-2.2 code [548]. In Ref. [549],
a jet-veto resummation was performed at NNLO + aNNLL ′ for exclusive H + 1 jet production.
This provides an important input for the STXS in the regime pcut

The impact of anomalous Higgs couplings is now known at NLOQCD retaining the quark
mass effects [550], which are relevant at high Higgs pT .
The current experimental uncertainty on the Higgs + ≥1 jet differential cross section
is of the order of 10 −15%, dominated by the statistical error, for example the fit statistical
errors for the case of the combined H →γγ and H →4ℓanalyses [532,551]. With a sample of
3000 fb−1 of data, the statistical error will nominally decrease by about a factor of 5, resulting
in a statistical error of the order of 2.5%. If the remaining systematic errors (dominated for
the diphoton analysis by the spurious signal systematic error) remain the same, the resultant
systematic error would be of the order of 9%, leading to a total error of approximately 9.5%.
This is similar enough to the current theoretical uncertainty that it may motivate improvements
on the H + j cross section calculation. Of course, any improvements in the systematic errors
would reduce the experimental uncertainty further. Improvements in the theory could entail a
combination of the NNLOHTL results with the full NLOQCD results, similar to the reweighting
procedure that has been done one perturbative order lower.
Theoretical precision is not only needed for the full Higgs boson cross section, but specifi-
cally for production at high transverse momentum. High pT Higgs boson production is of great
interest, as it allows the probe of any new particles that may enter into the top quark loop, or
indeed of any other new physics that might become evident at high pT . The best foreseeable
precision requires the H + j calculation at N3LO. Traditionally, the boosted H →b¯b channel
has been viewed as the most efficient way to examine high transverse momentum Higgs boson
production, given the large branching ratio into that final state. For ATLAS, for example, with
the full Run 2 data sample at 13 TeV for H →b¯b, the 95% confidence-level upper limit on the
cross section for Higgs boson production with transverse momentum above 450 GeV is 115 fb
with an uncertainty of 128 fb) [552]. Above 1 TeV it is 9.6 fb with an uncertainty of 17 fb.
The Standard Model cross section predictions for a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV in the
same kinematic regions are 18.4 fb and 0.13 fb, respectively. Both results are consistent with
the standard model, but also allow for a possible interesting excess at high pT .
