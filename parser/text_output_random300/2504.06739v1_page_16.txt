expected from the three-band Hamiltonian.
This dis-
crepancy comes from the mean-ﬁeld solution of the La-
grange multiplier λA obtained from the limit rA →0+
in the four-band model as it should keep the eﬀective
level E0 + λA very close to the Fermi level when the hy-
bridization strength V approaches the boundary of the
SKS phase.
Here, we argue that this issue is linked to the quan-
tum ﬂuctuation of the Lagrangian multiplier ﬁeld λkA(τ)
around its mean-ﬁeld value. To ascertain this point, we
consider the ﬂuctuation δλkA while keeping the mean-
ﬁeld solution of qα.
In this case, by retaining the de-
pendence of the eﬀective action on the ﬁeld variables, we
have
S(0)
eff[cA, cB, dA, dB; rA = 0, rB, λA, λB]
(D15)
= S(0)
eff[cA, cB, dB; rB, λB] + S(0)
eff[dA; λA]
and
S(2)
eff[cA, cB, dA, dB, δbA, δbB; rA = 0, rB, λA, λB](D16)
= S(2)
eff[cA, cB, dB, δbB; rB, λB] + 2S(2)
eff[δbA; λA] .
Here, we only need to consider the diagonal term of the
corresponding Hamiltonian in the fA-part:
H(0)
eff[dA; λA] + 1
2H(2)
eff[δbA; λA]
=

¯dkAσ(τ)dkAσ(τ) + δb∗

The last term shows the presence of δλkA just in the
place of the mean-ﬁeld Lagrange parameter λA. Since the
integration of the ﬂuctuation δλkA runs over the whole
real axis which in turn recovers the δ-function imposed by
the no-double occupation constraint of the A-sublattice
f electrons. The relevant diagrams taking into account
of corrections from these ﬂuctuations are shown in Fig.14
schematically.
Above consideration suggests that in the SKS phase
the eﬀective action S(0)
eff[qα] + 1
2!S(2)
eff[qα] is similar to the
eﬀective action of the three-band interacting Hamiltonian
(involving ckAσ,ckBσ, dkBσ and rB, λB ), in addition to
the decoupled A-sublattice f electron Hamiltonian (in-
volving dkAσ, δbkA, and δλkA). This is due to the lin-
earity of the Lagrangian multiplier appeared in the ef-
fective Hamiltonian. After performing the path integral
over δλkA, the latter reproduces the representation of
the original decoupled Hamiltonian in terms of the A-
sublattice f electron operator fkAσ with the no-double
occupation constraint as illustrated in Fig.15. Therefore,
upon consideration of the quantum ﬂuctuation δλkA, the
decoupled f electrons remain at the bare level E0 as in
the three-band model.
