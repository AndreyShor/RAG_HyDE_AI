much larger than that analysed in this paper, and fitted according to the nominal model.
A systematic uncertainty is assigned adding the bias on the parameter of interest and
its uncertainty in quadrature. A summary of the most relevant sources of systematic
uncertainty on the observables is presented in Table 1. The total systematic uncertainty
on each observable is obtained by summing the contributions from individual sources in
quadrature.
A variety of sources of uncertainty related to the efficiency model are considered. An
uncertainty due to the limited order of the orthogonal functions used in the efficiency
model is estimated by trialling different increases in order in the pseudoexperiment
generation. An uncertainty is assigned to account for the unknown distribution of events
in q2 by evaluating the efficiency model at alternative points in q2 in the pseudoexperiment
generation, shifted from the median by the root-mean-square of the q2 distribution. The
small contribution from observables that, due to nonuniform angular efficiency, do not
vanish when projecting out the Φ and two-dimensional cos θe and cos θK distributions is
evaluated by including these additional terms in the generation. To assess the impact of
the limited size of the simulated signal sample, new angular efficiency models are derived
by bootstrapping the uniformly generated sample. Pseudoexperiments are generated
according to the new efficiency models and fitted using the nominal one. A similar
approach is used to assess the impact of the finite size of the simulated samples used
to model the semileptonic background and the data sample used to derive the shape of
