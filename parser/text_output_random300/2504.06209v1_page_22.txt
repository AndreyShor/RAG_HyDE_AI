FIG. 9. On finding a compatible Bayesian network of a Markov channel with two inputs and two outputs. (a): Circuit diagram
of a memoryless channel with input (W, X) and output (Y, z) described by transition matrix Φ, (b): a Bayesian network which
is not compatible with arbitrary Φ, and (c): a Bayesian network with an auxiliary variable V = Y Z which is compatible with
arbitrary Φ.
address the problem with Figure 9b (for instance [79, Lemma 1]), but it is a particularly simple solution which, as we
will see, allows one to use d-separation for percept-action loops. With this choice of V , we can write
pY ZV |W X = pY |V pZ|V pV |W X
(E6)
where, since V = Y Z, the conditional distribution pV |W X is given by the transition matrix Φ, pV |W X(y, z|w, x) =
ϕ(v|w, x) with v = (y, z), and pY |V , pZ|V are delta distributions since
pY |V (y|v) = pY |Y Z(y|y′, z′) = δy,y′,
(E7)
and similarly for pZ|V .
We recover the original channel from eq. (E6) through marginalization:

FIG. 10. Bayesian network of a general percept-action loop.
Applying the Bayesian network representation Figure 9c to the Markov channels of agent and environment in
agtM →
←envM leads us to the following
Given a distribution qV over a set of variables V compatible with a Bayesian network B, for any subset W ⊆V ,
let G(q, W) denote the set of Markov conditions
I[S; T|R] = 0
(E12)
with respect to q for all three sets S, T, R ⊂W of nodes for which S and T are d-separated by R.
