The New Frontier: Meso-scale All-atom Simulations
Orb-v3â€™s most obvious application is replacing DFT in conventional workflows with a more
efficient method with comparable accuracy and lower memory requirements. However, this
merely enhances rather than transforms our simulation capabilities.
Far more exciting is the possibility of applying Orb-v3 to study systems that have previously
been impossible to simulate accurately due to the large number of atoms involved and the lack of
existing accurately parameterized empirical forcefields [24]. Orb-v3 opens a new frontier where
quantum mechanical accuracy can be maintained while exploring emergent phenomena arising
from the collective behavior of thousands of atoms, such as crystal nucleation and growth
[46], self-assembly of complex nanostructures such as metal organic frameworks [39], or phase
diagrams of complex alloys [35].
For example, in concurrent work [38], we have demonstrated the potential to study such mesoscale
systems by simulating the carbonic anhydrase II enzyme. Using orb-v3-direct-inf-omat
we simulate this enzyme under fully solvated conditions with no physical constraints using
Langevin dynamics at 300 K. (See Figure 5). Despite being extremely out-of-distribution, and
containing over 20,000 atoms, we do not observe unphysical behavior and the structure remains
close to the original PDB structure throughout.
While additional validation work remains to be done, the fact that Orb-v3 can provide long,
stable simulations of a system so far outside the training data distribution is a strong indicator
of the generality and potential of this new tool.

orb-v3-direct-inf-omat for over 700 ps. The enzyme is depicted as its amino acid rep-
resentation for visual clarity, but simulations use the full all-atom representation.
