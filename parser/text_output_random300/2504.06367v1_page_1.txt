This study sets new constraints on Cold+Warm Dark Matter (CWDM) models by leveraging the small-scale
suppression of structure formation imprinted in the Lyman-𝛼forest. Using the Sherwood-Relics suite, we extract
high-fidelity flux power spectra from simulated Lyman-𝛼forest data, spanning a broad range of cosmologies and
thermal histories. This enables precise constraints on the warm dark matter (WDM) fraction, 𝑓WDM, and the
mass of the WDM particle, 𝑚WDM. A key advancement of our analysis is the integration of a neural network
emulator directly at the likelihood level, significantly accelerating Bayesian parameter inference. With new
observations of high-redshift (𝑧= 4.2−5.0) quasar spectra from UVES and HIRES, we establish stringent upper
limits: for 𝑚WDM = 1 keV, we find 𝑓WDM < 0.16 (2𝜎), with constraints loosening to 35%, 50%, and 67% for
𝑚WDM = 2, 3, and 4 keV, respectively. Our results for pure WDM reaffirm the lower bounds of previous work.
Crucially, we account for the fixed resolution of simulations and the impact of patchy reionization, demonstrating
their minimal influence on mixed dark matter constraints. This robustness paves the way for tighter bounds with
improved statistical samples in the future. Our findings suggest that CWDM models can naturally accommodate
mild suppression of matter clustering in the high redshift Lyman-𝛼forest 1D flux power, potentially offering a
resolution to some of the ongoing cosmological tensions at low redshifts, namely the 𝑆8 tension.

INTRODUCTION
In the standard cosmological model, ΛCDM, cold non-
baryonic dark matter with negligible primordial velocities con-
stitutes approximately ΩCDM ≈0.26 of the total energy density
of the Universe. This model provides a pivotal framework for
galaxy formation theory, where the hierarchical merging of
non-linear dark matter structures, or haloes, plays a key role in
shaping the large-scale structure of the Universe. In this con-
text, the ΛCDM paradigm accurately predicts the evolution of
the matter power spectrum across cosmic time from CMB ob-
servations [1], demonstrating remarkable success in matching
observations down to scales comparable to the average spacing
between galaxies (≈a few Mpc).
At smaller scales, however, discrepancies arise between
theoretical predictions from N-body simulations and obser-
vational data. Some of these inconsistencies stem from the
hierarchical nature of the theory. While the apparent mismatch
in the number of dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way (Missing
Satellites Problem, [2, 3]), has been largely resolved through
new observations of faint satellites ([4]) and improved baryonic
modelling in high-resolution simulations (e.g. [5, 6]), other
tensions persist. The most significant among these is related
to the amount of dark matter in the inner parts of galaxies
(Cusp-Core Problem, [7]), particularly the challenge of ex-
plaining the diverse rotation curves observed [8]. Moreover,
while the dynamics of the most massive Milky Way satellites
(Too-Big-To-Fail Problem, [9, 10]) are now better understood
through updated cosmological simulations (e.g. [11, 12]), the
situation remains unclear for satellites outside the vicinity of
the Milky Way ([13]).
Another key challenge of CDM (cold dark matter) on
small scales involves the amplitude of matter density fluc-
tuations, quantified by 𝜎8.
The parameter combination
𝑆8 = 𝜎8
√︁
Ωm/0.3 has given rise to the so-called 𝑆8 tension,
where cosmic shear, galaxy clustering surveys, and their cross-
correlation with CMB lensing (e.g. [14–20]) suggest lower
values than those inferred from the CMB ([1]).
