5.4.2. Charged Particle Motion with Λe = 0
There are two qualtiatively distinct cases of charged particle motion: attractive, when
the particles have opposite sign charges, and repulsive, when the charges have the same
sign. The situation becomes further complicated for nonzero Λe, and so it is more instructive
to ﬁrst consider Λe = 0. Since the charges appear in all solutions as the product e1e2, it is
sufﬁcient to set e1 = −e2 = q for the attractive case and e1 = e2 = q for the repulsive case.
For Λe = 0, (117) simpliﬁes to

from (118) and (119) and p(τ) has the form (101) with f0 →fe; the relative distance r(τ) is
likewise obtained from (107)–(110).

−8κe1e2 > 0 in the attractive case and the two
particles always remain bound, with the motion described by the tanh-type solution (107).
As expected, as |q| increases, the particles are more tightly bound. This is clear from Figure 8,
where the maximal separation of the particles decreases as |q| increases, due to the additional
electromagnetic attraction. The frequency of the motion correspondingly increases.

Although the above expression diverges when γe =

2p0+H , this situation is never realized
in the attractive case, since γe < 1 whereas

2p0+H > 1.
It is instructive to compare the exact relativistic motion to the motion in three
