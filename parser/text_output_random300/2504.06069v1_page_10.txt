constrained network. This is because we have embedded this physical law directly into the model 
architecture through the sigmoid activation in the amplitude branch. It automatically ensures 
amplitude values never exceed the physical range of [0 , 1], and thus leads to more efficient learning 
process. In contrast, without this activation, the model requires several epochs to learn this constraint 
(see bottom diagram in Figure III-b). The phase loss, however, converges more gradually, reflecting 
the complexity of phase prediction (Figure III-c).

models with and without sigmoid activation in the amplitude output, respectively. 
 
 
Table I presents the model’s performance that is averaged over 10 runs with different random 
initializations for both datasets. The amplitude loss is quite low for both datasets, confirming the 
ability of the model to make accurate predictions. The energy conservation loss is effectively zero, 
demonstrating that our physics-constraint architecture successfully enforces this fundamental physics 
law. The phase loss, that measures Euclidean distance in sine/cosine space between true and 
predicted phase values, stabilizes around 0.11 for both datasets, corresponding to a prediction error 
of about 5.5%. To quantify the phase prediction error, we calculate the angular difference between 
true and predicted phase values using the dot product of their unit vector representations. For each 
data point, we calculate cos(𝜑𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒) . cos(𝜑𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡) + sin(𝜑𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒) . sin(𝜑𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡), which yields the 
cosine of the angular difference. We then apply the inverse cosine function to obtain the angular 
difference in radians. This approach provides physically meaningful error in radians. As seen in the 
table, the mean angular error for Dataset A is 0.114 radians (approximately 6.5°), while for Dataset B, 
it is 0.124 radians (approximately 7.1°).  The R2 (known as coefficient of determination) for prediction 
of phase values is about 0.906 for Dataset B and 0.928 for Dataset A, where value 1 means perfect
