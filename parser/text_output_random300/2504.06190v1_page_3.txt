regarded as effective low-energy theories valid at energies smaller than MS, if
supersymmetry is not fully broken at the string scale, and also smaller than
MC, if supersymmetry is not fully broken in the compactification to d = 4
space-time dimensions.
In any realistic supergravity model, supersymmetry should be completely
broken, as we do not observe supersymmetric partners of the known particles,
and the breaking should be spontaneous, through the super-Higgs effect [1, 2,
3]. Since the general scalar potential of supergravity is not positive definite,
the question then arises of whether local supersymmetry can be completely
broken with vanishing vacuum energy, i.e. on a flat Minkowski background.
In the first models of N = 1, d = 4 spontaneously broken supergravity [4],
this was achieved by a fine tuning of the model parameters.
In 1983 Cremmer, Ferrara, Kounnas and Nanopoulos [5] (see also [6])
gave the first examples of N = 1, d = 4 supergravity models where, at
the classical level: supersymmetry is broken with vanishing vacuum energy
on a continuum of inequivalent degenerate vacua; the gravitino mass m3/2,
setting the supersymmetry-breaking scale in Minkowski space, slides along
such flat direction in field space; the potential is positive semi-definite, so
that when moving along the flat directions there are no classical instabilities
in other directions. The term no-scale models appeared soon after, in some
papers [7, 8, 9] that tried to explore how the hierarchy mW ∼m3/2 ≪MP
could be dynamically generated 2. Since then, such term has been used both
in the supergravity literature and (often abusively) in the phenomenological
literature on extensions of the SM with softly broken supersymmetry. In the
following I will use it only for supergravity models with the three classical
properties described above, or at least the first two.
From the early days of no-scale models, it was realised (see e.g. [11]) that
they must address a number of stability issues. If the mW /MP hierarchy
is to be generated by infrared logarithmic quantum corrections via dimen-
sional transmutation [12, 13], then quantum corrections to the effective po-
tential should be at most O(m4
3/2), not O(m2
3/2M2
P ) as expected on general
grounds in spontaneously broken N = 1 supergravity. A much softer ultravi-
olet behaviour is required, to leave room for this possibility, in models where
m3/2 ≫mW , as well as when we want to address the approximate stability
of the flat Minkowski background. Despite some progress along these lines,
to be described later, we are still far from a convincing solution.
With a personal selection, which will unavoidably neglect many impor-
2 In those early explorations the contributions to the effective potential of order m4
3/2 were
omitted, and included only later [10].
