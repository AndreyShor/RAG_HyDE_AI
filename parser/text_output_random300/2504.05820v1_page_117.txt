4.1.3. The non-singlet sector
Information on the Mellin moments of non-singlet anomalous dimensions is especially abundant,
in that eight moments of γ(3)
ns,± and nine moments of γ(3)
ns,s are known. An approximation
based on this knowledge was given in Ref. [292]. More recently, further information on the
small-x behavior of γ(3)
ns,± was derived in Ref. [293]. While for γ(3)
ns,s we directly rely on the
approximation of Ref. [292], which already includes all the available information, we construct
an approximation to γ(3)
ns,± based on the procedure described in Section 4.1.1, in order to
include also this more recent information, and also as a warm-up for the construction of our
approximation to the singlet sector anomalous dimension that we present in the next section.
Contributions to γ(3)
ns,± proportional to n2
f and n3
f are known exactly [291] (in particular the
n3
f contributions to γ(3)
ns,± coincide), while O(n0
f) and O(nf) terms 1 are known in the large-Nc
limit [292] and we include these in γ(3)
ns,±,nf (N).
Small-x contributions to γns,± are double logarithmic, i.e. of the form an+1

The coefficients ck

approximately up to N6LL (k = 1, 2, 3). Hence, we let

Large-x logarithmic contributions in the MS scheme only appear in coefficient functions [306],
and so the x →1 behavior of splitting functions is provided by the cusp anomalous dimension
