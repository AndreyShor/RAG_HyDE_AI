energy logarithms allows for the description of scattering events where jets with large rapid-
ity intervals are detected [10–17]. Further, the Regge limit has been explored extensively in
both N = 4 SYM [18–25] and QCD [26–49] amplitudes and cross sections [50, 51], and it has
been used to constrain, compute or validate amplitudes in general kinematics [46, 47, 52–
58]. Finally, the Regge limit allows also for an eﬀective ﬁeld theory description [41, 59–73].
The BFKL equation describes the rapidity evolution of the gluon ladder exchanged in
the t channel in terms of an integral over transverse momentum. The logarithmic accuracy
of the equation is driven by the accuracy of its kernel. At LL accuracy [2–5], the leading-
order kernel is composed by the central-emission vertex (CEV) of the gluon [2], which
ﬁrst occurs in the tree-level 2 →3 amplitude in multi-Regge kinematics (MRK), where
the outgoing partons are strongly ordered in rapidity. The soft divergences of the kernel
are regulated by the soft structure of the one-loop gluon Regge trajectory, which arises
from the virtual radiative corrections to the 2 →2 scattering. At LL accuracy, each gluon
emission along the ladder introduces a factor of O(αS log(s/|t|)) after rapidity integration,
thus the BFKL equation resums the corrections of O(αn
S logn(s/|t|)).
At NLL accuracy, the BFKL equation resums the corrections of O(αn+1
S
logn(s/|t|)) [6–
9], by evaluating the radiative corrections to the gluon CEV. Namely, its next-to-leading
order (NLO) kernel is composed by the CEV for the emission of two gluons or a quark-
antiquark pair [26, 30, 33, 34] in next-to-multi-Regge kinematics (NMRK), where the two
partons in the CEV are not ordered in rapidity (thus yielding, over the phase-space in-
tegration, a power of αS but no powers of log(s/|t|)), and by the one-loop corrections to
the gluon CEV [27, 28, 36, 38, 39]. The ensuing soft divergences of the kernel are then
regulated by the two-loop gluon Regge trajectory [31, 32, 35, 40, 74].
Underpinning the picture above is the fact that at LL and NLL accuracy, the virtual
radiative corrections may be seen as corrections to the propagator of the gluon exchanged
in the t channel, a fact which is termed gluon Reggeization [75, 76], while the exchange
of the gluon in the t channel is called single Reggeon exchange. Beyond NLL accuracy,
the single-Reggeon picture breaks down [40]. Also (Regge) cut contributions occur, which
may be interpreted as a triple-Reggeon exchange [40, 43, 44, 47, 77–79]. Therefore, the
determination of the three-loop Regge trajectory [46, 80, 81] and of the two-loop corrections
to the gluon CEV [48, 49] require disentangling the single-Reggeon and triple-Reggeon
contributions [46, 48, 49, 81].
After the disentangling of the single-Reggeon and triple-Reggeon contributions is done,
one may consider carrying the BFKL program on to NNLL accuracy, by evaluating the
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) corrections to the kernel, which require the one-loop
corrections to the CEV for the emission of two gluons or a quark-antiquark pair in NMRK
– so far, computed only for two gluons [82] in N = 4 SYM – and the CEV for the emission
of three partons in next-to-next-to-multi-Regge kinematics (NNMRK) [83–86], in addition
to the aforementioned two-loop corrections to the gluon CEV.
An amplitude, and thus a cross section, with exchange of a gluon ladder in the t channel
is then obtained by convoluting the ladder with process-dependent impact factors, which
sit at the ends of the ladder. The accuracy in αS at which impact factors are required is
driven by the logarithmic accuracy of the gluon ladder: an amplitude for jet production at
