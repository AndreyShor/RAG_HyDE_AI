FIG. 9. Bare atomic and molecular states used to form pair states. While the amount of states grows exponentially (2n+1)
with the number of molecules n, the number of pair states with only one dipolar quanta grows linearly as n + 1.
In a tractable simulation, we include up to 10 nearest KRb molecules per Rydberg atom. Fig. 10 shows the FWHM
of the simulated Rydberg spectra close to the pair state resonance as a function of the number of KRb molecules
included in the calculations. The results indicate that incorporating at least three nearest neighbors is necessary
to reproduce approximately 90% of the observed spectral broadening. As we include more molecules, the simulated
broadening saturates, suggesting diminishing contributions from more distant neighbors.
Monte Carlo simulation
Using the techniques discussed above, we can generate the Hamiltonian to describe the interaction of n molecules
with a Rydberg atom. The experimental observable we wish to capture is the Rydberg population as a function of the
Rydberg drive detuning. As such, we expanded the Hamiltonian, previously defined only in the Rydberg/molecule
subspace (Eq. 5), to the basis including the ground state of the atom {|R⟩|0, 0, 0...0⟩, |r⟩|1m
j ⟩} ⊕|g⟩|0, 0, 0, ..., 0⟩with,
H =H0 ⊕(δ|g⟩|0, 0, 0, ..., 0⟩⟨g|⟨0, 0, 0, ..., 0|
+ Ω|g⟩|0, 0, 0, ..., 0⟩⟨R|⟨0, 0, 0, ..., 0| + h.c),
(8)
where δ is the drive detuning and Ωis the Rydberg drive Rabi rate.
The time dynamics over the 3 µs of the Rydberg drive was carried out using a master equation with the Hamiltonian
in Eq. 8 and the dephasing Lindblad term generated by the operator √γ|g⟩⟨g| to capture drive decoherence from the
phase noise of the laser. The Rabi rate of Ω= 2π×50 kHz was selected from calculations based on beam intensity and
polarization. Decoherence rate of γ = 2π × 900 kHz was selected to match the Rydberg excitation linewidth without
resonant interactions with molecules as measured at large pair state detuning ∆. The initial state of the system was
|g⟩|0, 0, 0, . . . , 0⟩⟨g|⟨0, 0, 0, . . . , 0|.
In addition to the expansion of Hilbert space, we also needed to account for the inhomogeneous broadening present as
a result of the randomized interaction distances in the ensemble. This could be realized with a Monte Carlo simulation
