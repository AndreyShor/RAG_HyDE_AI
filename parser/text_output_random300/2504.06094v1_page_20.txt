Proof. We already observed that B1 becomes a subobject of Zreg, hence it is enough to show
that the underlying C-objects agree. By the above decomposition of A, we have
B1 ≃
M
Y1,Y2∈Irr(C)
Y1 ⊠A−Y2 ⊗Ω(Y ∗
1 ) ⊠A+ Ω(Y ∗
2 ).
To get the underlying object (B1)−in C, we take the A+-central vectors, or equivalently, re-
place Ω(Y ∗
1 ) ⊠A+ Ω(Y ∗
2 ) by HomC+(A+, Ω(Y ∗
1 ) ⊠A+ Ω(Y ∗
2 )). Since the Yi are irreducible, this is
nontrivial (then 1-dimensional) if and only if Y2 is isomorphic to Y ∗
1 . We thus have
(B1)−≃
M
Y ∈Irr(C)
Y ⊠A−Y ∗,
which proves the claim.

Theorem 5.17. Suppose A• satisﬁes charge-transporter generation 4.10, algebraic Haag dual-
ity 2.2, and that it is locally aligned 5.6. Then DHR(A•) is equivalent to Z(C).
Proof. We need to check that the category Z′ is spanned by the monoidal unit of Z(C). By
Proposition 5.13, it is enough to check this at the level of underlying objects. Since we know
that B1 is isomorphic to Zreg, the claim follows from Proposition 3.1.

5.4. Converse for local alignment. In this subsection we assume strict Haag duality, and
consider the unitary tensor equivalence Ω: C−→Cmop from above.
Theorem 5.18. Let A• be a rational abstract spin chain 3.3 satisfying algebraic Haag dual-
ity 2.2. Suppose that the canonical functor DHR(A•) →Z(C−) is an equivalence. Then the
basic construction B1 is a DHR-bimodule.
Proof. Given an A-A-correspondence H with right A-valued inner product ⟨ξ, η⟩A, we restrict
H to a B0-B0-bimodule and equip it with the right B0-valued inner product
⟨ξ | η⟩B0 = E (⟨ξ | η⟩A) .
Since B0
E⊂A is a ﬁnite index inclusion, H is complete for this B0-valued inner product,
and it becomes a B0-B0 correspondence. This construction provides a functor π: Corr(A) →
Corr(B0). Let E be the full sub-category of dualizable A-A-correspondences H such that π(H)
is in the image of C−⊠C+ inside Corr(B0). Then since the 2-category of C*-algebras and corre-
spondences is Q-system complete [CHPJP22], E is equivalent to the category of A-A bimodules
internal to C−⊠C+. Then B1 = A ⊠B0 A ∈E.
On the other hand, since A is a realization of the symmetric enveloping Q-system in C−⊠
Cmop
−
≃C−⊠C+, then E ≃Z(C−). But since π(DHR(A•)) ⊂C−⊠C+, DHR(A•) ⊆E. Finally
since DHR(A•) ≃Z(C−), then DHR(A•) = E so B1 ∈DHR(A•).

6. Abstract spin chains from C∗-2-categories
In this section, we will construct abstract spin chains in the spirit of the fusion spin chains
studied in [Jon24]. However, the categories we consider will be more general, and the resulting
net of algebras will not be translation invariant. We will illustrate the various conditions we
have introduced in the previous section for this class of abstract spin chains.
Let us ﬁx a ﬁnite rigid C∗-2-category C = (Cij)i,j∈S such that the monoidal categories Ci := Cii
at the diagonal are C∗-fusion categories.
Then Cij is an invertible Ci-Cj-bimodule category.
Given X ∈Cij, we denote the normalized categorical trace on End(X) by trX. Note that we
have
trX⊗Y = trX ◦(id ⊗trY ) = trY ◦(trX ⊗id)
on End(X ⊗Y ) for Y ∈Cjk.
