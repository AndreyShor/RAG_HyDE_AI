FIG. 5: (a) An ideal tetrahedron. (b) An ideal octahedron composed of 4 ideal tetrahedra. The part of
boundaries shaded in gray are called the cusp boundaries and they are located on the boundaries of S3\Γ5 in
T(S3\Γ5). See e.g. [9] for more descriptions.
The solution space of the Chern-Simons theory in ∆is given by the flatness conditions
z′′ + z−1 −1 = 0 ,
˜z′′ + ˜z−1 −1 = 0
(29)
which restricts P∂∆to its Lagrangian submanifold
L∆= {(z, z′′; ˜z, ˜z′′) ∈P∂∆|z′′ + z−1 −1 = 0, ˜z′′ + ˜z−1 −1 = 0} .
(30)
The quantization of (29) into constraint operator solves for the wave function, or the Chern-Simons partition function
on ∆, which turns out to be the quantum dilogarithm function Ψ∆(z, ˜z) [23, 24]. The exact expression of Ψ∆(z, ˜z) is
not important in the following analysis, so we omit it here.
As an ideal octahedron is formed by gluing four ideal tetrahedra (r.f. fig.5b), the partition function ZOct is a
product of four quantum dilogarithm functions. Note that there is one internal edge, a flatness condition has to be
imposed on the FG coordinates x, y, z, w and ˜x, ˜y, ˜z, ˜w from the four ideal tetrahedra dressing the internal edge to
enforce flat connection in the bulk, which reads
xyzw = 1 ,
˜x˜y˜z ˜w = 1 .
(31)
It eliminates the variables from one of the ideal tetrahedra, say w, ˜w from ∆w. The phase space P∂Oct on ∂Oct is
spanned by position variables x, y, z and momentum variables px = x′′ −w′′, py = y′′ −w′′, pz = z′′ −w′′.
Since all the edges of ideal tetrahedra in T(S3\Γ5) are on the boundary (r.f. fig.4), no additional constraints need
to be added. This means the phase space P∂(S3\Γ5) on ∂(S3\Γ5) is simply the direct product of five copies of P∂Oct(i).
Package the logarithmic phase space coordinates into vectors and their anti-holomorphic counterparts:
⃗Φ ≡ln ⃗ϕ = ({Xi, Yi, Zi}5
i=1)⊤,
⃗Π ≡ln⃗π = ({PXi, PYi, PZi}5
i=1)⊤,
⃗eΦ ≡ln ⃗˜ϕ = ({ e
Xi, eYi, eZi}5
i=1)⊤,
⃗eΠ ≡ln⃗˜π = ({P e
Xi, PeYi, P e
Zi}5
i=1)⊤,
(32)
where Zi = ln zi, PZi = ln pzi with zi = xi, yi, zi, ˜xi, ˜yi, ˜zi and Zi = Xi, Yi, Zi, e
Xi, eYi, eZi. The elements of ⃗Φ, ⃗Π, ⃗eΦ, ⃗eΠ
satisfy the Poisson bracket
{ΦI, ΠJ} = δIJ ,
{ΦI, eΦJ} = {ΦI, eΠJ} = {ΠI, eΦJ} = {ΠI, eΠJ} = 0 ,
∀I, J = 1, · · · , 15 .
(33)
The partition function on S3\Γ5 is simply the product of five ZOct’s:
Z×({xi, yi, zi; ˜xi, ˜yi, ˜zi}5
i=1) =
