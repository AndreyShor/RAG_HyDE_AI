becomes equivalent to ⟨πω|Li|ψx,θ⟩= µω,ij ⟨πω|Lj|ψx,θ⟩
for all i, j and x.
This can be also rewritten as
⟨πω|Li|ψx,θ⟩/ ⟨πω|Lj|ψx,θ⟩= ⟨πω|Li|ψy,θ⟩/ ⟨πω|Lj|ψy,θ⟩
for all i, j and x, y. It immediately leads to the necessary
and suﬃcient condition
⟨πω| ⊗⟨πω| (Li ⊗Lj −Lj ⊗Li) |ψx,θ⟩⊗|ψy,θ⟩= 0, (30)
for all i, j, ω, x, y.
Appendix G: Expressions for pure states and unitary
transformations.—
Here we present the explicit expres-
sions for the key quantities discussed in this manuscript,
considering the simple case of a pure state |ψθ⟩= Uθ |ψ⟩,
where Uθ is a unitary parameter-encoding transforma-
tion. A direct calculation yields
[FQ]ij =2 ⟨HiHj +HjHi⟩−4 ⟨Hi⟩⟨Hj⟩,
(31a)
[G]ij =−2i ⟨HiHj−HjHi⟩,
(31b)
[FC + I]ij =2 ⟨HiNHj +HjNHi⟩−4 ⟨Hi⟩⟨Hj⟩,
(31c)
[FC]ij =⟨HiNHj +HjNHi⟩−ηij,
(31d)
[I]ij =⟨HiNHj +HjNHi⟩−4 ⟨Hi⟩⟨Hj⟩+ηij, (31e)
[D]ij =−2i ⟨HiNHj −HjNHi⟩,
(31f)
where Hi = −i(∂iU †
θ)Uθ are Hermitian generators, N ≡
U †
θM(|ψθ⟩)Uθ with M(|ψθ⟩) deﬁned in Eq. (7), ⟨X⟩≡
⟨ψ|X|ψ⟩for an operator X, and ηij ≡⟨ψ ⊗ψ|Oij|ψ ⊗ψ⟩
with Oij given by
Oij =
X
ω
1
pω(θ)(EωHi ⊗EωHj + HiEω ⊗HjEω).
(32)
Note that in the above expressions, the θ-dependence of
each term is omitted. In particular, for a rank-one POVM
{Eω = |πω⟩⟨πω|}, we notice N =
1 since M(|ψθ⟩) =
1.
Appendix H: Necessary and suﬃcient condition for
I(̺θ) = 0.—
Similarly to Appendix A, let us write
I(̺θ) = P
ω Iω(̺θ), where Iω(̺θ) ≡Iω(̺θ, {Eω}) has
elements
[Iω(̺θ)]ij =

pω(θ)
for Regular
lim
˜θ→θ
Im[χω,i(˜θ)]Im[χω,j(˜θ)]

for Null
The necessary and suﬃcient condition for I(̺θ) = 0 is
given by Iω(̺θ) = 0 for all ω, since Iω(̺θ) are positive-
semideﬁnite matrices.
For a rank-one regular POVM Eω = |πω⟩⟨πω|, the con-
dition Im[χω,i(θ)] = 0 for all i is equivalent to
⟨πω|Li̺θ −̺θLi|πω⟩= 0,
∀i.
(33)
For pure states, using Li = 2(|∂iψθ⟩⟨ψθ| + |ψθ⟩⟨∂iψθ|),
we can thus rewrite Eq. (33) as Im[⟨∂iψθ|πω⟩⟨πω|ψθ⟩] =
|⟨ψθ|πω⟩|2Im[⟨∂iψθ|ψθ⟩], which is equivalent to the nec-
essary and suﬃcient condition for FC(|ψθ⟩) = FQ(|ψθ⟩)
presented in Eq. (8) of Ref. [47].
For mixed states,
Eq. (33) becomes equivalent to the existence of real co-
eﬃcients µω,i such that ⟨πω|ψx,θ⟩= µω,i ⟨πω|Li|ψx,θ⟩.
This recovers the necessary and suﬃcient condition for
FC(̺θ) = FQ(̺θ) presented in Eq. (39) of Ref. [48].
For a rank-one null POVM Eω = |πω⟩⟨πω|, the condi-
tion Im[χω,i(˜θ)] = 0 for all i is equivalent to
⟨πω|Li̺θLj −Lj̺θLi|πω⟩= 0,
∀i, j,
(34)
where we used that χω,j(˜θ) = P
ij[Qω(̺θ)]ijδθi given
in Appendix
D with [Qω(̺θ)]ij
=
tr(̺θLiEωLj).
For pure states,
we can thus rewrite Eq. (34) as
Im[⟨∂iψθ|πω⟩⟨πω|∂jψθ⟩] =
0, which is equivalent to
Eq. (7) of Ref. [47]. For mixed states, Eq. (34) becomes
equivalent to the existence of real coeﬃcients µω,ij such
that ⟨πω|Li|ψx,θ⟩= µω,ij ⟨πω|Lj|ψx,θ⟩. This recovers the
previous condition presented in Eq. (44) of Ref. [48].
