An element in T ∈HomC(1, Y ) is represented by a A−-central vector η ∈Y . We need to show
that, for any X ∈DHR(A•) and any ξ ∈X−, the half-braiding cX : Y ⊠A−X−→X−⊠A−Y
sends η ⊗ξ to ξ ⊗η.
Fix a basis (ξi)i in X localized to the left of the support of η, and write ξ = P
i ξiai. We
then have
ξ ⊗η =
X
i
ξi ⊗ηai
by the A−-centrality of η. In view of the A−-bimodularity of cX, it is enough to check cX(η ⊗
ξi) = ξi ⊗η. This follows from the commutation of (Y, c) and (X, βX,•).

Let us assume algebraic Haag duality now. We are going to observe that B1 becomes isomor-
phic in Z(C) to the algebra object Zreg of Section 3, from which we can conclude DHR(A•) ≃
Z(C). Recall that, under this assumption, we have an equivalence Ω: C = C−→Cmop
+
charac-
terized by the isomorphism of B0-A-bimodules Y ⊠A−A ≃Ω(Y ) ⊠A+ A.
The ﬁrst step is to see that the image of B1 in Z(C) is a direct summand of Zreg. Recall that
Zreg is the image of 1C under the functor L: C →Z(C) which is (both left and right) adjoint to
the forgetful functor U : Z(C) →C.
The B0-A-bimodule corresponding to 1C is A. Moreover, up to the full embedding of C into
the category of B0-A-modules, the composition of functors
DHR(A•)
Z(C)
C
U
corresponds to the restriction of scalars from A-bimodules to B0-A-modules. Thus, the adjoint
functor C →DHR(A•) sends 1C to B1 = A ⊠B0 A.
This shows that B1 is the image of Zreg for the functor Z(C) →DHR(A•) adjoint to the
inclusion of DHR(A•) to Z(C), that is, B1 is a subobject of Zreg in Z(C). We want to show
that they agree.
Proposition 5.14. Let Y ∈C and Y ′ ∈C+ be irreducible bimodules. The B0-bimodule Y ⊗Y ′
appears as a direct summand of A if and only if Ω(Y ) is the dual object of Y ′.
Proof. On one hand, having a nonzero B0-bimodule homomorphism Y ⊗Y ′ →A is equivalent
to having a nonzero B0-A-module homomorphism Y ⊗Y ′ ⊠B0 A →A. On the other, by the
above characterization of Ω, we have
Y ⊗Y ′ ⊠B0 A ≃Y ′ ⊠A+ Ω(Y ) ⊠A+ A.
Combining these, an embedding of Y ⊗Y ′ into A corresponds to a nonzero A+-bimodule ho-
momorphism from Y ′ ⊠A+ Ω(Y ) to A+, which is a characterization of Ω(Y ) being dual to
Y ′.

Corollary 5.15. Let Y be an irreducible object in C. Then Y ⊗Ω(Y ∗) appears as a direct
summand of A.
Proof. By the above proposition, it is enough to check that there is some nonzero homomorphism
from Y ⊗Y ′ to A, for some Y ′ ∈C+. This was indeed observed in the proof of Corollary 4.19.
□
We now have a decomposition
A ≃

Y ∈Irr(C)
Y ⊗Ω(Y ∗),
reﬁning Proposition 4.13.
Proposition 5.16. The image of B1 in Z(C) is isomorphic to Zreg.
