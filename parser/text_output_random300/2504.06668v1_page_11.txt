• Contraceptive Use Ci(t): A binary variable indicating the contraceptive
use by agent Ai at time t.
• Deprivation Di(t): A continuous variable representing the socioeconomic
deprivation of agent Ai.
• Violence Vi(t): A continuous variable representing the exposure to
violence.
• Substance Abuse SAbi(t): A binary variable representing substance
abuse by agent Ai at time t.
Cusp Catastrophe Control Parameters
The dynamics of pregnancy evolution are governed by the cusp catastrophe
potential function:
V (y, α, β) = 1
4y4 −1
2αy2 −βy
where:
• y: State variable (pregnancy state) for the agent.
• α: Normal control parameter, affected by contraceptive use.
• β: Catastrophic control parameter, affected by deprivation, violence, and
substance abuse.
Normal Control Parameter αi(t)
The normal control parameter αi(t) evolves based on contraceptive use:
αi(t) = α0 + λ1Ci(t)
where:
• α0 is a baseline value for the normal control.
• λ1 is the influence of contraceptive use on the normal control.
