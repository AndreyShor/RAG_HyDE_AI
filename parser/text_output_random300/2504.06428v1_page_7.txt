ab and M(ξba) is defined in the same way as M(ξab) but with spinors |ξba⟩and its dual |ξba] as
eigenvectors of Oba at bb on Sb. Importantly, the 3D normal vector to △ab in the local frame of tetrab defined as
ˆnba =
(
⟨ξba|⃗σ|ξba⟩,

−⟨ξba|⃗σ|ξba⟩
if aab ∈[3π/|Λ|, 6π/|Λ|)
(20)
is different from ˆnab in general as the two spinors are different. Indeed, ˆnab and ˆnab are related by the dihedral angle,
denoted as Θab of tetraa and tetrab hinged by △ab. Θab is encoded in the frame-changing holonomy Gab and the pair
of spinors (|ξab⟩, |ξba⟩) (or (|ξab], |ξba])):

where Θab, θab ∈R and V4 is the volume of the 4-simplex. θab is a non-geometrical parameter. Then |ξab⟩(resp. |ξab])
and |ξba⟩(resp. |ξba]) are related by a simple parallel transport:
|ξab⟩= γ−1

|ξab] = γabGab|ξba] .

Therefore, given the geometry of a 4-simplex, including the areas and normals of all triangles in different tetrahedron
frames, one can reconstruct all the Gab’s up to some phases {θab}a̸=b determined by the boundary condition (as all
edges of a 4-simplex are on the boundary). Further, flat connection holonomies { eHab} on S3\Γ5 can be determined
by {Gab} through (10) up to an SL(2, C) gauge as Gab is invariant under the gauge transformation from the left
ga →hga , ∀h ∈SL(2, C) (r.f. (13)). Such a gauge transformation corresponds to changing the common base point
b →b′ for defining { eHab}.

REVIEW OF THE SPINFOAM MODEL WITH Λ ̸= 0 AND THE CRITICAL POINTS
In this section, we give a brief review of the 4D Lorentzian spinfoam model with a cosmological constant first
introduced in [9] and recently improved in [1].
The description here is based on the latter.
We will focus on
the classical theory and critical points of the spinfoam amplitude, which are necessary ingredients for geometrical
reconstruction, and refer readers to [1, 9] for a more detailed description of how the amplitude is constructed.
Consider a simplicial 4-complex whose dual graph, also called the spinfoam graph, is such that its edges can be
dressed with number 0, · · · , 4 in a way as a colored graph in colored tensor model [16, 17]. We say such spinfoam graphs
are colorable. An example of colorable spinfoam graph is the melonic spinfoam graph discussed in [10]. The spinfoam
amplitude for a 4-complex respects the local amplitude ansatz and is written as the product of vertex amplitudes, each
associated to one 4-simplex in the simplicial decomposition or one vertex in the spinfoam graph, edge amplitudes,
each associated to one internal tetrahedron or one edge in the spinfoam graph, and face amplitudes, each associated
to one internal triangle or one face in the spinfoam graph.
We first define the vertex amplitude, which is the key to the spinfoam model and encodes the dynamics of LQG.
The vertex amplitude can be understood as the constrained SL(2, C) Chern-Simons partition function on S3\Γ5. The
Chern-Simons theory has a complex coupling constant
t = k + is ,
k = 8N =

(23)
where γ ∈R is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. The kinematical phase space is the moduli space of SL(2, C) flat
connection on the boundary of S3\Γ5, denoted as
P∂(S3\Γ5) = Mflat(∂(S3\Γ5), SL(2, C)) .
(24)
It is (complex) 30-dimensional.
The boundary ∂(S3\Γ5) is composed of five 4-holed spheres, each produced by
removing the open ball around a vertex of Γ5, and ten annuli, each produced by removing the open neighbourhood
of an edge of Γ5. To describe P∂(S3\Γ5), we choose a set of symplectic coordinates locally associated to the 4-hole
spheres or annuli. These coordinates are packaged in the vector ⃗Q of position variables and the vector ⃗P of conjugate
momentum variables with elements
⃗Q = (2L12, 2L13, 2L14, 2L15, 2L23, 2L24, 2L25, 2L34, 2L35, 2L45, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5)⊤,
⃗P = (T12, T13, T14, T15, T23, T24, T25, T34, T35, T45, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5)⊤.
