Figure 12: Numerically obtained deformation of the solid material at ˆ𝑡= 0.25 s,
normalized by the maximum deformation. Left panel: deformation along the direction
perpendicular to the canal centre-line (in the model’s coordinate system this is along 𝑟).
We plot the membrane limit, 𝑏→0 (dashed black line) and the plate limit 𝑏→∞(dotted
line) for comparison. Middle panel: deformation in the direction parallel to the centreline
(i.e. along 𝑠). Note the small change in deformation along 𝑠, suggesting a plate equation
model that only tracks the deformation of the centre of the cupula is appropriate. Right
panel: deformation at the centre of the cupula plotted as a function of the Young’s
modulus.
solution of the plate case (𝑏→∞) with pinned boundary conditions. This solution does not
match the numerical solution either, even if it has a finite gradient at the boundary. Following
physical intuition and previous work (Rabbitt & Damiano 1992), we have opted to present
the clamped solution in the main text.
In the left panel fig. A we plot the normalized deformation, and we observe all curves
collapse. This indicates the deformation regime is linear and motivates the use of a linear
plate equation in the theoretical model of the main text. In the second plot, we see that
the deformation only varies by around 2% in the direction parallel to the centreline. Again,
this is consistent with the use of a linear plate equation where only the deformation of the
centre plane of the cupula is tracked. (The forcing used to generate Figure 12 is that given
by (3.19).) Finally, we note that the magnitude of the deformation is inversely proportional
to the stiffness 𝐸, as can be seen in Figure 12 (right panel).
Appendix B. Numerical procedure for integro-differential equations
When the Stokes number of the flow is no longer negligible, the deformation of the cupula
satisfies (5.7), which is a Volterra integro-integral equation(Polianin & Manzhirov 1998),
and so may be solved numerically using the trapezoidal method. For small values of the
Stokes number this solution procedure requires an increasingly fine temporal discretization,
making the problem computationally intensive. Therefore, an alternative numerical scheme
is required.
Integral equations with exponential Kernels can be transformed into systems of ODEs by
introducing additional variables (Wazwaz 2011); although the kernel K(𝑥, St) in (5.7) is not
strictly exponential, it may be seen as a linear combination of exponential Kernels. To this
end, we may define a sequence of auxiliary variables
