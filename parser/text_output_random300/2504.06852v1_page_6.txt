FIG. 1: Ferromagnetic Kagome (a) and Hexagonal (b)
lattice in real space. a1 and a2 are basis vectors in real
space. The DM vectors Dij = Dνijez are parallel to the
z axis, in which ez represents the unit vector pointing in
the positive direction of the z axis. As shown in the
figure, νij = 1 along the orange arrows. Here, i and j
represent the nearest lattice points in (a) and represent
the next-nearest neighbor lattice point in (b).
in which H11(k) = H22(k) = H33(k) = 4JS −gJµBBz,
H12(k) = −2(J + iD)S cos(k · δ1), H13(k) = −2(J −
iD)S cos(k · δ2) and H23(k) = −2(J + iD)S cos(k · (δ2 −
δ1)). Here, δ1 = 1

In Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, we plot the change of magnon spin
photoconductivity and magnon energy photoconductiv-
ity with optical frequency at different relaxation times,
where the optical frequency is in about infrared range.
As shown in Fig. 2 (a) and (b), when the relaxation
time is 10−9 s, 10−10 s and 10−11 s, the longitudinal
magnon spin photoconductivity χxx(ω) (including the
real part and the imaginary part), as the increase of op-
tical frequency, increases rapidly at first, and decreases
rapidly after it reaches a peak, and then changes slowly.
And as shown in Fig. 2 (c), when the relaxation time
is 10−9 s, 10−10 s, 10−11 s and 10−12 s, the real part
of transverse magnon spin photoconductivity increase
rapidly at first, then turn to remaining relatively stable.
When the relaxation time is 10−13, the real part of trans-
verse magnon spin photoconductivity increase with opital
frequency in the far infrared range. In Fig. 2 (d), when
the relaxation is 10−9 s, 10−10 s, 10−11 s and 10−12 s, as
the increase of optical frequency, the imaginary of trans-
verse magnon spin photoconductivity decrease rapidly at
first, then increase and turn to remaining relatively sta-
ble. When the relaxation time is 10−13 s, the magnon
spin photoconductivity decrease with the increase of the
optical frequency. On the whole, the magnon spin photo-
conductivity with relaxation time of 10−12 s and 10−13 s
scales are relatively low, because the lower relaxing time
leads to a higher Γ, which reduces the overall magnitude
of Eq. 17.

FIG. 2: Waterfall plot of the change of the magnon spin
photoconductivity with optical frequency under
different relaxation times, where the optical frequency is
in about infrared range. Here, we take J = 1 meV,
D = 0.32 meV, S = 1 and gJµBBz = −3 meV. The
waterfall plot describe the real part of longitudinal
magnon spin photoconductivity (a), the imaginary part
of longitudinal magnon spin photoconductivity (b), the
real part of transverse magnon spin photoconductivity
(c) and the imaginary part of transverse magnon spin
photoconductivity (d).
The shapes of the curves in Fig. 3 and Fig. 2 are very
similar, because the difference between Eq. 17 and Eq.
21 is mainly the intrinsic property of the Brillouin zone,
instead of the optical frequency and the relaxing time.
So we won’t go into the details of Fig. 3.
So in the frequency range that we calculate, we can
get the maximum value of magnon spin (energy) pho-
toconductivity in the range of roughly 0.03 × 1013 to
2.5225 × 1013 rad/s.
According to Eq.
24, in this
range, we can expect to find the strongest magnon photo-
