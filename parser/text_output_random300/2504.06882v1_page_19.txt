FIG. S7: (a) and (b) show two equivalent ways to define ν(2) over M2.
Example 2: Dicosm M5
The second example is the k-space P21. Consider the two kx-kz planes with ky = 0 and ky = π. As illustrated
in Fig. S8(a), the two boundaries S±
1 (S±
2 ) of X1(X2) are transformed into each other by a 2-fold screw rotation
symmetry R2. Therefore, we can define two Z2 invariants, expressed as:
ν(2)
0
= 1
2π
Z
X1
f −1
π
Z
S+
1
a,
ν(2)
π
= 1
2π
Z
X2
f −1
π
Z
S+
2
a.
(S79)
By continuously deforming X1 along ky while keeping its two boundaries related by the screw rotation symmetry, we
eventually deform X+
1 into X′
1, as shown in Fig. S8(b). It is evident that ν(2)
0
is just ν(2)
1
as defined in Eq. (S64).
The sub-manifold X′
1 + X2 + M is periodic in kz, and the integration of flux over this sub-manifold gives a value
that is a multiple of 2π. We can then derive:
ν(2)
0
+ ν(2)
π
= 1

X1+X2

mod 2.

This shows that ν(2)
0
and ν(2)
π
are equal if the Chern number over M is even, and unequal if the Chern number is odd.
A similar argument holds for the Z2 invariants defined on the ky-kz planes with kx = 0 and kx = π, which corresponds
to ν(2)
1
as defined in Eq. (S64). Therefore, there are only two independent Z2 invariants and one independent Chern
number in this case.
