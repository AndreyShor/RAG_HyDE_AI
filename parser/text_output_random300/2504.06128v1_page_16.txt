In particular, by (2.24), condition (2.20) is satisfied when φN is the uniform distribution
on a ball or when φN is the random walk transition kernel, see (1.23) and (1.14):

Corollary 2.9. Let βN be in the quasi-critical regime (1.22) and recall δN from (1.24). For

the assumptions of Theorem 2.5 are verified and we obtain (2.26) from (2.21).

3. Proofs for the SHF
In this section, we prove our main results for the SHF. More precisely, we prove
‚ Theorem 1.1 (singularity) in Subsection 3.1;
‚ Theorem 1.2 (log-normality) in Subsection 3.2;
‚ Theorem 1.4 (long-time behavior) in Subsection 3.3;
‚ Theorem 1.5 (regularity) in Subsection 3.4, alongside the corresponding Theorem 1.7
for directed polymers.
We first state a basic monotonicity result. For integrable φ : R2 Ñ R, we will write
Z ϑ
t pφq :“
ż
R2 φpxq Z ϑ
t pdxq,
which is well-defined and has mean
ş
R2 φpxq dx.
Lemma 3.1 (Convex monotonicity for the SHF). Fix t ą 0 and a positive integrable
function φ : R2 Ñ R`. The law of Z ϑ
t pφq is increasing in ϑ w.r.t. the convex order, i.e.,
for any convex function Ψ : R Ñ R, we have
E

ď E

Ψ

Z ϑ

for ϑ1 ă ϑ ,
(3.1)
and the reverse inequality holds for concave Ψ.
In particular, fractional moments of the SHF are decreasing in ϑ:
