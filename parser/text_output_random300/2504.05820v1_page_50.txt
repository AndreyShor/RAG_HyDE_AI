Figure 2.2: Comparison of selected solutions strategies, with respect to the iterated-exact (called
exa in label) one. In particular: perturbative-exact (pexa) (matching the reference in the non-singlet
sector), iterated-expanded (exp), and truncated (trn). The distributions are evolved in the range
µF = 1.65 →102 GeV, with same plotting settings as in Fig. 2.1.
• iterate-expanded: In the singlet sector we follow the strategy of iterate-exact. In the
non-singlet sector we expand Eq. (1.75) first to the order specified, before solving the
equations.
• truncated: In both sectors, singlet and non-singlet, we make an ansatz to determine the
solution as a transformation U(as) of the LO solution and then expand the transformation
U up to the order specified (see [119, Eq. 2.24]). Note that for programs using x-space this
strategy is difficult to pursue as the LO solution is kept exact and only the transformation
U is expanded.
The strategies differ mostly in the small-x region where the PDF evolution is enhanced and the
treatment of sub-leading corrections become relevant. This feature is seen prominently in the
singlet sector between iterate-exact (the reference strategy) and truncated. On contrary, in
the non-singlet sector the distributions vanish for small-x and so the difference can be artificially
enhanced. This is eventually the source of the spread visible for the valence distribution V (x)
making it more sensitive to the initial PDF.
Matching at thresholds.
EKO can perform calculations in a fixed flavor number scheme where
the number of active or light flavors nf is constant and in a variable flavor number scheme
(VFNS) where the number of active flavors changes when the scale µ2
F crosses a threshold µ2
h.
The latter requires a matching procedure as explained in Section 1.4.2. Although the value of µh
usually coincides with the respective quark mass mh, EKO implements the explicit expressions
when the two scales do not match. This variation can be used to estimate MHOU.
In Fig. 2.3 we show the relative difference for the PDF evolution with threshold values µ2
h that
do not coincide with the respective heavy quark masses m2
h. When matching at a lower scale
the difference is significantly more pronounced as the evolution includes a region where the
