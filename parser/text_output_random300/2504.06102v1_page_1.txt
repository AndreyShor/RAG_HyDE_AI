Abstract
Physically distributed components and legacy protocols make the
protection of power grids against increasing cyberattack threats
challenging. Infamously, the 2015 and 2016 blackouts in Ukraine
were caused by cyberattacks, and the German Federal Office for In-
formation Security (BSI) recorded over 200 cyber incidents against
the German energy sector between 2023 and 2024. Intrusion detec-
tion promises to quickly detect such attacks and mitigate the worst
consequences. However, public datasets of realistic scenarios are
vital to evaluate these systems. This paper introduces Sherlock, a
dataset generated with the co-simulator Wattson. In total, Sher-
lock covers three scenarios with various attacks manipulating the
process state by injecting malicious commands or manipulating
measurement values. We additionally test five recently-published
intrusion detection systems on Sherlock, highlighting specific
challenges for intrusion detection in power grids. Dataset and doc-
umentation are available at https://sherlock.wattson.it/.

Introduction
Cyberattacks against critical infrastructures, such as power grids,
are on the rise [3, 22]. These attacks typically exploit vulnerabil-
ities in the underlying Industrial Control System (ICS) networks,
which are known to rely on insecure legacy communication pro-
tocols [15, 23]. To make matters worse, such legacy protocols are
difficult to replace due to long lifecycles of industrial hardware,
stringent availability requirements, and limited update capabilities.
Under these circumstances, feasible preventive security measures,
such as network segmentation and firewalls, do not suffice for
protection [7]. Effective intrusion detection promises to identify
cyberattacks in their early stages and thus enable timely counter-
measures that prevent severe damage. Industrial Intrusion Detec-
tion Systems (IIDSs) are thus widely recognized as a retrofittable,
non-disruptive, and promising security solution, serving as the last
line of defense for critical infrastructure [20]. However, such IIDSs
must deal with the unique characteristics of power grid networks.
Traditional network-based IIDSs detect suspicious activities by
scanning traffic for known attack patterns [19]. However, ICS net-
works are often exposed to unknown attacks due to their distinct
characteristics and the use of a wide range of different protocols.
Meanwhile, the predictable nature of control and sensor traffic,
closely tied to underlying physical processes, creates opportunities
for process-aware intrusion detection [7]. Here, the core idea is
to examine a system’s physical state using data transmitted over
the network to detect anomalies. However, this approach necessi-
tates domain-specific training data as a prerequisite for accurately
modeling the expected system behavior.
This relatively new research area is experiencing significant
growth, with at least 130 new process-aware intrusion detection
mechanisms proposed in 2021 alone [20]. However, progress is
hindered by a lack of high-quality datasets: fewer than half of
publications use public datasets, and only 16.4 % utilize more than
one. Within critical infrastructures, the energy sector faces a no-
table dataset gap, as most existing datasets primarily represent
small-scale networks or individual components [2, 8, 32]. Conse-
quently, no comprehensive dataset is currently available for evalu-
ating process-aware intrusion detection in power grid networks.
