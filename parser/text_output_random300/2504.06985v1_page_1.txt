Abstract: The chiral worldvolume theory of an M-theory boundary (the so-called M9 brane)
is uniquely determined by supersymmetry and anomaly inflow. In this brief note we investi-
gate whether alternative chiral boundary field contents may be allowed by anomaly cancella-
tion once supersymmetry is dropped. Even then, anomaly inflow places stringent constraints
on the gauge group G and matter content of the boundary worldvolume theory, which we
determine explicitly. We find the most general solution to these constraints in the case where
all matter fields are of the same chirality, for all simple Lie algebras except sp2, sun≤5, and
son with 7 ≤n ≤12, and find no solutions other than the supersymmetric E8 boundary of
Hoˇrava and Witten. However, when we extend our search to allow for any chirality in the
matter fields, we find one minimal solution with gauge group G2, charged matter in the 14, 27
and 77 representations, which satisfies all constraints in a non-trivial way. Therefore, it could
in principle describe the low-energy theory of a novel nonsupersymmetric M-theory boundary
condition, different from the Hoˇrava-Witten proposal. We briefly discuss some consequences
if this was indeed the case, such as the existence of a non-supersymmetric, exotic “G2-string”
CFT in 6d, and a novel, non-perturbative, heterotic-like 10d string with gauge group G2×G2.
