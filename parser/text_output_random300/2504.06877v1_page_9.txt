Figure 4: Frequency-preserving admittance component YJ,0(ω) of a driven symmetric
Josephson junction. The temperature of the superconducting leads is kBTs = 0.04∆Σ,
drive frequency is ħhΩ= 0.155∆Σ. (a, b) Real and imaginary components of the
admittance for the drive amplitude eV0 = 0.5∆Σ. The vertical black dotted lines
highlight logarithmic singularities of the admittance at frequencies ω = ±∆Σ/ħh+nΩ,
where n is (a) odd (b) even integer number. (c, d) Real component of admittance as
a function of frequency and drive amplitude.

In Fig. 3 we show the frequency dependence of the junction admittance for ϕ0 = 0 and ϕ0 = π.
In the former case, we clearly see a 1/ω divergence of the imaginary part of the admittance,
which corresponds to the standard inductive response of a Josephson junction at low frequen-
cies. For the cold junction, the dissipation is suppressed in the range of frequencies ħh|ω| < ∆Σ.
This is not the case for the hot junction, where the thermal quasiparticles lead to emergence of
a logarithmic singularity in the real part of the admittance. For the junction biased to ϕ0 = π,
the inductive component of the response flips its sign as expected. The dissipation at high
frequencies ħh|ω| > ∆Σ turns out to be significantly stronger than in the unbiased case ϕ0 = 0,
which means that Cooper pair breaking happens more efficiently. However, the real part of
the low frequency admittance of the hot π-biased junction is strongly suppressed compared
to the unbiased one, which is explained by the coherent suppression of quasiparticle tunnel-
ing [77, 78]. At arbitrary phase bias ϕ0, neither the Cooper pair breaking nor quasiparticle
tunneling is suppressed, so we have uncompensated dissipation at both high and low frequen-
cies.

Now we proceed to the case of a non-vanishing drive at frequency Ω. The noiseless part of the
current (11) linearized with respect to the probe voltage is given by
