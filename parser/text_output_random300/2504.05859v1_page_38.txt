9. The TR spectrum around the 𝐀𝐀𝐌𝐌 resonance upon electron doping MoSe2.  
 
Figure S10. The TR spectrum around the AM resonance of MoSe2 upon electron 
doping MoSe2. (a-e) Contour plots of the TR spectrum around the AM resonance as a 
function of 𝜏𝜏, with 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷 varying from 0 V to 6.45 V while 𝑉𝑉E fixed at 0 V. (f) The 
normalized dynamics of the AM  resonance, which are extracted from the dip 
magnitude of the TR spectrum. The dashed line denotes a two-exponential fitting. (g) 
The rise time constant of the AM resonance as a function of 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷, obtained from the 
fitting in (f).
