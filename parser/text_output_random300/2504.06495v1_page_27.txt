function of the Gaussian increment exactly oﬀsets the drift term.

Further discussion and remarks
The previous two subsections introduced our generalized branching models in both discrete
and continuous time and established their key mathematical implications in Theorems 2
and 3. We now provide some additional context and clariﬁcation.
Remarks on the discrete time model
For the discrete-time model in (11), we assume that the random multipliers ∆t are indepen-
dent and identically distributed over t, which entails two assumptions:
(i) Stationarity: The distribution of ∆t is assumed to not depend on t. This is a natural
assumption in a stationary physical environment.
(ii) Independence: The process is deﬁned over discrete time steps t ∈{0, 1, 2, . . .} cor-
responding to equidistant points in physical time τt. If the time interval τt −τt−1 is
small, assuming independence between ∆t and ∆t−1 may be unrealistic. However, by
choosing this interval suﬃciently large, the independence assumption becomes increas-
ingly reasonable. This ﬂexibility in time scale selection provides our main justiﬁcation
for treating the ∆t as independent in our formal results above. However, as should be
plausible from the heuristic proof of Theorem 2, the results remain valid under certain
forms of weak dependence: As long as the sequence (log(∆t) : t = 1, 2, 3, . . .) satisﬁes
a central limit theorem (CLT) of the form

∗),
for some asymptotic variance σ2
∗, then the key conclusions of the model still hold, one
just needs to replace the σ2 by σ2
∗to account for autocorrelation in ∆t. We chose not
to incorporate autocorrelation into our formal results, as doing so would have further
complicated the presentation without aﬀecting the main insights.
