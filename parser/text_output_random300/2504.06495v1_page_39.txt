From our previous results, we know that P(Xτ ̸= −∞| B = k) ∼C · δk for large τ, where C
is a constant that does not depend on k. Since P(B = k) = 1/K for all k, the denominator
is also proportional to P
k δk = 1, and we obtain the corollary.
At ﬁrst glance, the probabilistic result in Corollary 1 may seem at odds with our argument
in Subsection 2.2, where we rejected the need to postulate probabilities over measurement
outcomes. However, in that earlier discussion we also introduced the idea of a “pragmatic”
interpretation — assigning equal subjective probability across decoherent branches. This
pragmatic stance is precisely what we adopt here, and it leads directly to the Born rule as a
conditional probability statement in Corollary 1.
Next, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the conditional median of X0 as τ →∞.
Before considering the full measurement setup described by (A), (B), (C), it is helpful to
consider a simpler result for the continuous-time process deﬁned in (18) on its own. Assuming
that this process has reached its steady state distribution in Theorem 4 by time τ = 0, one
ﬁnds that, as τ →∞,
Med(X0 | Xτ ̸= −∞) = log(ǫ) + log(2) + σ2
µ log(τ) + o(1),
(29)
where the remainder term o(1) denotes a function that converges to zero as τ →∞. The re-
sult in (29) follows from the observation that, conditional on survival until τ, the distribution
of X0 converges to a shifted Gamma distribution whose scale parameter grows like log(τ).
In fact, an analogous asymptotic expression holds for any other conditional quantile of X0;
the term log(2) in the leading expression would simply be replaced by a diﬀerent constant
depending on the quantile level.
The result in (29) is signiﬁcant for our purposes because it reveals that, conditional
on survival until large τ, we obtain not only the Born rule as stated in Corollary 1, but
also the additional insight that the typical past value of the diﬀerence X0 −log ǫ increases
proportionally to log(τ). In other words, after macroscopic times τ, the conditional value
of X0 should be expected to be well above the threshold log ǫ. This explains why violations
of the Schr¨odinger equation due to small-signal truncation are not constantly observed in
