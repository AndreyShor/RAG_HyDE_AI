Exploiting first the scaling relation (3.13) with ϑ replaced by ϑ ´ log a and a “ t´1, and
then the monotonicity of fractional moments (3.2), we obtain for all t ě 1

3.4. Improved convergence and regularity of the SHF. Theorem 1.7
entails that, almost surely, Z ϑ
t
P C´ε for every ε ą 0, hence Theorem 1.5 follows (delta
measures δx in Rd are in Cγ only for γ ď ´d, hence Z ϑ
t is non-atomic).
The rest of this subsection is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.7. We first recall the
definition of negative Hölder spaces (see [FM17, Section 2] or [CZ20, Section 12] for more
details). Let us introduce some notation in any dimension d P N.
‚ Let C8
c denote the family of smooth and compactly supported functions φ : Rd Ñ R.
‚ For r P N0 “ t0, 1, 2, . . .u, let Cr
c denote the family of compactly supported functions
of class Cr, for which we define
}φ}Cr :“

d φ}8 .
‚ Let Br denote the family of functions φ P C8
c supported on Bp0, 1q with }φ}Cr ď 1.
‚ Given a function φ : Rd Ñ R, we denote by φλ
x its λ-scaled version centred at x:
φλ
xp¨q :“ λ´d φ
`
λ´1p ¨ ´ xq
˘
for x P Rd, λ ą 0 .
Definition 3.4 (Negative Hölder spaces). Given γ ă 0, the negative Hölder space Cγ
is the family of linear functionals T : C8
c Ñ R with the following property: for any K P N,
there is a constant cK ă 8 such that
|Tpφλ
xq| ď cK λγ
@x P Bp0, Kq, λ P p0, 1s, φ P Br,
(3.16)
where r “ rpγq :“ t´γ ` 1u (any integer r ą ´γ would yield an equivalent definition).
Any distribution T P Cγ can be canonically extended (by continuity) from C8
c to Cr
c , for
any integer r ą ´γ, hence we can consider Tpφq for φ P Cr
c . In order to prove that T P Cγ,
it turns out that it is enough to check property (3.16) for a finite family of 2d well-chosen
test functions φ P Cr
c : a so-called wavelet basis [FM17, Section 2], which we denote by
ϕ
and
␣
ψpiq(
1ďiă2d
(which satisfy
ş
Rd ψpiqpxq dx “ 0) .
(3.17)
(The details of such functions are immaterial for our goals.)
This yields a convenient criterion for a sequence pT ω
N qNPN of random distributions to be
tight in the Hölder space Cγ with γ ă 0 (in the spirit of the classical Kolmogorov moment
criterion for γ ą 0). The following is a special case of [FM17, Theorem 2.30].
Theorem 3.5 (Tightness criterion for negative Hölder spaces). Fix γ ă 0 and an
integer r ą ´γ. Let tϕ, ψpiq : 1 ď i ă 2du be a Cr
c wavelet basis in Rd, see (3.17).
Let pT ω
N qNPN be a sequence of random linear forms on Cr
c , that is, for every ω in a
probability space pΩ, A, Pq and every N P N, we have a linear functional T ω
N : Cr
c Ñ R, such
that ω ÞÑ T ω
N pφq is a random variable for every φ P Cr
c .
