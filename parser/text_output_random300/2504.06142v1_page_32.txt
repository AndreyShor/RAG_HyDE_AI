Cosmic Strings from intermediate scale spontaneous symme-
try breaking and proton decay constraints
Historically, the first important test for every GUT is proton decay. While it has not yet
been observed, the proton lifetime has been at the center of many experimental searches
[99–102], which severely constrain it and, in turn, the unification scale. Most of the breaking
directions of the SO(10) GUT are rigorously tested by Super-Kamiokande (Super-K), while
future experiments -like Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) [103], DUNE [104] and JUNO [105]-
will improve sensitivity by even one order of magnitude. Given the predictions of many GUTs
(lifetime below 1036 years), the above-mentioned experiments could be getting very close to
the proton decay discovery and, consequently, baryon number violation. This would be a
significant milestone for theoretical particle physics and it would also exclude many attempts
to grand unification.
However, proton decay is not the only way to probe GUTs in current and near future
experiments. When the GUT gauge symmetry or any of the intermediate gauge structures
break spontaneously towards the SM, they produce topological defects. Some of them, namely
domain walls and monopoles, dominate the energy density of the Universe, and are therefore
considered problematic. This problem can fortunately go away with the assumption that
inflation takes place after their production, as it suppresses their density strongly. A third
type of defect, cosmic strings, which are formed from the breaking of an abelian U(1) subgroup
(although in some cases larger subgroups can result in cosmic strings), do not present such
a problem, as a cosmic string network has a scaling solution and thus does not overclose
the Universe. It can survive, though, and generate a source of gravitational radiation [106–
108].
