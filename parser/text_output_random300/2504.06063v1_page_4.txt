The currently available experimental results [3, 4] provide
the fully-inclusive decay rate Γ ≡Γ[Ds 7→Xℓ¯νℓ] which
is the sum,
Γ = |Vcs|2Γ¯cs + |Vcd|2Γ¯cd + |Vus|2Γ¯us ,
(6)
of the contributions corresponding to the different flavor
channels. In this work, however, we also provide separate
results for all of the contributions, i.e. for the dominant
channel Γ¯cs as well as for the Cabibbo-suppressed chan-
nels Γ¯cd and Γ¯us.
Each contribution to the decay rate can be written as

where GF is the Fermi constant and SEW = 1.013 ac-
counts for the logarithmic electroweak correction [28] and
for the QED threshold corrections2 that have been com-
puted in Ref. [29]. In this work, we perform an isoQCD
calculation and neglect long-distance isospin breaking ef-
fects. We define the leptonic tensor as

where ϵαβγδ is the totally antisymmetric four-index Levi–
Civita symbol, with ϵ0123 = 1. The so-called hadronic
tensor, which is in fact an hadronic spectral density, is
expressed by
Hµν(p, ω) = (2π)4

where P = (H, P ) is the QCD four-momentum oper-
ator.
Based on Lorentz and time-reversal covariance,
Hµν(p, ω) can be decomposed into five form-factors,

which, in our convention, are real and dimensionless. In

ligible w.r.t. the dominant Γ¯cs and the Cabibbo-suppressed Γ¯cd
contributions. This allows us to ignore the fact that QED thresh-
old corrections are different in the ¯us channel and, therefore, to
use the same SEW factor for all channels.
the rest-frame of the Ds meson the dependence of the
form-factors upon the scalars p · ω and ω2 can be traded
for the dependence upon the variables (ω0, ω2). There-
fore, by omitting the dependence upon p2 = m2
Ds, we
have
h(i) ≡h(i)(ω0, ω2) ,
i = 1, · · · , 5 .

In order to express the form-factors in terms of the differ-
ent components of the hadronic tensor, i.e. to invert the
system of Eq. (10), we consider the two unit vectors ˆnr
that are orthonormalized and orthogonal to ˆω = ω/|ω|,
i.e.
ˆnr · ˆns = δrs ,
ˆnr · ˆω = 0 ,

The leptonic tensor in Eq. (8) differs (is larger) by a factor 4
with respect to the one that was given in Ref. [11, Eq. (2.3)].
The hadronic tensor was denoted as Wµν in Ref. [11] and we
have the correspondence Hµν = 2πWµν. The correspondence be-
tween the hadronic form factors of Eq. (10) and those of Ref. [11]
is h(1) = −2πmDsW1, h(2) = 2πmDsW2, h(3) = 2πmDsW4,
h(4) = 2πmDsW5, h(5) = −2πmDsW3. Finally, the relations be-
tween the Y(i) quantities defined here and the quantities denoted
as Y (i) in Ref. [11, Eq. (2.9)] are Y(1) = Y (1)/2, Y(2) = Y (2),
Y(3) = Y (3), Y(4) = Y (4)/2, and Y(5) = Y (5).
