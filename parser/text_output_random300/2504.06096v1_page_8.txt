The hardware hadron trigger efficiencies, for both signal and normalisation channels, are
evaluated with two methods: the Tistos method [64,65] in data, using the normalisation
channel, and independent estimates based on control samples in data, obtained with
similar methods as in Ref. [66]; from the comparison of the two methods a 12% relative
systematic uncertainty is assigned. The hardware muon trigger efficiencies for the signal
are evaluated similarly to Refs. [67,68]. There, given the lack of other low-pT calibration
channels, the K0
S →πµν channel was used, with the pion decaying in flight into a muon.
In this analysis, the K+ →π+π−π+ channel is used, where two opposite-sign pions are
identified as muons. Following Refs. [67, 68], a systematic uncertainty is assigned to
the TOS sample which includes data-simulation agreement and the method verification,
and amounts to 22%. The efficiency of the TIS hardware trigger category is estimated
with Σ+ →pπ0 decays in data with the Tistos method and corrected for the residual
correlation with the decay kinematics. A systematic uncertainty of 6% is assigned.
The efficiency of the requirement on the BDT output is calibrated directly on
Σ+ →pµ+µ−decays by comparing the data and simulation distribution above the chosen
value. To account for the small disagreement between data and simulation, the data
distribution is extrapolated to lower BDT output values to obtain an efficiency correction
for the simulation. The distribution is well described by a first-order polynomial, however
a second-order is also employed with the difference assigned as a systematic uncertainty.
The yield of the Σ+ →pπ0 channel is obtained through an unbinned maximum-
likelihood fit to the distribution of the corrected mass, defined as mCorr ≡mpγγ −mγγ +
mPDG
π0
. Here, mpγγ is the invariant mass of the proton and two photons, mγγ that of the
two photons from which the π0 is reconstructed, and mPDG
π0
is the known π0 mass [38].
The Σ+ →pπ0 probability distribution function is composed of the sum of a Gaussian
and a Crystal Ball function [69], with power-law tails on both sides. The background
component is described by a Chebyshev second-degree polynomial of the first kind. The
Σ+ →pπ0 tail parameters are obtained from simulation, while the remaining parameters
are free in the fit. The distribution of mCorr is shown in Fig. 3; a total of (6.13±0.10)×103
and (4.746 ± 0.031) × 104 Σ+ →pπ0 candidates is obtained for the TOS and TIS
samples, respectively. With Eq. (1), the single-event sensitivities of the two samples are
αTOS = (1.65 + 0.09
−0.16
+ 0.41
−0.41) × 10−10 and αTIS = (6.81 + 0.29
−0.25
+ 0.85
−0.85) × 10−11, respectively, where
the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.
The fit to the Σ+ →pµ+µ−invariant-mass distribution is repeated separately for the
TOS and TIS samples, with total yields of 96 ± 10 and 154 ± 13, respectively. These
correspond to the measured branching fractions BTOS = (1.59 + 0.19
−0.23
+ 0.40
−0.40) × 10−8 and
BTIS = (1.05 + 0.10
−0.10
+ 0.13
−0.13) × 10−8, respectively, where the first uncertainty is statistical and
the second systematic. The two branching fractions are then combined as a weighted
average, factorising common efficiencies to take correlations into account. The resulting
branching fraction is
B(Σ+ →pµ+µ−) = (1.08 ± 0.17) × 10−8,
where the uncertainty includes statistical and systematic sources.
This result is in
agreement with the SM predictions [1–3]. The combination with the value obtained in
Run 1 [35], which has a large uncertainty, results in B(Σ+ →pµ+µ−) = (1.09±0.17)×10−8.
In summary, the Σ+ →pµ+µ−decay is observed with very high significance in
data collected in Run 2 by the LHCb experiment in pp collisions, with a yield of
