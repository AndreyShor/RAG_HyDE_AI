population inversion—achieved in situ by bubbling parahydrogen (para-H2) into a liquid containing
the activated SABRE catalyst (SABRE = signal amplification by reversible exchange), Fig. 1C,
(19, 23). The catalyst enables spontaneous polarization transfer in situ at zero field, creating 𝐽-
transition population imbalances in target molecules (24,25). Details of the para-H2 gas handling
are given in the Supporting Information (SI, Material and Methods).
External programmable feedback loop
A central challenge in implementing zero-field quantum oscillators arises from the absence of radi-
ation damping. In ultralow-field raser experiments—also lacking radiation damping—researchers
have relied on external feedback loops (26). Typically, these feedback loops detect precessing mag-
netization using optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) (27), and subsequently feed signals back
into the sample through coils orthogonal to the measurement axis (28). However, such feedback
scheme cannot be directly adopted to zero-field 𝐽-oscillators. This is because coherent amplifica-
tion of the Δ𝑚= 0 transitions requires that the feedback magnetic field is applied along the same
measurement axis (𝑦-axis, (22)).
To resolve this, we developed an external feedback loop, implemented via software control
without need for specialized hardware modifications as schematically depicted in Fig. 1A. In our
implementation, an OPM detects the 𝑦- cartesian component of the magnetic field generated by the
sample (𝐵OPM). This signal is processed digitally, allowing precise control of both a tunable external
feedback delay (𝜏) and feedback gain (𝐺ext). The processed feedback signal is reapplied to the
sample (𝐵ext, along the 𝑦-axis) using a piercing solenoid (29). The piercing solenoid configuration
inherently avoids feedback field leakage into the OPM sensor ensuring that measured signals are
exclusively generated by the sample.
Stability of quantum oscillations
The quantum oscillator was initially tested on a model system consisting of 5 % [15N]-acetonitrile
([15N]-ACN) dissolved in acetonitrile (ACN) solvent (23,25). The feedback configuration enables
spontaneous emergence of the quantum oscillator, as demonstrated in Fig. 1D with a feedback
delay of 𝜏= 222 ms and gain 𝐺ext = +20, requiring no pulse excitation. Likely, the electronic noise
