current g1 and g1/F1 (DIS NC), Drell-Yan asymmetries (DY CC), single-inclusive jet and dijet
asymmetries. We display result at different perturbative orders with and without MHOU
computed with the methodology discussed in Section 5.1.2.

Figure 5.6: The LO, NLO, NNLO NNPDFPOL2.0 PDFs at Q = 100 GeV. We display the gluon ∆g, the
total singlet ∆Σ and total valence ∆V PDFs. Error bands correspond to one sigma PDF uncertainties
including MHOUs.
value both for the singlet and gluon PDFs. The size of the uncertainties at NNLO and NLO is
comparable in most of the cases, except for the small-x singlet, where we see a quite broad
enlargement of the PDF error in the NNLO fits (independently of the presence of MHOUs).
This behavior has been also observed in a similar study [333] and seems to be originated by
somehow poorer control of the down-like quarks small-x polarization. Although the origin of
this behavior is not yet clear, it might be interesting to see if this effects is an artifact related to
the inclusion of NNLO corrections in the W-asymmetries via K-factors.
