Supplementary Figure 11: Opacity proﬁles for secondary contributors at the base of the solar
convective zone on the seismic thermodynamical path for both the OP and SCO-RCG codes.
Left panel: contributions of sulfur, nickel and argon. Right panel: contributions of hydrogen,
magnesium, silicon, carbon, helium and nitrogen.

Comparing OPAS, OP and OPLIB in Supplementary Fig. 12, we ﬁnd that the differences are
much smaller than in Supplementary Fig. 11. In general, OPAS opacities will be smaller than
the OP ones. OPLIB and OPAS tend to agree for all lighter elements up to Nitrogen, but
systematically lower opacities are found for heavier elements. The differences between OPAS
and OP are particularly apparant in hydrogen and sulfur, while nickel shows some deviations
in OP at the BCZ. This is not completelely unexpected as nickel was extrapolated from iron
data in OP, but OPLIB and OPAS are not in good agreement for this element either, calling
for further investigations. We observed the same pattern for hydrogen and helium, namely
that helium seems to match very well between OP, OPLIB and OPAS, but hydrogen shows
signiﬁcant deviations throughout the structure, with OP having systematically higher values
