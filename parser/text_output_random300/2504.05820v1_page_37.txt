Table 1.3: Overview of the unpolarized DIS coefficients currently available in literature at the corre-
sponding order in perturbative QCD. In the columns we distinguish between light, heavy
and intrinsic. We mark in green coefficient function that are implemented in Yadism (see
Section 2.1.2), in red the ones which are not yet known and in yellow the ones which are not
yet implemented in Yadism, but available in literature.

and unpolarized case. For each perturbative order and process, we distinguish contributions
from light-to-light (light), light-to-heavy (heavy) and heavy-to-light or heavy-to-heavy (intrinsic)
coefficients.
Lastly, we can note that when including NNLO or higher corrections, massive quarks can also
contribute to Eq. (1.93) with diagrams where the electroweak boson is coupling to a light
fermionic line. Such contributions, are not included in the heavy coefficient function, but
need to be taken into account in the total structure function. Currently, they are known only
up to NNLO [26]. In summary when considering heavy quarks effects the total inclusive
structure functions are given by an incoherent sum over all the light, heavy and intrinsic partons
