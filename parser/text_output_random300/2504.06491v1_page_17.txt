incident energy Ei is actually Ei + δ, where δ is some deviation that may be positive or negative. From the time of
flight geometry, we can calculate the effect of this deviation δ on the detected ∆E from an elastic scattering event
according to the function

At the CNCS instrument, d1=36.25 m and d2=3.75 m. Figure 3 below shows this relationship and the FWHM of δ
given our chosen incident energy and chopper speed. Note that it is nearly linear in our regime of interest.
FIG. 3.
Detected ∆E as a function of incident neutron energy deviation δ according to Equation 3 given CNCS instrument
geometry and incident neutron energy Ei=3.32 meV. The shaded region shows the reported FWHM for δ at the CNCS for the
180Hz DD-chopper frequency used in our experiments.
Alone, Equation 3 accounts for the “bleeding” of elastic Bragg features into the inelastic signal, but does not explain
the chiral nature of the artifacts. This quality comes from the combination of Equations 2 and 3, which shows that
a non-zero δ also affects the detected q position of elastic scattering events. Specifically, an elastic Bragg scattering
event that should be detected at
q = k(Ei)

is instead detected at

Using Equations 3 and 5, one can model and track how this process contaminates the detected inelastic data. This is
done in Panel (a) of Figure 9 for extraneous scattering from [1 0 0] and equivalent Bragg peaks at ℏω = [0.3, 0.5] meV.
The intersection of the q = 0 centered circle and the arcs show where the strongest signal from Bragg peaks themselves
appears and the arcs follow the streaking caused by the variance in δ. In the figure chiral artifacts from [2 0 0] equivalent
Bragg peaks also appear, but these are not tracked.
Thankfully, this explained artifact can be removed with the collection of two datasets at different temperatures and
the use of the background subtraction method detailed in the Methods section. Relative to most scattering processes
measured by neutrons, this effect is small in intensity. It only appears in this work because of the weak and diffuse
nature of the signal we measure in our sample.
