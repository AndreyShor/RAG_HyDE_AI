TABLE II: Best-fit constraints on thermal and dark matter model parameters for different analysis at 𝑧= 4.6. Default corresponds to using
Gaussian 𝑇0 priors and mass resolution correction 𝑅𝑠cdm except for the thermal resolution dependent analysis where 𝑅𝑠cdm (𝑢0) is applied
instead. The remaining analysis are additive on top of the default.

𝑘max than in [83]. While the posterior in Figure 6 shrinks due
to the small-scale information available from [69] data, we ex-
pect the high 𝑚−1
WDM regime to achieve a constant plateau. This
arises from the imprint that these light thermal relics (𝑚WDM
< 1 keV) leave on the matter power spectrum, as discussed in
Section III. For large 𝑚−1
WDM, suppression in the matter power
spectrum shifts to lower 𝑘-modes. While the Lyman-𝛼forest
data is sensitive to the mildly non-linear scales, and therefore
not to the free-streaming scale from these light thermal relics,
the plateau reached by these mixed dark matter models shifts
the overall amplitude of 𝑃F(𝑘). This effect is degenerate with
other astrophysical effects, mainly with the mean IGM trans-
mission, 𝜏eff.
The difference between these flux models is
therefore smaller than the error on the data, shown in Figure 3,
meaning that the data will not be sensitive to them.
Con-
sequently, even if additional simulations were run for 𝑚WDM
> 1 keV, we expect the data to maintain the constraint on the
fraction 𝑓WDM at the same level. This is likely true for the mod-
els where the half-mode scale is smaller than 0.05 ℎMpc−1, at
which point marginalising over other cosmological parameters
(e.g. 𝐴𝑠, 𝑛𝑠) would become important.

CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we present updated constraints on CWDM
models using new 1D flux power spectrum measurements from
the high redshift Lyman-𝛼forest provided by [69]. The sta-
tistical power of this data set is limited by cosmic variance
as a result of the small number of QSO sightlines available.
However, the number of sightlines has more than doubled
compared to previous analyses using the same spectrographs,
and the improvement in the systematic modeling provides ac-
cess to scales a factor of ≈2 smaller than those probed in
previous WDM and CWDM constraints. This enables direct
measurement of the flux power spectrum at wavenumbers 𝑘≥
10 ℎMpc−1, precisely where free-streaming effects from the
WDM component are expected to suppress structure formation
in these hybrid models.
Our analysis indicates that a thermal relic with 𝑚WDM = 1
keV is allowed if its contribution to the total dark matter density
does not exceed 16% (2𝜎). For higher mass bins (𝑚WDM =
2, 3, 4 keV), increasingly larger abundances are permitted, with
𝑓WDM = 0.35, 0.50, and 0.67 at 2𝜎. These findings refine
previous constraints from [52], which were based on lower-
resolution SDSS and VHS data, as well as a limited number
of simulations for low 𝑚WDM values. Additionally, our results
align closely with those of [83] on CWDM in the low-𝑚WDM
regime explored by our simulations, with minor differences
arising from variations in thermal history treatment, simulation
runs at lower 𝑚WDM grid points, and improved data from
HIRES.
On the pure WDM side, we also obtain stronger constraints
than previous studies ([52, 70, 114], due to the inclusion of
higher 𝑘-bin information. These constraints remain consis-
tent with those reported by [46], although fiducial analysis
results in slightly weaker lower bounds.
This is primarily
attributed to the extensive sampling required to explore the
high-dimensional parameter space, particularly the degener-
acy between 𝑓WDM and 𝑚−1
WDM. However, in certain analyses,
we derive even more stringent constraints. For instance, the
patchy + 𝑢0 −𝑇0 model yields 𝑚WDM > 5.86 keV compared to
𝑚WDM > 5.10 keV in [46]. This suggests that incorporating
additional physical effects may alleviate the strong degenera-
cies among sampled parameters. Specifically, patchy models
consistently favor scenarios with reduced heat injection, which
may, in turn, enhance the efficiency of likelihood sampling.
Beyond Lyman-𝛼forest analyses, CWDM has also been
constrained by combining BOSS data with Planck and esti-
mates of the number of satellite galaxies [85]. Our constraint
at the lowest mass bin probed in this analysis, 𝑚WDM = 1 keV, is
10% stronger. More recently, [119] demonstrated that the com-
