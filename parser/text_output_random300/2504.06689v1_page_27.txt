The full set of three-loop massless 2 →2 amplitudes is now complete [720–722]. Together
with the NNLOQCD 3j calculation, all amplitude building blocks are available to tackle jet
production at N3LOQCD; a major obstacle here is to devise a formalism that can deal with the
complex IR subtraction for this process at this order.
Inclusive jets can be measured in both ATLAS and CMS with 5% uncertainty in the cross
sections (in the precision range), a precision that requires NNLOQCD cross sections. Global PDF
fits require NNLOQCD calculations of double and even triple differential observables, requiring
the use of full colour predictions. The measurements extend to jet transverse momenta of the
order of 3–5 TeV, necessitating the precise calculation of EW corrections as well. Eventually,
PDFs will be determined at the N3LOQCD level, requiring the use of N3LOQCD predictions for
the input processes, including inclusive jet production, necessitating the calculation of di-jet
production to this order.

≥3j
LH21 status: NNLOQCD corrections for 3-jet with the double-virtual corrections treated in
the leading-colour approximation [184]. NLOQCD corrections for 4-jet [723,724] and 5-jet [725]
known. Full NLOSM calculation for 3-jet production was performed using SHERPA interfaced to
RECOLA in Ref. [726].
Three-jet observables provide a better description of jet shapes, and have the potential for
the determination of the strong coupling constant over an extended dynamic range.

Vector-boson associated processes
An overview of the status of vector-boson associated processes is given in Table 4. If not stated
explicitly, the leptonic decays are assumed. In the same way, the off-shell description is the
default one. Finally, in some cases for V V + 2j, the full NLO corrections are not known, and in
these cases we indicate to which underlying Born contribution the corrections refer.
3.3.1
V
LH21 status: N3LOQCD to the inclusive neutral-current Drell-Yan process [727] and to the
lepton-pair rapidity distribution in the photon-mediated Drell-Yan [231]; N3LOQCD to the in-
clusive charged-current Drell-Yan process [728] and to the rapidity, transverse mass, and the
charge asymmetry [235]; NLOEW corrections known for many years see e.g., Ref. [729] and
references therein; corrections at O(αsα) (N(1,1)LOQCD⊗EW) known for the off-shell neutral pro-
cess [223,730] and the charged process up to the finite two-loop remainder [222]; Several results
for on-shell W or parts of the off-shell calculation for the charged process [296,731,732];
NNLOQCD computations matched to parton shower available using the MiNLO method [733],
SCET resummation [734], the UN2LOPS technique [735], and the MINNLOPS method [736];
N3LOQCD + N3LL accuracy [232,234].
In Ref. [737], a comparative study at NNLOQCD accuracy between several codes has been
conducted. Agreement has been found provided linear power corrections induced by the fiducial
cuts are included for programs relying on phase-space slicing subtraction schemes. It is shown
that symmetric experimental event selection render unstable the fixed-order predictions unless
they are supplemented by resummation. Recommendations for future experimental measure-
ments are made.
In Ref. [236], a new calculation for W production at N3LOQCD has been presented, sup-
plemented with transverse momentum resummation. The authors present results for the total
