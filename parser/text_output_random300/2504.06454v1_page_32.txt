magnetic ﬁeld range. Finally, we addressed future perspectives: understanding the ori-
gin of lattice strain, exploring ﬁner eutectic microstructures, artiﬁcially introducing
nanoscale pinning sites, and enhancing Tc. For practical applications as superconduct-
ing wires, prioritizing improvements in high-ﬁeld Jc performance and investigating the
mechanical properties of HEAs are critical tasks.
