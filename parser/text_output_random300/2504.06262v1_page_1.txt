Paraxial fluids of light are a promising platform for exploring collective phenomena
in a highly tunable environment. These systems, which map the propagation of light
through nonlinear media onto the wavefunction of effective 2D quantum fluids, offer a
complementary approach to traditional platforms such as cold atomic gases or super-
fluid helium. In this review, we present a detailed overview of the theoretical framework
underlying paraxial fluids of light, including the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NLSE)
and its mapping to the 2D+1 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). We explore the hydro-
dynamic formulation of these systems and we provide a comparative analysis of fluids
of light and cold atomic gases, examining key parameters and figures of merit.
We then review the recent experimental advances and the experimental platforms cur-
rently used to realize paraxial fluids of light, including hot atomic vapors, photorefractive
crystals, and thermo-optic media. Additionally, we question the geometry of the system
extending the analogy from 2D+1 to lower or higher dimensions.
Looking forward, we outline the potential future directions for the field, including the
use of laser cooled atoms as nonlinear media, the study of two-component mixtures,
and the exploration of quantum effects beyond the mean-field approximation. These
developments promise to deepen our understanding of quantum fluids and potentially
contribute to advances in quantum technologies.
