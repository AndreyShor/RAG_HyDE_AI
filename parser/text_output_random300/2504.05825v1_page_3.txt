degeneracy, and exchange-correlation effects have been explored in the context of IAWs in e-p-i 
plasma, revealing interesting behaviors [26-30]. 
The Quantum Hydrodynamic (QHD) model has been employed to describe these 
systems, offering a computationally efficient approach by using macroscopic variables and 
simplifying the handling of boundary conditions [31,32]. However, early hydrodynamic models 
for quantum particles, which treated the evolution of spin-up and spin-down states alike, were 
found to violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle [33]. The standard QHD model, while effective, 
does not account for the spin polarization of particles, which limits its accuracy in predicting the 
behaviour of quantum plasmas. This limitation is addressed by, the Separated Spin Evolution 
Quantum Hydrodynamic (SSE-QHD) model which addresses spin-up and spin-down particles as 
separate species of particles [34]. New wave modes have been obtained using this model [35-37]. 
Spin effects also help in better understanding the magnetic field associated with plasma waves, 
which is crucial in both laboratory experiments and astrophysical applications [38,39]. The SSE-
QHD model has thus become a pivotal tool in the study of quantum plasma, offering a more 
comprehensive framework than earlier models [40-56]. 
This paper is devoted to the analysis of coupled dispersion relation for multi-component 
plasmas and the investigation of solitary structures. Section – 2, describes the basic set of 
equations of the SSE-QHD model and the particle dynamics. Section - 3 is devoted to the study 
of coupled dispersion of electron, positron and ion in a rotating magnetized e – p - i quantum 
plasma using the QHD model. Section - 4, is devoted to the investigation of solitary waves by 
applying the KdV method and it’s soliton solutions. Finally, section - 5 presents summary and 
discussion.
