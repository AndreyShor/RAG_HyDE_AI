COMPARISON OF FROBENIUS ALGEBRA STRUCTURES ON CALABI–YAU TORIC HYPERSURFACES
14
The CY Frobenius manifold structure depends on a Maurer–Cartan solution of the relevant dGBV
algebra and a good opposite ﬁltration to the Hodge ﬁltration on H•(X) and the LG Frobenius manifold
structure depends on a universal unfolding of f and a good opposite ﬁltration to the “Hodge ﬁltration”
on R(f). It seems to be a subtle question to compare these two constructions on Hr−2
pr (X) ∼= A(f)
explicitly. The LG construction is more explicit in that it deals directly with a polynomial f (while
the CY construction deals with holomorphic polyvector ﬁelds on a manifold X), and can be made into
a concrete algorithm (see [10]) based on the Gr¨obner basis by using the Jacobian ideal membership
problem for f.
Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.2 provide a non-trivial Frobenius manifold structure on the LG Frobenius
algebra simply by transporting the CY Frobenius manifold structure. Hence a natural open question
would be whether there exists an LG type construction meaning “the theory of primitive forms and
higher residue pairing” (in the sense of [10]) or the L2-Hodge theoretic construction (in the sense of [11])
on (A(f), •LG, ⟨−, −⟩LG).
Finally, we conclude with a concrete example of a function f with a critical locus that is non-isolated
and non-compact, yet to which our main theorem applies.
Example 3.12. We consider the projective P1-bundle over P6 associated to the vector bundle OP6(2)⊕
OP6(3):
P = P(OP6(2) ⊕OP6(3)),
which is a smooth projective Fano toric variety of dimension 7 over C. In general, it is known that if X is
a smooth projective Fano variety and D1, · · · , Dk are nef divisors on X such that −KX −D1 −· · · −Dk
is ample, then the projective bundle P(⊕k
i=1OX(Di)) is a Fano variety. The homogeneous coordinate
ring of P is C[x0, · · · , x6, y1, y2] = C[z1, · · · , z9], which is graded by the class group Cl(P) of P. In this
case, Cl(P) is isomorphic to Z2. In fact, we have
deg(xi) = (1, 0)
for
i = 0, · · · , 6,
deg(y1) = (−2, 1),
deg(y2) = (−3, 1).
Also note that P can be written as a GIT quotient:
P ∼= (C7 \ {0} × C2 \ {0})/(C×)2,
where (C×)2 ∼= D = Spec(C[Cl(P)]):
(ζ1, ζ2) · (x0, · · · , x6, y1, y2) = (ζ1x0, · · · , ζ1x6, ζ−2
1 ζ2y1, ζ−3
1 ζ2y2),
(ζ1, ζ2) ∈(C×)2.
Then the anti-canonical divisor class β = −KP of P is given by P9
i=1 deg zi = (2, 2) ∈Z2 ∼= Cl(P).
Since P is Fano, β is ample. Let
f(z) = f(x, y) = y2
1 · u(x) + y2
2 · v(x) ∈C[z1, · · · , z9],
where u(x) (respectively, v(x)) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 6 (respectively, 8) in C[x0, · · · , x6] =
C[z1, · · · , z7]. Then deg f = (2, 2) = β under the identiﬁcation Z2 ∼= Cl(P).
Moreover, we assume that Xu,v := {x ∈P6 : u(x) = v(x) = 0} deﬁnes a smooth projective complete
intersection variety of ample hypersurfaces in P6. Then Xf ⊂P deﬁnes a Calabi–Yau (i.e. deg f = β)
smooth ample hypersurface in P. Note that the critical locus
Crit(f) =

∂f(a)

is given by
Crit(f) = (C7 × {0}) ⊔({0} × (C2 \ {0}),
which is non-isolated and non-compact in C9. On the other hand, (1.2) holds, since X is even-dimensional.
Hence our main theorem applies.
