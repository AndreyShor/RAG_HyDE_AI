All the above equations may be used to determine the generalized moments ϕα;ℓ(up to some
integration constants) by taking the number density ρ = ϕ0 as a starting point. Schematically,
the following steps must be taken to compute ϕα;ℓ:
ϕ0
χ0
χα
ϕℓ
ϕα;ℓ
(35)
(36)
(31)
(34)
We will use the above procedure to determine only the perturbative parts of these objects,
rather than their full trans-series. To obtain the full trans-series of the ϕℓmoments, for the
non-perturbative corrections we will also need the perturbative parts of the Oα,β-s as well (these
can be calculated for example via (31) from χα). Clearly, the perturbative parts of the quantities
Oα,β, χα, ϕℓsatisfy the same differential equations as their full expressions.
All of the differential relations are simpler to solve (although longer to express) in terms
of the running coupling v, where after proper normalization (see Section 4) each of the above
objects’ perturbative parts are simply (asymptotic) power serieses of v.
Rewriting (35) in terms of ρ-derivatives, it simplifies as
d2ϕℓ
dρ2 = 2ℓ(2ℓ−1) ϕℓ−1
(2χ0)4 .
(37)
Thus the structure of the solution must be the following:
ϕℓ= ˆϕℓ+ pℓρ + qℓ,
(38)
where ˆϕℓis a particular solution to (37), and we need to fix the constants of the homogeneous
solution pℓ, qℓfrom elsewhere. We will turn to this problem in Subsection 3.2, however, there
we will use the variable v instead of ρ.
The works [7, 23] rewrite (35) in terms of the dimensionless parameter γ = c/n = (2πg)2 =
4π/ρ to generate the higher moments
e2ℓ≡γ2ℓ+1 ϕℓ
4π,
ℓ> 1
(39)
from existing data for the energy density e = e2 in the following way:
d2
dγ2
 e2ℓ

= ℓ(2ℓ−1)
 d2
dγ2
 e2
γ2
 e2(ℓ−1)
γ2(ℓ−1)

for
ℓ> 1.
(40)
These relations should provide us a way to study the resurgence relations of the higher moments
directly in the physical coupling based on the trans-series of e. However, the latter itself has to
be calculated from
d2
dγ2
 e2

(γχ0)4 ,
(41)
i.e. (37) taken at ℓ= 1. As we will see, the trans-series structure of χ0 is only known in terms of
the running coupling v, and we did not find a way to express it in terms of γ or g explicitly. Thus,
in the next sections we will determine the resurgent properties of ϕℓin terms of v instead, using
the ϕα;ℓand Oα,β generalized moments. Then we rewrite it in terms of the physical coupling g
in a direct way (while truncating the trans-series at finite orders).
