(S.17)
meaning that for a small mechanical damping rate γ ≪λ, a near-perfect gravitationally-induced transparency is achievable
at ω = 0. In the opposite regime of a large mechanical damping rate γ ≫λ, the maximum transmissivity is of the order of
λ2/γ2 ≪1, making the experimental detection of non-classicality very difficult due to the strong signal attenuation. We can also
explicitly evaluate the optimal effective thermal occupation number N(ω) defined in Eq. (S.14), obtaining the simple identity:
Nopt = N(ω)|ω=0, g=gopt = NT,
(S.18)
meaning that the effective temperature of the optimal gravity-induced attenuator corresponds to the real temperature of the
mechanical resonators. A further interesting observation is the following:
α2|ω=0, g=gopt = 0,
(S.19)
where α2 is the coefficient appearing in Eq. (S.8) The above equation has a quite intuitive physical interpretation: the optimal
gravity-induced transparency is obtained at zero optical reflection. Indeed, taking into account the symmetry between the
exchange of S 1 and S 2, Eq. (S.19) implies that any signal encoded in ainj does not leak from the corresponding cavity output
aoutj such that the transmission to the opposite cavity output aout3−j is maximized.
B.
Suboptimality of the ω , 0 case
Maximizing the ratio in Eq. (S.15) with respect to ω we get three critical points: ω = 0 and ω = ±ω′, where ω′ =

g2 −κ2/8 −γ2/8 −λ2/2. We already considered the special case ω = 0. Moreover, since the quantity we are optimiz-
ing is even with respect to ω, we can focus on just ω = ω′. In this case, the ratio is a monotonically increasing function of g and
we have

The above expression shows that the non-resonant case ω , 0 is always suboptimal with respect to the resonant case ω = 0
considered in Eq. (S.16).
C.
Transparency linewidth of the gravity-induced channel
We have just shown that the optimal gravity-induced transmission is achieved at ω = 0 (relative to the cavity frequency
ωA), but how large is the frequency band around ω = 0 in which we have a significant transparency? Since the GIT channel
is mediated by the mechanical resonators and since the mechanical resonators have a narrow frequency response, we expect a
narrow transparency window of the order of the effective linewidth of the mechanical resonators.
Therefore, to estimate the transparency frequency window, we need to estimate the effective damping rate of the mechanical
resonators. The laser detuning considered in this work is ∆= ωB, corresponding to the so-called laser-cooling regime that has
been extensively studied in the field of quantum optomechanics [14, 15]. In this laser-cooling regime, and within the RWA, the
mechanical damping rate γ is increased by the optical cavity mode such that the effective damping rate is γ(eff) ≃γ + 4g2/κ
[15]. We have already shown that the gravitationally induced transmission is optimized for gopt = ( √κ/2)(γ2 + 4λ2)1/4 (see Eq.
(S.16)), yielding the following estimate of the transparency linewidth:
