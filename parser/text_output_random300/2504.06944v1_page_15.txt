depth is required. As noted in Section 4.3 above, measurements are already underway to help 
characterize the change in geotechnical properties as a function of depth within a granular 
sample. Since density is expected to increase with sample depth, it is unlikely that the cohesive 
energy density profile is homogenous throughout the sample as well. Nevertheless, using 
density and cohesion as an initial estimate provides valuable insight into the relationship 
between viscous erosion rate and sample cohesion, as well as general weighting of terms in 
eqs. 1 and 5. 
 
4.5 Equations for Viscous Erosion 
The observed volumetric erosion rates presented in Figure 8 match the theoretical 
predictions from Metzger (2024a) when adjusted slightly as shown in eq. 6, where f(C) is an 
unknown non-linear function of surface material cohesion. By setting =0.5, a reasonable first-
order approximation of the erosion rate can be achieved for examined materials with cohesion 
values below 1,000 Pa, as shown in eq. 7 and Figure 8. Scatter in the observed data is noted in 
Figure 8, as observed data points don’t fall exactly on the predicted line, likely due to the 
inherent variability of granular materials, the complexity of erosion processes, or the presence 
of other potential PSI mechanisms. However, the largest deviations from the model in Figure 8 
are evident for cohesion values greater than 1,000 Pa, corresponding to the nonlinear influence 
of cohesion discussed in the previous section. While the ambient conditions during these tests 
differ greatly from those on the Moon, the relationship in eq. 7 is expected to still provide a 
basis for initial prediction of erosion rates, especially given the fact that only viscous erosion 
processes were observed during these trials (Section 3.2). However, additional experiments are 
already underway to examine the impact of ambient pressure on eq. 7 below.  Since these 
governing equations for viscous erosion are being used in computer simulations for future 
Moon landings and launches, special care therefore should be given to consider these potential 
limitations of eq. 1 (Rahimi et al., 2020). Future research is necessary to develop a more 
accurate relationship between α and material properties like cohesion and density, especially as 
a function of depth.

The fact that observed data seems to match theorized results best when K is equal to 2π 
may be related to the circular geometry of either the nozzle or crater shape. However, if the 
value 2π is purely related to geometries, then an additional variable is likely missing from eqs.

is expected to have units of velocity. Metzger (2024a) theorized that the thermal velocity of gas 
in the boundary layer, as opposed to gas jet velocity (𝑣), may be a better variable for predicting 
erosion rate, which may also yield a different value for constant K. Nevertheless, the influence 
of temperature variations on K remains uncertain, as all experiments were conducted at room 
temperature. Since exhaust velocities and temperatures for rockets landing or launching on the
