The λ-expansion vs. numerics, for N = 3, r = 2, k = 1
Here, we study the SU(3), r = 2, k = 1 leading-order solution, eqn. (4.1), of the λ-expansion
around the constant-F solution. This is the case we studied numerically in section 4.2 above.
We shall select a few configurations obtained on the lattice that have field strengths that are
almost constant (as seen in Figure 6) and compare their gauge invariant densities with the
analytic expressions obtained in the leading-order λ-expansion. As we already discussed, the
best we can do in the framework of the λ expansion is to stop at this order. Higher orders
are increasingly complicated due to the fact that (as opposed to the gcd(k, r) = r case), W(0)
µ
is not set to zero and a nonvanishing r.h.s. of all equations appear at higher orders.
Here, since p = 0, 1 and C′ = 1, C = 1, 2, the solution (4.1) takes the form, remembering
that W1,3 are determined from the W2,4 components given below:

while there is only a single set S0 = {0, 1}, see (4.4), in this simple example. Thus, from
