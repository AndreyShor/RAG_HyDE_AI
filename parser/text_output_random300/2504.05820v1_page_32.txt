being P the path-ordering operator. For the non-singlet sector it is possible to find an analytic
solution, while in the singlet case different type of approximations are possible. We refer to
Section 2.1.1 for a more detailed discussion of how these methods are implemented at different
perturbative orders and how the final result is then converted back into x-space. The LO the

Phenomenologically, at higher scales the DGLAP splitting induces a raise in the small-x tails
of the singlet and gluon PDFs, while it decrease the large-x PDF. At low energy the proton is
dominated by the valence PDFs, and the higher we go in energy the more the quark and gluon
sea becomes relevant (see also Fig. 2.12).
1.3.3. PDF and DIS coefficients
We are now equipped with all the necessary ingredients to analyze how higher order QCD
correction are included into DIS structure functions. By using the factorization theorem of
Eq. (1.54) we can write

where the index j distinguish the type of electroweak interaction j ∈{γγ, γZ, Zγ, ZZ, WW},
and i ∈{2, L, 3}. The objects Cj
i,k are called DIS coefficient functions, which can be expanded
