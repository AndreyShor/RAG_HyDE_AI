As for the total decay rate in Eq. (7), we have solved
Eq. (7) by setting its left-hand side to Γaverage while fixing
|Vcd| to |Vcd|PDG.
This allows us to extract |Vcs|, for
which we obtain
|Vcs| = 0.951 (35) ,
(17)
in very good agreement with |Vcs|PDG = 0.975(6). The
determination of |Vcs| obtained this way is largely in-
dependent on the specific value of |Vcd| used. Varying
|Vcd|2 even by 50% relative to its PDG value changes
|Vcs| by less than 0.5 σ. The current accuracy of our |Vcs|
determination is at the level of ≃3.5%, which has not
yet reached the precision found in exclusive semileptonic
decays. The larger uncertainties stem from both the lat-
tice computation (mainly statistical errors, see Figure 3)
and, to a slightly smaller extent, experimental measure-
ments. Both of them can [45] (and will) be significantly
improved in the coming years: the 1% precision goal in
isospin symmetric QCD is well within reach.
We conclude this section with another interesting obser-
vation. In the ¯cd channel, we can compare our (fully in-
clusive) result Γ¯cd = 0.62(5)×10−14 GeV with the sum of
the available exclusive-channel measurements, to check
for potentially missing contributions. Measurements of
the branching fractions exist for D+
s
7→K0e+νe and
D+
s 7→K∗0e+νe [46, 47], yielding ΓK0+K∗0
¯cd
= 0.722(66)×
10−14 GeV. This result is compatible, at the 1.2 σ level,
with our inclusive result, indicating that at the current
level of accuracy, the K0 and K∗0 contributions saturate
the inclusive rate Γ¯cd.
CONCLUSIONS
In this letter, and the companion paper [1], we presented
Standard Model predictions for the inclusive semileptonic
decay rate of the Ds meson and its first two lepton-energy
moments. Our ab-initio approach starts from the SM La-
grangian, includes the dominant higher-order electroweak
corrections, and treats QCD non-perturbatively on the
lattice, without any uncontrolled approximation.
By
combining recent formal advances to deal with the large
number of hadronic final states involved [21] and state-
of-the-art spectral-reconstruction techniques [18], we suc-
cessfully computed these observables by taking into ac-
cout all sources of systematic errors2. Furthermore, for

a study at fixed lattice spacing and unphysical pion mass of the
same process.
the first time in the case of inclusive semileptonic decays,
we performed a comparison between first-principles lat-
tice QCD predictions and experimental results.
By using the PDG [34] values of the CKM matrix ele-
ments, our final results for Γ, M1, and M2 in Eq. (7)
are in very good agreement with experiments.
At the
same time, we observe that at the current level of the-
oretical and experimental accuracy, this channel is not
sensitive to moderate variations of |Vcd|. Therefore, we
used our theoretical predictions and |Vcd|PDG to obtain a
determination of |Vcs| with O(3%) total accuracy, in per-
fect agreement with the current PDG determination. In
fact, at present, the inclusive Ds 7→Xℓ¯νℓchannel is not
competitive with more precise exclusive determinations
of |Vcs|. On the other hand, since our theoretical error is
dominated by the statistical uncertainty and the exper-
imental errors can likely be reduced [45], the situation
will certainly improve in the future.
As an extension of the present study, one obvious choice
would be to carry out a similar analysis for B mesons.
Indeed, the results presented in this letter and in the com-
panion paper [1] demonstrate that inclusive semileptonic
decays of heavy mesons can now be studied on the lat-
tice from first-principles at a phenomenologically relevant
level of accuracy. We are going to exploit the implications
of this exciting new perspective in a future work [49].
