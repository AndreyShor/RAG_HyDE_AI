that, for the special case of a cubic lattice, bα =

Valence electrons and pseudoions
In Sec. 2.1 we described how the quantum simulation of dynamics with pseudoions is governed by the modified
Hamiltonian in Eq. (3). Here we describe that modified Hamiltonian in the plane-wave basis. Moving to the
pseudoion description:
• The electronic kinetic energy and electron-electron interaction (Eq. (27) and Eq. (29)) are simply
modified by replacing the number of electrons ηel with the chosen number of valence electrons ηval.
• The nuclear kinetic energy (Eq. (28)) is left unchanged.
• The ion-ion interaction in Eq. (30) is modified in two ways. First, for each ion I we replace the atomic
numbers ZI with ZPI
I
= ZI −ηcore,I, as described in Eq. (2), where ηcore,I = ηel,I −ηval,I. Second,
we introduce a cutoff Λtrunc and the associated basis set Gtrunc (and momentum exchange set G
0
trunc)
which is constructed identically to G (and ¯G0) around Eq. (18) with P max
α
replaced by P trunc
α
< P max
α
.
This is consistent with the assumption that pseudoions interact among themselves as point-charges
of atomic number ZPI
I , which is only valid as a far-field approximation. It would be inconsistent to
consider pseudoion-pseudoion interactions in the near-field (i.e. resolved by high momenta), as then
the notion of pseudoions itself breaks down.
• Finally, the electron-ion interaction in Eq. (31) has a highly nontrivial modification. As we have seen in
Eq. (9), Vel−ion is replaced by V PI
el−ion = Pηion
I=1
Pηval
i=1(V i,I
loc + V i,I
NL), with the definitions in Eq. (10)-(11).
