Lee-Yang zeros and quantum transitions
To better understand the physical properties of the gapped phases and the gapless states
on both sides from the Lifshitz points, we analyse zeros of the partition function of the model
(2) in the ground state. We follow the lines of the earlier work [28, 29]. A complete analysis

of zeros of the partition function of the model (2) at T = 0 and the physical implications of
those results are presented in Sec. A 2 of Appendix A. The key points are the following:
We parameterize the roots of the equation for zeros of the partition function by mapping
the reduced BZ onto a unit circle on the complex plane as z ≡e2ik.
It has four roots
(z±, 1/z±), two of them are mutually reciprocal (cf.
(A21) and (A22)).
The quantum
critical points correspond to the physical roots when k ∈R, i.e., those which lie on a unit
circle |z±| = 1.
Evolution of the positions of the roots on the complex plane with respect to the unit
circle in four different phases is shown in Fig. 4.
(1). In the first gapped phase (plateau ¯n = 1
2) four roots (A22) are real and negative; the
couple z−and 1/z−approaches the unit circle, merging on it at the quantum critical point
µ = µc,1, where z−= −1.
(2). The gap closes and the systems stays gapless in the IC phase, two roots are complex
conjugate and move over the unit circle:
µc,1 < µ < µL : z−= e2ikF,1,
1/z−= z∗

They determine the Fermi wave number kF,1 of the IC oscillations. Deeper in the gapless
phase the other couple approaches the unit circle, merging on it at the Lifshitz critical point
µ = µL where z+ = −1.
(3). In the gapless phase after the Lifshitz transition all four roots evolve smoothly, staying
on the unit circle
µL < µ < µc,2 : z∓= e2ikF,1/2 .

The IC oscillations of correlation functions change their nature: now they are superposition
of oscillations with two Fermi wave numbers kF,1/2. This is an observable consequence of the
