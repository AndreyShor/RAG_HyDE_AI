Figure S9. ∆𝑇𝑇∗ dynamics with varying doping in MoSe2. (a) The doping dependence 
of ∆𝑇𝑇∗ dynamics, which are extracted from the TR data in Figure 3. 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷 varies from 
0 V to 6.45 V. 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸 is fixed at 0 V. The dashed line is a two-exponential fitting. (b) The 
maximum of ∆𝑇𝑇∗ dynamics, labelled as ∆𝑇𝑇𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
∗
, as a function of 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷. (c) The rise time 
constant of ∆𝑇𝑇∗ dynamics as a function of 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷.
