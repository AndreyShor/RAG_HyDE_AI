Fig. 5. Evolutionary trajectory of the distribution of investments over time for PGG with linear benefit function B(τi) = bτi/n. The left panel
reveals that the population evolves to full defection when b/c > r∗and the right one shows that the population evolves to full defection when
b/c < r∗. Parameter values: b = 2, c = 1, x0 = 0.9, and ω = 1 in panel (a); b = 5, c = 1, x0 = 0.1, and ω = 1 in panel (b).
Fig. 6. Evolutionary trajectory of the distribution of investments over time for PGG with saturating benefits B(τi) = b(1 −exp(−βsigτi)).
The gray dashed line represents the theoretically calculated value of the ESS. Parameter values: b = 10, c = 1, βsig = 1, ω = 1, and x0 = 0.1.
