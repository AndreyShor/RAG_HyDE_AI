• Measure the extra register, obtaining outcome 0 with probability sx.
• Repeat.
Note that we can see s as the average of a Bernoulli variable that takes two values, 1 when the target
chemical species is identified at the final time (which has probability s = P
x pxsx) and 0 when it is not
(which has probability P
x px(1 −sx)). When averaged over Nsample trials, we obtain a random variable
with average s and variance s(1 −s)/Nsample ≤s/Nsample. By Chebyshev’s inequality, the empirical mean ˜s
satisfies Eq. (134) up to a constant failure probability (say, 0.1%) as long as
Nsamples = O(s−1ϵ−2).
(136)
The overall cost of this procedure then scales as
O
Cinit + Calgo
sϵ2

,
(137)
where Cinit is the average cost of initializing the initial state and Calgo is the cost of running the rest of the
algorithm. Note that the scaling with s−1 is expected to be a limiting factor, since s will be small in many
instances despite our attempts to favorably bias the reaction as discussed in Sec. 2.2. This can be partially
mitigated (at the cost of longer depth) by the following procedure.
Solution 2: coherent averaging by amplitude amplification
The coherent averaging procedure is as follows:
• Apply a unitary on O(log2 |S|) qubit registers, preparing them in the state
|S|−1
X
x=0
√px|x⟩,
(138)
where x is just an integer label of the configurations in S.
• Apply the controlled unitary P
x Ux ⊗|x⟩⟨x| that prepares the initial state
|S|−1
X
x=0
√px|ψx(0)⟩|x⟩,
(139)
from the all zero state.
• Run the time-evolution and chemical species identification components of the algorithm, to obtain the
state

x (t)⟩|x⟩, where the extra
register flags as |0⟩the identification of a target species and by ‘not zero’ as everything else.
• Perform amplitude estimation to estimate the amplitude of the zero component.
Note that in the first step we need to be able to prepare a quantum state that coherently encodes the
distribution px. In the worst case this has a cost O(|S|), but if px has special properties (e.g., if it can be
well-approximated by a much simpler reference distribution [75]), then the cost will have better scaling, up
to O(log2 |S|). In the second step the initialization unitary has in the worst case a cost O(|S|Cinit), while
in many cases we can expect further savings exploiting the structure of the configuration space. The third
step has a cost Calgo, as before.
