Figure 9. Radial metallicity profiles in the fiducial
simulation at different epochs from ùë°

1000 Myr, with color gradient indicating simulation
time.
The metallicity profiles at ùë°= 1000 Myr from
noSNfb (dashed) and noAGNfb (dotted) simulations are
overlaid for comparison. In the fiducial model, metal-
licity profiles evolve temporally and approach saturation
near ùë°‚àº500 Myr, with regions beyond 1 kpc exhibiting
substantially greater enhancement compared to single-
feedback models.
the noSNfb (dashed) and noAGNfb (dotted) sim-
ulations. In the fiducial model, metallicity in-
creases progressively with time until reaching ap-
proximate saturation around ùë°‚àº500 Myr. While
central regions (ùëü‚â≤1 kpc) demonstrate modest
metallicity enhancement, outer regions (ùëü‚â≥1 kpc)
exhibit substantially greater enrichment, achieving
slightly super-solar metallicity at CGM scales by
the simulation‚Äôs conclusion ‚Äì an enhancement of
approximately one order of magnitude relative to
initial conditions.
The noSNfb and noAGNfb simulations yield simi-
lar metallicity profiles that are systematically lower
by factors of several compared to the fiducial
model beyond 1 kpc. While observed CGM metal-
licities span a broad range up to ‚àº10 [O/H] (Za-
hedy et al. 2019), accommodating predictions from
all three models, our results suggest that the com-
bined action of SN and AGN feedback substantially
enhances CGM metal enrichment relative to either
mechanism in isolation. This enhanced enrichment
likely results from more efficient metal ejection
from central regions followed by improved mix-
ing and turbulent diffusion throughout the CGM
when both feedback channels operate simultane-
ously. Future implementation will enable the evo-
lution and tracking of individual metal species, pro-
viding a more detailed understanding of metal en-
richment processes in galaxy evolution.
3.9. X-ray properties of the gas
We analyze the soft X-ray emission from the
fiducial simulations by computing the radiation
from collisional ionization equilibrium under the
optically thin approximation, using the Astrophys-
ical Plasma Emission Code (APEC) model (Smith
et al. 2001; Foster et al. 2012). Our calculations
consider only gas emission, excluding contribu-
tions from the AGN or other point sources. The
X-ray luminosity exhibits temporal variations span-
ning approximately two orders of magnitude, with
peaks coinciding with AGN outbursts and a time-
averaged value of ‚àº2.6 √ó 1041 erg s‚àí1. While this
luminosity falls within observational constraints,
it is several factors below the best-fit values from
ROSAT and recent eROSITA observations (Ander-
son et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2024). We hypothesize
that incorporating cosmological inflows, currently
absent in our isolated galaxy simulations, might
help increase the X-ray luminosity.
Fig. 10 shows the projection plots of the soft X-
ray luminosity viewed from the polar (top) and
azimuthal (bottom) angles, zoomed in to a ra-
dius of 100 kpc, at different stages of the evolu-
tion as shown in Fig. 3 etc.
The X-ray proper-
ties viewed from the polar angle are approximately
spherical, while large-scale asphericity arises when
viewed from the azimuthal angle at certain times,
e.g., ùë°= 57 Myr, 67 Myr, and 166 Myr. For in-
stance, at ùë°= 67 Myr, a ‚àº20 kpc X-ray cavity
surrounded by a bi-polar bubble structure is vis-
ible, when the instantaneous AGN luminosity is
low (ùêøBH ‚àº1.7√ó10‚àí4ùêøEdd). The cavity is not pro-
duced by AGN jets in the hot mode (AGN jets are
not implemented yet in the simulation), but rather
