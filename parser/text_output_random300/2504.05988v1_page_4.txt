Figure 2: (Left) Sketch of our target beta function. (Right) 3D plot of ∆. The
pink lines follow the 3D surface of ∆for a fixed α. The surface intersects the
horizontal plane ∆= 0 along the green curve. For a fixed deformation ϵ there
are two possible FPs; the red star corresponds to the Wilson-Fisher one while a
second FP (orange star) is connected to the interacting FP in the ϵ →0 limit.
One can draw the corresponding surface ∆(α, ϵ), plotted in Fig.2b, which for fixed α
gives the corresponding line in the ϵ direction.
The intersection curve between the obtained surface and the ∆= 0 plane (plotted
in green in Fig.2b) corresponds to all the possible FPs of the deformed theory in d −ϵ
dimensions. This curve is defined via, the equation ϵ = β(α)
α
= Y (α).
We observe that for a given ϵ there are two possible FPs (highlighted by the red and
orange stars in Fig.2b). The one close to the origin corresponds to the Wilson-Fisher FP
(red star in Fig.2b), which is smoothly connected to the Gaussian FP in the ϵ →0 limit.
Moreover, as depicted in figure 3a the two FPs must have their corresponding tangents
with opposite signs leading to multi-valued ω. Consequently at the merger (αl, ϵl) the
tangent must be zero i.e. ω (ϵl) = 0 (see Fig.3b). This merger point (αl, ϵl) corresponds
1From here on we drop the superscript ∗on α as we always work at criticality.
