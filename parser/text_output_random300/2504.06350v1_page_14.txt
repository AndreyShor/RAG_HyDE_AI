(b) correlations with inefficient detectors
Figure 7: CHSH with inefficient detectors – Fig. 7a encapsulates the optimal value of βQ at given value of αA + αB ≤2.
The 7b illustrates the impact of detector inefficiencies on nonlocal quantum correlations within the simplest Bell scenario.
The blue region represents the set of quantum correlations p ∈Q in ideal conditions.
With the detection efficiencies
ηA = ηB = 0.85, and the local assignement strategy qA(a|x) = δa,0, qB(b|y) = δb,0, the effective quantum correlations
˜p = ΩηAηB (p) are constrained to the smaller orange subset (see Fig. 2d). The blue dot on the blue curve corresponds
to the isotropic behavior piso that maximally violates the CHSH inequality, β(piso) = 2
√
2, in ideal conditions, while
the corresponding effective behavior (blue dot on the orange curve) ˜piso = ΩηAηB (piso) no longer attains the maximum
violation of the CHSH inequality, β( ˜piso) ≈2.08854. Instead, the red dot on the blue curve corresponds to the quantum
behavior ptilted which maximally violates the doubly-tilted CHSH inequality (dashed black line)[139, 18].
Considering also the “no click” events, the inequality (11) turns out to be β(ˆp) < 2. It is well known
that optimal local assignment gives β(pA(a|x)qB(b|y)) = 2⟨MA|0⟩, β(qA(a|x)pB(b|y)) = 2⟨NB|0⟩, and
β(qA(a|x)qB(b|y)) = 2. This yields
β(ˆp) = ηAηBβ(p) + 2ηA(1 −ηB)⟨MA|0⟩+ 2(1 −ηA)ηB⟨NB|0⟩+ 2(1 −ηA)(1 −ηB) ≤2.
(26)
This can be rewritten as (αA = 2(1 −ηB)/ηB and αB = 2(1 −ηA)/ηA)
βQ ≡β(p) + αA⟨A0⟩+ αB⟨B0⟩≤2 + αA + αB ≡βL ≤4.
(27)
The last inequality comes from L ⊂NS (β(pNL) = 4).
Therefore αA + αB ≤2 (or equivalently,

> 3) =⇒Q \ L = ∅. There is no room for quantum violation as shown in Fig. 2d as the
local vertex is moving up towards what is known as the critical detection efficiency (CDE) (observe in
Fig.7b that βQ approaches the local bound). Graphically, one can imagine that the plane of Fig. 2c
and 2d with the local vertices approaches the no-signalling vertex pNL (more geometrical details are in
Refs. [147–150]).
Definition 3. The open detection loophole refers to the implication β(p) > 2 =⇒p ∈Q \ L mistakenly
(assuming p = ˆp) ignoring the “no click” events.
In many cases, local models can be constructed that are compatible with the experimental data [151]. It
has been shown that manipulation of measurement devices can not only lead to fake violations of BI [142]
but also to violations of Tsirelson’s bound 2
√
2 [152]. In DI-QKD, low values of ηA and ηB allow Eve to
intercept and hide herself more effectively because many “no-click” events would already occur naturally
due to losses from attenuation and imperfect detectors. On the contrary, high detection efficiency η ≲1
helps to distinguish Eve’s attacks from natural losses by maintaining a high value of βQ −βL, which
translates to a reliable measure of nonlocality.
Definition 4. The detection loophole is closed on the test βQ = β(ˆp) > βL as genuinely implies (if all
other loopholes are closed) ˆp ∈Q \ L.
Proposition 1. A necessary condition to close the detection loophole in Bell experiments implies η > η∗,
where η∗is the CDE. (see a representation in Fig. 2d).
Indeed, η∗is a characteristic of an ideal nonlocal correlation, below which Q \ L = ∅, and limits the
distance across which nonlocality can be operationally (quantum) certified. In the simplest Bell scenario
