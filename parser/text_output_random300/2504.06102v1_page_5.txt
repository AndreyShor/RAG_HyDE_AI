Evaluation Results
In total, we trained five IIDSs for the relatively small 01-Basic
scenario, which features few stations and data points compared to
more realistic networks such as the 02-Semiurban and 03-Rural
scenarios. Table 3 presents our evaluation results. Of these IIDSs,
PASAD and Invariant did not produce useful results. Instead, they
generated one continuous alert for most of the test data.
The other three IIDSs also only achieve mediocre attack detection
performance. A key challenge lies in the dynamic nature of power
grids, which exhibit constantly shifting stable configurations driven
by factors such as maintenance activities, energy generation and
consumption patterns, and the state of connected superordinate
grids. Figure 1 clearly illustrates this phenomenon. Two attacks
lead to clear outliers in the measured power. However, the two
highlighted switching events drastically change the power lines’
characteristics, such that trivial intrusion detection mechanisms
have a hard time identifying attacks.
To still investigate the potential of process-aware intrusion de-
tection in power grids, we filtered data points that substantially
changed between the test and training phases. While this filter-
ing approach facilitates assessing process-aware IDS performance
under idealized conditions, it is not feasible in real-world deploy-
ments where all measurements may eventually be affected by such
changes in the power grid. Nevertheless, this approach provides
insight into how process-aware IDS could perform if supplemented
with contextual information, such as schedules for planned mainte-
nance activities.
After filtering, Seq2SeqNN, SIMPLE, and GeCo show strong
detection performance. An effective IIDS should produce near-zero
false alarms, detect most attacks, and do so with minimal delay.
While process-aware intrusion detection shows promising potential,
the power grid domain still faces several unresolved challenges.

Challenges in Power Grids
Our evaluation shows the potential of process-aware intrusion
detection for power grids. The achieved detection performance will
likely improve with further research into detection methodologies
facilitated by Sherlock. However, these results were achieved only
after filtering sensor values impacted by maintenance activities
or switching operations. Our initial benchmarking highlights six
challenges in implementing process-aware intrusion detection in
power grids, which also exist in other domains to varying degrees.
Some IIDSs faced difficulties during training even on the small-
scale 01-Basic reference grid, despite its relatively limited number

of substations. Furthermore, each substation in Sherlock transmits
a minimal amount of data as we employ a single-phase power grid
model and, due to the steady-state simulation, abstract from features
such as the power grid’s utility frequency. IIDSs designed for power
grids may reach scalability limitations in practical deployments, a
shared problem with other industrial domains [11].
Challenge 1 – Scalability
Intrusion detection must be capable of handling the frequent
transmission of hundreds to thousands of data points that are
generated by power grid operations.
Beyond the sheer volume of training data, it is impossible to
observe all possible states during the training. IIDSs typically aim to
learn the cyclic and repetitive behavior of cyber-physical processes
in order to detect anomalies. Ideally, the training phase would span
multiple cycles to capture this behavior. However, in power grids,
this cyclic behavior is only partially present due to factors such as
daily weather changes, seasonal variations, maintenance operations,
multiple stable configurations, and the ongoing integration of new
components (e.g., wind turbines). As a result, some perfectly valid
grid configurations may never be observed during training.
Challenge 2 – Training Data Limitation
Even with attack-free training data collected over an extended pe-
riod, some entirely valid grid configurations would likely remain
unobserved.
The operation of a power grid introduces regular benign anom-
alies, which pose an additional challenge for intrusion detection.
Maintenance operations, for example, often require switching off
specific power lines and redirecting power flows. Additionally,
changes in power demand and generation, including those in sub-
ordinate power grids, as well as equipment failures, can necessitate
adjustments to the power grid configuration to prevent overloading
particular lines. Ideally, these benign changes should not trigger
alarms in an IIDS, or at least not result in prolonged false alarms.
Challenge 3 – Benign Anomalous Behavior
Benign anomalous behavior should be anticipated and not trigger
(prolonged) false alarms, ensuring dependable surveillance.
An additional challenge for intrusion detection in power grids
is the need to consider multiple vantage points. While the control
center acts as the primary sink for most measurements and the
origin for control commands, a network capture taken just in front
of it does not provide a complete picture. Some communications
