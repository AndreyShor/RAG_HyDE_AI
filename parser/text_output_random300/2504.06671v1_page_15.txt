to be related to the modified divacancies located at or near Frank-type stacking faults [28]. Figure 9 shows 
PL spectrum of the various divacancies in 4H-SiC with six PL lines being observed. While investigating the 
individual divacancy arrays in 4H-SiC introduced by He FIB, He et al. [28] have studied the so-called 
modified divacancies, PL5 and PL6. Their results have indicated PL6 as a defect with exceptional properties 
for quantum applications.

Significant progress in divacancy defect engineering has been achieved by Wolfowicz et al. [70]. They have 
achieved the optical charge state control of divacancy in 4H-SiC. Using the above-bandgap excitation they 
have efficiently converted divacancy toward its neutral-charge state, and more importantly drastically 
increased the PL intensity, without affecting the spin properties.  
Another well-studied defect in SiC is the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV). This defect consists 
of a nitrogen shallow donor at a carbon lattice site paired with a neighboring silicon vacancy (Figure 10).
