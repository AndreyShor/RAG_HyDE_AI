hancement of the polaron binding energy, which modifies the dispersion relation of charge
carriers in the vicinity of the zero Landau level. The effect is particularly evident in SiO2
and SiC, whose balanced η and ℏωSO values allow for stronger substrate–carrier interaction.
On the other hand, h-BN and HfO2 exhibit smaller shifts, consistent with their weaker
phonon-mediated coupling or lower phonon energies. These results reinforce the idea that
electrical control of dispersion properties in graphene–substrate systems can be achieved by
tuning both substrate choice and external field parameters.
In both panels, the curves exhibit a pronounced dispersive structure, with positive and
negative extrema centered around specific photon energy values. These extrema correspond
to resonant modifications in the optical response induced by transitions near the polaron gap.
As the magnetic field increases, the magnitude of these features becomes more prominent,
indicating that the refractive index is sensitive to magnetic confinement and the associated
enhancement of the polaronic interaction.
Interestingly, the application of the electric field [Fig. 5(b)] does not significantly alter
the amplitude of the refractive index variations. This trend suggests that the real part of
the susceptibility, which governs refraction, is less sensitive to electric-field-induced carrier
localization than the absorption-related imaginary part. However, a clear shift in the peak
positions is observed across all substrates, especially for those with higher polarization pa-
rameters (such as SiO2 and SiC). This feature indicates that substrate phonons play a key
role in modulating the dispersion characteristics and that the field-enhanced electron-phonon
coupling modifies the resonance condition.
Among the four substrates, SiO2 exhibits the largest shift and most pronounced disper-
sive behavior, consistent with its balanced η and ℏωSO. On the other hand, HfO2, despite its
high polarization parameter, shows a relatively less dramatic shift, once again highlighting
the dampening role of low phonon energy.
Figure 6 shows the behavior of the third-order nonlinear relative refractive index as a
function of photon energy for four different polar substrates: h-BN, SiC, SiO2, and HfO2,
