One zero mode for WL = 0, WR = ±1
For sgn(ML) = 1, sgn(MR) = −1, and Re(vR) ̸= 0, the topological invariants are WL = 0 and WR = sgn(Re(vR)) = ±1.
Moreover, in this case, one has sgn(Re(α±
R)) = s sgn(Re(vR)) and Re(α+
L) > 0 > Re(α−
L). Choosing s = −sgn(Re(vR))
gives Re(α±
R) < 0, and therefore the two linearly independent solutions φs
1,2(x) in Eq. (A11) respectively decay to zero and
diverge for x →−∞and both diverge for x →∞, and thus their linear combination cannot satisfy the boundary conditions.
Choosing instead s = sgn(Re(vR)) gives Re(α±
R) > 0, and therefore the solution φs
1(x) now decays to zero for x →±∞, while
φs
2(x) still diverges for x →−∞. Hence, the particular solution satisfying the boundary conditions is
φ(x) = φs
1(x),
(16)
up to a normalization constant, with pseudospin s = sgn(Re(vR)) in Eq. (2), φs
1(x) as in Eqs. (A11) and (B12), and αL, αR

For the limiting case sgn(ML) = 0, sgn(MR) = −1, and Re(vL)Re(vR) < 0, the solution in Eq. (16) still satisfy the boundary
conditions. Indeed, by taking mL = 0 into the solution, one has that α+
L > 0 if s = −sgn(Re(vL)), which is indeed the case
since we choose s = sgn(Re(vR)) and Re(vL)Re(vR) < 0.
The asymptotic behavior is determined on the left by the exponents α+
L = −svL + qL (characteristic lengths ξ+
L , λ+
L) and on
the right by α−
R = svR −qR (characteristic lengths ξ−

One zero mode for WL = ±1, WR = 0
Analogous arguments hold in the case sgn(ML) = −1, sgn(MR) = 1, and Re(vL) ̸= 0, where the topological invariants
are WL = sgn(Re(vL)) = ±1 and WR = 0. Moreover, in this case, one has sgn(Re(α±
L)) = −s sgn(Re(vL)) and Re(α+
R) >
0 > Re(α−
R). Choosing s = sgn(Re(vL)) gives Re(α±
L) < 0, and therefore the two linearly independent solutions φs
1,2(x) in
Eq. (A11) respectively diverge and decays to zero for x →∞and both diverge for x →−∞, and thus their linear combination
cannot satisfy the boundary conditions. Choosing instead s = −sgn(Re(vL)) gives Re(α±
L) > 0, and therefore the solution
φs
2(x) now decays to zero for x →±∞while φs
1(x) diverges for x →∞. Hence, the particular solution satisfying the boundary
conditions is
φ(x) = φs

up to a normalization constant, with corresponding pseudospin s = −sgn(Re(vL)) in Eq. (2), φs
