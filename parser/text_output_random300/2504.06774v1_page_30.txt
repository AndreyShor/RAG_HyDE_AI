to compensate for some of the limitations of SVD.

Case: Laminar Flow Past a Circular Cylinder (3D)
The flow past a three-dimensional cylinder extends the dynamics observed in two-dimensional
cases. This data set captures the flow behavior at Re = 280, where the flow transitions
to a fully three-dimensional state, showcasing intricate patterns and interactions in the
spanwise direction.
A total of 599 snapshots were collected during the simulation, but only the last 299
snapshots, representing the saturated flow regime, were used in this study. As mentioned
before, the flow in the spanwise direction only begins to form between 200 to 300 snap-
