Given that the index s is only over five values, we compute this state using a routine for preparing states
with arbitrary amplitudes. For arbitrary state preparation, we use coherent alias sampling. Note, however,
that the preparation is multiplexed over the ion index I (or more specifically, the ion species index ζI). Given
that ζI = 1 . . . Z is loaded in unary using the QROM in App. E.5.1, the total cost for this subroutine is the
cost of a singly-controlled alias sampler, multiplied by the total number of nuclear species Z. The steps for
the alias sampling are as follows:
1. Controlled on the ζI bit, prepare a uniform superposition over 5 amplitudes with cost 15+2bs for some
precision bs.
2. Controlled on the ζI bit, use a QROM to load alt values and keep probabilities with a cost of 7 Toffolis.
We also use this QROM to load b-bit approximants to the precomputed coefficients θζ,l
α
as needed in
Sec. E.5.3, and the coefficients [Y α
l,ζ]a,
1
bζ,l
α , γζ,l
α
and
1
maxp |Gζ,l
α (|kp|¯rζ
l )| as needed in Sec. E.5.4.
3. For keep probabilities with bkeep bits, apply an inequality test with cost bkeep.
4. Conditioned on the flag from the inequality test, swap the alt values using 3 Toffolis.
The total cost for the alias sampler is Z(2bs + bkeep + 25). The subroutine is cheap enough that we just
assume doubling the cost to include uncomputation. As for qubits, 3 + bkeep are necessary for the QROM
and bkeep for the inequality test.

This has an identical structure to the Coulomb term in App. E.3.3, but where the momentum transfer is
between an electron-ion pair. It therefore requires a slightly larger cost of 8¯n Toffolis (because the register
encoding P is larger than that of p). The cost for checking overflow of the output momenta is free, as noted
above and in [91] Sec. II D (as the carry-out bits for the arithmetic already flag overflow).

Nuclear data loading
We use a single QROM over the pseudoion index I to (i) load the corresponding nuclear species ζI for the
interaction term; and (ii) to load a function of the pseudoion masses M

I
for state preparation in the kinetic
term. In the following section, we will often drop the subscript I in ζI for the sake of readability. The Toffoli
cost of this operation is just ηion. Given how few species we consider, we will load ζ in unary. The total
ancilla cost is then 5 + bM.
