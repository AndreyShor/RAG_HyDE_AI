General remarks
The topological operators appearing the bulk of (d+1)-dimensional SymTFT can
capture the generalized charges [28] of a d-dimensional G-Symmetric QFT. Topo-
logical operators stretching across both boundaries, after interval compactiﬁcation
produces operators charged under the symmetry. If for some reason such an oper-
ator do not ‘end’ on the physical boundary then that particular charged operator
will be absent from the absolute theory. So, we can say that the topological oper-
ators which do not end along the physical boundary describe the missing charges
of the theory [9]. In a situation like this, the symmetry does not act faithfully,
only a part of the symmetry acts faithfully, or we can say a part of the symmetry
acts trivially.

Figure 9: The p + 1-dimensional bulk operator ending on the physical boundary
along a p-dimensional operator Yp. The other end of this operator is connected
to the symmetry boundary.
After interval compactiﬁcation, we obtain the G-
symmetric QFT with an operator Op, charged under the Symmetry G.
If the
topological operator Qp+1 does not end along the physical boundary, then that
charged operator will be missing from the QFT resulting in a trivially acting
symmetry.
If we have theory with missing charges, we can construct a club sandwich [9,10],
with a topological interface IΦ from Z(G)) to Z(G′), where, G′ is the eﬀectively
acting part of G.
