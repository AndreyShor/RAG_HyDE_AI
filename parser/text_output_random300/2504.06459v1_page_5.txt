other interesting effects occur, such as ∆Qq + 1 exceed-
ing 3, whose discussion we leave for a future investigation.
We should stress that the analysis presented in this
Letter does not tell us about the color representations
that are formed to screen the color probes, so we cannot
yet test the standard expectation that these would cor-
respond to color-neutral states. This is why we have re-
ferred to meson-like or baryon-like configurations rather
than actual mesons or baryons. One way to refine the
analysis would be to evaluate the expectation value for
the Casimir operator associated with the color charge. It
would also be interesting to confront the present results
with simulations in the heavy-quark regime, which are
accessible even for finite chemical potentials [19].
Although our results were derived in the heavy-quark
regime, we believe that some of them could extend to the
physical QCD case. In particular, working in the Landau
gauge and exploiting the well-tested expansion in the
inverse number of colors and the fact that the pure glue
coupling is not that large [20, 21], the quark contribution
to the Polyakov loop potential is given by an effective
one-loop contribution involving the rainbow-resummed
quark propagator. At low temperatures, we expect this
loop to be dominated by low momenta and thus by the
constituent quark mass, as fixed by chiral symmetry
breaking.
The latter is one order of magnitude less
than the quark masses used in Fig. 1, but the shape
of the net quark number gained by the system at low
temperatures as a function of µ should be unaltered. We
have confirmed this expectation in a model calculation
coupling the glue potential obtained within the CF
model to a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for the quark
sector.
A more ambitious calculation would involve
coupling that same glue potential (or any other with
similar features, such as those in Refs. [12, 13]) to the
rainbow-resummed quark contribution to the potential.
