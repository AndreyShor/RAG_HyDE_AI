Obtaining the second Chern number
We will read off c(Xdef)

from the genus 1 topological string free energy F(1).
Recall that F(1)
solves the genus 1 holomorphic anomaly equation [38, 39, 66]. To begin with we will work in the
φ-coordinate, and then transform our expressions into the ϕ-coordinate. The genus 1 HAE reads
∂φ∂φF(1)(φ, φ) = 1

Sφφ is one of the BCOV propagators, which we review and construct in §A. Gφφ is the metric on
moduli space, which is obtained by differentiating the K¨ahler potential K as Gφφ = ∂φ∂φK.
Recall further that (3.33) is solved by integrating with respect to φ and φ, at the expense of
introducing the genus 1 holomorphic ambiguity f(1).

(3.34)
f(1) is specified, up to an additive constant by which the genus 1 free energy remains undetermined,
by the behaviour of F(1) at the boundaries of moduli space. Let us briefly review this.
At a conifold point φc, where a number |Gc| of massless hypermultiplets arise in IIB string theory,
F(1) diverges as −|Gc|
12 log(φ −φc) [67]. We have argued, both from analysing the mirror geometry
and a GLSM computation, that our conifold point 1/27 has |Gc| = 3 and the points ±i/
√
27 have
|Gc| = 1. At a MUM point φ = 0 mirror to a geometry Y , F(1) diverges as −c(Y )

24 log(φ) [38, 39].
These conditions are satisfied in our example by taking

(3.35)
The −6 is included to cancel with a divergence at φ = 0 provided by other terms in (3.34), so that
the sum of all terms has the correct behaviour. Adding any nonconstant holomorphic function of
φ will introduce a new pole somewhere, so the above f(1) is correct.
We now stress the following important point: our moduli space has two MUM points and three
conifold points. We have completely determined f(1) by using data attached to one MUM point
and three conifold points. This means that we can use the resulting F(1) to read off the boundary
behaviour at the remaining MUM point ϕ = 0, which will provide us with c(Xdef)

. To this end, it is
more convenient to consider the first derivative ∂φF(1) in the holomorphic limit, which we explain
in more detail in §A. First notice that we can recover the second Chern number of Y from
