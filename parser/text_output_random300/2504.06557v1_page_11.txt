Network features 
We focus on the cluster coefficient, graph density, reciprocity, assortativity, 
and centrality as features to measure the properties of the four economic modes. For the 
calculation methods of typical features, please refer to references [28,29]. These 
features are calculated for the graph 𝑔(𝑡) at each step. 
The cluster coefficient is a feature that indicates the degree of clustering 
between nodes and is calculated as the ratio of the actual number of links to the possible 
number of links between neighboring nodes. The local clustering coefficient 𝐶𝑖 for
