Figure 3. Snapshots of the evolution of different quantities for the case β = 1 with µ = 2.0 with
rm = 10RH(t0), corresponding to a case of PBH formation with type-II B PBH.
In Fig.3, we present a case of type-II B PBH with β = 1, µ = 2.0. The qualitative
behavior is similar to that of the previous case involving collapsing fluctuations. The most
distinctive feature is the formation of two bifurcated trapping horizons at times tbif,1 and
tbif,2. By examining the expansion of the congruences Θ±, we observe that both vanish at
the same radial coordinate, r∗, at these times. Thus, we consistently recover the result from
[41], where bifurcated trapping horizons were observed for the same profile but with a slightly
lower amplitude (µ = 1.8). The time-gap between the formation of the bifurcated horizons,
tbif,2 −tbif,1, increases as µ exceeds the threshold for the type-B PBH configuration. We also
observe that the type-II feature is much more distinguishable compared to the previous case.
For instance, at the time of the formation of the bifurcated trapping horizon, Γ exhibits a
clearly defined negative region. In contrast, in the previous example, the throat structure
in R has already disappeared. On the other hand, for type-I fluctuations, the criteria set
in [17] state that a black hole has been formed when C ≈1. We find also valid for type-II
fluctuations.
Finally, in Fig.4, we present a case with parameters β = 4 and µ = 0.45, which cor-
responds to a ”type-II no PBH” scenario. Such cases were previously identified in [48, 49]
within the context of large negative non-Gaussianity models. This result contrasts with the
expectations from the literature that type-II fluctuations collapse forming black holes. In
our simulations, the initial configuration corresponds to a type-II fluctuation. As the cos-
