 
Fig. 3. Testing dynamic in situ modulation of the mechanical properties under electric field. a, The 
illustration of the setup of electric-field-adaptive properties testing inside a rheometer using 
oscillatory deformation. b, Snapshots of testing samples on a rheometer. Images of the gelation 
sample (with ZnO) were captured before (i) and after (ii) applying a 2 Vrms voltage. Images of the 
control sample (without ZnO) were captured before (iii) and after (iv) applying a 2 Vrms voltage. 
c, The time sweeps of storage modulus (G′) at 20 °C. d, The temperature change as a function of 
time.
