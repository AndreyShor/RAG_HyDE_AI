Fig. S25. Convergence of the band structures against k-point mesh numbers. (a) 
Band structures obtained with half-grid shift. (b) Band structures obtained without shift. 
We observe that the results with 𝑁𝑁= 96  and 𝑁𝑁= 192  overlap within the line 
thickness in (a), while convergence is slow in (b).

Fig. S26. Structures on the reaction path. Here is the summary of the crystalline 
structures of intermediate states on the reaction path found in the NEB method. Purple, 
green, red, and yellow lines correspond L1, L2, L3 and L4, respectively. In order to see 
through the stacked structures, dashed lines are used for the upper two layers (L1 and 
L2). In the upper two lines, the sliding plane is in between L2 and L3, while in the lower 
two lines, the sliding plane is in between L3 and L4.
