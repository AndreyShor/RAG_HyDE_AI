Figure 4: The ten highest reconstruction error test light curves, where A is the highest, and J the tenth highest. These curves
exhibit periodic variation over time in the measured standardised magnitude (K-T). As in A-K but for the ten lowest error test
light curves, which exhibit mostly linear variation in the standardised magnitude over time. Some curves exhibit troughs in
standardised magnitude (K, P, T).
the light curve fine-tuning, the correlation between reconstruc-
tion loss and classification accuracy decreased from 0.3 to 0.05
(Figure 7). This suggests that while the model initially utilised
the reconstruction representations to assist classification, it later
learned task-specific features for classification, effectively sep-
arating out the pre-training task from that of the fine-tuning.
The variance in this correlation was notably higher during hy-
perspectra fine-tuning when compared to the light curve fine-
tuning.
Having fine-tuned our model to high classification accuracy, we
next analysed the held-out test dataset, classifying test samples
as anomalous/non-anomalous and visualising the top twelve
most confidently predicted anomalies (Figure 8). We found a
