loss in the classical, hydrogen-poor WR stage as these are un-
derrepresented in our curated sample.
At SMC metallicity, the paradigm shifts. Models using the
standard mass-loss recipes evolve into H-free WN stars and
spend most of their lives on the He-ZAMS. This contrasts with
observations, as no H-free WN stars are detected at this metal-
licity. Conversely, the models calculated with our new mass-loss
recipe lose significantly less mass, retaining surface hydrogen
abundances around XH ≈0.25, consistent with observational
data. These models also exhibit a broader temperature distribu-
tion, potentially accounting for the observed scatter in the tem-
peratures of WR stars at SMC metallicity. This difference high-
lights the importance of adopting realistic mass-loss prescrip-
tions in stellar evolution models, particularly in low-metallicity
environments where mass loss plays a critical role in shaping the
observable properties of massive stars.
We conclude that the outcomes of single and binary star evo-
lutionary models strongly depend on the assumptions on the
mass-loss rate on the OB and WR stages. The new, empiric,
mass-loss rate recipe (Eq. (5)) pinned to the Eddington param-
eter readily supplied by stellar evolution models, eliminates the
need to switch and interpolate between various free-choice the-
oretical prescriptions, as usually done in the literature.
5. Summary
In this work, we have compiled a sample of 183 massive
stars with well-constrained stellar and wind properties from
literature across the Galaxy (70 stars), LMC (61 stars), and
SMC (52 stars). To ensure a consistent dataset capable of
yielding robust conclusions, each star included in our sample
passed several quality checks. The resulting sample spans ini-
tial masses from Mini ≈15 M⊙– 150 M⊙and temperatures in the
range T ≈12 kK – 100 kK, encompassing stars at various evo-
lutionary phases. This makes our dataset well-suited for de-
riving general insights into stellar winds and mass-loss rates.
Based on this data, we established that the mass-loss rates
of hot stars can to first order be described as a function of
the Eddington Γe and metallicity, Z. Our newly derived mass-
loss relation (see Eq. 5) has a root-mean-square dispersion of
∆log( ˙M/( M⊙yr−1)) = 0.43, corresponding to a factor of 2.7 in
mass-loss rates.
We compared our mass-loss scaling relation to mass-loss
prescriptions typically used in stellar evolution calculations. As
many other works on individual targets or small samples of stars
have reported, we also find that the typically applied mass-loss
recipes overestimate the empirically derived mass-loss rates of
hot massive stars by several factors.
We calculated stellar evolution models using two sets of
mass-loss rates: one employing standard mass-loss recipes and
another using our newly derived rates to explore how they impact
stellar evolution and their final outcomes. The comparison high-
lights that the standard mass-loss rates overestimate mass loss
even during the main sequence. This overestimation may con-
tribute to the long-standing mass-discrepancy problem, where
spectroscopic and evolutionary mass estimates diverge. The en-
hanced accuracy of our mass-loss rates also provides an opportu-
nity to refine mixing efficiency parameters, which play a critical
role in determining stellar structure and evolution.
To bypass uncertainties associated with advanced evolution-
ary stages, we computed a small test set of binary evolutionary
models using either mass-loss recipes. Interestingly, the models
with our mass-loss rates did not produce WC-type stars within
the explored parameter space. Whether this is due to the limited
initial parameter selection, the calibration of mixing efficiencies,
or another factor remains subject to future work. However, our
models effectively explain the lack of H-free WN-type stars at
low metallicity, where models with standard mass-loss rates fall
short. The inclusion of our new empiric mass-loss recipe has
profound implications for the feedback mechanisms, ionizing
flux, and final evolutionary outcomes of massive stars in low-
metallicity environments as in the young Universe.
