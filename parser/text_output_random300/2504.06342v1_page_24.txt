drives small-scale dynamo action and mag-
netic field amplification, while AGN jets can
accelerate cosmic rays. These effects will be
incorporated in forthcoming work, including
Xia et al. (in prep).
4.4. On going and future work
In line with the main results presented above,
a subsequent study will focus on the underlying
physical mechanisms driving the observed proper-
ties in this study, particularly how turbulence and
radiative cooling cooperating with feedback chan-
nels modulate the gas supply for both black hole
accretion and star formation. Near-term develop-
ments of the MACER3D framework include im-
plementing AGN jets in hot mode feedback (Guo
et al., in prep) and incorporating magnetic fields
(Xia et al., in prep). The framework will be ex-
tended to simulate disk galaxies (Zou et al., in prep)
and dwarf galaxies (Su et al., in prep) to investi-
gate AGN feedback across different galactic envi-
ronments. Longer-term goals include implement-
ing cosmic rays and other potentially important
physics, improving CGM resolution, and incorpo-
rating cosmological inflows. These enhancements
will enable more comprehensive studies of AGN
feedback’s role in galaxy evolution while maintain-
ing the framework’s idealized nature for controlled
physical investigation.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We dedicate this work to the memory of Profes-
sor Jeremiah P. Ostriker. The MACER model was
developed step by step upon the foundation laid
by his pioneering work and benefited greatly from
his long-standing support and encouragement. In
particular, FY is deeply grateful for his mentorship
over the decades, which shaped much of his re-
search path and especially inspired FY to enter the
field of AGN feedback.

structive comments and suggestions that helped
