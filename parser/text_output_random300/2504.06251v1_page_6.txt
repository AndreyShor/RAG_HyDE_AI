Fig.
1 | Schematics and characterization of R5G/BN heterostructures (sample S1).
a,
Schematic illustration of NanoARPES experiments. b,c, Schematic illustration of flat bands in
non-aligned (b) and aligned (c) R5G/BN. d, Optical image of aligned R5G/BN sample S1, where
RG, Bernal stacking graphene and Au electrodes are marked by red, gray, and orange curves. e,
SNOM image, where the dark brown region corresponds to RG. f, Lateral-force AFM image re-
veals the moir´e period λm = 14.0 ± 0.3 nm for aligned R5G/BN.
