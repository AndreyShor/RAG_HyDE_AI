Problem Instances Background
B.1
Random QUBOs
Random QUBO problem instances are obtained by randomly generating symmetric matrices 𝑄∈R16×16. The
elements of the upper-triangle of 𝑄(i.e. 𝑄𝑖𝑗with 𝑖≤𝑗) are decided by taking independent samples from a fixed
distribution; we consider two choices for the distribution below:
• the (continuous) uniform distribution on [−1, 1], and
• the (discrete) uniform distribution on {−1, 1}.
The remaining elements of each matrix 𝑄(i.e. 𝑄𝑖𝑗with 𝑖> 𝑗) are then uniquely determined due to the requirement
that 𝑄be symmetric.
B.2
Travelling Salesman
Given a graph 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸) with adjacency matrix 𝐴, the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) [21] is finding the
Hamiltonian cycle of 𝐺with the smallest total edge weight. Because the Hamiltonian Cycle problem is itself
NP-Hard [22], the TSP problem is NP-Hard as well. Expansions of TSP have applications to various applications
such as Vehicle Routing [23], Disaster Retrieval [24], and Equitable Routing [25].
Following [26], we focus on the case of fully connected symmetric TSP, corresponding to complete undirected
graphs. A given sequence of vertices can be encoding using binary decision variables 𝑥∈{0, 1}|𝑉|2, where (for
0 ≤𝑖,𝑡< |𝑉| ) 𝑥|𝑉|𝑡+𝑖:= 𝑥𝑡,𝑖= 1 if and only if vertex 𝑖is visited at time 𝑡. The optimal sequence of vertices for a
