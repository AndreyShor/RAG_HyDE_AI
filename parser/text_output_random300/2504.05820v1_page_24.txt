Depending on the experimental setup, which can assume different spin configurations polar-
ized DIS cross-sections are often reported as asymmetries or normalized to the unpolarized
counterparts [38] (cf. Section 5.1.1).
Eventually, in order to show how it is possible to compute predictions about the behavior of
structure functions using perturbative QCD, we now have to introduce the parton model and
collinear factorization.
1.2.2. The parton model and QCD
At energies exceeding the proton mass (E ≈2mp GeV), the measured cross-section of electron-
proton scattering indicates that the structure of the proton is composed of point-like particles.
Based on this observation a naive parton model was derived by Feynman [39, 40] even before
QCD became a well adopted framework. In this section we show how the leading-order (LO)
parton model can explain the observed Bjorken scaling of the DIS structure functions and
provide an intuitive definition of Parton Distribution functions (PDFs).
Let’s suppose that hadrons are made up of constituents, called partons [41], which become
somehow weakly interacting at high energy scales Q →∞, and that the probing leptons scatter
on them incoherently. We can then modify the scattering process of Eq. (1.12) to be
ℓ(k) + q(ξP) →ℓ′(k′) + X ,
(1.36)
where now we have substituted the full proton by a parton q with momentum pq = ξP with
ξ ∈(0, 1]. In analogy to the derivation of Section 1.2.1 define the partonic momentum fraction
