This equation gives explicit criteria on B necessary to ensure stability of the disclination curves. The
equation sheds light on the physical parameter-dependent behavior of curves for different control
parameters, as we will see next.
Control Parameters
We turn to demonstrate explicit formulae for patterning cells that give rise to desired families of
curves, for different physical control parameters β that are of common use in the literature (Fig. 3).

Figure 3: Control parameters. Given an input family of curves, and depending on the available
control parameter – temperature (top), plate rotation (middle), or plate translation (bottom) –
the top and bottom surface patterns are calculated (eqs. (13), (16), and (18), respectively). Back-
ground color expresses meeting the stability criteria for each scenario (eqs. (15), (17), and (20),
respectively); systems with rotating or translating plates can realize the cat curves in this example,
however a system with only changing temperature cannot.
I. Temperature
We choose the control parameter β to be the smoothing scale λ associated with line tension. This
parameter can be controlled via the temperature – see [23] (one may also choose β to be the cell
thickness h, which is mathematically equivalent). In this case, the force f = λκ + f
