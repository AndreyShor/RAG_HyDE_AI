FIG. 6. Bulk and Josephson topological characterizations for 2M WS2. (a) The side view of conventional cell. (b) The bulk
band structure along a high symmetry path in k space. (c) The bulk Brillouin zones (BZs) for primitive cell and the projected
BZs for (100) and (001) planes.
The topological surface states for (d) (100) plane and (e) (001) plane.
µ-dependent gap
distributions of Andreev bound states in a (001) Josephson π junction along (f) N-Γ-N and (g) Y-Γ-Y paths. (h) The E-µ
diagram of (001) π junction for Γ point (red circles) and M point (blue circles). The inversion symmetry indicator κ is 1 in
the gray region (topologically nontrivial zone) and 0 in the other regions (topologically trivial zone). (i) Wilson-loop spectrum
for the π junction at µ = 0 along ky, where clearly shows a helical winding pattern that agrees with κ = 1. Zoom-in plots are
shown in (j) for θ = π and in (k) for θ = −π, where θ denotes the Wannier centers.
(f), both at Γ, where the corresponding critical chemical
potentials are µ(1)
Γ
= 0.104 eV and µ(2)
Γ
= −0.388 eV.
A few other local gap minima are found to exist away
from Γ, while none of them represent a true gap clos-
ing. Physically, the bulk-state origin of JT transitions
at Γ is exactly the TI-like band inversion at Γ, which is
reminiscent of the Fu-Kane paradigm.
Surprisingly, Fig. 6 (g) also reveals an unexpected JT
transition at Y with a µY = −0.025 eV. This JT transi-
tion at Y is thus not due to the Z2 topology of electrons
around Γ. Geometrically, we find that this Y -transition
can be traced back to the bulk electrons at L. Remark-
ably, this JT criticality arises exactly when the Fermi
level crosses the band bottom of L pocket. While the
microscopic nature of this Y -transition is an intriguing
open question, it is beyond the scope of this work and
will be left for future discussions.
To better visualize the JT phase diagram, we merge
the µ-varying energy dispersions for Γ (red dots) and Y
(blue dots) into Fig. 6 (h), which displays four regions
separated by the JT critical points. To characterize the
JT for each region, we compute the Z4 indicator κ by
calculating the inversion eigenvalues for all 22,000 states
below zero energy for all TRIMs in the (001) projected
BZ. Remarkably, we find that

where µ is in the unit of eV. As a complementary check,
we further carry out a large-scale Wilson-loop calculation
for H[001], again taking into account all occupied states
of the junction Hamiltonian. The Wilson loop spectrum
at µ = 0 is shown in Figs. 6 (i) - (k), whose gapless helical
winding pattern unambiguously informs ν0 = 1. We thus
numerically conclude that:
(i) π-junction of an undoped 2M-WS2 with µ = 0 is
Z2 topological.
(ii) Undoped 2M-WS2 carries vortex MZMs.
