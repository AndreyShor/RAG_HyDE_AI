transitions in otherwise symmetry-protected regimes.
This makes them key enablers for
modulating the linear and nonlinear optical response of graphene-based devices.
Figure 2 presents the variations in the linear optical absorption coefficient as a function
of photon energy for four different polar substrates: h-BN, SiC, SiO2, and HfO2. Panel
(a) shows the absorption response in the presence of the polaron effect alone (F = 0), while
panel (b) includes the influence of an applied in-plane electric field (F = 0.3 V/nm). In
each case, results are shown for three different magnetic field strengths: B = 0.05, 0.07, and
0.1 T.
Figure 2: Linear optical absorption coefficient as a function of photon energy for different
polar substrates: h-BN, SiC, SiO2, and HfO2, under various magnetic field strengths (B =
0.05, 0.07, and 0.1 T). (a) Absorption spectra without electric field (F = 0); (b) with in-
plane electric field (F = 0.3 V/nm).
In Figure 2(a), which represents the case without an applied electric field (F = 0), the
linear optical absorption spectra reveals the influence of the magnetic field on the polaron-
induced optical transitions. For all substrates, increasing the magnetic field from 0.05T to
0.1T results in a gradual blue shift of the absorption peaks and a noticeable increase in peak
