Here, ∆quantiﬁes the violation of the Leibniz rule and is deﬁned by:
∆(A, B; C) ≡A[B, ∂C
∂σ3 ] −B[A, ∂C
∂σ3 ].
(3.10)
A similar discussion is presented in Sakakibara’s work [21]. In the present paper,
it is found that the discrepancy ∆(A, B; C) vanishes when C is independent of
σ3.
This behavior impacts the composition of transformations, leading to the
following relation:
[τ(Q1, Q2),τ(H1, H2)] =
τ([τ(Q1, Q2), H1], H2) + τ(H1, [τ(Q1, Q2), H2]) + ∆(H1, H2; τ(Q1, Q2)).
(3.11)
The deviation caused by the incomplete Leibniz rule is proportional to ∆.
To eliminate this discrepancy, we must impose a restriction on the gauge
parameters such that:
∂τ(Q1, Q2)
∂σ3
= 0.
(3.12)
This condition eﬀectively removes the σ3 dependence from the volume-preserving
deformation, ensuring the consistency of the transformation composition.
Focusing on the term {τ(Q1, Q2), XI} implies that the remaining terms must
also satisfy a gauge parameter restriction such that:
∂XI
∂σ3 {Q1, Q2} + Σ(Q1, Q2; XI) = 0.
(3.13)
Additionally, considering the condition for charge preservation:
δR(Q1,Q2)Q1,2 = 0,
(3.14)
it becomes clear that the previous conditions must individually hold as:
{Q1, Q2} = 0,
(3.15)
Σ(Q1, Q2; XI) = 0.
(3.16)
Consequently, the problem transforms into an inverse problem, where we seek
an appropriate gauge-ﬁxing condition that can impose the following restrictions
on the gauge parameters:
∂τ(Q1, Q2)
∂σ3
= 0,
(3.17)
{Q1, Q2} = 0,
(3.18)
Σ(Q1, Q2; XI) = 0.
