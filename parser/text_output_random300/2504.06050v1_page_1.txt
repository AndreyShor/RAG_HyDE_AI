Abstract:  
 
Phonon polaritons (PhPs), excitations arising from the coupling of light with lattice vibrations, 
enable light confinement and local field enhancement, which is essential for various photonic and 
thermal applications. To date, PhPs with high confinement and low loss have been mainly 
observed in the mid-infrared regime and mostly in manually exfoliated flakes of van der Waals 
(vdW) materials. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of low-loss, thickness-tunable phonon 
polaritons in the far-infrared regime within transferable free-standing SrTiO3 membranes 
synthesized through a scalable approach, achieving high figures of merit, which are comparable to 
the previous record values from the vdW materials. Leveraging atomic precision in thickness 
control, large dimensions, and compatibility with mature oxide electronics, functional oxide 
membranes present a promising large-scale two-dimensional (2D) platform alternative to vdW 
materials for on-chip polaritonic technologies in the far-infrared regime.
