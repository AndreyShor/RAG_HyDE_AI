SUMMARY
As an unified theory, QCD reveals us an image of
strong interactions. Especially, the global property of the
coupling constants in it makes us believe that, if we can
reproduce some necessary parts of the physical phenom-
ena in strong region, with the fixed parameters, maybe
we can have a chance to get a whole picture.
Guided by this idea, we take a look into the spectra
of light hybrids with exotic quantum number 1−+ as
our first step, where the hybrid is treated as a three-
body system and the gluon becomes the constituent
gluon. After taking the mass of the constituent gluon
as mg ≈
1
2mp ≈450 MeV [55–57], with GEM method,
we make a numerical calculation on the spectra at first.
The results show that, as long as we add into the con-
stituent gluon mass as the final piece, by just using the
same model parameters get from meson spectra calcula-
tions [1–3], we can immediately get the same conclusion
on the light 1−+ hybrid spectra, especially for ground
states [46, 50].
Then, using the wave functions, we calculate the par-
tial decay widths of the ground light 1−+ hybrids with a
transition operator coming from the quark-gluon vertex.
It shows that almost all the results are consistent with
Refs. [], which, in our view, also reflects the unification
of potential model. Based on our numerical results, we
find that we still cannot explain π1(1600) and η1(1855)
as 1−+ hybrids simultaneously due to the total width,
and the η1(1855) may not be a hybrid since its decay
width to ηη′ at leading order is almost zero. In addition,
K1(1270) ¯K and K1(1270)π channels may be the golden
channels to search for the isospin-0 and isospin- 1
2 hybrid
respectively. Furthermore, there exists another η1(1640),
and future experiments such as BESIII can search the
a1(1260)π channel to verify it.

Deriving the potential between quark and gluon
To derive the potential between quark and gluon, We
can start from the QCD Lagrangian, which is usually
written as
LQCD = ¯ψi(iγµDµ −mi)ψi −1
4Ga
µνGaµν,
(18)
where ψi is the quark field, mi is the quark mass, Dµ =
∂µ −igsGa
µT a is the covariant derivative, Ga
µν = ∂µGa
ν −
∂νGa
µ+gsf abcGb
µGc
ν is the gluon field strength tensor, T a
is the generator of SU(3) group, and f abc is the structure
constant of SU(3) group.
From this Lagrangian, the Feynman rules of 3-gluons-
vertex and quark-gluon interaction can be derived, which
can be expressed as follows,
