Evidence for Intrinsic charm in the proton

LHC [268] with the fixed-target programs of LHCb [269, 270] and ALICE [271] in the forward
region; the Forward Physics Facility [231, 124] with the proposed experiments FASERÎ½ [272],
SND@LHC [273]; the Electron Ion Collider and neutrino telescopes [274].
We refer to Section 4.3.4 for a discussion about the impact of N3LO corrections ind DGLAP
evolution, on intrinsic charm, as well as the effect of additional N3LO matching conditions not
available by the time of writing [101]. These have mainly the effect of reduce some of the
theory uncertainties affecting the current determination.
