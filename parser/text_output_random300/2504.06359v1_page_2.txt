aiming at a thorough monitoring of user communications.
In this paper, we introduce it to quantum communica-
tion and refer to it as the controller in classical, quantum,
and post-quantum cryptography.
In public key cryptography, the controller is deﬁned
as a traditional adversary who further possesses users’
private keys [22, 23], violating the fundamental assump-
tion of public key cryptography that user private keys
are kept secret.
In this paper, we consider an even more powerful
controller who controls the entire communication infras-
tructure, including both classical and quantum channels.
This controller can force users to submit any local secrets
for which it has evidence of existence. Additionally, it is
itself a quantum computer.
More speciﬁcally, anticipating future challenges, we en-
vision an extremely powerful controller who is not satis-
ﬁed with merely possessing users’ private keys in pub-
lic key cryptography.
This controller completely bans
both classical and post-quantum public key cryptogra-
phy and further seeks to control quantum communica-
tion. Such a controller is a plausible scenario within the
next 30 years, particularly in specialized contexts like
low-frequency and high-security environments.
We analyze how this controller could undermine ex-
isting quantum protocols and how users could achieve
covert communication under its control.
We will call the users Alice and Bob, the eavesdropper
Eve, and the controller Colin.

COVERT COMMUNICATION IN BB84
Unlike public key cryptography, there is no clear or
general concepts of public or private keys in quantum
communication. Hence the deﬁnition of the dictator [22]
in public key cryptography does not naturally extend to
quantum communication.
For quantum communication, it is perhaps more ap-
propriate to deﬁne the controller in terms of speciﬁc pro-
tocols or speciﬁc types of protocols.
A.
Controller for BB84
We take BB84 [19] as an example and see what the
controller can do to control quantum communication.
BB84 was the ﬁrst quantum cryptography protocol
ever invented.
The main idea of BB84 is to agree on
random photon states through random basis matching.
It runs as follows:
1. Quantum Transmission Phase:
• Alice generates two random strings a
=
(a1, . . . , an) ∈{0, 1}n (basis selection string)
and b = (b1, . . . , bn) ∈{0, 1}n (state se-
lection string), prepares a sequence of pho-
tons |ϕa1b1⟩, . . . , |ϕanbn⟩such that |ϕ00⟩= |0⟩,
|ϕ01⟩= |1⟩, |ϕ10⟩= |+⟩, and |ϕ11⟩= |−⟩, and
sends them to Bob over a quantum channel.
• Bob generates a random basis selection string
a′ = (a′
1, . . . , a′
n) ∈{0, 1}n and measures
each photon |ϕaibi⟩in the computation basis
{|0⟩, |1⟩} if a′
i = 0 or in the Hadamard basis
{|+⟩, |−⟩} if a′
i = 1, resulting in a state char-
acteristic string b′ = (b′
1, . . . , b′
n) where b′
i = 0
if |ϕaibi⟩= |0⟩or |+⟩, or b′
i = 1 if |ϕaibi⟩= |1⟩
or |−⟩.
2. Parameter Estimation Phase:
• Alice and Bob disclose their basis selection
strings a and a′ in a classical channel, dis-
card the bits in b and b′ where a and a′ do
not match, resulting in substrings c ∈{0, 1}k
and c′ ∈{0, 1}k of b and b′.
• Alice randomly parses c into substrings d ∈
{0, 1}k1 and e ∈{0, 1}k2, where k1 < k2, and
discloses the positions of d to Bob.
• Bob parses c′ in the same way to get the cor-
responding substrings d′ and e′ of c′.
• Alice and Bob disclose d and d′ to calculate
and estimate the error rate.
3. Key Reconciliation Phase:
• If the error rate is not higher than a predeﬁned
threshold t, they use information reconcilia-
tion (e.g., an error correcting code) to turn e
and e′ into a shared secret s and then use pri-
vacy ampliﬁcation (e.g., a hash function) to
turn s into a shared key K; otherwise if the
error rate is higher than t, they abandon this
communication.
Note that there are three main secrets in BB84:
1. the ﬁnal shared secret s;
2. the state selection string b;
3. the basis selection string a.
We deﬁne three controllers to demand one of the three
secrets respectively. Speciﬁcally:
Controller I: The ﬁrst controller demands s from
Alice and Bob after the BB84 execution is com-
pleted;
Controller II: The second controller demands Al-
ice’s b before she sends photons to Bob;
Controller III: The third controller demands Al-
ice’s a before she sends photons to Bob.
