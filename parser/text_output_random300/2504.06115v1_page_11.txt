of [16, Proposition 3.3], one can then show that for any analytic small resolution b
Xa of
Xa one has
H2( b
Xa, Z) = H2( b
Xr
a, Z)/⟨{ [Cp], p ∈Sr,B
a
}⟩.
(2.7)
As a result, we ﬁnd that the exceptional curves in any small resolution b
Xa of Xa
represent non-trivial torsion classes in homology and Xa does not admit any K¨ahler
small resolution.
The relation between the geometries is summarized in Figure 1.
Existence of partial smoothing
Let us brieﬂy explain the existence of a deformation Xa
of Xr
a that removes only the nodes of Type B. In all of our examples, the exceptional curves
that resolve the nodes Sr,B
a
satisfy a relation in homology
X
p∈Sr,B
a
ap[Cp] = 0 ∈H2( b
Xr
a, Z) ,
(2.8)
with all coeﬃcients ap ̸= 0. We denote by X
r
a an analytic variety that is obtained by small
resolving only the nodes of Type A, Sr,A
a
⊂Xr
a. Any of the 2#Sr,A
a
choices will work for us.
We can then apply the results from [45–48], as summarized for example in the introduction
of [49], to conclude that there exists a smoothing b
Xa of X
r
a. After contracting the remaining
exceptional curves we then obtain the almost generic Calabi-Yau threefold Xa.
To be clear, this argument allows us to conclude the existence of the Calabi-Yau Xa and
to deduce its relevant properties. We will not identify the explicit deformations of the deﬁning
equations that remove the nodes of Type B while preserving those of Type A, as has been
possible in the case of symmetric determinantal double octics, studied in [16]. It would be
very interesting to identify the explicit form of the deﬁning equations of the geometries Xa
but we will leave this question for future work.
Torsion of partial smoothing
Given the homology classes of the exceptional curves Cp
for p ∈Sr,B
a , it is easy to calculate the torsion of Xa. For the moment, let r = b2( b
Xr
a). In all
of our examples the lattice
⟨{ [Cp], p ∈Sr,B
a
}⟩⊂H2( b
Xr
a, Z) ≃Zr
(2.9)
has rank r −1, and is generated by elements ⃗vi = (0, vi,1, . . . , vi,r−1) for i = 1, . . . , r −1. As
a result, the homology of b
Xa takes the form
H2( b
Xa, Z) = Z × B(Xa) ,
B(Xa) = ZN ,
(2.10)
with the order of torsion being
N = det
