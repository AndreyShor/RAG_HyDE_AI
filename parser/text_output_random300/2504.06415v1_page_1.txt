ABSTRACT
We preform a systematic search for galactic-scale quasar pairs and small-scale (< 3′′) lenses using the
SDSS DR16 quasar catalog and Gaia DR3. Candidate double quasars (both are unobscured) are iden-
tified as Gaia resolved pairs around spectroscopically confirmed SDSS quasars (Lbol > 1044.5 erg s−1)
at 0.5 < z ≲4.5. Gaia astrometric information and SDSS spectral decomposition are used to exclude
foreground star superpositions, which dominate (≳80% of) the pair sample. We identify 136 double
quasar candidates from 1120 Gaia-resolved pairs after a magnitude and redshift cut of G < 20.5 and
z > 0.5 (803 double quasars out of 2,497 pairs without any cuts applied) with separations of ∼0.′′3−3′′,
corresponding to projected physical separations of ∼3 −30 kpc at the median redshift of the sample
of z = 1.7. We estimate an overall double quasar (lens and physical pairs combined) fraction using
this sample, corrected for pair-resolving completeness, of 5.7+0.3
−0.3 × 10−4 (bootstrapping errors). This
double quasar fraction increases toward smaller separations, consistent with earlier findings. We also
find little redshift evolution of the double quasar fraction for the luminous SDSS sample, consistent
with previous observations and simulation predictions. However, the observed fraction is lower than
simulation predictions by ∼0.8 - 1.6 dex, suggesting a significant population of obscured quasar pairs
are missed in our search. Future wide-area space missions targeting both unobscured and obscured
quasar pairs at sub-arcsec resolutions will reveal this population of obscured quasar pairs, and extend
to much lower AGN luminosities.

1. INTRODUCTION
The statistics of galactic-scale, i.e., with projected pair
separations of ≲30 kpc, dual supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) critically constrain the dynamical evolution of
pairs of SMBHs following the merger of their host galax-
ies. This is the progenitor population of gravitationally
bound SMBHs at ≲few parsec scales, whose eventual
coalescence produces the loudest low-frequency gravi-
tational waves (GW) to be detected with future GW
facilities (e.g., Kelley et al. 2017; Amaro-Seoane et al.
2023).
Over the past few years, there has been sig-
nificant progress in both theoretical and observational
studies of galactic-scale dual SMBHs. On the theoreti-
cal side, state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations with

large volume are starting to produce sufficient statistics
to predict the abundance and evolution of dual SMBHs
and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) over cosmic time (e.g.,
Chen et al. 2023a; Li et al. 2023b; Di Matteo et al. 2023;
Saeedzadeh et al. 2024; Puerto-S´anchez et al. 2025). On
the observational side, large-area sky surveys with imag-
ing and spectroscopy are producing a large number of
candidate dual AGNs to be compared with simulation
predictions (e.g., Sandoval et al. 2023; Pfeifle et al. 2024;
Li et al. 2024).
While a full comparison between observations and
simulations is still lacking, recent studies have shown
promise in reaching a consensus on the evolution of the
dual SMBH population: (i) both observations and sim-
ulations suggest that the fraction of dual AGNs among
the parent AGN population increases with decreasing
AGN luminosity (e.g., Chen et al. 2023a); (ii) a signifi-
