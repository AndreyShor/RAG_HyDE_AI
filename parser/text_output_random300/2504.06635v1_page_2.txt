Introduction
Dyons, which are a natural extension of monopoles, are essentially monopoles that also
carry a nonzero electric charge. Schwinger [1] initially proposed them as an alternative
to quarks, and also their quantum mechanical properties were ﬁrst explored by Zwanziger
[2, 3]. Similar to monopoles, dyons naturally arise in non-Abelian gauge theory. The ﬁrst
demonstration of monopole existence was provided by Polyakov [4] and ’t Hooft [5] in the
SU(2) Yang–Mills–Higgs (YMH) model. Later, Julia and Zee [6] showed that dyons can
also exist within the same framework.
Prasad and Sommerﬁeld [7] then proposed explicit solutions for the ’t Hooft-Polyakov
monopoles and Julia-Zee dyons by considering a special limit of the model. These solutions
satisfy a set of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations, known as Bogomolny’s equations, derived
by Bogomolny [8]. The solutions to these sets of equations satisfy the nontrivial static
energy bound, which is proportional to the topological charge.
Recent studies of monopoles and dyons have introduced new features and dynamics.
Some of these investigations have focused on modifying the SU(2) YMH model.
One
approach involves introducing additional degrees of freedom along with additional global
symmetries [9]. Another study proposed modifying the SU(2) YMH model by incorporating
scalar ﬁeld-dependent coupling into each kinetic term [10]. This modiﬁed version, referred
to as the generalized SU(2) YMH model, allows monopoles to possess internal structures
[11].
Recently, in [12], Atmaja proposed a method to generalize BPS monopoles and
