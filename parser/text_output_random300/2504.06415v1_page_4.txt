pact Gaia proper motion measurements. The imposed
z > 0.5 redshift cut ensures we have a cleaner and more
complete double quasar sample than the one without a
redshift restriction.
Our G < 20.5 flux limit roughly corresponds to a
quasar bolometric luminosity Lbol > 1044.5 erg s−1 at
z > 0.5, or SDSS i < 20.38 if we adopt a magnitude con-
version of G = i + 0.12 assuming a fixed quasar power-
law continuum fν ∝ν−0.5 (Shen et al. 2011). The ini-
tial DR16Q quasar sample satisfying these redshift and
magnitude cuts and having single Gaia matches contains
302,940 DR16Q quasars. And the “parent pair sample”
limiting to z > 0.5 and G < 20.5 contains 1,120 unique
pairs, including 162 quasar-like and 958 starlike com-
panions, as listed in Table 1. The following statistical
analyses will primarily focus on the parent pair sample
with z > 0.5 and G < 20.5, as it is considered more reli-
able based on the discussions above. For completeness,
we also include the number of candidate double quasars
and quasar-star pairs at z ≤0.5, or G ≥20.5 in Table
1, though the purity of these candidate pairs at fainter
luminosities and/or lower redshifts is significantly lower.
As a check, when we apply the same redshift and mag-
nitude cuts, we reproduce the pair sample in Shen et al.
(2023a) based on Gaia EDR3. This is expected as there
is minimal difference in the astrometric measurements
between Gaia DR3 and EDR3.
2.2. The Pair Sample
2.2.1. Color, Separation and Magnitude Distributions
To evaluate the quality of proper motion classification,
several statistical properties for the parent pair sample
with z > 0.5 and G < 20.5 are presented in Figures 4
and 5. Figure 4 (left) shows the distributions of Gaia BP
- RP colors for the matched DR16Q quasars in pairs and
their starlike and quasar-like companions from the full
Gaia pair catalog. We excluded pairs with separations
less than 1′′ to avoid crosstalk in color measurements,
because Gaia photometry, measured within a 3.′′5 × 2.′′1
window (Riello et al. 2021), could significantly affect
deblending for the closest pairs.
The left panel of Figure 4 shows that the color dis-
tribution of starlike companions, as classified by Gaia
proper-motion detection, differs from that of the pri-
mary DR16Q matched quasars or quasar-like compan-
ions.
Additionally, the color distributions of both
DR16Q quasars in pairs and quasar-like companions are
concentrated toward the blue end, although the distri-
bution for quasar-like companions is broader. The right
panel of Figure 4 presents the distribution of pair separa-
tions for starlike and quasar-like companions. The num-
ber of starlike companions decreases rapidly at smaller

Figure 1. Distribution of the significance of proper motion
(PMSIG) for different samples. The black and blue distribu-
tions represent matched SDSS DR16Q quasars without any
cut and with a magnitude cut of G < 20.5, respectively. The
green and orange distributions correspond to matched SDSS
stars without any cut and with G < 20.5, respectively. The
purple distribution represents newly matched sources ob-
tained by shifting the positions of the initial matched DR16Q
quasar sample by 10′′ and crossmatching with the Gaia DR3
database, as discussed in Section 2.3. The red dashed line
represents PMSIG = 3.
Sources with no reported proper
motion measurements (i.e., PM = NA) have their PMSIG
set to 0, and sources with PMSIG > 30 are not shown here
for clarity. The fraction of sources with PMSIG > 3 for each
sample is also presented. The magnitude cut here is applied
to mitigate the influence of photometric incompleteness (see
Section 2.1).
separations, as expected due to the reduction in geomet-
ric cross-section and the constant sky density of the fore-
ground (star) population. However, this trend may also
be influenced by pair-resolving incompleteness at sepa-
rations ≲1′′. In contrast, the distribution for quasar-
like companions is relatively flat, suggesting an intrinsic
population associated with the primary quasar.
Given the differences in color and separation distri-
butions (Shen et al. 2023a), the classification based on
proper motion effectively removes most stellar contam-
ination, resulting in a larger and relatively pure double
quasar sample even with relaxed redshift and magnitude
thresholds than those used in Shen et al. (2023a). How-
ever, the broader color distribution of quasar-like com-
panions suggests residual stellar contamination due to
the relaxed magnitude and redshift cuts, though it may
also result from a population of dust-reddened quasars
in pairs with redder spectra than typical SDSS broad-
line quasars.
