which is indeed the fundamental period of the mirror of e
X3.
Taking on the other hand the limit z →1, we observe that only the complexiﬁed volume
along the curves that resolve the nodes of Type B is trivial. The other exceptional curves mea-
sure a non-trivial B-ﬁeld holonomy of ±1/3 and the nodes of Type A are therefore protected
against deformation. The mirror fundamental period that one obtains after the transition
can be obtained by taking the limit

and is annihilated by the Picard-Fuchs operator AESZ 199 (B.53). We can therefore inter-
pret this operator as annihilating the periods of the mirror of the Calabi-Yau background
(X3, [±1]3).
The transition b

The mirror transition of the conifold transition b

period of the mirror of b

this as corresponding to the mirror of the Calabi-Yau background (X4, [±1]3).

A degeneration of X(6,6) with 50 nodes and Z5-torsion
Our ﬁnal example, the almost generic Calabi-Yau threefold X5 with torsion B(X5) = Z5, will
not be constructed by following a conifold transition. Instead, we will deduce the existence of
this Q-factorial degeneration of the generic complete intersection X(6,6) ⊂P5
1,1,2,2,3,3, as well
as its properties, directly from an irrational Picard-Fuchs operator.
