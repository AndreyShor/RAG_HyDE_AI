Local structure of extremal points

since Î¥b,g(0) = 0, we have shown that on the event E2 there exists x âˆˆRd with |x| â‰¥rÎ· such that
Î¥b,g(x) â‰¥0. Since we are on the event {Kb < log rÎ·}, thanks to Lemma 4.9, there must be some
l â‰¥log rÎ· such that Bl â‰¤Î» + 2Rlog rÎ·(l).
Similarly, the condition S1 â‰¤(log Î·)4 implies that,
E2 âŠ†

iâˆˆ[d]
|âˆ‚iÎ¥b,g(0)| â‰²Î·âˆ’1

Otherwise, one could find a point z âˆˆRd at distance of order Î·âˆ’1/d from the origin such that
Î¥b,g(z) â‰³Î·âˆ’2/d(log Î·)4, which implies that the values of Î¥b,g inside a ball of radius Î·âˆ’1/d around
z are all positive. But since we are on the event {M0,b(Î¥b,g) â‰¤Î»}, these points are contained in
DÎ»
0,j(Î¥b,g), leading again to a contradiction.
Now, we note that, thanks to (K1), it holds that the gradient of K at the origin is zero, and so âˆ‚iÎ¥b,g(0)
is independent of B. Combining these considerations with (4.63), it follows that
P0,u,b(E2) â‰¤P0,u,b

We can now apply Lemma A.11 to bound the second probability, showing that for j0 â‰¥0 sufficiently
large, b â‰¥j0 sufficiently large, and for any j âˆˆ[j0, b], it holds that
P0,u,b(E2) â‰²u

In order to bound the remaining factor, we note that âˆ‚iÎ¥b,g(0) = âˆ‚iZb(0) + âˆ‚igb(0) and that, by (3.13),
E[âˆ‚iZb(0)âˆ‚jZb(0)] = âˆ’âˆ‚2

Since (âˆ‚iZb(0))iâˆˆ[d] are jointly Gaussian, it follows from Remark 1.2 and (4.67) that

(4.68)
uniformly over b â‰¥0 and u âˆˆ[b1/4, b3/4]. Therefore, we conclude that (4.6) is bounded by some
constant times (u/b)Î·âˆ’(1+Î´) for any Î´ âˆˆ(0, 1/(16d)).
To conclude, we note that (4.54) follows immediately from (4.53).
We also need the following version of Lemma 4.22, where the end point of the Brownian bridge is
taken to be less than b1/4.
Lemma 4.27. Let A > 0 be fixed. There exists Î´ = Î´(d) âˆˆ(0, 1) such that for any b â‰¥0 sufficiently
large, it holds for any Î» > 0, u âˆˆ[âˆ’A, b1/4], and Î· â‰¥0,
