of a Physical Property Measurement System (DynaCool, Quantum Design) system, which 
can provide the environment of high three-dimensional vector magnetic fields and varied 
temperatures. To study the Joule heating effect at high current densities during SOT 
switching, we conduct the finite element analysis (FEA) simulation and find the 
temperature increase at the switching current density of 21.8 MA/cm2 is ~5 K (see 
Supplementary Note 12). 
Macrospin simulations 
The macrospin simulations are based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, 
which includes damping-like SOTs. This can be expressed as: 
d𝒎𝒎ෝ𝒊𝒊
d𝑡𝑡−𝛼𝛼𝒎𝒎ෝ𝒊𝒊×
d𝒎𝒎ෝ𝒊𝒊
d𝑡𝑡=
−𝛾𝛾𝒎𝒎ෝ𝒊𝒊× 𝑯𝑯eff. In the static simulations, we solve the equilibrium equations: 𝒎𝒎ෝ𝒊𝒊× 𝑯𝑯eff =
0 using Newton’s method. The magnetic parameters, such as the exchange field 𝐻𝐻ex =
1/3𝐻𝐻an, are determined from experimental data. A fixed in-plane magnetic field 𝐻𝐻ext =
0.4𝐻𝐻an is applied in the simulations of SOT switching (Fig. 4a). 
In the dynamic simulations, we rewrite the LLG equation as: 
d𝒎𝒎ෝ𝒊𝒊
d𝑡𝑡= −
𝛾𝛾
1+𝛼𝛼2 ൫𝒎𝒎ෝ𝒊𝒊× 𝑯𝑯eff +
𝛼𝛼𝒎𝒎ෝ𝒊𝒊× (𝒎𝒎ෝ𝒊𝒊× 𝑯𝑯eff)൯. We assume that the magnetism of atoms mainly originates from 
electron spin, so the gyromagnetic ratio 𝛾𝛾 = 1.76×1011 T-1 s-1. A Gilbert damping constant 
of 𝛼𝛼= 0.1 is selected based on the reference literature48,49. The Heun method are employed 
during the simulation50. The time step of the simulation is controlled such that the 
maximum change in 𝒎𝒎ෝ𝒊𝒊 is less than 1 × 10−2. The SOT is introduced at 𝑡𝑡= 0 and persists 
long enough to induce switching. Additionally, the critical SOT values in the dynamic 
simulations are given from the static simulations.
