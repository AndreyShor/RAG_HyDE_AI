Figure 2: Magnetic and overlap scattering amplitudes for the random bond Ising model.
ai labels a particle excitation in the i-th replica of the a-th copy (a ̸= b, i ̸= j). Overlap
amplitudes involve diﬀerent copies. Time runs upwards.
scattering amplitudes energy independent. These simpliﬁcations of the scattering problem are
strong enough to make it exactly solvable, a circumstance that has been exploited to progress
with longstanding problems of two-dimensional criticality, both with [6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] and
without disorder [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36].
In this framework, the scattering particles correspond to the fundamental collective ex-
citation modes of the system, and the symmetry representation they carry characterizes the
model under consideration. In the present case, a = 1, 2, . . . , N labels the particle corre-
sponding to an elementary excitation in the a-th Ising copy; such a particle is odd under spin
reversal σ(a) →−σ(a), which is a symmetry of the Hamiltonian (8). In addition, an index
i = 1, 2, . . . , n labels the replicas associated to the disorder average. We then denote by ai a
particle in the i-th replica of the a-th Ising copy. The elastic scattering amplitudes allowed
by spin reversal symmetry and by permutational symmetry (of the N copies as well as of the
n replicas) are shown in Figure 2.
As for any scattering theory [37], the amplitudes satisfy crossing and unitarity equations,
which at two-dimensional ﬁxed points take a particularly simple form as a consequence of
complete elasticity and energy independence. With the notation Sγδ
