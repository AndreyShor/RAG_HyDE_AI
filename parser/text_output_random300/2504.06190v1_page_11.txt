1.2 Four-dimensional no-scale models

fermions, but the theoretical advantage of being more and more constrained
as N increases up to its maximal value N = 8. Therefore, they are important
theoretical laboratories to understand, for example, supersymmetry break-
ing at the classical and at the quantum level. It is a remarkable empirical
fact, certainly deserving a deeper understanding, that all known N > 1 su-
pergravity models with spontaneously broken supersymmetry and classically
vanishing vacuum energy are no-scale models. In the following, for simplicity,
we will consider only the cases N = 2, 4, 8.
Whilst the gravitational multiplet exhausts the field content of N = 8,
N = 4 can contain vector multiplets, and N = 2 can contain vector mul-
tiplets and hypermultiplets. The manifold of the scalar fields is E7/SU(8)
for N = 8, SU(1, 1)/U(1) × SO(6, n)/[SO(6) × SO(n)] for N = 4, and the
product of a special Kähler manifold and a quaternionic Kähler manifold
for N = 2. The only way to introduce a non-trivial scalar potential and the
spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is the gauging procedure (for recent
reviews and references, see e.g. [22, 23, 24]), which consists in promoting
a subgroup of the global isometry group of the scalar manifold to a local
symmetry. The non-linear action of the global isometries of the scalar mani-
fold is associated with an electric/magnetic duality action on the vector field
strengths and their duals [25], and thus is defined by the embedding inside
Sp(2n), if n is the number of vector fields. The general form of the scalar
potential V0, which extends (1.3) to N > 1, follows from [26, 27]:

B V0 = −3 SAC SBC + NIA NIB ,
(1.22)
where δψAµ = SABγµεB + . . . and δλI = NIAεA + . . . are the variations of
the gravitinos and of the spin-1/2 fermions under supersymmetry transfor-
mations, with NIA = (NIA)∗and SAB = SBA = (SAB)∗. As in the N = 1
case, V0 consists of two contributions: one is positive semidefinite and cor-
responds to the sum of the squares of the would-be auxiliary fields for the
non-gravitational multiplets, the other is negative semidefinite and propor-
tional to the squared gravitino mass matrix.
No-scale models exhibiting complete spontaneous breaking of extended
supesymmetry with vanishing classical vacuum energy can be associated, in
N = 2 [28, 29], N = 4 [30, 31, 32] and N = 8 [33, 34, 35] supergravity, with
the gauging of a non-compact subgroup of the duality group. If, in addition,
