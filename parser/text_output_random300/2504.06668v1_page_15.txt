minants—such as economic structures, cultural norms, and policy frame-
works—and catastrophic shocks, including financial crises, pandemics, and
armed conflicts. This analytical perspective is particularly relevant in under-
standing how small, incremental changes in socioeconomic conditions can, under
specific thresholds, culminate in abrupt fertility declines. Japan’s persistent
fertility decline exemplifies such a dynamic, wherein long-term socioeconomic
transformations—rising costs of child-rearing, shifts in gender norms, and labor
market rigidities—intersect with exogenous shocks to reinforce sub-replacement
fertility levels. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic that induced a global baby
bust (Kearney and Levine, 2023) contributed to a significant contraction in
birth rates across numerous advanced economies due to its related disruptions
in economic stability, healthcare accessibility, and work-life balance.
The
integration of catastrophe theory with fertility analysis suggests that while
structural factors drive long-term demographic trends, tipping points triggered
by acute crises can lead to sudden demographic shifts that are difficult to
reverse.
At the mesodemographic level, the model serves as a powerful tool for
dissecting fertility patterns within specific communities, bridging the gap
between national demographic trends and individual reproductive behaviors.
Fertility is not uniform across geographic and social contexts; rather, it is
shaped by local socioeconomic conditions, cultural expectations, and access to
reproductive healthcare. Regional disparities in fertility rates, evident within
countries with high spatial heterogeneity, highlight the relevance of meso-
level analysis. For instance, intra-national fertility variations in the United
States or sub-Saharan Africa can be attributed to differing levels of economic
development, healthcare infrastructure, and social capital. By examining the
interaction between local latent factors and potential catastrophic shocks, the
model facilitates targeted policy interventions that mitigate fertility crises in
vulnerable communities. Furthermore, the model is instrumental in analyzing
the fertility consequences of migration.
Shifts in population composition
due to migration alter social dynamics, influencing reproductive behaviors
within host communities. In this context, migration serves as both a driver of
fertility adaptation and a mechanism for demographic stabilization in regions
experiencing population decline.
At the microdemographic level, the model provides insight into fertility
decision-making at the individual and household levels, particularly in contexts
of heightened vulnerability. A compelling application of catastrophe theory is
the cusp catastrophe-agent-based model of teenage pregnancy, which illustrates
how latent factors—such as access to sex education, parental guidance, and peer
influence—interact with catastrophic shocks like socioeconomic deprivation
