bottom gate voltages ( 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡 and 𝑉𝑉𝑏𝑏) are applied. See device fabrication and 
characterization in the Supporting Information (SI), as well as Figure S1 and S2. As 
shown in Figure 1b, the heterostructure has an intrinsic type-I band alignment18,19, 
where the band gap of MoSe2 is fully encompassed within that of WS2. This is verified 
by the doping dependence of steady reflectance contrast (RC) spectrum (Figure 1d). 
Upon both electron and hole doping, the A-exciton resonance of MoSe2 (AM) is 
suppressed and the Fermi polarons20–24 (AM
− and AM
+ ) form, but little changes for the 
A-exciton resonance of WS2 (AW). The intrinsic conduction and valence band offsets 
(ΔC and ΔV) are respectively determined to be about 170 meV and 250 meV (Figure 
S3), consistent with previous studies18,19. Doping is modulated by 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷= 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡+ 1.15𝑉𝑉𝑏𝑏, 
where the coefficient of 1.15 mainly counts for different thicknesses of top and bottom 
hBN dielectrics; for a given 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷, the band offsets are modulated by 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸= 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡−1.15𝑉𝑉𝑏𝑏 
(see the SI for details). Unless otherwise specified, all optical measurements are 
performed at a sample temperature of 10 K. 
To explore the hot-electron extraction, we perform TR spectroscopy with the scheme 
illustrated in Figure 1b. Analogous to the principle of HCSCs (Figure 1c), MoSe2 works 
as a photoabsorber with tunable electron doping density 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒; WS2 works as a broadband 
ESC with tunable band offset ΔC. A pump pulse with photon energy about 1.746 eV is 
to generate hot excitons in MoSe2 without exciting WS2 (Figure 1e); a broadband pulse 
is to probe optical resonances of WS2 and thus monitor hot-electron transfer from
