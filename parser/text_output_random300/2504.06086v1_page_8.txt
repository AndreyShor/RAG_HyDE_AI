On the other hand, Marqu´e (2004) proposed that the radio depression corresponds to the entire MFR surrounding
the filament. Our study, however, shows that the radio depression only occupies the lower part of the MFR. In spite of
this, given the coherency of the radio depression and the fragmentation of the EUV and Hα filament, we suggest that
the radio depression can still serve to track the evolution of the MFR when studying the early dynamics of CMEs.

A. ENHANCEMENT OF THE RADIO DEPRESSION
In Section 3, the radio depression was found to be hardly discernible before and in the early phase of the eruption.
Then it quickly darkened, accompanied by its rise and expansion. To investigate the nature of this darkening, we
