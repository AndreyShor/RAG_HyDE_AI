that are sensitive to such noise. The channels in these detectors should have two features: continuous recordings
and a large number of samples per second (sps), such as 20, 40, 80, or 100. We have picked 362 points: Chile (7),
Argentina (17), Iceland (7), Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australian External Territories close to them (36), Nepal and
India (130), and the state of California in the USA (165). All of them are located near significant human clusters like
metropolis or big cities (Santiago, Reykjavik, Singapore, Kathmandu, Los Angeles). The list of stations is taken from
the IRIS website [61] and is available on the project GitHub repository [58] in the file “gmap-stations.txt”. We have
chosen two time-ranges of the data gathered from the stations. The first was from 1 January to 31 January 2015, and
the second was from 1 March to 22 April 2017. Both ranges have been divided into 24-hour periods. Once we have
the data, we eliminate the instrumental response by applying a 1–15 Hz filter to account for the environmental noise.
Then, we eliminate the linear tendency and resample the data to four samples per second to have homogeneity in the
data. All of this is possible thanks to the Python module Obspy [60]. After preprocessing 4.9 GB of raw data, we got
2050938429 bits of the seed.
Appendix B: Discretization
As we have already introduced in Section IV F, the seismic data are in the form of a sequence of floating point
numbers. To obtain the binary sequence, that is needed for our randomness test and also for any modern cryptographic
application, we are using various discretization methods. In the following, we define the five discretization methods
in detail.
Definition B.1 (discretizeEarthDataEvents1). Let d = (di)n
i=1 be a sequence of the input file values where n is the
number of these values. Then the discretized binary sequence s = (si)n
i=1 is defined as
si :=
(
0 : di ≥0
1 : di < 0
.
(B1)
Definition B.2 (discretizeEarthDataEvents2). Let d = (di)n
i=1 be a sequence of the input file values where n is the
number of these values. Then the discretized binary sequence s = (si)n
i=1 is defined as
si :=
(
0 : di ≥Ed
1 : di < Ed
(B2)
where
Ed :=
nP
i−1
di
n
(B3)
is the average value of the sequence d.
Definition B.3 (discretizeEarthDataEvents3). Let d = (di)n
i=1 be a sequence of the input file values where n is the
number of these values. Then the discretized binary sequence s = (si)n
i=1 is defined as
si :=
(
0 : |di| ≥E|d|
1 : |di| < E|d|
(B4)
where
E|d| :=
nP
i−1
|di|
n
(B5)
is the average value of the absolute values of the sequence d.
Definition B.4 (discretizeEarthDataEvents4). Let d = (di)n
i=1 be a sequence of the input file values where n is the
number of these values. Then the discretized binary sequence s = (si)n
i=1 is defined as
si :=
(
0 : di+1 ≥di
1 : di+1 < di
.
