Figure 4: Top row: Feynman diagrams contributing to the process eN →eNa. The dia-
grams correspond from left to right to the DB s-channel process, the DB u-channel process
and the Primakoff process. Bottom row: Corresponding Feynman diagrams contributing
to the process eγ →ea. Note that the lepton loop has been replaced with the effective
Primakoff coupling.

Dark Bremsstrahlung and Primakoff Production
The main ALP production mechanisms in beam-dump experiments are Dark Bremsstrahlung
(DB) and Primakoff production, shown in the top row of figure 4. In the DB diagrams, the
leptophilic ALP couples to the beam electron/muon at tree level, while for the Primakoff
process, it only couples to the photons via the effective loop coupling.
Due to the high energy of the beam compared to the ALP and lepton masses, the
photon that is exchanged between the nucleus and the electron/muon is approximately
on-shell [73].
As a result, the nucleus can be replaced by an effective flux of photons,
which is described by the Improved Weizs¨acker-Williams (IWW) approximation.
The
IWW approximation allows the cross section to be calculated using the reduced 2 →2
scattering amplitude |M|
2. Thus, for a lepton scattering with a nucleus
ℓ−(p) + N(Pi) →ℓ−(p′) + N(Pf) + a(k) ,
(3.7)
the simplified photoproduction processes are
ℓ−(p) + γ(q) →ℓ−(p′) + a(k) .
(3.8)
The simplified DB and Primakoff diagrams are shown in the bottom row of figure 4.
The differential cross section for the tree-level DB process can be calculated analytically
