uniformly for β ě 0, L ě Lh and probability mass functions φ satisfying (1.29), (1.30),
(1.32). The bound (1.33) still holds if, on the LHS, we replace Zβ
Lpφq with its restriction to
any subset of random walk paths in its definition (1.17).
We prove Theorem 1.11 in Section 5 in a strengthened form, see Theorem 5.2, where we
relax the assumption (1.30) and we consider partition functions Zβ
Lpφ, ψq averaged at both
endpoints (i.e. we allow for a “final condition” ψ, besides the initial condition φ).
Remark 1.12 (Beyond diffusive scales). We prove Theorem 1.11 under fairly general as-
sumptions: the bounded variance condition (1.32) is necessary, as we explain in Remark 1.14,
and the local uniformity assumption (1.30) is mild (and we further relax it in Section 5).
Only the exponential localisation condition on at most diffusive scale (1.29) imposes some
real restriction. For instance, for initial conditions φp¨q localised at scale
?
N, one can
consider system sizes L “ εN and prove a moment bound like (1.33) uniformly in ε ą 0, see
e.g. [CCR23, Proposition 2.3] in the quasi-critical regime, but this goes beyond the scope of
Theorem 1.11 because assumption (1.29) is not satisfied uniformly in ε ą 0.
We believe that our proof of Theorem 1.11 could be extended in order to relax the localisation
condition (1.29), but we refrain from doing so in the present paper.
Remark 1.13 (Hypercontractivity). The bound (1.33) shows that, under the assumptions
of Theorem 1.11, a form of hypercontractivity holds for the diffusively averaged partition
function: moments of order h ą 2 are controlled by the h
2-power of the second moment.
We point out that hypercontractivity is a general property of Wiener chaos and polynomial
chaos when the main contribution comes from chaos of bounded order [Jan97, MOO10]. This
is the case for the directed polymer partition function only in the sub-critical regime (1.26),
because in the quasi-critical and critical regimes (1.22) and (1.19) the main contribution
comes from chaos of unbounded order. The fact that the partition function still satisfies a
form of hypercontractivity in these latter regimes, by Therorem 1.11, is highly non-trivial.
Remark 1.14 (Intermittency). The bounded variance assumption (1.32) is crucial for
Theorem 1.11. In fact it is necessary for the moment bound (1.33) to hold as it is a general
fact that, for a sequence of nonnegative random variables Xn with mean 1 and diverging
variance, we have

since h ą 2 and the second moment ErX2

In the case XN “ ZβN
LN pφNq with the support of φN shrinking to 0 fast enough such that
the variance diverges as N Ñ 8, we actually expect a stronger intermittency of the form

Such results have been proved in the continuum setting of the Critical 2D SHF [CSZ23b, LZ24].
1.5. Extensions and related results. Theorem 1.2, which deals with the regime
ϑ Ñ ´8, is proved by approximating the SHF by the directed polymer partition functions
