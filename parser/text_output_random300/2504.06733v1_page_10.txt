the centre of the (empty) C60 cage in the metastable 6:6-bond-down, on-top adsorp-
tion geometry. Our monolayer preparation method very much favours adsorption in
this kinetically limited state. As such, the experimentally measured 5.54 ± 0.04 ˚A
Ar-Ag(111) separation places the argon atom at the centre of the adsorbed endo-
fullerene, its intracage position unperturbed by the chemisorption of the surrounding
molecule.
For the metal-adsorbed Ar@C60 monolayer, all trace of the spectator channel is
removed and only the traditional Auger de-excitation pathway remains (Fig. 5(a)).
The complete absence of spectator signal above the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limit
of our experimental measurement means that the electron delocalization time is now
at the sub-femtosecond level. Taking the magnitude of the measurement SNR into
account[26], we can place an upper limit on the value of τD. We first determine the
standard deviation, σ, of the background noise in the binding energy region (25 –
27 eV) where we would expect spectator intensity to be located if it were present.
Our criterion for signal detection is that the peak intensity should be a minimum
of 3σ above the background. On this basis, we find that the minimium detectable
spectator signal would be a factor of 0.08 smaller than the normal Auger-Meitner
intensity. (We note that this is very close to the factor of 0.1 estimated by F¨ohlisch et

Fig. 5 Escape in less than a femtosecond: charge transfer for a chemisorbed Ar@C60
monolayer. (a) On-resonance deexcitation spectrum (in blue) for Ar@C60/Ag(111) following a lin-
ear background subtraction and a shift to 1.25 eV higher binding energy so as to align with the
corresponding spectrum for the multilayer sample (purple). There is a complete absence of spectator
peaks for the Ar@C60/Ag(111) sample, and thus a sub-femtosecond Ar 4s delocalization time. We
estimate an upper limit of 500 attoseconds (see text). Inset: Valence band spectrum (ℏω = 110 eV)
for the ∼1 ML Ar@C60/Ag(111) sample. The HOMO and HOMO+1 binding energies exactly match
those for 1 ML of empty C60 on Ag(111)[46, 47]; (b) Ground state DFT calculation showing the dif-
ference in charge distribution for Ar@C60 adsorbed on Ag(111), as compared to the isolated molecule
and metal. The vast majority of the charge difference is restricted to the fullerene cage-Ag(111) inter-
face; the ground state electron density of the Ar atom is almost entirely unaffected by adsorption.
