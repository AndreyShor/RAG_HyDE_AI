Scattering Protons
The price to pay is that one need to introduce a new set of renormalized quantities which now
depend on one additional scale and coincide with the physical parameter for a precise boundary
condition.
This procedure entails two custom choices: first, the inclusion of finite terms in either the bare
or renormalized quantity is not constrained. Here, as common in literature we will adopt the
MS scheme, where in addition to the divergent pieces, only the term γE −ln(4π) 1 are kept in
the bare parameters. Let us stress that, in order to obtain consistent results, all the different
quantities needs to be defined with the same subtraction scheme. The second choice regards
the definition of the renormalization scale µR, at which the parameter redefinition is performed
with respect to the physical scale Q at which the degree of freedom is probed. Noticing
that the renormalized quantity depends only on the ratio Q/µR and, imposing the scaling
invariance of the renormalized quantity upon the choice of µR it leads to a renormalization
group equation (RGE), which fixes the running of the parameter. Focusing on the strong

where the beta function is now known up to five-loop O(a5
s) [34, 35]. In the r.h.s we explicitly
factor out the global minus sign with the leading coefficient positive definite β0 > 0 and
nf = 3, . . . , 6. In the following, for all the pQCD expansions, we assume the boundary condition
to be as(µ0 = MZ = 91.18 GeV) = 0.118/(4π). The leading-order solution 2 of Eq. (1.6) is given

The actual values of the QCD βi coefficients (and in particular of β0) depend not only on the
number of colors NC = 3, but also on the number of active flavors nf running in the loops,
which can be at most 6.
All these observations, which seem quite simple at first sight, have a huge phenomenological
consequence which distinguishes the behavior of the QED and QCD interactions. First, a
negative beta function implies that the strong coupling becomes smaller at high scales and
colored particles are then asymptotically free as observed for instance in DIS (see Section 1.2.2).
On the other hand, at low energies the strong coupling can blow up, and it becomes large. From
the leading order solution (Eq. (1.7)) one can read out the scale at which this happens, finding
ΛQCD = MZ exp(−1/(2as(Mz)β0)) ≈10 MeV, although a more reasonable value, including
higher order corrections, is of the order 300 MeV [27]. This can explain why the strong
