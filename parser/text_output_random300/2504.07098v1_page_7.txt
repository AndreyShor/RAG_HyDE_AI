where µ−
L = Re(α−
L) = −ML. It is clear that this case is equivalent to the previous one up to the transformation x →−x, (i.e.,
y →1 −y), which corresponds also to substituting s →−s, αL ↔αR, vL ↔vR, and mL ↔mR. This gives also v1 →−v1
and m2 →m2 in Eq. (B1) which yields a, b →a, b and 1 −c →c −a −b.
For the limiting case sgn(ML) = −1, sgn(MR) = 0, and Re(vL)Re(vR) < 0, the solution in Eq. (19) still satisfy the boundary
conditions, by taking mR = 0 into the solution, giving K+
R > 0 if s = sgn(Re(vR)), which is indeed the case since we choose
s = −sgn(Re(vL)) and Re(vL)Re(vR) < 0.
The asymptotic behavior is determined on the left by the exponents α−
L = −svL −qL (characteristic lengths ξ−
L , λ−
L) and on
the right by α+
R = svR + qR (characteristic lengths ξ+
R, λ+
R).

No zero modes otherwise
In any other case, no nontrivial linear combination of the general solutions can satisfy the boundary conditions.
For sgn(ML) ≥0 and sgn(MR) ≥0, the topological invariants are zero WL,R = 0, and one has Re(α+
L) ≥0 ≥Re(α−
L) and
Re(α+
R) ≥0 ≥Re(α−
R). The solution φs
1(x) decays to zero only for x →−∞, while the solution φs
2(y) decays to zero only for
x →∞. Therefore, one cannot find any nontrivial linear combination that satisfies the boundary conditions.
For sgn(ML) = −1, sgn(MR) = −1, and Re(vL)Re(vR) > 0, the topological invariants are equal and nonzero WL =
WR = ±1, and one has sgn(Re(α±
L)) = −s sgn(Re(vL)) and sgn(Re(α±
R)) = s sgn(Re(vR)), which gives sgn(Re(α±
L)) =
−sgn(Re(α±
R)) in this case. Choosing the pseudospin such that Re(α±
R) > 0, one has that φs
1,2(x) diverge for x →−∞with
different decaying lengths, so that no nontrivial linear combination can satisfy the boundary conditions. Conversely, choosing the
pseudospin such that Re(α±
L) > 0 one has that φs
1,2(x) diverge for x →∞with different decaying lengths, so that no nontrivial
linear combination can satisfy the boundary conditions. Hence, the boundary conditions cannot be satisfied.
In the case where sgn(ML) = 0, sgn(MR) ≤0, and Re(vL)Re(vR) ≥0, the case sgn(ML) ≤0, sgn(MR) = 0, and
Re(vL)Re(vR) ≥0, and the case sgn(ML) ≤0, sgn(MR) ≤0, and Re(vL)Re(vR) = 0, at least one of the four exponents
α±
L,R vanishes so that the corresponding asymptote converges to a constant value. Therefore, φs
1,2(x) diverge for x →±∞
with different decaying lengths or converge to a constant, and again no nontrivial linear combination can satisfy the boundary
conditions. Hence, the boundary conditions cannot be satisfied for mL ≤0, mR ≤0, and Re(vL)Re(vR) ≥0.
Moreover, in the case where sgn(ML) = 1, sgn(MR) = −1, and Re(vR)Re(vL) = 0, the solution Eq. (16) does not decay
to zero for either x →±∞. Finally, in the case where sgn(ML) = −1, sgn(MR) = 1, and Re(vR)Re(vL) = 0, the solution
Eq. (19) does not decay to zero for either x →±∞, and also in these cases, the boundary conditions cannot be satisfied.
C.
Semi-infinite interval 0 ≤x < ∞
Zero modes on the interval 0 ≤x < ∞satisfying the boundary conditions φ(0) = φ(∞) = 0 are given by linear combinations
of φs
1,2(x) in Eq. (7) with Re(α±
R) > 0. As expected, there is one independent mode if WR ̸= 1. To demonstrate this
statement, we need to find the particular solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions φ(x →0) = φ(x →∞) = 0, i.e.,
φ(y →1/2) = φ(y →1) = 0.
Assuming |F1,2(y)| convergent or logarithmically divergent at y = 1/2, 1, we only need to care now about the factor (1−y)wα−
R,
which converge to zero at y = 1 only if Re(α−
R) > 0. This gives only two possible outcomes, discussed below and summarized in
Table II. Zero modes on the interval −∞< x ≤0 can be obtained similarly. Note that the confinement to semi-infinite intervals
introduces a sharp domain wall at x = 0, being effectively equivalent to an infinite potential wall and which is superimposed to a
smooth domain wall with a finite width when w > 0.

One zero mode for WR = ±1
For sgn(MR) = −1 and Re(vR) ̸= 0, the topological invariant is nonzero WR = sgn(Re(vR)) ̸= 0, giving sgn(Re(α±
R)) =
s sgn(Re(vR)). Choosing s = −sgn(Re(vR)) gives Re(α±
R) < 0, and therefore the two linearly independent solutions φs
1,2(x)
in Eq. (A11) diverge for x →∞with different decaying lengths, and thus their linear combination cannot satisfy the boundary
conditions. Choosing instead s = sgn(Re(vR)) gives Re(α±
R) > 0, and with both solutions φs
1,2(x) decaying to zero for x →∞.
Therefore, the particular solution satisfying the boundary conditions is the linear combination
φ(x) = A1φs
1(x) + A2φs
2(x),
(22)
with pseudospin s = sgn(Re(vR)) in Eq. (2), φs
1,2(x) as in Eqs. (A11) and (B12), αL, αR given by Eq. (A6), and with A1,2
chosen such that φ(0) = A1φs
1(0) + A2φs
2(0) = 0. Since Re(α−
R) ≤Re(α+
R), the asymptotic behavior at large distances is given
