We will now show that (128) holds by using (129) repeatedly. Let us begin by plugging (123)
into (128) to rewrite it in terms of the perturbative C’s as14
(α2 −β2)
h
Cα,β + ˆCα,−κsC−κs,β
i
=

˙Cα + ˆCα ˆC−κrC−κr + ˆCα,−κr ˙C−κr

ˆCβ −

˙Cβ + ˆCβ ˆC−κrC−κr + ˆCβ,−κr ˙C−κr

ˆCα

ˆCβ −

˙Cβ + ˆCβ,−κr ˙C−κr

ˆCα .
(130)
We can now use the perturbative part of the second equation (129) to drop Cα,β and obtain
(α2 −β2) ˆCα,−κsC−κs,β =

˙Cα ˆCβ,−κtC−κt + ˆCα,−κr ˙C−κr(Cβ + ˆCβ,−κtC−κt)

−

˙Cβ ˆCα,−κtC−κt + ˆCβ,−κr ˙C−κr(Cα + ˆCα,−κtC−κt)

.
(131)
Using (129) again, we subtract (κ2
s −β2)C−κs,β = ˙C−κsCβ −˙CβC−κs to get
(α2 −κ2
s) ˆCα,−κsC−κs,β =

˙Cα ˆCβ,−κtC−κt + ˆCα,−κr ˙C−κr(
ˆCβ,−κtC−κt)

−

ˆCβ,−κr ˙C−κr(Cα + ˆCα,−κtC−κt)

.
(132)
Similarly, we can rewrite ˆCα,−κs = Cα,−κt(C)−κt,−κs and subtract the identity (129) for (α2 −
κ2
t )Cα,−κt, resulting in
(κ2
t −κ2
s)Cα,−κt(C)−κt,−κsC−κs,β = ˆCα,−κt ˆCβ,−κr
h
˙C−κtC−κr −˙C−κrC−κt

.
(133)
Finally, using (129) once more with ˙C−κtC−κr −˙C−κrC−κt = (κ2
r −κ2
t )Cκr,κt leads to
(κ2
t −κ2
s)Cα,−κt(C)−κt,−κsC−κs,β = (κ2
t −κ2
s) ˆCα,−κtCκt,κs ˆCβ,−κs ,
(134)
which is true and can be seen directly by plugging in the definitions of ˆCα,−κℓand C−κt,−κs and
using (126).
A.3
The second equation
Here we consider the differential equation (34). The trans-series from (57) can be written in
terms of ˆC as
χα = 1
2G+(iα) ˆCα + 1
2G−(iα) ˆC−α .
(135)
Further, we rewrite the function F as
F = f + ˆf ,
(136)
where f is the perturbative part and ˆf is the non-perturbative part.
We now turn to the third differential equation (34), which can be written in terms of the
ˆC’s as
( ¨ˆCα + σ+
α ¨ˆC−α) −α2( ˆCα + σ+
α ˆC−α) = (f + ˆf)( ˆCα + σ+
α ˆC−α) .
(137)
The expression above once again must hold for each combination of prefactors σ+
α and hence it
will be sufficient to consider the equation
¨Cα + d2
db2 (Cα,−κr(C)−κr,−κsC−κs) −α2(Cα + Cα,−κr(C)−κr,−κsC−κs)
= (f + ˆf)[Cα + Cα,−κr(C)−κr,−κsC−κs] ,
(138)
14For sake of readability, we leave the sums here implicit and also drop factors of S−κℓ. Whenever there are
two C’s with the same index −κℓa summation P∞
ℓ=1 S−κℓincluding the factor S−κℓshould be inserted.
