that the substantial uncertainties on KBe should not hinder further
analysis.
We cross-checked our shift-and-add disentangling results
with the method of Seeburger et al. (2024), which does not re-
quire orbital parameters as input. This technique provided disen-
tangled component spectra, RVs for the narrow-lined B star, and
an inferred mass ratio. The donor star’s RVs are consistent with
those derived via cross-correlation, within 1–2σ. The inferred
mass ratio, q ≈0.061, implies a semi-amplitude for the Be star
of KBe ≈5 km/s, though both q and KBe have significant uncer-
tainties. Overall, these results align with those obtained from the
shift-and-add technique.
The full wavelength range of the observed, disentangled and
modelled spectra is shown in Fig. B.3. The S/N of the disen-
tangled spectra, based on the pixel-to-pixel scatter at 4500 Å, is
approximately 370 for the stripped star and 280 for the Be star.
However, this estimate does not account for systematic uncer-
tainties introduced by the disentangling process, which dominate
the overall uncertainty. By estimating the systematic uncertain-
ties as the standard deviation of the flux residuals between the
observed and disentangled spectra, we find these to be roughly
1.4 times larger than the statistical pixel-based noise.
Appendix C: Stellar atmosphere models
For the stripped star, we computed new model atmospheres
with the non-LTE Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code (Gräfener
et al. 2002; Hamann & Gräfener 2003; Sander et al. 2015).
The models were computed, with negligible mass-loss rates;
˙M = 10−9 M⊙/yr, microturbulent velocity of 10 km/s, and a fixed
terminal wind velocity 1000 km/s. From these models, synthetic
spectra were generated for stars of effective temperatures 10,
12.5, 13, 14, and 15 kK and with surface gravity log g in the
range 2.0 to 3.0 with step sizes of 0.25 dex. Two sets of abun-
dances were considered: one with solar composition following
Asplund et al. (2021), and one representative of a stripped star,
with nitrogen enrichment and carbon and oxygen depletion. The
adopted mass fractions are listed in Table C.1. To explore the
effects of hydrogen depletion, we computed an additional series
of models with fixed Teff = 13.5 kK and log g = 2.25, but with
varying hydrogen mass fractions from X = 0.001 to 0.7 in steps
of 0.1, keeping the CNO-processed abundances fixed.
Appendix D: Helium enrichment
Initial comparisons between the disentangled spectrum of the
stripped star and solar-composition models revealed that helium
lines were systematically under-predicted (Fig. 7). This discrep-
ancy points to helium enrichment, as expected for a stripped
star that has lost much of its hydrogen envelope. To quantify
the effect, we computed additional PoWR models with fixed
Teff = 13.5 kK and log g = 2.25, varying only the hydrogen
(and hence helium) content while keeping the CNO-processed
abundances fixed. As shown in Fig. D.1, increasing helium en-
hances the strength of the He I lines. The model with X = 0.3
best reproduces the observed helium line equivalent widths and
was adopted as our fiducial model. This value is consistent with
predictions from the MESA evolutionary tracks (Sect. 8), which
suggest X ∼0.25 for the stripped star. Notably, the Balmer line
profiles remain largely unaffected for hydrogen mass fractions
down to X ∼0.1, supporting the robustness of our flux ratio and
surface gravity estimates derived from these lines. We note, how-
ever, that helium enrichment can impact metal line strengths. In

Notes. The solar abundances follow Asplund et al. (2021), the stripped
star models are enriched in N and deficient in O and C compared to a
solar composition. H and He are varied in the stripped-star grid, with
He determined by Y = 1 −X −Z, we list the adopted best-fit values.
particular, Si II 4128, 4131 Å lines are somewhat over-predicted
in the X = 0.3 model. A model with a slightly higher hydro-
gen content or a lower flux contribution would provide a better
match. However, given the additional uncertainties related to mi-
croturbulence and metallicity, we adopt X = 0.3 as the best com-
promise and defer a detailed abundance analysis to future work.
Finally, we note that other bloated stripped stars, such as LB-1
(X ∼0.55, Shenar et al. 2020) and HR 6819 (solar composi-
tion per Bodensteiner et al. 2020a or X ∼0.55 from El-Badry &
Quataert 2020), do not show strong evidence for significant hy-
drogen depletion. This suggests that helium enrichment alone is
not a definitive indicator of a stripped star, possibly due to mea-
surement challenges or because these stars retain a substantial
hydrogen fraction.
Appendix E: Rotation
We determined the rotational velocities of the binary compo-
nents by fitting rotationally broadened models to individual ab-
sorption lines in the disentangled spectra. For the narrow-lined
stripped star, we used metal absorption lines while for the Be
star companion we had to resort to He I lines for lack of strong
enough metal lines. The model spectra were convolved with a
Gaussian kernel to account for instrumental broadening (using
the resolution of the telescope with the lowest resolving power),
a rotational kernel with varying values of vrot sin i, and a radial-
tangential kernel with the standard limb-darkening coefficient
ϵ = 0.6 (Gray 2005; Aerts et al. 2014) and varying the macro-
turbulent velocity vmac. We adapted the Fortran code rotin3 to
Python for numerical implementation. For each spectral line, the
best-fit parameters and their variances were determined using a
least-squares approach implemented with the curve_fit func-
tion from the scipy.optimize Python package. The reported
values and errors for the rotation measurement are derived as the
weighted mean and standard deviation of the weighted mean,
calculated from the inverse-variance weighted results of all anal-
ysed spectral lines.

disentangled spectrum of the stripped star. Overplotted are the
best-fit PoWR model spectra (Teff = 13.5 kK, log g = 2.25) with

broadening, only macroturbulent broadening, and a combined
