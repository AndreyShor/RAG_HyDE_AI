to parton showers and including the complete set of SMEFT operators, were implemented in
the POWHEG in Ref. [603]. The inclusive cross section to N3LOQCD accuracy are now publicly
available through the program n3loxs [473].
Published results for the V H cross section are available for data samples up to 139 fb−1,
with uncertainties on the order of 20%, equally divided between statistical and systematic er-
rors [604]. For 3000 fb−1, the statistical error will reduce to 4–5%, resulting in a measurement
that is systematically limited, unless there are significant improvements to the systematic errors.
The general V H process has been calculated to NNLOQCD, leading to a small scale uncertainty.
However, for the best description of the ZH process, the exact NLO corrections to the gg →ZH
sub-process, described above, should be included.

V H + j
LH21 status:
Known at NLOQCD + PS [605] and NLOSM + PS [585].
Fully differential
NNLOQCD corrections known [145,146].
3.1.8
HH
LH21 status: N3LOHTL corrections are known in the infinite top mass limit [606,607] and have
been reweighted by the NLOQCD result [608]. Finite mt effects are incorporated in NNLOHTL cal-
culation by reweighting and combined with full-mt double-real corrections in Ref. [211]. NLOQCD
results including the full top-quark mass dependence are known numerically [609–612] and
matched to parton showers [613,614]; exact numerical results have also been supplemented by re-
sults obtained in a small-mt expansion [615,616]; a Padé approximated result based on the large-
mt expansion and analytic results near the top threshold was presented in Ref. [486]. The top
quark mass renormalisation scheme uncertainty is known at NLOQCD [611,612,617]. Threshold
resummation was performed at NLOHTL + NNLL [618] and NNLOHTL + NNLL [619]. NLOHTL
+ NLL resummation for the pT of the Higgs boson pair was presented in [620]. NNLOQCD virtual
and real-virtual corrections (involving three closed top-quark loops) known in a large-mt expan-
sion [621,622]. Sensitivity of HH production to the quartic self-coupling (which enters via EW
corrections) was studied in Refs. [623–625]. The b¯b →HH process is known at NNLOQCD [626],
two-loop amplitudes for the quark annihilation contributions are known at NNLOHTL [627].
Results in the HEFT and SMEFT are known at NLOQCD [628,629] and NNLOHTL [630].
Results at N3LOHTL matched to soft-gluon threshold resummation at N3LL and reweighted
by the NLOQCD result have been presented in Ref. [631]. The central prediction is found to
be compatible with the known N3LOHTL results within the percent-level remaining scale uncer-
tainties. By combining the small-pT [632] and high-energy [616] expansions, the NLOQCD result
has been matched to parton shower in the POWHEG-box framework including the dependence
on the top quark mass, allowing the renormalisation scheme to be varied [633]. In Ref. [634] the
NNLOHTL result is matched to parton shower using the GENEVA framework, and zero-jettiness
logarithms are resummed to N3LL . Ref. [635] presents compact analytic results for pp →HHj at
LOQCD (1-loop). These results have been used to produce an improved MCFM implementation
of HH production at NLOQCD.
In Ref. [636], the pp →bbH channel, a background to pp →H(→bb)H, has been studied
at NLOQCD matched to parton shower including the y2
b and y2
t (at NLOHTL) contributions.
This work approximately halves the remaining theoretical scale/shower uncertainties originating
from the O(y2
t ) contributions to this background process. The 5FS NNLOQCD +PS calculation
is found to overestimate the background by a factor of 2.
Ref. [637] presents pp →H(→
bb)H(→γγ), treating both production and decay subprocesses at NLOQCD in the narrow-width
