FIG. 1.
The real (a) and imaginary (b) parts of the dis-
persion E(q) = ℏω(q) for different condensate densities ρ0.
The condensate is resting in the laboratory reference system
(the phase gradient of ψ is equal to zero).
The real part
of dispersion shows linear scaling with q at small momenta,
characteristic of superfluid behavior. The critical superfluid
velocity increases with the density, as expected. The imag-
inary part of dispersion is responsible for the decay of the
excitations provided by the pure energy relaxation term and
scales quadratically with q.
Parameters of the system are
g = 6 · 10−3 meV · µm2, m = 5 · 10−5m0, ρ0 = 100 µm−2,
λ = 0.5 · 10−4µm4 · ps−1.
with q is proportional to Im[ω(q)] ∼q2.
In the case
of the subsonic regime, no emitted waves have been ob-
served, and this regime is very similar to that known for
unperturbed GPE (see panels (e) and (f)).
Stability of superfluid and non-superfluid flows.
All stationary solutions of GPE are also solutions of
(14). This follows from the fact that for that solution
∇j = 0 and the term accounting for the relaxation van-
ishes.
However, relaxation does affect the stability of
solutions. To analyze this, one should use Eq. 14 the
ansatz corresponding to a spatially uniform condensate
propagates along the x axis with the wavevector of the
absolute value κ,
ψ(r, t) = e−i( gρ0

and then perform the linearization procedure. This gives
the following dispersion relation for the excitations:

Note that for κ = 0 Eqs.17 and 19 are equivalent. How-
ever, differently from Eq.17 the imaginary part of Eq.19
can become positive, resulting in the development of the
flow instability. The typical dependence of the instability
increment (positive imaginary part of (17)) for an unsta-
ble condensate is shown in Fig. 3(a) as a function of qx,
qy.
The dependency of the maximum instability increment
as a function of ρ0 and κ is shown in Fig. 3(b). As ex-
pected, it is higher for fast-moving condensates. How-
ever, the dependency on the condensate density ρ0 at
fixed κ is not monotonous: it is always zero for ρ0 = 0,
then grows, reaches its maximum, and then at some den-
sity is rolled to zero so that the condensate stabilizes. It
happens exactly at the point where the velocity of the
condensate becomes equal to the critical velocity defined
by the Landau criterion. More details on the develop-
ment of the instability are given in Supp. Mat.
Deceleration of polariton droplets. Let us now analyze
how energy relaxation affects the dynamics of polariton
droplets. To keep the presentation short, we consider the
simplest case of one-dimensional Gaussian wavepacket
ψ(t = 0, x) = √ρm exp(−x2/w2
0 + ik0x) with the maxi-
mum density ρm and wavevector k0.
We have performed a series of numerical simulations
that reveal that the non-zero relaxation energy rate λ ̸= 0
results in the deceleration of the condensate pulse. The
dependencies of the velocities of the condensates are de-
fined as v = d⟨x⟩/dt with ⟨x⟩= N −1 R
x|ψ|2dx, N =
R
|ψ|2dx are shown in Fig. 4 for different initial peak
densities and velocities.
As expected, the deceleration rate increases with the
condensate densities; see Supp. Mat. We have checked
that at short propagation times the velocity decreased
exponentially, v = v0exp(−γt) with the decay rate γ be-
ing independent on k0 and scaling linearly with ρm. At
longer propagation distances the pulse broadens, its in-
tensity decreases, and the velocity scaling with time be-
