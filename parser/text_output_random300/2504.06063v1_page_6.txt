By relying on the interpretation of the integration limits
given in Eq. (21), one has
Z ωmax

F G −ϵ

(23)
which means that the exclusive contribution has been
fully included. Notice that the shift of the limit |ω|max
¯
F G
is also necessary because at the end-point corner of the
phase-space where |ω| = |ω|max
¯
F G one has ωmax = ωmin
¯
F G .
As far as the parameter ϵ is concerned, from the the-
oretical perspective it has to be read as 0+, i.e. an in-
finitesimal shift that sets the prescription to calculate
the integrals of the distributions dΓ/dω2dω0. From the
phenomenological perspective ϵ can be identified with the
energy-momentum resolution of the experimental appa-
ratus.
We now provide the explicit expression of dΓexcl

In each flavor channel, the hadronic tensor Hµν

In the previous expression we called ¯Hµν

fg (p, ω) the con-
tribution coming from the continuum spectrum and we
have ¯Hµν

fg (p, ω) = 0 for ω0 < ωmin

is the energy gap in the given flavor channel. Then we
have introduced Ω¯

THE TOTAL DECAY RATE
In order to compute the total rate Γ, the integrals appear-
ing in Eq. (16) have to be performed. Given Eq. (17),
and by using the fact that the hadronic form factors
h(i)(ω0, ω2) do not depend upon eℓ, the lepton energy
integral can be performed analytically and one finds

dω0dω2 =

and where we have introduced the following three linear
combinations of the five independent hadronic spectral
densities Y(i)(ω0, ω2),
Z(0) = Y(2) + Y(3) −2Y(4) ,
Z(1) = 2

Y(3) −2Y(1) −Y(4)
,
Z(2) = Y(3) −2Y(1) .
(30)
From the previous expressions it is evident that the
parity-breaking form factor h(5) = Y(5)/|ω| does not con-
tribute to the total rate.
To compute the ω0 integral in Eq. (16) we first need to
derive a mathematical representation of the decay rate
that is suitable for a lattice evaluation. To this end, we
start by introducing the kernels
Θ(p)
σ (x) = xp Θσ(x) ,
(31)
where p = 0, 1, 2, · · · , is a non-negative integer and Θσ(x)
is any Schwartz4 representation of the Heaviside step-
function θ(x), which depends smoothly upon the smear-
ing parameter σ and which is such that
lim
σ7→0 Θσ(x) = θ(x) .
(32)
In this work we considered two different representations
Θσ(x) which are explicitly given in Eqs. (76) and (77).
The introduction of this mathematical device allows to
trade the ω0 phase-space integral, to be performed in the
4 That is, infinitely differentiable and vanishing, together with all
of its derivatives, faster than any power of x in the limit x 7→−∞.
