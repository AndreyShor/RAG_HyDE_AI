of ∼1.5 T. Overall behaviors depicted in Figs. 9(a) and (b) suggest that the 550 ◦C
annealed sample exhibits the best Jc performance. The ﬂux pinning force densities,
Fp, at 4.2 K are compared among samples subjected to diﬀerent annealing conditions.
The highest Fp value of 3 GN/m3 is achieved in the sample annealed at 550 ◦C. A
systematic shift in the magnetic ﬁeld corresponding to the maximum Fp is observed,
ranging from approximately 2.5 T in the 450 ◦C annealed sample to 0.1 T in the 800
◦C annealed sample. This shift suggests a possible crossover in the pinning mechanism
with increasing annealing temperature. Fig. 9(c) presents an analysis of data from
various samples using three pinning models. While the pinning mechanism strongly
depends on the annealing temperature, the fp behavior of the 550 ◦C annealed sample
aligns with the normal point pinning model. Considering the pronounced lattice strain
observed in the 550 ◦C annealed sample, it is inferred that this strain acts as a point-
pinning center, eﬀectively impeding ﬂux motion under an applied magnetic ﬁeld.

of
Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 wires[75]. This study holds signiﬁcant value in assessing
the feasibility of HEA-based superconducting wires. Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 wires
were produced using the ex-situ powder-in-tube (PIT) method. The precursor powder,
comprising a stoichiometric mixture of elemental powders, was prepared via high-
energy planetary ball milling. The prepared precursor was loaded into Fe metal tubes,
which were then drawn into wires. The wires, cut into 30 mm lengths, were sintered
in an evacuated quartz tube for 1 hour at various sintering temperatures (Ts=600 ∼
1000 ◦C).
In Fig. 10, Tc is plotted as a function of Ts. Tc increases markedly from 5.10 K in the
untreated wire (bare state) to 7.76 K in the wire sintered at 700 ◦C. However, further
increases in Ts lead to a gradual decrease in Tc. The authors attribute the enhanced Tc
at Ts between 500 and 700 ◦C to the formation of a Ta/Nb-rich bcc phase. Conversely,
the decline in Tc above 700 ◦C is speculated to result from the emergence of impurity
phases, such as Hf2Fe and Zr2Fe, with the Fe contamination arising from the Fe tube
used in the PIT process. Unlike the Tc trends, µ0Hc2(0) for wires sintered between
600 and 900 ◦C exhibits minimal variation, maintaining a high value of 10.3 T, corre-
sponding to a coherence length of 5.66 nm. This stability of µ0Hc2(0) across diﬀerent
annealing conditions is advantageous for practical superconducting wire applications.
Figures 11(a) and (b) present the magnetic ﬁeld-dependent Jc for each wire. The
low-ﬁeld Jc at 4.2 K for the wire sintered at 700 ◦C exceeds 100 kA/cm2, meeting the
threshold for practical applications. However, further enhancement of Jc under higher
magnetic ﬁelds remains desirable. Similar to heat-treated Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6,
a systematic decrease in the magnetic ﬁeld corresponding to the maximum ﬂux pin-
ning force density is observed with increasing sintering temperature from 600 ◦C to
1000 ◦C. The sample sintered at 700 ◦C exhibits the highest pinning force density
of 1.1 GN/m3. The analysis of the pinning mechanism, shown in Fig. 11(c), indi-
cates that most wires are dominated by normal point pinning. This ﬁnding aligns
with observations in thermally annealed Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 bulk samples[74].
Hence, lattice strain likely plays a pivotal role in magnetic ﬂux pinning. Additionally,
