increasingly pronounced with decreasing temperature. This behavior, known as mag-
netic ﬂux jumps, is characteristic of a superconductor with strong ﬂux pinning and
arises from magnetic instability due to disturbances associated with ﬂux motion[72].
It is noteworthy that magnetic ﬂux jumps are absent in the arc-melted sample, which
lacks impurity phases. This contrast suggests that microstructural diﬀerences between
the arc-melted and SPS samples play a crucial role in determining pinning strength.
The Jc data extracted from magnetic measurements are displayed in Fig. 5(a). The
Jc values of the SPS sample are approximately 30,500 A/cm2 (at 2 K and 0.01 T)
and 73,200 A/cm2 (at 4 K and 0.01 T). These values represent signiﬁcant increases of
approximately 286 % (at 2 K and 0.01 T) and 687 % (at 4 K and 0.01 T) compared to
the 10,655 A/cm2 (at 2 K and 0.01 T) of the arc-melted sample in the as-cast state.
The authors attribute this enhancement in Jc to magnetic ﬂux pinning induced by
impurities. The pinning force density, Fp, of the SPS sample systematically increases
as the temperature decreases within the measured magnetic ﬁeld range. The maximum
Fp reaches approximately 0.4 GN/m3 at 2 K, two orders of magnitude higher than
that of the arc-melted sample. The pinning mechanism was further analyzed by exam-
ining fp(h), as shown in Fig. 5(b). The experimental results, including those of the
arc-melted sample, were compared with the surface pinning model (black line) and the
point pinning model (red line). While the surface pinning model adequately describes
fp(h) for the arc-melted sample, the fp(h) of the SPS sample likely reﬂects contribu-
tions from both surface and point pinning mechanisms. The observed enhancement of
Jc in the SPS sample compared to the arc-melted sample is particularly noteworthy,
as the preparation method profoundly impacts the Jc performance. In this case, the
impurity phases introduced by contamination during the ball milling process appear
to be eﬀective magnetic ﬂux pinning sites.
SPS samples exhibit relatively high Jc, primarily due to the introduction of inter-
metallic impurities. The source of contamination is the ball milling process prior to
SPS treatment, during which Fe contamination from the stainless-steel balls and jar
occurs. Enhancing Jc by combining SPS and ball milling methods may be applicable
to other HEAs, provided that the elements used in the balls and jar and the HEA
components can form intermetallic compounds. An alternative approach for intro-
ducing intermetallic impurities is the deliberate addition of small amounts of foreign
elements during the melting process, which necessitates a thorough understanding of
alloy phase formation.
3.3 Thin ﬁlm sample
The remarkable improvement in Jc of thin-ﬁlm Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 represents
a milestone in the research of HEA superconductors, as reported in Nature Commu-
nications in 2022[49]. This study highlights the thin-ﬁlm Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6,
which exhibits a Jc signiﬁcantly exceeding the benchmark performance of Nb-Ti wires
used in high-ﬁeld superconducting magnets. The target Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6
material was synthesized using a ball-milling and hot-press sintering process. High-
quality thin ﬁlms were subsequently fabricated on c-cut Al2O3 substrates using a
pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique, with the substrate temperature (Ts) varied
between 270 ◦C and 620 ◦C. The thickness of the resulting ﬁlms ranged from 115
