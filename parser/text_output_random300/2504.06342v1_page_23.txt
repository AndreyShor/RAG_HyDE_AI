be extended to include more physical processes,
such as magnetic fields and cosmic rays (see ยง4.4).
The axisymmetric nature of MACER2D simula-
tions limits their comprehensive applicability to
certain types of galaxies, such as disk galaxies,
where three-dimensional effects, e.g., gravitational
torques and non-axisymmetric instabilities, are in-
dispensable for the angular momentum transport of
the gas in the galaxy.
Although the discussion above is dedicated to the
comparison between MACER3D and MACER2D
simulations, it reflects more general differences be-
tween 3D and 2D models, and between single-
channel and multi-channel feedback implemen-
tations.
The comparison suggests that three-
dimensional modeling with comprehensive feed-
back physics is essential for accurately capturing
galaxy evolution, even in relatively simple systems
like isolated elliptical galaxies. While AGN feed-
back has long been recognized as crucial for main-
taining quiescence in massive ellipticals, the com-
parison demonstrates that accurately modeling SN
feedback is equally important, even in ellipticals.
4.3. Caveats
We acknowledge several important caveats and
limitations of the current study:
(i) Limited CGM resolution While our simula-
tions achieve high resolution near the Bondi
radius, which proves essential for accurately
modeling gas accretion and feedback dynam-
ics, the logarithmically decreasing resolution
toward outer regions may inadequately cap-
ture thermal instabilities and turbulence in
the CGM (McCourt et al. 2017; Peeples et al.
2018; Hummels et al. 2018). The observed
cool (โผ104 K) gas component in the CGM of
elliptical galaxies (e.g., Zahedy et al. 2019)
is significantly underrepresented in our sim-
ulations, potentially due to either unresolved
thermal instabilities or the absence of cool
cosmological inflows (Afruni et al. 2019).
(ii) Absence of cosmological context Our focus
on isolated elliptical galaxies excludes cos-
mological inflows, while inflows could en-
hance both X-ray luminosity (as noted in
ยง3.9) and cool gas content in the CGM. While
future work will incorporate these inflows,
we anticipate that their impact on feedback
physics may be limited, as Zhu et al. (2023b)
demonstrated minimal penetration of inflows
into galactic central regions, though this con-
clusion warrants verification in three dimen-
sions.
(iii) Exclusion of hot-mode AGN jets The current
implementation does not include AGN jets
during hot-mode accretion, despite their es-
tablished importance as feedback channels
and their role in creating observed X-ray cav-
ities (McNamara & Nulsen 2007; Heckman
& Best 2014). The effects of AGN jets within
the MACER framework are currently under
investigation (Guo et al., in prep).
(iv) Subgrid model limitations Our simulations
necessarily rely on several subgrid prescrip-
tions for processes including star formation
and metal enrichment. While such approxi-
mations are inherent to galaxy evolution sim-
ulations, we have deliberately chosen simple
implementations with minimal free parame-
ters to capture essential physics while main-
taining tractability. A comprehensive explo-
ration of alternative subgrid models lies be-
yond our current scope but merits future in-
vestigation.
(v) Non-thermal physics Our simulations do not
yet include important non-thermal processes
such as magnetic fields and cosmic rays,
which may significantly influence feedback
physics and gas dynamics, particularly in the
low-pressure CGM environment (e.g., But-
sky & Quinn 2018; Hopkins et al. 2020;
Ji et al. 2020; Buck et al. 2020; van de
Voort et al. 2021).
