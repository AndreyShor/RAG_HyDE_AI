Figure 11: Left panel: analytical reconstruction of flow profiles in the wide region of the
channel (representing the utricle), 𝑤(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠= 𝜋, 𝑡) for different values of the maximum
enlargement 𝑎𝑚. The inset shows the flow profiles in the thin region of the flow
𝑤(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠= 0, 𝑡); these remain symmetric, confirming the symmetry breaking mechanism
is not the same as the global symmetry-breaking mechanism discussed in § 3.2. Right
panel: correlation (as defined in (6.6)) between the axial velocity in the utricle
𝑤(𝑟) = 𝑤0(𝑟) + 𝜖𝑤1(𝑟, 𝜃) and the symmetric (solid) and asymmetric flow profile
(dashed). Curves show the results of the analytical computation and triangles and stars
show the correlations computed from the COMSOL solution. We find that the transition

whose behaviour could easily be characterized. In this way, we established two primary
regimes of flow-cupula interaction, depending on the value of the relative stiffness parameter
𝜅:
• Soft cupula regime, 𝜅≪1: When the cupular stiffness is relatively low, the deformation
of the cupula closely follows the angular velocity of the head. In this regime, the flow in the
canal exhibits symmetry about the centreline.
• Stiff cupula regime, 𝜅≫1: As the stiffness of the cupula increases, the deformation
transitions to follow the angular acceleration of the head. In this regime, the symmetry of
the fluid flow about the centreline is broken, creating distinct zones of differential flow. This
transition highlights the importance of structural properties of the cupula in shaping the
dynamic response of the vestibular system.
To verify the analytical findings, we conducted numerical simulations of the reduced
equations using COMSOL Multiphysics. The numerical results showed excellent agreement
with the asymptotic predictions, confirming the validity of the analytical approximations
across a wide parameter space. Importantly, the numerical approach enabled us to explore
the influence of complex fluid–solid interaction boundary conditions and the nonlinear,
advection, term in the Navier-Stokes equations that are otherwiseintractable analytically.
When the inertial terms were incorporated into the governing equations via inclusion of a
finite Stokes number, St, we observed important modifications to the system’s behaviour.
For small Stokes numbers, and in studying the relaxation of the cupula to an initial
deformation, the system exhibited overdamped dynamics. This behaviour is also predicted
when inertia is neglected, and is consistent with the low-Reynolds-number assumption
inherent to the vestibular fluid dynamics. However, for sufficiently large Stokes numbers, the
system exhibited underdamped oscillations, with the cupular deformation following angular
acceleration even in the soft cupula regime. This transition highlights the interplay between
inertial and viscous forces in shaping the dynamic response of the system. Physiologically,
