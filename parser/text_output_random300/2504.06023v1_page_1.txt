The introduction of the infinite boundary terms and the pairwise interactions [J. Chem. Theory Comput.,
10, 5254, (2014)] enables a physically intuitive approach for deriving electrostatic energy and pressure for both
neutral and non-neutral systems under the periodic boundary condition. For a periodic system consisting of N
point charges (with charge qj located at rj where j = 1, 2, · · · N) and one charge distribution of density ρ(r)
within a primary cell of volume V , the derived electrostatic energy can be expressed as,
U =

where rij = ri −rj is the relative vector and ν(r) represents the effective pairwise interaction. The charge
density ρ(r) is free of Delta-function-like divergence throughout the volume but may exhibit discontinuity.
This unified formulation directly follows that of the isolated system by replacing the Coulomb interaction 1/|r|
or other modified Coulomb interactions with ν(r). For a particular system of one-component plasma with a
uniform neutralizing background, the implementation of various pairwise formulations clarifies the contribution
of the background and subsequently reveals criteria for arbitrary volume-dependent potentials that preserve the
simple relation between energy and pressure.

INTRODUCTION
Since the seminal work of De Leeuw, Perram, and
Smith[1], it has been recognized that the Coulomb lattice sum
for electrically neutral systems of point charges is a condi-
tionally convergent series whose value depends on the chosen
order of summation. The essence of this conditional conver-
gence can be elucidated through a prototypical alternating se-
ries,
S = 1 −1 + 1 −1 + · · · .

Two summation conventions obviously exist:
S−= (1 −1) + (1 −1) + · · · = 0,
(2)
leaving the last number at the boundary always −1, and
S+ = 1 + (−1 + 1) + (−1 + 1) + · · · = 1,
(3)
leaving the last in the series always +1. A unified represen-
tation, S∓= Sbulk ∓1/2, admits two contributions to the
series: the bulk component satisfying the intrinsic periodic-
ity, S = 1 −S, which gives S = 1/2 = Sbulk[2], and the
boundary term, ∓1/2, reflecting the influence of the chosen
last number.
The Coulomb lattice sum can be analyzed analogously. As
the periodic lattice approaches infinity, distinct summation or-
ders correspond to different geometries or symmetries of the
lattice, each generating unique non-vanishing boundary term
in general. With the conditional boundary term removed, the
remaining bulk component becomes well-defined and can be

further expressed as a sum of two rapidly and absolutely con-
vergent series via the Ewald technique, that was first devel-
oped by Paul Peter Ewald in 1921[3]. The Ewald formulation,
now commonly referred to as the three-dimensional Ewald
summation associated with the tinfoil (conducting) boundary
condition (e3dtf)[1], has become fundamental to both molecu-
lar dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations
of condensed-phase materials.
Although the Ewald summation method has been exten-
sively revisited (e.g.[4–8]), it remains highly nontrivial to gen-
eralize the method for deriving expressions of energy and
pressure in complex periodic systems containing both point
charges and charge distributions represented by a charge den-
sity. The difficulty arises because, unlike the Coulomb en-
ergy of isolated systems, conventional Ewald formulations ex-
hibit analytical complexity and lack a physically well-defined,
easily generalizable pairwise decomposition. Indeed, for the
particular system of a one-component plasma with a uniform
neutralizing background, inconsistency between the outputs
of energy and pressure from the software LAMMPS[9] was
found[10]. This inconsistency has been identified as the lack
of a proper treatment of the background contribution[11, 12].
However, as remarked by Demyanov et al.[12], the proper in-
corporation of the background contribution remains unclear
in maintaining thermodynamic consistency between energy
and pressure calculations for systems governed by custom
volume-dependent potentials.
The recently proposed framework of pairwise decompo-
sition for periodic systems[13] establishes a promising ap-
proach for overcoming the difficulty.
