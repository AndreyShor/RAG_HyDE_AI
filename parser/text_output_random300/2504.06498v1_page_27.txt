Figure S4: Simulations of 𝐽-oscillators as a function of the feedback gain. The blue trace
represents the oscillator signal while the orange trace shows the population difference, calculated
as (3/4) × (population in 𝐾= 3/2, 𝐹= 2 states) - (5/4) × (population in 𝐾= 3/2, 𝐹= 1 states);
the scaling factors (3/4 and 5/4) account for the different number of available states in 𝐹= 2 versus
𝐹= 1 (see Fig. S3). The feedback delay was fixed to 𝜏= 222 ms; rms of the OPM noise was set
to 0.1 pT. As the feedback gain increases, the initial SABRE-pumped population imbalance can be
inverted during the burst events.
