Abstract—Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, particularly
water distribution systems, have increased due to rapid digital-
ization and the integration of IoT devices and industrial control
systems (ICS). These cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduce
new vulnerabilities, requiring robust and automated intrusion
detection systems (IDS) to mitigate potential threats. This study
addresses key challenges in anomaly detection by leveraging
time correlations in sensor data, integrating physical principles
into machine learning models, and optimizing computational
efficiency for edge applications. We build upon the concept
of temporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the
dynamics of the system, ensuring meaningful relationships be-
tween dynamic states [1]. Expanding on this foundation, we
propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach, referred to as
hybrid TDC-AE, which extends TDC by incorporating both
deterministic nodes and conventional statistical nodes. This hybrid
structure enables the model to account for non-deterministic
processes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification
performance while improving time to detect anomalies by 3%,
outperforming the BATADAL challenge leader without requiring
domain-specific knowledge, making it broadly applicable. Addi-
tionally, it maintains the computational efficiency of conventional
autoencoders while reducing the number of fully connected
layers, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient solution.
The method demonstrates how leveraging physics-inspired con-
sistency principles enhances anomaly detection and strengthens
the resilience of cyber-physical systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recent years have seen a marked increase in cyberattacks
targeting critical infrastructure, intensified by the rapid digi-
talization of these systems. Previously focused on IT network
security, the cybersecurity domain is expanding to encompass
essential services and critical infrastructures such as water
distribution, energy, and transportation [2]. Water distribution
networks are evolving into cyber-physical systems (CPS) that
blend physical operations with digital control via IoT devices
and industrial control systems (ICS). This integration exposes
new vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of cyber threats that
could compromise both safety and security [2]. Highlighting
the growing urgency of robust cyber defenses, recent incidents
have underscored the increasing vulnerability of water systems
to cyberattacks. Incidents in the United States in 2021 exposed
weaknesses in outdated access controls [3], [4]. In Texas,
hackers gained access to the SCADA systems of multiple
water plants, causing operational disruptions [5], while in the
UK, cybercriminals infiltrated water utilities, compromising
login credentials and exfiltrating sensitive data [6]. Similarly,
a ransomware attack on Veolia North America in 2024 forced
systems offline, disrupting customer services [7]. So far,
these attacks have been contained primarily through extensive
manual intervention by highly skilled professionals. However,
with the increasing frequency of cyber incidents and ongoing
demographic shifts leading to potential workforce shortages,
reliance on manual responses is becoming unsustainable. This
growing challenge underscores the urgent need for automated
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to enhance resilience and
ensure proactive detection and mitigation of cyber threats to
critical infrastructure [8], [9], [10].
This study makes contributions to three key challenges in
anomaly detection for CPS, specifically within the context
of water distribution systems. The first challenge is how to
leverage the strong time correlations present in the time series
data generated by physical processes. The second challenge
lies in enhancing machine learning models by integrating
physical principles directly into algorithms. The third chal-
lenge lies in making machine learning models more efficient
and lightweight for edge applications by integrating physical
principles and maintaining high performance in anomaly de-
tection while minimizing their computational footprint.

LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) have proven
to be highly effective in capturing temporal dependencies in
time series data [11], [12]. Recently, there has been growing
interest in applying LSTMs within autoencoders to enhance
the detection of anomalies in CPS [13], [14], [15]. While
