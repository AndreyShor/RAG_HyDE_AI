Table 1. The diﬀerent almost generic or smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds that appear in our examples,
together with some of the relevant topological invariants. Here κ is the triple intersection number
κ = eJ · eJ · eJ of the smooth deformation e
X while ˜b = eJ ·c2(T e
X). For the Picard-Fuchs operators we list
the AESZ number, except for the cases X4, for which the operator can be found in the database [30],
and X5 for which the operator is irrational and we construct it in Section 6. The ∗indicates that 225∗
and 4.70∗are obtained via pullback along a two-to-one covering map from the operators 225 and 4.70.
We recently learned about work in progress that, among other things, also discusses an
example of an almost generic Calabi-Yau threefold X with b2(X) = 1 and Z3-torsion [39]. To
our knowledge, the example is diﬀerent from the ones discussed in this paper and provides a
geometric interpretation for yet another AESZ operator. We thank the authors for informing
us about their work and for coordinating our submissions.
Outline
The outline of this work is as follows. In Section 2.1, we will ﬁrst review some
relevant geometric background and then introduce the notion of an almost generic Calabi-
Yau threefold. In Section 2.2 we then outline our general strategy to construct examples of
almost generic type by using conifold transitions, starting with Calabi-Yau threefolds that are
complete intersections in products of projective spaces. In Section 3 we review the properties
of the topological string A-model on a Calabi-Yau background (X, α) and of the B-model
on the mirror Calabi-Yau Wα. In particular, in Section 3.2 we discuss the modiﬁed integral
structure of the periods, generalizing previous results from [15, 16]. Our ﬁrst class of exam-
ples, leading to the almost generic quintics X1, X2 as well as the dual geometries Y1, Y2, is
discussed in Section 4. The second class of examples, containing the almost generic octics
X3, X4 and their dual geometries Y3, Y4, is constructed in Section 5. In Section 5.1 we give
a brief introduction to the subject of hyperdeterminants. The example X5 is discussed in
Section 6. The construction of the propagators, that are used to integrate the holomorphic
anomaly equations, as well as the BCOV ring are reviewed in Appendix A. While the B-model
data and the Z5-reﬁned invariants for X5 are discussed directly in Section 6, the correspond-
ing expressions for the examples Xa, Ya for a = 1, . . . , 4 are collected in Appendix B. The
