TABLE II. A sample of the computed dTEC normalisation scalings
for the 30 band-pairs used to calculate TEC and dTEC values, as
based on aggregated data from the KP “quiet” days 006 and 007 of
2022. A full table and explanation is given in the Supplementary
Material A.9. Here “Norm, C1.65” is the band pair scaling needed
to align the fitted widths if the η = 1.65 path-angles correction was
applied, whereas “Norm, C0” is that if no path-angle correction was
applied.

Band pair correction
The band pair used in any dTEC computation is an impor-
tant consideration, because the TEC (and hence dTEC) values
are uncalibrated, and are computed based on band pairs that
have frequency differences that span an order of magnitude –
∆f for L1CL2C is 356MHz, but for e.g. L7QL8Q it is only
15.345MHz. Further, the frequency differences fall broadly
into two groups, those with ‘large ∆f (i.e. > 250MHz), and
those with small ∆f (i.e. < 120MHz). This grouping is sim-
ply an artifact of the transmission frequencies used by GNSS
satellite constellations considered here.
If we try to normalise based on our quiet days reference,
using dTEC values without any path-angle compensation, we
find that the computed scaling factors for dTEC’s from differ-
ent bands can vary by up to a factor of two.
However, once the η = 1.65 path-angle compensation dis-
covered above is applied, the scaling factors – with only one
exception – fall within about 10% of unity, seen on Table II.
This unexpected reduction in the spread of band pair scaling
factors also helps give us more confidence in the application
of the η = 1.65 path-angle compensation.

Tails and widths
The “distribution width” measure WdT introduced above
does not include any width-like contributions from the fits to
the power-law tails; and so they were not included in the band
pair normalisation. This is because – as already discussed –
the tails have neither a natural width scale, nor any natural
amplitude scale. Further, they in no way (ever) contribute a
significant fraction of the number of dTEC values sampled.
However, that does not mean that the tail fitting parameters do
not contain useful information, but only that it is not straight-
forward to detrrmine to what extent they should (or might)
contribute to a combined width.
Since WdT is intended as a proxy for ionospheric activity,
the ability to consider adding an extra pseudo-width compo-
nent calculated from the tail fits (from e.g. (11) and (12))
seems desirable. This could capture and incorporate infor-
mation on the varying magnitude of dTEC under changing
ionospheric conditions, thus potentially increasing the accu-
racy and utility of WdT as an ionospheric scale (from which the
likelihood of ionospheric propagation disturbances in a given
region and over a given temporal interval can be deduced).
In the width and amplitude constructions below, we might
want to assume – in the absence of other determinations – that
the tail behaviour is of roughly equal importance as any of the
gaussian or exponential G2E contributions; for this we need
to compute a width-like parameter and an amplitude-like one
that vary over a similar range to the G2E ones.
To construct a width-like tail parameter we started from
the observation that exponents α8 typically vary between −2
(broad) and −5 (narrow), whilst typical gaussian and expo-
nential widths on quiet days (see subsection IV F) usually
have a minimum of about 0.05. Thus here we use an ad hoc
procedure where we assign an effective ”tail width” parameter
to be
ωT =
1
4|α8|,
(11)
where we insert the 1/4 to ensure that ωT, like the other
widths, also ranges from 0.05 upwards.
To construct an effective amplitude-like tail parameter (or
weighting) we integrate the power-law tail from the cut-off (at
α7) to infinity, and compare that to a tail normalised to have
unit area. Then, if we also multiply it by a factor of 50, we
bring it into same range or values as that for the gaussian and
exponential amplitudes (see subsection IV F). Recalling that
α9 is the amplitude of the tail feature, this rescaled normalisa-
tion approach gives us an effective “tail amplitude” of
βT = 50α9
αα8+1
7
α8+1 .
(12)
As a result, should we wish to apply it, we would add the
product βTωT of these two estimates to WdT to obtain a width-
like quantity that took these power law tails into account with
a broadly similar emphasis to the true width estimates:
W ∗
dT = WdT +βTωT.
(13)
Of course, these initial estimates as to how to incorporate
the significance of the power law tails are tentative, and in
future work we intend to place them on a firmer footing.
V.
UTC VERSUS LOCAL TIME
Before proceeding to the calculation of our index LdT, it
is instructive to analyse multi-day sets of data and see how
the ionosphere responds to the day/night cycle. To do this we
consider the two distinct temporal bases on which we might
divide the dTEC measurements: either by universal time (UT)
or local time (LT). We now proceed to compare representa-
tions of the data looked at in both ways; but in order to align
with our 30◦longitude divisions (dodecants), we base these
comparisons on slices containing two hours of data, rather
than our typical minimum – a single hour of data.
In Figs. 3, 4, 5 we compare three different sequences of
day-data organised by either universal time (UT) or local time
(LT). In all three sequences, we see that by LT the temporal
variation has a more regular and more pronounced modulation
as compared to that aggregated by UT; whilst noting that the
