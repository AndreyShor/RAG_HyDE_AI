SPM is an essential tool for investigating materials and nanoscale phenomena. Among its 
various imaging and functional spectroscopy modes, tapping mode (TM) is the most widely used 
[39-44]. However, achieving high-quality SPM images requires extensive tuning of microscope 
parameters, demanding significant time and expertise [45-47]. Automating the optimization of 
SPM at an expert level not only ensures standardized and reproducible high-quality imaging but 
also aligns with the principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability 
(FAIR), making high-quality SPM data more broadly available to the scientific community. 
In this work, we explore the application of multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) 
to autonomous experimentation in SPM. We demonstrate that MOBO effectively balances 
multiple uncertain reward functions, ensuring FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and 
Reproducible) access to high-quality experimental data. Furthermore, MOBO provides insights 
into the interdependencies among different reward functions and facilitates human-in-the-loop 
decision-making by enabling researchers to tailor trade-offs along the Pareto front for specific 
experimental goals. We illustrate these concepts through the automated optimization of tapping 
mode in SPM, where three reward functions are derived from either the underlying physics of the 
system or heuristic criteria. Our results show that MOBO rapidly optimizes control parameters, 
yielding high-quality and reproducible scans. Additionally, analysis of the Pareto front offers 
deeper insight into the relationships between competing rewards and provides a framework for 
integrating human expertise into the decision-making process.
