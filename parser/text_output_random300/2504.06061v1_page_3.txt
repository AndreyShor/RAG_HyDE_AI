Thus, the dispersion equation reads
det ˆ
M2 = 0,
(13)
which is fulfilled in either of the following cases:
Σ0κz −iε = 0, TE = 0 (TM wave);
(14)
or
κz = iΣ0 (1 −Ω/ω) , TM = 0 (TE wave).
(15)
For illustrative purposes we assume the Drude model
for the conductivity: Σ0 = 2πie2n2d/cm˜ω, where n2d is
the background sheet carrier density, ˜ω = ω + i/τp.
Equation (14) above corresponds to ordinary TM mode
with dispersion
ω˜ω = ω2
2d/ε,
(16)
where ω2
2d = 2πe2n0|kz|/m is the fundamental 2d plasma
frequency, which we make independent of ε by definition.
In turn, Eq. (15) corresponds to a two-dimensional TE
thermomagnetic wave with the dispersion
ωT MW = Ω
1
1 + A−2 −i
τp
1
1 + A2 ,
(17)
where we remind that Ω= −α1c(k, ∇T), and A =
ω2d/|kz|c is the retardation factor [15–17].
DISCUSSION
We observe that real parts of Eqs. (1) and (17) are
quite similar: the 2d TMW frequency is determined by
the same parameter Ω, which accounts for wave non-
reciprocity. Actually, Eq. (17) assumes the exact form
of Eq. (1) in the fully retarded limit (kz →0, A →∞,
the wave is totally delocalized) if we define σ3d
τ
= σ2d
τ kz.
Thus, we can conclude that the mode (17) is the searched-
for 2d thermomagnetic wave.
We checked that introduction of dissimilar dielectric
permittivities ε1 ̸= ε2 does not lead to any qualita-
tive changes and results only in a simple substitution
kz →(kz1 + kz2) /2 in the dispersion (17), where kzi =
p
k2 −εik2
0.
As a matter of fact, Eq. (17) is rather a condition for
(and not a solution to) the 2d TMW frequency as the re-
tardation factor A depends on kz which in turn depends
on ω. However, in the most important limit of a strongly
localized wave kz ≃k ≫√εk0, and Eq. (17) unambigu-
osly defines the 2d TMW frequency. The opposite limit
kz ≃0, k ≃√εk0 corresponds to a fully delocalized over-
damped wave, described by Fal’ko and Khmelnitskii in
their seminal work [18].
We showed the 2d TMW exists and is non-reciprocal.
But how well this mode is defined in terms of Q-factor?
By definition,
Q = Re ω/Im ω = ΩτpA2,
(18)
which in the limit of strong localization assumes the form:
Q = −α1 (ek, ∇T) 2π
c
e2n2dτp
m
,
(19)
where ek is the unit vector in the k direction. We note
that the 2d TMW Q-factor is independent of the wave
vector, analogously to 2d GMW [6].
The Q-factors of
3d TMWs and GMWs are proportional to k−1, which
stems from the different fundamental mode dispersions
ω3d ∝k0 vs ω2d ∝k1/2.
Let us conduct numerical estimates of the 2d TMW Q-
factor (19) and try to maximize it. Typically the Nernst-
Ettingshausen coefficient α1 does not exceed 100 µV/(K·
T) [19], carrier density is not greater than n2d = 5 ·
1012cm−2, one of the lowest effective masses is achieved
in bilayer graphene m = 0.03m0 (m0 is the mass of
a free electron), the temperature gradient is surely not
greater than 100 K/1 µm, and the samples with best mo-
bilities provide τp ≃10 ps. Substituting these values into
Eq. (19) we obtain Q = 0.003.
Numerical solution of
Eq. (17) justifies this result.
Thus, even though the absolute value of Im ω can be
lower than the standard damping rate 1/2τp (for A > 1
in the long wave length limit, see Eq. (17)), the Q-factor
cannot benefit from this fact. This situation is a direct
consequence of the 2d TMW localization dictated by kz;
in 3d case the TMW has no need in localization as it is
sustained by the surrounding media.
We can suggest two possible solutions to this problem.
The first option is to introduce the magnetic environ-
ment, which can add a factor of √µ to the Q-factor [6],
where µ is the relative magnetic permittivity. Still, this
will not be enough as µ does not exceed 50 in available
systems [20, 21]. Another option is to search for the ma-
terials with giant dynamic Nernst-Ettingshausen coeffi-
cient. We are unaware of any works on dynamic thermo-
magnetic phenomena in 2DESs despite a large amount of
literature concerning the static case [19, 22–24].
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we found a two-dimensional analog of
3d thermomagnetic waves in temperature-biased two-
dimensional electron systems. These waves are isother-
mal, TE-polarized and non-reciprocal. The 2d TMWs
arise as a result of the interaction between the dc tem-
perature gradient and ac magnetic field in 2DESs via
the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect. The Ohmic damping of
2d TMWs can be lower than that of ordinary 2d plasma
waves, though 2d TMW Q-factor is extremely low. Thus,
2d TMWs can hardly be observed even in state-of-the-
art 2DESs. Detailed examination of dynamic behavior of
the Nernst-Ettingshausen coefficient and use of magnetic
surroundings may help to overcome this issue.
