Appendix A. Numerical calculation of the scattering waves
We assume a localized one-dimensional potential (V (z) ̸= 0 for z0 < z < z1) and an
incident particle from the left. Since in all our cases the potential is asymptotically
zero in the external region, the wave function Ψ(l,−)
k
(z) in Eq. (8b) can be divided in
three diﬀerent regions:
Ψ(l,−)
k
(z) =



φI(z)
if
z < z0
φII(z)
if
z0 < z < z1
φIII(z)
if
z > z1.
(A.1)
First, the transmission
T (−)
l

and reﬂection
R(−)
l

2
coeﬃcients must satisfy
T (−)
l

2
+
R(−)
l

2
= 1. Then, the boundary conditions at the edges z0 and z1 are established,
requiring the continuity of the wave function and its derivative.
The proposed
procedure to obtain Ψ(l,−)
k
(z) is the following [23]:
(i) Given the energy of the incident particle E, an initial value of the complex
reﬂection parameter R(−)
l
is proposed, which must be restricted to a unit circle
because
R(+)
l

2
≤1.
(ii) Applying the continuity criteria, in Eq.
(A.1) we use the function φI(z) to
determine the function φII(z) and its derivative at the point z0.
(iii) The time-independent Schr¨odinger equation is solved in the intermediate region
by integrating from z0 to z1 using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method [20].
(iv) Knowing the function φII(z1), and applying the continuity conditions to Eq.
(A.1), the right-hand side function φIII(z) is obtained.
With it, we get the
transmission coeﬃcient given by T (−)
l
(k) = φIII(z1) eikz1.
(v) Using this value of the transmission coeﬃcient T (+)
l
(k), the equation is integrated
in the opposite direction (from z1 to z0), obtaining, in the central region of Eq.
(A.1), a new φII(z).
(vi) On the left edge z0,
the continuity conditions are applied,
determining
φI(z0). This allows obtaining a new complex reﬂection coeﬃcient R(−)
l

new =

φII(z0) −eikz0
eikz0 from Eq. (9b). We deﬁne a real function that corresponds
to the Euclidean distance between the old and new reﬂection coeﬃcients R(−)
l
and R(−)
l

new.
(vii) An iteration process is performed, such that it minimizes the distance between the
old and new reﬂection coeﬃcients R(−)
l
and R(−)
l

new. The integration problem
is now transformed into an optimization problem. In the present work, this is
done using the steepest descent method [20].
