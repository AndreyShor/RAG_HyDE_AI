Portfolio Optimization
Portfolio Optimization is the process of diversifying one’s assets to ensure an appropriate balance between risk
and expected returns. Portfolio Optimization has been used as a benchmarking problem for different variations
of QAOA [8, 27].
Given the asset price of 𝑛stocks, the goal is to find a vector 𝑥∈{0, 1}𝑛that maximizes return, minimizes risk,
and satisfies 1𝑇𝑥= 𝐵where 𝐵is a budget 1 ≤𝐵≤𝑛.
Following [8], 𝑆𝑖,𝑘, the price of asset 𝑖over time 𝑘is generated using Geometric Brownian Motion for 𝑁= 250
time steps and 𝑛assets:
𝑆𝑖,𝑘= 𝑆𝑖,0 exp[(𝜇𝑖−𝜎2
𝑖/2)𝑘/𝑁+ 𝜎𝑖𝑊𝑘],
(36)
with 𝑆𝑖,0 = 1 for all 0 ≤𝑖< 𝑛. Both the drifts, 𝜇𝑖, and the volatilities 𝜎𝑖are randomly generated using uniform
distribution set within the range [−0.05, 0.05] and [−0.20, 0.20], respectively. 𝑊𝑘= Í𝑗
𝑙=0 𝑧𝑙/
√
𝑁represents the
cumulative Brownian motion, where 𝑧𝑙is a random variable with a standard normal distribution.
For a set of asset prices, the return of asset 𝑖from time 𝑘to 𝑘+ 1 is, 𝑟𝑖,𝑘= 𝑆𝑖,𝑘/𝑆𝑖,𝑘−1 −1. Using these returns, a
covariance matrix Σ ∈R𝑛×𝑛and a mean return vector 𝜇∈R𝑛can be calculated [28].
The optimal asset vector 𝑥will then maximize
𝜇𝑇𝑥−𝑞𝑥𝑇Σ𝑥−𝜆(1𝑇𝑥−𝐵)2,
(37)
where 𝜆is a Lagrange multiplier for the penalty (budget) constraint.
This problem can be converted to a QUBO with 𝑄∈R𝑛×𝑛such that
𝑥𝑇𝑄𝑥= 𝜇𝑇𝑥−𝑞𝑥𝑇Σ𝑥−𝜆(1𝑇𝑥−𝐵)2.
(38)
For our experiments, we set 𝜆= sum(|Σ|) + sum(|𝜇|), 𝑛= 16, 𝐵= 8, 𝑞= 0.5.

Maximum Independent Set
Given a graph 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸) a subset 𝑈⊆𝑉is said to be an independent set if there are no edges between any of
the vertices of 𝑈.
The Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem is to find an independent set of maximum cardinality of an
arbitrary graph. This problem is equivalent to the NP-hard set packing problem [22]. There exist greedy ap-
proximate (classical) algorithms for MIS [29]. The MIS problem has also been previously studied with QAOA
in [30, 31]. Given a weighted graph 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸) with edge weights 𝑤: 𝐸→R, the MIS can be formulated as a
QUBO [3] where 𝑄∈R|𝑉|×|𝑉|
𝑥𝑇𝑄𝑥=
∑︁
0≤𝑖<|𝑉|
𝑥𝑖−𝑐
∑︁
(𝑖,𝑗)∈𝐸
𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑖𝑥𝑗
(39)
and 𝑐is a free variable controlling the weight of the penalty term. To ensure that the optimal vertex set is indeed
independent it’s required that 𝑐> 1. For our simulations, 𝑐was set to 1.1.
The graphs were sampled from two distributions: 11
• Erdős–Rényi random graphs (GNP) (see [32]). Here 𝑛= 16, 𝑝= 0.25,
• Newman–Watts–Strogatz random graphs (NWS) (see [33]). Here, 𝑛= 16,𝑘= 3, 𝑝= 0.5.
11The values for graph distrubution parameters were chosen so that both the binomial and Newman-Watts-Strogatz graphs had similar
independence numbers on average. If the graph generated is not connected we resample the distribution (i.e. rejection sample).
