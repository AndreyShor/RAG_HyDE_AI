single top-quark production in association with two jets [1017];
NLOQCD corrections matched to parton shower for single-top production in the t, s, and tW
channels available [927, 1005, 1018–1021]; NLOQCD matched to parton shower for single top-
quark production in association with a jet in the MiNLO method [1022]; Soft-gluon resummation
at NLL for single-top production in the t-channel [1023] and the s-channel modes [1024].
For single top production in the t channel, linear power corrections to the t-channel pro-
duction [1025] and including decays in the NWA [1026] have been obtained using renormalon
calculus. Beyond the phenomenological relevance of their work, the authors have shown that
there are no linear power corrections to the total production cross section, provided that it is
expressed in terms of a short-distance top-quark mass. When the top quark decay is included,
linear corrections do impact the total cross section, as well as polarization observables and
generic kinematic distributions of leptons originating from top-quark decays.
In Ref. [1027], a systematic computation of master integrals for the two-loop virtual am-
plitude for the non-factorizable corrections to t-channel single-top production at NNLOQCD has
been presented. The results are expressed in the form of Goncharov polylogarithm functions.
Single top production can also be used to constrain PDF fits [1028]. In this study, the
authors have shown that t-channel single-top-quark production can provide stringent constraints
for b-quark PDF. They also conclude that the b-quark mass uncertainty is the dominant theory
uncertainty for this process.
The tW process is actually part of the off-shell tt process [927]; nonetheless the process
is sometimes singled out in experimental analyses. In order to compute NNLOQCD corrections,
the last missing piece is the two-loop contributions. To that end, two-loop master integrals have
been obtained in Ref. [1029]. A further step has been taken in Ref. [1030] by completing the full
two-loop QCD amplitudes for tW production.

LH21 status: NLOQCD +NLOEW corrections known for off-shell top quarks and Z bosons [1031].
3.4.9
ttγγ
This process was not listed in the 2023 Les Houches wishlist. With the increasing luminosity
of the LHC experiments, it is justified to add it to the list of processes. In particular, it is the
main background for the measurement of Higgs production in association with a top-antitop
pair where the Higgs boson decays into two photons. This is actually one of the most sensitive
channel for the measurement of the ttH process [680, 1032].
The NLOQCD corrections and
their matching to parton shower have been known for many years [993,1033,1034] The NLOEW
corrections are also known [989].
In a recent study [1035], NLOQCD corrections to both the ttγγ production process as well
as the top decay have been computed in the NWA, while retaining spin correlations. Photon
radiation is also considered from the top quark decay products. Results are presented for both the
di-lepton and lepton+jet channel. The authors found that the effects of photon bremsstrahlung
are significant when two photons are emitted simultaneously in the production and decay of the
t¯t pair.
