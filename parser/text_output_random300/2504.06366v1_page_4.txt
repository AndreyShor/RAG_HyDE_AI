2 Materials and Methods 
2.1 Observational Datasets 
We use two gridded datasets of observed ocean potential temperature. These are datasets from 
Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) and the subsurface temperature analysis led by Ishii 
(hereafter Ishii). The IAP ocean potential temperature analysis has a horizontal resolution of 1° × 
1° with 41 vertical levels from the surface down to 2,000 m and spans the period 1940 to 2022 
(Cheng et al., 2018). The subsurface temperature analysis from Ishii has a horizontal resolution of 
1° × 1° with 28 vertical levels from the surface down to 3,000 m and spans the period from 1955 
to the present (Ishii et al., 2005). The upper 2,000 m OHC is calculated based on these datasets. 
Additionally, we use a reconstruction based on the Green's Function (GF) method which 
estimates the ocean temperature field (Zanna et al., 2019; Wu et al., accepted). The GF method 
utilizes a kernel derived from ocean tracer observations and surface “excess” temperature as the 
boundary condition, where “excess” excludes SST changes due to ocean circulation change. There 
are 12 GF kernels estimated from ocean tracer observations, 3 observational datasets for global 
SST, and 2 excess temperature fields from simulations, resulting in 72 members for the GF OHC 
estimate. More details are in Wu et al. (2022) and Wu et al. (accepted). 
For surface air temperature, we use the HadCRUT5 dataset, a widely used global temperature 
record that combines both in situ and satellite-based measurements (Morice et al., 2021). Covering 
the period from 1850 to the present, HadCRUT5 allows for a thorough comparison of model-
derived surface temperature changes over the historical period. 
 
2.2 Large-Ensemble Simulations and Single-Forcing Experiments 
This study uses the outputs from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 
(CMIP6), focusing on simulations from 6 selected models (ACCESS-ESM1-5, CNRM-CM6-1, 
CanESM5, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-LR) that have large ensemble simulations 
(≥ 25 members; Eyring et al., 2016). We also utilize the 50-member sub-ensemble, which follows 
the original CMIP6 biomass burning protocol, of the CESM2 large ensemble simulations 
(CESM2LE; Rodgers et al., 2021), in this study. These 7 models together provide outputs from 
the historical all-forcing (HIST) simulations, which include all major external forcings. In addition, 
the study also examines the results from single-forcing experiments from DAMIP (Gillett et al., 
2016) from these models, to which isolate the impact of individual forcings, namely greenhouse 
gases (GHG), anthropogenic aerosols (AER), and natural forcings like volcanic aerosols and solar 
irradiance (NAT) or everything else evolving in CESM2LE (Simpson et al., 2023). The number 
of realizations from each model is provided in Supporting Information (Table S1). These 
experiments aim to quantify the contributions of each forcing to changes in OHUE.
