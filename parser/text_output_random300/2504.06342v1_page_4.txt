studies of accretion disk physics. MACER2D has
studied the role of AGN feedback in the evolution
of massive slow rotators (Yuan et al. 2018), massive
fast rotators (Yoon et al. 2018), compact galaxies
(Di et al. 2023) and disk galaxies (Zou et al. in
prep), ISM properties of massive galaxies (Li et al.
2018), the impact and fate of cosmological inflow
in elliptical galaxies (Zhu et al. 2023b), the impacts
of different modes of AGN feedback (Yoon et al.
2019; Zhu et al. 2023a), and the effects of parameter
variation of AGN feedback (Yao et al. 2021).
Recent advances in computational capabilities
and improved understanding of feedback micro-
physics have enabled increasingly feasible and nec-
essary three-dimensional AGN feedback simula-
tions (Hopkins et al. 2024a,b; Guo et al. 2023).
These simulations more accurately capture turbu-
lence effects, instabilities, and non-axisymmetric
structures crucial for understanding multiphase
gas mixing in the ISM and CGM. Consequently,
we have developed the Multiscale AGN-regulated
Cosmic Ecosystem Resolver in 3D (hereafter
MACER3D) project, a three-dimensional hydro-
dynamic framework representing a comprehen-
sive upgrade of MACER2D. MACER3D incor-
porates numerous improvements in physical pro-
cesses and subgrid models, particularly focusing
on gas and stellar feedback physics, including cool-
ing/heating processes, SN feedback, and metal
yielding.
The framework enables controlled in-
vestigation of physical complexities while isolating
AGN feedback effects from other feedback mecha-
nisms.
The paper is organized as follows.
In §2, we
introduce the updated physical processes and setup
in the MACER3D framework. In §3, we present the
results from the simulations of an isolated elliptical
galaxy under the framework. Finally, we discuss
and summarize our main conclusions in §4.
2. METHODS
MACER3D incorporates a comprehensive up-
grade of the previous MACER2D framework. Be-
yond the expansion in dimensionality, MACER3D
incorporates a number of enhanced implementa-
tions of physical processes and subgrid models.
Notable improvements primarily focus on gas and
stellar feedback physics, including advanced cool-
ing and heating processes, realistic SN feedback
mechanisms, and detailed metal yielding. These
enhancements are detailed in subsequent sections.
The development roadmap of MACER3D includes
the incorporation of non-thermal physics such as
magnetic fields (Xia et al. in prep), and extends the
framework to diverse galactic systems, including
disk galaxies (Zou et al. in prep) and dwarf galax-
ies (Su et al. in prep), which will be presented in
future work.
2.1. Dimensionality and code base
A fundamental enhancement in MACER3D is the
implementation of three-dimensional physics, en-
abling more realistic modeling of AGN feedback
effects on galaxy evolution. This advancement of-
fers two key benefits. First, it allows for accurate
representation of turbulence, which is crucial for
understanding multiphase gas and metal mixing in
the ISM and CGM. This represents a significant
improvement over two-dimensional simulations,
which suffer from inverse energy cascade, leading
to artificial large-scale eddy formation and suppres-
sion of small-scale turbulence and mixing (Fjørtoft
1953). Second, the three-dimensional framework
enables the simulation of non-axisymmetric struc-
tures and instabilities, including spiral arms, grav-
itational torques, and thermal instabilities, which
significantly influence galaxy evolution and gas ac-
cretion onto the central supermassive black hole
(SMBH) (Balbus & Soker 1989; Binney et al.
2009).
The numerical foundation of MACER3D has
been modernized through the adoption of the
Athena++ code (White et al. 2016), replacing the
ZEUS code (Stone & Norman 1992; Hayes et al.
2006) used in MACER2D. Athena++ is a state-
of-the-art, open-source, high-performance, grid-
based hydrodynamic code optimized for astro-
physical applications.
Its implementation of the
