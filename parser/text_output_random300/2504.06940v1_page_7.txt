More generally, we can extend the phase estimation into the multivariate case, as an algorithm that we will call
“multidimensional phase estimation.” It is originally used to estimate the gradient of some function proposed in
Refs. [10, 11]. Later authors polished the results and referred to it as Jordan’s algorithm in Ref. [12]. We, in a similar
fashion as in Ref. [5], will reformulate results mainly following Ref. [12].
First, we consider vectors from the following set:
Definition II.38 (Hypercubic Lattice). For a dimension d and resolution N (which is usually a power of 2), define
the hypercubic lattice to be:
GN =

j ∈{0, 1, · · · , N −1} : j
N −1
2 −1
2N
d
(20)
The multidimensional phase estimation requires the following component which we call multivariate phase unitary:
Definition II.39 (Multivariate Phase Unitary). Given a vector ⃗x, a multivariate phase unitary U acts on HGN via:
U |⃗u⟩= e2πi⟨⃗u,⃗x⟩|u⟩
(21)
where ⃗u ∈GN, G is the hypercubic lattice for dimension d and resolution N.
Algorithm 1: Multidimensional Phase Estimation
Data: Resolution N, dimension d, Multivariate Phase Unitary U on HGN
Result: Some estimate of the phase ⃗y

⃗u∈GN |⃗u⟩;
Obtain state |φ⟩←U N |ψ⟩;
Apply inverse QFT: |ψ2⟩←QFT−1
GN |ψ1⟩;
Measure all dimensions and obtain the estimate ⃗y.
Now, algorithm 1 illustrates the process to recover the multivariate phase parameter ⃗x from the unitary. The
QFTGN represents Fourier transforming the register that corresponds to each dimension in ⃗u ∈GN. Its definition can
be found in Definition 5.2 (or Definition 17 in preprint) in Ref. [12]. The following theorem summarizes the accuracy,
which, as written in Ref. [12], is eventually sourced from Ref. [13].
Theorem II.40 (Multidimensional Phase Estimation). For each dimension α ∈[d], the probability for the outcome
of Algorithm 1 satisfy:
P
h
|xα −yα| > κ
N
i
⩽
1
2(κ −1)
(22)
In algorithm 1 we assumed that the unitary U is perfectly the multivariate phase unitary. If we are using some
other unitary V to approximate U N there will be another term in error:
Theorem II.41 (Multidimensional Phase Estimation with Noise). If we are using another unitary V in the place of
U N in Algorithm 1, such that we end up achieving |φ′⟩instead of |φ⟩, with ∥|φ′⟩−|φ⟩∥⩽ε for some ε, Eq. (22) is
modified to:
P
h
|xα −yα| > κ

2(κ −1) + 2ε

The proof for the above theorem is directly refactored from Lemma 5.2 (or Lemma 20 in preprint) in Ref. [12] with
specific values replaced by symbolic variables.
Corollary II.42. In theorem II.41 we might take ε =

Going to hybrid algorithms, we will use the fact that one can easily translate a hybrid circuit into a quantum
subroutine.
