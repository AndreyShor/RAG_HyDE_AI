SINGULARITY AND REGULARITY OF THE CRITICAL 2D SHF

1.2. New properties of the Critical 2D SHF. In this paper we investigate the
spatial regularity of the SHF. We focus on its one-time marginal Z ϑ
t pdxq, which is a locally
finite random measure on R2 with Z ϑ
0 pdxq “ dx and ErZ ϑ
t pdxqs “ dx for all t ě 0. Our
main result is that, for each t ą 0, Z ϑ
t pdxq is almost surely singular with respect to the
Lebesgue measure, and hence not a function.
Let UBpx,δqp¨q denote the uniform density on the Euclidean ball in R2:
UBpx,δqp¨q :“

where Bpx, δq :“

We will mostly focus on the SHF Z ϑ
t pdxq averaged over balls, that is

We can now state our first main result.
Theorem 1.1 (Singularity of SHF). Fix any t ą 0 and ϑ P R. Almost surely, the SHF
Z ϑ
t pdxq is singular with respect to Lebesgue measure on R2. In fact, the following holds:
almost surely,

for Lebesgue a.e. x P R2 .
(1.10)
The singularity of the SHF with respect to Lebesgue can be deduced from property (1.10)
via general arguments (see Proposition 3.2). In order to prove (1.10), we show that in the
“weak disorder limit” ϑ Ñ ´8, the SHF averaged on balls Z ϑ
t
`
UBpx,δq

is asymptotically
log-normal for radius δ “ δϱ
ϑ Ó 0 vanishing as any power of a suitable scale δϑ.
Theorem 1.2 (Log-normality of SHF in the weak disorder limit). Let us define
δϑ :“ e

2 |ϑ| ÝÑ 0
as ϑ Ñ ´8 .
(1.11)
Given any t ą 0 and x P R2, the following convergence in distribution holds:

(1.12)
Remark 1.3. We stress that the log-normality (1.12) emerges as ϑ Ñ ´8. For fixed ϑ P R,
the SHF averaged on balls Z ϑ
t
`
UBpx,δq
˘
vanishes as δ Ñ 0, as shown by (1.10).
On a different note, the SHF Z ϑ
t pdxq is not the exponential of a (generalised) Gaussian
field, i.e. it is not a Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos, see [CSZ23b].
In the proof of Theorem 1.1 we deduce (1.10) from (1.12) by exploiting the monotonicity
of fractional moments of Z ϑ
t pBq with respect to ϑ (see Lemma 3.1).
Using the scaling covariance property (1.7), we also show that the SHF locally vanishes
as the time horizon tends to infinity.

for any bounded set A Ă R2:

We finally investigate the regularity of the SHF Z ϑ

it has negative Hölder regularity C´ε for arbitrary small ε ą 0 (the definition of negative
