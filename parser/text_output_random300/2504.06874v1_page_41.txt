Fig. S24. Top layer sliding cannot account for green DW motion in Fig. 3f of the 
main text and Fig. S18a. a-c, Possible stackings obtained by sliding the topmost layer 
starting from ABCB, ABAC and CACB stackings, respectively. The domains with AA 
and BB adjacent stackings are unstable. The movement of the green DW cannot be 
achieved by sliding the topmost layer.
