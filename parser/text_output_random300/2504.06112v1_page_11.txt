FIG. 3: Fraction of cooperation heatmaps in (σ, ω) control parameter space for selected
values of temptation parameter b. Panel (a) b = 1.05. Panel (b) b = 1.10. Panel (c)
b = 1.15. For all the scenarios it is set µ = 0.2.
combined with the adaptive control mechanism for advantageous social environment creates
an expanded parameter space that fosters cooperation. In the subsequent analyses, we will
assume the number of players belonging to ΥSDG and ΥPDG stays fixed and equal to ω = 0.5,
thus half of the system plays SDG and the other half plays PDG.
Now, we delve into the impact of the social coupling parameter µ and the payoff σ on the
macroscopic fraction of cooperation. Fig. 4 reveals the behavior of the cooperation fraction
as a function of b for a variety of µ values and selected σ: (a) σ = 0, (b) σ = 0.2, (c)
σ = 0.5, (d) σ = 0.8. In the limit case of σ = 0, the totality of players in the system
are actually playing the weak PDG. Compared to previous research [48], we can observe
the positive effects of the parameter µ. Continuing with Fig. 4(a), we observe that when
individual behavior dominates (µ = 0), the fraction of cooperation is very low (≈0.3) even
for very small b and quickly decays to zero for increasing b. However, on the other extreme,
µ = 1.0, cooperation still dominates at b values as high as b = 1.4. Moving to higher σ,
Fig. 4(b) to (d), we see how this change also promotes cooperation. Cooperation fractions
are systematically higher as b increases, subsequently, the value of bc at which cooperation
vanishes is increased. In the case of σ = 0.8, cooperation can be remarkably sustained for
high b. In sum, in a system where half of the players play PDG and the other half play SDG,
the social coupling parameter µ promotes cooperation, and cooperation levels are further
fostered as σ increases. Even though increasing σ affects negatively cooperators in C-D
