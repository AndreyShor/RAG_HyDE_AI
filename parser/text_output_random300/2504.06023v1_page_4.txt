where the periodic series accounts for the contribution from
all replicas containing both the duplicated charges and the op-
positely charged neutralizing charges. When P approaches
infinity, ν∞(r, L) remains rigorously well-defined. It behaves
like the Coulomb interaction at small distances but deviates
at large distances. In fact, the spherically averaged deviation
is exclusively determined by the negative of the cubic infinite

This result is a direct manifestation of Newton’s shell
theorem—originally formulated for gravitational potentials—
stating that, outside any spherically symmetric charge (mass)
distribution, the potential is the same as if all the charge (mass)
were concentrated at a point in the center.
The lattice sum of 1/r defined in Eq. (12) properly incorpo-
rates the effect of PBC while excluding the infinite boundary
term. A similar definition applies to basic interactions other
than 1/r. For example, one may truncate the spherical aver-
age of νP (r, L) at the radius of the sphere with the equivalent
volume 4πr3
s /3 = V . The resultant modified Coulomb inter-
action, also called the angular-average (aa) Ewald potential,
reads[21–24]

and waa(r) = 0 for r > rs. waa(r) approaches zero with zero
derivative at rs. Its length scale is now characterized by rs.
Obviously, waa(|nL|) = 0 for any n ̸= 0 and the lattice sum
of waa(r) introduces no conditional convergence. Therefore,
the bulk component analogue to ν∞(r, L) in Eq. (12) can be
simply expressed as
νaa(r, L) = waa(r) +

waa(|r −nL|) + 3

(16)
where the constant 3/(2rs) has been added such that νaa(r, L)
behaves like the Coulomb interaction at small distances as
well. Due to the short-range nature of waa(r), the summations
over integers n1, n2, and n3 in the above equation are con-
strained to at most three discrete values: typically {−1, 0, 1}
for r ∈[−L, L]3.
The real-space expression [Eq.(16)] can be converted to a
Fourier-space expression via the well-known Poisson summa-
tion formula (e.g.[13, 23])

At small k, ˆwaa(k) should determine long-range electrostatic
correlations among charges[16, 36, 37]. In the limit k →0
with rs fixed, ˆwaa(k) approaches 2πr2
s /5, leading to the con-
stant term

On the other hand, in the limit rs →∞followed by ks →∞,
ˆwaa(k) asymptotically converges to 4π/k2, which coincides
with the Fourier transform of 1/r. Consequently, Eq. (17)
in this limit differs from Eq. (5) solely by the constant term.
Direct validation via the Poisson summation formula applied
to ν∞(r, L) confirms
ν∞(r, L) = νe3dtf(r, L)
∀r ∈[−L, L]3,
(20)
as rigorously derived in the Appendix.
Traditionally, the bare Coulomb interaction is often trun-
cated at a fixed cutoff distance (denoted as rc), independent of
both V and L (e.g.[16, 38–40]). The resultant truncated inter-
action wcd(r) might either decay sufficiently fast or smoothly
taper to zero with a vanishing derivative at r = rc. Using
wcd(r) as the basic interaction, the corresponding volume-
dependent effective interaction under PBC can be expressed
as a Fourier series
νcd(r, L) = τcd + 1

ei2πn·r/L ˆwcd(2πn/L),
(21)
where ˆwcd(k) is the Fourier transform of wcd(r) and τcd is a
constant determined by enforcing that νcd(r, L) −1/r strictly
vanishes in the limit r →0. Explicit forms of wcd(r) and
νcd(r, L) for common truncation schemes are provided in the
Appendix.
For both waa(r) and wcd(r), their short-range nature en-
sures the unconditional k →0 limits of their Fourier trans-
forms and the convergence of the Fourier series, Eqs. (17)
and (21), for any r, while the constants ξ/L, 9/(5rs) and τcd
guarantee the correct short-range behavior of the effective in-
teractions, νe3dtf(r, L), νaa(r, L), and νcd(r, L), respectively.
In the present work, we focus on systems with three-
dimensional periodicity. However, extending the rigorous def-
inition of the effective pairwise interaction to systems with
two- or one-dimensional periodicity (e.g., [13, 41, 42]) is
straightforward.

PROPERTIES OF THE EFFECTIVE INTERACTIONS
Before deriving the electrostatic energies, we examine the
properties of the effective interactions, νe3dtf(r, L), νaa(r, L)
and νcd(r, L), as formulated in both Fourier [Eqs. (5), (17)
