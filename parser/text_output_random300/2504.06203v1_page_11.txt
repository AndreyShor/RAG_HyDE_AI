The multiplet structure of the boundaries under fusion with topological defects follow from (A.4).
Below we will capitalize on these prior results to solve for the IR behaviors of these pinning flows following the strategy
explained in Section IV A.
Let us start with the simplest case O = ϕ2,2 (also known as the leading magnetization operator), the bulk flow breaks all
the symmetries and the bulk IR phase is trivially gapped, therefore from (III.2) we know the pinning defect is factorized into a
simple boundary condition of Mm,m+1. Since this is the most relevant flow, we expect factorization via the boundary with the
least g-function, which is the identity brane,
D+(ϕ2,2) = |1, 1⟩⟨1, 1| ,
D−(ϕ2,2) = |1, m⟩⟨1, m| .
(A.6)
The two flows are related by fusion with the Z2 defect L1,m since ϕ2,2 is Z2 odd.

FIG. 2: The fusion graphs for rank r fusion categories Wr and Rr. The shaded node is the generator of the graph. The n-th
node corresponds to either L1,2n−1 or L2n−1,1 (see discussion around (A.7)).
The pinning flows with O = ϕ2,1 or O = ϕ1,2 are more interesting because they preserve nontrivial symmetry subcategories.
It is straightforward to verify that they are generated by topological defects of the type L1,2i−1 or L2i−1,1 respectively. The
relevant fusion categories are presented in Figure 2 via their fusion graphs, where each node represents a simple object with the
shaded node denoting the distinguished generator Y of the fusion graph, and the edges between X, Z keep track of the fusion
channels in X ◦Y →Z. For small ranks, these are well-known fusion categories (see e.g. [78] and references therein)
W1 = R1 = Vec , W2 = Fib , W3 = Rep( [
so(3)5) , R2 = VecZ2 , R3 = Rep(S3) .
(A.7)
For m even, the symmetry category preserved by ϕ2,1 is W m
2 and it is R m
2 for ϕ1,2. For m odd, their roles are reversed, with
R m+1
2
for for ϕ1,2, and W m−1
2
for for ϕ1,2. This is intuitive since the adjacent minimal models Mm,m+1 and Mm−1,m are
related by an integrable RG flows triggered by ϕ1,3 [96], and operators ϕUV
1,2 and ϕIR
2,1 are related by the RG interface [102].
The corresponding bulk flows in these cases are integrable [96] and the IR phases are known to be gapped and realized by
TQFTs labeled by module categories for Wr and Rr depending on the sign of the deformation (see e.g. [103] for a summary).
The corresponding module categories are the regular module categories (from the module structure on the fusion categories
themselves) and one rank r−1 module category over Rr whose fusion graph is given in Figure 3 (defined in a similar way as for
the fusion graph of fusion categories and with the same generator as in Figure 2).
Following the discussion in Section IV A, we can then uniquely fix the factorization channels in (III.2) as follows,
D+(ϕ2,1) =
M
i=1,3,...,m−1
|1, i⟩⟨1, i| ,
D−(ϕ2,1) =
M
i=2,4,...,m
|1, i⟩⟨1, i| ,
D+(ϕ1,2) =

i=1,3,...,m−1
|i, 1⟩⟨i, 1| ,
D−(ϕ1,2) =
