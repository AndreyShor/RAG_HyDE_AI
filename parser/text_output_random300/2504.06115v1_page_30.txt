2. Similarly, the degeneration of Type A2 corresponds to
rank

A[1, 1]T A[1, 2]T 
= rank
 
A1,1,1 A1,2,1 A2,1,1 A2,2,1
A1,1,2 A1,2,2 A2,1,2 A2,2,2
!
= 1 ,
(5.24)
and we ﬁnd that IA ≃P1 is a rational curve of degree (1, 0).
3. Type A3 corresponds to
rank

A[2, 1] A[2, 2]

= rank
 
A1,1,1 A1,1,2 A1,2,1 A1,2,2
A2,1,1 A2,1,2 A2,2,1 A2,2,2
!
= 1 ,
(5.25)
such that there exists a linear combination of the two deﬁning equations of IA that
vanishes identically.
Without loss of generality we can assume that neither of the
equations vanishes itself identically and in that case IA is a rational curve
IA =

(5.26)
of degree (1, 1).
Restricting to subspaces
As our notation suggests, we have already understood concep-
tually how the nodes of Type A will arise. However, in order to get the nodes of Type B we
have to go one step further.
Let m ≥2 and consider a hypermatrix A of format 2 × (m + 1) × (m + 1) as well as two
ordinary matrices B and C of respective format (m + 1) × (m −1) and (m −1) × (m + 1).
We can then deﬁne a complete intersection
I =



m+1
X
i,j=1
A1,i,jxiyj =
m+1
X
i,j=1
A2,i,jxiyj = 0 , ⃗x B = C ⃗y = ⃗0


⊂Pm × Pm ,
(5.27)
where ⃗x and ⃗y are respective homogeneous coordinates on the ﬁrst and second factor of
Pm × Pm.
If the entries of A, B and C are chosen to be suﬃciently generic, then the set I will
consist of two points. On the other hand, if the matrices B and C have full rank, then we
can solve the equations
{⃗x B = C ⃗y = ⃗0 } ≃P1 × P1 ,
(5.28)
and translate the problem again into the form (5.17) for some 2 × 2 × 2 hypermatrix eA that
depends on the entries of A, B and C. In this way, after staring at the resulting expression
for a suﬃcient amount of time, we ﬁnd that in the space M of matrices A, B, C, the locus
where I degenerates is given by
{ det A = 0 } ⊂M ,
