investigates whether a Riemannian manifold with boundary can be uniquely determined by the
so called Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the Laplace equation. The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map in
general is an operator that sends a boundary value for a PDE to the normal derivative of the
solution corresponding to the boundary value. The connection of the anisotropic Calder´on prob-
lem to the bulk reconstruction in AdS/CFT, is that area data of minimal surfaces determines the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the minimal surface equation.
Despite over four decades of active research in inverse problems, the anisotropic Calder´on
problem remains unresolved in dimensions three and higher, with only limited progress achieved in
these cases [25]. For example, even the fundamental question of whether a Riemannian manifold
with the same boundary and Dirichlet-to-Neumann map as a Euclidean domain is Euclidean remains
open.
Nevertheless, recent advances in inverse problems for nonlinear PDEs, originating from [26], and
subsequently for Laplace-type PDEs from [27, 28], have opened promising new research directions.
For a recent survey, see [29].
These breakthroughs leverage nonlinearity as a powerful tool in
inverse problems, with the higher-order linearization method emerging as a key technique. This
method involves taking multiple derivatives of the nonlinear equation and the associated Dirichlet-
to-Neumann map with respect to small parameters in the data, enabling the recovery of various
coefficients in inverse problems. Recently, this approach was employed in [28] to reconstruct two-
dimensional minimal surfaces from their areas on three-dimensional compact Riemannian manifolds.
This general method is discussed in detail in Section 2.1.
One of the primary objectives of this work is to establish a link between recent progress in
the mathematics of inverse problems, particularly the results in [28], and the physics of the Ryu-
Takayanagi duality proposal, which relates areas of minimal surfaces to entanglement entropy.
Specifically, we aim to adapt the higher-order linearization method to the study of the duality in
asymptotically AdS spacetimes. With natural modifications, we anticipate that these methods will
also find applications in the context of the Hubeny–Rangamani–Takayanagi proposal for extremal
surfaces.
1.1
Problem statement and methodology
Per holographic duality, the area A of a minimal surface Σ corresponds to the entanglement entropy
of the associated boundary region A [30],

(1.1)
where ∂Σ = ∂A and GN is the Newton constant, which can be related with QFT quantities in
string theory settings. See Fig. 1 for an illustration. If one knows the metric of bulk spacetime,
then it would be a straightforward exercise to compute the area A of the codimension-two minimal
surface Σ. The bulk reconstruction problem arises from knowing, in principle, the left-hand side
of (1.1), the entanglement entropy, and seeking to determine the corresponding bulk geometry that
would reproduce the area on the right-hand side. This constitutes an inverse problem, where one
aims to infer geometric data from boundary entanglement information.
However, it is important to recognize that the quantity in (1.1) is formally divergent, and thus
the entanglement entropy itself cannot directly serve as input data for reconstructing the bulk
geometry.
Instead, variations of the entanglement entropy relative to a reference configuration
provide a well-defined and physically meaningful starting point. It is natural, then, to ask how does
the entanglement entropy responds to changes in external parameters, or to deformations in the
size or shape of the entangling region A. These variations induce corresponding changes δA in the
areas of the associated bulk surfaces, thereby encoding information about the underlying geometry.
