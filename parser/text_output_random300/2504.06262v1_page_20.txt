Figure 9 (a) Typical experimental set-up for thermo-optic
medium from (Xu et al., 2015). The beam from a CW laser
is sent into the nonlinear material.
The sample is a cylin-
drical tube filled with a solution of methanol and graphene
nanoscale flakes. Top left: the typical non-local response of
the medium obtained by numerical simulation of the diffusion
equations from (Vocke et al., 2016). (b) Non-local Bogoliubov
dispersion. Data are adapted from (Vocke, 2017) and corre-
spond to a non-local length of σT = 118µm (red). The local
dispersion relation is plotted in blue for comparison. K is the
transverse wavevector k⊥and Ωis the Bogoliubov pulsation
as defined in Eq. (43) and applied for non-local nonlinearity
following Eq. (77). Ωis converted from m−1 to s−1 with the
rescaling used in Eq. (31).
Numerical calculations incorporating realistic beam
profiles (such as Gaussian beams) and finite bound-
ary conditions refine these approximations, providing in-
sights into the spatial extent of thermal nonlinearities.
The characteristic width σT is typically estimated nu-
merically, and its accurate determination is essential to
describe nonlinear optical effects accurately.
Thermal nonlinearities have been studied in various
liquids, with methanol and methanol-based solutions
(such as methanol/graphene mixtures) being commonly
used due to their strong negative thermo-optic coefficient.
Unlike electronic Kerr nonlinearities, thermal nonlinear-
ities exhibit response times on the millisecond to second
scale. This allows to tune the effective photon-photon in-
teraction as a function of time (Vocke et al., 2015). The
experimental setup typically involves a bulk liquid sam-
ple contained in a cylindrical cell with optical windows,
through which a laser beam propagates, see Fig. 9(a).
The absorption of light induces a temperature gradient,
leading to a refractive index profile that mediates photon-
photon interactions over macroscopic distances. In this
case the Bogoliubov dispersion relation is strongly mod-
ified by the non-locality.
This has been measured by
(Vocke et al., 2015) and analyzed by (Fontaine et al.,
2020). A typical dispersion relation is shown in Fig. 9(b).

VI. EXPERIMENTAL AND NUMERICAL TECHNIQUES
FOR FLUIDS OF LIGHT
This section aims to describe the techniques used for
paraxial fluids of light experiments and numerical sim-
ulations. Several techniques are derived from nonlinear
and quantum optics while others have been adapted from
ultracold atomic quantum gases.
A. Arbitrary state generation: SLM’s and DMD’s.
The first step in fluid-of-light experiments is the prepa-
ration of the initial state by controlling both its intensity
and phase. A spatial light modulator (SLM) enables the
generation of arbitrary classical optical states, providing
independent manipulation of phase and amplitude. Typ-
ically, an SLM modifies the phase of an incoming optical
field pixel by pixel. Amplitude shaping is achieved in-
directly by encoding a suitable wavefront pattern, such
as a blazed grating, allowing the desired intensity pro-
file to be isolated through spatial filtering in the Fourier
plane. This filtering is commonly implemented with an
iris placed at the focal point of a 4f-system. Several tech-
nical details can be found for SLM and digital micromir-
ror devices (DMD) in the work of (Popoff, 2024) and in
the review written by (Gauthier et al., 2021).
We note E(x, y) = a(x, y)eiϕ(x,y) the target field, with
the normalized amplitude a ∈[0, 1]. The general problem
is to find the phase function Ψ[a, ϕ](x, y) to be displayed
on the SLM, that generates the target field after filtering
in the Fourier plane. After reflection on the SLM, the in-
cident electric field is multiplied by the transfer function:

with hj[a, ϕ] the jth term in the Fourier series expansion,
and ck(a) the Fourier series coefficients. The x and y vari-
ables have been dropped in the interest of brevity. With
these definitions, the condition on c1 to retrieve the target
