A measure-valued process
As we have already briefly mentioned, an interesting situation where Theorem C can be applied is
when the admissible fields are given by the increments of the martingale approximation of the ⋆-scale
invariant field X. More precisely, we note that for all t, s ≥0 it holds that
Xt+s(x) = Xt(x) + Ws,t(x) ,
∀x ∈Rd ,
where Ws,t(·) = Ws(et·) with Ws(·) a centred Gaussian field independent of Ft and such that
E[Ws(x)Ws(y)] =
Z s
0
K(eu(x −y))du ,
∀x, y ∈Rd .
For γ >
√
2d, the measure µγ,t+s can then be rewritten as
µγ,t+s(dx) = eγ(Ws,t(x)−

Furthermore, for any finite collection of non-negative numbers (s1, . . . , sn) ⊆R+
0 , the family of
fields (Wsi,t)i∈[n],t≥0 satisfies (W1) – (W4). Therefore, by Theorem C and Kolmogorov’s extension
theorem, there exists a process (νγ,s)s≥0 taking values in the space of non-negative, locally finite
measures on Rd such that the collection of measures (νγ,s1, . . . , νγ,sn) is the σ(X)-stable limit of
(µγ,t+s1, . . . , µγ,t+sn) as t →∞.
Let Ψ denote the field appearing in (2.12). For all s ≥0, we define the field Ψs on Rd by letting
Ψs(·) = Ψ(e−s·) + (Ws(e−s·) −

As a consequence of (2.15), we then have the following corollary of Theorem C.
Corollary D. For γ >

Let (xj, wj)j∈N ⊆Rd ×[0, ∞] be an arbitrary enumeration of the atoms of the Poisson point measure
ηγ[µγc] as introduced in Definition 1.5. Consider the collection of measures (νγ,s)s≥0 defined as

(2.18)
where (Wγ,s,j)j∈N is a collection of i.i.d. copies of Wγ,s, independent of ηγ[µγc]. Then, the
collection of measures (µγ,t+s)s≥0 converges σ(X)-stably in the finite dimensional sense to the
collection of measures (νγ,s)s≥0 as t →∞.
We conclude this section with a couple of remarks and conjectures.
Remark 2.18 (Stationarity modulo tilt). For s ≥0, write xs = argmax{Ψs(x) : x ∈Rd}, Zs =
Ψs(xs), and eΨs = Ψs(xs +·)−Ψs(xs). Fix a finite collection of non-negative numbers (s0, . . . , sn) ⊆
R+
0 such that s0 ≤. . . ≤sn, and consider the joint limit of (µγ,t+si)i∈[n] as t →∞. For all
(fi)i∈[n] ∈(C+
