FIG. 2. 68% and 95% credible intervals constraints on the dark energy equation-of-state parameters (w0, wa) for various data
combinations. The left panel displays results based on DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) measurements, while the right panel shows
Data Release 2 (DR2). Different colors indicate distinct dataset combinations, as labeled. In all cases we assume in addition
a BBN constraint on Ωbh2 and a CMB constraint on θ∗. The parameter space is subdivided according to four dark energy
models: Quintom A (w > −1 in the past and w < −1 today), Quintessence (w > −1 at all epochs), Phantom (w < −1 at all
epochs), and Quintom B (w < −1 in the past but w > −1 today). The intersection point of the two dashed lines corresponds
to the ΛCDM limit (w0, wa) = (−1, 0).
ble 5) by 75% to account for potential broadening of θ∗
constraints in extended cosmological models.
Our baseline dataset comprises DESI BAO mea-
surements, the BBN prior on Ωbh2, and the CMB
acoustic-scale constraint on θ∗. We then supplement
this baseline with each of the three SNe samples in
turn: ‘DR1(2)+PantheonPlus’, ‘DR1(2)+Union3’, and
‘DR1(2)+DESY5’ for the DES 5-year sample. Each com-
bination is analyzed independently to gauge its impact on
w(z) constraints.
Fig. 2 shows the inferred constraints on (w0, wa) for
different data combinations. The left panel corresponds
to DESI DR1, while the right panel presents DR2. Con-
tour colors indicate various datasets, with inner and outer
contours marking 1σ and 2σ confidence intervals, respec-
tively. We divide the parameter space into four dark en-
ergy models: Quintessence (w > −1 at all epochs, thus
w0 > −1 and w0+wa > −1) [10], Full Phantom (w < −1
at all epochs, thus w0 < −1 and w0 + wa < −1) [11],
Quintom A (w > −1 in the past but w < −1 today,
thus w0 < −1 and w0 + wa > −1) [12], and Quintom B
(w < −1 in the past but w > −1 today, thus w0 > −1
and w0 + wa < −1) [12].
Using only DESI DR1 BAO measurements yields con-
straints that are broadly consistent with ΛCDM, albeit
with mild (∼1.5–2σ) hints of departure. Incorporating
supernova data narrows these contours further, indicat-
ing a slight preference for dynamical dark energy. A sim-
ilar pattern emerges from the DR2-only analysis, which
achieves notably tighter constraints than DR1 and favors
w0 > −1 with wa < 0, consistent with a Quintom B-
like scenario. Even so, ΛCDM remains viable at ∼1.5σ.
This is weaker than the 2.3σ rejection of ΛCDM in [44]
from DESI+CMB, because our CMB prior uses only part
of the information, and also because we have chosen to
inflate uncertainties. When DR2 is combined with su-
pernova data, the best-fit values stay in the Quintom B
region, pushing the tension with ΛCDM above 2σ, show-
ing somewhat stronger preference for departure from a
simple cosmological constant (see Tables I and II in the
Supplemental Material for more details).
To delve deeper into the dynamical nature of dark en-
ergy, we perform a non-parametric Bayesian reconstruc-
tion of w(z) using the correlation-prior framework orig-
inally proposed in [61, 62] and subsequently applied in
[63, 64]. In this methodology, w(z) is treated as a free
function, while a correlation prior enforces smoothness
and mitigates flat directions in the likelihood. The corre-
lation prior itself can be motivated by theoretical consid-
erations [65]; here, we adopt the version derived in [65]
