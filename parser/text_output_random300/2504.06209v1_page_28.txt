FIG. 14. Information diagram used in the proof of Lemma 8. Relevant information atoms are labeled.
Rewriting the left-hand side using the chain rule for mutual information in the form of eq. (A10) with W = Aj+1Sj,
X = MtAt+1:j+1St:j, Y = A0:t+1S0:t and Z = Mj gives
I [MtA0:j+1S0:j; Aj+1Sj|Mj] = I [MtAt+1:j+1St:j; Aj+1Sj|Mj] + I[A0:t+1S0:t; Aj+1Sj|MtMjAt+1:j+1St:j].
(F18)
Since the left-hand side vanishes (eq. (F17)), the nonnegativity of mutual information implies that both terms on the
right-hand side must independently vanish; in particular, I[A0:t+1S0:t; Aj+1Sj|MtMjAt+1:j+1St+j] = f = 0. Further,
since eq. (F15) and eq. (F16) imply l = 0, we can then write
I [A0:t+1S0:t; Aj+1Sj|MtAt+1:j+1St:j] = f + l = 0
(F19)
for all j > t. Together, this then completes the proof of eq. (F10) for all j ≥t.
Applying the chain rule of mutual information (eq. (A9)) to eq. (F10) yields

I [A0:t+1S0:t; Aj+1Sj|MtAt+1:j+1St:j] = I [A0:t+1S0:t; At+1:∞St:∞|Mt] = 0.
(F20)
Further, by the chain rule of mutual information ( eq. (A10)) we have
0 = I [A0:t+1S0:t; At+1:∞St:∞|Mt]
(F21)
= I [A0:t+1S0:t; St:∞|Mt] + I [A0:t+1S0:t; At+1:∞St:∞|MtAt+1:∞] .
(F22)
Now, by the nonnegativity of mutual information, each summand ion the right-hand side must vanish individually.
In particular, (I [A0:t+1S0:t; St:∞|Mt] = 0 which concludes the proof of the lemma.
The previous lemma can be used to show that definition 12 reduces to the condition given in eq. (F1) in the case
where the global process is stationary and the environment is modeled by a product environment channel. A stochastic
process is said to be stationary if its distribution pX admits [33, p.87]
pXn:m = pXn+t:m+t
(F23)
for all n, t ∈N0 and m > n where pXn:m is obtained from pX through marginalization.
Theorem 6. Let agtM →
←env be such that the joint process MAS of actions, percepts, and agent memory is stationary.
Then, agtM is a.m. predictive, i.e.,
⟨I[A0:t+1S0:t; St|Mt]⟩t = 0
(F24)
if and only if
I[A0:t+1S0:t; St:∞|Mt] = 0
∀t ∈N0.
(F25)
If in addition env is a product channel (definition 8), agtM is a.m. predictive if and only if
I[S0:t; St:∞|Mt] = 0
∀t ∈N0.
