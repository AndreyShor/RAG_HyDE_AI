Abstract 
The quantum dots (QD) interface in solution can play significant roles in electron trans- 
fer dynamics for quantum dots-sensitized solar cells and different biological, environmental, 
and industrial systems. Here we predict an avenue to identify the contribution of quantum 
dots’ interface-created static electric field, on the nonlinear optical response (NLO) due to 
four-wave mixing (FWM), especially for the nanoparticles where surface contribution is high. 
We implement a way to disentangle the FWM response in QDs, originating from the three in- 
coming oscillating laser fields (NLOoscillating) and a contribution (NLOstatic) arising from the 
three oscillating laser fields and the static electric field caused by the interface. Advanced two- 
dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) employs phase-resolved heterodyne techniques 
where FWM response is measured in a particular phase-matched direction and the response is 
distinctively phase sensitive. Theoretical analysis shows alteration in the interface can intro- 
duce phase variation in the NLOstatic signal resulting in distinct change in the 2D-spectra. Our 
studies establish a range of ionic strength (10−6M < x < 10−3M), which can be important to 
untwine, the usual NLO signal (NLOoscillating) from the NLO (NLOstatic) contributed by the in- 
terface of quantum dots. This analysis may open up the possibility to study the different kinds 
of dynamics occurring specifically in the interface and also will pave the path towards different 
ion interactions through phase change in 2D spectra and enormous scope will be employing 
deep learning-assisted phase recognition. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Quantum dots and nano-particles exhibit elevated surface-to-volume ratios, wherein the interfaces 
between these nano-particles and their surrounding environment exert crucial influences on their 
inherent physical and chemical characteristics.1–4 
Especially the electron or proton transfer or the energy transfer dynamics at the interface can be 
influenced significantly depending on the nature of the interfaces. Understanding the nature and the 
role of the interfaces is fascinating to understand the overall ultra-fast dynamics of those systems.
