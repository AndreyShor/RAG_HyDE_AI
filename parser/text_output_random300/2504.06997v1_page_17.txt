information. In short, there is a trade-off between brain sensitivity and the model’s ability to isolate 
extracerebral confounders in our current system. 
Regarding noise characterization in SPAD experiments, our approach provides an approximate 
representation of real noise. Noise levels can vary based on the detection region and source power, 
which means that including a broader range of noise levels would improve robustness to 
experimental variations. However, due to computational constraints, only three noise levels were 
incorporated into our dataset. Additionally, 𝜌𝜌 was fixed at 35 mm for subject-specific calibration, 
and the optical properties (𝜇𝜇𝑎𝑎 and 𝜇𝜇𝑠𝑠
′) in the extracerebral layer were fixed. Expanding the range 
of ρ and sampling more extensively across other model parameters would enable broader coverage 
of application scenarios using the proposed method, supporting both longitudinal studies and inter-
subject comparisons. We also applied a min-max scaling to both experimental and simulated data. 
This ensured matching ranges but could alter the shape of the ACF curve slightly (caused by noise), 
effectively introducing a small systematic difference between how labels were generated and how 
experimental data appear. In future work, more sophisticated normalization or data augmentation 
strategies could be explored to bridge this gap. 
During the lunch test, we observed slight fluctuations in recovered rCBFi curves across different 
test phases. Since these tests were conducted separately at different time points, variations in noise 
due to hardware instability may have contributed to these fluctuations. Factors such as slight 
differences in probe positioning, applied pressure, and detected photon count across trials could 
affect measurements as well. Besides, the SPAD array is highly sensitive to movement, vibration, 
breathing, and airflow in the test environment, all of which could introduce measurement 
instability. Increasing the number of noise levels in future studies may help address this issue. 
Moving forward, we will implement additional noise levels and optimize probe design to reduce 
motion and pressure variations in real-world applications. This data-driven approach can be further 
enhanced by incorporating additional measurement modes (e.g., multi-distance or time-resolved 
DCS) to provide the model with richer information for separating tissue layers. 
The proposed SPAD-DCS integrated with DL method can be a complementary to TD-DCS, it 
achieves blood flow discrimination in the computational domain rather than the hardware domain. 
This could be pitched as a cost-effective solution compared to full TD systems. Furthermore, our 
method holds the ability to non-invasively monitor cerebral blood flow with high temporal 
resolution has broad neurophotonics implications. Competing modalities (fMRI, PET) are too slow 
or impractical for continuous monitoring. Traditional DCS is promising but struggled with 
accuracy at deep layers. The contributions of this work (layer-aware DL model + high-SNR SPAD) 
address those limitations head-on, bringing DCS closer to a viable neuro-monitoring tool for brain 
health. For example, real-time bedside monitoring in neurocritical care, neurovascular coupling 
studies, or augmented neuroimaging combined with functional near-infrared spectroscopy 
(fNIRS).

Conclusion 
In this work, we demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of using a DL model based on the 
two-layer DCS analytical model, combined with a SPAD sensor for CBFi monitoring. The 
proposed DL model significantly improves CBFi sensitivity and rCBFi accuracy while exhibiting 
a comparable ability to an early-lag single-exponential fitting in minimizing superficial layer
