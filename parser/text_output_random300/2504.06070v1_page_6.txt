very short time interval, assuming steady flow, we can approximate the temporal evolution of c(x, t)
as a monotonic bounded function. Since t′ lies between tk and tk+1, we have:
||c(x, t′) −c(x, tk)||2
2 ≤||c(x, tk+1) −c(x, tk)||2
2.
(14)
Based on this, we establish the residual term as follows:
LTemporal(x, tk) = max{||c(x, t′) −c(x, tk)||2
2 −||c(x, tk+1) −c(x, tk)||2
2, 0}.
(15)
This implies that if ||c(x, t′) −c(x, tk)||2
2 is less than or equal to ||c(x, tk+1) −c(x, tk)||2
2, we
consider the concentration at time t′ to be optimized within an acceptable error range, and the loss
term for this component is set to 0. However, if ||c(x, t′) −c(x, tk)||2
2 is greater than ||c(x, tk+1) −
c(x, tk)||2
2, we consider the concentration value at time t′ to require further optimization.
In summary, our loss function assembles the above constraints and is written as:

EXPERIMENTS
We extensively evaluate our model across four benchmarks, including both simulated and real-world
scenarios, as well as 2D and 3D settings. The training and testing data consist solely of observable
data. Overview of the data with spatial resolution can be found in Figure 3.

Baselines.
Given the simulated
data, we compare our model with
seven recognized advanced mod-
els, including five baselines that
are purely data-driven to approxi-
mate complex mapping: FNO (Li
et al., 2020), F-FNO (Tran et al.,
2023), U-FNO (Wen et al., 2022),
U-NO (Rahman et al., 2022) and
LSM (Wu et al., 2023), and a base-
line that utilizes established ve-
locity fields to assist predictions:
HelmFluid (Xing et al., 2024),
and two other baselines for vision
tasks: U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015) and ResNet (He et al., 2016).
Fluid 2D. We consider a scenario where a substance is transported by fluid flow through a pipe. An
incompressible fluid with a certain concentration flows from left to right, passing through multiple
solid objects with varying positions and shapes. The substance is advected and diffuses with the
fluid, and its concentration is the observed data. The real-world scenario involves the transport of
dye carried by water flow through a pipe. To evaluate the model’s temporal extrapolation and spatial
generalization capabilities, the training process involves predicting the next 5 frames of concentra-
tion based on the previous 4 frames. During testing, the model is challenged to predict 40 future
frames of concentration from the 4-frame input. Additionally, the test set includes variations such
as the addition, removal and shape changes of obstacles, which were not present in training set.
