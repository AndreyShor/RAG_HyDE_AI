tz¯1, ˜tz1 ≥0. In this limit, we can apply a multi-step per-
turbation procedure to show that the system hosts chiral
hinge states propagating along the x direction. As a first
step, since all energy scales are small compared to the
chemical potential µ, we linearize the spectrum around
the Fermi points ±kF by rewriting the Hamiltonian in
a basis composed of slowly varying right moving fields
Rnmτνσ(x) and left moving fields Lnmτνσ(x) inside each
wire (see, e.g., Ref. [21]):
Ψnmτνσ = eikF xRnmτνσ + e−ikF xLnmτνσ.
(12)
In what follows, to simplify our notation, we work in
terms of the Hamiltonian density H determined by H =

this form. In terms of the new fields, the kinetic part
corresponding to Eq. (1) becomes

with the Fermi velocity vF = kF /m0. Hereinafter, we
neglect all fast-oscillating contributions.
Next, we focus on the Zeeman and y-tunneling terms
given by Eqs. (4) and (5) as these terms are assumed to
be dominant in our parameter hierarchy. In terms of the
right and left movers, these terms take the form

(15)
At this point, we see that the states Ln11¯1¯1, RnNy11¯1,
Rn1¯1¯1¯1 and LnNy¯11¯1 do not enter either one of these
terms, and, hence, they remain gapless for now. These
gapless states are located on the xz surface of the sample.
On the other hand, all other states in the bulk and on
the xy surfaces of the sample are fully gapped out, see
also Fig. 2.
In the next step of the perturbation procedure, we take
into account the tunneling processes in the z direction.
In the same way as before, we rewrite Eqs. (6) and (7) in
the basis of the new fields:

These terms couple the remaining gapless states on
the xz surfaces, which become fully gapped as a re-
sult.

FIG. 2. Sketch of four unit cells of the coupled-wires model
with l = 1.
Parabolas represent the energy spectrum E0
of electrons freely propagating along the wires. For clarity,
initially twofold degenerate parabolas are shown separately:
green (blue) parabolas represent spin-down (spin-up) elec-
trons. The spin quantization axis is set along the z axis, and
the direction of spins is shown by green and blue arrows. The
double arrows represent the magnetic and interwire terms in
leading order of the perturbation theory. These terms result
in a fully gapped bulk, fully gapped surfaces, and two gap-
less chiral states R1Ny11¯1(x), LNzNy¯11¯1(x) localized to two
hinges of the sample (denoted by red solid ovals). Changing
the boundary termination by removing the last layer in the
xy plane at n = Nz, τ = ¯1 leads to the relocation of one
hinge state from LNzNy¯11¯1(x) to LNz11¯1¯1(x) (denoted by the
red dashed oval).
the sample are left uncoupled: the right mover R1Ny11¯1
at (n, m) = (1, Ny) and the left mover LNzNy¯11¯1 at
(n, m) = (Nz, Ny), see the red ovals in Fig. 2.
These
states, which carry a single electron charge e, represent
the chiral hinge states we are looking for.
Up to now, we have assumed that the wires are in-
finitely extended along the x direction. However, for the
sake of completeness, we should also study the proper-
ties of a finite 3D sample. We start by noting that, in
the absence of interwire hopping terms along the z direc-
tion, our 3D model consists of decoupled two-dimensional
(2D) layers stacked along the z direction. In our param-
eter regime of interest, ∆B ≫ty, it has previously been
shown that a single one of these layers realizes a QAH
phase with a single chiral edge state propagating along
the edge of the finite 2D sample [26]. As such, our 3D
model can be considered a stack of 2D QAH insulators
stacked along the z axis. Due to the additional prefactor
of τ in Eqs. (4) and (5), neighboring layers have opposite
chiralities: in layers with τ = 1 (τ = ¯1), the edge states
propagate clockwise (counterclockwise) around the finite
2D sample. Furthermore, as was shown in Ref. [26], the
strict requirement ∆B ≫ty can be relaxed as long as the
2D layers are in the topological phase characterized by
the condition ∆B > ty.
