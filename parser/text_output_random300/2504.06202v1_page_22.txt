4.4
Equivalence between different four-arm events
We start by showing the following up-to-constants estimate.
Lemma 4.11. For κ ∈(8/3, 4], we have
P(E1(ε, r)) ≲P(E2(ε, r)) ≲P(E1(2ε, r)).
Proof. We first show that P(E2(ε, r)) ≲P(E1(2ε, r)). Let Ξ be the set of loops in LD that stay in
Aε,2ε and surround Bε. Since the measure of such loops is bounded from below uniformly in ε,
there is a universal constant c > 0 such that
P(Ξ = ∅) ≤c P(Ξ ̸= ∅).
(4.14)
Note that E2(ε, r) is equivalent to E2(ε, r)(LD \ Ξ) ∩{Ξ = ∅}, where the notation E2(ε, r)(LD \ Ξ)
means that LD \ Ξ satisfies E2(ε, r). By the independence of Ξ and LD \ Ξ, we obtain that
P(E2(ε, r)) = P(E2(ε, r)(LD \ Ξ) ∩{Ξ = ∅}) = P(E2(ε, r)(LD \ Ξ)) P(Ξ = ∅).
(4.15)
Combining (4.14) with (4.15), and noting that E2(ε, r)(LD \ Ξ) ∩{Ξ ̸= ∅} implies E1(2ε, r), we have
P(E2(ε, r)) ≤c P(E2(ε, r)(LD \ Ξ)) P(Ξ ̸= ∅) ≤c P(E1(2ε, r)).
Next, we show the harder direction P(E1(ε, r)) ≲P(E2(ε, r)). The general proof idea is very
similar to the proof of locality for arm events. Hence, we will only sketch the key idea, and refer to
Section 5.2 in [13] for the corresponding details in the discrete setting. Note that there are different
cases for E1(ε, r), as shown in Figure 1.1. But all of them can be tackled in a very similar way. To
fix idea, we will focus on the middle case with C-shape, i.e., there are two pairs of crossings of the
loop γ in Aε,r that are not connected by the intersection of γ with Br. We denote this event by
EC
1 (ε, r). On the event EC
1 (ε, r), we first explore all the loops in Br to check if there are clusters
made by these loops that cross Aε,r/2. If there are at least two of them, then we end up with
E2(ε, r/2; Br). By Proposition 4.1, it is easy to see that P(E2(ε, r/2; Br)) ≲P(E2(ε, r)). Hence, we
only need to consider the following two cases, belonging to EC
1 (ε, r) \ E2(ε, r/2; Br).
• Case (1). No cluster of Lr across Aε,r/2. There are two different ways to realize the event
EC
1 (ε, r). First, assume there are two Brownian loops γ1 and γ2 crossing Ar/2,r such that each
γi contains an excursion ηi inside Br that are connected to two different clusters C1 and C2
inside Br/2, respectively, and Λ(η1 ∪C1, Lr) does not intersect η2 ∪C2. Note that we allow
γ1 and γ2 to intersect away from η1 and η2. Now, we view each excursion ηi as a pair of
Brownian paths from r/2 to r: by Lemma 4.4 with j = k = 2, we see that the ending parts of
these excursions are away from each other inside Lr. Hence, we can resample the remaining
parts of γi \ ηi for both i = 1, 2 such that they stay inside local regions around the ending
points of ηi, respectively, and the loops γ1 and γ2 after resampling are also away from each
other inside Lr. Finally, by resampling all the remaining loops in LD \ (Lr ∪{γ1, γ2}) such
that the clusters formed by them are sufficiently small, we end up with E2(ε, r). Since every
resampling procedure only costs some positive constant (independent of ε), we conclude this
case. Next, we assume that there is a Brownian loop eγ that contains two disjoint excursions
eη1 and eη2, which are connected to two clusters C1 and C2 inside Br/2 as before, and satisfy the
same condition, where the only difference is that both excursions come from the same loop.
