procedure on the 18 variable problem was found to be (0.37 ± 0.07) s. The percentage of broken chains
for minor embedding on the 18 variable QUBO was (2.6 ± 2.2)%.
Figure 19a shows the embedding time required for all problem sizes solved. Figure 19b displays the
QPU access time that the D-Wave device allocates for solving problem sizes of up to 72 variables, and
Figure 19c presents the average chain lengths used. Full results for quantum annealing using both
minor and clique embedding are shown in Table 5 for the larger problem sizes.

Figure 19: All results were repeated 10 times, with average values used, and the standard deviation included as error
bars. (a) Quantum annealing embedding time when solving the three vacancy QUBO problem at different sizes up to
128 variables. (b) Quantum annealing QPU access time when solving the three vacancy QUBO problem at different
sizes up to 128 variables. (c) Quantum annealing increase in chain length when solving the three vacancy QUBO
problem at different sizes up to 128 variables. (d) Quantum annealing increase in broken chains fraction when solving
the three vacancy QUBO problem at different sizes up to 72 variables. The broken chains fraction was unable to be
captured past a certain problem size.
