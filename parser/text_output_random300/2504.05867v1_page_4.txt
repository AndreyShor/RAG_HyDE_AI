2.2. ASAS-SN
All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-
SN; B. J. Shappee et al. (2014); C. Kochanek et al.
(2017)) is a global network of 24 telescopes that has
been continuously scanning the extragalactic sky since
2012. ASAS-SN’s limiting magnitude of V∼16.5 - 17.5
and g∼17.5 - 18.5 depending on lunation.
ASAS-SN
camera’s field of view (FOV) is 4.5 deg2, and the pixel
scale and FWHM are 8
′′.0 and ∼2 pixels, respectively.
For this study, we collected both bands’ observations
through the ASAS-SN Sky Patrol (V2.03; (B. J. Shappee
et al. 2014; K. Hart et al. 2023)).
3. PERIODICITY SEARCH
We adopted various methodologies in search of a po-
tential periodic signal in the γ-ray and optical light
curves of blazar ON 246. Figure 1 illustrates the weekly
binned γ-ray light curve along with optimal Bayesian
Block representation (top panel) and an ASAS-SN op-
tical light curve in the bottom panel.
The utilized methodologies include the Lomb-Scargle
periodogram (LSP), Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform
(WWZ), and a first-order autoregressive model (AR(1))
in this QPO investigation. A detailed description and
the observed findings from all the utilized methods are
given in the following section 3.1, 3.2.
3.1. Lomb-Scargle Periodogram
The Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) (N. R. Lomb
1976; J. D. Scargle 1979) is one of the most widely used
approaches in the literature to identify any potential pe-
riodic signal in a time series. In which a sinusoidal func-
tion fits the time series using the least square method.
This approach is capable of handling the non-uniform
sampling in the time series data efficiently by reducing
the impact of noise and gaps and providing a precise
measurement of the identified periodicity. In this study,
we used the GLSP package to compute the Lomb-Scargle
(LS) power. The expression of LS power is given as J. T.

where, we selected the minimum frequency (fmin) and
maximum frequency (fmax) in temporal frequency range
as 1/T and 1/2∆T, respectively, and here T and ∆T
represent the total observation time frame and the time
difference between two consecutive points in the light
curve, respectively.
The LSP analysis reveals prominent peaks at frequen-
cies of ∼0.00134 day−1 (746±68 days) in the γ-ray LSP
(see Figure 2) and ∼0.00132 day−1 (757 ± 106 days) in
the optical LSP (see Figure 3). Both peaks have a local
significance level exceeding 99.73%. The uncertainty on
the observed period is estimated by fitting a Gaussian
function to the dominant LSP peak, and the obtained
half-width and half maxima (HWHM) value is used as
an uncertainty on period. The distribution of LS power
as a function of frequency is given in Figure 2.
3.2. Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform
In contrast to the LSP approach, the Weighted
Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) (G. Foster 1996) emerges
as a powerful, robust, and widely used method in astro-
nomical studies to identify any potential periodic pat-
tern in irregularly sampled light curves.
The WWZ
method incorporates wavelet analysis, enhancing the
LSP’s capabilities by providing better localization of pe-
riodic signals in both temporal and spectral space. In
studying the evolution of a periodic signal over time,
this approach emerges as a powerful tool, enabling us to
identify and characterize the nature of a periodic signal.
In this study, we adopted the abbreviated Morlet ker-
nel that has the following functional form (A. Gross-
mann & J. Morlet 1984):
f[ω(t −τ)] = exp[iω(t −τ) −cω2(t −τ)2]
(3)
and the corresponding WWZ map is given by,
W[ω, τ : x(t)] = ω1/2
Z
x(t)f ∗[ω(t −τ)]dt
(4)
where, f ∗is the complex conjugate of the wavelet ker-
nel f, ω is the frequency, and τ is the time-shift. This
kernel acts as a windowed DFT, where the size of the
window is determined by both the parameters ω and a
constant c. The resulting WWZ map offers a notable
advantage; it not only identifies dominant periodicities
but also provides insights into their duration over time.
