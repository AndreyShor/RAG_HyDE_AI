Proof. Note that A := Aε ∩D is a simply connected domain. Let f be the conformal map from A
onto D that leaves a, 1 fixed. Let PA be the probability measure of an SLEκ in A from a to 1. Let
α(κ) be given by (1.1). Let ΛD(η, D \ A) be the mass of Brownian loops in D that intersect both η
and D \ A. By the restriction property of SLEκ, we have
P[η ⊂A] =
Z
1η⊂A(f′
A(a)f′
A(1))(6−κ)/(2κ) exp (−α(κ)ΛD(η, D \ A)) dPA(η).
(2.2)
Note that for κ ∈(0, 4], SLEκ a.s. does not touch the boundary of the domain (except at its
endpoints), hence ΛD(η, D \ A) < ∞for PA-a.e. η. Hence the integrand in (2.2) is positive for
PA-a.e. η, leading to a positive integral.

Two-arm events for CLE
As a warm-up, we first establish up-to-constants estimates for two-arm events in CLEκ. This case,
involving only one loop, is much easier.
Indeed, in the four-arm case, we will have to handle
interactions between different crossing loops in the CLE. We use this simple case to illustrate some
ideas which will be used again later on.
Definition 3.1 (Two-arm events for CLE). For κ ∈(8/3, 4], let Γ+ (resp. Γ) be a CLEκ in H (resp.
D). We define the boundary two-arm event A+
2 (ε, r) (resp. interior two-arm event A2(ε, r)) to be
the event that there is at least one loop γ in Γ+ (resp. Γ) that intersects both ∂Bε and ∂Br.
The goal of this section is to prove the following proposition.
Proposition 3.2. For κ ∈(8/3, 4] and r ∈(0, 1), we have the following up-to-constants estimates
for two-arm events in CLEκ, as ε →0,
P(A+
2 (ε, r)) ≍εξ+
2 (κ),
P(A2(ε, r)) ≍εξ2(κ),
where ξ+
2 (κ) and ξ2(κ) are given by (1.2), and the implicit constants depend on r, κ.
We will perform a Markovian exploration of CLEκ as in [36], in order to relate CLEκ loops to
SLEκ curves, so that we can apply Propositions 2.2 and 2.3. For this purpose, we need to restrict
ourselves to some good events. On the event A+
2 (ε, r) (resp. A2(ε, r)), there is a loop γ in Γ+
(resp. Γ) that intersects ∂Bε and ∂Br. Let G+(ε, r) (resp. G(ε, r)) be the event that all the loops
in Γ+ \ {γ} (resp. Γ \ {γ}) which intersect B2r have diameter less than r/10.
Lemma 3.3. For κ ∈(8/3, 4] and r ∈(0, 1), we have, as ε →0,
P(A+
2 (ε, r)) ≍P(A+
2 (ε, r) ∩G+(ε, r)),
P(A2(ε, r)) ≍P(A2(ε, r) ∩G(ε, r)).
The proof relies on the Brownian loop soup (BLS) representation of the CLE. We view the
events for CLEκ equivalently as events for the BLS with intensity α in the same domain, coupled
with CLEκ, where α and κ are related by (1.1). Throughout the proof, we denote by LD the
Brownian loop soup with intensity α in the domain D.
