Abstract
We explore entanglement harvesting using two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors linearly coupled to the scalar density
of a massless spin-1/2 field in 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime. We consider different vacua, including the Boulware, Hartle-
Hawking-Israel (HHI), and Unruh vacua, and investigate various configurations depending on the choice of 2-bein in the
interaction Hamiltonian. We find that the transition rate of the static UDW detector exhibits the expected Planckian
behavior in the HHI state, while the Unruh state leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a bosonic or fermionic
thermal bath corresponding to the static or conformal 2-bein respectively. Further, we observe that the anti-Hawking
effect enhances the entanglement between the two detectors while the gravitational redshift and Hawking radiation
decreases it. In particular, due to the presence of the anti-Hawking effect, the mutual information and concurrence
near the event horizon can be non-zero even for static detectors with static 2-bein, which is in contrast with the case
of scalar field. We also show that the near-horizon entanglement properties for static detectors in the HHI state have
similar behaviour with those in Minkowski vacua for uniformly accelerated detectors in Rindler spacetime. Conclusions
are discussed.
