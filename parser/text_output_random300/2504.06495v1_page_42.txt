The Born rule becomes crucial in this context, as it ensures that the probability distribu-
tion of measurement outcomes preserves these conservation laws in expectation — and thus
macroscopically.
Thus, even a slight deviation from the Born rule may lead to observable macroscopic
violations of conservation laws. Our framework is designed to guarantee a very good approx-
imation to the Born rule at macroscopic scales, so conservation laws remain eﬀectively intact.
Nevertheless, our derivations also point to possible deviations from the Born rule (e.g., the
coeﬃcient β may not be exactly one, and in our discrete time framework we require a small
ǫ approximation). There might also be special physical circumstances (some of which are
discussed below) where the assumptions for our derivation of the Born rule could be violated.
Violation of the Born rule during the early universe
It is plausible to conjecture that the universe began in a simple, coherent quantum state, and
that the full branching structure of the multiverse only emerged gradually. In particular, the
threshold behavior ξt = ǫ αt was derived in Section 5 as a steady-state property, and before
steady-state was reached, the truncation threshold likely followed a diﬀerent trajectory.
Thus, during this initial phase of branching, truncation may have been minimal or ab-
sent, implying that the Born rule would have been signiﬁcantly violated. Since the Born rule
underpins the regularity of physical laws at macroscopic scales (see our discussion of “con-
servation laws” above), this transition period to the steady state would likely have appeared
highly irregular from the perspective of standard physics. It is natural to ask whether early-
universe phenomena — such as cosmological inﬂation — may be related to this convergence
toward quantum statistical equilibrium.
Localized branching in relativistic contexts
In a relativistic context, one may question whether the Schr¨odinger equation — and the
branching dynamics it governs — remains valid across all of spacetime (see, e.g. Penrose
2006). It is plausible that quantum evolution is only well-deﬁned within local regions where
spacetime geometry is approximately classical and stable.
