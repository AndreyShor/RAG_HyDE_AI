FIG. 8. Simulation results for the ground-state energy across varying noise amplification factors c, with transverse field intensity fixed at
J = 0.5. Panel (a) corresponds to a 2-spin system, (b) to a 3-spin system, and (c) to a 4-spin system. The blue dots represent the optimized
ground-state energy for c values ranging from 0.0 to 2.0. The first-order extrapolations (red solid lines) are based on the data points for c = 1.0
and c = 2.0. The second-order extrapolations (green solid lines) utilize the data points for c values including 1.0, 1.2, ..., up to 2.0.
curacy of quantum operations and the stability of results over
time. We monitor the coherence of the transmon qubit over
time. Figure 7 tracks T1 of the transmon qubit without the
controlled damping as a reference, comparing it to the reduced
T1 values for each Fock state. Over a period of 16 hours,
the system exhibits small drift, with the intrinsic T1 increas-
ing from 20 µs to 25 µs, while the reduced T1 also shows a
slight increase. Although the ratio between them does not re-
main perfectly constant, the method demonstrates reasonable
robustness. Furthermore, in this experiment, we implement
a fast initialization method on the storage cavity to improve
the reliability of error mitigation and reduce susceptibility to
coherence variations.

NUMERICAL SIMULATION
We perform numerical simulations that replicate the ex-
perimental sequence using experimentally calibrated Hamil-
tonian parameters. We iterate the entire process 200 times
using the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation
algorithm [11, 39] and compare the results with our experi-
mental data. The optimized ground state energies are calcu-
lated for systems with varying spin numbers (N = 2,3,4) at a
fixed transverse field intensity of J = 0.5, considering differ-
ent noise amplification factors c, as shown in Fig. 8.
A second-order polynomial fit is conducted on the simu-
lated data across noise amplification factors c ranging from
1.0 to 2.0, yielding an extrapolated value that closely approx-
imates the simulated zero-noise energy. In accordance with
the experimental procedure, a first-order extrapolation is also
performed on the simulated data. The discrepancy observed
between the first-order extrapolated results and the simulated
zero-noise energy highlights the impact of higher-order noise
effects.
This observation underscores the need for higher-
order extrapolation methods to achieve more accurate noise
mitigation in quantum simulations.
