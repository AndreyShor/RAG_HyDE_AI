3 Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6
The HEA, composed of refractory elements, is commonly known as the Senkov alloy.
The Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti Senkov alloy, exhibiting a single bcc structure, has garnered
signiﬁcant attention due to its exceptional room-temperature tensile ductility[69].
This property may be advantageous for the fabrication of superconducting wires.
Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti is a well-studied superconducting HEA, and the cocktail eﬀect of
Tc and the robust superconductivity against high pressure or irradiation distinguish
Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti from conventional alloys.
The Jc characteristics of Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 have been extensively studied
by the research teams at Kyung Hee University and Sungkyunkwan University. Read-
ers are encouraged to refer to the comprehensive review[70], which partially discusses
the Jc results of Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6.
3.1 As-cast bulk sample prepared by arc-melting technique
The ﬁrst report on the Jc of Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 was published in 2020[71]. This
HEA with a single-phase structure was synthesized using a conventional arc-melting
technique, and the superconducting properties of the as-cast state were evaluated.
The fundamental superconducting properties were characterized through measure-
ments of magnetization, electrical resistivity, and speciﬁc heat. The HEA undergoes a
superconducting transition at 7.85 K. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the
upper critical ﬁeld suggests a µ0Hc2(0) of 12.05 T, from which the zero-temperature
Ginzburg–Landau coherence length, ξGL(0), is calculated to be 5.23 nm.
Figure 2 displays the magnetic hysteresis loops measured at temperatures ranging
from 2 to 7 K. Figure 3(a) presents the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of Jc measured
between 2 and 5 K. All Jc data demonstrate the conventional trend of decreasing Jc
with increasing magnetic ﬁeld. Jc systematically increases across the entire magnetic
