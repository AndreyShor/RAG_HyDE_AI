by removing the terms defined in equation 10 from the Hamiltonian 8. In the latter case, the term ˜R in equation
31 is zero and the relation 33 is exact. We note that, for each pair of eigenstates, the faster they decay, the smaller
the difference between the red and the blue curves: they are indistinguishable for each superposition except for the
two with longer coherence times. By considering the discussion made in section IV C, this is exactly what we expect:
the more the differences between the expectation values of the spin operator become small (∆parameter decrease),
the more the coherence times become longer and the second order terms non-negligible because comparable with the
leading terms.
Figure 7: For the system described in section V B, we report the curves associated with a set of eigenstates: in blue,
the one showed in figure 4, in red these eigenstates are computed by removing the terms 10 from the Hamiltonian.

Expectation values of spin operators for qudit proposal
In the following figures (8,9,10), we report the expectation values of the local spin operators for the qudit proposal
defined in section V C. In the legend of each figure, we show the label of the chosen eigenstates.
