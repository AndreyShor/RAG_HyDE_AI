tensor shapes that are too small results in incorrect computations, as non-zero elements need to be dropped.
To dynamically adjust to the current wave function and avoid an abundance of compilations, we compute
the necessary tensor shapes to execute this step at every call. In particular, we log the numbers of electron-
nuclei edges, electron-electron edges, affected electrons in single-electron moves (local and global), electrons
close to pseudopotentials, and the triplets in Eq. (45). In subsequent steps, we use these as lower bounds with
some padding as tensor shapes and pad the necessary tensors to fixed shapes, avoiding recompilation for every
possible neighborhood combination. This way, the first call may be numerically incorrect due to non-aligned
tensor shapes, but subsequent calls minimize the amount of padding while maintaining exact computation.
Laplacian computations were done with folx [13].

Theoretical VMC convergence rates
Recent work [14, 15] has investigated theoretical convergence bounds for NN-VMC in conjunction with MCMC-
based SGD methods. The theoretically established convergence rates are α = 1/4 for convergence to a first-order
stationary point [14, Corollary 4.4] and α = 2/11 for convergence to an approximate second-order stationary
or a low-variance point [15, Theorem 3]. While the polynomial nature of these convergence results is consistent
with our empirical findings, our empirical rate of α = 1 is considerably higher than the rates suggested by
theory. Potential reasons for this discrepancy could be our use of preconditioning during optimization or the
fact that the variance of the sampling distribution tends to zero as an eigenvector is approached, thereby
improving the sampling complexity. We also mention that under additional assumptions (most importantly a
Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition), an optimal rate α = 1 can be established for standard SGD-type methods [16].
While this rate would match our empirical findings, it is unclear if a Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition holds in our
setting. Furthermore, the results of [14, 15] are not directly applicable to our setting because they monitor the
loss gradient instead of the energy error and also rely on certain boundedness/mixing assumptions that may
not be satisfied in our case. A more comprehensive analysis would be highly desirable but lies beyond the scope
of this work.

Conventional quantum chemistry calculations
All conventional calculations were performed using ORCA 6.0.1 [17] using correlation consistent basis cc-pVXZ
sets by Dunning [18] for CCSD(T) calculations and def2-XVP basis sets for DFT calculations. We extrapolate
results to the complete basis set (CBS) limit by extrapolating the Hartree-Fock energy from calculations at
the triple- and quadruple-zeta levels. The correlation energy is extrapolated from calculations performed at
the double- and triple-zeta levels, where affordable. Calculations denoted as DZ correspond to Hartree-Fock
energy at the CBS level and correlation energy obtained at the double-zeta level. For basis set extrapolation,
we use the relationships published by Neese et al. [19]. For DFT calculations, we use the PBE0 [20] exchange-
correlation-functional with the D3BJ dispersion correction [21]. ZPVE for the benzene dimer at the MP2-level
were taken from [22]; for chloroferrocene, we calculated them at the PBE0/D3BJ level. Subtracting them from
