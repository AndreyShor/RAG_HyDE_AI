Furthermore, in (1 + 1) dimensions, the electric ﬁeld has no independent degrees of freedom.
For charged particles moving within a ﬁnite region (|x| < L), the electric ﬁeld in an outer
region (|x| > L) is E = ± 1
2 ∑a ea. E = 0 in the outer region for a system of zero total charge.
The canonical reduction of this system proceeds in a manner similar to the uncharged
case. The coordinate conditions (21) can again be chosen and the reduced action is still given
by (22). The reduced Hamiltonian is again given by (23), but now the constraints become

The consistency of this canonical reduction is proven by showing that the canonical
equations of motion derived from the reduced Hamiltonian (23) are identical with the
Equations (55) and (56) [99,105].
5. The Two-Body Problem
As stated in the introduction, an exact solution to the two-body problem is known in
Newtonian theory, but not in general relativity due to the dissipation of energy in the form
of gravitational radiation. Hence, an analysis of a two-body system in general relativity
(e.g., binary pulsars) necessarily involves resorting to approximation methods such as
a post-Newtonian expansion [100,106]. Quite remarkably, there are a number of exact
solutions [104,105,107–109] to the two-body problem in the ROGS theory described above.
While this is in part understandable due to the lack of gravitational radiation (there are no
gravitons in (1 + 1) dimensions), the nonlinearity of the system does not obviously admit
exact solutions, and in fact, a general dilaton theory of gravity will not have them.
5.1. Solution for Two Charged Particles
Here, we present the exact solution for the charged case [105], since from it, the
electrically neutral case is recovered by setting e1 = e2 = 0. The standard approach for
obtaining a solution is to ﬁnd an explicit expression for the Hamiltonian (23) by solving (63)
and (64). From this, the equations of motion can be derived, which in turn, can be solved to
obtain the trajectories of the particles.
Noting that the electric ﬁeld appears in the combination (E2 + 2Λ/κ) in all equations,
it is convenient to set
V(x) ≡E2 −C
and
Λe ≡−2Λ −κC
(65)
with C ≡1
4(∑a ea)2. The quantity Λe is an effective cosmological constant that includes
the contribution from the electric ﬁeld. This situation arises because, analogous to the
way in which a four-form behaves in (3 + 1) dimensions [110], in (1 + 1) dimensions, the
electromagnetic ﬁeld strength is a two-form, and so contributes to the stress–energy tensor
in the same manner as a cosmological constant in compact spatial regions.
