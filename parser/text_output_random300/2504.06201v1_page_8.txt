Benchmarking Problems 
Real-world problems 
Material optimization is selected to represent real-world problems, with the design of planar 
multilayers (PMLs) optical film as a testbed for benchmarking. PMLs can be seen in many 
applications. For example, they have been explored for transparent radiative cooling windows to 
address global warming by emitting thermal radiation through the atmospheric window (8 μm < λ 
< 13 μm) 4, while transmitting visible photons. PMLs consist of layers with one of four dielectric 
materials: silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, and titanium dioxide. The configuration 
of these layers can be expressed as a binary vector, where each layer is assigned a two-digit binary 
label. Optical characteristics and corresponding figure-of-merit (FOM) of the PML can be 
calculated by solving Maxwell's equations using the transfer matrix method (TMM). To formulate 
QUBOs, layer configurations (input binary vectors) and their FOMs (outputs) are used to train the 
FM model. FM learns the linear and quadratic coefficients, effectively modeling the optimization 
landscape of the material system. QUBO matrices are then generated using these coefficients30,31. 
PML configurations are randomly generated for training datasets, and their FOMs are calculated 
using TMM. The resulting QUBO matrices represent real-world materials optimization problems, 
characterized by highly dense (fully connected) configurations (Fig. S1), which are used for the 
benchmarking study in Fig. 1. 
 
Benchmarking problems 
We formulate QUBO matrices with random elements to further systematically explore scalability 
(Fig. 2 and Fig. 3), following the characteristics of QUBOs from real-world problems, for the 
benchmarking study as the following:  
• Problem size: The problem size, corresponding to the length of a binary vector (𝑛), varies from 
120 to 10,000 (120, 200, 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 
9,000 and 10,000).  
• Distribution of elements: For each problem size, four QUBO matrices with different distributions 
of elements are studied. These elements are random numbers with a mean value of 0 and standard 
deviations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, or 1. These distributions reflect the variability observed in QUBO 
coefficients derived from real-world problems (Table S1). A QUBO configured with elements 
having a large deviation yields a significant variation in the energy landscape, potentially resulting 
in high energy barriers that must be overcome to find the ground state.  
• Density of matrices: The density of QUBO matrices reflects the proportion of pairwise 
interactions among variables relative to the maximum possible interactions. Fully connected 
QUBOs, such as those derived from real-world problems, represent cases where all variables 
interact with each other. For example, in layered photonic structures, each layer interacts with 
every other layer, influencing optical responses, which leads to a fully connected QUBO. In 
contrast, Max-Cut problems typically result in sparse QUBOs, where only a subset of variables 
(nodes) interact through edges. The maximum number of interaction coefficients (i.e., the 
number of edges in Max-Cut problems) is nC2, where n denotes the problem size. The density of 
a QUBO can be calculated as:  
 
 
density = 
number of interaction coefficients
maximum number of interaction coefficients
