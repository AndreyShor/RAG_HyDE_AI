The Regge pole and the Regge cuts in the amplitudes at NNLL
The factorised expression of eq. (2.15) is dictated by the exchange of a reggeized gluon in
the t-channel [2, 31, 75, 117–121] and is expected to break down at NNLL accuracy, due
to the contribution of Regge cuts [40]. In general, the amplitudes take the form

At NNLL the equation above requires the terms of O(α2
s) in the expansion of the impact
factors, eqs. (2.22) and (2.25), as well as the coeﬃcients up to O(α3
s) of the gluon Regge
trajectory, eq. (2.16). In order to make use of eq. (2.30), we need a prescription [42, 44,
47, 77, 78, 81] to disentangle the contribution of the reggeized gluon from the Regge cut
