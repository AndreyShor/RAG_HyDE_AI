spin-channel asymmetry originates from the spin-dependent effective potential 
created by the e-e interaction in a disordered background. 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 5. Transmission probabilities, 𝑇↑ and 𝑇↓, for up and down spin electrons, together with the 
spin polarization coefficient as a function of energy, for a 30-site AAH chain under different 
values of e-e and e-ph interaction strengths. Here we choose W=1. 
The disparity between the spin-resolved energy levels becomes even more 
pronounced when e-ph coupling is incorporated alongside the e-e interaction, as 
shown in Fig. 4(c). The additional presence of e-ph coupling further distorts the 
system, enhancing the symmetry breaking between the up-spin and down-spin sub-
Hamiltonians. Furthermore, an overall narrowing of the energy bands is observed, 
which can be attributed to the renormalization effects induced by the electron-phonon 
interaction. The combined influence of e-e and e-ph interactions in a disordered 
setting thus leads to a significant restructuring of the energy spectra compared to the 
non-interacting case. 
Figure 5 presents the characteristic behavior of spin-dependent transmission prob-
abilities along with the spin polarization coefficient as a function of energy for the 
AAH chain, analyzed under different conditions involving e-e and e-ph interactions.
