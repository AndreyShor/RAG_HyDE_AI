tron density and interlayer Kondo coupling (or orbital
hybridization) can be smoothly tuned in a controllable
manner [26–28]. The similar heterostructure with trian-
gular lattices was previously realized in 3He ﬁlms [29, 30]
where some experimental features including the density-
driven Mottness and the eﬀective mass enhancement
[31, 32] were interpreted as due to an orbital-selective
Mott transition or a Kondo breakdown [32–34]. Another
experimental platform is the densely f electron interca-
lated graphene bilayers. This f-electron heterostructure
can be realized using the molecular beam epitaxy tech-
nique, and some characteristic Kondo lattice features in-
cluding the low Hubbard and 4f quasiparticle ﬂat bands
below or around the Fermi level have been evidenced re-
cently [35, 36].
Motivated by these advances, we here consider a het-
erostructure composed of an localized f-electron honey-
comb lattice stacked by the itinerant c-electron graphene.
We assume that the f-monolayer is ﬁxed, while the c-
monolayer can slide along a given direction, chosen as
the armchair direction connecting the high and low sym-
metry conﬁgurations [37][38, 39]. The generic stacking
conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 1. Recall that in the ho-
mobilayer graphene the sliding process does not dramati-
cally change the band structure[40, 41], while twisting the
bilayer would result in the occurrence of ﬂat bands and
rich correlated quantum phases[42–44]. So far the eﬀect
of the sliding process has been intensively investigated in
connection with the stacking-engineered ferroelectricity
in the two-dimensional van der Waals materials [45–48],
while its interplay with the strong electron correlation
is less explored. In the following, we shall ﬁnd that the
sliding process (without twisting) in the present corre-
lated heterostructure allows to tune the selectivity of the
multiorbital KS which is delicately sensitive to the inver-
sion symmetry breaking. The resultant unconventional
ﬂat hybridizing band adds a new ingredient to the broad
context of Kondo physics.

being distinguished by the blue and green circles. tc denotes
the c-electron intralayer nearest-neighbor hopping. V1 and V2
denote two representative interlayer hybridizations. (b) Top

the x-axis. ⃗a1 and ⃗a2 are the lattice vectors.

MODEL HAMILTONIAN
We start from the model Hamiltonian which consists
of three parts:
ˆH = ˆHc + ˆHf + ˆHcf.
(1)
The ﬁrst part describes the conduction (c) monolayer:
ˆHc = −
X
⟨ij⟩σ
[t(c)
ij ˆc†
⃗riσˆc⃗rjσ + H.c.],
(2)
with ˆc⃗riσ being the annihilation operator of conduction
electrons, σ =↑, ↓the spin degrees of freedom, and t(c)
ij
the hopping matrix. The subscript i or j labels the sites
on the honeycomb lattice, ⃗ri is the position vector in
this monolayer.
Reproducing the essential features of
the Dirac semimetal bath allows to assume the nonzero
intralayer hopping parameter t(c)
ij = tc > 0 for the nearest
neighbor sites only. Similarly, the second part describes
the f-monolayer:
ˆHf = −

tion vector in this monolayer. Here, a nearest neighbor
hopping energy t(f)

= tf for f electrons is introduced
without losing the generality. In the realistic situation,
|tf/tc| is very small and we shall take tf = 0 in most cal-
culations, together with the occupation energy E0 < 0
and the on-site Coulomb interaction U →∞. Namely,
this monolayer is assumed in the Mott phase at half ﬁll-
ing in the absence of hybridization. The third part is the
interlayer hybridization term:

with Vij being the generic interlayer hybridization matrix
elements.
There are two favorable stacking conﬁgurations as
in the bilayer graphene[40, 41]: the A-A and A-B (or
Bernal) patterns with the C6 and C3 symmetries, respec-
tively. The sliding process considered here smoothly in-
terpolates these patterns with the reﬂection symmetry
Mx. In each monolayer the location of the j-th site can
be assigned by j = (n, η), with n = (n1, n2) being a
pair of integers labelling the unit cells and η = A, B
the even or odd sublattices, respectively. The f-layer is
ﬁxed in the z = 0 plane, so ⃗Rj = n1⃗a1 + n2⃗a2 + a0
