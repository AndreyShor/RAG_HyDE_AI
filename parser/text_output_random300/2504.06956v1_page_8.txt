Theorem A. For each λ > 0, there exists a continuous random field eΥλ on Rd such that, for any
function F ∈Cb
loc(C(Rd)), one has
E[F(eΥλ)] = lim
b→∞E[F(Υb) | M0,b(Υb) ≤λ] = lim
b→∞E[F(Υ∞) | M0,b(Υ∞) ≤λ] .
(2.5)
We emphasise that the existence of the weak limits in (2.5) is part of the statement. We also observe
that the conditioning on the right-hand side of (2.5) is singular as b →∞. More precisely, by letting
α
def=
√
2/π ,
we have the following result.
Theorem B. For each λ > 0, there exists a constant c⋆,λ > 0, such that
lim
b→∞
√
b P(M0,b(Υ∞) ≤λ) = α c⋆,λ .
Remark 2.5. In Section 4, we introduce a characterisation of the field Φb in terms of a stochastic
integral driven by a one-dimensional Brownian motion (Bt)t≥0 (as a cartoon, think of this as being
a smoothened out version of the field x 7→−Blog |x|), plus an independent centred Gaussian field,
see (4.1). In particular, we will prove a stronger version of Theorems A and B, where we also
allow conditioning on the value of B at time b. We refer to Propositions 4.1 and 4.2 for the precise
statements.
Remark 2.6. Although we don’t have an explicit representation for the constant c⋆,λ, we will see in
(4.44) below that it is given by
c⋆,λ = lim
k→∞E[Bk1{Bk∈[k1/6,k5/6]}1{M0,k(Υk)≤λ}] ,
(2.6)
with B and Υk related as in Remark 2.5. The exponents 1/6 and 5/6 appearing here are of course
unimportant and could probably be replaced by any values in (0, 1/2) and (1/2, ∞) respectively. We
refer to Lemma 4.18 for a proof of the fact that c⋆,λ ∈(0, ∞).
We recall that the introduction of a threshold λ > 0 in Theorems A and B is necessary due to the
continuous setting in which we are working. In such a context, conditioning on the event that a
field, which is zero at the origin, remains negative is ill-posed. However, it is desirable to define
a “canonical” field that captures the local structure of X around an extremal point, without being
arbitrarily dependent on λ.
To achieve this, we introduce below a field Ψλ, which is essentially just eΥλ shifted to move its
maximum to the origin, but under a slightly tilted law. At first glance, it may seem contradictory to
define a field that we claim is independent of λ while still denoting it as Ψλ. This notation arises
because, from its definition, it is not immediately evident that Ψλ is indeed independent of the
threshold λ. However, this independence (albeit in a slightly weaker sense) will be established a
posteriori (see Proposition 2.13).
Before defining the field Ψλ, for all x ∈Rd, we introduce the shift operator τx : C(Rd) →C(Rd) by
τxf(·) = f(· + x) −f(x) ,
∀f ∈C(Rd) .
(2.7)
Furthermore, we let Λ ⊆R+ denote the uncountable set introduced in Lemma 5.1 below. Roughly
speaking, Λ consists of the “good thresholds” λ for which the law of the field eΥλ exhibits some desirable
properties. More precisely, these bad values are those values of λ such that P(supx∈Rd eΥλ(x) = λ) > 0
or P(|{y ∈Rd : eΥλ(y) = supx∈Rd eΥλ(x) −λ}| > 0) > 0 where |·| denotes Lebesgue measure. We
emphasise that we don’t expect any such bad values to exist, i.e., we expect that Λ = R+. However,
