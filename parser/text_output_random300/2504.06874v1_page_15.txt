by the white dashed line in Fig. 4c is not fully reverted to its initial position (indicated 
by the blue dashed line in Fig. 4b). It is possibly due to the DW pinning at ends and 
slight mismatch between the two scanning areas in Figs. 4b&4c.  
 
Discussion 
Theoretical studies have predicted vertical polarizations in tetralayer graphene to be at 
least an order of magnitude smaller than those in binary 2D semiconductors such as 
twisted hBN and MoS‚ÇÇ moir√© superlattices, posing challenges for conventional 
detection methods [39]. Our work directly addresses this limitation by demonstrating 
that gate-tunable SNOM enables nanoscale resolution mapping of opposite out-of-
plane polarizations in carbon-based 2D metals. This advancement establishes SNOM 
as the first optical technique capable of directly probing symmetry-broken polar states 
in graphitic systems. Beyond the technological leap, our spatially- resolved 
measurements reveal that the sliding of DWs at distinct interfaces governs polarization 
switching in 2D metals, a microscopic process inaccessible to earlier techniques. The 
direct visualization of the sliding mechanism in polar states switching and versatile DW 
sliding at distinct interfaces in tetralayer graphene also significantly enhance our 
knowledge on phase transitions between different stackings in graphitic polytypes with 
more than three layers, which was only conceptualized but not experimentally 
investigated. We also emphasize that the observed optical contrast between two 
adjacent polar stackings sustains, at least, up to the charge density of about 
5 √ó 1012 ùëêùëêùëêùëê‚àí2 (Fig. 2i). It means that the electric polarizations and a large number of 
free carriers can coexist in tetralayer graphene, which is rarely observed in conventional 
ferroelectrics [59, 60]. A similar consequence was also implied in the recent KPFM 
study, but at much lower carrier density [37]. More experimental and theoretical studies 
are needed to explore the effect of free carrier doping on the spontaneous electric 
polarizations in tetralayer graphene in the future. 
 
In conclusion, we demonstrate a direct optical visualization of spontaneous 
electric polarizations in 2D elemental metal composed of entirely carbon for the first
