and taking [L] = 1 (non-dimensional height of the domain), the new scales can be
written as:
[t] =

r1/2Ra1/4 ,
[L] = 1,
[B] = rRa1/2,
[U] = [L]
[t] = r1/2Ra1/4.

Note that the (instability) timescale decreases with r and Ra, and the velocity and
buoyancy scales increase with r and Ra. After some algebra, the rescaled momentum
equation can be written as:

Dˆt = −∇ˆϕ + ˆbk +

where the Radiative Rainy number is defined as,
RyR ≡r2/3Ra.

Critical Rainy number (left) and critical Radiative Rainy number (right). Both Rainy numbers
are based on different quantifications of conditional instability, and show a degree of proportionality.
