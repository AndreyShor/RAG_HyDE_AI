ABSTRACT 
Hot carrier solar cells (HCSCs), harvesting excess energy of the hot carriers generated 
by above-band-gap photoexcitation, is crucial for pushing the solar cell efficiency 
beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit, which is challenging to realize mainly due to fast 
hot-carrier cooling. By performing transient reflectance spectroscopy in a 
MoSe2/hBN/WS2 junction, we demonstrate the gate-tunable harvest of hot electrons 
from MoSe2 to WS2. By spectrally distinguishing hot-electron extraction from lattice 
temperature increase, we find that electrostatically doped electrons in MoSe2 can boost 
hot-electron extraction density (𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸) by factor up to several tens. Such enhancement 
arises from interaction between hot excitons and doped electrons, which converts the 
excess energy of hot excitons to excitations of the Fermi sea and hence generates hot 
electrons. Moreover, 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 can be further enhanced by reducing the conduction band 
offset with external electric field. Our results provide in-depth insights into design of 
HCSCs with electrostatic strategies.
