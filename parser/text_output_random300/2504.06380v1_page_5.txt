requirement for further studies in these layered van der Waals platforms.
For our study, we have fabricated a dual-gated hBN encapsulated twisted bilayer graphene
device using the modified ‘cut and stack’24–26 technique from an exfoliated single monolayer
graphene flake on a SiO2/Si substrate. The dual-gated device structure helps to tune the
number density, n, and the perpendicular displacement field, D, independently (see Sup-
plementary Information SI- 8 ) in our TBG device. Figure. 1a shows a schematic of the
measurement scheme to measure longitudinal (Rxx) and transverse (Rxy) resistance in a
standard Hall-bar geometry setup. We measured low-temperature transport in a cryo-free
dilution refrigerator at ∼20−25 mK. The four-probe longitudinal (Vxx) and transverse volt-
age (Vxy) were measured using a lock-in amplifier at a low frequency (∼13 Hz). Measured
Rxx in Figure. 1c shows the appearance of the superconducting phase between filling factor,
ν(≡4n/ns) ≈2 −3. We have applied a parallel magnetic field, B|| (see Figure. 1b and
SI- 1), to study the hysteresis behavior in resistance with magnetic field sweep direction in
presence of external tuning knobs like n, T in our TBG device.
We have measured Rxx at different ν values at zero D by sweeping the in-plane magnetic
field, B||, within the range of ±300 mT. For the hysteresis experiment for a given ν; B||
is swept continuously from +300 mT to −300 mT, which we define as the ‘forward (FW)’
sweep and then back again from −300 mT to +300 mT defined as the ‘backward (BW)’
sweep. The reduced magnetoresistance (rMR) is defined as:
∆Rxx = RFW
xx (+B|| →−B||) −RBW
xx (−B|| →+B||)
