Let p(τ, x, y) denote the transition density of the process killed upon hitting the absorbing
boundary at x = c. Then, following Karlin and Taylor (1981), the transition density12 admits

where {λn} are the eigenvalues of −L (with 0 < λ0 < λ1 < · · ·) and {ϕn} are the correspond-

Deﬁne the survival probability:
q(τ, x) := Px(T > τ),
where T = inf{τ ≥0 : X(τ) = c} is the ﬁrst hitting time of the absorbing boundary, and
Px denotes the probability law for the process starting from X(0) = x. From the spectral
representation, it follows that for large τ, the survival probability decays exponentially:
q(τ, x) ∼ϕ0(x)e−λ0τ,
as τ →∞,

where ϕ0 is the eigenfunction corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue λ0. In particular, the
ratio of survival probabilities from two initial positions xa, xb > c satisﬁes:

In our speciﬁc setting, the process has constant drift −µ, constant variance σ2, and the
absorbing barrier is located at x = log(ǫ). The eigenfunction ϕ0 solves the second-order

a weighting function that arises in the spectral theory of one-dimensional diﬀusions. It ensures that the
generator of the diﬀusion is self-adjoint in the corresponding L2(m) space, and that the eigenfunctions ϕn(x)
form an orthonormal basis.
For a diﬀusion with constant drift −µ and constant variance σ2, the speed
measure is m(x) =
