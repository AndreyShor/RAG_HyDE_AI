mological evolution progresses and the fluctuation crosses the horizon, the fluctuation begins
to disperse into the FLRW background without black hole formation. This is evident from
the evolution of the compaction function, which decreases, and the mass excess disperses.
Similarly, the peak value of the energy density increases to a maximum before decreasing at
later times. This behaviour is accompanied by a positive Eulerian velocity U at sufficiently
late times. Qualitatively, this behaviour is similar to that observed for fluctuations below
the threshold for type-I fluctuations (see [17] for comparison).
In Fig.5 we show some snapshots of the Hamiltonian constraint (top panels) and its
averaged value (bottom panels) for the three cases previously considered. As can be observed,
the Hamiltonian constraint is satisfied during the numerical evolution.

Thresholds for type A/B PBH
Using a bisection method, we can determine the threshold for black hole formation as well
as the threshold that distinguishes type A and type B PBHs. First, to obtain the threshold
for black hole formation for type A PBHs, we follow the procedure outlined in [17], which
involves checking the peak value of the compaction function. Additionally, we also compute
the expansion of the congruences Θ± to identify and crosscheck the formation of trapped
surfaces. If the peak value of the compaction function continuously decreases over time, it
indicates that the fluctuation is dispersing into the FLRW background. Conversely, if the
