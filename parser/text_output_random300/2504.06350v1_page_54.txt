by estimating the CHSH inequality. Moreover, the witness I3 can be used to distinguish between bits
and qubits. If the dimension witness W satisfy the following condition
Cd < W ≤Qd,
(153)
where Cd and Qd are the classical and quantum bounds respectively, for dim HA = d. Specifically, suppose
Alice’s device creates d–dimensional quantum systems, a value W > Cd means that it becomes infeasible
to replicate the quantum data table using d–dimensional classical systems, or equivalently quantum states
emitted by Alice’s device that are orthogonal to Bob’s measurements. The inability to replicate the data
table using d–dimensional classical systems, witnessed by W > Cd, confirms that Eve cannot access the
full information about the system. Relaxing the assumption on the dimension would enable Eve to use
a classical system with sufficient higher dimensions to reproduce such a table.
To prove the security of SDI-QKD in
[94], following the geometrical method in [58], the authors
utilize a dimensional witness as the main tool to assess the security of SDI-QKD. Consider that Alice’s
device prepares qubits and is limited to four specific preparations (N = 4), denoted by two bits, a0
and a1, while Bob’s device can perform two binary measurements, and they can evaluate the correlators
Ea0a1,y. They can evaluate a dimension witness of the form
S = E00,0 + E00,1 + E01,0 −E01,1 −E10,0 + E10,1 −E11,0 −E11,1 ≤2.
(154)
Applying this dimension witness to the states and measurements of the BB84 protocol yields S = 2,
demonstrating the insecurity of the BB84 scheme. However, this conclusion is not limited to BB84, and
in fact any protocol that utilizes the same states and measurements as BB84, such as the SARG protocol
[301], is also insecure when viewed from this perspective. Rather, to obtain a positive key rate in the SDI
scenario, Bob must perform measurements in a basis that is rotated with respect to the BB84 bases, as
will be discussed below.
Security of SDI-QKD. A secret key can be extracted if a positive value for the key rate r = I(A :
B) −I(A : E) is obtained, where I(A : X) = P
j 1 −h(PX(ayj)) represents the mutual information.
Consequently, the sufficient condition for security is expressed as follows:
I(A : B) > I(A : E) =⇒PB > PE,
where PX = 1
2(pX(a0) + pX(a1)) denotes the average probability of party X correctly guessing when
Alice sends the state ρa0a1, based on the two random bits a0 and a1 that she generates. By evaluating
Bob’s success probability, it can be established that PB is a function of S as given by:
PB = S + 4

.
Now, consider the following scenario: Alice receives an n-bit string as input, and Bob is tasked with
guessing the value of a function from the set {Fn}n (where {Fn}n represents all Boolean functions on
n-bit strings) after receiving s qubits from Alice. The average probability of Bob’s success is bounded
above by:
Pn ≤1

.
For n = 2, the optimal probability of guessing a function Fn or its negation is equivalent. Thus, when
Alice sends a single qubit to Bob (s = 1), we have:
PB(a0) + PB(a1) + PB(a0 ⊕a1) ≤3

,
which also holds when Bob collaborates with Eve. By utilizing the relationships PBE(ai) ≥PB(ai) and
PBE(ai) ≥PE(ai), along with the inequality:
PBE(a0 ⊕a1) ≥PBE(a0, a1) ≥PBE(a0) + PBE(a1) −1,
one can derive the following equation:
PBE(a0) + PBE(a1) + PBE(a0 ⊕a1) ≥2PB(a0) + 2PE(a1) −1.
