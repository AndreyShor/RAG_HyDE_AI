1. Introduction 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), originally called electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA)[1], is today 
among the most widely used analytical methods in many areas of the natural sciences. More than 10,000 publications 
containing XPS data are published annually.[1][3] Since the inelastic mean free path 𝜆 of electrons is in the range of only 
a few nanometers, it is primarily used to analyze surface chemistry, including elemental composition, chemical states, 
and within its information depth also depth distribution.[4][5] 
A variety of methodologies have been utilized to derive depth information from XPS data. One such method involves 
the incremental surface ablation by ion etching. However, this method’s depth resolution is limited, because of 
uncertainty of ablation rates, preferential sputtering, alterations of chemical states and intermixing perpendicular to 
the surface.[6][7][8] Non-destructive approaches to extract depth-information from XPS spectra are based purely on data 
modeling, leveraging relative signal intensities and known (i.e. calculable) depth distribution functions 𝜑(𝑧), which 
represent the likelihood that an electron originates from a specific depth 𝑧 beneath the surface.[9] The nominal 
thickness 𝑑 of a single overlayer can be calculated from the measured intensity ratio 𝐼𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟: 𝐼𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 determined 
from the most intense emission peak(s) in a single fixed-angle spectrum (Figure 1).[10][11] This widely used method will 
be referred to as the single-energy-model, as it is usually relying on only a single intensity ratio with a specific 𝜑(𝑧). 
When the layers consist of different elements, the most intense peak per element is used together with its relative 
sensitivity factor (RSF).[12] When the layers are from the same element in different chemical states, like in native oxide 
layers, peak fitting can be used to distinguish signal components within a peak region without the need for RSFs (Figure 
1).[13]

overlayer (blue) with a thickness 𝑑 and interface sharpness 𝑘. The depth distribution function 𝜑(𝑧) is illustrated as red bars. 
As the emission angle increases, surface sensitivity and overlayer-to-bulk signal ratio increases. 
Angular-resolved XPS (ARXPS) can be used to obtain multiple intensity ratios from the same sample, since 𝜑(𝑧) 
depends on the emission angle 𝜃 and the kinetic energy of the electrons 𝐸𝑘 (or rather 𝜆(𝐸𝑘)). Various models, such as 
the Multi-Layer-Method[14], Tikhonov regularization[15], or the Maximum-Entropy-Model[16], have been proposed to 
determine concentration profiles from ARXPS data. All these models rely only on the most intense emission peak(s) in 
the XPS spectrum (one per element), which are the only peaks for which peak fitting models are available in literature. 
For depth profiling of chemical states, the peak fitting is a significant contributor to the overall uncertainty, because 
the intensity ratio largely depends on the choice of background and line shapes (see Figure S1 in the supporting 
information (SI)), for which there is often no consensus.[17]  
Each energy level in the x-ray energy range gives rise to at least one distinct emission peak in the spectrum. Albeit the 
lower-intensity peaks are virtually never analyzed. However, it has been shown that the consideration of an additional 
emission peak can improve the accuracy of concentration[18] and overlayer thickness measurements.[19] In an earlier 
publication[20], we have demonstrated that it is even possible to obtain a gradual concentration profile of oxidation
