retarded components of the polarization operators ΠR
n(ω) and ΠR
s (ω) play the role of kernels
for two components of the current: the one which is invariant with respect to a global constant
in time shift of the phase difference, and the one which is not. Therefore, we can conclude
that these polarization operators play the role of current-phase response functions for normal
current and supercurrent, respectively. The second remark is that the current through the
junction is noisy. The noise statistics is determined by the Keldysh components ΠK
n(ω) and
ΠK
s (ω) with the latter controlling the phase of the noise. The noise spectral density is related
to the retarded response function via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (5). Due to the zero-
frequency pole of coth[ħhω/(2kBTs)], the noise spectral density of a hot symmetric junction
has a logarithmic singularity. In time domain, this results in a slow 1/|t −t′| asymptotic decay
of noise correlation function, which is detrimental for the phase coherence.
In the low temperature limit with no quasiparticles, the polarization operators in time
domain are fast oscillating functions of time with the frequency of oscillations given by ∆Σ/ħh.
If the dynamics of the phase is slow, these fast oscillations are irrelevant and the adiabatic
approximation ΠR
n/s(t −t′) ∝δ(t −t′) can be employed. Under this assumption, we recover
the standard time-local current-phase relation [34]

which means that the adiabatic approximation yields the nonlinear inductor model of the
Josephson junction. This relation allows us to obtain the Josephson energy as

For a symmetric junction ∆l = ∆r = ∆with vanishing Dynes parameters νl = νr = 0, we
recover the standard Ambegaokar–Baratoff formula for the Josephson energy [76]

where RQ = 2πħh/(2e)2 ≈6.45 kΩis the resistance quantum.
In the following Sections, we explore regimes when the adiabatic approximation for the
current-phase relation breaks down. As we argued above, this can be achieved by applying a
strong microwave drive. The nonlinearity of the junction can up-convert the drive frequency
above ∆Σ/ħh, which is sufficient for observation of the memory effects. In the rest of the paper,
we fully rely on the quasiclassical approximation and neglect all the quantum effects except
the Bose–Einstein statistics of the photons. This is justified in the limit of small quantum fluctu-
ations of the phase which is controlled by the impedance of the electromagnetic environment
of the junction [51,58,59,62].

Admittance of the junction
In this section, we analyze the admittance of the junction in equilibrium and under the exter-
nal drive. We assume that the junction is biased to have a dc phase difference ϕ0 and driven
monochromatically by voltage Vd(t) = V0 cos(Ωt). By admittance we consider the linear re-
sponse of the current with respect to a weak probe voltage vp(t) which is applied in addition
to the monochromatic drive. To obtain it, we find that the total phase difference across the
junction is given by
ϕ(t) = ϕd(t) + 2e
