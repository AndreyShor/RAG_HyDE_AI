The linear and nonlinear optical properties of low-dimensional semiconductors, including
graphene,4 transition metal dichalcogenides,18 and double parabolic quantum wells,19,20 have
been extensively studied under the influence of electric and magnetic fields, considering in-
terband, extraband, and mixed transitions. These studies reveal that external fields strongly
influence the optical response of such materials. However, the zero Landau level of graphene
has often been overlooked in these analyses due to the absence of an intrinsic energy gap.
Recent research6 suggests that a gap can emerge at this level due to the polaron effect, rais-
ing fundamental questions about possible optical transitions in this regime. Investigating
these transitions necessitates an in-depth study of key optical properties, such as the optical
absorption coefficient and relative refractive index. Charge carrier confinement techniques
in low-dimensional systems have proven effective in enhancing these optical properties.21
In graphene, charge carriers behave as Dirac fermions,22–24 exhibiting chiral properties
that lead to unconventional transport phenomena. One such effect is the symmetric transmis-
sion of charge carriers across a sufficiently high electrostatic potential, which prevents their
confinement by electrostatic barriers.25–27 To address this limitation, several techniques have
been proposed,28–30 including the application of a perpendicular magnetic field,22,23 mag-
netic barriers,23–27 and an in-plane electric field.27,28 Additionally, the interaction between
charge carriers and the vibrational modes of a polar substrate has been identified as a
mechanism for inducing confinement.6,31 A perpendicular magnetic field modifies the linear
dispersion of Dirac particles, with their energy scaling as the square root of the field in-
tensity.22 Meanwhile, an in-plane electric field modulated by magnetic barriers can induce
highly asymmetric charge carrier transmission, enabling confinement even at normal inci-
dence.25 hu2015hybrid, Studies on the polaron effect in quantum dots32–34 under electric32
and magnetic fields33 have demonstrated that charge carrier-phonon interactions enhance
confinement, thereby facilitating optical transitions between energy levels. As a result, the
peaks of linear and nonlinear optical absorption coefficients shift, and the refractive index
is modified due to the polaronic effect, which is influenced by external fields.32,33 These
