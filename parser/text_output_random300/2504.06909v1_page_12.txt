(control run, blue curve) and 𝐹0 = 4 m.s-1.day-1 (superrotating state, orange curve), in the interactive-SST (a)
and fixed-SST experiments (b). The value of the globally-averaged precipitation rate in each case is given in the

In the superrotating state, the globally-averaged precipitation rate increases slightly in the
interactive-SST case (Fig. 4, a), but less than the 2 −3 %.K−1 usually found in global warm-
ing experiments (O’Gorman et al. 2012). In the fixed-SST case, however, the globally-averaged
precipitation rate decreases slightly: these two results are in agreement with tropospheric energy
budget arguments, based on the approximate balance between radiative cooling and latent heat
release above cloud base (O’Gorman et al. 2012). Perhaps more interestingly, we find a drastic
change in the meridional distribution of precipitation in the superrotating state: Precipitation is
strongly decreased in the tropics, slightly decreased in the mid-latitudes (the two regions where
the precipitation rate has local maxima in the control climate) and increased in the subtropics and
at high latitudes, leading overall to a much more homogeneous spatial distribution of precipitation
compared to the current climate. These changes are qualitatively similar between the interactive-
and fixed-SST experiments, although there are some differences: In the superrotating states, the
emergent precipitation maxima in the subtropics are further away from the equator in the fixed-SST
runs, and there are no maxima of precipitation at 30◦of latitude as in the interactive-SST runs.
These changes in the precipitation profiles are consistent with the circulation changes described
above. Indeed in the current climate, the Hadley cells transport moisture from the subtropics
