2.3.2. The cold (quasar) mode
When the black hole accretion rate exceeds the
2% Eddington accretion rate, the accretion enters
the cold mode. The cold mode is further divided
into two regimes, bounded by the Eddington rate.
Below the Eddington rate, the accretion flow is
described by the standard thin disk. 10% of the ac-
cretion power is converted to radiation, producing a
highly luminous AGN with bolometric luminosity
𝐿bol = 0.1 ¤𝑀BH𝑐2. The readers are referred to Yuan
et al. (2018) for the calculation of ¤𝑀BH. Leverag-
ing extensive observational constraints on outflows
in luminous AGN, we adopt the empirically fitted
relations for mass flux and velocity as functions
of 𝐿bol from Gofford et al. (2015), consistent with
Yuan et al. (2018):

We impose an upper limit on 𝑣wind,cold to reflect
the observed velocity saturation (Gofford et al.
2015). Although small-scale accretion disk simula-
tions suggest that outflows predominantly emerge
at the spherical polar angles 𝜃between 0◦−60◦
and 120◦−180◦(Wang et al. 2022), we adopt a
¤𝑀(𝜃) ≈cos2 𝜃distribution since the outflow open-
ing angle significantly expands as it propagates out-
ward to our inner boundary at ∼105𝑟s.
For super-Eddington accretion, similar to the case
of hot accretion mode, we do not have abundant
constraint on the properties of wind. Therefore the
wind mass flux and velocity in our model are taken
from the theoretical study of wind and jet based
on general relativity radiative transfer MHD simu-
lations of super-Eddington accretion flows around
spinning black holes (Yang et al. 2023):

𝑣wind,super ≈0.15𝑐,
(13)
where 𝑟d is the outer boundary of the super-
Eddington accretion disk with 𝑟d = min(𝑟circ, 𝑟in),
𝑟circ is the circularization radius of the accretion
flow, and ¤𝑀(𝑟d) ≈¤𝑀(𝑟in). The mass flux is con-
fined to the spherical polar angle 𝜃within 0◦−30◦
and 150◦−180◦. Following Zhu et al. (2023b), we
implement a radiative efficiency model fitted from
Jiang et al. (2019):

2.4. Star formation and stellar evolution
The star formation and stellar evolution sub-
grid model follows the prescriptions in MACER2D
(Ciotti & Ostriker 2012). We briefly summarize the
key aspects here. The implementation is based on
the Schmidt-Kennicutt law (Kennicutt 1998) and
stellar evolution models (Maraston 2005).
Gas
that exceeds a critical number density threshold
𝑛th = 1 cm−3 and falls below a critical tempera-
ture threshold 𝑇th = 104 K undergoes conversion to
stars. The conversion rate depends on a star for-
mation efficiency parameter 𝜖SF = 0.1 and a star
formation timescale 𝜏SF:
𝜏SF = max(𝜏cool, 𝜏dyn),
