environments. Benchmarking to the literature review [Jeon 2021], EB 
PHMR meander 5-ring sensors are chosen for the present study, 
which demonstrates few nT resolution and higher operational range. 
In this work, the authors investigated the performance of different ring 
sensors in detail with an optimized excitation current. In summary, 
Jeon et al. reported that 5-ring sensors could be a great choice 
especially for extremely-low frequency measurements. Thus, based 
on our future application requirements (DC-150 Hz) using these 
sensors, here we set the sensor ring numbers to five.  Furthermore, 
very few systematic studies are available on sensor characterization 
by changing the AFM/FM composition ratio, which manipulates the 
EB pinning strength. Therefore, here we evaluate the resolution of the 
different PHMR sensors based on their measured noise level and 
discuss their potential applicability in practical applications. In 
addition, this research provides insights into the noise behaviour of 
PHMR sensors, contributing to the development of low-noise sensor 
designs and signal processing techniques for enhancing their 
performance in various magnetic sensing applications. 
 
II. PRINCIPLES OF PHMR SENSORS 
 
PHMR sensors typically consist of a thin ferromagnetic film 
patterned into a cross-shaped structure [Lim 2022, Grosz 2016]. 
When a current is passed through the film, and an external in-plane 
magnetic field is applied, the resistance of the film changes due to the 
AMR effect. The AMR effect arises from the spin-orbit interaction, 
which causes the resistivity of the material to depend on the angle 
between the magnetization direction and the current flow direction. If 
current passes through the electrodes along the x axis (𝐼𝑥) then a 
voltage is induced at the electrodes along both the x and y axes. For 
cross-type junction the effective induced planar-Hall voltages can be 
expressed as, 
𝑉𝑦=
1
𝑡𝐹𝑀𝜌𝑥𝑦(𝜙)𝐼𝑥       [with, 𝜌𝑥𝑦=
1
2 Δρ sin(2𝜙)]    (1) 
Where, 𝑉𝑦 is the planar-Hall voltage, which is caused by the off-
diagonal resistivity component of 𝜌𝑥𝑦 [Lim 2022]. 𝛥𝜌= 𝜌|| − 𝜌⊥, ρ|| 
and ρ⊥ are the resistivities parallel and perpendicular to the 
magnetization, respectively. 𝜙 is the angle between the bias current 
and the magnetization. The dimensions of the cross-type sensor are l: 
length, w: width, 𝑡𝐹𝑀: thickness of ferromagnetic material. In the 
present study, Wheatstone-bridge structured multi-ring PHMR 
(mPHMR) sensors are investigated. For this hybrid structure, the 
effective PHMR voltage can be expressed as [Lim 2022], 
 
𝑉𝑦= 𝑉0𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑡+ 𝑉𝑠(𝜙)        (2) 
                 with, {
     𝑉𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑡=
𝑅1𝑅3−𝑅2𝑅4
𝑅1+𝑅2+𝑅3+𝑅4 𝐼𝑥            
𝑉𝑠(𝜙) =
1
2
𝑟
𝑤𝑡𝐹𝑀Δρ sin(2𝜙)𝐼𝑥
  
 
Here the offset voltage is contributed by an unbalance in the arms R1  
-R4 . The desired planar-Hall magnetoresistive voltage is additionally 
proportional to the width and the radius of the ring, 𝑟.  
 
III. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
A. Sensor Fabrication  
 
In this study, three different bi-layered multiring PHMR (bi-
mPHMR) sensor structures are patterned using a standard 
microfabrication process. Based on previous studies, the ring number 
is set to five [Jeon 2021]. The sensor width (w) is fixed to 40 μm with 
a gap of 0.16 mm between two consecutive rings. Thus, the total 
sensing area is approximately 88.94 μm2. In this study, unidirectional 
anisotropy is developed in the sensor using the Ni80Fe20 (Py)/Ir80Mn20 
bilayer EB mechanism. The full sensor stack for the bi-mPHMR is Ta 
(5 nm)/ Py(10-30 nm)/IrMn (10-20 nm)/Ta (5 nm) and is grown on a 
Si + SiO2 (500 nm) wafer substrate. Here, Ta (5 nm) serves as a 
capping and seed layer in order to prevent oxidation and to promote 
better crystallinity. A BESTEC magnetron sputtering system is used 
in order to deposit different metal layers with a base pressure of 6 x 
10-8 mbar and a process pressure (during sputtering) of 8 x 10-4 mbar 
in an Argon gas environment (gas flow rate: 15 sccm). The deposition 
rates for Ta, Py, and IrMn were 0.93 nm/s, 0.1 nm/s, and 0.2 nm/s, 
respectively. Note that, except for Py, all other materials are deposited 
in rf-sputtering mode. Py is deposited in dc-sputtering mode. An 
external in-plane field of 100 mT is applied to induce anisotropy in 
the sensor during growth. For this purpose, a standard NdFeB 
permanent magnet is used, which is inserted into a custom designed 
sample holder. The active sensing element and gold contact pads are 
patterned using photolithography and lift-off processes. The sensor 
and contact layers are structured in a two-stage lithographic process. 
To promote adhesion, TI Prime (Microchemicals GmbH) is spin 
coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by a baking step at 115°C for 3 
min. After cooling, AZ5214E photoresist (Microchemicals GmbH) is 
spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by a baking step at 100°C 
for 30 s. Laser writing is then performed using a Heidelberg DWL66 
Laser writer, before baking it at 115°C for 90 s and then UV-exposure 
is carried out for 45 s. In the next step, the sample is developed in a 
1:5 solution of AZ351B (Microchemicals GmbH) and deionized 
water for 40 to 120 s. After development, a passivation in deionized 
water is performed for at least 2 minutes to stop further development. 
After the deposition of the sensing layer, the second lithography step 
is performed in a similar way as for the sensing layer. The fabricated 
sensor structure is shown in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b). For better 
understanding the three different sensor stacks of Ta (5 nm)/Py(10 
nm)/IrMn (10 nm)/Ta (5 nm) , Ta(5 nm)/ Py(30 nm)/IrMn (10 nm)/Ta 
(5 nm), and Ta(5 nm)/ Py(30 nm)/IrMn (20 nm)/Ta (5 nm) are 
designated as S1, S2, and S3, respectively. For all the studied sensors 
the on-diagonal resistance (Rxx or Ryy) and off-diagonal counterpart 
(Rxy) of S1, S2, and S3 are in the range between 800 and 1300 Ohms. 
Detailed description of the resistances is tabulated in Table - I. The 
sensors are bonded to a PCB with a 25 μm Al wire using the Thin
