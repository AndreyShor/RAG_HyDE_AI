than [316]. Lu et al. [317] introduced an MDI-QKD protocol addressing modulation errors, achieving high
performance despite X basis imbalances and asymmetric channel transmittances. Yin et al. [318, 319]
removed encoding state characterization assumptions, demonstrating practicality and tolerance for high
loss and errors over 160 km. Hwang et al. [320] improved phase error estimation, and Zhou et al. [321]
extended uncharacterized qubit protocols to weak coherent sources using decoy-state methods. Kang et
al. [322, 323] developed protocols with uncharacterized coherent states under collective attacks. Li et
al. [324] proposed the CHSH-MDI-QKD protocol to mitigate state preparation assumptions, using the
CHSH inequality and decoy states [325] to enhance accuracy in single-photon yield estimation, though
increased parameter estimation complexity limited its effectiveness.
Finite-key analysis. Finite-key analysis of MDI-QKD was first conducted in [326] and [316], where they
derived secure bounds under the influence of statistical fluctuations in relative frequency. This analysis
applies to practical detectors with low efficiency and highly lossy channels. Their study demonstrates the
possibility of achieving secure transmission over distances exceeding 10 kilometers with a success rate of
1010 outcomes, making it directly applicable in practical implementations. However, when the number
of successful outcomes falls below 108, achieving a nonzero key rate becomes impossible.
Both studies mentioned above focused on security assessments against specific types of attacks. The
first study to explore security proofs within the finite-key regime against general attacks and to satisfy
the composability definition was conducted by Curty et al. [327]. They utilized the principles of large de-
viation theory, specifically employing a multiplicative form of the Chernoff bound, for critical parameter
estimation. This step was crucial in demonstrating the feasibility of implementing MDI-QKD over long
distances and within a reasonable timeframe. Their findings demonstrated that even with the technol-
ogy available at the time, an MDI-QKD protocol could be realized without the need for high-efficiency
detectors. Importantly, they showcased the potential for long-distance MDI-QKD protocols, extending
up to approximately 150 kilometers, for finite-sized data sets ranging from 1012 to 1014 signals. This
achievement was made possible using practical signal sources, such as WCPs.
5.3.2. Decoy-state measurement-device-independent QKD
The sources used in MDI-QKD must be trusted, necessitating a complete characterization of the
source. Commonly, weak coherent sources replace perfect single-photon sources, though they remain
susceptible to photon number splitting (PNS) attacks due to multiphoton fractions [328]. To counteract
this, the decoy-state method, as proposed in [312], has been adapted for MDI-QKD to estimate single-
photon contributions efficiently. Wang et al. [329] further optimized this by employing three-intensity
decoy states, which addressed basis-dependent coding errors. Subsequent enhancements, such as vacuum
and weak decoy states by Sun et al. [330], showed improved performance but highlighted the limitations
of certain methods. Advances continued with modified coherent states introduced by Li et al. [331],
reducing multiphoton distributions and enhancing key rates. Techniques to refine single-photon yield
and phase error estimation, as demonstrated by Zhu et al. [332] and Ding et al. [333], increased the
accuracy of MDI-QKD parameters and extended secure transmission distances. Other studies, such as
those by Mao et al. [334], explored new decoy-state frameworks that surpassed prior methods, further
enhancing both distance and key rates.
Incorporating heralded single-photon sources (HSPS) offers notable benefits, including reduced dark
count rates and lower QBER [335]. Wang et al. [336] showed that combining triggered and non-triggered
events in HSPS-based protocols enhances both key rates and transmission distances. Subsequent works
[337] applied biased decoy-state schemes with HSPS, yielding superior results for small datasets. Similarly,
Zhou et al. [338], introduced passive decoy methods to spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)
sources, to minimize side-channel leaks and improve performance compared to weak coherent states.
While SPDC sources offer advantages, challenges such as spectral entanglement were addressed by Zhan
et al. [339], underscoring the need for high-purity sources.
Optimization of decoy-state parameters has played a pivotal role in enhancing MDI-QKD protocols.
Techniques such as local search algorithms [340], with statistical fluctuation considerations [341], and
advanced joint constraints [342] have significantly improved key rates and extended transmission dis-
tances. Additionally, protocols integrating memory-assisted techniques [343] and asynchronous designs
[344] further push the boundaries of MDI-QKD capabilities. Asymmetric protocols [345] and reference-
frame-independent methods [346] address practical challenges like channel asymmetry and misalignment,
making MDI-QKD more adaptable for real-world applications.
