We now present the normalizable solution [1] of the quaternion-form eqn. (2.21) for general
r, k, ℓ:
¯DW(0)k×ℓ= 0 .
(A.1)
First, the four components of four-vector W(0) k×ℓ
µ
solving (A.1) are related as follows:
W(0)k×ℓ

= iW(0)k×ℓ

W(0)k×ℓ

= iW(0)k×ℓ

(A.2)
The solutions for W(0)k×ℓ

, W(0)k×ℓ

are then given in terms of
r
gcd(k,r) functions Φ(p)

(A.3)
where the volume factor V = L1L2L3L4 is included for convenience.
The solutions are
parameterized by 2r arbitrary complex coefficients C[C′+pk]r
2
and C[C′+pk]r
4
.
They are not
determined at the linear order of the λ- or ∆-expansion, as discussed in the main text (and
in [1]).
We also note that the solution we present below includes the dependence on the moduli
ϕC′
µ
of (2.7, 2.8, 2.10) in the background covariant derivative in (A.1). The precise relation
between ϕC′
µ and the ˆϕC′
µ appearing in (A.5) below is as follows31

and also obeys (2.10). To complete the solution, the

(A.5)
31Briefly, it is determined by the adjoint action of the background covariant derivative and the fact that W
is the k × ℓcomponent inside SU(N), as per (2.12).
