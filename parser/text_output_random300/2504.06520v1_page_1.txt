Abstract: Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is a powerful non-invasive imaging 
technique for high-resolution assessment of tissue elasticity and viscoelasticity. Accurate 
characterization of viscoelastic properties requires estimating shear wave speed (SWS) across 
multiple frequencies, as dispersion induces frequency-dependent variations in wave speed. This 
study introduces a novel multi-frequency reverberant OCE (MFR-OCE) approach to enhance 
viscoelastic tissue characterization by simultaneously capturing shear wave dynamics over 
multiple frequencies. We present the theoretical framework, experimental setup, and validation 
of MFR-OCE through simulations and experiments on gelatin phantoms, ex vivo porcine 
cornea, and ex vivo bovine liver. Simulation results demonstrate that MFR-OCE estimates SWS 
with errors below 4% relative to ground truth, and phantom experimental results show that 
MFR-OCE and single-frequency OCE also yield closely matching SWS estimates, with 
differences below 3%. Furthermore, the frequency-dependent dispersion coefficients extracted 
from biological tissues and phantoms align with the theoretical viscoelastic power law model. 
The gelatin phantoms exhibit a low viscoelastic behavior with an exponent of 0.13 for the power 
law fit of SWS, while the ex vivo porcine cornea demonstrates intermediate viscoelastic 
behavior, with a power law exponent of 0.33. The liver tissue shows significant frequency 
dependence, with a power law exponent of 0.51. These findings demonstrate that MFR-OCE 
enables a more comprehensive understanding of tissue mechanics and holds the potential for 
improving diagnostic accuracy in clinical applications. 
 
1. Introduction 
In the realm of biomedical imaging, the demand for non-invasive, high-resolution techniques 
for assessing tissue biomechanics continues to drive innovation. Optical coherence 
elastography (OCE) has emerged as a promising technique, offering high-resolution, non-
invasive imaging for evaluating tissue mechanical properties in vivo [1-3]. Among various OCE 
techniques, shear wave-based methods have gained substantial attention due to their ability to 
generate quantitative elasticity maps [4,5] and provide detailed insights into tissue viscoelastic 
properties [6,7]. Compared to other elastography modalities, such as magnetic resonance 
elastography and ultrasound elastography, which typically offer millimeter-scale imaging 
resolution [8,9], OCE is distinguished by its ability to achieve micrometer-scale (∼2–10 μm) 
imaging resolution [10-12]. 
Numerous studies have explored the elastic properties of biological tissues using wave-
based OCE. These investigations include measurements of the shear modulus and Young’s 
modulus of the cornea [13-16], Young’s modulus of the porcine liver [17], and the elasticity of 
mouse brain tissue [18-20]. In purely elastic materials, waves propagate without energy loss, 
resulting in a single, consistent velocity across all frequencies. However, in viscoelastic
