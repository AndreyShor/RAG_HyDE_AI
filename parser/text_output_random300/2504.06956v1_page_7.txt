In [Mad15], Madaule proved that there exists a constant c > 0 such that
sup
x∈B(0,1)
Xb(x) −mb −c ⇒G + log µγc(B(0, 1))
in law as b →∞, where G is an independent random variable with standard Gumbel distribution, and
µγc is the critical GMC. Hence, if we aim to describe the shape of the field around a point where the
value of the field is comparable to its maximum, it seems natural to condition the field Xb on achieving
the value mb + z at the origin, for some fixed z ∈R, while simultaneously requiring that the origin is
a mesoscopic maximum. We first zoom in around the origin by introducing the rescaled field
Xb(·)
def= Xb(e−b·) .
We now introduce some Gaussian fields that will play an important role in our analysis.
Definition 2.3. For b ∈R+ ∪{∞}, we let Φb be the centred Gaussian field on Rd such that, for all x,
y ∈Rd,
E[Φb(x)Φb(y)] = ab(x) + ab(y) −ab(x −y) .
Moreover, for b ∈R+ ∪{∞}, we let Υb be the Gaussian field on Rd given by
Υb(·)
def= Φb(·) −
√
2dab(·) .
Remark 2.4. As one can easily check, the covariance of the field Φ∞resembles very much the
covariance structure of the DGFF on Z2 pinned to zero at zero (see [BL18, Equation (2.7)]). Indeed,
in this setting, the covariance takes the same form as for the field Φ∞with a∞: Z2 →R given by the
potential kernel of the simple symmetric random walk started from zero (see [BL18, Equation (2.8)]).
Now, going back to our previous discussion, a straightforward calculation shows that the field Xb
conditioned to take the value mb + z at the origin has the same law as the shifted field
Xb(·) −hb(·)(Xb(0) −(mb + z)) .
In particular, for every x, y ∈Rd sufficiently close (much less than eb) to the origin, we note that, for
b > 0 large enough, it holds that
E[(Xb(x) −hb(x)Xb(0))(Xb(y) −hb(y)Xb(0))] ≈ab(x) + ab(y) −ab(x −y) ,
and also
(mb + z) −(mb + z)hb(x) ≈
√
2dab(x) .
Therefore, the preceding computations imply that
(Xb(·) −hb(·)(Xb(0) −(mb + z))) −(mb + z) ≈Φb(·) −
√
2dab(·) = Υb(·) .
Hence, recalling Definition 2.3, we aim at describing the limit in law as b →∞of the field Υb under
the condition that the origin is close to being a maximum in the ball of radius eb centred at the origin.
Before doing so, we introduce some additional notation. For k ≥0, we set
Rk
def= {F : C(Rd) →R : F(ϕ) = F(ψ) whenever ϕ|B(0,k) = ψ|B(0,k)} .
(2.3)
In other words, Rk is the set of (measurable) mappings from C(Rd) to R that depend on the values of
the input function only inside B(0, k). Furthermore, with a slight abuse of the usual notation, we
define
Cb
loc(C(Rd))
def=
[
k≥0
Rk ∩Cb(C(Rd)) ,
(2.4)
where Cb denotes continuous bounded functions. We can now state our first main result, where we
write M0,b(f) as a shorthand for sup|x|≤eb f(x).
