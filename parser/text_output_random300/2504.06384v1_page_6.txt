FIG. 3:
In the ﬁrst panel, we plot the secret key rate of
Eq. (20) (black line) for the Gaussian modulation protocol
with coherent states and homodyne detection in direct recon-
ciliation against N. We set dB = 0.02. We have optimized
over V and n/N. The rest of the parameters, settings and
lines are the same as in Fig. 1. With red ink, we plot the
points included in Table I of the corresponding Msparse, i.e.,
the actual storage needed for these sparse matrices after cre-
ating them in CRS format using the GMCS simulation library
in [62].
combine tools developed in previous studies to charac-
terize the requirements in storage during one-way EC
and especially the encoding part which is executed by
one of the parties. Note that the DR protocol is advan-
tageous in this regime because it can give higher rates
for smaller block size and can support lightweight and
agile transmitters responsible for the EC encoding while
the bulkier receivers can be better suited for computa-
tionally intensive tasks such as the EC decoding in an
assymetric scenario: for example, a network of small sen-
sors transmitting to a central processing unit.
The syndrome creation, i.e., encoding process, is the
less diﬃcult part of the one-way EC with LDPC codes. In
contrast, the decoding process is rather demanding and
can be eﬀectively handled by larger stations rather than
a constrained device. In such an asymmetric scenario in
terms of computational power, for an appropriate loss
tolerance, the party operating through the constrained

FIG. 4: In the ﬁrst panel, we plot the secret key rate of
Eq. (20) (black line) for the Gaussian modulation protocol
with coherent states and homodyne detection in RR against
N. We have set the loss to 0.02 dB. The rest of the parame-
ters, settings and lines are the same as in Fig. 1. We observe
here, that we need a larger block size in order to obtain a
secret key rate compared to the DR protocol in Fig. 3. This
is because the DR protocol oﬀers higher rates than the RR
protocol in the low loss regime.
device is the transmitter and also the encoder during
EC. This describes the DR protocol. In this setting, one
can exploit the trade-oﬀbetween limitations in robust-
ness against losses with the mitigation of computational-
power requirements.
Then, one still needs to check the compatibility with
storage requirements for the parity check matrix as the
main aspect of the EC encoding procedure. In partic-
ular, the amount of leakage calculated in Eq. (10) that
achieves a speciﬁc performance in terms of secret key
rate in Eqs. (20) can be mapped to the associated LDPC
code rate in Eq. (26) and, in turn, to the dimensions
of the related parity-check matrices that give the asso-
ciated leakage. Then we can predict the related storage
requirements by Eq. (30).
In Fig. 3, we can see the behaviour of M ∗
sparse against
the block-size. For speciﬁc block sizes, we have created
the parity check matrices for the corresponding encod-
ing process in EC and stored them in sparse form. The
