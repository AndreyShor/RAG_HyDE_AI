tensity integrated over the range ℏω=[1.3, 1.7] meV at
T=1.7 K and T=40 K. Notably, the patterns appear
similar to each other and to that in Figure 1(c), demon-
strating that the elevated temperature of T ∼J/5 min-
imally affects the spin excitations.
Additional data at
T=1.7 K and T=40 K appear in Figure 8 in the Extended
Data.
Panels (c-f) depict cuts through the spectrum
along various symmetry directions in reciprocal space.
Here, clear continuum scattering is observed, consistent
with fractionalized spinon excitations [11]. Temperature-
dependent changes between the data only appear below
∼1.2 meV where impurities start to play a role, highlight-
ing the temperature robustness of the intrinsic kagome
scattering at higher energies. These data also show that
the spinon excitations in Zn-barlowite (from ∼1.2 to
∼3 meV) have remarkably little dependence on energy,
similar to observations in herbertsmithite [11].
At an even higher temperature, Figure 3(a) shows

ing its relative independence on energy transfer and
robustness to changes in temperature. (a, b) Inelas-
tic scattering pattern integrated over ℏω=[1.3, 1.7] meV at

Data shown were all
taken with incident energy Ei=3.32 meV. (a, b) share a com-
mon intensity scale as do (c-f).

ℏω=[1.3, 1.7] meV at T=150 K showing persistent star-shaped
scattering.
(b) Energy dependent magnetic scattering in-
tensity integrated over the cyan-highlighted q-region in (a)
for sample temperatures T=1.7 K and T=40 K. Error bars
for T=1.7 K and T=40 K are statistical counting errors.
Line plots show estimated scattering for T=40 K based on
the T=1.7 K data scaled by statistics for different models:

excited state; and (dotted) those associated with magnons.
Both are shown to diverge from the observed data.
the scattered intensity measured at T=150 K integrated
over the energy range ℏω=[1.3, 1.7] meV. The pattern
is similar to the T = 1.7 K data in Figure 1(c), imply-
ing intrinsic kagome correlations persist up to temper-
atures approaching J. Panel (b) shows the energy de-
pendence of S(q, ω) integrated over the q-region high-
lighted in panel (a) for temperatures T=1.7 K and
T=40 K. The overlap of the data above ∼1.5 meV sug-
gests the scattering does not follow the thermal statis-
tics of conventional magnetic systems. The dotted line
shows the expected T=40 K scattering derived from
applying the thermal factor associated with magnons
to the T=1.7 K data.
The clear disagreement is con-
sistent with the lack of magnetic ordering in the sys-
tem.
Alternatively, for a system with a ground state
and an excited state that are both highly degenerate,
the ratio of intensities would follow S(ω, T1)/S(ω, T2) =
[nd + exp(−β2ℏω)] / [nd + exp(−β1ℏω)], where nd gives
the ratio of the ground state degeneracy to the ex-
cited state degeneracy. An isolated dimer model with a
triplet excited state and singlet ground state would have
nd = 1/3; the solid line in Figure 3(b) shows the ex-
pected T=40 K scattering for this model which also fails
to describe the data. Fitting the data above 1.5 meV (to
avoid the effects of impurities), we find that a large rela-
tive ground state degeneracy would be required (nd ≥30)
to best describe the measured data. Hence, neither the
thermal behavior of magnons nor that of isolated dimers
can describe the observed spin excitations.
