FIG. 3: Two kinds of coupling schemes. The left panel shows
the wave function coupling mode of Eq. (33), and the right
panel shows the coupling mode of Eq. (34).
In Refs. [46, 50], the coupling scheme of spin and orbit
is a little bit like the ”light degree of freedom” in heavy
quark symmetry, i.e., the gluon field couples the two rel-
ative angular momenta Lq¯q,g and Lq¯q first to become an
excited constituent gluon, then this excited gluon cou-
ples to Sq¯q to obtain the total angular momentum J (left
panel of Fig. 3), which can be symbolically written as
ψJ,g

However, this kind of coupling scheme is a little com-
plicated to be used into calculation since the spin wave
functions of gluon and q¯q cluster are separated. In prac-
tice, to treat a three-body quantum system like baryon,
the L −S coupling scheme is often used (right panel of
Fig. 3), whose wave function can be constructed as

Actually, from quantum theory of angular momentum
[60], we can build a relation between these two schemes,
which can be explicitly written out by using a 6j-symbol
and a 9j-symbol as

More details on the transition amplitude from a hybrid
to two mesons
Since our transition operator is written in momentum
space, to adopt it to get the amplitude, we should firstly
transform the wave functions into the momentum repre-
sentation as

where (2π)

2 comes due to our notation that space vectors
are normalized to (2π)3.
Then, by a similar treatment that used in the 3P0
model, for the process where a hybrid A decays into two
mesons B and C, the transition amplitude, which is very
similar as in Refs. [57], is
