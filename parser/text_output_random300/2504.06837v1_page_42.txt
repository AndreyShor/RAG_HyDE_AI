Superlinear functions: Proof of Lemma 3.3
Lemma 3.3 involves the superlinear functions φ and ψ and constructs another superlinear
function Ξ = Ξφ,ψ. It is a generalization of (3.4d) which corresponds to φ = C and ψ(w) = cwp
with p > 1. Then ψC can be estimated below by cpC.
It is easy to see that Ξ is even and increasing on [0, ∞) as s 7→wφ(s/w) is so for each
w > 0. As ψ is increasing and w 7→wφ(s/w) is decreasing (as sφ′(s) ≥φ(s)) we have the lower
estimate
Ξ(s) ≥min{w∗φ(s/w∗), ψ(w∗)}
for all w∗> 0,
and it remains to choose w∗appropriate for each s.
The superlinearity of ψ provides for each M > 1 a wM ≥1 such that ψ(wM) ≥MwM. For
sM = M1/2wM and using C(s|w) = wC(s/w) we thus obtain

for M →∞, which implies sM →∞. As Ξ is increasing on [0, ∞), the desired superlinearity
of Ξ and Lemma 3.3 are established.

Gagliardo-Nirenberg
To prove Proposition 5.4, we will use a variant of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg estimate handling
spatial and temporal integrability according to the a priori estimates from the L∞bound for
the energy and the L2 bound for the dissipation. We will use the classical dimension-dependent
Gagliardo-Nirenberg estimate
∥u∥Lq(Td) ≤Cq,d∥u∥1−θq
L2(Td)∥u∥θq
H1(Td)
with θq = d

q,
where q ∈[2, ∞) and (d−2)q ≤2d. With this, we obtain for α > 0 and r ≥1 with αr ≥2 and
(d−2)αr ≤2d the estimate
