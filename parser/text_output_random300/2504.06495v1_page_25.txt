and let µ = log α + eµ. Then, the continuous-time counterpart of (14) becomes
dXτ = −µ dτ + σ dWτ,
if Xτ ≥log(ǫ),
Xτ = −∞,
otherwise.

The ﬁrst line of the last display describes Xτ as a Brownian motion with drift for Xτ above the
barrier log(ǫ). The second line enforces truncation (i.e., Xτ = −∞) upon hitting the barrier,
as in the discrete-time case. We now present the continuous-time analogue of Theorem 2.
Theorem 3 Let {Xτ : τ ≥0} be the stochastic process deﬁned in (18) with parameters
µ, σ, ǫ > 0. Then, for all xa, xb > log ǫ, we have:
lim
τ→∞
P(Xτ ̸= −∞| X0 = xa)
P(Xτ ̸= −∞| X0 = xb) = exp

The proof of the theorem, given in the appendix, draws on spectral theory for diﬀusion
processes with absorbing boundaries from Karlin and Taylor (1981).

(2003). In terms of the original process Φτ = ατ exp(Xτ), this result yields the continuous-
time counterpart of (15):
lim
τ→∞
P(Φτ > 0 | Φ0 = φa)
P(Φτ > 0 | Φ0 = φb) =

with β = µ/σ2 unchanged.
However, a notable simpliﬁcation arises in the continuous-time setting: The result here
holds for any ﬁxed ǫ > 0, without requiring the limit ǫ →0. In contrast, the discrete-time
result in Theorem 2 required this limit due to the discontinuous, step-wise nature of the
process. Brownian motion, with its continuous sample paths, eliminates this granularity.
Still, the fact that (19) holds for ﬁnite ǫ is somewhat surprising. The following inductive
argument is not a proof, but oﬀers a heuristic rationale for why the result here holds at
ﬁnite ǫ.
