Power Network Data
Using PowerWorld, the substation and branch data files are exported as two Comma Separated
Value (CSV) files.
• Substation data: Tables ?? and 2 provide examples of substations’ locations, identifiers,
and other attributes for the 500-bus case. Substations are classified into generation and
transmission. Generation substations list their power outputs under the Gen MW and
