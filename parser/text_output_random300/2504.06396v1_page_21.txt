improved techniques and their validation for planning, detection, and response, to assess, avoid,

An algorithm for generating a comprehensive cyber-physical model was developed in SAM-GT,
offering a versatile approach that can accommodate any power system model and transform it
into a cyber-physical network, presenting the results in the form of a JSON file. The algorithm’s
applicability and effectiveness are demonstrated through its implementation in three fictitious
power systems: a 500-bus test case situated in South Carolina, a 2000-bus test case in Texas, and a
10,000-bus test case on the Western United States. Each test case was modeled using three different
network topologies such as star, radial, and statistics-based topology. One notable feature of this
work is its generality, making it suitable for adaptation to a wide range of power system networks.
To model the data flows, four different communication protocols are used in this current model as
it can be easily altered for future use. We aim to improve the algorithm’s versatility by allowing users
to specify communication protocols as input. This enhancement recognizes that communication
protocols can vary based on the utility’s location and type, making it a valuable user-configurable
feature. Another configurable feature should be the relay connections within a substation, partially
determined by the substation topology.
In future work, we plan to improve how utility control center locations are chosen and which
substations are connected to them. When using the radial topology, we noticed that some generation
substations are connected to multiple transmission substations. We can use this information to
group all these substations under the same utility control center.
