which is uniformly bounded for 1 ă q ă 8. For a suitable constant C2, we then obtain

and taking p ą 1 sufficiently close to 1 we have 2p1 ´ 1

Proof of Theorem 1.7. Fix t ą 0 and ϑ P R. Our goal is to prove (1.21). We also fix
ε ą 0 and some integer r ą ε. For N P N, we define the random linear form

where the constant c accounts for the discrepancy between the cardinality

In particular, choosing φ “ ϕ or φ “ ψpiq, 1 ď i ă 2d, we see that both bounds in (3.18)
are satisfied for γ “ ´ε, hence pT ω
N qNPN is tight in Cγ1
for all γ1 ă ´ε ´ 2
p. Since ε ą 0 and
p P 2N are arbitrary, we conclude that pT ω
N qNPN is tight in C´ε for any ε ą 0.
By the direct half of Prohorov’s theorem [Bil99, Theorem 5.1] (which holds for metric
spaces), tightness implies relative compactness. It remains to show that, for any weakly
converging subsequence T ω
Nk Ñ T ω, the limit T ω has the same law as the SHF Z ϑ,ω
t
.
The law of any random element T ω of Cγ is determined by the laws of the random vectors
pT ωpφ1q, . . . , T ωpφkqq for k P N and φ1, . . . , φk P C8
c . By the linearity of φ ÞÑ T ωpφq and
the Cramer-Wold device, it is enough to focus on the law of T ωpφq for a given φ P C8
c . It only
remains to show that T ωpφq has the same distribution as Z ϑ,ω
t
pφq: but this follows from the
convergence in distribution (1.20) in the vague topology, which yields T ω
Nkpφq Ñ Z ϑ,ω

in distribution for any φ P C8

4. Proof of Theorem 1.8
In this section we prove (1.25). By translation invariance, we only consider the case x “ 0.
We also set for simplicity t “ 1 (the proof extends to any t ą 0 with almost no change).
Throughout this section, we fix ϱ P p0, 8q and, to lighten notation, we abbreviate
