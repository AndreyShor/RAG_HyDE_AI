We can equally interpret Det A = 0 as the condition for the intersection
IA =




to degenerate. To see this, let us deﬁne
fk(⃗x, ⃗y) =
X
i,j
Ak,i,jxiyj ,
k = 1, 2 .
(5.18)
The variety IA is singular at a point if and only if f1 = f2 = 0 and
rank
 
∂x1f1 ∂x2f1 ∂y1f1 ∂y2f1
∂x1f2 ∂x2f2 ∂y1f2 ∂y2f2
!
≤1 .
(5.19)
The latter condition just means that there exists ⃗p ∈P1 such that
X
k,j
Ak,a,jpkyj = 0 ,
X
k,i
Ak,i,bpkxi = 0 ,
a, b = 1, 2 .
(5.20)
Therefore a point in P1 × P1 is a singular point on IA if and only if the determinant of the
hypermatrix Ak,i,j vanishes.
Degeneration loci in the space of 2 × 2 × 2 hypermatrices
As was discussed for
example in [67], the space M of 2 × 2 × 2 hypermatrices contains subspaces ∇, ∇cusp of
respective codimensions 1 and 3 such that
0 ∈∇cusp ⊂∇⊂M .
(5.21)
The subset ∇⊂M consists of the matrices with vanishing hyperdeterminant while ∇cusp is
the set of singular points of ∇. Depending on the choice for A, the variety IA then takes the
following form
IA =









2 points for A ∈M\∇,
1 point
for A ∈∇\∇cusp ,
P1
for A ∈∇cusp\{0} ,
P1 × P1
for A = 0 .
(5.22)
Let us introduce the divisors J1 = { x1 = 0 } and J2 = { y1 = 0 } on P1 × P1 and denote
the degree of a curve C by (d1, d2) = (J1, J2) · C. For hypermatrices A ∈∇cusp\{0} we can
then further distinguish the following three cases, that we refer to as Type Ai, i = 1, 2, 3:
1. The degeneration of Type A1 corresponds to
rank

A[1, 1] A[1, 2]

A1,1,1 A1,1,2 A2,1,1 A2,1,2
A1,2,1 A1,2,2 A2,2,1 A2,2,2
!
= 1 .
(5.23)
Then there exists a unique point ⃗x ∈P1 for which the conditions on ⃗y ∈P1 vanish
identically. It is also clear that this is the only point ⃗x for which a solution ⃗y exists and
one ﬁnds that IA ≃P1 is a rational curve of degree (0, 1).
