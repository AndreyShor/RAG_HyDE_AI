Figure S2. Drawing of the cross-section of a TEM-lamella, illustrating why the depth profile of an oxide overlayer of a rough 
thin film cannot be determined with high resolution and is likely to be overestimated. 
 
3. X-ray Reflectivity 
The fitting of the XRR data was performed in GenX[1] version 2.4.9 (homepage: http://genx.sf.net). The densities of 
SnO and SnTe are very similar, which is why the exact values obtained from the XRR model are unreliable. During 
fitting, the values varied more than the apparent deviation between the densities given in Table S1 and their 
corresponding literature values for bulk material (𝜌𝑡−𝑆𝑛𝑂≈6.29 g/cm3 ≙1.63 e−/Å3 and 𝜌𝑐−𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒≈6.32 g/cm3 ≙
1.59 e−/Å3 according to materialsproject.org[2]). It is not possible to draw definite conclusions from this model, 
because multiple plausible parametrizations are consistent with the measured data. The literature values for the 
densities of bulk materials were therefore used to calculate the XPS models.

4. Mathematical Expressions 
The following equations S1-S3 are the same as eq. 1-3 in the paper, shown here with the integrals of the depth 
distribution functions from which they were derived. The integrals are illustrated in Figure S3. Eq. 1/S1 is well known 
and widely used for native oxide overlayers:
