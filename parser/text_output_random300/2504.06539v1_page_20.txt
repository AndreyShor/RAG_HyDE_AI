We consider that large gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by the thermal background. The
broken symmetry transformation introduces a regulator determined by the boundary condition at
reheating. After regularization, the IR graviton modes remain constant, and the secular term is
removed.
In this paper, we did not consider the decoherence of inflationary gravitons and assumed that
λ ̸= 0, which might be a crucial simplification. From an engineering perspective, preparing localized
radiation with high temperatures is more feasible, similar to the quark-gluon plasma generated in
colliders.
Such a limited volume of thermal bath differs from our setup, where we assumed a
homogeneous radiation background. Still, it is important because it may allow for the realization
of a specific thermal bath configuration that induces large stimulated emission without significant
backreaction effects.

The formulas obtained in the in-in formalism
The graviton number and internal phase at second order in the interaction Hamiltonian are given
by [22]:
n2 = Re [ζ(2n0 + 1) + 2σλ∗

λ2 = 2ζλ0 + σ(2n0 + 1),

The positive frequency mode function for the field operator at τ, with respect to the vacuum state
at τ0, is denoted by uk(τ, τ0). Unlike the calculation in the main text, here we integrate overtime
twice, and the operators inside the integrand are time-ordered. While λ2 is not explicitly derived
in the reference, its derivation closely follows that of n2.
