FIG. 2. Phase diagram of heavy-quark QCD in the presence of
a color probe. The outer plain curve represents the deconfine-
ment transition while the inner plain curve separates, within
the confined phase, the regions where the medium screens a
static quark probe via a meson-like or a baryon-like configura-
tion. This line was cut around where the plateau ∆Qq + 1 = 3
ceases to be relevant. The dashed line is the qualitative esti-
mate derived from Eq. (12), while the quantitative estimate
derived from Eq. (17) is indistinguishable from the full result.
that, for |µ| ≥M, ℓand ¯ℓboth approach nonvanishing
constants and thus that ∆Qq and ∆Q¯q approach 0, that
is, ∆Qq +1 and ∆Q¯q −1 approach 1 and −1 respectively,
see Fig. 1. The nonvanishing limits of ℓand ¯ℓmean that
there is no low-temperature confined phase in that case.
This is consistent with the vanishing of ∆Qq and ∆Q¯q,
which means that the medium does not try to screen the
color probe.
Finally, in the high-temperature limit, the glue poten-
tial approaches the Weiss potential [14]. Together with
the quark contribution it is then easily seen that ℓand
¯ℓboth approach 1 and thus that ∆Qq + 1 and ∆Q¯q −1
approach 1 and −1 respectively, see Fig. 1. The inter-
pretation is then similar to the limit T →0 for |µ| ≥M:
the medium is deconfined and does not try to screen the
color probes.
Figure 1 also shows results at non-zero temperatures.
Those have been obtained using the center-symmetric
Curci-Ferrari (CF) model [15] that provides a well-tested
expression for the glue potential [16, 17]. For temper-
atures below the deconfinement transition temperature,
we observe once again two plateaus for ∆Qq + 1 in the
confined phase, at 0 and 3, this time connected by a
smooth transition with 0 < ∆Qq + 1 < 3, which we in-
terpret as a competition, due to thermal fluctuations,
between the formation of a meson-like or a baryon-like
configuration to screen the quark probe.
Actually, for
heavy quarks, this happens throughout most of the con-
fined phase, leading to the phase diagram of Fig. 2. As
we now show, the presence of plateaus at finite T is a
model-independent feature, whereas the way the transi-
tion occurs from 0 to 3 depends on the model for Vglue.
Above, we presented an analysis of the confined phase
at T = 0 and |µ| < M that relied on the smallness of the
Polyakov loops. But because the transition temperature
at any µ is far below the here considered heavy quark
masses, our argument should apply at any temperature
and chemical potential in the bulk of the phase diagram,
as long as the Polyakov loops remain small. As already
mentioned, however, the linearization of the equations
that we used is not fully consistent at finite tempera-
tures. This is because, owing to the center symmetry of
Vglue, each linearized equation involves only ℓor ¯ℓ. But
for µ > 0, ℓis of the order of ¯ℓ2 and thus one cannot ne-
glect contributions of order ¯ℓ2 in the equation involving ℓ.
These corrections are easily and consistently accounted
for, however, by including the term 1
2∂3
¯ℓVglue × (0, ¯ℓ2)t to
the left-hand side of Eq. (10), where the cubic deriva-
tive is to be taken at ℓ= ¯ℓ= 0 and is not constrained to
vanish from Eq. (5). The equation determining ¯ℓis not
modified for µ > 0. For µ < 0, the roles of ℓand ¯ℓ, and
thus of the corresponding ∆Qq + 1 and ∆Q¯q −1, are in-
verted. The rest of the calculation follows the same steps,
and we get the same expression as above for ∆Q¯q −1,
while ∆Qq + 1 is given by

Again, it is implicitly understood that the derivatives of
Vglue are evaluated at ℓ= ¯ℓ= 0. Owing to the definition
of C and the assumption that the glue potential vanishes
as a power law as T →0, one finds that D behaves as a
power law in this limit. This implies that in the T →0
limit, one retrieves a step function separating 0 and 3
at µ = M/3, in line with our findings obtained using the
linear approximation. We mention that in the case where
the sign of D is negative as T →0, the convergence to-
wards the step function is not uniform around µ = M/3.
We have checked that in the presently used CF model
and also in the models of Refs. [12, 13] the sign of D
is positive (acually D approaches 1), ensuring a uniform
limit [18].
At finite temperature, the presence of two plateaus at
0 and 3 is still a model-independent result, but the value
at which the change from 0 to 3 depends on the model
for Vglue.
Defining it from the inflection of ∆Qq + 1,
we find the value µ = (T/3) ln(D fβM/f2βM), which is
also the value at which the approximated expression
(17) for ∆Qq + 1 lies at 3/2, halfway between 0 and 3.
We insist that this description is valid as long as we do
not get too close to the transition so that the Polyakov
loops remain small enough. Close to the transition, in
particular near a critical point (at µ2 > 0 or µ2 < 0),
