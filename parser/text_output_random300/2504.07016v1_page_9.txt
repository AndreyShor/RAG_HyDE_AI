recovers the three-dimensional bulk metric under additional geometric and topological assumptions.
The second [28] recovers individual two-dimensional minimal surfaces in a general setting but does
not address how these surfaces can be “glued” together to reconstruct the full three-dimensional
bulk metric.
It remains an open question whether the methods developed in [28, 39] can be extended to
non-compact Riemannian manifolds with asymptotic infinity. Our linearized approach avoids the
potential complications of these methods in the non-compact setting while still providing physically
relevant insights into the bulk reconstruction problem. The restriction to first-order perturbations
also allows us to develop reconstruction methods that are also computationally tractable. To provide
context and motivation for our approach, we next outline how metric recovery is achieved in the
compact case and under what conditions. This discussion naturally leads into the methodology
employed in the present work.

The recovery of minimal surfaces from the area
data of minimal surfaces in [28] relies on the higher-
order linearization method, a technique recently de-
veloped in the study of inverse problems for non-
linear partial differential equations [26, 27, 41]. To
explain the method in more detail, suppose that X
is a manifold with boundary ∂X equipped with a
Riemannian metric g. Consider also an embedded
minimal surface Σ whose boundary ∂Σ lies entirely
in ∂X.
Next consider nearby minimal surfaces, which
can be considered as solutions u = uµ to the min-
imal surface equation (see e.g. [4, Appendix B.2])

where α, β correspond to coordinates on the surface and the other Greek indices go from
1, . . . , dim(X).
We let the nearby solutions anchor to ∂X in a manner, which is described by
three deformations F1, F2, and F3 of ∂Σ and their magnitudes ϵ1, ϵ2, and ϵ3. This gives us a three
parameter family of minimal surfaces, which we write as
uϵ1F1+ϵ2F2+ϵ3F3.
Each uϵ1F1+ϵ2F2+ϵ3F3 is the unique solution to the minimal surface equation determined by the
deformation ϵ1F1 +ϵ2F2 +ϵ3F3 of ∂Σ, illustrated in Fig. 2, and ϵ1 = ϵ2 = ϵ3 = 0 corresponds to the
original minimal surface Σ with boundary ∂Σ. In [28], the minimal surfaces are two-dimensional,
so the functions Fj are defined on one-dimensional manifolds. In the current work, the functions Fj
can for example be defined on the circle S1, which corresponds to the intersection of a hemisphere
with the asymptotic infinity. See Section 3.2. (To avoid possible confusion, we mention that [28]
uses Fermi-coordinates to write the minimal surface equation (2.5).)
Let us use the notation ϵ = 0 to denote ϵ1 = ϵ2 = ϵ3 = 0. By taking the derivative ∂ϵj|ϵ=0 of
the minimal surface uϵ1F1+ϵ2F2+ϵ3F3, we have that the function
