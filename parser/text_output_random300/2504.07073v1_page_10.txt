Fig. 6. HRD containing the positions of the stars in our sample for the Galaxy (left), LMC (middle), and SMC (right) over-plotted by stellar

ther during core-H burning. Nevertheless, in both models, with
the new and the standard mass-loss rates, all stars expand to an
RSG phase and all models penetrate the HD limit for a noticeable
time. During this time the stellar models efficiently lose their H-
rich envelope, allowing them to become WR stars. Similarly to
the Galactic case, the models with our new mass-loss recipe end
their lives as WN-type stars, while the models with the standard
mass-loss recipe will finish their evolution as WC-type stars. In
both cases, the predicted RSGs and WRs exhibit luminosities
exceeding those observed.
At SMC metallicity, the weak mass-loss rates have minimal
influence on the evolution of stars with initial masses of 15 M⊙
and 30 M⊙. Even at higher initial masses, the differences during
the main sequence are small. The models using the new mass-
loss recipe lose less mass during their evolution and thus inflate
less and reach their terminal age main sequence at higher tem-
peratures. Similar to the LMC models, most of the H-rich enve-
lope is lost during an RSG phase. Given that at this metallicity
the mass-loss rates of our recipe are about one order of mag-
nitude lower than the ones from Nugis & Lamers (2000) (see
also Sect. 4.3.2), the single star models using our mass-loss rates
never fully strip and do not become He- or WR stars.
This comparison highlights how adopting our new mass-loss
recipe influences a star’s ultimate fate. Different mass-loss rates
result in different core-to-envelope ratios, affecting the stars’ in-
ternal structures and subsequent evolution. This is particularly
important in the high-mass regimes where an inefficient strip-
ping of an envelope can lead to a different composition at core
collapse, changing the final supernova from type Ib/c to IIb or
even II. This greatly impacts the mechanical feedback and chem-
ical enrichment associated with the supernova, hence its impact
on a galaxy’s evolution. Furthermore, having in general lower
mass-loss rates could potentially reduce the longstanding mass
discrepancy problem, where spectroscopic masses inferred from
observations often do not match evolutionary masses derived
from stellar models. Nevertheless, we emphasize that besides ˙M
it is crucial to understand the mixing processes within the stars
as well as to incorporate updated mass-loss rates for RSGs (see,
e.g., Zapartas et al. 2024), and eruptive mass loss (e.g., as dis-
cussed by Langer et al. 1994; Maeder 1997; Ekström et al. 2012;
Vink & Sabhahit 2023; Cheng et al. 2024).
4.4.2. Binary evolution
Additionally, we performed test calculations of binary evolution
models with primary stars of initial masses M1 = 30 M⊙and
60 M⊙, a fixed initial mass ratio of qini = 0.8, and initial orbital
periods of Pini = 10 d and Pini = 100 d (i.e., Case A and Case
B systems). Figure 7 displays the evolutionary tracks of the pri-
mary stars using the new and standard mass-loss rates.
In our models, we generally see that primaries in shorter-
period systems lose more of their hydrogen-rich envelopes dur-
ing mass-transfer events. This leads to lower final masses, with
approximately 1 M⊙– 2 M⊙difference in the final stellar masses
for the models with Pini = 10 d and Pini = 100 d.
In the set of the Galactic models, the primaries using the
standard mass-loss recipe lose significantly more mass on the
main sequence (lower luminosity and terminal age main se-
quence at lower temperature) compared to the models calculated
using our mass-loss rates, meaning that there is already a notice-
able difference in mass when these stars enter the mass-transfer
phase. While the tracks of models with different mass-loss pre-
scriptions can appear similar after the mass-transfer phase, the
physical properties of the primaries are distinct. Models using
the new mass-loss rates result in primaries that are a few solar
masses more massive after mass transfer compared to those cal-
culated with the standard mass-loss rates, emphasizing the long-
term impact of early evolutionary stages on the final fate of the
star.
After mass transfer, the 30 M⊙primaries calculated with the
standard mass-loss recipe efficiently lose most of their H-rich
envelopes and rapidly transition to the He-zero-age main se-
