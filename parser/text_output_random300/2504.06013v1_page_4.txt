is proportional to the torsion tensor in this simple two-
dimensional example of constant torsion.
If the torsion coefficients are general functions, it is
more difficult to extract physical intuition related to the
energy-momentum tensor as well as the spin density.
This motivates a graphical analysis of various torsion
fields, which will be the subject of the following section.

GENERIC TORSION: VISUALIZATIONS
Curvature, as a concept, can be visualized straightfor-
wardly since curved spaces can often be embedded into
Euclidean space. This is helpful in building physical in-
tuition for the geometric picture of general relativity’s
description of gravitation. Conversely, spaces with non-
vanishing torsion can often bot be embedded in Euclidean
space. With increased focus on torsion both in telepar-
allel gravity [16] as well as the physics of solids [17, 18],
different strategies need have been employed for visual-
ization techniques. In two dimensions, those techniques
are particularly simple, and we will briefly review existing
ones and then build on them slightly, with a particular
focus on autoparallels and the operational understanding
of torsion.
For the sake of concreteness, we would like to focus on
three concrete examples of torsion backgrounds, two of
which are highly symmetrical, and one of which is more
generic:
1. Rotational torsion:
Ttx
µ = (τ, χ) = 0.3(−x, t)
(35)
2. Boost torsion:
Ttx
µ = (τ, χ) = 0.3(x, t)
(36)
3. Generic torsion:
Ttx
µ = (τ, χ) = 0.15(t2 −0.4x2 −1, t −0.9x)
(37)
To track the influence of the metric signature, we will
consider all three torsion configurations for both the
spacetime case (ϵ = +1) as well as the spatial case
(ϵ = −1), resulting in a total of six distinct scenarios.
Recall that in the spatial case we relabel t →y for con-
venience.
A.
Canonical visualization (local)
We begin by recalling that torsion prevents infinites-
imal parallelograms to close, as highlighted by Car-
tan (and summarized by Hehl & Obukhov [19, 20])
or Schouten [21].
Assuming that this parallelogram is
spanned by two vectors U µ and V µ, we may compute
the parallel transport of them along each other.
The
change of U µ parallel transported along V µ, to leading
order, is given by
δU µ = V α∂αU µ = −Γµ
αβV αU β ∗= −Kµ
αβV αU β , (38)
where the last equality holds in the flat spacetime coordi-
nates where eΓλµν = 0. Hence, the torsion tensor emerges
as the difference of the two changes,
δU µ −δV µ = −Γµ
αβ(V αU β −V βU α)
= T αβ
µU αV β .
(39)
This torsion projection is related to the commutator of
two vector fields U µ and V µ,
[U, V ]µ
T ≡U α∇αV µ −V α∇αU µ
= [U, V ]µ + T αβ
µU αV β .
(40)
Evaluated in vicinity of a point x0, as pointed out by
Hehl & Obukhov [19, 20], this gives rise to what we shall
refer to as the “canonical” visualization of torsion in the
presence of two fiducial vector field U µ and V µ. This
visualization is local in nature, and is depicted schemat-
ically in Fig. 1.
Now we are ready to apply the canonical visualization
to our examples (35)–(37), where for simplicity we will
focus on the two fiducial vector fields
U µ = (1, 0) ,
V µ = (0, 1) .
(41)
However, we emphasize that this visualization holds for
any choice of vector fields, but the visual correspondence
of T αβµU αV β to the torsion background field T txµ will
be somewhat obfuscated. That being said, the results for
the above choice is shown in Fig. 2.

FIG. 1. We sketch the canonical visualization of an infinites-
imal parallelogram (shaded grey) spanned by the vectors U
and V at the point x0. The subscripts on quantities denote
whether they are to be evaluated at the point x0 or the in-
finitesimally close points x1 or x2.
The quantities U ||
0 and
V ||
0 denote the parallel propagated vectors along each other.
The abbreviation T(U, V ) stands for the vector T αβ
µU αV β.
The grey arrows connect this infinitesimal parallelogram to
the commutator of the two vector fields.
