Brownian bridge above a curve
73
Proof. The equality (A.1) is standard and follows by the reflection principle. The bounds in (A.2)
follows by the elementary inequalities x −x2/2 ≤1 −e−x ≤x which are valid for x ≥0. To get
(A.3), it suffices to note that, for s ∈[0, b],
Px,u,b(τ0 > s, τ0 ≤b) =
Z ∞
0
Px,y,s(τ0 > s)Px,u,b(Bs ∈dy) .
Since the density Px,u,b(Bs ∈dy) is the same as that of a normal random variable with mean
x + s(u −x)/b and variance s(b −s)/b and by using the exact identity (A.1), the result follows by
differentiation.
Lemma A.2. For b > 0, consider Mb
def= infr∈[0,b] Br and Tb
def= sup{r ∈[0, b] : Br = Mb}. Then,
for u > 0, it holds that
P0,u,b(Tb ∈ds, Mb ∈dz) =

(A.4)
Proof. The proof is inspired by the proof of [BL18, Lemma A.1]. Using the path continuity and the
strong Markov property of the Brownian bridge, along with the exact identity (A.1), we note that for
any s ∈[0, b] and z ≤0, it holds that
P0,u,b(Tb ≤s, Mb ≤z) = lim

and so the claim follows by using (A.3) and by differentiation.
Lemma A.3. Let b ≥1 and x ≥1. For all u ∈[0, b3/4] and s ∈[1, b], it holds that
Px,u,b(τ0 > s) ≤2x2

(A.5)
Proof. Fix b ≥1, x ≥1, and u ∈[0, b3/4]. As we have observed in the proof of Lemma A.1, for any
s ∈[1, b], by conditioning on the value of the Brownian bridge at times s, we can write
Px,u,b(τ0 > s) =
Z ∞
0
Px,y,s(τ0 > s)Px,u,b(Bs ∈dy) ,
where, as one can easily check, the density Px,u,b(Bs ∈dy) is that of a normal random variable with
mean x + s(u −x)/b and variance s(b −s)/b, i.e.,
Px,u,b(Bs ∈dy) =

Therefore, for s ∈[1, b], by letting

def= x + s(u −x)
