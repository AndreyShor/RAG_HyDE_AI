Secure quantum communication traditionally assumes that the adversary controls only the public
channel. We consider a more powerful adversary who can demand private information of users.
This type of adversary has been studied in public key cryptography in recent years, initiated by
Persiano, Phan, and Yung at Eurocrypt 2022. We introduce a similar attacker to quantum com-
munication, referring to it as the controller. The controller is a quantum computer that controls
the entire communication infrastructure, including both classical and quantum channels. It can
even ban classical public key cryptography and post-quantum public key cryptography, leaving only
quantum cryptography and post-quantum symmetric key cryptography as the remaining options.
We demonstrate how such a controller can control quantum communication and how users can
achieve covert communication under its control.

INTRODUCTION
Quantum mechanics changes our understanding of in-
formation and security [1].
Unlike classical security,
which relies on computational complexity [2, 3], quantum
security is based on the fundamental laws of physics. The
core principles of quantum mechanics—superposition,
entanglement, uncertainty, wavefunction collapse, and
no-cloning—form the foundation of secure quantum com-
munication.
Superposition [4] allows a photon to encode informa-
tion in multiple quantum states simultaneously, similar
to how a qubit can embody both 0 and 1 at the same
time. This capability improves the eﬃciency and secu-
rity of quantum information transmission by allowing for
denser data encoding and more robust encryption meth-
ods.
Entanglement [5, 6] establishes a strong correlation be-
tween quantum particles. When one particle’s state is
measured, the state of its entangled partner is instanta-
neously determined, regardless of the distance between
them.
This principle enables secure remote agreement
on photon states, making any unauthorized measurement
immediately detectable.
Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle [7] states that mea-
suring certain conjugate properties (such as position and
momentum, or energy and time) of a quantum system
will inevitably disturb the system. This inherent distur-
bance exposes any interception or interference.
Wavefunction collapse [8] happens when a quantum
system is measured, forcing it into a single state and
destroying the original superposition. This makes eaves-
dropping impossible, as the act of measurement collapses
the state of the system.
The no-cloning theorem [4, 9] asserts that it is impossi-
ble to create an exact copy of an unknown quantum state.
This safeguards data from duplication during transmis-
sion.

Together, these principles form the foundation of quan-
tum communication, providing security based on the fun-
damental laws of quantum mechanics rather than com-
putation theory.
However, security is never unconditional, it always de-
pends on the assumed capacities of the adversary.
Classical public key cryptography [10, 11] relies on
computational problems like discrete logarithms [10] and
factoring [11] . These problems are secure against clas-
sical adversaries but are vulnerable to quantum attacks
[12, 13].
Post-quantum cryptography [14, 15] uses computa-
tional problems that are believed to resist quantum at-
tacks. While it aims to develop algorithms that remain
secure in the quantum era, its implementation is classical,
and it still relies on computational complexity without
taking advantage of quantum mechanics.
Quantum cryptography [16–18], however, directly ex-
ploits quantum principles for secure communication. It
resists both classical and quantum adversaries. Unlike
classical and post-quantum cryptography, it does not de-
pend on computational assumptions.
Early quantum protocols, such as BB84 [19] and E91
[20], are designed to resists quantum eavesdroppers who
can intercept, manipulate, and exploit entanglement.
However, this model of adversary may not cover all future
threats in quantum networks.
A physically more powerful adversary was studied in
[21].
Unlike typical adversaries who might attempt to
eavesdrop or tamper with the signal, this adversary ex-
ploits inherent channel imperfections to extract informa-
tion. By leveraging channel noise, it can detect covert
communication while passively monitoring transmissions
without actively interfering.
However, the strength of
this adversary lies more in its physical capabilities rather
than conceptual innovations.
It remains an adversary
that only focus on controlling the public channel without
demanding private data from users.
In recent years, a conceptually super powerful adver-
sary known as the dictator [22–24] has been considered
in public key cryptography. In contrast to traditional ad-
versaries, this adversary can demand user private keys,
