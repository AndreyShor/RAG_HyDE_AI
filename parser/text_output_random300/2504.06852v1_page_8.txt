In Subsec. II D 2, we have discussed that magnon en-
ergy photoconductivity under the condition of low optical
frequency and Γ = 0 (Eq. 22) can not be expressed as the
weighted integral of Berry curvature with respect to Bose
distribution. However, according to Eq. 34, the sum of
two bands is a constant. So Eq. 22 can be expressed as

in the model of ferromagnetic Hexagonal lattice. Here,
d0 = ∆= 3JS + gJµBBz is independent to D, but is
dependent to J.
So the relationship between χE,e
ab (ωi)
and D is similar to that between χe
ab(ωi) and D.
According Eq. 34 and Eq. 35, when D > 0 meV, the
Chern number set of the ferromagnetic Hexagonal lattice
satisfies (C−, C+) = (1, −1), in which C−is the Chern
number of the lower band and C+ is the Chern nember
of the higher band (detal see Appendix F). When D < 0
meV, the Chern number satisfies (C−, C+) = (−1, 1).
Therefore, exchange interaction J, magnetic field Bz
have no effect on the Chern number of magnon system.
Because Bose distribution f B
n (ε) =
1
eε/kBT −1 decreases
with increasing energy ε, magnons are more widely dis-
tributed in the lower band ε−(k). Therefore, according
to Eq. 18, we can control the direction of the magnon
optical-transport by changing the direction of the DM
interaction roughly.
In order to discuss this problem
more concretely, we introduce the Chern number isoen-
ergy surfaces40

For D > 0 meV, as shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b), C−(ε) >
0 meV and C+(ε) < 0. And because of the expression of
Berry curvature (Eq. E9), the main contributions to the
Chern numbers appear at the band edges with the small-
est energy gap. According to Eq. 18, χe
xx(ω) is roughly
given by the Chern numbers weight by Bose distribu-
tion. And because the Bose distribution decreases with
the increase of energy, the Chern number of lower band
has a greater contribution to the magnon spin photocon-
ductivity (Fig.
4 (c)).
Therefore, when D > 0 meV,
(i/νωa2)χe
xx(ω) > 0 and (i/d0νωa2)χE,e
xx (ω) > 0. In a
similar way, for D < 0 meV, because the change of Chern
numbers, (i/νωa2)χe
xx(ω) < 0 and (i/d0νωa2)χE,e
xx (ω) <
0. To sum up, D can be used to control the symbol of
χe
xx(ω) and χE,e
xx (ω). According to Eq. 31, the change
of the sign of D will change the direction of MSPC and
MEPC.
From another point of view, we can control the mag-
nitude of χe
xx(ω) and χE,e
xx (ω) by changing DM D. As
shown in Fig. 4 (c) and (f), Chern numbers of different
bands have opposite sign, leading to a partial cancellation
in the total magnon spin (energy) photoconductivity40.
Roughly speaking, because Bose distribution decreases
with the increase of energy, the effect of the partial can-
cellation can be reduced by increasing the energy differ-
ence of bands. According to Eq. 34 and the expression
of d(k), we can increase the magnitude of D (|D|) to
increase the different of bands. Therefore, we can hope-
fully increase the magnitude of χe
xx(ω) and χE,e
xx (ω) by
increasing |D|. In other words, under the condition of
low optical frequency and Γ = 0, the magnitude of MSPC
and MEPC (Eq. 31) can be increased by increasing the
|D|.
The calculation results of magnon spin (energy) pho-
toconductivity in Hexagonal lattice are shown in Fig. 5.
In Fig.
5 (b), as mentioned earlier, when the sign of
D is reversed, the sign of the Chern number is also re-
versed. So in Fig. 5 (c), the reversing of D reverses the
sign of magnon spin (energy) photoconductivity. When
D = 0 meV, the magnon spin (energy) photoconductiv-
ity is zero because of the ETRS ˆT (detail see Sec. III).
And in Fig. 5 (a) , the band difference around points K
and K′ increase with the increasing of |D|. Therefore, in
Fig. 5 (c), the magnitude of magnon spin (energy) pho-
toconductivity increase with |D|. And as shown in Fig.
5 (d), the magnitude of magnon spin (energy) photocon-
ductivity increases with the increasing of temperature,
because the increasing temperature can excite more spin
vibrations.
