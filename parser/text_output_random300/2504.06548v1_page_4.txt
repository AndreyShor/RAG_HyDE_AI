Exchange Energy
The exchange energy is essentially short range, and it in-
volves a summation over nearest neighbors. If we assume
a small spatial variation of the magnetization at the meso-
scopic length scale, the exchange energy density can be writ-
ten as41–43

where A is the exchange stiffness constant in J/m (SI units).

Anisotropy Energy
Anisotropy refers to the directional dependence of magnetic
material properties, playing a crucial role in the magnetic re-
versal mechanism and holding significant fundamental impor-
tance. There are several anisotropy energy terms relevant for
thin film magnetism. A brief overview is given in the follow-
ing.
a.
Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Energy:
The Magne-
tocrystalline anisotropy energy has its origin at the atomic
level. In materials exhibiting significant anisotropy, there ex-
ists a robust coupling between the spin and orbital angular mo-
menta within individual atoms due to spin-orbit coupling. Ad-
ditionally, atomic orbitals, which are typically non-spherical,
exhibit strong interactions with the lattice. Due to their shape,
these orbitals tend to align preferentially along specific crys-
tallographic directions. Consequently, the interplay between
spin-orbit and orbit-lattice coupling dictates a preferred align-
ment for the magnetization, known as the easy direction. The
energy required to deviate the magnetization from this pref-
erential orientation is termed magnetocrystalline anisotropy
energy. Given the diverse lattice structures present in mate-
rials, it is natural to anticipate that this anisotropy energy is
dependent on the lattice structure.
Uniaxial Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy occurs in hexag-
onal crystals, such as cobalt. Phenomenologically one can
write the energy expression as36
EUniaxial = KuVsin2θ,
(10)
where θ is the angle between the easy direction and the
magnetization, Ku is the anisotropy constant in units of en-
ergy/volume, and V is the volume of the sample.
Cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy occurs in cubic crys-
tals, such as iron and nickel. Phenomenologically, one can
write the energy expression as36–38,41
ECubic = KoV +K1V(α2
1 α2
2 +α2
2 α2
3 +α2
3 α2
1 )
(11)
Here, the αi represent the cosines of the angles between the
magnetization direction and the crystal axes.
b.
Shape Anisotropy Energy
The shape anisotropy en-
ergy arises from the tendency of a FM to align its magnetic
moments along certain preferred directions due to its shape.
In the case of a two-dimensional nanowire, the demagnetizing
factors are lower along the long axis compared to the short
axis. This means that it is easier to magnetize the nanowire
with an in-plane external field applied along the long axis,
leading to an induced anisotropy known as shape anisotropy.
The shape anisotropy energy increases as demagnetizing field
⃗HD increases. A common phenomenological expression for
the shape anisotropy energy for an ellipsoidal ferromagnet is
given by:
EUniaxial = KDV sin2 θ.
(12)
Here, θ is the angle between the long axis of the sample and
the magnetization direction. The anisotropy constant is KD =
1
2(Nx −Nz)M2, where Nx and Nz are demagnetization factors
in the short and long axis direction, respectively.
While various anisotropy energy terms exist,
shape
anisotropy dominates artificial spin ice dynamics. This prefer-
ence arises because the patterned thin films from which ASIs
are made are typically polycrystalline, with individual grains
of the magnetic film (e.g., a NiFe thin film on a thermally oxi-
dized Si substrate, with no perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
and random grain orientation). In such a case, the influence
of magnetocrystalline anisotropy is expected to be negligible
compared to shape anisotropy.
B.
Micromagnetic Simulations
Advances in computational hardware and numerical tech-
niques enable the implementation of the micromagnetic ap-
proach described above on both high-performance computing
facilities and standard office desktop computers, utilizing ei-
ther CPU or GPU processing.
The key advantages of this micromagnetic simulations
(MS) approach are as follows:
1. Replicating Experimental Observations: MS accu-
rately replicate experimental phenomena such as FM
hysteresis and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectra,
providing a virtual laboratory for validation and explo-
ration.
2. Deciphering Parameter Influences: By exploring the
dependence of experimental outcomes (e.g., coercivity,
resonance frequency) on simulation parameters like the
exchange length of the FM, MS facilitates a nuanced
understanding of these relationships, guiding experi-
mental design and interpretation.
3. Optimizing Future Experiments: MS empower re-
searchers to fine-tune physical parameters for upcom-
ing experiments, enhancing efficiency and efficacy by
iteratively refining hypotheses and experimental setups.
A finite difference method (FDM) based program called Ob-
ject Oriented Micromagnetic Framework (OOMMF) can be
used to perform MS44. The geometry of an object needs to be
first discretized in the form of cuboid spins of sizes p nm × q
