Next, we expand δ ˜f in spherical harmonics as
δ ˜f(ρ, θ, ϕ) =
X
l,m
alm(ρ)Y m
l (θ, ϕ) ,
(4.18)
where alm = 0 whenever l −m is even; this enforces the premise that δ ˜f vanishes on the boundary
when θ →π/2 with ρ > 0 fixed. On the other hand, the series has to vanish when ρ →0 with
θ ∈(0, π/2) fixed, from which (using Dominated Convergence) we have that alm(0) = 0 for all l, m.
Moreover, since we found above that ∇δf(x, y, 0) = 0, we have
∂ρδ ˜f(ρ, θ, ϕ) = ∂ρδf(x, y, z) = (sin θ cos ϕ, sin θ sin ϕ, cos θ) · ∇δf(x, y, z) →0 ,
