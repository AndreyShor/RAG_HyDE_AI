Tools and methodology
• Collider gauge boson plus jets. Among the available measurements, we consider
differential distributions of W-boson production with Njets ≥1 from ATLAS [197]. We
select the distribution differential in the transverse momentum of the W boson, pW
T .
Theoretical predictions are determined at NLO, with MCFM, while NNLO, QCD corrections
are implemented by means of K-factors [198, 199].
• Single inclusive jet and dijet production. Measurements of single inclusive jet
production comprehend differential distributions in the transverse momentum, pjet
T , and
of the rapidity, yjet, of the jet from ATLAS [200] and CMS [201]. For dijet production
instead we consider double differential in the dijet invariant mass mjj and in the absolute
difference of the rapidities of the two jets y∗from ATLAS [202, 203] and CMS [204, 205].
The accompanying predictions are computed with nnlojet [145] at full NLO with NNLO
K-factors.
• Top quark pair production. We include differential cross-section in the top pair rapid-
ity and/or invariant mass from ATLAS [206, 207, 208, 209] and CMS [210, 211, 212, 213].
We use Mg5aMC@NLO to compute NLO predictions and NNLO corrections are determined
from publicly available FastNLO tables [214, 215].
• Single top quark production. We consider data from ATLAS [216, 217, 218] and
CMS [219, 220, 221]. These encompass ratio of the top to antitop inclusive cross-sections,
differential distributions in the top or antitop quark rapidity and sum of top and antitop
inclusive cross-sections. Similarly to t¯t data we compute predictions with Mg5aMC@NLO at
NLO and account for NNLO effects with K-factors as in Refs. [222, 223].
• Direct Photon production. In this category, we select the ATLAS measurements [224,
225]. The measurements are provided for the cross-section differential in the photon
transverse energy Eγ
T in different bins of the photon pseudorapidity ηγ and compared to
theoretical predictions from MCFM. NNLO QCD corrections are incorporated by means of
the K-factors computed in [226]
Whenever possible, all the experimental correlations are taken into account and we select
observables that are less affected by higher order corrections. For DIS data, we apply the
kinematic cuts on Q2 ≥3.5 GeV2 and W 2 ≥12.5 GeV2, assuming that outside this region,
higher-twist effects might become relevant. For the hadronic dataset, the precise adopted
cuts are listed in [109, Tab. 4.1]. These aim to remove specific points for which the K-factor
approach is poorly reliable due to numerical instabilities, the electroweak corrections are
relevant, for instance in the large mass tails of the DY distributions or, resummation effects are
large, as in the small-pT regions. If correlations are not available, the dijet data are preferred
over the single jet measurements. The total number of datapoints included in the baseline is
therefore 4426 at NLO and 4618 at NNLO.
Approximately 30 % of the data points listed above involve measurements on deuterium and
heavy nuclear targets, but in our analysis we aim to determine a proton PDF. In order to take
