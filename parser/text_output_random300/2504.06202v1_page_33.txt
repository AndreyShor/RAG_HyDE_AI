Proof of the upper bound in (1.7). We will prove that for 1 > r > ε > 0,
P[W+
4 (ε, r)] ≲εξ+
4 (κ),
(6.21)
where the implicit constant depends on κ, r. Suppose that η is a chordal SLEκ in H from 0 to ∞.
For y > x > 1, let eη be the image of η under the conformal map f(z) = (xyz −xy)/(−xz +y). Then
eη is a SLEκ in H from −x to −y. Note that f sends the half circle ∂Br(1) ∩H (resp. ∂Bε(1) ∩H)
to the half circle with endpoints f(1 −r) and f(1 + r) (resp. f(1 −ε) and f(1 + ε)). Let
r0 := min(|f(1 −r)|, |f(1 + r)|) =
xy
y −x(1 −r)r, ε0 = max(|f(1 −ε)|, |f(1 + ε)|) =
xy
y −x(1 + ε)ε.
Note that r0 ≥r. If W+
4 (ε, r) occurs for η, then f
W+
4 (x, y, ε0, r) occurs for eη. For ε sufficiently
small, we have ε0 ≤2εxy/(y−x). Let x := x0 and y := y0 for x0, y0 chosen according to Lemma 6.5
for s = r. Then we have
P

4 (ε, r)
 ≤P
 f
W+
4 (x0, y0, ε0, r)
 ≲εξ+
4 (κ),
where the implicit constant depends on κ, r. This completes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 1.3. First, observe that the upper bound in (1.8) is proved in Section 6.2, while
the upper bound in (1.7) is proved earlier in this section.
As for the lower bound in (1.7), note that Hα
3 (ε, 1, −4, 1) is contained in W+
4 (ε, r) for all 1 >
r > ε > 0. Then (6.5) implies that P[W+
4 (ε, r)] ≳εξ+
4 , where the implicit constant depends only
on κ.
In order to get the lower bound in (1.8), we send D onto H by the unique conformal map f
which sends 1, a to 0, ∞with |f′(0)| = 1. Let z = f(0). Let η be an SLEκ in H from 0 to ∞. Let
R > 0 be the constant in Proposition 6.2 and let F be the event defined therein. We can choose
y sufficiently large, so that y > 404R and BR(y) ∩f(Br) = ∅. By Koebe 1/4 theorem, we also
have Bε/4(z) ⊆f(Bε). Therefore, if the event E4(ε/4, z, y, R)∩F holds for η, then W4(a, ε, r) holds
for f−1(η). Then (6.9) implies that P[W4(a, ε, r)] ≳εξ4, where the implicit constant depends on
κ, a, r.
