where ea⋆> 0 is the constant introduced in Proposition 2.17.
Remark 6.6. The previous lemma entails almost directly that the measure eµγ,s,t converges to an
integrated atomic random measure with parameter γ and spatial intensity given by the Lebesgue
measure dx, i.e, up to multiplicative constants and recalling the notation introduce in Definition 1.5,
to Pγ[dx]. To see this, it suffices to take the function χ to be of constant order. Then, taking first the
limit when t →∞and then the limit when s →∞, the “log corrections” appearing in (6.13) vanish,
and one can read off the Laplace functional associated to measure described above. Since we don’t
need this fact in the sequel of the proof, we refrain from giving further details.
In the next lemma we compute the conditional Laplace functionals of the measures (µγ,t)t≥0.
Lemma 6.7. There exists a diverging sequence (sn)n≥0 of non-negative real numbers such that,
almost surely,

where ea⋆> 0 is the constant introduced in Proposition 2.17, and µγc is the critical GMC.
Proof. In order to prove the result, we rely on Corollary 6.5. In particular, we want to take the function
χ : [0, 1]d →R in that corollary in such a way that exp(−γχ(x))eµγ,s,t(dx) = µγ,t(dx), which forces
us to take

Now, a simple computation yields that, for χ as in (6.18),
ρχ,s(dx) = µγc,s(dx) ,
where here we recall (1.7). For ε > 0, s ≥0, R ≥1 such that (es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N, and χ as in
(6.18), we consider the following events
