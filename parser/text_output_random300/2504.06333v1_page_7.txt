The obvious issue with trying to apply the setup described above is that in this
case we do not have all of the tools of group cohomology at our disposal – mainly,
we do not have a cohomological (or otherwise) classiﬁcation of ‘extensions’ that
result in fusion categorical symmetries. As a result, we’ll look for an alternative
description of this phenomenon that will be more amenable to generalization.

Example: Anomalous Z2 extended to Z4
As the simplest example of the above construction, let us begin with an anoma-
lous Z2 symmetry, described by the non-trivial class α ∈H3(Z2,U(1)) = Z2. As
described in e.g. [5, section 4.1.1], a simple set of choices for the resolution is to
take
1. an extension of G = Z2 by K = Z2 to Γ = Z4,
2. take the mixed anomaly or “quantum symmetry phase” β ∈H2(G, ˆK) =
H1(Z2,Z2) = Z2 to be the nontrivial element.
It is straightforward to check that with these choices, c ∪β = α. Note that non-
degeneracy of the cup product requires that the extension class in H2(Z2,Z2) = Z2
be nontrivial, which is consistent with the choice Γ = Z4. There is then a non-
trivial mixed anomaly valued in H1(Z2,Z2) = Z2 between the original, anomalous
Z2 symmetry and the extending, trivially-acting Z2.
2.3
Relative phases and mixed anomalies
As just reviewed, in the previous papers [3–6], to implement the Wang-Wen-Witten
anomaly cancellation [1], in addition to enlarging the gauge group, one also turns
on ‘relative’ phases (“quantum symmetries”), analogous to discrete torsion. In
an orbifold [X/Γ], these phases arise when a central subgroup K ⊂Γ acts triv-
ially. They are are classiﬁed by elements of H1(G, ˆK), where G = Γ/K. In the
application to anomaly resolution, they are chosen so that the image of
d2 ∶H1(G, ˆK) Ð→H3(G,U(1))
(2.9)
is the anomaly.
Let us review these relative phases in more detail.
The idea is that these
deﬁne relative phases between contributions to the orbifold that would otherwise
be identical. For example, since K acts trivially, ordinarily one has
