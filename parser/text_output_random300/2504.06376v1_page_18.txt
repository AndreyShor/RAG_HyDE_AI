A Lower bound for Quantum Convex Hulls
In this appendix, we show that our algorithm is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors
assuming a sorted input and oracle access to the data. A key ingredient of this proof is the
lower-bound on unstructured search given oracle access to a database, summarized below.
▶Theorem 9. Let S be a set of size N and f : S →{0, 1} be a Boolean function such that
f(x) = 1 for a unique x ∈S and Uin be a unitary providing oracle access to f. Then, to find
x, a quantum computer requires at least Ω
√
N

queries to Uin.
For the lower bound, we consider a lexicographically sorted set of n points whose convex
hull contains h + 1 points lying on a parabola, and h points lying above that parabola. We
also assume a setting where the points on the convex hull appear every n/h points, which we
will call partition points. Furthermore, there will be a point on the convex hull between every
pair of partition points. What remains is to find these remaining points on the convex hull.
This problem reduces to finding the nearest point to the parabola below the chord formed by
consecutive partition points. By Theorem 9, if each block has a unique winner to be found,
we require at least Ω
p
n/h

queries to find a winner per block. Since there are h blocks,
we see that we require Ω
√

queries to the oracle to find the convex hull. (See Figure 7).
Figure 7 A set of n = 19 points with 7 points on the convex hull. There are h + 1 = 4 points
that lie on the parabola (in green) assumed to be given to us, and h points on the convex hull lying
between the chords and parabola. Now the objective is to find within each block, the point marked
in black.
