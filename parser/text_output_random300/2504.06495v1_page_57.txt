so we must have:

⇒

1 −ε,
which indeed satisﬁes η > 1.
# Solving for α and c0: From the eigenvalue relation for η, we have:
1
1 −ε = −eµ +
p
eµ2 + 2σ2λ0
σ2
⇒
λ0 =
σ2
2(1 −ε)2 +
eµ
1 −ε.
This principal eigenvalue governs the survival decay rate and thus the asymptotic growth of
the conditional expectation. The growth rate of bτ is then:
log α = dbτ
dτ =
σ2
1 −ε −eµ.
To determine c0, recall that initially Φ0 = φ0 and thus ξ0 = ε · φ0. Matching with the Ansatz
ξ0 = c0 · α0 gives:
c0 = ε · φ0
1 −ε.
# Uniqueness and conclusion: The map ξ 7→ε · E[Φτ | Φτ > ξ] is continuous and strictly
increasing, ensuring uniqueness of the ﬁxed point ξτ at each τ. Hence, we conclude:
ξτ = c0 · ατ · (1 + o(1)),
with
log α =
σ2
1 −ε −eµ,
so that:
lim
τ→∞
log(ξτ/c0)
τ
= log α,
as claimed.
