TM and 0.0247 for Si–TE. This performance discrepancy directly reflects the underlying spectral 
behavior that Ti spectra exhibit smooth, broadband intensity variations with minimal resonant 
structure, allowing PCA-based linear regression to effectively capture the index-dependent 
variation. In contrast, Si spectra are dominated by sharp Mie-type resonances that make the 
intensity shift nonlinearly with index, making them less compatible with global linear modeling. 
Figure 7(b) illustrates the fold enhancement in MSE obtained by transitioning from the best 
single-feature linear model to full-spectrum PCA-based regression. The Ti–TM dataset shows a 
6065-fold reduction in error, followed by Ti–TE with a 598.8-fold improvement. For the Si–TE 
and Si–TM datasets, the enhancements are more modest (22.8 and 4.3-fold, respectively), 
reflecting the fact that much of the predictive information in resonance-dominated spectra is 
already concentrated in a small number of well-aligned peak features. 
Figure 7(c) shows the baseline MSEs of the best individual peak predictors: 0.4017 for Ti–TM, 
0.0628 for Ti–TE, 0.0294 for Si–TM, and 0.5629 for Si–TE. Notably, while Si–TM yields the 
lowest single-feature error among the four, its full-spectrum model improves only marginally. This 
suggests that, despite spectral richness, the nonlinear behavior of its intensity variation limits the 
effectiveness of linear PCA-based modeling. In contrast, Ti-based datasets benefit substantially 
from this approach due to their linear and distributed spectral response. 
To validate the use of linear regression, a comparison was performed using multiple machine 
learning algorithms, including Lasso, support vector regression, random forest, and gradient 
boosting, on the Ti–TE dataset. Linear regression achieved the lowest MSE and was therefore 
selected for all four datasets to ensure consistency and interpretability. Although the comparison 
was limited to a representative dataset, the spectral behavior and resulting trends across 
configurations confirm the appropriateness of the chosen model. 
Figure 8 presents the residual plots of the full-spectrum principal component regression (PCR) 
models across all four datasets, plotted as the difference between the predicted and true target 
variables against the true target values (index samples from 1.3 to 1.4 with 0.01 steps mapped onto 
1 to 101 with 1 seps). These visualizations offer a direct interpretation of prediction error 
distributions and provide further insight into the compatibility between spectral behavior and linear 
modeling.
