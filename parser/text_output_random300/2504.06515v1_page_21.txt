5.4.1. Neutral Particle Motion
For electrically neutral particles, with e1 = e2 = 0, the quantity Λe = −2Λ. In this case,
the gravitational attraction of the masses competes with cosmic expansion or attraction,
depending on the sign of Λe.
It is instructive to examine the motion for a range of masses. To this end, an arbitrary
ﬁducial mass m0 can be chosen, which sets a calibration scale for all other quantities. Typical
scenarios are illustrated in Figures 4 and 5.
For Λe < 0, the curvature R < 0 in the absence of stress–energy (from (14)) corre-
sponding to cosmic attraction is depicted in Figure 4. The particles always remain bound,
and for large values of m, undergo oscillation about their centre of inertia in a manner
not too different from that shown in Figure 2 for small H0. However, for very small m, a
rather surprising situation arises: a sharp extremum develops early in each half-period
followed by a second, broader extremum. The ﬁrst extremum is visible in Figure 4 for the
m = 0.05m0 curve, but also appears for smaller values of m; it is not visible for m = 0.001m0
due to plotting precision.
In all cases, in Figure 4, the two particles start at r = 0 with equal opposing momentum
and depart in opposite directions. For a small enough m, they quickly reach a maximum
separation and then go back toward one another for a certain period of proper time. At some
point, they each reverse direction, moving apart more slowly until they attain a second
maximal separation. They then reverse direction again, returning to their starting point
where the motion then repeats itself with the particles interchanged.
