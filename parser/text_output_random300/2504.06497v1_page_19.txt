Conclusion
This study explored the impact of different data encoding techniques, including Classical, IQP,
Displacement, and Squeezing, on the performance of various machine learning models across
multiple PCA dimensions. The results indicate that encoding strategies significantly influence
classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and model behavior. PCA dimensionality re-
duction consistently improves model performance, with PCA=23 yielding the highest accuracy
across most scenarios. However, the choice of encoding plays a crucial role, as IQP encoding
consistently underperforms, while Displacement and Squeezing encodings demonstrate notable
improvements.
Despite their potential, quantum encoding techniques introduce computational overhead, partic-
ularly in high-dimensional feature spaces. While certain quantum encodings improve classifica-
tion accuracy, their feasibility in practical applications depends on optimizing computational ef-
ficiency. The findings emphasize the need for further investigation into hybrid quantum-classical
models to balance accuracy and efficiency. Future research should focus on refining encoding
mechanisms, exploring alternative feature selection techniques, and leveraging quantum advan-
tage in real-world predictive modeling tasks.
