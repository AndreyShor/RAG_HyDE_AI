Abstract. Using the well known approach developed in the papers of B.Davies and his co-authors
we obtain inequalities for the location of possible complex eigenvalues of non-selfadjoint func-
tional difference operators. When studying the sharpness of the main result we discovered that
complex potentials can create resonances.
1. INTRODUCTION
In this paper we are concerned with possible locations of eigenvalues of non-
selfadjoint functional difference operators with complex-valued potentials.
Let P be the self-adjoint quantum mechanical momentum operator on L2(R),
i.e. P = i d
dx and for b > 0 denote by U(b) the Weyl operator U(b) = exp(−bP).
By using the Fourier transform
bψ(k) = (Fψ)(k) =
Z
R
e−2πikxψ(x) dx
we can describe the domain of U(b) as
dom(U(b)) =

ψ ∈L2(R) : e−2πbk bψ(k) ∈L2(R)

.
This set consists of those functions ψ(x) that admit an analytic continuation to
the strip {z = x + iy ∈C : 0 < y < b} such that ψ(x + iy) ∈L2(R) for all
0 ≤y < b and there is a limit ψ(x + ib −i0) = limε→0+ ψ(x + ib −iε) in the
sense of convergence in L2(R), which we will denote simply by ψ(x + ib). The
domain of the inverse operator U−1(b) can be characterised similarly.
For b > 0 we define the operator W0(b) = U(b)+U(b)−1 = 2 cosh(bP) on the
domain
dom(W0(b)) =

ψ ∈L2(R) : 2 cosh(2πbk)bψ(k) ∈L2(R)

.
The operator W0(b) is self-adjoint and unitarily equivalent to the multiplication
operator 2 cosh(2πbk) in the Fourier space. Its spectrum is thus absolutely con-
tinuous covering the interval [2, ∞) doubly.
