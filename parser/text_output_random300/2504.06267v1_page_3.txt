(a) Time dependence of the spin and photon effective
temperatures starting from the initial condition |ψ0⟩= |0, 0.2π⟩⊗
|0, 0.8π⟩⊗|0⟩.
The parameters are taken as (∆, λ) = (−0.1, 0.5)
and g = 0.5, 0.25, and 0.15 for regimes I, II, and III, respectively
(N = 200). All the quantities are measured in units of ω0 = 1. The
semitransparent ribbons represent the uncertainty arising from aver-
aging Teff over small frequency and time windows according to the
procedure detailed in [102]. Initially large, temperature deviations
gradually vanish, signaling a transition to the regime where the no-
tion of effective temperatures becomes reliable. (b) Spin and photon
effective time temperatures taken at time τ = 140, and displayed as a
function of the Dicke coupling g (we mark this time in panel (a) by
the vertical black dashed line). The gray vertical lines indicate the
values of g used in the respective regimes in (a).
respectively. This enables us to explore potential prethermal
regimes, where one subsystem thermalizes before the other,
or where the two degrees of freedom prethermalize at differ-
ent temperatures. In this work, the effective temperature for
spin degrees of freedom is defined with respect to local spin-z
correlation functions. For more details on the numerical ex-
traction procedure of Tph and Ts, we refer to [102].
Thermalization dynamics
In Fig. 2(a), we show the time
dependence of the low-frequency effective temperatures for
three choices of parameters starting from the same initial con-
dition |ψ0⟩= |0, 0.2π⟩⊗|0, 0.8π⟩⊗|0⟩. The system is taken
on a two-dimensional square lattice, with 10 × 10 spins on
each of the two sublattices.
Using the freedom to choose
the units of energy/time, we set ω0 = 1. Accordingly, all

FIG. 3. Plots of observables for the same initial conditions and values
of coupling constants as in Fig. 2. (a) Time dependence of the photon
coherence (top) and of the staggered magnetization (bottom). Gray
dashed lines mark the onset of (pre)thermalization as extracted from

τ = 140 across the three dynamical regimes. In regime III, the spin
spectral function is inverted at low frequencies, signaling a negative

quantities presented in the following are assumed to be mea-
sured in units of ω0. The remaining parameters are taken as
(κ, ∆, λ) = (0.0, −0.1, 0.5) and g = 0.5, 0.25, and 0.15 for three
regimes, labeled I, II, and III. The effect of photon losses is
negligible for times τ ≲1/κ, as we have confirmed numer-
ically. At long times, dynamics settle on a nonequilibrium
steady state, which has been characterized at the mean-field
level in Ref. [73] and which could get enriched upon includ-
ing fluctuations, as we plan to explore in forthcoming work.
Regime I is characterized by strong long-range interactions;
the system demonstrates fast thermalization, with matter and
light quickly reaching the same temperature. From the Hamil-
tonian perspective, this regime can be considered as a per-
turbed Dicke model in the superradiant phase, which is known
to show fast effective thermalization [117–119]. According to
Fig. 3a, the photon coherence decays with time in regime I.
This decay arises from finite-size effects [94] and fluctuations
induced by the Rydberg interactions. Notably, it does not im-
ply the destruction of superradiance. The presence of a super-
radiant state is manifested by the scaling of photon two-point
functions with the system size, ⟨a2⟩∼N. A further hallmark
of superradiance is the critical spectrum of photons (upper left
panel of Fig. 3b), with a pronounced peak at ω →0 due
to strong hybridization and entanglement between spins and
photons [72, 114, 120]. The low-frequency peak also signals
