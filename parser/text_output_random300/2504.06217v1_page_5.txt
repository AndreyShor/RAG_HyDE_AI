FIG. 3. Chernoff information difference. A. We plot ∆ξ :=
ξ(A) −ξ(E), defining effective covertness as a function of the
mean number of signal photons µS. The parameters are the
same of Fig.(2), with either ηE = 1 (solid lines), or ηE = 0.3
(dashed lines). B. ∆ξ for the quantum probe and different
values of background. The other parameters are the same of
the previous panel with ηE = 1.
On the other hand, Eve’ performance is always given by:
ξ(E) ≈1

the signal photons, µB ≫µ.
This ap-
proximation steams from the fact that in the regime
µB ≫µ, the optimization in Eq.(12) is solved for α ≈1/2
[9, 20, 34].
Alice’s classical sensing, at a fixed number of total
probe photons, can be improved, in principle, by send-
ing less modes, and thus collecting less background noise.
In the covert scenario, however, this strategy is not nec-
essarily convenient, as this improvement would come at
the cost of an increased probability of detection by Eve.
Recalling that perr ∝e−Mξ when using M copies of
the probe state, we qualitatively analyze the alternative
strategy with a large number of photons in a single mode

FIG. 4. Asymptotic probabilities of error. We plot the asymp-
totic probabilities of error (in log scale) in the limit of a large
number of modes M. The parameters are the same of the
previous figures and we fix µs = 0.001. In panel A ηE = 1,

number of photons per mode.
In Fig. 4 we study the
performance of this this alternative strategy for covert
sensing, showing that it is close to the one obtained by
spreading the photons in different modes.
In view of
this, in the remaining part of the manuscript we consider
the latter as the main classical reference, though we will
study both quantities.
Having defined the classical benchmark, we compare
it with a quantum probe ρqua = (|TMSV⟩⟨TMSV|)⊗R
composed of a collection of two-mode squeezed vacuum
states, where |TMSV⟩= P
n cn|n⟩⟨n| and cn is the prob-
ability function of a thermal distribution with mean µ0.
