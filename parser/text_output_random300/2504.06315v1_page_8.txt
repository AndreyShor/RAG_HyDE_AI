Numerical Solution of the Eye2Heart Closed-Loop Model
The Eye2Heart mathematical model was implemented in MATLAB and solved using the stiff solver ODE15s [31], a
variable-step, variable-order solver designed to efficiently solve stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). ODE15s
was chosen to solve the system of ODEs due to its ability to efficiently handle stiffness, ensuring stable and accurate
numerical solutions. The solver was configured with a relative tolerance of 10−13 and an absolute tolerance 10−5,
ensuring high numerical precision. A fixed time step of 0.001 s was used throughout the simulations. To minimize
numerical artifacts, transient effects at the beginning of the simulation were discarded.

Model validation
The model’s cardiovascular component is validated through comparison with well-established physiological indica-
tors. The following key parameters are computed and contrasted with clinical literature:
• End-Diastolic Volume (EDV): Maximum ventricular volume during the cardiac cycle.
• End-Systolic Volume (ESV): Minimum ventricular volume during the cardiac cycle.
• Stroke Volume (SV): S V = EDV −ES V, representing the amount of blood ejected per beat.
• Cardiac Output (CO): CO = HR × S V
1000, measuring total blood flow per minute, where HR is heart rate.
• Ejection Fraction (EF): EF = 100 × S V
EDV , quantifying ventricular efficiency as the percentage of blood ejected
during each beat.
• End-Systolic Elastance (Ees): slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship.
• Arterial Elastance (Ea): estimate of aortic input impedance.
• Central Systolic and Diastolic Pressures (SP/DP).
• Right Atrial Pressure (Pra).
Table 3 presents a comparison between model predictions and clinical reference values, considering these quantitative
indicators.
The model predictions for key cardiovascular biomarkers,
including ventricular volumes, stroke volume, cardiac
output, and ejection fraction, align well with reported clinical values. Notably, EDV and ESV for both left and right
ventricles fall within the expected clinical ranges, with only slight underestimations compared to some references.
This discrepancy may be attributed to model simplifications in ventricular compliance or assumptions on pressure-
volume relationships.
SV is well captured, remaining within the accepted physiological range, reinforcing the model’s ability to replicate
fundamental cardiac dynamics. Similarly, the predicted CO falls within the expected 4−8 L/min range, demonstrating
the model’s ability to effectively integrate heart rate and stroke volume.
The EF, a key indicator of ventricular function, is slightly lower than some clinical values but remains within a
reasonable physiological range. This could suggest that the model, while accurately capturing systolic and diastolic
phases, may benefit from refinements in contractility representation or vascular resistance calibration. Nonetheless,
the overall agreement with literature values indicates a robust framework for modeling cardiac function.
In terms of Ees, the model predicts a value of of 1.03 mmHg/ml for the left ventricle and 0.32 mmHg/ml for the
right ventricle. These values are slightly higher than those reported in [32] and [26], respectively. This discrepancy
may stem from the model’s simplified assumptions regarding the pressure-volume relationship and elastance dynam-
ics. Furthermore, the model does not account for individual variability, particularly for the left ventricle, which could
contribute to the observed differences.
