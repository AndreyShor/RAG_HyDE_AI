We use the multi-index notation α = α1, . . . , αk with k = |α| throughout the article.
Note that we adopt a convention where the orientation is given by end point minus initial point. This
is customary in mathematics, while in QFT one more often uses initial point minus end point. Both
conventions differ by a minus sign for odd k.
We also define a differential form of the propagator Qν;α(x, y) = Qν;α1,...,αk(x, y) where the indices
are subscripts,

The subscript ν ∈R refers to the scaling weight ∥x∥−2λν of Qα
ν (x) and of Qν;α(x). We say that the
weight of the edge from x to y is ν,

NQα
ν = NQν;α = ν.
A propagator may have indices which are repeated twice (but not more often). We use Einstein’s sum
convention that double indices are summed over (from 1 to D) without explicitly writing the sum symbol.
We also assume that α is only defined up to permutations, so that α becomes a multi-set with a maximum
of two repetitions of each entry. Changing the orientation of a propagator line results in a minus sign for
odd |α|.
We work in Euclidean signature so that the metric tensor becomes a Kronecker delta,
gαi,αj = δαi,αj.
So, e.g., gα1,α1 = δα1,α1 = D for every single index α1. For conceptual reasons, we use the symbol g and
not δ for the metric.
The propagator Qν;α is connected to the momentum space propagator via a Fourier transformation

for the propagator chain.

In differential form, the reduction of double indices is more subtle. By explicit differentiation we get for
