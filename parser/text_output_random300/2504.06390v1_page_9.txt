ne is the charge density, Γ0 is the phenomenological relaxation rate, ∆E = E0+ −E0−is the
energy difference of the two bands, I is the optical intensity of the photon which causes the
optical transition between the two bands, c is the light velocity, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity,
and nr is the refractive index. Starting from Eqs. (19) and (20), we obtain the total optical
absorption coefficient given by
χ(Ω, I) = χ(1)(Ω) + χ(3)(Ω, I).

Linear and nonlinear refractive index
Using the same procedure as in the case of the optical absorption coefficient, we obtain the
linear and third-order nonlinear refractive index given, respectively, by
∆n(1)(Ω)

The following relation then gives the total refractive index:

The optical properties are given by Eqs. (16) to (21) and depend strongly on the param-
eters of the graphene, the incident photon energy ℏΩ, and the energy gap ∆E due to the
polaron effect. These equations do not clearly show the polaron’s effect on its parameters.
Hence, numerical analyses are necessary.
