Wolfowicz et al. [24], "Quantum Guidelines for Solid-State Spin Defects". This review offers a 
set of broad guidelines for the development and application of solid-state spin defects in 
quantum information processing. The authors discuss defect properties, host material 
characteristics, engineering opportunities, and potential pathways for improving coherence 
times, optical properties, and scalability. 
 
Given the existence of these in-depth and widely cited review articles, a legitimate question arises: What 
unique contribution does this paper make, and how does it differentiate itself from prior work? Unlike the 
broader scope of the aforementioned reviews, this paper is specifically tailored for early-career 
experimental researchers focusing on the controllable formation of color centers in SiC for quantum qubit 
applications. Instead of attempting to cover the entire landscape of SiC quantum applications, this review 
adopts a focused and practical approach by emphasizing defect engineering techniques and their 
relevance to quantum qubit performance. This review provides an overview of methods for generating 
SiC defects, including irradiation, ion implantation, and laser processing [14,15,16,17,18]. Moreover, 
many existing reviews are either theory-oriented [2,4] or focused on the comprehensive material 
characterization that includes a whole variety of techniques such as low-temperature photoluminescence 
(PL), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) 
techniques [22,23,25,26,27,28]. This review aims to bridge the gap between theoretical studies and 
comprehensive material characterization by focusing on the intermediate step, defect creation.  
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the fundamental principles of quantum qubits, 
outlining the criteria that a defect center must satisfy to function as a viable qubit. Section 3, the core of 
this review, focuses on the selected SiC defects and their formation by different experimental methods. 
Section 4 provides a summary and conclusion. By maintaining a well-defined and specialized focus, this 
review serves as a valuable resource for experimentalists looking to advance their expertise in SiC-based 
quantum defect fabrication. It ensures that researchers can efficiently access the most relevant 
information to accelerate their work on next-generation quantum technologies. 
 
2. Quantum qubits 
This section provides an overview of the fundamental properties of quantum qubits. A quantum qubit (or 
simply "qubit") serves as the fundamental unit of quantum information, analogous to a classical bit. 
However, unlike a classical bit, which can only exist in a definite state of 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a 
superposition of both states simultaneously (as graphically presented in Figure 2). These two basis states 
are typically represented as ‚à£0‚ü© and ‚à£1‚ü© [1,29]. The general state of a qubit is given by: 
 ÔÉ™ÔÅπ ÔÉ±=  ÔÅ° ÔÉ™0ÔÉ±+  ùõΩ ÔÉ™1ÔÉ± 
where Œ± and Œ≤ are complex probability amplitudes. The squared magnitudes of these amplitudes, |Œ±|2 
and ‚à£Œ≤‚à£2, represent the probabilities of measuring the qubit in the ‚à£0‚ü© or ‚à£1‚ü© state, respectively, and must 
always sum to one: 
‚à£Œ±‚à£2 + ‚à£Œ≤‚à£2 = 1
