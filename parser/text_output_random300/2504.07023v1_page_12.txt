Swinging small quantum systems out of available values of control parameters
12
results are almost the same as for cut-off K = 2 while for G = 0.2 some small deviations
in the middle moments are visible. However, the final fidelity is still almost the same. For
stronger interactions (an example for G = 0.5 is presented) assumed cut-off K = 2 is clearly
insufficient. Thus, in the top row, we limit ourselves only to sufficiently small interactions.
Of course, in principle, the method presented can be straightforwardly extended to include
stronger interactions with the third component or to increase the number of particles. This
however would require much larger computational resources and is beyond the scope of this
work.
6. Conclusion
By using quantum optimal control, we have proposed a systematic and effective scheme
for steering small quantum systems toward ground states that are inaccessible due to
experimental limitations of the available range of the control parameter.
As generic
illustrations, we have demonstrated the viability of the scheme for model systems like
an interacting two-qubit model or two- and three-component mixture of a few ultra-cold
fermions. In the latter case, we considered a scenario for which the target state is demanded
only for the two-component subsystem. In all these cases we demonstrated that the selected
target state can be obtained with nearly perfect fidelity and with fairly finite duration. In
addition, we have shown the robustness of the scheme by considering the perturbation to
the optimized protocols.
Our findings can be particularly important and useful for studying many-body systems
that display exotic properties only for extreme values of control parameters.
It also
highlights the potential efficiency of optimal control techniques in advancing experimental
realizations of quantum simulations and computations.
