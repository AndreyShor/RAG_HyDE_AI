tering the optimization source code.
Based on the known physical behavior of the beam-
line elements, the GP model employed a Mat´ern 5/2 ker-
nel [17, 28, 29] with Gamma priors, which was preferred
over the Radial Basis Function (RBF) for its flexibility
in modeling smooth functions.
The Upper Confidence
Bound (UCB) was chosen as the acquisition function due
to its effective balance between exploration and exploita-
tion, which is critical for optimizing complex systems.
This function is defined as,
α(x) = µ(x) + βν(x)
(1)
where µ(x) is the predicted mean and ν(x) is the uncer-
tainty of the GP model. The parameter β controls the
exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Prioritizing a high µ and low ν by choosing a small
β in (1), leads the algorithm to exploit known good re-
sults, while a high β encourages exploration in areas with
high uncertainty and potential reward. The impact of β
is demonstrated in Fig. 3, where the value of β was ad-
justed during an optimization run.
It is worth noting
that such cases that start without a feedback signal are
very challenging, even for experienced facility staff. The
results in Fig. 3, highlight some of the benefits of our
approach.
Figure 4 illustrates various aspects of optimizing the
radioactive beamline Section 1. The top panel displays
live optimization of the observed activity versus iteration.
The times scale of our optimization iterations is selected
such that, after background subtraction, an increment of
the observed activity is proportional to an increment in
the RIB intensity. Initially, the observed rate fluctuates

FIG. 3. Effect of varying β on optimization. Left: Conser-
vative exploration with β = 2 stalls at a suboptimal local
maximum (observed no RIB). Center: Aggressive exploration
with β = 3 reaches high-performance regions (found RIB).
Right: Returning to β = 2 prioritizes exploitation, converging
to the global maximum (increased RIB rate).
as the algorithm explores the tuning space of quadrupoles
and steerers, characterized by large changes. As itera-
tions progress, the algorithm refines the machine con-
figuration, resulting in steady RIB rate improvements.
Despite significant drops around iterations 70, 80, and
100, the algorithm successfully returned to optimal set-
tings. In the final iteration, a background measurement
was conducted by removing the beam to measure the
beam-off rate, stemming from the beta decay chain. The
Bateman equation [30] for a two-isotope chain approxi-
mates this curve:
λP
λD −λP AP (0)(e−λP t −e−λDt) + AD(0)eλDt
(2)
Where λP is the decay constant of the parent nucleus,
λD, the decay constant of the daughter nucleus, AP is
the initial beam rate, and AD is the initial daughter
rate.
The net rate is calculated as: (Observed Activ-
ity) - (Background Activity).
In the bottom panel of Fig. 4 the tuning of con-
trol variables across iterations highlights the balance be-
tween exploration and exploitation. Up to iteration 40,
variations are large as the algorithm samples the pa-
rameter space.
Later iterations converge towards op-
timal settings, demonstrating BO’s capability in multi-
dimensional optimization.
Figure 5(a) shows a correlation heatmap between tun-
ing variables, useful for understanding inter-variable in-
fluences. Strong positive correlations (red) indicate di-
rect proportionality, while negative correlations (blue)
suggest inverse relationships. For instance, QH-control
and Steer1-X have small positive correlations (0.34 and
0.28) with Beam Rate, indicating moderate increases
with voltage.
Conversely, Steer1-Y, Quad1-X, and
Quad1-Y show high negative correlations (-0.706, -0.647,
-0.547), suggesting beam rate benefits from reduced volt-
age. A high positive correlation (0.891) between Beam
Rate and Iteration aligns with optimization rules. Ele-
ments like Steer2-X (-0.003), Steer2-Y (0.024), and QS-
Y (-0.150) show near-zero correlation, indicating no di-
rect influence on beam rate. Further analysis identifies
