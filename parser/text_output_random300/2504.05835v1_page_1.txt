Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic ﬁelds (PMFs)
strong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic ﬁelds. We employ a scalar ﬁeld
charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to provide an eﬀective mass
term to the EM ﬁeld and thus break its conformal invariance. The primordial magneto-
genesis takes place in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry
breaking (EWSB) phase.
As a result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-
production of electric ﬁelds due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon
isocurvature problem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB
phase. In addition, we ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant amount of PMFs can be generated when
the scalar ﬁeld experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar ﬁeld is light and
weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to the cold dark matter, hence
the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction problem are also absent. Therefore, our
model is free from the above-mentioned problems that frequently appear in other primordial
magneto-genesis scenarios.
