and has no analogue in the three-body system. Motions of each particle are shown in the
lower right panel, and have two bodies undergoing small amplitude oscillations (solid
and dotted lines) with the other two undergoing a larger amplitude oscillation (dash and
dot-dash lines).
Figure 54. A three-dimensional periodic orbit (lower left) that has a pretzel form when projected into
the (ρ, β) (upper left) and (ρ, α) (similar to upper left panel) planes and annulus form when onto the
(β, α) plane (upper right), using FE (H/Mtot = 1) conditions, where initially ρ = α = 0, β = 2.2 and
pρ = 0.15, pα = 0.37509, and pβ = 0. Particle trajectories are shown in the (lower right).
The upper panels of Figure 55 show a situitation where the four particles begin at zero
momentum and are equally spaced. As expected, they are all attracted together and cross at
the same point, repeating this pattern indeﬁnitely. The symbol sequence is undeﬁned since
all four particles always ‘collide’ at the same time step. The box particle oscillates along a
line in (ρ, β, α) space (upper left), with all particles crossing at the origin simultaneously.
The outer two particles (solid, dot-dash) undergo large amplitude oscillations and the inner
two (dash, dotted) undergo small amplitude oscillations. However, the motion is unstable:
a slight change in any of the initial conditions (via either a small perturbation in position
or momentum) throws the system into chaos. This is shown in the bottom two panels of
Figure 55, where the initial value of ρ is slightly increased. All particle trajectories (lower
right) continually vary their oscillation amplitudes. This is evident within 30 time steps,
where we see the dashed-line grow in amplitude whilst the dot–dash one shrinks.
