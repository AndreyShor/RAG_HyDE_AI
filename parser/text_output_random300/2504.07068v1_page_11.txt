where the second line is by Theorem 16, namely, the environment system of a CPTP map, which preserves the state,
acts only on the redundant system. The inequality above can be saturated by choosing Λ2 as a map which traces out
system N and for given c outputs a pure state |ωc⟩⟨ωc|NE′ and by letting Λ3 = id. Finally, by deﬁnition

The diﬀerence with Proposition 9 is that the map MGnR′n֒→E′ acts on R′n as well. To obtain the second inequality
note that R′n in the puriﬁed input state P
xn √pxn |xn⟩An
|xn⟩Rn
|xn⟩R′n
is another copy of system An, hence, the
desired E′ system in Uhlmann’s construction can be obtained by applying a map only on An. Finally the proposition
follows by dividing the above inequality by n and taking the limit of n →∞and ǫ →0. The ǫ-terms vanish because
the dimension of system E′ is bounded as explained in Remark 4.

DISCUSSION
We consider an asymptotic i.i.d. simulation of an arbitrary channel N : A →BK, with an isometric extension
UN : A →BKG, acting as (N ⊗idR)ρAR on a general mixed input state shared with a reference system R. An
encoder, Alice, has access to An, and the goal is to simulate system Bn at the decoder side, Bob, and system Kn at
her side. This general deﬁnition captures various considerations of [2] in a single model: classical, quantum, feedback,
non-feedback. The two extreme cases of the fully classical and fully quantum models in [2] are realized by constraining
ρAR to be either a classical state or a pure quantum state, respectively. The non-feedback and feedback models are
realized by constraining K = ∅or K = G (the environment of an isometric extension), respectively. We also recover
