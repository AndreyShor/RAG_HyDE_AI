FIG. 1. (a) Schematic of the system under consideration, where the unidirectional SOC potential of the PST and the proximity-
induced dxy-wave pair potential coexist in the thin ﬁlm. (b)–(c) Energy spectra as a function of kx for (b) (W, λ) = (800a, 0),
(c) (W, λ) = (30a, 0), and (d) (W, λ) = (30a, 0.5t), with an open boundary condition applied in the y direction. As shown in
(d), the energy spectrum of the ABS exhibits a gap, Eg, resulting from the ﬁnite-size hybridization and unidirectional SOC.

The PST
was originally discovered in zinc-blende semiconductor
quantum wells [57, 58]. More recently, the formation of
the PST has been predicted in a variety of 2D mate-
rials, including wurtzite-structured semiconductors [59],
ferroelectric semiconductors [60–66], monolayer transi-
tion metal dichalcogenides [67, 68], and group IV-V com-
pounds [69], enabling the experimental realization of the
proposed system. Consequently, we propose an intrigu-
ing route for exploring novel topological superconducting
phases driven by gapped ABSs.
Emergence of zero-energy states.
We describe the
present system using a 2D tight-binding model on a
square lattice.
A lattice site is indicated by a vector
r = jx + my, where |x| = |y| = a.
We apply a pe-
riodic boundary condition in the x direction, while an
open boundary condition is applied in the y direction;
the thin ﬁlm is placed on 1 ≤m ≤M with W = Ma
representing the width of the system. The Bogoliubov–de
Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian reads,

ckx,m,s is an annihilation operator of an electron at
y = ma with momentum kx and spin s (=↑, ↓), t denotes
the nearest-neighbor hopping integral, µ is the chemical
potential, λ represents the strength of the unidirectional
SOC forming the PST, and ∆denotes the proximity-
induced spin-singlet dxy-wave pair potential. τν and sν
for ν = x, y, z denote the Pauli matrices in Nambu and
spin spaces, respectively.
When we apply a periodic
boundary condition in both x and y directions, the BdG
Hamiltonian is rewritten as, Hk = ξkτz + λ sin(kya)sz −
∆ksy ⊗τy with ξk = −2t cos(kxa) −2t cos(kya) −µ + 4t
and ∆k = ∆sin(kxa) sin(kya). The PST inherently guar-
antees spin-rotational symmetry [57, 58]:
[Rz, Hkx] = 0,
Rz = isz ⊗τz,

where Rz describes the spin rotation along the z axis.
Therefore, we can decompose the Hamiltonian into two
subsectors, each corresponding to a diﬀerent eigenvalue
of Rz:
