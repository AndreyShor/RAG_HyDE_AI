Early Warning Signs for SPDEs with Red Noise
for any v1, v2, w1, w2 ∈H1. Such an operator satisfies [6, Lemma 3.1] the equality
V τ

(3.10)
A standard way to employ the time-asymptotic autocorrelation as an early-warning sign is to consider it as the nonlinear operator

of the mild solution ud of (2.2) is not sufficient to describe the autocorrelation as an exponential function to be employed as an
EWS in the limit p →0−. Then, the structure of the stochastic perturbation ξ1 in (2.1) is required to obtain such a construction.
In contrast, the time-asymptotic autocorrelation ˆV τ

∈H1 × H1,
any v1 ∈H1 and w ∈H1 × H1 displays a more complex structure as a function of τ. This structure can be computed explicitly
from (3.10), depends on κ, and is deferred for future studies. Conversely, any
v =

for v2 ∈H1 is an eigenfunction of B0(p)∗with eigenvalue −κ. Hence,
ˆV τ
∞(v, w) = e−κτ
holds for any w ∈H1 × H1 such that ⟨v, V∞w⟩H1×H1 ̸= 0. In conclusion, the knowledge of the behaviour of ξ1 in time is sufficient
to construct another (false) EWS in the limit κ →0+ for any τ > 0.

Numerical Analysis
In this section, we discuss numerical simulations to cross-validate our findings. We numerically solve different types of SPDEs and
study the variance of projections along specific modes over a large time interval. Through ergodic theory, such a value approximates
the time-asymptotic variance on the corresponding functions in H1. As such, we substitute the observable with the time variance
of the solutions in the time interval [0, T], for T = 105. As discussed in the previous section, we observe different scaling laws in
the EWS depending on the assumptions of the systems we consider. Figure 1 and Figure 2 encompass our results by displaying
the rate of the observables in log-log plots in the limits p →0−and κ →0+, respectively. In Figure 1 we fix the value κ = 2,
whereas in Figure 2 we consider p = 0.5.
