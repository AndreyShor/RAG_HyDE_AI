Proof. We know that DHR(A•) is a rigid C∗-tensor category by Corollary A.5. In particular,
˜F is faithful. To show fullness, we can use the Frobenius reciprocity to reduce the claim to
HomDHR(A•)(A, X) ≃HomZ(C)(A−, X−).
Let us consider a morphism in the right hand side. It is given by an A−-central vector ξ in
X−such that βX,Y (ξ ⊠A η) = η ⊠A ξ holds for all Y ∈DHR(A•) and η ∈Y−.
By construction ξ is also A+-central, hence it is a B0-central vector. We then have an interval
[−L, L] around 0 such that ξ is localized on [−L, L].
Let us ﬁx Y , and a right projective basis (η1
i )i localized in an interval to the left of −L, and
another basis (η2
j )j localized to the right of L. Let tY
ij be the corresponding charge transporters.
On one hand, by η1
i ∈Y−, we have βX,Y (ξ ⊠A η1
i ) = η1
i ⊠A ξ as remarked above. On the
other, by deﬁnition of the braiding, we also have βX,Y (ξ ⊠A η2
j ) = η2
j ⊠A ξ. We thus have an
equality of the form
X
i
η1
i ⊗tY
ijξ =
X
i
η1
i ⊗ξtY
ij
This, together with commutation of ⟨η1
i′|η1
i ⟩and ξ, implies that we have
X
i
⟨[tY
ij, ξ]|[tY
ij, ξ]⟩= 0.
This implies [tY
ij, ξ] = 0 for all i and j.
Now, by Condition 4.10, ξ commutes with a generating set of A, hence it is A-central. Thus,
ξ represents a morphism in HomDHR(A•)(A, X).

Remark 5.5. If we further assume Condition 5.6 and that DHR(A•) has only ﬁnitely many
irreducible classes, there is an alternative argument as follows.
In this case we know that
DHR(A•) is a modular tensor functor from Theorem 5.7, and ˜F is a braided tensor functor.
Then the claim follows from [DMNO13, Corollary 3.26].
5.2. Nondegeneracy of the DHR category. In this section, our goal will be to show that
under some assumption on the inclusion B0 ⊂A, the category of DHR bimodules is non-
degenerately braided.
We assume that the net A• is rational (Condition 3.3), i.e., there is a conditional expectation
of ﬁnite index E : A →B0. This allows us to consider the basic extension
A ⊂B1 = ⟨A, e⟩,
and the dual expectation E1 : B1 →A. In particular, B1 admits an A-valued inner product
induced by E1.
We introduce the following condition, which will be used to prove non-degeneracy. We will
later see that B1 agrees with the algebra Zreg of Section 3 under this condition.
Condition 5.6 (Locally aligned). We say that a rational net A• is locally aligned if the
algebra B1 is a DHR bimodule over A•.
Observe that we are stating Condition 5.6 as stronger than rationality. That is, whenever we
say an abstract spin chain A• is locally aligned, it will be implicitly assumed that it is rational.
Our goal is to prove the following, motivated by Proposition 3.1.
Theorem 5.7. Let A• be a net satisfying Conditions 5.6. Suppose that X is a DHR bimodule
such that βB1,XβX,B1 = id. Then XA is a direct sum multiple of A.
For the moment let us assume that X satisﬁes the above assumption. Choose F1 < F3 < F2
such that there is a basis (ηk)m
k=1 of B1 localized in F3, such that e appears as one of the ηk,
say η0.
As before, choose bases (ξ1
i )n
i=1 and (ξ2
j )n
j=1 of X localized in F1 and F2. We may and do
assume that the elements ⟨ξ1
i |ξ1
j ⟩= p(1)
ij
and ⟨ξ2
i |ξ2
j ⟩= p(2)
ij
belong to B0, hence commute with
e.
