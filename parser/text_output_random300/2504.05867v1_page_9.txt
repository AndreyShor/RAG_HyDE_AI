Figure 5. Analysis of the light curves, left panel represent the REDFIT curve of γ-ray emissions and right panel exhibit
the REDFIT curve of optical emissions, using the AR(1) process with the REDFIT software. The red noise-corrected power
spectrum (black) is presented alongside theoretical (blue) and average AR(1) (cyan) spectra. The significance levels of 99%,
95%, and 90% are indicated in red, green, and brown, respectively.

Figure 6. The celerite modeling with DRW model was performed using the 10-day binned γ-ray light curve of blazar ON
246 over 4000 days from the time stamp MJD 55932. In this figure, the top panel depicts the γ-ray flux points with their
uncertainties, along with the best-fitting profile of the DRW model in blue, including the 1σ confidence interval. The bottom
panels represent the autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of the standardized residuals (bottom left) and the squared of standardized
residuals (bottom right), respectively, along with 95% confidence intervals of the white noise.
Monte Carlo method. We found a lag of 0.736+3.13
−2.73 day
with the γ-ray leading the optical emissions. In addi-
tion to cross-correlation centroid distribution (CCCD),
we also estimated the cross-correlation peak distribution
(CCPD); see the right panel of Figure 11. To access the
significance, we also calculated the ICCF between the γ-
ray and DRW mock optical light curves (see Section 5);
the observed findings are shown in the left panel of Fig-
ure 11. After simulating the 10000 mock ICCFs between
γ-ray and optical mock light curves, we calculated the
significance level of the ICCF peak observed in corre-
lation analysis between the observed γ-ray and ASAS-
SN lightcurves.
In the left panel of Figure 11, a red
dashed curve represents the 99.9999%, corresponding to
4σ, significance level. The observed finding indicates a
significant correlation with almost zero-day lag between
γ-ray and optical emissions, suggesting a common origin
of them (D. P. Cohen et al. 2014).
