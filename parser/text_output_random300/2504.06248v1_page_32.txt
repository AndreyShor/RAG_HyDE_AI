Proof of the Lemma: Infinitesimal criterion of symmetry under Koopman’s perspective
To use Thm. S23 in our context, we first adapt Defs. 2.30 and 2.70 of Ref. [60] for systems of first-order ODEs.
Definition S25. Let ∆i(t, u, ˙u) = 0 for i ∈{1, ..., N} be a system of first-order ordinary differential equations. The
system is of maximal rank if the N × (2N + 1) Jacobian matrix of ∆= (∆1, ..., ∆N),
J∆(t, u, ˙u) =


is of rank N for all (t, u, ˙u) such that ∆(t, u, ˙u) = 0.
Definition S26. A system of N first-order differential equations, ∆(t, u, ˙u) = 0 is locally solvable at the point
(t0, u0, ˙u0) ∈G∆= {(t, u, ˙u) | ∆(t, u, ˙u) = 0} if there exists a smooth solution u = y(t) of the system, defined for t
in a neighborhood of t0, which has the prescribed “initial condition” ˙u0 = pr(1) y(t0). The system is locally solvable
if it is locally solvable at every point of G∆. A system is nondegenerate if at every point (t0, u0, ˙u0) ∈G∆it is both
locally solvable and of maximal rank.
Consider the system of first-order ordinary differential equations (henceforth, called the “dynamics”)
dyi
dt = Fi(t, y1, ..., yN) ,
i ∈{1, ..., N} ,
(S80)
with initial condition yi(t0) = (u0)i for all i, t0 < t, and F1, ..., FN are smooth (C ∞) in their arguments. Note that
we could relax the differentiability requirements in principle, but we use smooth functions for simplicity and to be
coherent with the approach and the results in Ref. [60, see p.4 and p.96]. Let us define the smooth functions ∆i for
all i ∈{1, ..., N} on the 1-jet space related to the i-th equation in the dynamics such that
∆i(t, u, ˙u) = ˙ui −Fi(t, u) ,
(S81)
where u = (u1, ..., uN) ∈RN and ˙u = ( ˙u1, ..., ˙uN) ∈RN are coordinates with t ∈T for the jet space. In such case,
the next lemma shows that there is no problem with the system regarding the condition of maximal rank and local
solvability.
Lemma S7. The dynamics in Eq. (S80) is nondegenerate.
Proof. The N × (2N + 1) Jacobian matrix of ∆= (∆1, ..., ∆N) where ∆i is given in Eq. (S81) is
J∆(t, u, ˙u) =




∂F1(t,u)
∂t
−∂F1(t,u)
∂u1
... −∂F1(t,u)
∂uN

... ... ...
∂FN(t,u)
∂t
−∂FN(t,u)
∂u1
... −∂FN(t,u)
∂uN
0 ... 1




and is of rank N with respect to all (t, u, ˙u), because of the N ×N identity submatrix in the last columns of J∆(t, u, ˙u).
The dynamics is thus of maximal rank.
Moreover, by assumption, the vector field in Eq. (S80) is smooth. Thus, there exists a unique smooth solution
y(t) = u starting at y(t0) = u0 by Lem. 2.3 of Ref. [90].
The existence of the solution and the form of the
differential equations imply that ˙y(t0) = F (t0, y(t0)) = F (t0, u0) =: ˙u0. Such solution exists for any initial condition
(u0, ˙u0) = pr(1) y(t0) ∈G∆and the system is therefore locally solvable and altogether, nondegenerate.
Consider the set O of time-dependent smooth observables f : S ⊂T × U →R. The Koopman operator for a
non-autonomous dynamical system described by Eq. (S80) is Uφ : T × T × O →O with Uφt0,t[f] := Uφ(t0, t, f) and
it acts on an observable f such that
Uφt0,t[f] = f ◦φt0,t
with the properties Uφt0,t0 = id and Uφa,t+a◦Uφt0,a = Uφt0,t+a [91]. There is a family (Ut0)t0∈T of Koopman generators
Ut0[f](u0) = df(t, y(t))
