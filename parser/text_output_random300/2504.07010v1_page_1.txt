Abstract
In the Quantum Supremacy regime, quantum computers may over-
come classical machines on several tasks if we can estimate, miti-
gate, or correct unavoidable hardware noise. Estimating the error re-
quires classical simulations, which become unfeasible in the Quantum
Supremacy regime. We leverage Machine Learning data-driven ap-
proaches and Conformal Prediction, a Machine Learning uncertainty
quantification tool known for its mild assumptions and finite-sample
validity, to find theoretically valid upper bounds of the fidelity be-
tween noiseless and noisy outputs of quantum devices.
Under rea-
sonable extrapolation assumptions, the proposed scheme applies to
any Quantum Computing hardware, does not require modeling the
device’s noise sources, and can be used when classical simulations are
unavailable, e.g. in the Quantum Supremacy regime.

Introduction
The high potential of Quantum Computing (QC) has not manifested yet in
real-world applications (Dasgupta and Humble, 2022). Tasks where QC has
proven scalability advantages (Arute et al., 2019) require correcting errors
induced by hardware noise. Available Quantum Error Correction algorithms
(Lidar and Brun, 2013), based on physics-informed Noise and Error Models
(NEMs) that make strong assumptions on the underlying quantum process,
