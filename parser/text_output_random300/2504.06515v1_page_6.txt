Note that this procedure incorporates an additional ﬁeld Ψ in the gravitational ac-
tion. This might seem to be in tension with the second desirable feature in the list above.

which is the geodesic equation, or rather equations since there is one per particle.
The system (14,15) forms a closed relativistic self-gravitating system of N point par-
ticles. The space–time curvature is determined from the stress-energy of the particulate
matter from (14); in turn, the evolution of the particles is determined by the space–time
curvature via (15).
The theory given by the action (10) is known as R = T theory [32–34] . Its classical
properties, including gravitational collapse, black holes, cosmological solutions, solitonic
properties, and thermodynamics have been extensively studied [35–69]. Its chief interest
lies in the fact that it captures the essence of classical general relativity in two space–time
dimensions, and has (1 + 1)–dimensional analogs of many of its properties [35,70,71].
Moreover, it has a well-deﬁned Newtonian limit [33,35]. This is in contrast to generic
scalar-tensor theories [72], where the dilaton does not decouple from the evolution of the
gravitational ﬁeld.
The quantum properties of R = T theory have also received attention from a variety of
perspectives [37,73–89]. There is also a supersymmetric version of the theory [90], which
has supersymmetric black hole solutions [91–93]. Recently, experiments have been carried
out [94,95] that test certain aspects of the theory, albeit in a simulated context.
The remainder of this article is concerned with the N-body problem and its solutions
as determined from the equations that follow from the action (10). The canonical approach
is the most useful way to obtain these equations. This is the subject of the next section.
