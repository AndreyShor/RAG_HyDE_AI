FIG. 1. Superiority of the modified-residue prescription. A comparison of the Riemann sum (RSum) and the modified-
residue prescription (mRes) to evaluate χC(ω), with ∆θ = ∆0 cos(2θ) for C ∈{A1g, B1g, B2g}. Here N = 40. The exact
calculations, obtained using the method of quadratures (which uses a high resolution and adaptive mesh), are shown as dashed
lines.

of the singularity (1/
√
x2 −1 or 1/√x −1 forms near
x ∼1) is not important as long as Sm(ω) uses the appro-
priate s(ω, x) – see Appendix A. Although such closed-
form results are not always achievable, one does not need
to explicitly evaluate the integral to deduce s(ω, θ) [22].
Knowing I(ω, θ) and s(ω, θ), we can now follow the pre-
scription in Eq. (6). In Fig. 1 we plot the ‘exact’ result
with the dashed line.
It was obtained using an adap-
tive quadrature numerical routine (SciPy’s nquad [30])
on Eq. (8). We then present the result for the modified-
residue prescription with N = 40 with dark solid lines
and that with the Riemann sum with light solid lines.
The panels (a)–(c) correspond to different choices of C
which affects the slope of the low-ω behaviour and also
the singularity (or lack thereof) at ω = 2∆0. It is evident
that the residue sum outperforms the Riemann sum and
correctly captures the slopes and singular features of the
result. This improvement will be quantified in Sec. IV.

Incorporation with other prescriptions
The Riemann sum discussed above is also referred to
as the rectangle rule for integration. Consider also the
following prescriptions [31] which are known to perform
better than the rectangle rule:
• Trapezoidal rule, which implements

• Gaussian quadratures, which rescales the integra-

dx I(x) ≈
X
m
wmI(xm),
for some pre-computed sample points {xm} and
{wm} (according to some orthogonal set of poly-
nomials) for a given N.
In all of these prescriptions, we have essentially a
weighted sum over the discrete points I(xm).
The
weights, however, are not tied to any form of a singu-
larity and, therefore, finer meshes would be demanded to
correctly integrate singular integrands using these pre-
scriptions. Nonetheless, our prescription could be incor-
porated into the above schemes to obtain better results
without requiring a finer mesh by suitably promoting δ to
Sm/s(xm), provided we have knowledge of the nature of
the local asymptotic singularity s(x). The logic remains
that in the non-singular sub-intervals, the proposed form
already implements the original prescription, while pro-
viding the appropriate value for the singular sub-integral.
Note:
It is worth noting that Sm can also be evalu-
ated numerically with a high density of grid points. This
is not the same as evaluating
R
dθ I(ω, θ) numerically
with the same high density of grid points because we
do not have access to I(θ) at those finer grid points. But
knowing the asymptotic form, albeit only in the singular
sub-interval, provides an analytical structure that can be
integrated over a finer grid. This step is not really more
computationally expensive that using the analytical form
for Sm. At this point, we may also note that when one
needs to compute multi-dimensional integrals, one often
resorts to Monte Carlo-based techniques. While these are
known to perform best when the integrand is bounded,
there are special algorithms designed to deal with singu-
lar integrands (see, for instance, Ref. [32]). We leave the
incorporation of this idea into Monte Carlo techniques to
a future endeavour.
