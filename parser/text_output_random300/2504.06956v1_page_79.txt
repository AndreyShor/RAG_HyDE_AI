Brownian bridge above a curve

Proof. For a, k > 1 and s â‰¥0, we define the events
AÂ±
s
def=

inf
râˆˆ[s,b](Br Â± Î¶a,k(r)) > 0

,
so that the probability in the statement can be written as P0,u,b(A+
0 \ Aâˆ’
s ). For x â‰¥Î¶a,k(s), we have
that
P0,u,b(A+
0 \ Aâˆ’
s )
P0,u,b(A+
0 )
= 1 âˆ’P0,u,b(A+
0 âˆ©Aâˆ’
s )
P0,u,b(A+
0 )
â‰¤1 âˆ’P0,u,b(A+
0 âˆ©Aâˆ’
s âˆ©{Bs â‰¥x})
P0,u,b(A+
0 )
.
(A.20)
Our goal now is to find a suitable lower bound for the probability in the numerator on the right
hand-side of (A.20). To this end, we define the event
A+
0,s
def=

inf
râˆˆ[0,s](Br + Î¶a,k(r)) > 0

,
and we note that
P0,u,b(A+
0 âˆ©Aâˆ’
s âˆ©{Bs â‰¥x}) = E0,u,b
h
1{A+
0,sâˆ©{Bsâ‰¥x}}P0,u,b(Aâˆ’
s | Ïƒ((Br)râ‰¤s))
i
.
For any s âˆˆ(0, b/2], on the event {Bs â‰¥x}, thanks to Proposition A.4 and Lemma A.7, we have that
there exists a constant c1 = c1(a) > 0 such that
P0,u,b(Aâˆ’
s | Ïƒ((Br)râ‰¤s)) â‰¥2Bsu
b âˆ’s

1 âˆ’c1
Î¶a,k+s(0)
x
+ [log(e + x4)]2
x
+ ob(1)

.
Similarly, for any s âˆˆ(0, b/2], on the event {Bs â‰¥x}, thanks to Proposition A.5 and Lemma A.7, we
have that there exists a constant c2 = c2(a) > 0 such that
P0,u,b(A+
s | Ïƒ((Br)râ‰¤s)) â‰¤2Bsu
b âˆ’s

1 + c2
Î¶a,k+s(0)
x
+ Î¶a,k+s(0)2
x2
+ [log(e + x4)]4
x
+ ob(1)

.
Therefore, denoting by Î´ and eÎ´ the two error terms in the previous two displays, we have that
P0,u,b(A+
0 âˆ©Aâˆ’
s âˆ©{Bs â‰¥x}) â‰¥1 âˆ’Î´
1 + eÎ´
P0,u,b(A+
0 âˆ©{Bs â‰¥x}) ,
and so
P0,u,b(A+
0 âˆ©Aâˆ’
s âˆ©{Bs â‰¥x})
P0,u,b(A+
0 )
â‰¥1 âˆ’Î´
1 + eÎ´
P0,u,b(A+
0 âˆ©{Bs â‰¥x})
P0,u,b(A+
0 )
= 1 âˆ’Î´
1 + eÎ´

1 âˆ’P0,u,b(A+
0 âˆ©{Bs â‰¤x})
P0,u,b(A+
0 )

.
(A.21)
Now, by using (A.2), we note that, by possibly taking b > 0 large enough depending on k and a, it
holds that
P0,u,b(A+
0 ) â‰¥P0,u,b(Ï„âˆ’Î¶a,k(0) > b) â‰¥2Î¶a,k(0)(u + Î¶a,k(0))
b

1 âˆ’Î¶a,k(0)(u + Î¶a,k(0))
b

â‰¥Î¶a,k(0)(u + Î¶a,k(0))
b
,
By using this estimate along with Lemma A.8, we obtain that there exists a constant c3 = c3(a) such
that, for all x â‰¥Î¶a,k(s),
P0,u,b(A+
0 âˆ©{Bs â‰¤x})
P0,u,b(A+
0 )
â‰¤c3
