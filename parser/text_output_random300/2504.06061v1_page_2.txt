FIG. 1. Schematic view of a host system for two-dimensional
TMW. A 2DES with homogeneous carrier density is subject
to temperature gradient in x-direction, which leads to forma-
tion of compensating electric field. No charge carrier drift is
present. The structure is sandwiched between dielectrics with
permittivities ε1, ε2. The main part of the paper deals with
the case ε1 = ε2 for simplicity.
Assume that an isothermal wave δχeikr−|kzz|−iωt is lo-
calized near 2DES sandwiched between two dielectrics
(see Fig. 1) and its magnitude δχ is small (δχ can be any
quantity associated with the wave). Here k is the wave
vector in the 2DES plane, kz is responsible for wave local-
ization near 2DES plane z = 0, ω is the wave frequency.
Linearizing Eq.(2) we arrive at
δE = ρ0δj + α1∇T × δH,
(3)
With the help of the Faraday’s law the above equation
can be cast into the form
δj = ˆσT MδE,
(4)
where the effective ”thermomagnetic” conductivity ˆσ is
given by
ˆσT M = σ0

where Ω= −α1c(k, ∇T) is the a typical TMW frequency
(compare with Eq. (1)). The derived conductivity ten-
sor is asymmetric, which is a natural consequence of a
selected direction in the system (parallel to ∇T).
Now our goal is to search for eigen modes in the scheme
of Fig. 1 with 2DES conductivity ˆσT M. The derivation
closely follow the derivation of 2D GMW spectrum [6].
We define area z > 0 be area I and area z < 0 be area II
and let ε1 = ε2 = ε for simplicity (the asymmetric case
ε1 ̸= ε2 does not qualitatively affect the results, see the
Discussion section). Then we search for eigenmodes in
the form of linear combination of TE and TM waves:

where TEI,II and TMI,II are the amplitudes of TE and
TM electric field in the corresponding areas,
EI,II(r, t) = exp (ik cos αx + ik sin αy ∓kzz −iωt) , (8)
α is the angle between the wave vector and the thermal
gradient direction, kz =

0, and k0 = ω/c.
Then we evaluate the corresponding magnetic fields via
the Faraday’s law and apply the boundary conditions on
the tangential components of the electric and magnetic
fields. As a result, we arrive at a linear system which
acquires diagonal form if we change variables to TE± =
1/2(TEI ± TEII) and TM± = 1/2(TMI ± TMII):

It can be easily checked that det ˆ
M1 = 0 only when
kz = 0, which makes the waves divergent at z = ±∞. So,
we conclude that TE−= TM+ = 0, or TEI = TEII =
