applied to H →b¯b [279] and e+e−→3 jets [281–283]. Extended to the case of colourless
final states in hadron collisions [284] with a public implementation for H production in
the code NNLOCAL [285].
– Nested soft–collinear subtraction [286–288]:
Fully local subtraction with analytic results for integrated subtraction counterterms. Worked
out for processes with hadronic initial and final states [289–291].
Applied to compute
NNLOQCD corrections to VH [292] and VBF [293], as well as mixed QCD–EW correc-
tions to the Drell–Yan process [294–296]. The first step towards a generalization of this
method was taken in Ref. [297], where the analytical cancellation of IR singularities in the
production of arbitrarily many gluons in quark–antiquark annihilation was demonstrated.
Further development for additional partonic channels is underway.
– Local analytic sector subtraction [298–300]:
Local subtraction with analytic integration of the counterterms aiming to combine the
respective advantages from two NLO approaches of FKS subtraction [164,165] and dipole
subtraction [280]. First proof-of-principle results for e+e−→2 jets were presented in [298].
The analytic pole cancellation in fully differential observables in the production of arbi-
trarily many massless partons in e−e+ collisions was demonstrated in Ref. [301]. Progress
towards hadronic initial states is underway [302]. The first steps towards an extension to
N3LOQCD were taken in Ref. [303], where the architecture of infrared subtraction in full
generality and the organisation of relevant counterterms was presented.
– Projection to Born [304]:
Requires the knowledge of inclusive calculations that retain the full differential information
with respect to Born kinematics. With the necessary ingredients in place, generalisable to
any order. Applied at NNLOQCD to VBF [304], Higgs-pair production [305], and t-channel
single top production [260, 306]. Fully differential N3LOQCD predictions obtained for jet
production in DIS [307,308], H →b¯b [309], and Higgs production in gluon fusion [310].

Update on the precision Standard Model wish list
This section is divided in four parts which comprise: Higgs-boson associated processes, jet final
states, vector-boson associated processes, and top-quark associated processes.
The terms of the expansion are defined with respect to the Born contribution and expanded
in the QCD and electroweak couplings as:
dσX = dσLO
X

Note that Eq. (2) only applies to cases where the leading-order process is uniquely defined
through the powers of the respective couplings. In the following, the notation NLOSM is used
to denote NLO calculations that include the full Standard Model corrections, i.e., all QCD and
EW corrections to all leading-order contributions.
Given that the fields of resummation and parton showers have seen tremendous progress in
the past years, we feel that it warrants a specific document.4 The interested reader may consult
Ref. [311] for an overview. Nonetheless, where relevant, we provide the recent developments in
parton shower and resummation that are relevant for the given process.
