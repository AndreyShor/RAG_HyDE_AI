Bayesian network for an product environment channel (lemma 7) and agent with independently and uniformly
distributed actions (see eq. (G45)) used in the proof of Lemma 9.
Proof: Recall eq. (G43), the expression for work rate for a product environment channel:
W(agtM →
←env) = ⟨H (At|Mt)⟩t −h (S) −⟨I [S0:tA0:t+1; St|Mt]⟩t .
(G49)
First assume that agtM ∈A
→
←env
mea ∩A
→
←env
pred . By Definition 14, agents in A
→
←env
mea fulfill
⟨H (At|Mt)⟩t = log |A|,
(G50)
and, by Definition 12 agents in A
→
←env
pred fulfill
0 = ⟨I [S0:tA0:t+1; St|Mt]⟩t .
(G51)
Plugging eqs. (G50) and (G51) into eq. (G49) yields W(agtM →
←env) = log|Y| −h(S) which equals the work capacity
of unifilar product environment channels according to Lemma 9, and thus agtM ∈A
→
←env
eff
.
For the other direction, assume agtM ∈A
→
←env
eff
. Then,
0 = Cwork(env) −W(agtM →
←env)
(G52)
= log |A| −⟨H (At|Mt)⟩t −⟨I [S0:tA0:t+1; St|Mt]⟩t
(G53)
where for the second line we used the expressions for work capacity of product environment channels (Lemma 9) and
extractable work of agents using a product environment channel (eq. (G49)).
Note that −⟨I [S0:tA0:t+1; St|Mt]⟩t is upper bounded by zero and ⟨H (At|Mt)⟩t is upper bounded by log |A|. The
expression in eq. (G53) is thus upper bounded by zero. Thus, agtM must be such that both upper bounds are reached.
By Definition 14, the set of agents which reach the upper bound for ⟨H (At|Mt)⟩t is A
→
←env
mea , and, by Definition 12, the
set of agents which reach the upper bound for −⟨I [S0:tA0:t+1; St|Mt]⟩t is A
→
←env
pred . It follows that agtM ∈A
→
←env
mea ∩A
→

pred .□
Theorem 9 shows that efficient agents should be constructed such that they are predictive whenever the environment
is modeled by a unifilar product environment channel.
This, however, is no longer true for general environment
channels. We first prove the following lemma which shows properties for a particular memoryless environment channel.
Lemma 10. Let environment env be a memoryless environment channel and such that At and St take values in an
alphabet A = S = {0, 1}. Let the environment’s transition matrix Φenv = (ϕenv(j|i))j,i with j, i ∈A be such that
ϕenv(j|0) = δ0,j and ϕenv(j|1) = 1/2 for j = 0, 1. Then, for any agtM →
←env we have
⟨I [At; St|Mt]⟩t = 0 ⇔⟨H (At|Mt)⟩t = 0.
(G54)
Proof.
First note that if an agent model agtM admits ⟨H (At|Mt)⟩t = 0, then
⟨I [At; St|Mt]⟩t = ⟨H (At|Mt)⟩t −⟨H (At|MtSt)⟩t = 0,
(G55)
where we used the definition of mutual information (eq. (A6)), and the conclusion follows from the nonnegativity of
conditional mutual information and conditional entropy, proving one direction of eq. (G54).
