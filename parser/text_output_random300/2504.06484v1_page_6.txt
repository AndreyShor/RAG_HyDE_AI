The real factor µ in our squeezing scheme is larger than
unity and, according to the relation G = µG, our scheme
needs less power if we set the same G and G respectively
with and without squeezing effect.
Power Regime.— The driven powers Pa and P± are
acquired to respectively generate the magnon-mechanical
coupling G and squeezing strength λ via the correspond-
ing driving amplitudes as |Ea| =
p
Paκa/ℏωa and |E±| =
p
P±κb/ℏωb. They determine the enhanced factors A0
and B± for magnon-mechanical coupling G and squeezing
strength λ according to Eq. (7), obtained by the steady
equations (5). Thus, without loss of generality, we choose
the relations as

with the optimal phase sin θ = −1 in (28) and negative
parameter k.
For solving Eqs. (5), the bare coupling strengths should
be calculated. The tripartite coupling for magnon, mi-
crowave, and mechanical modes is given by [46]

with the physical constants as gyromagnetic ratio γ0 =
2π × 28 GHz/T, vacuum permeability µ0
=
4π ×
10−7 N/A2, YIG’s ground-state spin number s = 5/2,
and its spin density ρs = 4.22 × 1027 /m3 and mass den-
sity ρm = 5170 kg/m3. Besides, we assume other typ-
ical and reasonable frequencies as ωa = ωb = 30 GHz
and ωc = 30 kHz.
The volume of the cavity mode is
Va = 0.04 × 0.02 × 0.008 m3 and the volume of the YIG
sphere is needless in this part. Thus, the coupling rate
becomes g/2π = 4.55 × 10−7 Hz. On the other hand, the
self-Kerr coefficient of magnon mode is given by [50]
k = 13ℏKanγ2

4M 2Vs
,
(37)
with the first-order magnetocrystalline anisotropy con-
stant Kan = −610 J/m3 and saturation magnetization
[59] (i.e., magnetization per unit volume) M = ℏγ0ρss.
For a typical radius of macromagnet with rm = 100 µm,
the self-Kerr coefficient of magnon mode (37) is about
k/2π ≈−6.42 × 10−9 Hz.
Based on the typical pa-
rameters mentioned above, the relations in (7) and (35),
and the optimal squeezing condition (30), we can solve
the steady equations (5) and the powers required are
thus obtained as Pa ≈0.17 mW, P+ ≈0.07 mW, and
P−≈0.14 mW.
Conclusions.— We have proposed an effective scheme
to enhance the cooling of the center-of-mass motion of
a YIG sphere inside a microwave cavity, where the in-
tracavity mode is intensively coupled to both magnon
mode in YIG sphere and mechanical mode. This scheme
is based on the magnon self-Kerr nonlinearity that is
mapped into degenerate squeezing by appropriate driving
pumps. The optimal parameters, especially the squeezing
rate, which we present in detail have found to generate
more efficient cooling than the previous work, even in the
sideband-unresolved regime. We also study the optimal
cavity-enhanced coupling of magnon mode to mechani-
cal mode. Eventually, combined with the above results,
the pump powers are given for realizing the typical sys-
tem. Our proposal may raise the possibility to generate
the quantum ground state towards fundamental tests on
quantum physics and technology applications in quantum
regime.
