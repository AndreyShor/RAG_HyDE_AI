tion as
W = Ω+ TS .

One immediately recognizes that there is another relation
for the state function W, that is,
W = U −µBNB ,
(3)
resulting from the general thermodynamical relations,
where U denotes the energy.
Inserting Eq. (2) into
Eq. (1), one arrives at
dW = TdS −pdV −NBdµB ,
(4)
indicating that W is a state function of S, V and µB.
Then we discuss the theoretical connection to experi-
mental measurement. In experimental measurements of
mean transverse momentum fluctuations, finite accep-
tance cuts in the rapidity (y) and transverse momentum
(pT ) range are applied, which signifies that the system
volume and the chemical potential in Eq. (4) are approx-
imately constant.
While this approximation holds for
high-energy collisions, we note that µB may vary in low-
energy regions, e.g., fixed target collisions at RHIC, due
to global baryon number conservation effects [25, 50, 51].
For the present study, we neglect these corrections and
maintain the constant approximation.
The experimental measurement of mean transverse
momentum fluctuations is performed at a fixed multi-
plicity of charged particles Nch. Since Nch scales directly
with the entropy of the system (Nch ∼S). Consequently,
the state function W in Eq. (4) becomes the appropri-
ate thermodynamic potential for describing these exper-
imental observables, as its natural variables directly cor-
respond to the constrained quantities in the measures.
Temperature fluctuations derivations.
Having estab-
lished the relevance of the state function W in Eq. (4) for
heavy-ion collisions, we now derive the temperature fluc-
tuations, or equivalently, the mean transverse momen-
tum fluctuations of charged particles, computed from the
derivative of W w.r.t. S for different orders.
For a fixed volume V , we define the intensive quan-
tities: the thermodynamic potential density w = W/V
and the entropy density s = S/V , one arrives at
w = −p + Ts ,
(5)
where Ω= −pV is used and the entropy density can be
obtained from s =
∂p
∂T . The first-order derivative of w
w.r.t. s produces the temperature
∂w
∂s = T .
(6)
Then, the n-th order fluctuation of temperature is ob-
tained from the n-th order derivatives of w w.r.t. s, to
wit,
⟨(∆T)n⟩= T 4n−4 ∂nw
∂sn ,
(7)
with ∆T = T −⟨T⟩and n ≥2 (n ∈Z), where ⟨· · · ⟩
denotes the ensemble average. It is convenient to adopt
a dimensionless temperature fluctuation
cn = ⟨(∆T)n⟩
T n
.
(8)
The cumulants cn can be expressed in terms of temper-
ature derivatives of the pressure through fundamental
thermodynamic relations. The first three nontrivial or-
ders corresponding to the variance, skewness, and kurto-
sis of temperature fluctuations, are given by,
