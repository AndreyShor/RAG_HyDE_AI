2.6 Human brain activity test 
We applied the proposed DL model combined with the SPAD sensor to evaluate cerebral perfusion 
differences during a simple brain activation paradigm (eating lunch). Specifically, a healthy adult 
male (29 years old) recorded CBFi using our system before and after the lunch. Experimental 
details are provided in Sec. 2.3. CBFi measurements were taken 30 minutes before and 5, 30, 75, 
and 120 minutes post-meal to assess digestion-induced cerebral perfusion changes. In each test 
phase, 5000 frames of autocorrelation data were collected. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a custom 3D-
printed probe was used to hold the source and detector fibers, which were attached to the 
participant’s forehead with an adjustable Velcro strap. During the test, the power density from the 
source fiber tip was attenuated to remain below the Maximum Permissible Exposure limit set by 
the American Laser Safety Standard (<300 mW/mm² for 785 nm)50. The participant wore laser 
safety goggles to prevent laser exposure to the eyes. Ethical approval was granted by the 
Biomedical Engineering Departmental Ethics Committee at the University of Strathclyde.

Results 
3.1 Noise characterization 
Fig. 5 (a) shows an example of detected blood flow changes during a pulse cycle, recovered using 
single-exponential fitting. The fitting method is employed to illustrate how CBFi changes over a 
pulse cycle affect the measured signal. Fig. 5 (b) presents the scaled measured ACF and the 
corresponding fitted decay curves at the peak and trough in Fig. 5 (a). Fig. 5 (c) displays the 
difference, ∆= 𝑥𝑥(𝜏𝜏) − 𝑓𝑓(𝜏𝜏), calculated at the peak and trough. Fig. 5 (d) is the standard deviation 
𝜎𝜎 calculated over 5,000 frames, which serves as the noise model for generating synthetic noise 
(see Sec. 2.2.). 
We scaled the SPAD ACF data before noise characterization (using Eq. 8) to match the training 
input format. Because the SPAD’s autocorrelator uses linear lag spacing, the noise standard 
deviation is expected to follow an exponential decay45. Indeed, in Fig. 5 (d) the standard deviation 
is lower at the first and last lag points compared to the middle; we believe this occurs due to our 
scaling and the rapid decay of the 𝑔𝑔2  curve over the initial lag range at high flow rates. 
Additionally, since the correlation time ranges from 1.28 µs to 39.68 µs, corresponding to the very 
beginning of a full 𝑔𝑔2 decay, so the correlation values drop off very rapidly (especially for high 
flow). Consequently, the first point of the scaled SPAD ACF is 1.5 (by design of the scaling).
