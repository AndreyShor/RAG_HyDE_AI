where we recall that α =

We are now ready to state the following key lemma whose proof is given in Section 7.2.
Lemma 7.2. For any λ > 0, R ≥1, and ε > 0, there exist 0 ≤A < L sufficiently large such that there
exists b0 > 0 and s0 > 0 sufficiently large, such that for any s ≥s0 satisfying (es + 1)/(R + 1) ∈N
and any b ≥b0, there exists a sufficiently large T ≥0 such that for all t ≥T and any function
χ : [0, R]d →R satisfying the conditions in (6.6), it holds that

 ≤ε ρχ([0, R]d) ,
where we recall that the measure ρχ is defined in (6.5).
Remark 7.3. We emphasise that in the statement of Lemma 7.2, the conditions (6.6) on the function
χ : [0, R]d →R depends on s.
Thanks to Lemma 7.2, to prove Proposition 6.1 it suffices to derive an explicit expression for the
constant Cλ
A,L,b defined in (7.7) as the cutoff parameters are taken to infinity, and then show that this
expression coincides with Tγ defined in (6.1), up to a multiplicative constant. To this end, for A,
L ≥0 and 0 ≤k < b, recalling that α =
√
2/π, we define the constant Cλ,new
A,L,k,b by letting

where we emphasise that the only difference from Fλ
k,x, as defined in (7.1), is the presence of the
maximum in the denominator. Note that, with a slight abuse of our previous notation, we have
absorbed the expectation with respect to the field gu+x
b
into the expectation E0,u,b.
We can now state the second key lemma of this section whose proof is given in Section 7.3.
Lemma 7.4. For any λ > 0, ε > 0, and A ≥0, there exists L ≥0 sufficiently large, such that there
exists k0 ≥0 for which, for all k ≥k0, there exists b0 ≥0 sufficiently large such that for all b ≥b0, it
holds that
|Cλ

A,L,k,b| ≤ε .
The proof of Proposition 6.1 follows by combining Lemmas 7.2 and 7.4.
Proof of Proposition 6.1. Let R ≥1 and λ ∈Λ, where we recall that the set Λ is introduced in
Lemma 5.1. For any ε > 0, thanks to Lemmas 7.2 and 7.4, by taking the involved parameters large
enough as specified in the statements of the aforementioned lemmas, we have that
