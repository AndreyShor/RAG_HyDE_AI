From QUBOs to Max-Cut Problems. Given the QUBO associated with matrix 𝑄∈R𝑛×𝑛, the 𝑛+ 1 adjacency
matrix 𝐴given by

A derivation of this mapping can be found in Appendix A.
The graph with adjacency matrix 𝐴is called the corresponding graph of 𝑄. The corresponding graph allows
for QUBOs to be mapped to Max-Cut problems. A similar mapping was mentioned in [17].
2.1.2
Max-Cut Relaxations. The benefit of mapping QUBOs to Max-Cut problems is that we can make use of
well-known relaxations.
Relaxing the Max-Cut cost function (3, with 𝐽= −𝐴/4) by introducing 𝑌𝑖∈R𝑘with ∥𝑌𝑖∥= 1 is given by

where 𝑌is a matrix with columns 𝑌𝑖. The Goemans Williamson GW relaxation [7] is derived from the special
case where 𝑘= 𝑛. In this case, 𝑌𝑇𝑌is a positive semidefinite symmetric matrix with unit diagonal. If we replace
the matrix 𝑌𝑇𝑌with a general matrix 𝑀, then the relaxed QUBO is
−1
4 max
𝑀∈S𝑛tr(𝐴𝑀),
where S𝑛is the set of positive semidefinite symmetric matricies with unit diagonals.
Notably, this optimization problem is QUBO-Relaxed, and can thus be exactly solved [18]. Given a solution 𝑀,
we find the Cholesky decomposition 𝑀= 𝑌𝑇𝑌. If we let 𝑘= 2 or 𝑘= 3, then we obtain the Burer-Monteiro BM
relaxations, BM2 and BM3 respectively [19].
In the case of the BM2 relaxation, we can express each column vector 𝑌𝑖in polar coordinates, i.e., 𝑌can be
parameterized it in terms of 𝜃∈[0, 2𝜋)𝑛, giving
𝑌𝑖= [cos(𝜃𝑖), sin(𝜃𝑖)]𝑇.
(10)
Likewise for BM3 relaxation, each𝑌𝑖can be expressed in spherical coordinates, i.e., we can take𝑌and parameterize
it in terms of 𝜃∈[0, 𝜋]𝑛,𝜙= [0, 2𝜋)𝑛, giving
𝑌𝑖= [sin(𝜃𝑖) cos(𝜙𝑖), sin(𝜃𝑖) sin(𝜙𝑖), cos(𝜃𝑖)]𝑇.
(11)
Unlike the GW relaxation, solving for 𝑌is no longer a QUBO-Relaxed problem. Instead we use randomized
stochastic perturbations with (step size 𝜂) to solve this problem as in [5, 6].
