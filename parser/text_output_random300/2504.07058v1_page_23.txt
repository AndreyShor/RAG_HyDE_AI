1D linear Burgess equation
The model for linear brain tumor growth given in [20,38] is analyzed:
𝜕𝑢
𝜕𝑡= 1
2
𝜕2𝑢
𝜕𝑥2 + 𝑢(𝑡, 𝑥),
(3.18)
subject to the conditions:
𝑢(0, 𝑥) = 𝑥,
𝑢(𝑡, 0) = 0,
𝑢(𝑡, 1) = 𝑒𝑡,
(3.19)
where in Eq. (2.7), 𝑅(𝑡, 𝑥) = 𝑢(𝑡, 𝑥). The exact solution is:
𝑢(𝑡, 𝑥) = 𝑥𝑒𝑡.
(3.20)
Figure 15 presents a graphical comparison of the approximate solutions computed using PINN and the exact
solution for the model defined by Eq. (3.18). The results confirm that the PINN-based approximation closely
matches the exact solution, demonstrating its stability. Furthermore, Fig. 15 illustrates the growth in tumor
cell density as time 𝑡advances. A three-dimensional representation comparing the PINN and exact solutions is
shown in Fig. 16. Additionally, Table 7 reports the relative error E𝑟
𝐺and training error E𝑇along with the selected
hyper-parameters. The zoom view of the plot at 𝑡= 0.5 clearly illustrates that the PINN prediction is closer to
the exact solution than the Fibonacci and Haar wavelet methods [38].

1D extended Fisher–Kolmogorov equation
The 1D case of the EFK model is given as follows:
𝑢𝑡+ 𝛾𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥−𝑢𝑥𝑥+ 𝑢3 −𝑢= 𝑓,
(3.21)
(3.22)
The exact solution [1]is :
𝑢(𝑡, 𝑥) = exp (−𝑡) sin(𝜋𝑥).
(3.23)
The corresponding source term is:
𝑓(𝑡, 𝑥) = exp (−𝑡) sin(𝜋𝑥)

𝛾𝜋4 + 𝜋2 −2 + exp(−2𝑡)(sin(𝜋𝑥))2
