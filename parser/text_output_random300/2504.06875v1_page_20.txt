7. Auger Peaks by AES and XPS 
 
Figure S5. Sn MNN and Te MNN peaks measured by (AR-)XPS (7 curves at bottom) and AES (2 curves at top) before 
sputtering (“oxidized”) and after sputtering (“metallic”). The relative scaling was adjusted for clarity. The (AR-)XPS spectra 
have the same scaling (not normalized). All XPS spectra have been referenced to the Fermi level on the binding energy scale 
and were then converted back to the kinetic energy scale using the following equation: 𝐸𝑘= ℎ𝜈−𝐸𝑏−𝜙. 
 
8. Influence of the Interface Sharpness 
 
Figure S6. Systematic underestimation of the overlayer thickness by the single-energy model with increasing interface 
broadness: (a) Theoretical SnO overlayer thickness on SnTe according to the single-energy model (eq. 1) as a function of 
the emission angle. The intensity ratios on which these results are based were calculated using the multiple-energies model 
(eq. 3) with constant 𝑑= 2 and varying 𝑘 values in nm-1. Shaded regions indicate standard deviation of the results from 
different emission peaks. The lines are fits (𝑦= 𝑎−𝑏𝑐𝑥) and serve as a guide to the eye. (b) Difference between the result 
of the single-energy model (eq. 1) and the nominal oxide layer thickness 𝑑= 2 as a function of interface sharpness 𝑘. The 
color scheme is the same as in (a). The inset shows the corresponding concentration profiles defined by 𝐶𝑆𝑛2+(𝑧) = 0.5 ∙
𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑐(𝑘∙(𝑧−𝑑)) ∙100%. Mind that profiles with values of 𝑘< 0.5 should not be modelled as two distinct layers with 
defined EAL and atomic number densities. Since eq. 3 reduces to eq. 1 in the limit 𝑘→∞, it is not surprising that eq. 1 
yields increasingly accurate results for increasing values of 𝑘, i.e. sharper interfaces.
