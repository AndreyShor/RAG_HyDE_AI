Let Λ0 : C →CC′′ be a map which copies system C to another register C′′. This gives the state
|τ⟩CQRR′C′C′′
=
X
c
√pc |c⟩C ⊗|ωc⟩QRR′
⊗|c⟩C′
⊗|c⟩C′′
,
(11)
and the mutual information evaluates to
I(CQ : RR′C′)τ = S(CQ)τ + S(RR′C′)τ −S(CQRR′C′)τ
= S(CQ)τ + S(CC′′Q)τ −S(C′′)τ
= S(CQ)ω + S(CQ)ω −S(C)ω,
where the second follows since the overall state on CQRR′C′C′′ is pure. The last equality follows because C′′ is a
copy of C. This implies that 2a(ωCNQR, 0) ≥2S(CQ)ω −S(C)ω. Now, we show that Λ0 : C →C′′ is optimal. By
KI-theorem the isometric extension UΛ of any CPTP map Λ : CQ →CQ that preserves ωCQR can only act as follows
|ν⟩CQRR′C′M = (UΛ ⊗11RR′) |ω⟩CQRR′
=
X
c
√pc |c⟩C ⊗|ωc⟩QRR′
⊗|c⟩C′
⊗|vc⟩M .

Hence, the mutual information is bounded as
I(CQ : RR′C′)ν = S(CQ)ν + S(RR′C′)ν −S(CQRR′C′)ν
= S(CQ)ν + S(CMQ)ν −S(M)ν
= S(CQ)ω + S(CQ)ω + S(M|C)ω −S(M)ν,
= S(CQ)ω + S(CQ)ω −S(M)ν,
in the third line the S(M|C)ω = 0 because the state on M given C = c is pure. In the last line S(M)ν is maximized
if |vc⟩M are orthogonal, that is S(M)ν = S(C)ν.

UNASSISTED SIMULATION
In this section, we obtain achievability and converse bounds for the unassisted qubit rate. The unassisted model
refers to the case where the encoder and decoder do not share or distill any entanglement, namely registers A0, A1, B0
and B1 are trivial registers.
Theorem 8. For the unassisted simulation of the channel N : A →BK, the following regularized rate is achievable
where u(ρ, γ) is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3

Proof. The proof of the direct part is as follows. Consider m copies of the state ρAR as a single state and the optimal
