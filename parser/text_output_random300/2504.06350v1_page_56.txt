Relation between SDI and DI. Just as the violation of a Bell inequality in the DI case tells us that
the measured system cannot have a classical description, the violation of a dimension witness in the
SDI case tells us that the communicated system cannot be a classical bit. In both cases, violation of
the classical bound is a necessary (though not always sufficient) condition, with the difference residing
in the form of the inequalities.
Finding the correspondence between these two objects is equivalent
to finding the correspondence between the scenarios.
A typical bell inequality I can be written as
I = P
a,b,x,y αa,b,x,yP(a, b|x, y).
Using the relation p(a, b|x, y) = p(a|x, y)p(b|a, x, y), then I can be
rewritten as P
a,b,x,y αa,b,x,yp(a|x, y)p(b|a, x, y).
By considering a as an input of Alice (x′ = (x, a)),
p(a|x, y) can be seen as the part of Alice’s input is a. Since in the parameter estimation phase of the
protocol the inputs are chosen according to a uniform distribution, we set P(a|x, y) = 1
A, where A is the
size of the alphabet of a. Then, the Bell inequality I takes the form of a dimension witness. Using this
method, the method for going from SDI to DI and vice versa was introduced in [303]. For going from SDI
to DI, Alice’s input x must be divided into a pair comprising a setting and an outcome. Let us consider
the SDI randomness generation (based on n →1 quantum random access code q) where Alice input x′ is
a collection of n independent bits a0, · · · , an−1. For this case, Alice’s input can be divided into pairs of
outcome a = a0 and setting x = (a1, · · · , an−1) and a family of Bell inequalities can be obtained which
they were found useful to implement entanglement-assisted random access codes works in DI randomness
and DI-QKD protocols. The other side is also possible and one can show a DI protocol can be converted
to SDI protocol. The example of this conversion was also shown in [303].
Using a similar approach, Woodhead et al. [304] demonstrated that the fundamental bound on Alice’s
min-entropy in the DI setting also applies to the semi-DI setting. They achieved this by utilizing the
PM version of the CHSH correlator, defined as S = 1
2
P
abxy(−1)a+b+xyP(b|axy), instead of Eq. (11).
This result helps bring the semi-DI setting, where security proofs are still lacking, more in line with the
established security results for DI-QKD.
5.2. Receiver-device-independent QKD
Ioannou et al. introduced another prepare-and-measure SDI-QKD protocol [305], where the sender’s
device is partially trusted, while the receiver’s device is treated as a black box. They called these proto-
cols “receiver-device-independent quantum key distribution (RDI-QKD).” The main assumption in RDI
protocols is to bound the pairwise (possibly complex) overlaps between the various states prepared by
Alice, denoted as γij = ⟨ψi| ψj⟩. The states |ψx⟩represent the quantum systems prepared by Alice’s
devices or, more generally, the states of all systems outside Alice’s lab, conditioned on her applying the
preparation sequence labeled by x. If Alice’s states are mixed, their purifications must also satisfy the
overlap bounds. These bounds prevent any side-channel from leaking additional information about x to
Eve. No characterization of the receiver’s (Bob’s) device is required, and no fair-sampling assumption is
made. As a result, these protocols are resilient to attacks where Eve controls Bob’s device.
5.2.1. Protocols
Simplest protocol. In the simplest protocol, given a key bit k, Alice prepares one of two possible states
by setting x = k. using a coherent state |α⟩with two possible polarization states |ϕx⟩= cos θ
2 |H⟩+
eiπx sin θ
2 |V ⟩, she prepares one of the following states (x = 0, 1)
|ψx⟩= |α cos θ
2⟩
H |α sin
θ
2

eiπx⟩
V
.
(158)
The overlap between two preparation is given by ⟨ψ1| ψ0⟩= e−2|α|2 sin2 θ and the main assumption is
then written as
γ = ⟨ψ1| ψ0⟩≥C,
(159)
where C is a parameter chosen by the user.
Bob, then, performs a measurement of the polarization states. For y = 0 (y = 1), he projects the incoming
signal to |ϕ⊥
0 ⟩(|ϕ⊥
1 ⟩). If he gets a click, then the round is conclusive and he outputs b = 0, otherwise, the
round is inconclusive and he outputs b = 1 and the round will be discarded during sifting. In the case of
an ideal channel without noise and loss, the following statistics will be observed by Alice and Bob
p(b = 0|x, y) = 1 −e−|α|2 sin (θ)2 sin ( π(x−y)
2
)
2
,
(160)
which is nonzero only when x ̸= y.
Therefore, the raw key can be constructed after removing the
inconclusive rounds, by Bob flipping all his bits.
