of a constant gravitational ﬁeld in two spatial dimensions that bounces off of a symmetric
wedge of angle 2θ, where this angle parametrizes the relative inequality of the masses [3].
Constructing a relativistic of the Hamiltonian (1) is somewhat subtle. This is the
subject of the next section.
3. Relativistic Gravity Coupled to Point Particles
In three spatial dimensions, a self-gravitating system would consist of a set of N
particles minimally coupled to Einstein gravity. Its action in n-dimensions is [31]

is the cosmological constant (whose sign +/−, respectively,
corresponds to asymptotically de Sitter/anti-de Sitter space–time), κn = 8πGn/c4 is the
gravitational coupling, and R is the Ricci scalar. Systems of astrophysical interest have
n = 4. Notwithstanding issues connected with collisions between the particles, the ﬁeld
equations that follow from this action embody what we expect from a self-gravitating
system: the curvature of space–time governs how the particles move along the trajectories
za(τa), and the masses and motion of these particles in turn govern how space–time
dynamically curves.
A ROGS that resembles a relativistic three-dimensional self-gravitating system as
closely as possible should therefore have the following features.
1.
The stress–energy of the particles generates a space–time curvature in as simple a
manner as possible.
2.
The curvature of space–time guides the motion of each particle in accordance with the
equivalence principle, in the absence of any extraneous forces.
3.
The dynamics of the system is self-consistent.
One might expect to obtain the ROGS by simply setting n = 2 in (6) (1 space dimension,
1 time dimension), but this will not work: the Ricci scalar is a total derivative in (1 + 1)
dimensions, in turn implying that the Einstein tensor is identically zero for any metric.
However, there is a way of taking the n →2 limit of the action (6) [28]. Consider
