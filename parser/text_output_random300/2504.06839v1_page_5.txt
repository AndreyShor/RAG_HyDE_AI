and, except for the initial datum µ0, this equation involves only µt(x, θ, s = 0, h), that is, the probability density of
the particles which collide at time t.
The first contribution ˜µ0 can be understood again as the probability density of the particles whose first collision
occurs at time t, while the second contribution F(µ)(t, x, θ, h) represents the probability density of the particles which
have collided at least one time before time t.
Therefore since F is a linear function of µ, we can formally write µt(x, θ, 0, h) as
µt(x, θ, 0, h) = ˜µ0(x, θ, t, h) +
∞
X
n=1
Fn(˜µ0)(x, θ, t, h),
where each term Fn(˜µ0)(x, θ, t, h) represents the probability density of the particles which have collided exactly n
times before time t. Going back to (1.1.7), the advantage of such a representation is that it makes sense not only for
regular initial data but for general L1 functions.
In the previous equation four variables are involved: (x, θ, s, h), but by integrating µt with respect to x or (x, θ),
one gets two new equations in the remaining variables.
Averaging on the position x.
By integrating µt with respect to x one gets

(1.1.8)
The same equation would appear by considering an initial datum which does not depend on x (of course this makes
sense only for x ∈T2 and not for x ∈R2), that is, if µ0 does not depend on x, the same holds for µt at any time t. Of
course, a solution of (1.1.8) admits also an alternative representation which does not include derivatives, that is,
µt(θ, s, h) = µ0(θ, s + t, h) +

(1.1.11)
One can notice again that if the initial datum µ0 does not depend on x (or (x, θ)), neither does µt at any time t, and
therefore the evolution of the probability density with respect to the remaining variables (s, h) is described by the
equation (1.1.8) (respectively (1.1.10)). In [7, 14] it has been proven that the only equilibria states for the equation
(1.1.10) in (s, h) are cE, for a constant c ∈R and E ∈L1([0, +∞) × [−1, 1]) introduced in Definition 1.2.
Moreover, since we already observed that a generalized solution of the three kinetic equations above exists also for
non regular initial data, we will use the following notation.
Definition 1.3. A solution of equation (1.1.6) (respectively (1.1.8) and (1.1.10)) with initial datum µ0 ∈L1(T2 ×
T1
2π × [0, +∞) × [−1, 1]) or µ0 ∈L1(R2 × T1
2π × [0, +∞) × [−1, 1]) (respectively µ0 ∈L1(T1
2π × [0, +∞) × [−1, 1]) and
µ0 ∈L1([0, +∞) × [−1, 1])) is a solution of (1.1.7) (respectively (1.1.9) and (1.1.11)).
Further literature.
Marklof-Strömbergsson [17] also provided asymptotic estimates (i.e., for s small and s large) for
the kernel Q and the invariant measure E in any dimension d ≥2, and these bounds (relying on the explicit formulation
of the transition kernel Q only in dimension d = 2) allowed to improve the estimates about the distribution of the
free path length in (1.1.2). In [18] the authors also generalized these asymptotic estimates and the time evolution law
(1.1.4) to the case of finite unions of lattices, while in [19] also the case of spherically symmetric finite-range potentials
has been studied. Moreover Marklof-Tóth [20] proved a superdiffusive limit (with normalization factor √t log t instead
of
√
t) for the continuous and discrete time displacement in any dimension d ≥2.
