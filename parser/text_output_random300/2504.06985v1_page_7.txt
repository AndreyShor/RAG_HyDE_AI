where chl,ri represents the 2l-form piece of the Chern character of representation ri (see
Appendix B). Notice that several terms are absent due to degree reasons; for instance, there
is no term with l odd, as they cannot be combined with a gravitational class to produce a
term of degree 12.
The basic question we wish to answer is under which conditions does the anomaly poly-
nomial (3.2) factorize in the form (2.7) suitable for M-theory anomaly cancellation. Clearly,
several coefficients must vanish. For instance, from (3.1) and properties of the Chern char-
acter, it follows that P
ri ch0,ri = P
ri nri dim(ri). Therefore, the last term on the right-hand
side of equation (3.2) certainly vanishes as long as
X
i
nridim(ri) = 248,
(3.3)
i.e. the total number of fermions, counted according to their chirality, should be 248.
To study the implications that factorization has for our problem, we will introduce some
notation. In general, Chern characters in different representations are not identical, but they
can be related to each other through group-theoretic factors [38, 39]. Thus, very generally,
one can write
chl,ri =
X
k
ulk
ri chl−k chk,
(3.4)
where chk denotes the components of the Chern character in some reference representation,
and ulk
ri is a matrix of coefficients. Notice that, unlike in the anomaly polynomial (3.2), these
expressions generally involve both even and odd components of the Chern character in the
reference representation. These matrix coefficients are related to a set of group-theoretical
constants related to the Dynkin index or equivalently to Casimir invariants of representations
described and computed in Appendix B. Therefore, using our general arrangement of matter
(3.1), properties of the Chern character such as P
ri chl,ri = P
ri nrichl,r, equations (B.4),
for an arbitrary representation r, we can express chl,r as combinations of Chern characters
