Abstract:
The moduli space of self-dual SU(N) Yang-Mills instantons on T4 of topological charge
Q = r/N, 1≤r≤N −1, is of current interest, yet is not fully understood. In this paper,
starting from ’t Hooft’s constant field strength (F) instantons, the only known exact solutions
on T4, we explore the moduli space via analytical and lattice tools.
These solutions are
characterized by two positive integers k, ℓ, k+ℓ=N, and are self-dual for T4 sides Lµ tuned
to kL1L2=rℓL3L4. For gcd(k, r)=r, we show, analytically and numerically (for N=3) that
the constant-F solutions are the only self-dual solutions on the tuned T4, with 4r holonomy
moduli.
In contrast, when gcd(k, r)̸=r, we argue that the self-dual constant-F solutions
acquire, in addition to the 4gcd(k, r) holonomies, 4r−4gcd(k, r) extra moduli, whose turning
on makes the field strength nonabelian and non-constant. Thus, for gcd(k, r) ̸= r, ’t Hooft’s
constant-F solutions are a measure-zero subset of the moduli space on the tuned T4, a fact
explaining a puzzle encountered in [1]. We also show that, for r=k=2, N=3, the agreement
between the approximate analytic solutions on the slightly detuned T4 and the Q = 2/3
self-dual configurations obtained by minimizing the lattice action is remarkable.
