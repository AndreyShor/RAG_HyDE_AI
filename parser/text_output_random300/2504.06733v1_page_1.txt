Abstract
Charge transfer is fundamentally dependent on the overlap of the orbitals com-
prising the transport pathway. This has key implications for molecular, nanoscale,
and quantum technologies, for which delocalization (and decoherence) rates are
essential figures of merit. Here, we apply the core hole clock technique – an
energy-domain variant of ultrafast spectroscopy – to probe the delocalization of
a photoexcited electron inside a closed molecular cage, namely the Ar 2p54s1
state of Ar@C60. Despite marginal frontier orbital mixing in the ground config-
uration, almost 80% of the excited state density is found outside the buckyball
due to the formation of a markedly diffuse hybrid orbital. Far from isolating the
intracage excitation, the surrounding fullerene is instead a remarkably efficient
conduit for electron transfer: we measure characteristic delocalization times of
6.6 ± 0.3 fs and ≲500 attoseconds, respectively, for a 3D Ar@C60 film and a 2D
monolayer on Ag(111).
