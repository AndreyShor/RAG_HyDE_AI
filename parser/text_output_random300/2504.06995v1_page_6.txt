length provided the best signal-to-noise ratio when run
through the full set of fibers in the cryostat. Figure 4
shows for comparison 660-nm beam spot images obtained
at 300 K and 10 mK, using the fiber-plate and APD read-
out scheme. Cross-checks were performed at 365 nm to
test for any wavelength dependence; the differences found
were even smaller than those observed in bench-top tests
performed with the focuser alone.
As shown in Figure
4, when the scanner was cooled
to 10 mK, the RMS spot-size decreased by ∼3%, and the
ratio of spot diameters along perpendicular axes changed
by ∼50%. The latter effect is consistent with a reduction
in the total optical path-length of ∼2 mm and the mea-
sured astigmatism shown in Figure 2. A ∼2 mm thermal
contraction is within expectations for an initial 203 mm
beam length constrained by an OFHC copper housing
cooled to 10 mK.

PULSE WIDTH MEASUREMENTS
To produce optical pulses with this device to character-
ize cryogenic MEMs performance, we drove the MEMS
mirror along one axis to sweep the focused beam spot
across the center of the optical fiber mounted to the exit
plate. We tested a variety of drive waveforms to study
the pulse width and shape in each case. While all cases
resulted in a roughly gaussian shape, we found that driv-
ing the mirror with a square wave produced the shortest
pulse duration, consistent with the highest angular beam
speed. There is a hardware low-pass filter in the MEMs
driver to prevent natural oscillation of the MEMs mirror
at its resonant frequency, as well as additional implicit
low-pass filtering due to the 2 m of twisted pair wiring
used to connect the driver to the cryogenic system. The
net result of this driving technique is an uncertainty in
the MEMs angular frequency produced by this drive sig-
nal - determining this frequency is one goal of our cryo-
genic chopping measurements.
For comparison, we can compute our expectation for a
pulse generated by a harmonically deflected MEMS mir-
ror along one axis at a rate ω. As shown in Appendix B,
for this geometry, the effective pulse time tpulse for trans-
mitted pulses can be written as:
tpulse ≈deff,meas
vbeam
= 122
p
1 + (0.31λ · 106)2
2θmωla
(6)
where θm is the maximum MEMs mirror deflection an-
gle, and la is the distance between the MEMS mirror and
the output spot. (See Figure 1.) The pulse length can be
minimized by making la as large as possible, while keep-
ing the converging beam spot within the MEMS mirror
diameter dr, giving:
tpulse ≥122µm
2θmωdr
p
1 + (0.31λ · 106)2 2NA

All of the parameter values in this equation are known
with one exception; we have only a notional idea of the
maximum safe angular drive frequency ω of the device
when cold.
As a proxy, we use the 300 K value of
the MEMS resonant frequency provided by the manu-
facturer: ωo/2π ∼330 Hz[15].
Of course, driving the
MEMS mirror too close to resonance risks damaging or
even destroying the unit, so as a precaution we generally
operate below ∼50% ωo, applying the digital low-pass
filter of 120 Hz specified by the manufacturer.
