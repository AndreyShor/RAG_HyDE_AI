where we’ve used the fact sin x ≃x in the |x| ≪1 limit.
We see the scalar ﬁeld is
frozen as long as mT < aH and then starts to oscillate while decaying as T. Notably, the
time integral and the power spectrum is scale-invariant in the scale we concerned, so the
momentum integral becomes trivial:

We can easily calculate the magnetic ﬁeld generated in our formalism.
Before the
annihilation event we have the Green’s function (3.31), so
