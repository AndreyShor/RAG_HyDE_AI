To determine the existence, number, and asymptotic properties of the zero modes, in agreement with our previous considerations
on the line gap nonhermitian topology and the definition of bulk topological invariant in Eq. (6), we define
ML,R =|Re(
q
v2
L,R + mL,R)| −|Re(vL,R)| =
|Re(qL,R)| −|Re(vL,R)|,
(11a)
KL,R =|Im(
q
v2
L,R + mL,R)| + |Im(vL,R)| =
|Im(qL,R)| + |Im(vL,R)|,
(11b)
WL,R =
(
sgn(Re(vL,R)),
if sgn(ML,R) = −1 or 0,
0
if sgn(ML,R) = 1,
(11c)
where we use the common convention sgn(0) = 0. We will refer to WL,R and ML,R as the (nonhermitian) topological
invariant and the (nonhermitian) topological mass on the left and right side of the smooth domain wall, respectively. These
quantities depend only on the values of the fields mL,R and vL,R at large distances |x| > w. For the asymptotically hermitian
case Im(mL,R) = Im(vL,R) = 0, one has that sgn(ML,R) = sgn(mL,R), KL,R = |Im(qL,R)|, and WL,R = sgn(vL,R) for
mL,R ≤0 and WL,R = 0 otherwise. Hence, our definitions of nonhermitian topological mass ML,R and nonhermitian topological
invariant WL,R in Eqs. (11) and (11c) reduces to the usual definition of topological mass and topological invariant in the hermitian
case.
To demonstrate the relations between the (nonhermitian) topological invariants WL,R and the existence and number of zero
modes, we start to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the Jackiw-Rebbi equation. Since the two solutions decay
as |φs
1,2(x →−∞)| = eRe(α±
L )x and φs
1,2(x →+∞) = e−Re(α∓
R)x, the boundary conditions on the left are satisfied when
Re(α±
L) > 0 while the boundary conditions on the right are satisfied when Re(α∓
R) > 0, respectively for the two solutions
φs
1,2(x). To determine whether the solutions satisfy the boundary conditions, we thus need to study the sign of the exponents
Re(α±
L,R). For mL, vL ∈C, these exponents are completely determined by the quantities ML and KL, since
sgn(Re(α±
L)) =



±1,
for ML > 0,
0 or −sWL,
for ML = 0,
−sWL,
for ML < 0.
(12)
In the first case, the solution φs
1(x) decays while the solution φs
2(x) diverges for x →−∞. In the second case, one of the solutions
φs
1,2(x) converges to a constant value. In the last case, both solutions φs
1,2(x) decays for x →−∞as long as s = −sgn(Re(vL)).
Analogous statements hold for α±
R by exchanging left and right vL →vR, mL →mR, WL →WR, ML →MR, and s →−s.
We are now ready to demonstrate the nonhermitian generalization of the bulk-boundary correspondence. To do so, we will
demonstrate that the number of localized zero-energy modes in the interval −∞< x < ∞(infinite system) equals |WL −WR|,
and that the number of localized zero-energy modes in the interval 0 ≤x < ∞(semi-infinite system) is equal to |WR|.
B.
Infinite interval −∞< x < ∞
Zero modes on the interval −∞< x < ∞satisfying the boundary conditions φ(±∞) = 0 are given by the modes φs
1,2(x) in
Eq. (7) with Re(α±
L) > 0 and Re(α±
R) > 0. In this case, there exists |WL −WR| zero modes, i.e., there are two independent
modes if WLWR = −1, one independent mode if WL = ±1 and WR = 0 or if WR = ±1 and WL = 0. To demonstrate these
statements, we need to find the particular solutions that satisfy φ(x →±∞) = 0, i.e., φ(y →0) = φ(y →1) = 0. Assuming
|F1,2(y)| convergent or logarithmically divergent at y = 0, 1, we need to care about the factors ywα−
L and (1 −y)wα−
R, which
converge to zero at y = 0 and y = 1 only if Re(α−
L) > 0 and Re(α−
R) > 0, respectively. This gives only four possible outcomes,
discussed below and summarized in Table II.
1.
Two zero modes for WLWR = −1
For sgn(ML) = sgn(MR) = −1, and Re(vL)Re(vR) < 0, the topological invariants are opposite and nonzero WLWR =
−1. Moreover, in this case, one has sgn(Re(α±
L)) = −s sgn(Re(vL)) and sgn(Re(α±
R)) = s sgn(Re(vR)), which gives
sgn(Re(α±
L)) = sgn(Re(α±
R)) in this case. Choosing the pseudospin s = sgn (Re(vL)) = −sgn Re((vR)) gives Re(svL) > 0
and Re(svR) < 0 and therefore Re(α±
L), Re(α±
R) < 0: In this case, the two linearly independent solutions φs
1,2(x) in Eq. (A11)
diverge exponentially with different decaying lengths at x →±∞, and their linear combination cannot satisfy the boundary
