be expanded too as,
ϵ = ξaPa + 1

Combining the relations (48), (49) and (50) one can obtain the transformation properties of
the various gauge fields,

As mentioned earlier, in our treatment, the resulting gauge group is determined by the
SSB of the gauge group SO(2, 4). However, in addition, we have to guarantee the equivalence
of the gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms. This requirement, as we shall see below,
leads to the vanishing of the torsion and curvature tensors generalised in the present case as
compared to those of the corresponding Poincar´e case.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking
We shall start by choosing the parity conserving action, which is quadratic in terms of the
field strength tensor (56), in which we have introduced a scalar that belongs in the adjoint
rep, 15, of SU(4) ∼SO(6) ∼SO(2, 4) along with a dimensionful parameter, m:
SSO(2,4) = aCG
