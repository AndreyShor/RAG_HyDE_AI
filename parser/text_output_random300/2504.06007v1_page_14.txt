CAMulator
Figure 10: Annual mean temperature at the bottom model level in CAM6 (middle row) and CAMulator (top row) for
three sea surface temperature (SST) climatologies: 2000+0K (left column), 2000+2K (middle column), and 2000+4K
(right column). The bottom row shows the difference (CAMulator - CAM), highlighting deviations between the two
models. The color scale represents temperature (K), with positive/negative values (red/blue) indicating stronger/weaker
values in CAMulator.
In the lower troposphere (Fig. 9b), the integrated heat content exhibits a seasonal amplitude shift relative to CAM6,
which may reflect errors in boundary layer processes or the representation of heat fluxes from the surface. Similarly,
upper-tropospheric heat content (Fig. 9c) shows systematic biases that may be linked to discrepancies in heating
distribution via convective processes or the large-scale advection of heat anomalies.
Overall, the lack of cryosphere representation is a key limitation of CAMulator for extrapolation into warmer climates,
particularly in regions where ice-related feedbacks play a critical role. Future work should assess whether incorporating
explicit representations of land-ice/sea-ice state changes, or at least indirect constraints on polar energy fluxes, could
mitigate these systematic biases and improve the model’s ability to handle out-of-distribution SST forcings.
CAMulator’s ability to replicate large-scale low-level wind patterns under different SST forcing scenarios is evaluated
in Figure 11. The top two rows show the zonal wind component (U) at 850 hPa for CAMulator (Figs. 11a–c) and
CAM6 (Figs. 11d–f) across the +0K, +2K, and +4K SST warming states, while the bottom row (Figs. 11g–i) presents
the difference between CAMulator and CAM6.
Overall, CAMulator demonstrates skill in capturing the large-scale structure of the low-level winds, particularly in
the Southern Ocean. The core features of the midlatitude westerlies, including their equatorward contraction under
warming, are well preserved. The close alignment with CAM6 suggests that CAMulator effectively learns the statistical
relationship between SST forcing and the strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere storm tracks. Given that
Southern Ocean winds are strongly tied to meridional temperature gradients and baroclinic wave activity and that this
relationship is well represented in the training dataset, it is unsurprising that CAMulator generalizes well in this region.
On the other hand, the North Atlantic sector presents a key divergence from CAM6. Despite increasing SSTs, there is
little evidence that the North Atlantic westerlies strengthen in response to warming in CAMulator, whereas CAM6
shows a more pronounced intensification. This discrepancy may reflect limitations in how CAMulator extrapolates
the response of dynamically driven modes such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Since the NAO is strongly
influenced by internal atmospheric variability, rather than a direct SST-driven forcing, its response may be more difficult
for a data-driven model to capture, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Additionally, CAMulator lacks an
explicit representation of transient eddies and their feedbacks on mean flow, which could contribute to weaker NAO-like
variability under warming.
