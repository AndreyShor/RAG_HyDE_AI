FIG. 12. Bayesian network of an agent receiving percepts from a source. This is an edge case of a percept-action loop where
the environment is modeled as a product environment channel.
Lemma 7. Let env be a product environment channel.Then, for any percept-action loop agtM →
←env with a total
distribution pMAS over the variables (M, A, S), that is of the form in eq. (E20), the Bayesian network in Figure 12
is compatible with pMAS.
The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 6.
Proof. By Lemma 5, a distribution over the variables in the Bayesian network shown in Figure 12 fulfills the global
Markov conditions if and only if it factorizes as
pMASZV W = pV0 pZ0
∞
Y
t=0
pMt|Vt pAt|Vt pVt+1|StMt pZt+1|Wt pSt|Wt pWt|Zt.
(E21)
Let pMASZV W be of the form in eq. (E21). Then, in particular those global Markov which involve only variables
Mt, At, and St , t ∈N0, must hold.
Further, Since product environment channels are hidden Markov channels, by Definition 9 for any product environ-
ment channel there must exist a Markov model (Φenv, penv
Z0 ) such that
νenv
S|A(s|a) =
X
z
penv
Z0 (z0)
∞
Y
t=0
ϕenv (st, zt+1|at, zt) .
(E22)
Further, by the definition of product environment channels (Definition 8) we have νenv
S|A(s|a) = νenv
S|A(s|a′) for all
a, a′ ∈MN0.
Thus, for product environment channels, eq. (E22) must still hold if one sets all actions on the
right-hand side in eq. (E22) to some a ∈A. In this case, we obtain
νenv
S|A(s|a) =
X
z
penv
Z0 (z0)
∞
Y
t=0
˜ϕenv (st, zt+1|zt) ,
(E23)
where we defined a new |S × Z| × |Z| transition matrix ˜Φenv with coefficients
˜ϕenv (st, zt+1|zt) = ϕenv (st, zt+1|a, zt) .
