Backward matching.
For backward evolution the PDF matching has to be applied in the
reversed order. In EKO we have implemented two different strategies to perform the inverse
matching: the first one is a numerical inversion, called exact, where the operator matrix
elements of Eqs. (1.101) and (1.102) are inverted exactly in Mellin space; in the second method,
called expanded, the matching matrices are inverted through a perturbative expansion in as in
Mellin space, given by:

with I the identity matrix in flavor space.
As a consistency check we have performed a closure test verifying that after applying two
opposite EKOss to a custom initial condition we are able to recover the initial PDF. Specifically,
the product of the two kernels is an identity both in flavor and momentum space up to the
numerical precision. The results are shown in Fig. 2.4 in case of NNLO evolution crossing the
bottom threshold scale µF = mb. The differences between the two inversion methods are more
visible for singlet-like quantities, because of the non-commutativity of the matching matrix

Special attention must be given to the heavy quark distributions which are always treated
as intrinsic, when performing backward evolution.
In fact, if the initial PDF (above the
mass threshold) contains an intrinsic contribution, this has to be evolved below the threshold
otherwise momentum sum rules can be violated.
This intrinsic component is then scale
independent and fully decoupled from the evolving (light) PDFs. On the other hand, if the
