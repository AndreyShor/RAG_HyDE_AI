Müller-Bravo et al.: SNe Ia NIR Analysis with PCA
Appendix A: Peculiar type Ia Supernovae
The PISCOLA light-curve fits of SNe 2008hs (CfAIR2 sam-
ple) and 2020mbf (DEHVILS sample) are shown in Fig. A.1.
SN 2008hs was originally classified as a normal SN Ia. How-
ever, given its relatively low sBV value (0.623) and much earlier
secondary NIR peak compared to the sample used in this anal-
ysis, this SN could be classified as a ‘transitional’ SN Ia, such
as iPTF13ebh (Hsiao et al. 2015). In the case of SN 2020mbf, it
is very clear that the local NIR minimum is very shallow in all
three bands. It is also of particular interest the J-band light curve,
as the difference in brightness between both peaks (∼0.6 mag)
is much smaller compared to all other SNe Ia in this analysis
(> 1.0 mag: see Fig. 2). This flattening of the light curves is
what defines 06bt-like SNe (Foley et al. 2010), although nor-
mally seen in the i band. However, SN 2006mbf does not have
coverage in this band. A more extended analysis of these objects
is beyond the scope of this work and we encourage their analysis
by the community.
Appendix B: NIR light-curve standardization with
color components
Figures B.1 and B.2 show the corner plot and Hubble diagram,
respectively, using the (Y −H) color-curve PCA coefficients for
the standardization (Sect. 6.5). In this case, the standardization
is favoured by around 3.3σ and 3.7σ significance for p0 and p1,
respectively, while σint is significantly reduced from 0.27 mag
to 0.16 mag. The reader should have in mind that this sample
is smaller than the Y-band only sample given the need of two
bands, which explains the difference in σint.
