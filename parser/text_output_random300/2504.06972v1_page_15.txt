mechanical exfoliation from bulk crystals. Flux-grown 2H-MoTe2 crystals and 
commercial (HQ-graphene) 2H-TaSe2 are used for exfoliation. The stack is made by 
the standard dry transfer method [73] with a polycarbonate stamps inside a nitrogen-
filled glove box. The stacking sequence, from top to bottom, is as follows: graphite as 
the top gate electrode, h-BN (10-15 nm) as the top dielectric layer, few-layer TaSe2 as 
the metallic electrodes, tMoTe2 (in contact with the TaSe2 layer, with the twisted angle 
controlled by a mechanical rotator), h-BN (10-15 nm) as the bottom dielectric layer, 
and graphite as the bottom gate electrode. The entire stack is released onto a Si/SiO2 
substrate, with prepatterned Ti/Pt (3 nm/10 nm) electrodes. The stack is processed into 
a standard Hall bar device using standard e-beam lithography and reactive ion etching 
techniques.  
 
Transport measurements 
Electrical transport measurements were mainly performed in a top-loading dilution 
refrigerator (Oxford TLM) equipped with an 18 T superconducting magnet. The sample 
is immersed in the 3He-4He mixtures during the measurements. The nominal base 
temperature of the 3He-4He mixtures is about 15 mK, and the measurement temperature 
range is limited from 15 mK to 1.5 K. Each fridge line has a sliver epoxy filter and a 
RC- filter (consisting of a 470 Ω resistor and a 100-pF capacitor) at low temperature. 
The base electron temperature for Van der Waals devices is roughly estimated to be 
around 100 mK, based on prior experience with measuring superconductivity in Bernal 
bilayer graphene [43]. We performed the electrical transport measurements by using the 
standard low-frequency lock-in techniques. The bias current is limited within 1 nA to 
avoid sample heating and disturbance of fragile quantum states. We convert the 
measured longitudinal resistance Rxx into longitudinal resistivity ρxx by 𝜌𝜌𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥= 𝑅𝑅𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥

where W is the Hall bar width and L is the separation between voltage probes. The Hall 
resistivity ρxy equals to measured Hall resistance Rxy in two-dimensional case.
