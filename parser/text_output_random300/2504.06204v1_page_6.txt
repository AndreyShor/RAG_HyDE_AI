ing to the cases of spin I = 3/2 and I = 7/2, respectively.
During the initial stages of evolution (k = 1, 11, . . . , 51),
the spin-7/2 system exhibits stronger quantum coher-
ence, as shown in Figs.2(d) and (b), although this co-
herence fast dissipates. In contrast, the spin-3/2 system,
while displaying weaker coherence amplitude, maintains
the coherence for a longer period, persisting until approx-
imately k = 91. This behavior is closely related to the
spectral density parameter J0 (see Table I). This param-
eter influences the relaxation dynamics, particularly for
zero- and high-order coherences. In the cesium nuclei,
J0 is significantly higher one order of magnitude greater
than in the sodium nuclei, which causes faster decoher-
ence in the spin-7/2 system.

UPPER BOUND AT THE THERMAL
EQUILIBRIUM OF THE SYSTEM
At thermal equilibrium, the density matrix ρeq is well
defined and described by Eq.(16). In this context, we can
predict an upper bound for the squeezing parameter ξ2
eq.
Under the same conditions, the angle αeq, which charac-
terizes the geometric orientation of the squeezing, is zero.
Consequently, the product of variances (∆Ip·∆Im)eq and
(∆Iy · ∆Iz)eq becomes equivalent. An equation for both
quantities can be established using the inductive method,
a mathematical approach that begins with specific exam-
ples and extends to general conclusions. This method is
based on the principle that if a statement holds for a spe-
cific case and remains valid for a sufficiently large number
of similar cases, it can be considered true for all cases.
In that sense, this method allows us to find an equiva-
lence between the squeezing parameter and the product
of variances, expressed by the equations below

under the same conditions. The red and blue lines indicate
the best fit to the data.
Fig.(5) illustrates the dependence due to the spin quan-
tum number values for the squeezing parameter or the
variance product in the thermal equilibrium regime. In
Fig.5(a), the red dots represent the values of the squeez-
ing parameter for different spin quantum numbers, while
Fig.5(b) shows the corresponding product of variances
(blue dots). The red and blue lines denote the best lin-
ear fits to each dataset. These results offer valuable in-
sights with respect to the evolution of spin squeezing and
uncertainty in quadrupolar spin systems, which allows
analytical predictions.
For the specific cases presented in Figs.1(c)-(e), the
upper bound at thermal equilibrium is 1.67 and 3.0 for
the squeezing parameter. Similarly, in Figs.2(c)-(d), the
upper bound for the product of variances reaches 0.84
and 4.0, respectively.
In all cases, these values are in
agreement with the constraint given by Eq.(27).

CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we investigate the decoherence of spin
squeezed states in NMR quadrupolar systems with spin
quantum numbers I = 3/2 and I = 7/2, incorporat-
ing relaxation effects.
The spin squeezing arises from
the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole moment
and the local electric field gradients. By employing the
