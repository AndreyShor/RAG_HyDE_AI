suﬃciently large intervals (whose precise size depends on the structure constants for X and Y
respectively) with I << J (again the precise requirements depend on the constants from weak
algebraic Haag duality). Then {ξi ⊠A ηj} forms a projective basis for X ⊠A Y , and the braiding
is given by
βX,Y (ξi ⊠A νj) = νj ⊠A ξi ∈Y ⊠A X.
This indeed gives a well-deﬁned intertwiner of correspondences, does not depend on the choice of
bases, and satisﬁes the hexagon equation that characterizes a braiding on a monoidal category.
2.2. Charge transporters. In this section, we introduce an analogue of the notion of ‘charge
transporter’ [M¨ug99] from algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory. We note that charge transporters are
essentially formalizations of “patch operators” used in topological holography [IW23, CW23].
Fix a DHR bimodule X over A•. Suppose that F1, F2 are ﬁnite subsets of Z, such that we have
bases (ξk
i )i localized in Fk for k = 1, 2. We then put
tij = ⟨ξ1
i |ξ2
j ⟩∈A.
We thus have

the bases localized in F1 and F2 respectively.
Proposition 2.7. Consider the matrix P1 = [p(1)

ij

then have TT ∗= P1 and P1T = T, that is,

Proof. This follows from

and (2.1).

A similar computation demonstrates the following.
Proposition 2.8. Consider the matrix P2 ∈Mn2(A) given by P2 = [p(2)

p(2)

Let X and Y be DHR bimodules over A•. Let us recall some facts about the braiding
βX,Y : X ⊠A Y →Y ⊠A X.
Choose ﬁnite subsets F1 < F3 < F2 of Z, where < refers to the order on Z rather than
containment, such that X has bases (ξ1
i )i and (ξ2
j )j localized in F1 and F2 respectively, and
Y has a basis (ηk)k localized in F3. Then by the independence of basis choice in deﬁning the
braiding, we can express βX,Y and βY,X as A-linear extensions of the maps deﬁned on bases by
βX,Y (ξ1
i ⊠ηk) = ηk ⊠ξ1
i ,
βY,X(ηk ⊠ξ2
