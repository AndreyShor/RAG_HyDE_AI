In this work, we demonstrate gate-tunable hot-electron extraction, as well as a 
rigorous method of obtaining both transferred electron density and lattice temperature 
increment, which demonstrate a doping-assisted mechanism in harvesting excess 
energy of hot carriers in TMD materials. Although the current hot-electron extraction 
efficiency is only a few percent, it can be further enhanced by reducing the thickness of 
inset hBN (e.g., the tunneling probability of 1L hBN is about one order larger than that 
of 3L hBN33), using a multilayer MoSe2 with indirect band gap12,13,34 that can reduce 
radiative recombination losses, and aligning the crystal orientation of both TMDs layers 
for minimizing momentum mismatch.
