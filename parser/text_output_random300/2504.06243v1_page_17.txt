d = 3, see Fig. 4. RG flow, moving from the UV into the IR, runs in the direction opposite to the
arrows. Starting with both λ1, λ2 being positive, we see that the couplings flow to zero, similar
to the case of one positive coupling in the previous section. On the other hand, starting with one
positive and one negative coupling, and following the flow both forwards and backwards, shows
that the magnitude of one of the couplings becomes large in both the deep UV and deep IR. In
other words, we lose perturbative control. Unlike what occurred in the single coupling case (2.17),
the background state nk is valid neither at very small k nor very large k; it is only valid in the
vicinity of the starting scale µ0.
4. Nearly marginal interactions
Here we turn to interactions that are nearly marginal: the dimension of the interaction (3.7)
is taken to be D = −ϵ, with ϵ ≪1. The previous calculations of the one-loop beta function are
modified in a simple way, picking up an extra factor of µ−ϵ. Concretely, for couplings of the form
λ1234(µ) = λ(µ)(p2

Likewise, the beta function (3.22) is replaced by,

where we defined κ for notional simplicity. Defining a dimensionless coupling g(µ) = λ(µ)µ−ϵ puts
the beta function in the more familiar form,
µdg
dµ = −ϵg + κg2 .
(4.3)
Subsequently integrating the coupling yields,
λ(µ) =

(4.4)
We see that λ is given by λ(µ0) at µ = µ0, whereas as µ →0 the coupling behaves as,
λ(µ →0) →ϵ
κµϵ .
(4.5)
The interaction starts off scale-invariant, with scaling exponent β at scale µ0. It is then scale-
dependent at intermediate scales, and becomes scale-invariant again in the IR, now with scaling
