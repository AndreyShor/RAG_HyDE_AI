On account of (3.18), it holds νN([δ, 1]) < 2(N + 1)e−(Nδ+1)2/6(N+1). It follows that there exists N suffi-
ciently large, such that (II) can be made smaller than ε.
For (I), we first exploit the triangle inequality: for all N ∈N+, J ∈JN and Ω∈S2, it holds

(3.20)
If we now apply the supremum over J ∈JN, for which 0 ≤2J
N < δ and the supremum over Ω∈S2, then, for
N large enough, the first summand in (3.20) is bounded by ε on account of (3.14). The second summand
is bounded by ε due to uniform continuity of P ◦hCW
0
, cf. (3.19), which is applied at the zero vector, i.e.,
at the point 0 · e(Ω)) = 0, for which it holds hCW
0
(0 · e(Ω)) = 0.
This shows the validity of (3.7), thereby concluding the proof of the theorem.
Remark 1. We note that the previous result readily generalizes to any (normalized) mean-field quantum
spin model expressed as a polynomial in the total spin operator. This follows from [21, Proposition II.2],
which states that the continuous functional calculus of a (normalized) mean-field model, representing a so-
called quasi-symmetric sequence, remains quasi-symmetric. A detailed exploration of this generalization is
left for future work.

Restricted Curie-Weiss model
Through direct inspection, the Curie-Weiss model HCW
N
preserves the symmetric subspace SymN(C2),
which has dimension N + 1. Consequently, the model can be restricted this subspace. With a slight abuse
