This peculiar behavior, ﬁrst observed in [103,104], is due to a subtle interplay between
the gravitational attraction and relativistic motion of the particles in a space–time with
cosmic attraction. It is demonstrative of the unexpected relativistic behaviour that self-
gravitating systems can exhibit.

There is a second extremum in each half-period for m = 0.05m0.

The motion becomes unbound for masses m < 4.73m0.
If Λe > 0, R > 0 in the absence of stress–energy, and a de Sitter-like cosmic expansion
ensues. The situation for various values of m is illustrated in Figure 5. For a large enough
m, the motion is bounded. As m decreases, the period of the motion becomes larger, until at
a critical value of m ≲4.729, the period becomes inﬁnite. Here, the cosmic expansion
balances the gravitational attraction of the particles, and dominates for smaller values of
m. The bound behaviour is fully analogous to that of an overdense universe that expands
to some maximal value of the scale factor and then recontracts; the unbound behaviour is
