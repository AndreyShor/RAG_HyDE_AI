Abstract
Accurate Standard Model predictions of proton-proton collisions are essential
for interpreting the current and forthcoming experimental measurements
from high-energy colliders. The quest for physics beyond the Standard Model
is in fact strongly related to a reliable determination of systematic uncertain-
ties, among which the theoretical ones have nowadays become a significant
component. In particular, an important role is played by the universal Parton
Distribution Functions (PDFs). This thesis presents a collection of studies
aimed at improving the accuracy and precision of collinear PDF determina-
tions. By employing the NNPDF methodology, we present recent polarized
and unpolarized PDF fits including higher order QCD corrections and theoret-
ical uncertainties. Additionally, we examine the presence of non-vanishing
intrinsic charm and its phenomenological implications.
