where M is the number of MS(θ) gates applied, A is a
fit parameter that allows for a finite SPAM offset, and
Mσ,odd is the Gaussian standard deviation representing
leakage rate into the odd-parity subspace.
With this, we can model the dephasing of the Rabi
oscillation within the even-parity subspace with an addi-
tional Gaussian decay envelope:

where Mσ,even is the standard deviation of the Gaus-
sian decay envelope.
We first fit the measured values of Podd according to
Eq. 7, then fit P|11⟩to Eq. 8. For θ = π
2 , π
8 , and π
32 we find
Mσ,odd = 83(3), 157(4), and 179(2) gates and Mσ,even =
12.9(5), 19.8(8), and 48 (1) gates, respectively.
We note that these decay envelopes do not fully repli-
cate the actual behavior of the system.
In particular
at high numbers of repeated gates, the Gaussian decay
overestimates the decay of the even parity states. Like-
wise, there is no clear relation between the odd decay
profile and the even decay profiles. This suggests this
phenomenological model is not fully representative of all
of the potential limiters: decoherence, dephasing, ampli-
tude fluctuations, heating, and axial motion. Regardless,
there is a trend for increasing coherence with decreasing
θ.

LIGHT SHIFTS AND FRAME ROTATIONS
Due to the significant laser powers required to achieve
these MS(θ) gates, it is imperative that we are cognizant
of the light shifts that result. Light shifts induce addi-
tional energy splittings on the qubit levels as a result
of the Autler-Townes, or AC Stark, effect. In particu-
lar, these additional energy splittings on the qubit levels
will affect the precession of the qubit relative to the bare
rotating frame leading to phase errors in the gate if un-
compensated. In this section, we discuss the sources of
our light shifts during the MS(θ) gate and our methods
for cancellation.

A.
Origin of Light Shifts
The typical, second-order, light shift is largely min-
imized by our choice of wavelength for the Raman
laser [30].
However, we use a frequency comb to gen-
erate Raman transitions, and thus a significant con-
tribution from fourth-order light shifts remains [31].
These fourth-order light shifts may be understood as de-
tuned two-photon Raman coupling. This coupling occurs
both between the usual qubit states (|F = 0, mF = 0⟩
and |F = 1, mF = 0⟩) and due to state coupling from
|F = 0, mF = 0⟩to the |F = 1, mF = ±1⟩Zeeman sub-
levels in the 2S1/2 hyperfine manifold.
The dominant
contribution to fourth-order light shifts during the MS
gate in our system is from the detuned two-photon drive
of the qubit carrier transition, and thus, we will only
consider these here. As the effective Raman Rabi rate is
approximately Ωeff ≈2π × 125 kHz and the radial mo-
tional mode frequencies range from 2 to 2.5 MHz, fourth-
order shifts of |Ω2
eff/4δ| ≈2π × 2 kHz are expected from
the rf tones driving the red and blue sideband.
