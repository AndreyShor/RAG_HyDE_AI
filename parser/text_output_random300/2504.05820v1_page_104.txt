basis display larger PDF uncertainties, possibly because the flavor basis has not undergone the
same extensive hyperoptimization as the fits in the evolution basis.
Dependence on the value of the charm mass.
We verify the independence of our results
on the value of the charm quark mass, by repeating our determination as the (pole) charm
mass is varied from the default mc = 1.51 GeV to mc = 1.38 GeV and 1.64 GeV. Note that we
always choose the scale µc = mc as matching scale between the 4FNS and 3FNS, hence this is
also varied alongside mc. The total and valence charm PDFs xc± at Q = 1.65 GeV in the 4FNS
are displayed in Fig. 3.18. The result is found to be essentially independent of the charm mass
value, in agreement with the corresponding result of Section 3.1.3 (Fig. 3.4).
Dataset dependence.
We study the effect of removing some datasets from our determination,
with the dual goal of checking the stability of our results, and investigating which data mostly
determine the valence charm PDF. Specifically, we remove the LHCb W, Z data, which was
found in Section 3.1.3 to dominate the constraints on the total charm PDF from all collider
