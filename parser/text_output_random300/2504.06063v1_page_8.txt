Note that, in contrast to the total rate Γ, the first
two lepton-energy moments do probe the parity-breaking
form factor h(5) = Y(5)/|ω|.

are the Laplace transforms of the spectral densities de-

The procedure that we used to extract these quantities
from lattice correlators is discussed in section VI. Before
doing that, however, we derive in the next section the
asymptotic formulae that we use to study numerically the
σ 7→0 extrapolations. These formulae will also motivate
our choice of organizing the calculation in terms of the
spectral densities Z(p)(ω0, ω2) and Z(p)
l
(ω0, ω2) and not
in terms of the Y(i)(ω0, ω2).

THE σ 7→0 ASYMPTOPTIC BEHAVIOUR
In the previous two sections, in order to compute the to-
tal rate and the lepton-energy moments on the lattice, we
traded the compact ω0 phase-space integral for convolu-
tions of the Z(p)(ω0, ω2) and Z(p)
l
(ω0, ω2) distributions
with the smooth kernels Θ(p)
σ (ωmax −ω0) and with the
σ 7→0 limiting procedure. In order to understand how to
perform numerically the required σ 7→0 extrapolations
we now study the asymptotic behavior for small values
of σ of the generic expression
G(p)(σ) =
Z ∞
ωmin−ε
dω0 Θ(p)
σ (ωmax −ω0) Z(ω0)
(51)
in
which
G(p)(σ)
can
be
either
dΓ(p)(σ)/dω2
or
dM (p)
l
(σ)/dω2 and, correspondingly, Z(ω0) can be ei-
ther Z(p)(ω0, ω2) or Z(p)
l
(ω0, ω2) (see Eqs. (33), (41),
and (45)).
As we are now going to explain, the behavior of G(p)(σ)
for small values of σ is governed by the behavior of
the distribution Z(ω0) for ω0 in a neighborhood of
ωmax.
