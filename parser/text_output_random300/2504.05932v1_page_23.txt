Figure 2: The resummations including more and more non-perturbative (“NP”) corrections
(dashed lines) approximate the high precision numerical value of the TBA (solid black line)
increasingly better, than using only the perturbative part (“PT”). The solid red line shows the
asymptotic series (“asy.”) of the perturbative part ϵ(0)(g) truncated at the g7 term. The Borel
integrals were performed at the specific g values corresponding to b = 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4
(see the dots on the dashed lines).
which was also defined in eq. (12) of [31]. We define the transmonomials ϵ(k)(g) as
ϵ(g) = ϵ(0)(g) + ϵ(1)(g)e−4/g + ϵ(2)(g)e−8/g + ϵ(3)(g)e−12/g + O

for which we can compute the asymptotic series of each. With the Borel–Pad´e method, we
resummed the explicitly shown non-perturbative orders in (110) at a few g values and plotted
the result against a high-precision TBA numerical computation. The latter was obtained for
several b values in the range 0.05 ≤b ≤200 with the method mentioned in Subsubsection 7.2.1,
to get a clear picture on the behaviour of the normalized moment ϵ(g). In Figure 2, as we include
more non-perturbative corrections, the trans-series approximation gets closer and closer to the
physical result.
To further demonstrate our analysis for higher moments ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . , ϕ5, and validate our
trans-series solution with greater confidence, we compare the resummations of several exponen-
tial corrections to the TBA value of these moments at a single value of the coupling. We use
the value g ≃0.082485, which corresponds to b = 10. In this case e−4/g ≃8.7 × 10−22 and
thus we expect the exponential corrections to give only slight improvements on the value of
the quantities.11 Typically, for each exponential order that we include, the difference to the
physical result is of the order of the next exponential correction, except for the O(e−4/g) term,
whose coefficients in the asymptotic expansion are purely imaginary, and thus only give real
contributions after resummation at higher exponential orders.
At the given value b = 10, the estimated relative error for the moments using the numerical
TBA result12 was of the order of 10−352. According to numerical studies in [21], the error of
the trans-series resummation is dominated by the lateral Borel integration of the perturbative
part, and we estimated it (simply comparing resummations from 336 and 334 coefficients) to be
of the order of 10−101.
11The reason behind that the magnitude of the consecutive exponential corrections in Table 2 are not really
on the order of the powers of this numerical value of e−4/g is the fact that each exponential correction in the
trans-series typically starts with a high inverse power of g, and thus the values of these asymptotic series (even
after resummation) is quite large at this small g coupling.
12The Chebyshev basis of method [31] was truncated at the 1400th polynomial.
