With the derived density matrix ρb, one can simply cal-
culated the concurrence C with the auxiliary matrix (4)
and reveal the degree of the spin entanglement between
the created electron-positron pair. The energy (lightfront
momentum fraction) and transverse-momentum depen-
dence of the final density matrix ρb(s) and ρb(rx, ry)
can also be acquired by removing the corresponding
pre-integrals in (11) and normalizing respectively with
dPb/ds and d2Pb/drxdry.
One can thus measure the
spin entanglement between the produced pair with dif-
ferent energy in the specified direction by calculating the
concurrence C(s) and C(rx, ry).

Local approximation
For the NBW process to proceed we of course need
to reach the kinematic threshold to produce the (mas-
sive) electron-positron pair from the (massless) initial
photon. For laser-particle collisions, where this thresh-
old is reached through the absorption of many photons,
we quantify strength of the interaction using the strong-
field parameter χ which must reach χ ≳O(1). Some-
times referred to as the ‘quantum nonlinearity param-
eter’ (because χ ∝ℏ), in a plane-wave electromagnetic
background, it takes the simple form χ = ξη.
Laser-
particle experiments can typically reach η ∼O(0.1) and
therefore we require ξ ≫1 for NBW to be observable.
In this nonlinear regime, direct calculation using Volkov
states is cumbersome and approximate ‘local’ rates are
instead derived and employed in numerical simulation of
experimental set-ups.
These local rates are inferred by rewriting the double
phase integral in Eq.
(10) as an integral over the av-
erage phase φ = (ϕ1 + ϕ2)/2 and the interference phase
ϑ = ϕ2−ϕ1. Formally, the limits on the integration in the
interference phase are infinite but in many cases a useful
approximation can be made by replacing the integration
limits with ±∆ϑ/2. The (phase) region ∆ϑ that must be
included for an accurate approximation is often referred
to as the formation length of the process (for more details,
see e.g. [32]). The exponent and pre-exponent in the dou-
ble phase integral in Eq. (10) are then expanded indepen-
dently in ϑ and, which is then integrated over the orig-
inal limits. In this, two main expansion approaches are
used. The locally constant field approximation (LCFA)
is used when ξ ≫1 since in this limit, the formation
length scales as ∆ϑ ∼1/ξ [66] and hence includes in-
terference effects only on the sub-wavelength scale. The
LCFA corresponds to integrating the ‘probability rate’
for the process occurring in a constant and crossed back-
ground, over the local value of the intensity parameter
of a non-constant field [73–79]. The range of application
of the LCFA has been broadly studied [80, 81], and ef-
forts have been made to improve its precision [82–85].
A second approach, the locally monochromatic approxi-
mation (LMA) results in a probability equal to that in
a monochromatic background, but with the (constant)
amplitude of the potential replaced by the local value of
the pulse envelope and the (infinite) phase length factor
again replaced by an integral over phase [86–89]. The
LMA is less versatile than the LCFA, requiring a laser
pulse with a well-defined frequency i.e., f ′(ϕ) ≪1, but
it is valid to much lower values of the intensity and cap-
tures harmonic structures in outgoing particle spectra
because it includes interference on formation length sales
of the order of the wavelength ∆ϑ ∼O(λ). (The LMA
and LCFA both ignore effects that arise due to intensity
gradients in the envelope, but these are generally only
important for very short pulses.) The LMA was used to
model the production of NBW pairs in the E144 exper-
iment [90] and is central to modelling the NBW process
in the proposed LUXE laser-particle experiment [51, 54]
using the simulation code Ptarmigan [91, 92]. Because of
the importance of particle polarisation to entanglement
and the fact that the LCFA is sometimes deficient, in
describing polarisation effects (e.g. the circular polarisa-
