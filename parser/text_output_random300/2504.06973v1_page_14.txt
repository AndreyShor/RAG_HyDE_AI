Fig. 13: Evolution of the stripped donor star of HIP 15429 in the
HRD. The model track (black line) was computed for a binary
system with initial masses of 5.5 M⊙and 4.95 M⊙and an orbital
period of 8 days. The black square marker indicates the present-
day values of the stripped star, estimated from spectroscopy (ef-
fective temperature) and SED fitting (luminosity). Coloured sec-
tions mark critical evolutionary episodes. Orange markers are
spaced in regular time intervals of 5 × 104 years starting at the
time of first Roche-lobe overflow.
Fig. 13 illustrates the evolution of the stripped star for a
model with initial donor mass of 5.5 M⊙(model M3 in Ta-
ble G.1). The main sequence evolution of the donor star closely
follows the evolution of a single star. After core-hydrogen deple-
tion, hydrogen shell burning begins, the core contracts, the outer
layers expand, and the star moves to cooler effective tempera-
tures in the HRD. The expansion continues until the star fills its
Roche lobe, initiating a phase of stable Case B mass transfer to
its companion. This mass transfer episode lasts approximately
0.37 Myr. The donor star loses > 4 M⊙of its hydrogen-rich en-
velope, reducing its mass to 0.99 M⊙and leaving an envelope
mass of approximately 0.14 M⊙. Here, envelope refers to the
layers above the core-envelope boundary, which we define as
the mass coordinate where the hydrogen abundance drops below
XH = 0.1, following Kruckow et al. (2016).
After mass transfer ends, the donor star contracts and evolves
towards higher effective temperatures to become a compact he-
lium star. During this transition phase, referred to as the bloated
stripped star phase in the recent literature, the donor resembles
a regular supergiant in the HRD but is actually much less mas-
sive. Following Dutta & Klencki (2023) and defining the bloated
stripped star phase as the time between the end of the Roche-
lobe overflow and the time when the stripped donor becomes
hotter than its ZAMS position plus 0.1 dex in log Teff, the bloated
stripped star phase of the donor lasts for ≈0.27 Myr; corre-
sponding to less than 1% of the main sequence lifetime. The star
continues to contract and heat up before settling as a core he-
lium burning hot subdwarf star with Teff ≈44 kK, log g ≈5.2 .
We modelled its evolution up to the point of core-helium de-
pletion, after which the stripped star will evolve into a white
dwarf. This transition is expected to occur before the Be star
completes its main-sequence evolution. However, for our mod-
els with initial mass ratios close to unity (qinitial ≲1.1) and highly
non-conservative mass transfer (β ≳0.7), e.g., model M3d, the
Be star completed its main-sequence evolution first. Although
the subsequent evolution of the system has not been computed,
it might then undergo a phase of inverse (and likely unstable)

Fig. 14: Evolutionary models for the stripped donor star with
varying initial masses. The panels show the model tracks on a
Kiel diagram (top) and in the HRD (bottom). The model tracks
are plotted for a range of initial masses between 4 and 7 M⊙
(models M1 - M5 in Table G.1), which yields stripped star
masses of 0.7 ≤Md,stripped / M⊙≤1.4 as indicated in the leg-
end. The present-day values of HIP 15429, inferred from spec-
tral analysis and SED fitting, are plotted as black squares.
mass transfer. A common envelope phase could ultimately lead
to the formation of a close double white dwarf binary or a merger
event.
In Fig. 14, we show a Kiel diagram of stripped star models
with masses between 0.71 and 1.39 M⊙alongside the observa-
tionally determined parameters of the HIP 15429 stripped star.
The models were produced from calculations with initial donor
masses of 4.0, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 and 7.0 M⊙. In the set of simula-
tions, there is a monotonic relationship between initial donor
mass and final stripped star mass. But note that this is not nec-
essarily the case since the mapping between initial mass and
stripped star mass and radius also depends sensitively on the
assumed subgrid mixing during the main sequence (e.g., over-
shooting and semi-convection). Based on the surface gravity and
effective temperature (Fig. 14, upper panel) no tight constraints
on the stripped star mass are possible and the measured values
for the stripped star in HIP 15429 are consistent with a broad
range of (initial) masses. We find, however, that the luminosity of
the stripped star is best reproduced with a model of initial mass
5.5 M⊙and stripped star mass 0.99 M⊙, see Fig. 14 in the lower
panel. This value is higher than the inferred spectroscopic mass
MB,spec = 0.69+0.63
−0.31 M⊙but is consistent within the uncertainties.
