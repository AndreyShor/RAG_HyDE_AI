various voltages (4, 12, and 8 Vrms from left to right at 500 Hz). b, Finite element simulation (via 
Python) of the electric field distribution of the corresponding samples. c, Photograph of multi-
stiffness organo-gel obtained after AC voltage application. d, Storage modulus of electric field-
induced thiol-ene organo-gel as a function of distance.
