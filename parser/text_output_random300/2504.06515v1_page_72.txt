Figure 55. An example of how a regular motion (upper left) can become chaotic (lower left) from
a small change in initial conditions, with corresponding particle trajectories shown at the right. In
all ﬁgures, FE conditions are used with H/Mtot = 0.625, and initially (pρ, pβ, pα) = (0, 0, 0), and
(β, α) = (1.633, 0.70711). In the upper two ﬁgures ρ = 0.70711, initially, but in the lower two ﬁgures
ρ = 0.70712 initially. The small box in each of the left ﬁgures marks the initial position of the box
particle. The upper ﬁgures show regular motion, but the lower ones show a rapid onset of chaos.
7.4. Poincaré Plots
The most natural extension of a Poincaré plot to the 4-body case is the use of spherical
coordinates, plotting the radial momentum pR against the squares of the two angular
momenta p2
θ and p2
ϕ. Writing
sin ϕ
=
β
p
ρ2 + β2 ,
cos ϕ =
ρ
p
ρ2 + β2
(206)
sin θ
=
p
ρ2 + β2
p
ρ2 + β2 + α2 ,
cos θ =
α
p
ρ2 + β2 + α2
R is the distance from the origin to the point of crossing in (ρ, β, α) space and (θ, ϕ) are the
polar and azimuthal angles of this point. The unit vectors for these spherical coordinates
are
ˆR =


cos ϕ sin θ
sin ϕ sin θ
cos θ

,
ˆϕ =


−sin ϕ
cos ϕ


,
ˆθ =


cos ϕ cos θ
