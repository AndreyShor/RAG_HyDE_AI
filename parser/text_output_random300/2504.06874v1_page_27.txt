Supplementary Figure 4. 
Fig. S8. Raman spectra of device 1. a, Optical image of the tetralayer graphene. The 
white box marks the scanning area of (b). b, SNOM image of the same tetralayer 
graphene shown inside the white box in (a), containing regions with different optical 
near-field contrast at Vg = 0 V. They correspond to distinct domains with ABAB, ABCA, 
and ABCB-type stacking orders, indicated by black, blue and red dots. The scanning 
area of Figs. 2a-2h in the main text coincides with the area enclosed by the yellow 
dashed frame. It also marks the scanning area of KPFM data shown in Fig. S6 below. 
c, Raman spectra obtained from the three different stackings whose measurement points 
are marked in (b). Note that the small area of polar domains (at the center of the yellow 
dashed frame in (b)) makes direct far-field Raman measurements challenging. We 
instead measure the Raman spectra of the nearby polar domain that shows identical 
optical near-field response (red dots in (b) with an identified ABCB stacking order). 
Raman spectra collected from three distinct stackings exhibit noticeable differences, 
being consistent with the results shown in the main text (Figs. 1i) and with previous 
reports [1-4]. The scale bar in (b) is 2 Âµm.
