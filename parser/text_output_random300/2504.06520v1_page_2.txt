materials, loss mechanisms cause frequency-dependent variations in wave speed, a 
phenomenon known as dispersion [21,22]. The dispersion curves and viscoelastic properties of 
biological tissues have been examined in various studies, including the dispersion curve of 
porcine cornea [23-25], viscoelastic characterization of porcine cornea [26], and shear viscosity 
of chicken liver [27]. Additionally, Poul et al. [28] demonstrated that the viscoelastic behavior 
of bovine liver tissue can be modeled using a two-parameter power-law model for shear wave 
speed (SWS) dispersion. 
Reverberant shear wave fields provide a novel framework for enhancing the 
characterization of tissue biomechanics in elastography [29-31]. These fields arise from the 
superposition of shear waves propagating in multiple directions, including reflections from 
tissue boundaries and internal heterogeneities. Recent advancements have highlighted the 
potential of this method for probing complex biological tissues, where conventional single-
point techniques may fail to capture the full mechanical behavior [32-34]. 
To accurately analyze the viscoelastic and lossy nature of the biological tissues using shear 
wave elastography, it is essential to estimate SWS across multiple frequencies [35,36]. 
However, several shear wave OCE methods rely on a single excitation frequency, limiting their 
ability to fully capture complex tissue mechanics, particularly the dispersive viscoelastic 
properties. Other impulsive excitation methods can be used to impart a band of frequencies 
within a propagating transient wave [10]; however these decay rapidly with distance away from 
the source location. 
To address this limitation, we introduce a novel OCE approach based on multi-frequency 
reverberant shear waves (MFR-OCE). The advantages of this approach include robust shear 
wave propagations within a 3D volume and simultaneously across a discrete set of frequencies 
covering a wide bandwidth. This paper presents the theoretical framework, simulations, 
experimental setup, and preliminary results of MFR-OCE on gelatin phantoms, porcine cornea, 
and bovine liver, demonstrating its potential to enhance both elastic and viscoelastic tissue 
characterization for clinical applications. 
2. Mathematical concepts 
The particle velocity within a fully reverberant shear wave field is mathematically represented 
as [37] 
𝑽(𝜺, 𝑡) = ∑𝒏̂𝑞𝑙 𝑣𝑞𝑙 𝑒𝑖(𝑘𝒏̂𝑞.𝜺−𝜔0𝑡 )
𝑞,𝑙
, 
 (1) 
where 𝒏̂𝑞 represents the direction of wave propagation, with the index 𝑞 denoting a specific 
instance of the random unit vector 𝒏̂𝑞. The vector 𝒏̂𝑞𝑙 indicates the direction of particle velocity 
for that instance of 𝑞, and the index 𝑙 identifies a particular instance of the random unit vector 
𝒏̂𝑞𝑙.  𝑣𝑞𝑙 is an independent, identically distributed random variable representing the magnitude 
of particle velocity for that instance of 𝑞. In the context of the shear wave propagation, 𝑛̂𝑞 and 
𝑛̂𝑞𝑙 are perpendicular, resulting in 𝑛̂𝑞⋅𝑛̂𝑞𝑙= 0 . In this expression, 𝑘 represents the 
wavenumber, 𝜔0 denotes angular frequency, 𝜺 is the position vector, and 𝑡 is time. 
In OCE, the particle velocity is typically measured along the laser axis, which is 
perpendicular to the sample surface. Assuming the sensor axis aligns with the z-axis, the 
recorded particle velocity can be expressed as 𝑉𝑧(𝜺, 𝑡) = 𝑽(𝜺, 𝑡) ⋅𝑒̂𝑧, where 𝑒̂𝑧 is a unit vector 
in the z-direction. For the reverberant field 𝑉𝑧(𝜺, 𝑡0), closed-form complex analytical solutions 
can be derived using spatial autocorrelation in the spherical coordinate system as detailed by 
Aleman-Castañeda et al. [38] as
