FIG. 4: Graph of Fidelity Calculation Results in a 1D Kitaev Chain of single qubit. (a) illustrates the distribution
of quantum gate fidelity in a one-dimensional Kitaev superconducting chain under variations of dµ and d∆. When
dµ is fixed, the fidelity decreases as d∆increases; conversely, when the d∆is fixed, increasing dµ leads to higher
fidelity. Notably, the maximum fidelity of the system exceeds 0.99994. (b) showed that under fixed parameters
(dµ = 0.5,d∆= 0.5)the fidelity initially oscillates over time, then gradually stabilizes, and ultimately stabilizes near
0.9999.
FIG. 5: Graph of Fidelity Calculation Results in a 2D Ising model of single qubit. (a) showed that the fidelity of the
system exhibits a discrete diagonal distribution at its maximum value, the maximum fidelity of the system exceeds
0.99999. (b) showed that fidelity curve as a function of time fitted using B´ezier Curves under fixed parameters
