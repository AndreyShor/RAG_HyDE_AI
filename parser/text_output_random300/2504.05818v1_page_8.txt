where mi is the mass of the constituent (anti-)quark i, ωg is the energy of constituent gluon, P ≡PB = −PC is the
momentum of meson B in the center of mass system of hybrid A, q is the relative momentum between the created
quark-antiquark pair, and k is the relative momentum between constituent gluon and q¯q cluster in hybrid.

Chiral constituent quark model
When describing the interaction between q¯q, the chi-
ral quark model has become one of the most effective
approaches to describe hadron spectra, hadron-hadron
interactions and multiquark states. The general form of
multi-body Hamiltonian in the model is given as
H =

mi + pi2



+

X
j>i=1
[VCON(rij) + VOGE(rij) + VGBE(rij)] ,
(41)
where mi is the constituent mass (quark, antiquark, or
gluon), pi is momentum of costituents, and TCM is the
kinetic energy of the center-of mass.
Due to the fact that a nearly massless current light
quark acquires a dynamical, momentum dependent mass
(so-called constituent quark mass) for its interaction with
the gluon medium, ChQM contains color confinement po-
tential, one-gluon exchange potential (OGE) and Gold-
stone boson exchange potentials (GBE). These three po-
tentials reveal the most relevant features of QCD at low
energy regime, i.e., confinement, asymptotic freedom and
chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking.
Enough work in the past has done a good job inves-
tigating the states discovered experimentally, especially
the multiquark candidates.
Therefore, the interaction
potentials between quarks and anti-quarks will adopt the
form in previous work [1–3]. For color confinement po-
tential, we consider central and spin-orbit contributions,
if taking the screened form as an example, they can be
