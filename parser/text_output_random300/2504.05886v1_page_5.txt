FIG. 3.
Phase behaviour of the system, as a function of λ and pω. The shading shows the total particle density at each
point in the control parameter space. Snapshots I-IV show the coexistence-fixation transition. Snapshots IV-VII show the
coexistence-extinction transition. System size is L = 300, results are based on simulations of T = 105 MCS. Blue dotted and
dash-dotted lines are curves of constant ω = 0.01 and ω = 0.1 respectively, see the text for a discussion (Sec. III B).
sites are counted in both triangles.) We also define three
other pure strategies: clustering (C) where the preferred
direction has the maximal number of peers; evasion of
predators (E), where the preferred direction has the min-
imal number of predators; and spreading (S), where the
preferred direction has the maximal number of empty
site). We define mixed strategies by combining two pure
ones. For example, the “evasion & hunting” (E&H) strat-
egy assigns D∗
1 according to the evasion strategy and D∗
2
according to the hunting strategy.
The effectiveness of these strategies depends weakly on
the perception range R (see App. C) so we fix the per-
ception range R = 3 throughout the main text.
We
emphasize again that for this work, the only species
to have environmentally-dependent probabilities P(D)
is the smart species A; the other species B, C always
choose their directions uniformly at random, as described
in Sec. II B.

PHASE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MODEL
(SYMMETRIC CASE)
In this section, we describe the phase behaviour of the
model for parameters where all three species have the
same dynamics. We refer to this as the symmetric case
because the behaviour is invariant under cyclic permuta-
tion of the species. Specificall,y we take
σA = σB = σC = 1
µA = µB = µC = 1
λA = λB = λC = λ,
(12)
and there is no directional preference (ϕ = 0 or equiva-
lently P(D) = 1/4 always). The time step is τ =
1
λ+3
which ensures that all probabilities in (7) are between 0
and 1. We vary the selection rate λ and the spontaneous
death probability pω = τω. The results demonstrate the
differences between the model of this work and the (orig-
inal) RPS model of [7, 34]. They also serve as a base-
line for later Sections where the symmetry among the 3
species is broken.

Phase Diagram
We ran simulations of 105 MCS for systems of of size
L × L = 300 × 300, and a range of parameters (pω, λ).
We allow 9 × 104 MCS for the system to settle into its
steady state, after which we recorded particle densities
(ρA, ρB, ρC) of the system, which is averaged over the
time period 9×104 < t < 105 MCS. Fig. 3 shows results,
