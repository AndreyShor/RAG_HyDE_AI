where gy ∝ty g2q. Hereinafter we assume that H(1/p)
B
and H(1/p)
y
are the most relevant terms in our model.
This means that either (i) the bare amplitudes gj (with
j = B, y) are sufficiently large, or (ii) they are quite
small, such that the Hamiltonian can be studied using the
standard perturbative renormalization group (RG) anal-
ysis with the scaling dimensions of gj being smaller than
the scaling dimensions of all possible competing terms.
As pointed out in Ref. [19], it is usually possible to con-
struct such interactions. In addition, we assume that gy
is weak compared to gB.
In the same way,
we combine Eqs. (6) and (7)
with backscattering processes such that momentum-
conserving interwire coupling terms along the z direction
are obtained. In leading order in the interactions, these
terms take the form

The modified coupling amplitudes are determined by
gzν ∝tzν g2q, ˜gzν ∝˜tzν g2q, and the terms H(1/p)

are assumed to be relevant in the RG sense. Sim-
ilarly to the integer case, we focus on the parameter hi-
erarchy gy ≫gz1, ˜gz¯1 ≫gz¯1, ˜gz1 ≥0.
To simplify the above expressions, we can introduce
new right- and left-moving field of the form [28]
eRnmτνσ = [Rnmτνσ]q+1 
L†

q ,
eLnmτνσ = [Lnmτνσ]q+1[R†
nmτνσ]q.
(28)
In terms of these new fields, the Hamiltonian terms de-
fined in Eqs. (24)–(27) take the same form as their ‘in-
teger’ counterparts given by Eqs. (14)–(17) for l = 1.
Thus, by analogy with the integer case, we can conclude
the following in leading order of the perturbation the-
ory: First, the states eR1Ny11¯1 and eLNzNy¯11¯1 do not enter
the sum H(1/p)
B
+ H(1/p)
y
+ H(1/p)
z
+ eH(1/p)
z
, which makes
them potential candidates for the fractional gapless hinge
states we are looking for. Second, all other states eRnmτνσ
and eLnmτνσ enter the sum exactly once, ensuring that all
terms in the sum commute with each other and poten-
tially induce gaps in the bulk and surfaces. To make this
more explicit, we can apply the standard bosonization
procedure (see, e.g., Ref. [21]) to our system. We thus
express the right and left movers in terms of the bosonic
fields φrnmτνσ(x) as
Rnmτνσ(x) ∝eiφ1nmτνσ(x),
Lnmτνσ(x) ∝eiφ¯1nmτνσ(x).
(29)
These new fields obey the commutation relations
[φrnmτνσ(x), φr′n′m′τ ′ν′σ′ (x′)]
= irπδrr′δnn′δmm′δττ ′δνν′δσσ′ sgn (x −x′) ,
(30)
with r ∈{1, ¯1}. These relations, together with an ap-
propriate choice of Klein factors, ensure the anticommu-
tation relations of the fermionic fields [21]. However, for
our purposes, the Klein factors can be safely ignored [20].
In bosonized language, the new right- and left-moving
fields defined in Eq. (28) take the form eRnmτνσ(x) ∝
eieφ1nmτνσ(x) and eLnmτνσ(x) ∝eieφ¯1nmτνσ(x), where we
have introduced new bosonic fields
eφrnmτνσ = (q + 1) φrnmτνσ −q φ¯rnmτνσ,
(31)
satisfying nontrivial commutation relations
[eφrnmτνσ(x), eφr′n′m′τ ′ν′σ′ (x′)]
= iprπδrr′δnn′δmm′δττ ′δνν′δσσ′ sgn (x −x′) .
