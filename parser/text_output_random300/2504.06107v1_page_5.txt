FIG. 1:
Coordinates defined for the Hcc system and its
two-body decays into a baryon pair BC via quark rearrange-
ment. Here, the BC final state can form via two quark re-
arrangement pathways: B1C1 ([c1(q1q2)][c2(q3q4)]) and B2C2
([c1(q3q4)][c2(q1q2)]), as illustrated in the figure.
distance between the mass centers of charm quark pair
(cc) and the diquark pair ([qq][qq]). R13−24 and R14−23
represent the average distance between the mass centers
of the two pairs of charm quark-diquark c[qq]. Since the
two charm quarks c are identical particles, we have the
following relationships: R13−24 = R14−23, R13 = R23,
and R14 = R24.
If the average distance between the mass centers of the
two c[qq] pairs (R13−24, R14−23) is comparable to or even
smaller than the intra-pair quark distances (R12,R13,R24,
etc.), it implies strong spatial overlap between the c[qq]
clusters. Such a configuration supports the interpretation
of a compact hexaquark state, as opposed to a loosely
bound molecular system.

Two-body strong decay
In addition to mass spectra, we employ the quark-
interchange model to calculate the two-body strong de-
cay widths of doubly-charmed hexaquarks.
When the
phase space permits, the dominant two-body strong
decay for these states is the rearrangement process:
cc[q1q2][q3q4] →c[q1q2] + c[q3q4], as illustrated in Fig. 1.
While decays into a doubly-charmed baryon and a light
baryon are kinematically allowed, they are suppressed
due to diquark dissociation constraints.
Contributions
from three-body strong decays and radiative/weak de-
cays are negligible, so we focus exclusively on the above
rearrangement channel.
The quark-interchange model [62, 63] describes two-
body strong decays via quark rearrangement, driven
by the (di)quark-(di)quark interaction Vij.
This ap-
proach has successfully described decays of exotic states
like the X(3872) [64], X(4630) [65], X(2900) [66, 67],
X(6900) [68], Zc and Zb states [69, 70], hidden and dou-
ble charm-strange tetraquark [71], hidden-charm pen-
taquark Pc states [72], hidden-charm pentaquarks with
triple strangeness [73], and all-heavy pentaquark states
[74].
