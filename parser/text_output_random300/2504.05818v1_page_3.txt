In this work, to be the same with meson spectra calcula-

Then, for the strong decay of q¯qg hybrid, the simplest
case is that the constituent gluon transits into a quark-
antiquark pair first, by combining this quark-antiquark
pair with the remaining q¯q, the hybrid finally decays into
two mesons. Thus, the Hamiltonian is

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND
DISCUSSIONS
We use the same quantum number configuration as
our previous work [50] to present our numerical results,
where to form a 1−+ hybrid with lowest mass, the con-
stituent gluon should be a transverse electric gluon, and
the hybrid should be a gluon-excited state. Translating
such configuration into the quantum numbers that used
in Eq. (9), it means Sq¯q = 1, Lq¯q = 0, Lq¯q,g = 1, Jg = 1,
Lg = 1, and J = 1.

FIG. 2: Mass spectra of low-lying hybrid states with quantum
number 1−+, where states are distinguished by compositeness
and isospin. Here, the black lines denote our results, the yel-
low bands reflect experimental data from Ref. [62], the red
lines correspond to lattice QCD results referenced in [63, 64],
and the blue lines represent results from other phenomeno-
logical models [45, 65, 66].
Then, we adopt three kinds of confinements to make
our calculation, which are in screened form [1], linear
form [2], and square form [3], respectively. After using
the corresponding model parameters given in Refs. [1–3],
by just adding into the constituent gluon mass mg=450
MeV as the final piece, our spectra on low-lying light
hybrids are presented by the black lines in Fig. 1.
As we can see from Fig. 1, for ground states, our re-
sults can match very well with lattice QCD and other
phenomenological models. Especially, for the ground q¯qg
state with isospin-1, its position is just located at the
experimental result of π1(1600). While for the ground
q¯qg and s¯sg states with isospin-0, their masses can also
match with other theoretical results, although they are a
little far away from the experimental results of η1(1855).
Actually, such phenomena is nature, since the physical
isospin-0 hybrid in the light region is finally a mixture of
q¯qg and s¯sg as
