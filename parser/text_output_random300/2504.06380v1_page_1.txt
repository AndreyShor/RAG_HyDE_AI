Abstract
Hysteresis in resistance under magnetic field sweeps is a key signature
for identifying magnetism in twisted bilayer graphene and similar systems.
However, such sweeps can induce extrinsic thermal effects, complicating
interpretations. Distinguishing intrinsic magnetic ordering from extrinsic
thermal influences is crucial. In this study, we report hysteresis in the lon-
gitudinal resistance (Rxx) of a near magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene
(TBG) sample under an in-plane magnetic field (B||). The hysteresis phase
appears at the edge of the superconducting dome, diminishes deep within
