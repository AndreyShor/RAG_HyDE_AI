Fig. 3: PCA decomposition for the Y- (top row), J- (middle row) and H-band (bottom row) light curves. Color-coded are the
contributions of each of the coefficients with a 2σ range: p0 (left column), p1 (middle column) and p2 (right column). The sample
mean is shown as a solid red line. The values in parentheses are the percentages of the explained variance. Three components explain
∼90% of the variance for each of the bands.
Fe/Co/Ni emission feature in the H-band, measured between a
week or two after optical maximum, traces the outer 56Ni layer,
which could potentially be used as a way of disentangling the ef-
fects of MNi and metallicity. However, to see whether one effect
dominates over the other, a more detailed analysis of physical
properties is needed (see Sect. 6.3).
In the J band, C1 primarily captures to the relative brightness
(see Fig. 3), with a very small effect on the timing of the sec-
ondary peak. The physical properties studied by K06 predom-
inantly affect the timing of the secondary peak, so in order to
reproduce the observed behavior, a combination of these with
opposing effects on the timing would be required. For instance,
a mixture of MNi and MFe produced from electron-capture el-
ements, or 56Ni mixing, would affect the brightness and leave
the timing of the secondary peak relatively unaffected. For the
H-band C1 component (see Fig. 3), both the 56Ni mixing and
MFe produced from electron-capture elements could explain the
observed behavior, especially the latter property which has a
greater effect on the secondary peak brightness.
Although K06 did not model the Y-band light curve, the anal-
ysis of both the I and J bands can be used as an approximation.
The Y-band C0 component resembles the C1 component of the H
band, and vice-versa (see Fig. 3), which would suggest that the
same physical properties dominate these components. In other
words, the same physical properties behind C1 and C0 for the H
band could explain the behavior of C0 and C1, for the Y band.
Certain physical properties, like opacity and energy distribution,
influence the SED of SNe Ia in varying ways across different
wavelengths, possibly explaining why some physical properties
would be dominant in one band and some in others. In addi-
tion, different NIR wavelengths probe different layers within the
ejecta, and deeper than the optical, at the same epoch (Wheeler
et al. 1998), which is also a viable explanation.
The analysis of spectral features can also be used to help ex-
plain the difference in variability between different wavelength
ranges. As spectroscopic observations at NIR wavelengths are
relatively limited, theoretical models provide an excellent alter-
native. Collins et al. (2022) present 3D radiative transfer simu-
lations of double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar-mass WDs as a
plausible scenario of SN Ia explosions. These simulations show
that the NIR spectra of SNe Ia around the time of secondary NIR
peak are dominated by iron-group elements4. This is in good
agreement with previous theoretical works (e.g. K06) and obser-
vations (e.g. Marion et al. 2003, 2009). In particular, the Y band
(λ ∼1.0 µm) is dominated by Fe II, followed by Co II; H band
(λ ∼1.6 µm) is dominated by Co II, followed by Fe II; while J
band (λ ∼1.2 µm) has relatively similar contribution from Fe II,
Co II and Ca II. This is in agreement with observations, except
for the J band, where not much Co II is observed and where Ca II
is just observed around optical peak (Marion et al. 2003, 2009).
Nonetheless, this shows that despite their apparent similarity, the
NIR bands have intrinsic differences as well, thus probing differ-
ent aspects of the explosion. The opposite relative contribution
