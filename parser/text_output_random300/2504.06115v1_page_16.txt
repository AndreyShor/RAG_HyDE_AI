Boundary conditions
Integrating the holomorphic anomaly equations (3.22) determines Fg in terms of the free
energies at lower genus Fg′, g′ < g up to an integration constant fg(z) that is referred to as
the holomorphic ambiguity.
In all of our examples, the discriminant polynomial takes the form

where nC + nHC is the degree of ∆and the loci { ∆C
i = 0 } for i = 1, . . . , nC are all conifold
points while the loci { ∆HC

= 0 } for i = 1, . . . , nHC are all hyperconifold points. In fact,
the only examples where nHC ̸= 0 are (X3, [±1]3) and the dual Calabi-Yau Y3. In that case
nHC = 1 and we ﬁnd one hyperconifold point in the moduli space where an S3/Z2 appears to
shrink inside the mirror.
