We note that the coefficients Dζ,l
α and λGζ,l
α only depend on I insofar as they depend on the nuclear species
ζ. Note in principle that Dζ,l
α
can have negative values and therefore the amplitudes of this state can be
complex. However, we make the simplifying assumption that the entries are positive; negative entries can be
remedied by including phase gates at the end of the preparation with negligible cost. Given this assumption,
we prepare this state using coherent alias sampling. Given that ζ, l and α are in unary, we first have to
convert to binary and contiguize into a single index. For a system with Z ion species, the contiguized index
runs from 1 to 9Z in the worst case. The conversion can be done with just Cliffords, and the contiguization
requires no more than 2Z Toffolis (for two Z-bit adders). The steps for the alias sampling then proceed as
follows:
1. Prepare a uniform superposition over 9Z amplitudes with cost 2⌈log(9Z)⌉+2bα,l −8 for some precision
bα,l.
2. Use a QROM to load alt values and keep probabilities with a cost of 9Z Toffolis. We also use this
QROM to load b-bit approximants to the precomputed coefficients θζ,l
α
as needed in Sec. E.5.3, and
the coefficients [Y α
l,ζ]a,
1
bζ,l
α , γζ,l
α
and
1
maxp |Gζ,l
α (|kp|¯rζ
l )| as needed in Sec. E.5.4.
3. For keep probabilities with bkeep bits, apply an inequality test with cost bkeep.
4. Conditioned on the flag from the inequality test, swap the alt values using ⌈log(9Z)⌉Toffolis.
The total cost for the alias sampler is 11Z+3⌈log(9Z)⌉+2bα,l+bkeep−8. The subroutine is cheap enough that
we just assume doubling the cost to include uncomputation. As for qubits, ⌈log(9Z)⌉+ bkeep are necessary
for the QROM and bkeep for the inequality test.

Preparation of the reference state |ψ ˜
G⟩
We aim to use rejection sampling to prepare the spherically-symmetric 3D state |ψG⟩= P

α (|kp|¯rζ
l )|p⟩
with amplitudes Gζ,l
α (|kp|¯rζ
l ) = P3
a=1 Xζ,l
αagl
a(|kp|¯rζ
l ). Fixing the signs sgn(GI,l
α (|kp|¯rζ
l )) is done at a later
stage and discussed in Sec. E.5.4. We therefore define a reference state |ψ ˜
G⟩= P
p ˜Gζ,l
α (kp)|p⟩such that,
for all p, ˜Gζ,l
α ≥|Gζ,l
α (|kp|¯rζ
l )| (but chosen such that the state with amplitudes ˜Gζ,l
α is easier to prepare than
Gζ,l
α itself). Specifically, for the non-local interaction term we choose ˜Gζ,l
α as
˜Gζ,l
α (kp) =
(
maxp |Gζ,l
α (|kp|¯rζ
l )|
for p ∈♢:= {p : |k(j)
p ¯rζ
l | ≤(k∗)ζ,l
α ∀j}
dζ,l
α e−γζ,l
α ||kp¯rζ

for p ∈G\♢
(200)
where the parameters maxp |Gζ,l
α (|kp|¯rζ
l ))|, (k∗)ζ,l
α , dζ,l
α
and γζ,l
α
are classically precomputed (see Table 9).
We have used the notation k(j)
p
= P3
a=1 pab(j)
a , where b(j)
a
is the jth component of the ath reciprocal lattice
vector, and the index-free symbol G to denote the space of all valid momenta. Note also that, while the
target function is a function of the 2-norm of kp (and throughout we have used the shorthand |kp| = ∥kp∥2),
the reference state’s dependence comes in the exponent and rather depends on ∥kp∥1 = P
j |k(j)
p |. Example
reference functions are shown in Fig. 8. We combine the reference state preparation here with the local
interaction term. For the local term with s ≥0, we choose
˜Gζ
s≥0(kp) =
