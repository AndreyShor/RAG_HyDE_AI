exact particle content of the theory in order to provide a
model-independent study.
The running1 of λ is governed by its β-function,
βλ(µ) = dλ/d log µ, where µ is the renormalization scale.
Again, the exact expression of β depends on the full UV-
completed theory. However, setting aside those details,
we can expand the quartic coupling as a Taylor series:
λ(ϕ) = λ(ϕ0) +

(3)
where ϕ0 is a reference scale, and βn denotes the n-th
derivative of the β-function at this scale. Retaining only
the leading-order term in the expansion and defining the
one-loop correction as δ = βλ/λ, treated as a free param-
eter, we obtain
λ(ϕ) ≃λ(ϕ0)

The choice of ϕ0 carries no physical significance as long
as λ(ϕ0) and δ(ϕ0) are adjusted accordingly within the
region where eq. (4) is valid. Thus, for numerical conve-
nience, we set the reference scale to ϕ0 = MP .
The analysis of inflationary observables is simplified in
the Einstein frame, obtained through a Weyl rescaling of
the metric tensor of the form ¯gµν = (M 2
P +ξϕ2)/M 2
P gµν.
Applying this rescaling to the action (1) and performing
the following field redefinition:

where the Einstein frame potential is given by
U(χ) =

(7)
Therefore, since the scalar field in (6) is canonically nor-
malized, the only difference between the two formulations
is given by the functional form of ϕ(χ) in the Einstein
frame potential (7).
1 On other hand, it has been proven that the running of ξ is sub-
dominant (e.g., [17–19] and references therein), and is therefore
ignored in our analysis.

Note that in eq. (8) and in the following expressions, we
omit the argument “(MP )” for λ and δ to simplify the no-
tation. In the slow-roll regime, the inflationary dynamics
is described by the standard potential slow-roll param-
eters and the total number of e-folds that measures the
duration of inflation. The potential slow-roll parameters

imation the tensor-to-scalar ratio (r) and the spectral
index of the scalar power spectrum (ns) are given by
ns ≃1 −6ϵU + 2ηU ,
and
r ≃16ϵU ,
(12)
respectively.
The corresponding numerical results are given in
Figs. 1, 2 for N = 50, 60, respectively, where we show
r vs. ns (upper left panel), r vs. ξ (upper right), ξ vs. ns
(lower left) and λ vs. ξ (lower right) in the metric (contin-
uous) and Palatini formulation (dashed), with δ = 0.1%,
δ = 1% and δ = 3% in the loop-corrected Higgs-inflation-
like scenario. The gray (purple) areas represent the 1,2σ
allowed regions coming from the latest combination of
Planck, BICEP/Keck, and BAO data [9] (from Planck,
ACT, and DESI [8]). For reference, we also plot the pre-
dictions of quartic (brown), quadratic (orange), linear
(green) and Starobinsky [2] (black) inflation in metric
gravity, and, in the right lower panel, λ ≃0.13 (gray
dashed line), i.e., the value of the Higgs self-quartic cou-
pling at the electroweak (EW) scale.
We start by discussing the results of the metric case.
As typical of non-minimally coupled models, by increas-
ing ξ, the predictions move towards smaller values of r
and larger value of ns. When the relative loop correction
