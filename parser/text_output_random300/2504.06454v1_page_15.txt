Fig. 13 Field-dependent Jc of Nb2/5Hf1/5Zr1/5Ti1/5 for (a) arc-melted sample and (b) sample
synthesized via ball-milling and spark plasma sintering (SPS) methods. Normalized ﬂux pinning force
density fp as a function of the reduced ﬁeld h for Nb2/5Hf1/5Zr1/5Ti1/5 for (c) arc-melted sample
and (d) SPS sample. Reproduced with permission from [76].
SPS sample demonstrates superior performance under external magnetic ﬁelds, with
a more gradual decrease in Jc, likely attributed to the ﬁshtail eﬀect. As discussed in
subsection 3.2, Fe contamination from the ball-milling process during SPS prepara-
tion introduces magnetic ﬂux pinning, contributing to the enhanced Jc of the SPS
sample. Figures 13(c) and (d) compare the experimental fp(h) of the arc-melted and
SPS samples against several pinning models. In the arc-melted sample, both surface
and point pinning models align well with the experimental data. For the SPS sample,
fp(h) at lower ﬁelds corresponds to surface pinning or the double exponential model.
However, deviations are observed at higher magnetic ﬁelds due to the ﬁshtail eﬀect,
which drives an unusual increase in fp(h).
3.7 TiZrHfNb, TiZrHfTa, TiZrHfNbTa, and Ti-V-Nb-Ta
Uporov et al. reported the Jc performance of equimolar TiZrHfNb[78], prepared using
the arc-melting method and exhibiting a single-phase structure. The Tc and upper
critical ﬁeld were determined as 6.3 K and 8 T, respectively. The estimated Jc at 3
K is moderate compared to superconductors based on Nb–Ti alloys (see Fig. 14(a)).
Recently, Uporov et al. extended their Jc investigations to TiZrHfTa and TiZrHfNbTa
(see Fig. 14(b))[79]. However, the Jc values of these alloys remain below the practical
threshold of 105 A/cm2.
