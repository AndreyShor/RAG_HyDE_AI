Abstract
We discuss a one-parameter non-abelian GLSM with gauge group (U(1) × U(1) × U(1)) ⋊Z3 and
its associated Calabi-Yau phases. The large volume phase is a free Z3-quotient of a codimension
3 complete intersection of degree-(1, 1, 1) hypersurfaces in P2 × P2 × P2. The associated Calabi-
Yau differential operator has a second point of maximal unipotent monodromy, leading to the
expectation that the other GLSM phase is geometric as well. However, the associated GLSM phase
appears to be a hybrid model with continuous unbroken gauge symmetry and cubic superpotential,
together with a Coulomb branch.
Using techniques from topological string theory and mirror
symmetry we collect evidence that the phase should correspond to a non-commutative resolution,
in the sense of Katz-Klemm-Schimannek-Sharpe, of a codimension two complete intersection in
weighted projective space with 63 nodal points, for which a resolution has Z3-torsion. We compute
the associated Gopakumar-Vafa invariants up to genus 11, incorporating their torsion refinement.
We identify two integral symplectic bases constructed from topological data of the mirror geometries
in either phase.
