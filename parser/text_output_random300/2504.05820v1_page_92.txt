Table 3.1: The charm momentum fraction, Eq. (3.3). We show results both in the 3FNS and the 4FNS
(at Q = 1.65 GeV) for our default charm, and also in the 4FNS for perturbative charm. We
provide results for three different values of the charm mass mc and indicate separately the
PDF and the MHO uncertainties.

Figure 3.8: The 4FNS charm momentum fraction in NNPDF4.0 as a function of scale Q, both for the
default and perturbative charm cases, for a charm mass value of mc = 1.51 GeV. The inset zooms on the
low-Q region and includes the 3FNS (default) result from Table 3.1. Note that the uncertainty includes
the MHOU for the 3FNS default and 4FNS perturbative charm cases, while it is the PDF uncertainty for
the 4FNS default charm case.
The 4FNS charm momentum fraction is plotted as a function of scale in Fig. 3.8, both in the
default case and for perturbative charm, with the 3FNS values and the detail of the low-Q 4FNS
results shown in an inset. The dependence on the value of the charm mass is shown in Fig. 3.9.
The large MHOUs on the 3FNS result, and on the 4FNS result in the case of perturbative charm,
are apparent. The stability of the default result upon variation of the value of mc, and the strong
dependence of the perturbative charm result on mc, are also clear. Both the PDF uncertainty,
and the strong dependence on the value of mc for perturbative charm are seen to persist up to
large scales.
