corresponding components q = (q1, q3) = (cos θ, −sin θ). This yields
εq = ε11 cos2 θ + ε33 sin2 θ −ε13 sin(2θ).

Thus, the average of the strain from the 211, 310, and 321 peaks was
εavg = 0.963ε11 + 0.0373ε33 −0.374ε13,

which is predominately along the surface.
Figure 8: Strain projection maps with crack overlay for peaks (a) 211, (b) 310, (c) 321, and (d)
displays the averaged strain map εavg of a shot-peened sample.
The strain projections from the selected peaks were first centered by subtracting their respective
mean values and then combined by averaging. The contributing strain projections and the resulting
average strain εavg are shown in Fig. 8. The approach of combining information from several peaks is
somewhat justified by the apparent improved homogeneity in Fig. 8(d) compared Figs. 8(a-c).
