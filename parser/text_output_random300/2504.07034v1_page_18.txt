P2. Then, noting that the pseudo-velocity of state (1) is v1(ξ) = (u(1)
1 , 0) −ξ with u(1)
1
> 0 and
{P2} = Γshock ∩Γsym ⊂{ξ1 < 0}, it follows that vector v1 on Γshock near P2 points into Ω. It
is then expected that this holds on the whole shock Γshock, unless the jumps of the velocity and
the density across the reflected-diffracted shock are degenerate at some points (which are not
expected). Then it follows from (2.10) for Γshock that v on Γshock from the Ω–side also points
into Ω. On the sonic arc (for the supersonic reflection), the jump of the velocity is not expected,
and velocity v2 of state (2) on Γsonic points into Ω(as v2 points along the radial direction of the
sonic circle of state (2) towards its center O2 ∈P3P4). Therefore, it is expected that
v · ν ≤−C−1
on Γshock ∪Γsonic
(4.3)
for some C > 0, where v on the curves is taken from the Ω–side and ν is the outer normal with
respect to Ω.
Based on the remarks above, we define the notion of regular shock reflection solutions:
Definition 4.3. Fix the wedge angle θw ∈(θd
w, π
2 ), and let domain Λ = Λ(θw) as defined above.
An entropy solution (ρ, v) of the regular shock reflection problem in the sense of Definition 4.2
is called a regular shock reflection solution if (ρ, v) satisfies the following additional properties:
If state (2) for θw is supersonic at P0, i.e., |v2(P0)| > c2, the solution has the supersonic
reflection structure as on Fig. 4.1. If state (2) for θw is subsonic or sonic at P0, i.e., |v2(P0)| ≤
c2, the solution has the subsonic reflection structure as on Fig. 4.2. More specifically,
(i) The extended reflected-diffracted shock curve P0P2P ext
0
is C1 up to its endpoints.
(ii) (ρ, v) is continuous in Ω∩Nr(Γshock ∪Γsonic) for the supersonic or sonic reflections, and
in Ω∩Nr(Γshock) for the subsonic reflection, for some r > 0.
(iii) The solution coincides with states (0), (1), and (2) in their respective regions: for the
supersonic reflection case,

(iv) (4.3) holds for some C > 0, where v on the curves is taken from the Ω–side and ν is the
outer normal with respect to Ω.
(v) The flow is pseudo-subsonic in Ωon and near Γshock, except the except the sonic point P1
for the supersonic or sonic reflections, i.e., |v| < c on Γshock\{P1} for supersonic and sonic
reflections, and on Γshock for strictly subsonic reflections, where v on Γshock is computed
from the Ω–side.
Remark 4.4. The curve, Γshock, cannot be a straight segment. Indeed, if the shock is a straight
segment, then it lies on a vertical line passing through P2, since the tangent line to Γshock at
P2 is vertical by condition (i) of Definition 4.3. On the other hand, the tangent to Γshock at
P1 for the supersonic reflection and at P0 for the subsonic reflection is tangent to the straight
shock S1 between state (1) and (2), where, for the subsonic case, this follows from the property:
lim
ξ∈Ω, ξ→P0(ρ, v)(ξ) = (ρ2, v2)(P0) in Definition 4.3(iii) by using the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions
(2.9)–(2.10) on the shock. As we have shown above, the straight shock between states (1) and (2)
is not vertical. This shows that Γshock cannot lie in a straight line.
