Kinetic term: Tel + Tion
We begin from Eq. (33),(34) and express the kinetic term in a convenient per-particle form,
T = Tel + Tion =
ηval
X
i=1
T i +
ηion
X
I=1
T I
(83)
where the operator T i (or T I) acting on the i-th electron register (or I-th pseudoion register) is defined to
be
T i =
X
p∈G
|kp|2

|p⟩⟨p|,
T I =
X
P∈G
|kP|2

|P⟩⟨P|.

The BEkin,el, BEkin,ion routines in Fig. 3 utilize explicit quantum rejection sampling [75] to block-encode the
diagonal matrix in Eq. (84) with rescaling factors for electrons and ions respectively

loaded as part of the QROM discussed as part of the
interaction term (see App. E.5.2). Given the loaded data, rejection sampling with a uniform reference state
is good enough; the state in Eq. (86) is close to uniform given that most of the particles are electrons and
that their corresponding amplitudes are all equal and significantly larger than the nuclear terms. While the
precise success probability, and therefore the number of rounds of amplitude amplification, depends on the
particle masses, we make the conservative assumption that a single round of amplitude amplification will
suffice. We must also include the cost of adding a control to this preparation from the term selection register
in Eq. (82). The construction is similar to [29]:
1. Controlled on the momentum register |p1⟩(or |P1⟩for the pseudoion) that has been appropriately
selected by the SWUP, compute |kp1|2 (or |kP1|2 for the ions) to a second register.
2. Create a uniform state

m=1 |m⟩and perform an inequality test that checks m maxp∈G |kp|2 ≤
M|kp1|2 (m maxP∈G |kP|2 ≤M|kP1|2 for the pseudoion) and for all m passing the test outputs a flag
|0⟩indicating the desired subspace.
3. Uncompute the uniform state. As the kinetic term is implemented before the interaction term, do not
uncompute |kp1|2; we reuse it as part of that block encoding.
The total rescaling factor for the kinetic term becomes,

The cost for preparing |kp|2 is included in Table 6 (and App. E.5.4). All costs specific to the kinetic term
are included in Table 3.
