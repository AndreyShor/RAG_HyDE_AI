µ and ρ are chosen to approximate the true distribution by
matching it to the appropriate Tracy-Widom distribution. They are given by [19,20]

Table B1 provides the parameter values for the complex and real cases.
The
parameter values k, θ, α are taken from Ref. [17] and match the relevant Tracy-Widom
distribution to the Gamma distribution. The parameters a1 and a2 serve as finite-size
corrections in the Tracy-Widom scaling [19,20].
Since the singular values of a matrix Λ correspond to the square roots of the
eigenvalues of the associated Wishart matrix W = ΛΛT, the largest singular value is
given by λ1 = √κ1. It is then straightforward to carry out a transformation of random
variables to find the PDF of the largest singular value λ1, which corresponds to the
shifted exponential Tricomi distribution [24]

min(κ1). There is some subtlety here, as strictly
speaking we can have min(κ1) < 0 so y is implied to enter the imaginary domain for
some choices of n, m. Whenever this occurs we simply require y > 0 instead. Although
somewhat ad-hoc, this procedure can be justified on the basis that singular values
cannot be imaginary.
Although the case min(κ1) < 0 is cumbersome to deal with
when calculating moments analytically, due to the integral limits not being amenable
to analytical solutions, evaluating the expressions despite this yields good results and it
is possible to verify the PDF is still a unit measure numerically.
When n = m, this translates into our results being rigorously analytically correct
when n > 16 in both complex and real cases. In Fig. B1, we plot min (κ1) as a function
of n, where n = m. The figure shows the minimum possible value of z for the eigenvalue
distribution, Eq. B.1. Note that much of the left tail of fκ1(z) is near 0 for most cases due
