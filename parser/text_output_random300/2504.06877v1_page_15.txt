Integration over the fermionic degrees of freedom
Action on a Keldysh contour corresponding to Hamiltonian (1) reads as [64,67]
S [¯c, c,ϕc,ϕq,...] = SEM [ϕc,ϕq,...] + SSIS [¯c, c,ϕc,ϕq],
(31)
where SEM [ϕc,ϕq,...] is an action of electromagnetic environment of the junction and SSIS [¯c, c,ϕc,ϕq]
is the action of the Josephson junction in the electromagnetic environment:
