it ensures that any potential extended emission is not
missed.
In some studies, the SNR, which is defined as S/
√
N,
is computed to validate the presence of extended emis-
sion, which inevitably takes into account background
variations.
However, in our methodology, we strive
to minimize the reliance on background considerations.
Apart from the initial background segment necessary
for the Li-Ma significance calculation, the whole process
basically does not involve background fitting or back-
ground subtraction. The reason is that the background
of some GRBs in the entire dataset is quite complex,
which makes uniform background subtraction challeng-
ing and potentially introduces uncertainties.
4. SEARCH RESULTS AND VERIFICATION
Applying the criterion mentioned above, we found 20
GRBs satisfying the precursor and quiescent period cri-
terion among the 1819 GRBs in the past decade, and
five of them satisfying the extended emission and dip
criterion. Among the five GRBs, for the GRB 140810A,
the signal after the main emission looks more like a flare
than a persistent extended emission, so we excluded it
(Fig. 3). Therefore, according to the criterion, we get
four GRBs that satisfy the light curve pattern. In ad-
dition, although GRB 230307A does not satisfy the cri-
terion, mainly because the interval between the precur-
sor and the main emission is obviously higher than the
background, which has been proved in the Wang et al.
(2024) that by reducing its brightness and examining its
precursor, GRB 230307A is still a Type IL GRB. So we
end up with a sample of Type IL GRB with five bursts,
i.e. GRB 230307A, GRB 211211A, GRB 200914A, GRB
200311A and GRB 170228A. (Fig. 4).
4.1. Basic information of these GRBs
GRB
211211A
was
detected
at
2021-12-
11T13:09:59.651 (UTC) by Fermi/GBM, Swift/BAT,
Insight-HXMT and other telescopes (Fermi GBM Team
2021; D’Ai et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2021).
The pre-
cursor of this GRB lasts about 0.2 s with a surprising
QPO feature (Xiao et al. 2024).
The emission after
the precursor is clearly divided into two parts, a long
and hard main emission and a soft and long extended
emission (see e.g., Yang et al. 2022; Veres et al. 2023;
Xiao et al. 2024). The T90 of GRB 211211A is up to
about 50 s.
GRB 230307A is the second brightest GRB ever
recorded (Sun et al. 2025).
On 2023 March 7,
15:44:06.65 UT (T0), the GECAM −B was trig-
gered in-flight by this exceptionally bright long burst,
which is also detected by many other missions such
as Fermi/GBM (Fermi GBM Team 2023) and Konus-
WIND (Svinkin et al. 2023).
The extreme bright-
ness of this burst was first reported to the commu-
nity by GECAM-B with the real-time alert data (Xiong
et al. 2023), and subsequently confirmed by other in-
struments, leading to a large observation campaign for
this event. The first pulse of GRB 230307A was proved
to be the precursor (Wang et al. 2024), and the main
emission and the extended emission are quite clear from
the observation of the light curve.
The T90 of GRB
230307A is up to about 50 s. The light curve extraction
for GECAM was performed using the GECAMTools2.
GRB 200914A was detected on 2020-09-14T12:48:30
(UTC) by Fermi/GBM (Fermi GBM Team 2020a),
and the observations of this burst are also reported by
Konus-WIND (Tsvetkova et al. 2020) and INTEGRAL
(Mereghetti et al. 2020). The T90 of GRB 200914A is
up to about 65 s.
GRB 200311A was detected on 2020-03-11T15:16:12
(UTC) by Fermi/GBM (Fermi GBM Team 2020b),
and the observations of this burst are also reported by
Konus-WIND (Ridnaia et al. 2020). The T90 of GRB
200311A is up to about 52 s.
GRB
170228A
was
detected
on
2017-02-
28T19:03:00.17 (UTC) by Fermi/GBM (Veres et al.
2017), and the observations of this burst are also re-
ported by Konus-WIND (Tsvetkova et al. 2017a) and
Fermi/LAT (Bissaldi et al. 2017).
The T90 of GRB
170228A is up to about 60 s.
Similar to the first two GRBs (GRB 230307A and
GRB 211211A), the latter three GRBs can also be
segmented into three distinct episodes: the precursor,
which is relatively significant over the background; the
quiescent period subsequent to the precursor; and a
bright main emission, followed by a persistent extended
emission with a dip separating it from main emission.
The durations of each episode of these five GRBs are
listed in Table 1.
We find that the light curves of these GRBs exhibit
a multi-peak structure, and the occurrences of these
GRBs are not evenly distributed over time. Unfortu-
nately, there is no publicly available follow-up x-ray or
optical observation for the latter three GRBs, hence it
is unknown whether there are any kilonova signals, and
the redshifts of them are not measured.
4.2. Verification of Type IL GRB
Since no x-ray afterglow has been detected in the lat-
ter three GRBs, we can only demonstrate their nature of
