Fig. 6: Comparison between B- (top panels) and V-band (bot-
tom panels) peak absolute magnitudes vs. p1 for the Y band (left
panels) and p0 for the J band (right panels).
Fig. 10 shows a clear correlation between sBV and p0 for all
the NIR colours. Again, this is not surprising given that the NIR
templates from Lu et al. (2023) were built as a function of sBV.
However, the scatter shows the complexity of the NIR variability,
which is not completely captured by a single parameter.
In the case of the peak absolute magnitude at optical wave-
lengths (both B and V bands), we see correlations with p0 for all
the NIR colour curves (see Fig. 11).This is in line with the cor-
relations found with sBV and shows that SNe Ia with more MNi
have redder NIR colors.
The comparison against host properties presents some inter-
esting results as well. In the top panel of Fig. 12, the correlation
between log10(M/M⊙) and p0 for the different color curves is
shown. Although these correlations can be driven by a bias due
to the small sample of SNe Ia, the same trend is observed for all
color curves, where the redder objects are preferentially found in
less massive galaxies (see Fig. 12). If this were to be true, and as-
suming that more massive galaxies are also more metal rich, this
results would align with the expected effect of metallicity on the
secondary NIR peak (fig. 13 in K06), where the more metal-poor
objects would have redder NIR colors and vice-versa. However,
a larger sample would be needed to confirm this.
When the same comparison is done against E(B−V)host (bot-
tom panel of Fig. 12), we see correlations for the C0 component
of (Y−J) and (Y−H). These are mainly driven by a couple of SNe
(top right points in the bottom left and middle plots of Fig. 12):
2007ca and 2008fp, both from the CSP survey. A close inspec-
tion to the light-curve fits does not reveal any abnormality. When
comparing to another SN with similar p0 but lower E(B −V)host,
SN 2017cbv, these SNe show higher (i.e. redder) (B −V) ∼,
(Ymax −Jmax) and (Bmax −Jmax) values. When comparing to a SN
with a similarly high E(B −V)host but lower p0, 2007le, the only
difference is that the latter has a bluer Bmax−Jmax value. Whether
there is a potential bias in the estimation of E(B −V)host is hard
to tell, but the comparison between SNe, and the fact that no
correlation is seen between C0 and (J −H), possibly suggests
that the correlations found might be driven by the relatively low
statistics.
As K06 does not provide models for the color curves, and no
model for the Y band, it is challenging to gain more insight on
the physical interpretation of these PCA components.
