where in the last step we used that each m ∈M is a sum of ﬁnitely many d-dimensional unit
vectors, estimated the ﬁrst factor using (5.1a), and extracted the power 1/N from the second
factor by estimating with the uniform bound (5.2d) and Deﬁnition 3.4.
Moreover, by Proposition 5.4 the curves ρN are N-uniformly bounded in Lpcrit([0, T] × X),
so is the limit ρ. This concludes the proof of Proposition 5.8.
The weak-∗convergence ρN(t) ⇀∗ρ(t) for all t ∈[0, T] follows from the bounds in Proposi-
tion 5.5 by arguing analogously to [HrT23, Lemma 4.5].
To later obtain a lower limit inequality for the dissipation functionals, we must ensure that
the limit objects from Proposition 5.5 and Proposition 5.8 satisfy the continuity equation. This
fact is established in the following lemma:
Lemma 5.9 (Closedness of CE). Let (ρ, j, f) be a limit of (ρN, jN, f N)N∈N ⊂CE in the sense
of Propositions 5.8 and 5.5. Then, it holds (ρ, j, f) ∈CE.
Proof. By deﬁnition the set CE is closed with respect to the weak-L1 convergence of the time-
integrated embedded ﬂuxes shown in Proposition 5.5 and the pointwise-in-time weak-∗conver-
gence of the embedded concentrations shown in Proposition 5.8.
To prove the lower limit inequality for the slopes, we will employ a convergence result for
the diﬀerences of the piecewise constantly embedded concentrations. This is established next.
Proposition 5.10 (Convergence of diﬀerences). Assume (4.A1) and let (cN, F N, JN) satisfy
the a priori estimates (5.1). Let ρ be the limit of (ιNcN)N from Proposition 5.8. Recalling UN

Then, it holds u ∈L2(0, T; H1(Td)), uN →u strongly in L2([0, T] × X) and along a (not
renamed) subsequence ∇NuN ⇀∇u weakly in L2([0, T] × X).
Proof. Throughout this proof we ﬁx an arbitrary species i and omit the corresponding index.
We denote ωN = ιNwN. The strong L2 convergence uN →u immediately follows by integrating

Next, we consider the diﬀerences ∇NuN =
