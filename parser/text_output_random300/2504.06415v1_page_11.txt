quasars in the redshift-separation space, color-coded by the

20.5 and PAIR SEP ≥1.′′5 in refined pair sample is
(1−a2)Ns/NINSIG = 56%, which is comparable to other
works searching for dual quasar candidates but using
different methods (e.g., Silverman et al. 2020; Li et al.
2024). Since this is only a rough estimation, we do not
apply the correction to our large-separation pairs. But
we note that the actual number of double quasar candi-
dates in larger separations may be lower due to this un-
corrected stellar contamination. This estimated contam-
ination rate is higher than the ∼30% for < 1.′′5 pairs be-
cause the larger separations enclose substantially more
superposition stars.
2.4. Pair Completeness
Gaia’s ability to resolve pairs is incomplete, particu-
larly in the subarcsecond regime, which significantly im-
pacts direct statistical analyses as a function of separa-
tion. Gaia can resolve pairs with a resolution of approx-
imately 0.′′2 in the along-scan direction, which may be
partially compensated by multiple scans from different
directions. However, deblending two very close sources
remains challenging for Gaia due to its 3.′′5×2.′′1 photom-
etry window. Therefore, a correction for pair-resolving
completeness is required before performing statistical
analyses based on pair separation.
Shen et al. (2023a) calculated the pair completeness
as a function of the magnitude of the brighter primary
source (Gpri), the magnitude difference between the two
sources (∆G = Gpri −Gsec, where Gsec is the G-band
magnitude of the secondary source), and their angular
separation (∆θ), using Gaia EDR3 data. The photo-
metric and astrometric measurements remain nearly un-
changed from EDR3 to DR3, so the pair completeness

Figure 7. Upper panel: Fraction of newly matched sources
with insignificant proper motion (i.e., PMSIG ≤3, or PM =
NA) as a function of G-band magnitude. These sources are
obtained by randomly shifting the positions of the initial
matched DR16Q QSO sample by 10′′ and cross-matching
with the Gaia DR3 database (see details in 2.3). A magni-
tude cut of 14.5 < G < 20.5 is applied, and the Poisson error
for each magnitude bin is presented. Lower panel: The G-
band magnitude distributions of different samples. The blue
solid line represents the distribution of QSO-like companions
(PMSIG ≤3, or PM = NA) in the refined pair sample, se-
lected with z > 0.5, G < 20.5, and PAIR SEP > 1.′′5. The or-
ange dotted line shows the normalized distribution of starlike
companions (PMSIG > 3) with the same selection criteria.
The green dashed line corresponds to the normalized G-band
magnitude distribution of newly matched shifted sources,
where an additional magnitude cut of 14.5 < G < 20.5 is
applied for consistency. Normalization factors of 10% and
2% are applied to the distributions of starlike companions
and matched shifted sources, respectively, to roughly match
the total number of QSO-like companions in the refined pair
sample for clarity.
functions from Shen et al. (2023a) are still applicable to
our DR3 pair sample. The pair completeness 1/fcomp
as a functions of Gpri, ∆G, and ∆θ is also available, as
an electronic FITS table with its content described in
Table 2 from Shen et al. (2023a).

star pairs in the final pair sample of 1,120 unique pairs
