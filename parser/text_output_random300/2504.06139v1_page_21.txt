Can also occur the situation where Alice and Bob are non-local, but they
are local versus Charlie. We call such boxes two-way local along with any
box which is a convex combination of such boxes.
Deﬁnition 21. A box P is two-way local if it can be written as
P(abc|xyz) = p1
X
i
λiP AB
i
(ab|xy)P C
i (c|z)
+ p2
X
i
λiP AC
i
(ac|xz)P B
i (b|y)
+ p3
X
i
λiP BC
i
(bc|yz)P A
i (a|x)
where the pis and λis are positive and normalized.
The set of non-local tripartite correlations form a 26 dimensions poly-
tope.The set of local correlations form a sub-polytope of the two-way local
polytope, itself a sub-polytope of the non-signalling polytope.
Vertices of the local polytope correspond to boxes for which all outputs
are deterministic, they are equivalent under reversible local operations to
P(abc|xyz) =
(
1
if a = 0, b = 0, c = 0
0
otherwise.
Two-way local vertices are boxes that describe a PR-box shared between two
players while the third has a deterministic box. They are equivalent under
reversible local operations to
P(abc|xyz) =
(
1/2
if a ⊕b = xy and c = 0
0
otherwise.
Non-local vertices are more complex than the two other types. The set of
non-local vertices has 44 diﬀerent classes of vertices, which we won’t enumer-
ate. One of these class is equivalent under reversible local operations to the
natural extension of the non-local box
P(abc|xyz) =
(
1/4
if a ⊕b ⊕c = xyz
0
otherwise.
As with the generalized bipartite non-local boxes, it is possible to perform
conversions between tripartite boxes. One could also be interested in the
simulation of tripartite boxes using PR-boxes.We will, however, not go into
further details about these.
