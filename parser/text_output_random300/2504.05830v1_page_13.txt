mentary Fusion (MCF), Modal Discriminative Fusion (MDF), and Modal Specific Fusion
(MSF).
in Fig. 3, modal complementary fusion (MCF), modal discriminative fusion
(MDF), and modal specific fusion (MSF) are considered. For RGB and event
features (FR and FE), a detailed explanation will be provided below.
1). Modal Complementary Fusion (MCF): When both features
exhibit strong individual performance, we employ the concatenation method
to seamlessly combine them, leveraging the complementary strengths of each
modality. This fusion strategy allows for the effective integration of spatial and
temporal information. The formula for this fusion process is as follows,
F1 = Concat(FR, FE).

2). Modal Discriminative Fusion (MDF): Conversely, if the perfor-
mance of either modality is suboptimal, we first identify the intersection
between the two modalities through element-wise multiplication, which rep-
resents the common features shared by both. We then subtract this common
feature from each modality, effectively eliminating low-quality shared features.
This approach ensures that only the unique, high-quality features from each
modality contribute to the final representation, minimizing the impact of poor
performance in either modality. The formula is as follows,
F2 = Concat ((FR −FR ∗FE) , (FE −FR ∗FE)) .

3). Modal Specific Fusion (MSF): In scenarios where one modality
performs well while the other does not, we initially concatenate the two modal-
ities to form a combined feature representation. Following this, we employ a
simple convolutional network, which is paired with a sigmoid activation func-
tion, to learn and adaptively assign optimal weights to each modality based on
their respective contributions. This approach enables a dynamic and weighted
fusion of the modalities, allowing the network to emphasize the more infor-
mative modality while mitigating the impact of the less effective one, thereby
