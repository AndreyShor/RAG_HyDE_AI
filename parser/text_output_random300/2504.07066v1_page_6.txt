FIG. 2. Schematics of mapping relations between VLT and JT
transition points. The crossings in panels (a) and (b) denote
the 1D VLT transition points as a function of the chemical
potential µ, whereas the red spots in panels (c) and (d) denote
the 2D JT transitions in the (µ, ky) parameter space. The
on-TRIM JT transition shown in (c) will correspond to a VLT
transition around the same µc, as shown in (a). Meanwhile,
off-TRIM JT transitions must come in pairs, as shown in (d).
If appearing at opposite ky, they will correspond to two VLT
transitions that split along µ axis, as shown in (b).
avoided if and only if kc is a TRIM. Hence, JT transitions
generally fall into two categories: (a) a single on-TRIM
JT transition and (b) a pair of off-TRIM JT transitions
at the same µ(J)
c
.
Meanwhile, in the low-energy sector, a JT critical point
manifests as a 4-fold-degenerate massless Dirac fermion
living in the 3D phase space spanned by k∥and µ. Sim-
ilarly, a VLT transition at some µ = µ(v)
c
can be viewed
as a 2D doubly degenerate Dirac fermion in the (kz, µ)
space. Motivated by these observations, our strategy to
bridge between JT and VLT criticalities again exploits
the idea of dimensional reduction, further guided by an
intuitive physical picture:
• A VLT transition is the domain-wall fermion of a
JT critical point.
In the following, we will establish effective theories for
both on-TRIM and off-TRIM transitions and further ex-
plore their connection to VLT criticalities.
A.
On-TRIM JT transition
In the low-energy sector, a single on-TRIM JT critical-
ity at (kc, µ(J)
c
) is a Dirac fermion that respects both TRS
and PHS. We thus consider an effective Hamiltonian,
hs,0(k∥, µ) = v1kzγ1 + v2kyγ2 + v3µγ3,
(7)
where ky,z and µ are defined relative to (kc, µ(J)
c
). With-
out loss of generality, we choose the convention of Dirac γ
matrices as γ1 = τx ⊗sz, γ2 = τy ⊗s0, γ3 = τz ⊗σ0, γ4 =
τx ⊗sx, γ5 = τx ⊗sy, where {γi, γj} = 2δij and other γ
matrices can be generated via γij = [γi, γj]/(2i). Under
this Dirac basis, the corresponding PHS and TRS are
given by Ξ = τx ⊗s0K and Θ = iτ0 ⊗syK, respectively.
We now add the ˆy pairing domain to arrive at the vor-
tex geometry, completing the dimensional reduction. As
a mass term to hs, such a pairing term will need to anti-
commute with γ1,2,3, as well as both Ξ (to respect PHS)
and Θ (to break TRS). It is straightforward to show that
the only compatible term is hs,1 = ˜∆sgn(y)γ5, where ˜∆
represents the projected pairing amplitude onto the low-
energy basis. Taking v1kzγ1 +v3µγ3 as a perturbation, a
pair of domain-wall bound states are obtained by solving
the zero-mode equation,
[∂y −
˜∆
v2
sgn(y)γ25]ψ(y) = 0.
(8)
We consider an ansatz wavefunction ψ(y) = Nf(y)ξα
with α = ±, where the spinor part satisfies γ25ξ± = ±ξ±.
The spatial part f(y) shall be localized around y = 0,
and N is the normalization factor. Assuming ˜∆, v2 > 0,
we find two normalizable zero-mode solutions, ψ1(y) =
Nf(y)[1, i, 0, 0]T and ψ2(y) = Nf(y)[0, 0, 1, −i]T , where
f(y) = exp[−˜∆|y|/v2]. Upon a projection onto the zero-
mode basis, spanned by the Pauli matrix ρx,y,z, the dis-
persion of the domain-wall modes is found to be
˜hs(kz, µ) = v1kzρx + v3µρz.
(9)
As a 2D massless Dirac fermion, ˜hs describes a VLT crit-
icality when kz = µ = 0. For the on-TRIM criticalities,
we thus have
µ(v)

= µ(J)

up to some higher-order corrections. This quantitative
relation between vortex and Josephson topological criti-
cal points justifies our initial expectation.
B.
Off-TRIM JT transitions
Now let us turn to a pair of off-TRIM JT critical points
at (±kc, µc). Since kz remains a good quantum number
during dimensional reduction, we can classify the JT crit-
ical pair into two distinct cases based on their kz labels.
1.
Opposite kz
When two JT gap closures happen simultaneously at
opposite kz /∈{0, π}, they do not change ν0. Instead,
we expect them to change the BdG mirror Chern num-
ber CM by ±2, when the system respects Mx.
Since
kz is conserved during dimensional reduction, each JT
critical point will independently contribute to VLT at
kz = ±k0, respectively. Notably, such finite-kz vortex
gap closures are known to change the chiral winding num-
ber WS by ±2 while leaving the Kitaev Z2 index invari-
ant [57], which is congruent with the WS-CM relation in
