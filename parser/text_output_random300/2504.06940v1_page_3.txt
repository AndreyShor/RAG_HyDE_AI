Notations and Definitions
First we define some basic concepts and notations for mathematical rigor.
Definition II.1 (Finite Probability Space). A finite probability space is a pair (Ω, p) where Ωis a finite set of possible
outcomes and p : Ω→[0, 1] is a probability mass function satisfying P
k∈Ωp(k) = 1, we can abbreviate p(k) as pk. 1
Definition II.2 (Hilbert Space). Given some finite set X, the Hilbert space on X is noted as HX, which has {|x⟩}x∈X
as an orthornormal basis.
Remark II.3 (Labels in Kets). Within this paper, whenever we designate a variable x from a set X, the vectors
labeled with this variable {|x⟩}x∈X automatically denotes the basis for HX as clarified in Definition II.2. In general,
we might like to use a more explicit notation such as |x⟩X to avoid ambiguity, but within the context of this paper,
dropping the X subscript suffice.
Definition II.4 (Synthesizer). Let (Ω, p) be a probability distribution. A synthesizer is a unitary operator P acting
on HΩ⊗Hanc:
P |0⟩=
X
k∈Ω
√pk |k⟩
(7)
where |auxk⟩∈Hanc are normalized vectors, and |0⟩denotes some state that is easily achievable.
Remark II.5 (Potential Auxiliaries). In general one might write
P |0⟩=
X
k∈Ω
√pk |k⟩|auxk⟩
(8)
where Hanc is the Hilbert space of some ancilla qubits that may encode extra information. For the scope of this paper
we will ignore ancillas for simplicity and clarity. (One can always recover ancillas by either re-inserting them in
appropriate locations throughout derivation process, or by redefining the states |k⟩to incorporate potential ancillas.)
Here are definitions relating to random variables.
Definition II.6 (Random Variable). A univariate (real) variable X on a finite probibility space (Ω, p) is a mapping
Ω→R. For each k ∈Ω, we can abbreviate X(k) as Xk, with bold font and nonbold font accordingly.
Similarly, we can define a univariate complex random variable Y as mapping Ω→C and introduce abbreviations
Yk acoordingly.
Remark II.7 (Notation). We will use bold font (and usually calligraphic) to represent random variables.
Remark II.8 (Omitting Ω). In our notations we often omit Ωbecause in the scope of this paper we always fix a
single probability space.
There are some special univariate random variables that will be useful in the future.
Definition II.9. (Identity Random variable) In particular, 1 is the random variable Ω→{1}.
Definition II.10. (Indicator Random variable) Given some event A, 1A is the indicator random variable that is 1
when A is true and 0 otherwise, that is, for all k ∈Ω
(1A)k =
(
1
if A
0
if ¬A

It is convenient to label quantum states with random variables which we will define as follows:
Definition II.11 (Associated Quantum State). Given a complex univariate random variable X in finite probaility
space (Ω, p), its associated quantum state, denoted |X⟩is a state in HΩwith
|X⟩=
X
k∈Ω
√pkXk |k⟩

1 Most authors would probably use ω to indicate an element from probability space Ω. Here we use k, an index variable. The exact
mathematical object as elements in Ωdoes not matter, so in practice we could just label them with some index, that is, Ω= {ωk}i∈[|Ω|].
Then we might just represent these elements ωk with the index k. More rigorously, while k ∈Ωis not necessarily an integer index, we
can effectively think of it as an index.
