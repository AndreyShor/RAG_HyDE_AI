Basic State Analysis
To understand the behaviour of the model (under the dry adiabatic buoyancy
non-dimensionalisation) with the boundary conditions specified in 2.1, a natural
starting point is to calculate the basic state. Pauluis and Schumacher (2010) examine
steady state solutions to their simple model of moist convection, and in both Vallis
et al. (2019) and Oishi and Brown (2024) a “drizzle solution” of no motion is found
for fixed temperature conditions, and saturated upper and lower boundary conditions.
Here, the problem is similar to that of Vallis et al. (2019) and Oishi and Brown
(2024), although the analysis is conducted for the idealised climate change set up of
the Rainy-B´enard model with radiation and moist psuedoadiabatic upper boundary
conditions (outlined in 2.1), and moreover the solution is here found analytically (as
in Oishi and Brown (2024)). Once the basic state solution is known, the stability of
the system can be understood by calculating CAPE and the linear stability of the
system (from the basic state).
The basic state we find is a z-dependent state of no motion (u = 0), which is
time-independent (∂/∂t = 0). For the boundary conditions outlined in 2.1, the basic
state solution consists of a lower unsaturated region with an upper saturated region.
Dropping the hats, the basic state equations (for Pr = Sm = 1) are given by

dz2 = Ra1/2 q −qs

(30)
qs = eα(b−z).
(31)
By examining the system of ODEs, one can see that,
(29) + γ(30) =⇒d2(b + γq)
dz2
= d2m
dz2 = Ra1/2r.
Upon applying the boundary conditions in 2.1, the buoyancy can be related to specific
humidity throughout the domain by
m ≡b + γq = msurf + Rz2/2 −Rz,
(32)
where R ≡Ra1/2r. It follows that (31) can be written as
qs(q, z) = exp

α(−γq + msurf + Rz2/2 −(R + 1)z)

.
(33)
The basic state solution can be determined by solving (30), where qs(q, z) is given
by (33). Due to the non-linear Heaviside function H, (30) must be solved separately
in the unsaturated and saturated regions. These solutions are matched at the lifting
condensation level (LCL) where z = zs and q∗= q(zs) = qs(zs). The matching
conditions used at the LCL are continuity of b, q, and their first derivatives.
