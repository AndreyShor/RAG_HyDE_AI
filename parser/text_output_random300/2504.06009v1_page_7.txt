nonnegative (hence cyclically monotone). Here, we extend
this result to exponentially stable LTSI systems.
Theorem 6: Suppose that the LTSI system Σ is exponen-
tially stable. Then, Σ is of relaxation type if and only if the
Hankel operator H ∈B(L2(R+, U)) satisﬁes H ≥0.
Proof: Note that H ∈B(L2(R+, U)) due to Theorem 5
and the assumption that Σ is exponentially stable. We ﬁrst
prove necessity. Suppose that Σ is of relaxation type. It
follows that ˆΣω is of relaxation type for all ω ∈Rs due
to Theorem 1. Furthermore, due to [16, Thoerem 1], ˆΣω is
stable for all ω ∈Rs. Consequently, due to [3, Theorem 5],
the Hankel operator ˆHω ∈B(L2(R+, Cm)) of ˆΣω satisﬁes
ˆHω ≥0 for all ω ∈Rs. Note that

for all v, w ∈L2(R+, U). Due to Plancherel’s theorem,

Rs⟨ˆgω(t + τ)ˆvω(τ), ˆwω(t)⟩dω
for all v, w ∈L2(R+, U) with (spatial) Fourier transforms
ˆv, ˆw ∈L2(R+, U). Substituting the latter in (37) and chang-
ing the order of integration yields
⟨Hv, w⟩=
Z
Rs⟨ˆ
Hωˆvω, ˆwω⟩dω
(38)
where ˆvω, ˆwω
∈L2(R+, Cm) for almost all ω ∈Rs.
Therefore, H ≥0 because ˆHω ≥0 for all ω ∈Rs.
Next, we prove sufﬁciency. Suppose that H ≥0. Consider
arbitrary ¯v, ¯w ∈L2(R+, Cm). Let ˆvω = ¯v and ˆwω = ¯w for
all ω ∈Ω, and ˆvω = ˆwω = 0 for all ω /∈Ω, where Ω⊂Rs
is an arbitrary compact subset. Then, v, w ∈L2(R+, U) and
Z
Ω
⟨ˆ
Hω¯v, ¯w⟩−⟨¯v, ˆHω ¯w⟩dω = 0
(39)
due to (38) and the assumption that H is self-adjoint. The
latter holds for all ¯v, ¯w ∈L2(R+, Cm) and compact Ω⊂Rs,
hence ˆHω is self-adjoint for almost all ω ∈Rs. Similarly, ˆHω
is nonnegative for almost all ω ∈Rs. Due to [3, Theorem 5],
this implies that ˆΣω is of relaxation type and, thus, ˆgω is
completely monotone for almost all ω ∈Rs. Note that ˆgω(t)
and its time derivatives are continuous in ω ∈Rs for each
t ∈R+ because the symbols ˆA, ˆB and ˆC are assumed to
be continuous. Therefore, by continuity, ˆgω is completely
monotone for all ω ∈Rs, hence Σ is of relaxation type due
to Theorem 1.
As a consequence of Theorem 6, the Hankel operator H
of an LTSI relaxation system Σ is (maximally) cyclically
monotone and, thus, the gradient of a closed convex func-
tional [21], [22]. In fact, H is the functional derivative of the
convex quadratic functional H : L2(R+, U) →R+ given by
H(v) = 1
2⟨Hv, v⟩,
(40)
see [3, Lemma 1]. Theorem 4 shows that H is intimately
related to the (impedance passive) storage of a relaxation
system. In particular, we can write (23) as
S(z(0)) = ⟨H¯u, ¯u⟩= 2H(¯u),
(41)
where ¯u(t) = u(−t) for all t ∈R+. The latter implies that
the energy stored in a relaxation system is completely deter-
mined from the past input, i.e., its memory. In the LTI case
[3], the functional H deﬁnes a so-called intrinsic storage,
which is used to show passivity of relaxation systems from
a purely input-output perspective. An analogous derivation
is also possible in the LTSI case. As always, the main idea
is that the LTSI system Σ inherits the properties of the
corresponding family of LTI systems ˆΣω, and vice versa.
VII. CONCLUSION
We extended the classical concept of relaxation from LTI
to a class of LTSI systems. We showed that LTSI relaxation
systems enjoy the same properties as LTI relaxation systems,
i.e., they have completely monotone impulse responses, they
are impedance passive, and their Hankel operators are cycli-
cally monotone. As in the LTI case, LTSI relaxation systems
reconcile the state-space concept of energy storage with the
input-output concept of memory functional. Throughout this
paper, we made use of the properties of the Fourier transform
with respect to translation invariance to decouple the inﬁnite-
dimensional LTSI system into an inﬁnite family of ﬁnite-
dimensional LTI systems, so that properties of one can be
characterized as properties of the other.
We identify several topics for future research. It would be
interesting to investigate whether the apparent discrepancy
between internal and external relaxation can be resolved
by imposing spatial properties on the impulse response, or,
alternatively, by working in a Hardy space rather than L2. It
would also be interesting to consider LTSI relaxation from
a purely geometric viewpoint [5]. In any case, we intend
to extend the theory developed in this paper to nonlinear
systems, in the same spirit as [4]. In particular, we conjecture
that spatio-temporal input-output operators that are myopic in
space [23] with completely monotone fading memory [7] can
be universally approximated by an LTSI relaxation system
composed with an absolutely monotone readout.
