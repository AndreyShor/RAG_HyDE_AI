and we divide the proof into three main steps. In the first step, we show that the integral over the
buffer-zone can be made arbitrarily small by choosing s > 0 large enough and t ≥s large enough.
In the second step, we provide, upper and lower bound for the integral over the region given by
the union of the small squares. Finally, in the third step, we show how to combine everything to
obtain the desired result. We remark that the proof strategy follows similar lines to the proof of
[MRV16, Lemma 3.1].
Step 1: In this first step, we show that for any ε > 0, there exist R ≥1 large enough such that for all
s > 0 large enough satisfying (es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N, and t ≥s large enough, it holds that

By making the change of variables x 7→esx, using the scaling relation (3.9), and thanks to (W1) and
(W2), we obtain that the expectation on the left-hand side of (6.9) is equal to

(6.11)
Since by assumption the function χ satisfies all the conditions in (6.7), one can readily check that the
function χ(xj +e−s ·) satisfies all the conditions in (6.6), for all j ∈[J]. Therefore, by Proposition 6.1,
for any ε > 0, for all s > 0 large enough satisfying (es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N, and for all t ≥s large
enough, we have that the expectation in (6.11) satisfies the following inequality, for all j ∈[J],

Hence, plugging the right-hand side of the previous expression into (6.11), making the change of
variables x 7→xj + e−sx, and using the assumptions (6.10) on the sequence of points (xj)j∈J, we
obtain that

Since, we are assuming that χ is scaled-admissible in the sense of Definition 6.2, the quantity
edsρχ(BR,s) can be made arbitrarily small by taking s ≥0 and R ≥1 large enough.
