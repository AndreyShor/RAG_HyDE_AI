Eq. (2) vanishes, i.e., if FC(̺θ)=FQ(̺θ), then G(̺θ)=0.
This suggests that the CFIM can coincide with the QFIM
only if the underlying Riemannian structure of the quan-
tum state space is locally ﬂat (namely, with zero mean
Uhlmann curvature).
In other words, the information
about the parameters hidden in the symplectic structure
(described by the imaginary part of the QGT) remains in-
accessible through the probabilities of measurement out-
comes. This highlights the challenge in providing a geo-
metric tensor that encompasses nontrivial real and imagi-
nary parts for general POVM operators and fully recovers
the QGT within appropriate limiting scenarios.
In this manuscript, we address this puzzling discrep-
ancy by introducing the positive-semideﬁnite Hermitian
matrix C(̺θ) ≡C(̺θ, {Eω}) with elements
[C(̺θ)]ij =
X
ω
[χω,i(θ)]∗χω,j(θ)
pω(θ)
,
(5)
where χω,i(θ) ≡tr(̺θEωLi) and [χω,i(θ)]∗= tr(̺θLiEω)
is the conjugation of χω,i(θ).
Here, C(̺θ) is de-
ﬁned for general states ̺θ and explicitly depends on
the POVM {Eω}.
Due to the relation Re[χω,i(θ)] =
[∂ipω(θ)], Eq. (5) provides a generalization of Eq. (3) that
includes nontrivial imaginary parts. In the main text, we
focus on regular POVM operators such that pω(θ) > 0
for the sake of simplicity, while null POVM operators
such that pω(θ) = 0 are discussed in Appendix A, where
our main results are also recovered.
For pure states, Eq. (5) has a structure analogue to
Eq. (1) (shown in Appendix B):
[C(|ψθ⟩)]ij = 4 ⟨∂iψθ|[M(|ψθ⟩) −|ψθ⟩⟨ψθ|]|∂jψθ⟩,
(6)
where M(|ψθ⟩) ≡M(|ψθ⟩, {Eω}):
M(|ψθ⟩) =
X
ω
1
pω(θ)Eω |ψθ⟩⟨ψθ| Eω.
(7)
Furthermore, Eq. (6) shares with the QGT the prop-
erty of gauge invariance: C(|ψ′
θ⟩) = C(|ψθ⟩) for |ψ′
θ⟩=
eiαθ |ψθ⟩, where αθ is a global phase depending on θ
(shown in Appendix C). The structural analogy with
Eq. (1) and the gauge invariance property suggest re-
ferring to Eq. (5) as a semi-classical geometric tensor
(SCGT), namely a counterpart of the QGT depending
on the speciﬁc POVM.
In the following, we show that Eq. (5) enables deriving
nontrivial bounds in multiparameter quantum informa-
tion theory. First, the SCGT provides a lower bound to
the QGT for general mixed states [Observation 1], which
is always saturable for pure states. Next, the SCGT leads
to a lower bound to the QFIM [Observation 2]. Also, the
SCGT oﬀers the characterization of closeness between the
QFIM and CFIM [Observation 3] as well as measurement
incompatibility. Finally, the SCGT yields a counterpart
of the Berry phase that involves POVM operators.
Lower bound to the QGT.— Let us present and prove
one of the main results of this manuscript:
Observation 1. For a general state ̺θ, consider Q(̺θ)
in Eq. (2) and C(̺θ) in Eq. (5). It holds that
C(̺θ) ≤Q(̺θ).
(8)
The above inequality between Hermitian matrices means
z†C(̺θ)z ≤z†Q(̺θ)z for any complex vector z.
Proof. For any z ∈Cm, we write
z†C(̺θ)z =
X
ω
1
pω(θ)|tr(̺θEω ˜L)|2,
(9)
where ˜L =
P
i ziLi.
Letting X
= √Eω√̺θ and
Y
=
√Eω ˜L√̺θ and applying the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality |tr(X†Y )|2 ≤tr(XX†)tr(Y Y †) yields that
|tr(̺θEω ˜L)|2 ≤pω(θ)tr(Eω ˜L̺θ ˜L†). Inserting this into
Eq. (9) and using P
ω Eω =
1, we obtain Eq. (8). Since
|tr(̺θEω ˜L)|2 ≥0, we directly obtain that C(̺θ) ≥0.
Let us discuss the saturation of the inequality (8). For
pure states, C(|ψθ⟩) = Q(|ψθ⟩) holds for every rank-
one POVM {Eω = |πω⟩⟨πω|}, where Eω is not neces-
sarily projective (namely, EωEω′ = δω,ω′Eω does not
necessarily hold).
This can be seen by noticing that
Eω |ψθ⟩⟨ψθ| Eω = pω(θ)Eω for Eω = |πω⟩⟨πω| and thus
M(|ψθ⟩) in Eq. (7) becomes the identity matrix for any
|ψθ⟩. The consequence of this saturation will be elabo-
rated in the next section.
For general mixed states and regular POVM operators,
C(̺θ) = Q(̺θ) holds if and only if there exists a rank-one
POVM {Eω = |πω⟩⟨πω|} such that
⟨πω| ⊗⟨πω| (Li ⊗
1 −
1 ⊗Li) |ψx,θ⟩⊗|ψy,θ⟩= 0, (10)
holds for all i, ω, x, y, where |ψx,θ⟩is the eigenstate of
̺θ. It is straightforward to see that Eq. (10) is veriﬁed
for pure states since |ψx,θ⟩= |ψy,θ⟩= |ψθ⟩. The proof
of Eq. (10) is shown in Appendices D and E. The satu-
ration condition in the null-POVM case is discussed in
Appendix F.
Tighter lower bound to the QFIM.— Let us decompose
the SCGT into real and imaginary parts: Re[C(̺θ)] ≡
FC(̺θ) + I(̺θ) and Im[C(̺θ)] ≡D(̺θ), where I(̺θ) ≡
I(̺θ, {Eω}) and D(̺θ) ≡D(̺θ, {Eω}) have elements
[I(̺θ)]ij =
X
ω
Im[χω,i(θ)]Im[χω,j(θ)]
pω(θ)
,
(11a)
[D(̺θ)]ij =
X
ω
ξω,ij(θ) −ξω,ji(θ)
pω(θ)
,
(11b)
ξω,ij(θ) ≡Re[χω,i(θ)]Im[χω,j(θ)].
(11c)
In general, I(̺θ) and D(̺θ) are nonzero matrices, while
D(̺θ) = 0 holds in the single-parameter case (m = 1).

formations, see Appendix G.
