Supplementary Figure 2. 
Fig. S6. SNOM characterizations of tetralayer graphene with nonpolar and polar 
domains. a-d, Topographies of four representative tetralayer graphene samples. 
Tetralayer regions are marked by the white dashed lines. e-h, SNOM images 
corresponding to the topographies in a-d. Scale bars in (a) and (e) are 2 µm. Scale bars 
in (b), (d), (f), and (h) are 1 µm. Scale bars in (c) and (g) are 3 µm.  
 
 
Supplementary Figure 3. 
Fig. S7. Histogram of the area portion of the ABCB-type (ABCB*) to the total 
scanning area for 26 tetralayer samples in this study. 11 samples exhibit area 
proportion above 2% (yellow bars), while 15 samples show area proportion below 2% 
(red bars).
