approximative gauge β-function of SO(6), we can make a rough estimate of the scale, which
is once more MX ∼1018GeV.
Above MX the gauge coupling of SO(12) runs up to MB staying within the perturbative
regime. This is due to our choice of reps for some of the scalars. More specifically, we chose
them in such a way that the scalars are always singlets under the CG gauge group, thus
avoiding any multiplicities in the calculation of the gauge β-function of SO(12). In scenario
B the gauge coupling of SO(18) can run up to MPl staying in the perturbative regime,
although it features a very steep RG evolution. The above can be found in Figures 3 and 4.
A comment on the FG case is in order. The attempt to unify FG with internal interactions
(along the lines of [98] and [48]) comes with several difficulties. In particular, fermions should
be chiral in order to not acquire Planck scale masses and also they should appear in a matrix
rep, since FG is a matrix model. Since one can impose the Majorana condition, a solution to
the above is that we start with the SO(6)×SO(12) group as the initial gauge theory and the
fermions are accommodated in the (4, 32) rep. Furthermore, following the gauge-theoretic
formulation of gravity in order to construct a FG, we gauge SO(6)×U(1) ∼SO(2, 4)×U(1).
As such, it is very similar to the CG case, since the abelian symmetry is irrelevant to the above
study and we could identify the FG model to scenario C, with the (notable but irrelevant)
difference that there is no SO(18) gauge group above MPl.
