pressure was also recorded using the static pressure port on the same pitot-static device. The 
ambient atmospheric temperature was recorded using a Huato HE804 thermocouple probe, 
with a reported accuracy of 0.8 °C.

For the examined plume tests, regolith simulants of LHS-1, LMS-1, LHS-1D, and 40-80 
µm glass beads were individually mixed and then evenly sprinkled inside the regolith bin using a 
handheld scoop, taking care to avoid any inadvertent compaction or excessive clumping of 
material. The particle size distributions and particle shapes, as well as cohesion and shear 
strength as a function of normal load as reported by Dotson et al. (2024), were leveraged to 
provide insight into the geotechnical properties as the exact same sample materials from that 
previous study were examined during PSI investigations. Cohesion, C, was calculated for each 
examined sample by applying the exponential fit parameters, Ac and kc, for eq. 3 at measured 
sample bulk densities. The exponential fit parameters and average particle sizes (D), as 
previously reported by Dotson et al. (2024), are shown in Table 1 for LHS-1, LMS-1, LHS-1D, and 
40-80 µm glass beads. Additional information regarding these high-fidelity lunar simulants can

To initially estimate bulk density, the mass of material placed inside the regolith bin was 
recorded using a Fristaden digital scale (with published accuracy of 0.01 g), while the volume of 
the examined regolith simulant was recorded using 3-dimensional LiDAR scans of the bin,
