Figure 2: (a) Schematic structure of the system made
of five spins 1/2. Spins 1, 2, 3 are placed at the vertices
of an equilateral triangle lying on the x −y plane while
spins 4 and 5 are placed along the z−axis. Each spin is
positioned at a distance of 3 ˚A from the center. However,
even when this symmetry is disrupted, the qualitative
results remain unchanged.
The resulting solid consists of a double tetrahedron.(b) For
the qudit proposal, a sixth spin is added at the origin of the
reference system.

z /10 are the components along the z−axis
of Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions (DMI). For this
system, we choose B = 1.0 T and identical, diagonal,
isotropic Γi tensors, with components Γxx = Γyy =
Γzz = 2.2 µB, as in subsection V A. To illustrate the
results, among the 32 energy levels we selected the ones
labeled as |1⟩, |3⟩, |9⟩, |14⟩, |21⟩, |26⟩because they allow
us to create a wide set of superpositions with different
values of ∆parameter.
Figure 3: Expectation values of the Sz
i operators for the
eigenstates of the system considered in V B. In the legend,
we reported the label of the states and the value of ⟨Sz⟩=
P
i ⟨Sz
i ⟩.
In figure 3 we report the expectation values of the
Sz
i operators for the states considered above; only the
z component is shown because the other ones are almost
zero. Note that ⟨1|Sz
i |1⟩= ⟨3|Sz
i |3⟩∀i = 1, . . . , 5 while
the curves associated to the states |9⟩and |26⟩are very
similar but not identical.
In figure 4 we report the coherence factor as a function
of time, the arbitrary unit is the time requested for the
superposition |ψ⟩9,15 to reach the value of 0.001 of the
coherence factor (approximately 50 µs). For each state
|ψ⟩α,β we report the corresponding value of ∆parame-
ter. Note that, for the state |ψ⟩1,3, the curve fluctuates
around the maximal value because ∆= 0, thus the term
˜R in equation 31 can not be neglected, as discussed in de-
tail in supplementary material VI B. Anyway, as outlined
at the end of section IV C, this is the ideal condition that
we would like to achieve.
Moreover, the results show that, for each superposi-
