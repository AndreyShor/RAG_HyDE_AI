Calculate SNRLi-Ma of 
each Bayesian Block
Identify precursor and 
quiescent period 
Identify EE and Dip
1. Segment by Bayesian Block algorithm.
2. Calculate SNRLi-Ma and filter SNRLi-Ma >3.
3. Classify HSB and LSB.
1. Combine up to 10 consecutive LSBs following the first HSB as a 
quiescent period candidate.
2. Merge consecutive HSBs preceding the quiescent  period as 
precursor candidate.
3. Validate quiescent period & precursor if both durations < 2s.
1. Recognize Blocks with SNRLi-Ma < SNRLi-Ma,max/3 after peak HSB 
as Sub-HSB.
2. Merge any consecutive Sub-HSB as a single EE candidate.
3. If any Block has SNRLi-Ma < EE candidate's first block between 
peak HSB and EE candidate, confirm Dip and EE.
