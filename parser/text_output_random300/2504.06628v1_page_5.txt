FIG. 1.
Entropy production rates for a Brownian particle
immersed in the active bath. Top: the jump size has 0 mean
and 1/24 variance; Bottom: the jump size has 0.1 mean and
1/24 variance.
V NN(r, t) is updated accordingly. Using (20), we then
generate the samples XNN
0,t+∆t(x) at the next time step,
t + ∆t, and thus we obtain the numerical empirical dis-
tribution P NN(r, t + ∆t) =

i=1 δ(r −XNN
0,t+∆t(xi)).
Under a similar argument of [43] we can show that:

≤O(ε) + O(∆t), with ε the
bounds of score loss, and ∆t the time step size, n∆t ≤T.
When the active fluctuation vanishes, our approach is
consistent with [54].
Examples—We first consider the motion of a Brow-
nian particle starting from a standard Gaussian distri-
bution immersed in an active bath of temperature T
[17], diffusing in a spatially asymmetric periodic po-
tential of period L and barrier height 2V0:
V (r) =
−V0 [sin(2πr/L) + 0.25 sin(4πr/L)]. The motion of the
particle is governed by

where N(t) is a Poisson counting process with parame-
ters λ and Ai are Gaussian random variables with mean
µ and variance σ2. The numerical details and parameters
can be found in the Supplemental Material. Using our
proposed deep learning framework, we perform three nu-
merical experiments under the following conditions: (1)
active fluctuations with a mean of µ = 0 and variance
σ2 = 1/24, and (2) active fluctuations with a mean of
µ = 0.1 and variance σ2 = 1/24, respectively.
FIG. 1 illustrates the entropy production rates for this
example. In the top panel, the active fluctuation is mod-
eled by compound Poisson noise with zero mean and vari-
ance 1/24. In this case, since the noise does not have net
drift, its impact on the system is minimal, and all en-
tropy production rates eventually decay to zero, indicat-
ing that the system relaxes to equilibrium. This is similar
to the case where there is only Gaussian thermal noise.
In the bottom panel, increasing the mean jump height
of the Poisson noise to 0.1 introduces a net drift that
drives the system further away from equilibrium. As a
result, the total entropy production rate ( ˙Stot) stabilizes
to a nonzero steady-state value due to the contribution
( ˙Sact) from active fluctuations, which defines the non-
equilibrium steady state with active fluctuations break-
ing the detailed balance.
These results highlight how
the statistical properties of active noise, particularly the
mean jump height, play a crucial role in determining the
system’s dynamics and steady-state entropy production.
The validity of our deep learning approach is verified in
the Supplemental Material.
Our second example is an active polymer system con-
sisting of an active Brownian particle (ABP) cross-linker
and (n+1)m ordinary Brownian beads described in [31].
The dynamics of the active polymer is described by the
following Langevin equations:

The first equation describes the motion of the ABP cross-
linker represented by rA(t) (≡r(·)
0 (t) with the index 0
denoting the center bead); the vector r(l)
s
denotes the
position of s-th monomer in the l-th linear chain (where
s ∈{1, · · · , n} and l ∈{1, · · · , m}) and k is the spring
constant for the harmonic potential between neighboring
beads.
The active fluctuation ηact,i is modeled as the
compound Poisson process ηact,i(t) = v0,iσD,i(t) where
v0,i is the constant speed of self-propulsion and σD,i(t)
takes the values of ±1 following the Poissonian statistics
with a fixed rate r0,i [8]. The second equation describes
the dynamics of the Rouse chains in the polymer net-
work. ηth and η(l)
th are the δ-correlated thermal noises
for the cross-linker and the remaining particles, respec-
tively, which are independent of one another and have a
variance of 2kBT /Γ for each Cartesian component.
The boundary conditions for the arms in our study
are the pinned arms where the last (n + 1)-th beads
in the arms are fixed in space, i.e., Γ

n = 1, 3, 7. We set the initial state of the system to follow
a Gaussian distribution, where the mean configuration
ensures a distance of 0.5 between adjacent particles, and
the covariance matrix is specified as the identity matrix.
Fig. 2 shows the entropy production for the active poly-
mer system with m = 3, 4 arms, where each arm consists
of n = 1, 3, 7 Brownian beads and a fixed end bead in
