SI- 15
: Current driven (IDC) switching in rMR/rDMR at higher D
In SI-Fig. 21 we have plotted differential resistance, dVxx/dI, as a function of D.C. bias current, IDC, for
different filling factors ν = 2.2, 2.7, and 3.2.

SI-Fig. 21: dVxx/dI vs. IDC: Differential resistance is plotted as a function of applied IDC for 0.60 V/nm
at filling factors of ν = a) 2.2, b) 2.7, and c) 3.2. Solid circles on the dVxx/dI curve of (b) are at different
IDC values: 0 ( ), 21.60 nA ( ), 36 nA ( ), and 45 nA ( ).
Hysteresis at finite D in presence of applied IDC under B||
SI-Fig.s 22a,c,e show how differential resistance, dVxx/dI, changes with increasing B|| upto +300
mT for |IDC| ≥0 for three representative filling factors at D = 0.60 V/nm. As seen in SI- 15 for zero
D, with increasing B|| at D = 0.60 V/nm, dVxx/dI is also seen to increase upto a certain value of IDC
before the behavior is switched (defined as Is), i.e., dVxx/dI decreases with increasing B||. We can perform
the hysteresis measurement at a fixed value of applied IDC by measuring dV FW

/dI and dV BW

/dI with
forward and backward B|| sweep and calculate the reduced differential MR or rDMR defined in equation
(1). Similar to in SI-Fig. 9, if the applied IDC value is smaller or greater than Is for a choice of ν at
D = 0.60 V/nm, we get a reversal of sign in rDMR where we cross over from positive (negative) to negative
(positive) rDMR as we change applied D.C. bias current from IDC < Is to IDC > Is as demonstrated in
∆dVxx
dI (B||, IDC) 2−d colormaps in SI-Fig.s 22b,d,f before the collapse of rDMR at a higher bias current
(IDC > 60 nA).
In SI-Fig.s 23a,b,c, we have plotted the differential resistance, dVxx/dI vs. IDC with increasing
temperature, T, for ν values of 2.2, 2.8, and 3.2 at D = 0.60 V/nm. We observe that dVxx/dI increases
with T (dRxx
dT |ν > 0), but at a finite value of IDC(≡Is), dVxx/dI decreases with increasing T (dRxx
dT |ν < 0).
Thus, as we see in SI-Fig.s 22b,d,f, for IDC > Is, increase in temperature with B|| sweep will lead to a
‘downwards’ BMR and switching in the sign of the rDMR.
