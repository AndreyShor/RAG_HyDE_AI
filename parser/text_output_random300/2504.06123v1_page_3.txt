show that the total error ϵn is upper bounded by n times
the local error (i.e., bounded by Lemma 1) cannot be
directly applied, due to the non-unitary nature of ITE.
Instead, we show in the Appendix A that ϵk is given by
a recursive relation of the form
ϵk ≤ϵk−1A + B
(6)
where A = 1 + 4∆β∥H∥∞and B = 10∆β2∥H∥2

such, the error ϵn is upper bounded by a geometric series

which establishes the following bound.
Theorem 1:
The error ϵn between the ITE state
|ψ(β)⟩(1) and the state |ϕn⟩(4) created by n steps of
RGD with step size ∆β = β
n is upper bound by

Thus, for β∥H∥∞≪1, such that the second order of
eβ∥H∥∞can be neglected, the complexity for preparing
the corresponding ITE state through RGD is of the order
O( β2∥H∥2

ϵ
). Such a short ITE has been used in primitive
subroutines in other quantum algorithms, such as the
quantum Lanczos or the quantum minimally entangled
typical thermal states algorithm [3, 36]. Thus, Theorem 1
provides error guarantees for the implementation of these
subalgorithms via RGD.
We further remark that since by the triangle inequality
we have ∥|E0⟩−|ϕn⟩∥≤∥|E0⟩−|ψ(β)⟩∥+ϵn, Theorem
1 allows us to bound the error for preparing the ground
state |E0⟩of H via RGD [18–20]. However, Theorem 1
goes beyond ground state preparation as it bounds the
error for preparing a generic ITE state. This includes
preparing excited states, which can be achieved by ini-
tializing the system in a state that has zero overlap with
the ground state.
Gradient flow-based quantum algorithms for quantum
imaginary time evolution – The RGD update step Uk =
e−∆βgradJ is, in general, not efficiently implementable
on a quantum computer. As the Riemannian gradient
gradJ ∈su(2N) generally lives in an exponentially large
Lie algebra su(2N) of dimension 22N −1 where N is
the number of qubits, we can in general not hope for
implementing Uk with polynomially many gates. How-
ever, several approximation schemes have been intro-
duced in the literature that project the Riemannian gra-
dient into smaller dimensional subspaces to make the up-
date step efficiently implementable, e.g., through Trot-
terization [18–21]. The key idea is to pick a polynomi-
ally sized subspace Ak ⊂su(2N) in each update step
k. The Riemannian gradient is then projected into this
subspace to obtain an approximate Riemannian gradient

= ⟨gradJ, iPj⟩,
e.g., through the parameter shift rule or finite differences
[37, 38]. Here, ⟨X, Y ⟩= Tr{X†Y } denotes the Hilbert-
Schmidt inner product.
A particularly appealing strategy is to project into a
randomly chosen directions Pj (in the tangent space) in
each update step [20]. For ground state problems, this
randomization strategy convergences to the ground state
almost surely despite the existence of saddle points [18].
Here, we employ a similar randomization strategy to ef-
ficiently implement Uk on average.
Consider sampling in each update step k a gate V (j)
k
=
e−iCk,jD∆βPj by picking uniformly random a (normal-
ized) Pauli operator iPj ∈su(d) where D = dim(su(d)) =
d2−1. We recall that the coefficients Ck,j are determined
by (9) and depend on the state of the previous step. To
gain some intuition on how this randomization procedure
gives rise to implementing ITE, we start by considering
the energy change ∆Ej = ⟨ϕ| H |ϕ⟩−⟨ϕ| V (j)†

at the step k for some state |ϕ⟩.
For a step size
∆β = 1/(4D∥H∥∞) this change is lower bounded by

Sampling Pauli op-
erators Pj from su(d) uniformly gives, for any A, that

. As such, we find that the average
energy change ∆E = Ej[∆Ej] at a single random step k
is lower bound by
∆E ≥∥gradJ∥2

The Hilbert-Schmidt norm ∥· ∥HS of the Riemannian
gradient gradJ = [H, |ϕ⟩⟨ϕ|] is given by the variance
∥gradJ∥HS =
q
⟨ϕ| H2 |ϕ⟩−⟨ϕ| H |ϕ⟩2, which is zero
only at eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. As such, on aver-
age a randomized step corresponds to the energy change
that is obtained for one step of RGD. In fact, to first or-
der in the step size, the averaged evolution is described
by the unitary quantum channel that corresponds to one
step of RGD.
