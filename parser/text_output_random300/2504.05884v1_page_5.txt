nets around the probe would increase the signal-to-noise
by inducing a higher magnetic field in the sample.

Appendix A: 2D scans line profile fitting
All 2D scans were summed together to determine where
the average signal strength was across all scans. Due to the
dipole shape of the signals, the 2D gradient of the image
in the X direction was used to determine the centre of the
dipole feature by finding the position where the gradient
was the most negative. The X and Y coordinates of this
point were used to draw a line profile vertically and hori-
zontally through each of the individual 2D scans for each
concentration. This then highlighted that, again due to the
dipole nature of the signal, the vertical line profile passed
through the centre of the dipole where there was no sig-
nal change. The decision was made then to only use the
horizontal line profile.
For each line profile, a linear baseline between the first
and last data point was subtracted. This helped remove
any any linear trend related to slow changes in signal over
the scan that are caused by temperature changes or slowly
varying magnetic fields.
This also helped remove large
static background field gradients across the line profile.
After the line profile was processed, a Gaussian deriva-
tive function of the form
f(x) = −A(x −µ)
σ2
e−(x−µ)2
2σ2
+ c,
(A1)
where A is the peak amplitude, µ is the peak position or
zero crossing point, σ is the standard deviation or width of
the peak and c is a signal offset.
The difference between the maximum and minimum val-
ues of the fit was taken as the the signal amplitude (A2).
This value was divided by the standard deviation of the
line profile data to find the SNR (A3).
fa = f(xmax) −f(xmin),

noise.

The error on the SNR values was taken to be the sum
of squares of the relative error of the signal amplitude and
the signal noise,

where σfa is the error of the signal amplitude and σnoise
is the error of the signal standard deviation.
Firstly the error of the signal amplitude was found by
using the square root of the sum of the squares of the error
of the fit at the x position of the maximum and minimum
values.

The 95% confidence intervals of the fitting parameters
were used as the errors for each parameter.
Appendix B: Signal vs height line profile fitting
Five height line profiles (line profiles moving in the z
direction away from the sample) were taken for each con-
centration. Firstly each of the five height line profiles was
baselined by subtracting the last data point, the signal fur-
thest from the sample, from the line profile. The baselined
data was then fitted with a power law function of the form
f(x) = a + bxc,
