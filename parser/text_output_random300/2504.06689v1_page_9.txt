construction of expressions, tracing, and their subsequent evaluation during rational reconstruc-
tion, replaying the existing trace with different inputs. Recent algorithmic improvements in the
reconstruction of rational functions are presented in Refs. [61,62]. In principle, the need for IBP
reduction can be side-stepped using techniques from intersection theory, for an introduction see
Ref. [63], several advances in this direction were presented in Refs. [64–68]. Significant devel-
opments in the methods and tools used for simplifying the resulting reduced expressions have
also been achieved. The FUEL package provides routines for the manipulation of rational func-
tions, a tool for partial fractioning such expressions was described in Ref. [69]. In Refs. [70,71],
advances in techniques for directly obtaining simplified expressions using p-adic numbers were
presented.
The methods used to calculate Feynman integrals continue to evolve. Several new ideas
and methods have been presented in the literature and existing techniques have been refined
and applied in new contexts. The use of canonical differential equations, for an introduction see
Refs. [72,73], remains an essential technique. Previously, all integrals required for 2 →3 massless
scattering had been computed and expressed in terms of (analytic) pentagon functions [74–80].
Recently, the master integrals required for five-point one-mass scattering have also been obtained
analytically [81,82] using the differential equations method. In Ref. [83], a family of planar two-
loop massless six-point master integrals relevant for 2 →4 scattering were obtained using the
technique. As the number of loops, scattered particles and internal/external masses increases,
it is increasingly common to encounter functions beyond multiple polylogarithms (MPLs), for a
review of the various developments see Ref. [84]. Very significant advances have occurred in this
area in recent years, stemming from joint research by both the phenomenology and amplitude
communities. These advances have helped to clarify the analytic properties of integrals beyond
MPLs and is enabling their numeric evaluation, see e.g., Refs. [85–100]. When a fully analytic
solution of the differential equations cannot be obtained, the use of generalised series expansions
as implemented in DiffExp [101] and the recent SeaSyde package [102] remain indispensable.
The method of Auxiliary Mass Flow [103–105], as implemented in AMFlow [106], is also used
in many cutting-edge calculations either to directly evaluate the relevant master integrals or for
obtaining high-precision numerical boundary values for differential equations.
Methods to evaluate integrals directly in parameter space, either analytically as imple-
mented in e.g.,HyperInt [107], or numerically as implemented in Fiesta [108, 109] or py-
SecDec [110–113], continue to be developed and used in modern calculations. A procedure to
efficiently evaluate parameter integrals based on tropical Monte Carlo quadrature [114] has been
implemented in the public tool feyntrop [115] and applied also to integrals in the Minkowski
regime. The analytic and numeric computation of Feynman integrals via their Mellin-Barnes
representation provides another avenue of research, for a recent introducion and review see
Ref. [116]. Feynman integrals satisfy a Gel´fand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) system of partial
differential equations, an automated package, FeynGKZ, to derive the associated GKZ system
and solve it in terms of hypergeometric functions was presented in Ref. [117].
Various new
approaches have also been developed in the last few years. In Ref. [118], A method of evalu-
ating Euclidean integrals via positivity constraints was derived. In Ref. [119], a procedure for
reformulating Feynman integrals as integrals over a small set of parameters was proposed.
Loop–Tree Duality provides a framework for treating real and virtual corrections simul-
taneously, this can help to avoid having to separately treat the IR divergences arising in and
then cancelling between the amplitudes. Progress continues to be made in this direction, some
recent advances were presented in e.g., [120–126]. We also point the reader to the reviews of
Refs. [127,128].
