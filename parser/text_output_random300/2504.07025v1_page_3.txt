Figure 2. Overview of neural glossy object reconstruction with polarization cues. Our method consists of three main steps (1‚Äì3):
data acquisition, neural radiance field-based representation, and polarization rendering. This work employs neural rendering techniques
in conjunction with the fundamental principles of polarization to generate a polarized image. These coupled modules allow for acquiring
only one single polarization image at each viewing angle and then recover geometry and material properties through the optimization of
rendering loss. Components marked with upward diagonal strips, such as DiffuseNet and SpecularNet, are optimized during training,
while those with grid checker patterns are calculated using corresponding equations.
ple camera poses surrounding the target object and capture
a single polarization image Iœïpol at each view with our low-
cost data acquisition system, as shown in Fig. 1. Next, in
alignment with prior study [7], we employ VolSDF [33] and
Ref-NeRF [27] as the fundamental blocks for modeling the
neural implicit surface and decomposed radiances. Then,
we harness the polarimetric BRDF model to accurately esti-
mate Stokes vectors sout. Furthermore, we introduce an end-
to-end polarization rendering layer, which first estimates the
polarizer‚Äôs angle œïpol and then incorporates physical rules to
render a polarized image Iout
œïpol, which is compared with the
captured ground-truth for loss calculation.
As in Fig. 2, our method utilizes a polarization image
Iœïpol as the input and initiates by sampling a collection of
3D locations along each camera ray. These locations are
processed through a coordinate-based neural implicit sur-
face module, facilitating the estimation of signed distances
and surface normals. Along with view directions, separate
radiance networks are employed to determine the diffuse
and specular components. This separation allows us to ef-
fectively handle the non-Lambertian properties exhibited by
the surface. Combined with the polarimetric BRDF model,
the outgoing Stokes vectors sout can be obtained, which lay
the foundation for polarization-based rendering. The details
on these methods can be found in supplementary materials.
Next, we present a differentiable processing pipeline to
estimate the polarizer‚Äôs angle œïpol, eliminating the need for
precise polarization angle measurements and facilitating the
implicit rendering of desired polarized images Iout
œïpol for loss
calculation.
Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive
analysis of the fundamental principles of polarization and
its application in aiding the reconstruction and radiance de-
composition in Sec. 8. Moreover, we illustrate the rationale
behind the efficacy of using a single polarization image per
view to achieve our goals and elucidate the distinctions be-
tween this approach and prior methodologies in Sec. 3.3.
3.2. Polarization-empowered Rendering
In this approach, we take the estimated outgoing Stokes
vector sout as input, which characterizes the polarization
state of light and is represented by a four-dimensional vec-
tor [s0, s1, s2, s3]. From this, we calculate the fundamental
polarization information as follows:

thbf {I}_\te xt {un} = \frac {1}{2}s_0, ~\rho = \frac {\sqrt {s_1^2+s_2^2}}{s_0}, ~\phi = \frac {1}{2}\text {arctan2}(s_2,s_1), 
(1)
where œÅ is the degree of polarization (DoP), œï is the angle
of polarization (AoP), and Iun is the unpolarized intensity.
On the one hand, the polarized intensity Iœïpol (i.e., the
captured image) exhibits sinusoidal variation with the rota-
tion angle of the polarizer œïpol, as shown below:
  \la b el {e q : pol} \ m athbf { I}_{\phi _\text {pol}} = \mathbf {I}_\text {un}\left ( 1 + \rho \cos (2\phi - 2\phi _\text {pol}) \right ).

Using Eq. 1, the only unknown variable œïpol can be easily
solved given sout and Iœïpol.
Moreover, Mueller matrices are only valid in the aligned
reference coordinate system when considering the light
passing through a polarizer. Therefore, for a linear polar-
izer with a rotation angle of œïpol, its Mueller matrix must be
deduced according to [5]:
  \la b el
 {eq:mueller_lp} \mathbf {M_{\phi _\text {pol}}} = \mathbf {R_{\phi _\text {pol}}^T} \mathbf {M_{LP}} \mathbf {R_{\phi _\text {pol}}},

where Rœïpol is the rotation matrix and MLP is the Mueller
matrix of an ideal linear polarizer with the horizontal trans-
