Proof. We first check (9) for the orthonormal basis in Lemma 1. The sum over αβ in T αβ ⊗T αβ and
˜T αβ ⊗˜T αβ gives

(δa,αδb,β + δa,βδb,α)(δc,αδd,β + δc,βδd,α) −(δa,αδb,β −δa,βδb,α)(δc,αδd,β −δc,βδd,α).
Only the cross terms survive, yielding

(δa,αδb,βδc,βδd,α + δa,βδb,αδc,αδd,β) = δa,dδb,c

(δa,αδb,β + δb,αδa,β).
The first term in the sum gives 1 for a < b and 0 for a ≥b. The second term is 1 for b < a and 0 for
b ≥a. Adding and subtracting δa,b yields
δa,dδb,c(1 −δa,b).
We assume a ≤c (otherwise we swap a, b with c, d) and obtain for the sum over T k ⊗T k,

Because 1/(k(k + 1)) = 1/k −1/(k + 1), the sum over k yields 1/c −1/N. Altogether we get
δa,bδc,d(−1
N + δa,c).
Adding the sum over αβ and the sum over k, we see that the terms with three Kronecker deltas (implying
a = b = c = d) cancel and (9) follows.
To get the result for any orthonormal basis we transform T i to T ′i = ST iS−1 for some invertible n×n
matrix S. In components, we get for P

N Saa′(S−1)a′bScc′(S−1)c′d) = δa,dδb,c −1
N δa,bδc,d.
This completes the proof of the proposition.

Note that in Figure 4 the orientation of the external half-edges is preserved. This promotes (9) to a
two term relation which is the oriented analog of the classical tree term relation in graph theory (the
cross term is forbidden because it is in conflict with the orientation of the edges).
With (4) we can eliminate all adjoint vertices fijk and with (9) we can eliminate all non-oriented
edges between two chains of oriented edges. For any graph with at least one vertex, we finally obtain
a result which is a product of (1) oriented chains with any number of non-oriented external half-edges
(products of T i) and (2) closed oriented loops with any number of non-oriented external half-edges (traces
of products of T i). In the case of a ‘vacuum’ graph with no external half-edges, we only get a sum of
oriented self-loops δa,a = N. Then, RG(N) ∈Z[N, N −1].
For practical purposes, it is useful to derive formulae for small cycles. We have (see Figures 3 and 5)
δa,a = N,
