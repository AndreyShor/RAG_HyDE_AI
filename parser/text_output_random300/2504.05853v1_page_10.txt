NOTES ON COLOR REDUCTIONS AND γ TRACES
10
In the following lemma we summarize more properties of γ products and γ traces.
Lemma 10. We sum over iterated indices and assume that the dimension D is not an odd integer. Then

Tr Sn = Tr ˜Sn.
Proof. (1) We substitute (24) for γαkSk−1 = γαkγα1 · · · γαk−1 into the first equation of (25) yielding
γβSnγβ = (−1)n(D −2)Sn + 2

The first sum is −2(n −1)(−1)nSn and the result follows.
(2) For even n we use (24) for Sn = γα1S1
n. The result follows from the cyclicity of the trace.
For odd n the proof is by induction over n. The case n = 1 is (22). For n ≥3 we use (29) which
simplifies by induction and by cyclicity of the trace to DTr Sn = −(D −2n)Tr Sn. Because D is not odd,
we have D ̸= n and the result follows.
(3) If n is odd, then (31) is trivial. For even n we use induction over n. For n = 2 the result follows
from the cyclicity of the trace. For n ≥4 we use (30) for γα1γαn · · · γα2. We obtain by induction
Tr ˜Sn =

After k 7→n + 2 −k the result follows from (30).
□
The algorithm for calculating Tr Sn is evident. If n is odd, then Tr Sn = 0. Otherwise, we search for
the smallest r (if existent) such that Sn or any of its cyclic permutations has a sequence γβγβ1 · · · γβrγβ
for distinct β, β1, . . . , βr in {α1, . . . , αn}. We simultaneously reduce all cases with r = 0, 1, see (28). For
r ≥2, we use (29) for an iterative reduction. If r does not exist because all γ matrices in the trace have
distinct indices, then we use (30). In this case, the formula for a complete reduction is universal for a
fixed number n of γ matrices. This allows us to cache all results up to n = 16. Moreover, we use (21)
and (29) to order γ products without trace.
One can further improve the algorithm by caching all γ traces that are not amenable to the first
reduction step with r = 0, 1. In this approach, reduction with (26) insead of (29) can be preferable
because the former generates less terms. This has not (yet) been implemented.
In a QFT with γ matrices in vertices, we benefit from the fact that in a single ferminon loop, half of
the gamma matrices are contracted. At loop order ℓwe are left with 2ℓindices that are not contracted.
In the case of several fermion loops, it is important to start with the evaluation of the trace with the
smallest number of uncontracted indices. There exists a loop with ≤2ℓuncontracted indices, so that the
degree in Kronecker δ’s is always ≤ℓ.
We tested the Maple implementation HyperlogProcedures [10] by calculating the traces in Feynman
graphs that contribute to the photon propagator. The average computation time on a single core of an
office PC is approximately two minutes for ℓ= 6 loops and 30 minutes for ℓ= 7. For graphs with ℓ≤5,
the calculation is nearly instant.
