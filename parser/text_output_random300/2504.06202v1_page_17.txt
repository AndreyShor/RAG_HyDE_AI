Figure 4.1: Case (2a) in the proof of Lemma 4.8. The subcluster C′
1 is in purple and it intersects
some ball Bδri(z0) with z0 ∈∂Bri (small one in cyan). The larger ball (in cyan) centered at z0
is of radius 2δri. γ′
1 in pink is a loop inside Aδri,1.5δri(z0) that surrounds Bδri(z0). η2 in red is
an excursion part of the loop γ2 in Bri that intersects Λ0. The distinguished arc J that joins the
endpoints of η2 is in green, and its (2δri)-sausage is enclosed by the green loop. γ3 is a loop in
J(2δri) \ J(δri) that surrounds J(δri). The two small squares represent the first hitting of J(δri) by
η2 from some point on η2 ∩Λ0 in both directions. These two squares are connected by an orange
bridge inside J(2δri) ∩Bri, which is used to construct the new loop γ′
2. We also draw some clusters
in black hooked by η2 ∪J(2δri) in Lri.
is allowed. Next, we choose some z0 ∈∂Bri such that Bδri(z0)∩C′
1 ̸= ∅. Let η2 (chosen in arbitrary
way) be an excursion of γ2 in Bri such that it intersect Λ0. Let J be the arc on ∂Bri that joins the
endpoints of η2 and J ∪η2 does not surround C′
1. Let J(a) := {w : dist(w, J) ≤a} be the a-sausage
of J. We will consider the following two subcases:
• Case (2a): There does not exist a ball B2δri(z) with z ∈∂Bri such that B2δri(z)∩C′
1 ̸= ∅and
(C′
1 ∪B2δri(z)) ∩Λ(η2 ∪J(2δri), Lri) ̸= ∅. Since Bδri(z0) ∩C′
1 ̸= ∅by our choice of z0, it follows
that (C′
1 ∪B2δri(z0)) ∩Λ(η2 ∪J(2δri), Lri) = ∅. See Figure 4.1 for an illustration. Therefore,
with some positive cost depending only on δ, we can make all the following happen:
– There is a loop γ′
1 in Aδri,1.5δri(z0) := B1.5δri(z0) \ Bδri(z0) that surrounds Bδri(z0).
– There is a loop γ3 in J(2δri) \ J(δri) that surrounds J(δri).
– We truncate η2 when it first hits J(δri) from some point on η2 ∩Λ0 ⊂Bri−1 in both
directions, and then hook the two hitting points inside J(2δri) ∩Bri by a bridge to get
