reflects the challenge of approximating such nonlinearity using a limited number of principal 
components and a linear regression framework.  
Together, these residual plots validate the earlier conclusion: the efficacy of linear modeling is 
heavily influenced by the underlying spectral transformation mechanism. For Ti metasurfaces with 
gradual, linear intensity shifts, PCR with 80 components offers precise, unbiased predictions. For 
Si metasurfaces, while PCA-based modeling still performs reasonably well, nonlinear modeling 
techniques may be required for further enhancement. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study investigated the performance of full spectrum machine learning models, specifically 
principal component analysis followed by linear regression, in predicting refractive index changes 
from simulated absorption spectra of metasurface-based biosensors. By comparing four datasets 
representing different material (Si, Ti) and polarization (TE, TM) configurations, we demonstrated 
that the predictive accuracy of linear models is strongly influenced by the nature of the underlying 
spectral changes. Ti-based meta-gratings, characterized by broadband intensity modulation with 
minimal spectral peak shifts, yielded exceptionally low mean squared errors (MSEs) and tightly 
clustered residuals. In contrast, Si-based structures with sharp nonlinear Mie resonances showed 
limited enhancement in performance when modeled using the same linear framework. 
The results emphasize the importance of spectral shape in determining the compatibility of 
linear models with optical sensing data. While PCA-based regression is highly effective for 
intensity-modulated spectra, its performance is comparatively limited for spectra dominated by 
resonance shifts. Additionally, the large fold enhancements, exceeding 6000 times for the Ti-based 
structure and TM polarization, underscore the value of utilizing the entire spectral information 
rather than relying solely on isolated peak positions. These findings support the use of data-driven 
feature selection, even in traditional one-dimensional fitting approaches, and suggest that future 
work incorporating nonlinear modeling could further improve the interpretability and accuracy for 
complex resonance-based systems.
