ture of kilonova ejecta, influencing both transient emis-
sion and the synthesis of heavy elements, mostly elements
that are much heavier than Fe [19–21].
As the kilonova evolves from the diffusion phase to
the nebular phase, recombination alters ionization frac-
tions, leading to changes in spectral line intensities and
the emergence or suppression of features in the optical
and near-infrared regions. The rate coefficients for DR
in r-process elements exhibit strong temperature depen-
dence, particularly for singly to doubly ionized species at
T ∼104 K. Even slight variations in ejecta conditions
can lead to substantial differences in ionization balance,
directly affecting kilonova spectra. In contrast, RR typi-
cally dominates in lower-temperature environments, such
as those encountered during the nebular phase of super-
novae. Therefore, accurate temperature-dependent DR
rates are essential for reliable spectral modeling and the
interpretation of transient astrophysical events.
The importance of DR in kilonovae also stems from
the complex electron shell structures of heavy elements,
which result in dense energy levels and numerous au-
toionizing states. These states enhance the efficiency of
DR. The photon emission in DR during radiative stabi-
lization, known as dielectronic satellite emission, serves
as a crucial diagnostic tool for interpreting kilonova spec-
tra and constraining plasma parameters such as temper-
ature and electron density. As a result, DR-driven emis-
sion plays a vital role in X-ray spectroscopy and plasma
diagnostics, offering valuable insights into the physical
conditions of astrophysical plasmas [4, 22].
Low-charged heavy ions such as Y+, Sr+, Te2+, Ce2+
[23–25] have strong relevance to kilonovae.
Observa-
tions by the James Webb Space Telescope have detected
doubly charged tellurium in GRB 230307A, while singly
charged strontium was detected in kilonova AT2017gfo,
highlighting the importance of accurate recombination
data for understanding low-charge ions in astrophysical
plasmas [23, 24].
Heavy ions with excited states near
the ground state (e.g., Y+, Sr+, and Ce2+) exhibit com-
plex DR behavior even at low densities, leading to dis-
crepancies in ionization balance calculations. Addition-
ally, different elements contribute uniquely to kilonova
opacity and spectral features; Sr and Y produce strong
optical and near-infrared transitions, making them de-
tectable in kilonova spectra, while Te and Ce, with their
intricate electronic structures, significantly affect mid-
infrared opacities. The recombination rates of these el-
ements govern their ionization fractions over time, di-
rectly shaping the spectral evolution of kilonovae. Thus,
incorporating precise recombination data is essential for
improving kilonova models and accurately interpreting
their spectral signatures.
Accurate data on DR rates, oscillator strengths, and
cross-sections for electron impact are crucial for quantita-
tive analyses of astrophysical spectra, particularly in kilo-
nova ejecta and non-LTE plasmas. However, the scarcity
of DR data for key r-process elements such as Y, Sr, Te,
and Ce introduces uncertainties in modeling ionization
balance and spectral evolution. The dense energy level
structures of heavy elements further complicate direct
comparisons of recombination rates, as these rates can
vary significantly across different ions and even among
transitions within the same species. Due to the experi-
mental challenges in measuring DR rates for low-charged
heavy elements, most astrophysical models rely on ex-
trapolations from lighter elements [26] or simplified ap-
proximations, which can introduce significant inaccura-
cies in simulations.
In particular, models of kilonovae
and non-LTE plasmas often depend on crude estimates
for low-charged heavy ions, where discrepancies from ac-
tual values can reach an order of magnitude, directly im-
pacting astrophysical predictions.
It is also important
to note that the theoretical study of low-charge heavy
ions is rather challenging. While numerous studies have
focused on highly charged heavy ions [27–35], research
on low-charge heavy ions remains very limited. To ad-
dress this gap, the present work employs state-of-the-
art atomic structure calculations to provide reliable DR
rate coefficients for such ions. These theoretical bench-
marks are essential for improving the accuracy of simula-
tion models, refining ionization balance calculations, and
enhancing the interpretation of observational data from
neutron star mergers and other transient astrophysical
events.
To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one
of the first computations for the present targets. No ex-
perimental measurements have been found in the litera-
ture, and the only theoretical calculations available are
from a recent study by Banerjee et al. [36], which covers
only a few of the ions studied in this work. Another key
objective is to provide reference data for experimental-
ists to facilitate state-of-the-art research in this field. Re-
cent experimental advancements have enabled the study
of low-charge heavy ions at the cryogenic storage ring
of the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Hei-
delberg [37]. Notably, successful experiments have been
conducted on Xe3 ions, marking one of the highest mass-
to-charge ratio DR experiments ever performed. How-
ever, such experimental efforts face numerous challenges,
including the difficulty of generating such ion sources in
the laboratory, managing high background noise, and de-
tecting weak DR signals, which are often lost in the back-
ground [37]. Given the current limitations of laboratory
experiments, theoretical calculations such as those pre-
sented here are required. They provide critical insights
and benchmarks not only for experimentalists striving
to overcome these challenges but also for astrophysi-
cists aiming to model and interpret complex astrophysi-
cal phenomena with greater accuracy.
Section II of this article covers the theoretical specifics
that are employed in the present work. The computa-
tional results are discussed and presented in Section III,
while Section IV contains some concluding remarks.
