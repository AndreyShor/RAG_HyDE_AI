Algebras Bn and Dn
We have not studied this case thoroughly; however, at least for algebras Bn≥6 and Dn≥7 we
can show that there are no solutions involving only fields with positive chirality beyond those
that can be embedded in M-theory. To reach this conclusion, it is sufficient to examine the
trace identities [57]
trsym,a F 6 = (2n ± 32) tr F 6 + 15 (tr F 4)(tr F 2) ,
trsym,a F 4 = (2n ± 8) tr F 4 + 3 (tr F 2)2 ,
trsym,a F 2 = (2n ± 2) tr F 2 ,
(3.27)
where sym and a stand for the symmetric and adjoint representations of rotation groups and
for the cases where the spin representation is relevant i.e. less than 248, we need [55]
tr64 F 6 = 8 tr F 6 −15
2 (tr F 4)(tr F 2) + 15
8 (tr F 2)3 ,
tr64 F 4 = −4 tr F 4 + 3 (tr F 2)2 ,
tr64 F 2 = 8 tr F 2 .

Up to certain normalization, equations (3.27) and (3.28) give us the coefficients u(1)

needed to look for solutions for the systems (3.12) and (3.13). There are
only two solutions to these equations, and they are precisely those that embed in the M-theory
E8-brane. In fact, both have appeared before: one solution was worked out in Section 2 via
the embedding E8 ⊃SO(16). The other corresponds to SO(14) ⊃G2. Therefore, under the
assumption of positive chirality this analysis allows us to rule out algebras Bn≥6 and Dn≥7.
However, we have left out potentially interesting cases from the analysis, namely SO(n) for
7 ≤n ≤12, which we did not study explicitly due to the large number of representations
involved and the lack of explicit formulae for some anomaly coefficients. All in all, algebras
deserve more attention, as their spin representations might yield new solutions that have no
analog other algebras. We hope to return to this in the future.

SU(2) algebra
We have left the particular case of SU(2) for last, since, even though it is the simplest Lie
group, the aboundance of representations with dimensions blew 248 makes a complete analysis
cumbersome. However in this particular case, the Casimir invariants are at most of order two,
and they are known explicitly by the same techniques we applied to the exceptional groups.
Thus to analyze this case we have to deal only with the following set of inhomogeneous
