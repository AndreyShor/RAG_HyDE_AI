Extended Data Fig. 4 | Distinct electronic structure between pentalayer rhombohedral and
Bernal stacking graphene. a, Optical image of non-aligned R5G/BN (sample S3), with red, blue
and black curves indicating R5G, pentalayer Bernal graphene (B5G) and electrodes. b, Spatially-
resolved NanoARPES intensity map with a similar range to the optical image. The NanoARPES
intensity is obtained by integrating intensity from EF to -1.0 eV. c,d, Experimental dispersion
images measured on R5G and B5G along Î“-K direction (vertical line in the inset).
