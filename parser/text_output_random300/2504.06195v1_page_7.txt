Figure 3. Absorption spectra of the structure at the environment with varying refractive indices of 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 
using (a) Ti with TM, (b) Ti with TE, (c) Si with TM, and (d) Si with TE polarization. 
Figure 3 shows how the absorption spectra change with variations in the refractive index of 
the surrounding environment, ranging from 1.3 to 1.5. The meta-grating is simulated under TM 
and TE polarizations for both Ti and Si nanorods. Figures 3(a) and (b) correspond to the Ti-based 
structures, where the overall spectral shape remains consistent across different refractive indices. 
The dominant change is in the intensity of absorption at specific regions, rather than shifts in 
spectral position. This is more evident by the only resonance almost not shifting at all by varying 
the index. A few wavelengths that appear to exhibit relatively strong monotonic intensity changes 
are marked on the plots. These points represent wavelengths with the most prominent index-
dependent intensity changes and are typically chosen in intensity-modulationâ€“based biosensing 
approaches.
