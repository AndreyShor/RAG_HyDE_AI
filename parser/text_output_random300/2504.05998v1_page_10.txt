Considerations regarding the rotating wave approximation
The model analyzed in this work is based on the rotating wave approximation, in which non-resonant processes are neglected.
For this approximation to be valid, the rates of dissipative processes must be much smaller than the relevant system frequencies.
Focusing on a single optomechanical system (disregarding, for the moment, the gravitational interaction), this approximation
amounts to neglecting the effect of back-action noise. In the weak coupling limit g ≪κ (consistent with the parameters of Fig. 1
in the main text and Fig. S.1), this is valid if the natural thermal mechanical noise rate γ NT is much larger than the light-induced
mechanical noise rate γ◦N◦, where γ◦is the light-induced dissipation rate, and N◦describes the effective number of thermal
mechanical excitations associated with residual heating due to light scattering. Under the resonant condition analyzed in this
work, γ◦= 4g2/κ, and N◦is given by the sideband cooling limit, N◦= κ2/4ω2
B. This implies that for our model to be valid, it is
necessary that NT ≫g2

B . This condition is fulfilled for the parameters in Fig. 1.
We note that in the low mechanical frequency regime, the validity of this approximation requires particularly low cavity
linewidths κ. This is one of the challenging aspects of our proposal. For larger values of κ one has to relax the rotating wave
approximation, so that the expression for the output spectral mode at frequency omega (S.8) must be generalized to include the
coupling with the input spectral modes at the frequency −ω −2ωB, taking the form
aout2(ω) = α1(ω) ain1(ω) + β1(ω) bin1(ω) + α2(ω) ain2(ω) + β2(ω) bin2(ω)

in2(ω + 2ωB),
(S.23)
where a†
in1(ω + 2ωB) = ain1(−ω −2ωB)†. This implies that our optical channel from ain1(ω) to aout2(ω) would couple to
additional, uncontrolled dissipative ports through the input fields at −ω−2ωB. As a result, additional noise would be introduced,
reducing the non-classicality of the single-mode channel. A more efficient test in this scenario would probably require analyzing
the two-mode channel from the two input modes ain1(ω) and ain1(−ω−2ωB) to the two output modes aout2(ω) and aout2(−ω−2ωB).
Notice that non-classicality criteria exist for general multi-mode Gaussian channels [18], but they are not as simple as the
criterion for a single-mode attenuator introduced in (8).

THE GENERAL CASE IN WHICH S 1 AND S 2 ARE NOT SYMMETRIC.
In this work, we focused on the simple case in which the optomechanical systems S 1 and S 2 have the same parameters (ωA,
ωB, κ, γ, NT, etc.) because it significantly simplifies the analytic derivation of the main results. However, in this Section, we
show that the symmetry between S 1 and S 2 is not a strong assumption and that similar results can be obtained even in a regime in
which S 1 and S 2 are asymmetric. Specifically, here we assume that the two systems can be different with mechanical frequencies
ωB,j, mechanical dissipation rates γ j, optomechanical couplings gj, detunings ∆j = ωA,j −ωpump,j, and optical linewidths κ j, for
j ∈1, 2. In any case, we assume that the parameters allow for the rotating wave approximation as discussed in the main text. In
particular, we assume that the mechanical frequencies are sufficiently close

 ≪ωB,1, ωB,2. In this case, it is useful
to use a different picture where the optical fields rotate at the laser frequencies [as in Eq. (1) of the main text]. The quantum

In this picture the frequency ω = 0 corresponds the frequency of the laser fields, meaning that the input spectral mode at optical
frequency ωpump,1 + ω is resonantly coupled to the output spectral mode at frequency ωpump,2 + ω.
