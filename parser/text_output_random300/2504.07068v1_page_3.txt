For a given (n, ǫ), we deﬁne the minimal qubit and entanglement rates as
Q(n, ǫ) := 1
n log |M|

E(n, ǫ) := 1
n(S(A0) −S(A1))

such that there exists an (n, ǫ) code with |M| and S(A0) −S(A1). We say that a qubit Q and entanglement rate E
are asymptotically achievable if there exists a sequence of codes {(Cn, Dn)}n such that
Fn ≥1 −ǫn
and
Q(n, ǫ) ≤Q + δn
and
E(n, ǫ) ≤E + ηn,
for some vanishing non-negative sequences {ǫn}, {δn} and {ηn}. The optimal qubit and entanglement rates are deﬁned
respectively as
Q∗= inf{Q : Q is achievable},
E∗= inf{E : E is achievable}.
Two distinct notions of feedback is introduced in [2] as passive feedback and coherent feedback. In a passive feedback
model, the encoder obtains a copy of the decoder’s output. For quantum channels, it is not possible to give the encoder
a copy of the decoder’s output because of the no-cloning theorem. A coherent feedback of a channel is deﬁned as
an isometry in which the part of the output that does not go to the decoder is retained by the encoder, rather than
escaping to the environment. Classical and coherent feedback are thus rather diﬀerent notions.
Remark 1. We consider coherent feedback in this paper, and refer to it simply as feedback. Our model uniﬁes the
(coherent) feedback and non-feedback simulation of [2] in a single model as follows. If we assume that the source state
ρAR is pure, and we let system K = E or K = ∅then we recover the feedback or non-feedback channel simulation of
[2], respectively.

DECOUPLING CONDITION AND RATE FUNCTIONALS
The ﬁdelity criterion of Eq. (2) implies the decoupling lemma below, where we show that the distilled entanglement
systems A1B1 are decoupled from the rest of the systems. We apply this lemma in our converse proofs. The proof of
this lemma is presented in Sec. A of the Appendix.
Lemma 2. The ﬁdelity criterion of Eq. (2) implies that the decoded state on systems A1B1 is decoupled from the rest
of the systems in the following sense

and the binary entropy h(ǫ) = −ǫ log ǫ −(1 −ǫ) log(1 −ǫ).
The mutual information is with respect to the decoded state ξn.
In Deﬁnition 3 described below, we deﬁne two functions of a state ρAR. Our main results are that, these func-
tions characterize the optimal simulation rates. Theorem 6 of the manuscript states that the optimal entanglement-
assisted rate for the simulation of the channel N : A →BK is equal to a(ρAR, 0).
Theorem 8 states that the
