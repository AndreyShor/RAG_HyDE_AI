different coupling scenarios is needed in order to identify the most interesting regions of
parameter space at very small couplings. Combining all of these different strategies will
enable us to further explore the parameter space of leptophilic ALPs.

Experimental details
A.1
E137
An electron beam with an energy of 20 GeV was directed at an aluminium target. Over
the course of the experiment, a total of 30 C (Coulombs) of electrons were deposited in
the dump, corresponding to Ne = 1.87 · 1020 electrons on target (EOT). The target was
placed in front of a hill 179 m in length, which absorbed all SM particles except neutrinos.
The detector was placed behind the hill, providing a decay length of 204 m. The detector
consisted of an 8-radiation-length shower calorimeter, which could detect photons and
electrons.
For the first phase of the experiment, the detector was arranged in a 2 × 3
mosaic of 1 m × 1 m chambers, which was later changed to 3 m × 3 m chambers. The cutoff
energy for the detector, i.e. the minimum ALP energy to be considered a candidate, was
set to 2 GeV. No candidate events were observed.

Invisible mode
The detector consists of one electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and three hadronic calorime-
ters (HCAL). The ECAL consists of lead and scintillator plates, having a total length of
45 cm and a width of 23 cm×23 cm. The ECAL is the active target and detects the energy
deposition of electrons. Each HCAL is made of iron and scintillator plates intended to
