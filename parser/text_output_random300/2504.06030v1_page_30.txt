Another way of probing the behaviour of, R0(θ) = R′′
r(r0(θ), θ) is to consider the

where r = r0(θ) is the polar equation of the curve of a classical periodic orbit, R and S
satisfying our semi-classical equations in 2-dimensions.
Firstly, δr =

|R0|

2 sin(ψ −θ), is the radial width of our 2-dimensional tube centred on
C0 where collisions are most likely to occur after converging to C0. The normal width
of the tube perpendicular to the width is δrn, where
δrn = δr sin(ψ(θ) −θ),
ψ(θ) is the angle which the tangent to C0 at (r0(θ), θ) makes with the x-axis. Since
for sufficiently small ϵ, |∇R| ∼0, inside the tube, the velocity, v, of P is such that
|v| ∼
