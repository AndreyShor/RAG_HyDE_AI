where the proportionality constant is chosen in such a way that E[1] = 1.
Remark 2.12. We observe that the fact that the proportionality constant in the previous proposition
lies in (0, ∞) follows directly from Definition 2.7 of the field Ψλ, together with the fact that the
proportionality constant appearing in that definition lies in (0, ∞).
As claimed above, we now state a result that confirms that the field Ψλ, introduced in Definition 2.7,
is indeed canonical. Specifically, we have the following result, whose proof is given in Section 5.3.
Proposition 2.13. For any λ1, λ2 ∈Λ, one has Ψλ1
law= Ψλ2.
Since the law of Ψλ does not depend on λ, except possibly for a countable number of “bad” values,
we just write Ψ from now on.

Stable convergence of supercritical GMC
We now state our main result regarding the convergence of GMC measures. Before proceeding, we
fix for the remainder of this section the set Λ ⊆R+ introduced in Lemma 5.1 below. We also let Ψ
denote the field introduced in Definition 2.7, which, as noted in Proposition 2.13, has a law that does
not depend on λ ∈Λ.
We begin by introducing the assumptions considered in our next main theorem.
Assumption 2.14. For n ∈N, consider a collection of fields (Wi,t)i∈[n],t≥0 on Rd such that:
(W1) For any t ≥0, the collection of fields (Wi,t)i∈[n] is independent of the σ-field Ft defined in
(1.5).
(W2) There exist stationary fields (Wi)i∈[n] on Rd such that, for any fixed t ≥0,
(Wi,t(·))i∈[n]
law= (Wi(et·))i∈[n] .
(W3) For 0 ≤s < t and for all x, y ∈Rd such that |x −y| > e−s, it holds that
(Wi,t(x))i∈[n] ⊥(Wi,t(y))i∈[n] .
(W4) For all γ >

2d, it holds that supx∈Rd

(2.11)
The subscript λ is not included in the notation a⋆since it turns out that the right-hand side of (2.11)
does not actually depend on λ ∈Λ, as shown in Lemma 5.8 below. We are now ready to state our
next main theorem, with the definition of stable convergence provided in Section 3.2.
Theorem C. Let γ >
√
2d and consider the sequence of measures (µγ,t)t≥0 defined in (1.9). For
n ∈N, consider a collection of fields (Wi,t)i∈[n],t≥0 satisfying (W1) – (W4). For each t ≥0 and
each i ∈[n], define the measure µγ,t,i by
µγ,t,i(dx)
def= eγWi,t(x)µγ,t(dx) .
