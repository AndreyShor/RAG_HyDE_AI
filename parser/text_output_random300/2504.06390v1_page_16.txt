enhances carrier localization and polaron binding, thereby increasing the effective nonlinear
optical response. The shifts in the absorption minima toward higher photon energies mirror
the broadening of the energy gap seen in the linear regime, demonstrating that external
fields can simultaneously modulate both linear and nonlinear optical characteristics.
These findings are consistent with earlier studies on nonlinear optical behavior in pola-
ronic systems under external fields32,33 and underscore the potential of field-tunable polar
substrates to enhance the nonlinear optoelectronic response of graphene-based heterostruc-
tures.
Figure 4 illustrates the total optical absorption coefficient, which combines both linear
and third-order nonlinear contributions, as a function of photon energy for the same four
polar substrates: h-BN, SiC, SiO2, and HfO2. Panels (a) and (b) show the cases without
(F = 0) and with (F = 0.3 V/nm) an applied in-plane electric field, respectively, for magnetic
fields B = 0.05, 0.07, and 0.1 T.
