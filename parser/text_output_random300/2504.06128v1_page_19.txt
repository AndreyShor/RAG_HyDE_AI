SINGULARITY AND REGULARITY OF THE CRITICAL 2D SHF
19
The idea is to approximate the SHF with the directed polymer partition function. Recalling
the convergence in distribution (3.8) in the critical regime (1.19), we abbreviate
WN,k :“ Zβcrit
N pkq
tN
`

Nq
˘
where

.
(3.10)
For fixed k P N, we have WN,k Ñ Yk in distribution as N Ñ 8. Therefore we can choose
N “ Nk large enough so that ErΦpWNk,kqs is close to ErΦpYkqs. Let us define
N1 :“ min
␣
N P N: |ErΦpWN,1qs ´ ErΦpY1qs| ď 1
(
,
Nk :“ min
␣
N ą Nk´1 : N ě ek|ϑk| and |ErΦpWN,kqs ´ ErΦpYkqs| ď 1

(
,
so that we have by construction N1 ă N2 ă . . . and, for every k P N,
Nk ě ek|ϑk| ,
|ErΦpWNk,kqs ´ ErΦpYkqs| ď 1
k .
(3.11)
By the triangle inequality, our goal (3.9) holds if we show that
lim
kÑ8 ErΦpWNk,kqs “ ErΦpY qs .
(3.12)
We claim that this holds by (1.25), because the directed polymer partition functions WNk,k
from (3.10) satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 1.8. Note indeed that:
‚ the sequence βcrit
N pkq for N “ Nk is in the quasi-critical regime (1.22), since by (3.10)

with

where |ϑk| ! log Nk holds by the first inequality in (3.11);
‚ the initial condition UBpx

Nq for N “ Nk satisfies the requirement that δϑk Ó 0
at rate (1.24), because by definition δϑk :“ e
1
2 ϱ ϑk “ e´ 1
2 ϱ |ϑk| as in (1.11).
We can thus apply Theorem 1.8 to pWNk,kqkPN: relation (1.25) along the subsequence N “ Nk
yields directly (3.12) and completes the proof.
□
Remark 3.3. The strategy in the proof of Theorem 1.2 is very general and it shows that
the convergence in distribution (1.20) or (1.21), which are proved for each ϑ in the critical
regime (1.19), can effectively be transferred to the quasi critical regime (1.22), provided we
take ϑN Ñ ´8 slow enough. This naturally leads to Metatheorem 1.15.
3.3. Long-time behaviour of the SHF. We prove Theorem 1.4 on the long-time
behaviour of the SHF. This is a corollary of Theorem 1.1 on the singularity of the SHF,
together with the following scale-covariance property, proved in [CSZ23a, Theorem 1.2]:
@a ą 0:
Z ϑ
at
`
UBp0,?a Rq
˘ d“ Z ϑ`log a
t
`
UBp0,Rq
˘
,
(3.13)
which holds for any t, R P p0, 8q and ϑ P R.
Proof of Theorem 1.4. To prove (1.13), it suffices to show that
@R ă 8:
Z ϑ
t
`
UBp0,Rq

d
ÝÝÝÝÑ
tÑ8

(3.14)
which follows if we show that for some fixed α P p0, 1q the fractional moment vanishes:
@R ă 8:
