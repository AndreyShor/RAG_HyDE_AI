FIG. 2. Density of States (DOS) for MAPbI3 and SbH4PbI3.
The plots display the total DOS along with the individual
contributions from the organic cation (MA for MAPbI3 and
SbH4 for SbH4PbI3), Pb, and I. Fermi level is not normalized
to zero in these plots. Energy is given in electron volts (eV).
Figure 1 displays the optimized structures of MAPbI3
and SbH4PbI3. For SbH4PbI3, the computed lattice pa-
rameters are a = 6.23 ˚A, b = 6.30 ˚A, and c = 6.36 ˚A.
It is observed that, except for a slightly decreased a pa-
rameter, the overall lattice size is comparable with that
of MAPbI3.
The major structural difference between
the two perovskite systems stems from the hydrogen-
bonding networks. In MAPbI3, the organic MA+ cation
forms three N–H· · ·I hydrogen bonds with neighboring io-
dide ions, on average with bond length of approximately
2.71 ˚A. The inorganic SbH+
4 cation in SbH4PbI3, how-
ever, forms four hydrogen bonds with an average bond
length of approximately 2.94 ˚A. Additionally, while the
MA+ cation will push the iodide ions in towards the PbI−
3
lattice, the SbH+
4 cation likes to bond with the iodide ions
on both sides of the lattice, resulting in an outward dis-
placement of the ions. Such a discrepancy in hydrogen-
bonding interactions can result in minor changes in lat-
tice parameters and local structural distortions that im-

strengthened hydrogen-bond network of SbH4PbI3 can
help with the increased structural stability without pro-
