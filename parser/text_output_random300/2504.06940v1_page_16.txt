Moreover, let the corresponding eigenstate (with eigenvalue eiα for G be |α⟩with norm 1, the theorem also states

Remark III.6 (Constructing Grover Gate). Given O(1) access to a quantum experiment (and its inverse) to the
random variable X, by Remark II.35 we can construct a quantum experiment for θ. By Definition II.36 we can
construct the phase oracle for θ which gives us access to G discussed in Theorem III.5
