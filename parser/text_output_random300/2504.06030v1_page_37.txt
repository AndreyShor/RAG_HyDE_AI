in p is proportional to ϵ|R0|
1
2 sec α, for the above α. So there is a residual Heisenberg
Uncertainty principle at work.
It should be possible to prove an equivalent theorem in 3-dimensions using the methods
of Ref. [12]. We leave this as an exercise, assuming small z. The relevant result from
Ref.
[12] is that the leading term, which is all we are concerned with here, in the
asymptotic expansion of I(λ), I(λ) =

where x0 is assumed to be the unique stationary point x0, with g′(x0) = 0, x0 ∈(a, b);
I(λ) = O(λ−∞) as λ →∞, when there is no such x0 ∈(a, b). Here f ∈C∞
0 (a, b),
g ∈C∞(a, b), g being real-valued. (See Ref. [12]).
In any case in 2-dimensions we have proved the following theorem.
