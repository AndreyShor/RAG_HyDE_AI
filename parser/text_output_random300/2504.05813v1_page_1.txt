Abstract. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the
collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been
essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying
their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used
as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by
a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach
for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations suffer from
divergent terms (0/0), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new
approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic
curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the
Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we
apply our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the
time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH
mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in
PBH formation.
