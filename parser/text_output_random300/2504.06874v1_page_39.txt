line marks the boundary between the ABCA domain and the ABAC domain. The KPFM 
results of device 3 are consistent with those of device 1 (Fig. S6), device 2 (Fig. S10) 
and device 3 (Fig. S13). All the scale bars in (a), (b) and (c) are 3 Âµm.

Fig. S22. Full dataset for the gate-dependent SNOM of device 4. a-q, SNOM images 
at different Vg following the sequence of applied Vg in our experiment. The range of the 
applied Vg is between -100 V and 170 V. The optical near-field response between the 
two adjacent polar states (polarization directions indicated by triangles in (a)) becomes 
almost identical at around Vg = 170 V (f), indicating a strong hole doping in the sample 
at Vg = 0 V. This means that the sample is heavily hole-doped at Vg = 0 V, which prevent 
our tetralayer from being electron-doped. We note that fringe features appear in the 
vertical direction of SNOM images presumably due to the interference effect caused by 
the scattered light from nearby silver paste used to make sample contact. r, Optical 
contrast between the two adjacent polar stackings, as a function of Vg. The extracted
