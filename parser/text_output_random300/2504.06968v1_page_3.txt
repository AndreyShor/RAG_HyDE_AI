the look-elsewhere effect), corresponding to a Gaussian-equivalent significance> 4.20σ. We find
that the relativistic hydrogen-like high-atomic-number ions entrained in the GRB jet can generate
such narrow MeV emission lines through the de-excitation of excited electrons.
Results
Light curve and spectral analysis. GRB 221023A triggered the GBM onboard Fermi at 20:41:34.92
UT on 23 October 2022 26. Simultaneously, this event was also detected by Konus-Wind 27 and
AGILE (Astrorivelatore Gamma ad Immagini LEggero) 28. The GBM light curve shows one bright
peak with a total duration time T90 about 39 seconds (s) in the 50 −300 keV energy band 26, and
the fluence reported in the Fermi-GBM catalog is F = 3.41 × 10−4 erg cm−2 in the energy range
10 −1000 keV 29. The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)30 instrument was triggered during this
event, and the highest-energy photon detected is a 17 GeV event with a 99% probability which is
observed 576 seconds after the GBM trigger 31.
Panels a, b of Figure 1 presents light curves for GRB 221023A at different energy bands. We
analyzed the spectral evolution of the GRB prompt emission by spectra in 5 adjacent time intervals
(labelled A (0−5 s), B (5−8 s), C (8−30 s), D (30−36 s) and E (36−60 s)). The spectra of time
intervals 0 −5 s, 5 −8 s, 30 −36 s and 36 −60 s can be fitted with a Band function (see methods
subsection Spectral fitting), detailed analysis results are summarized in Table 1. Interestingly,
when fitting the spectra in time interval 8 −30 s using the Band function, as shown in the a and
b panels of Figure 2, revealing a distinct narrow and bright emission feature between 1 MeV and
3 MeV. This narrow emission feature can be well modeled by adding a Gaussian component on
top of the Band function (see methods subsection Spectral fitting), the best-fit parameter values
are α = −0.93+0.01
−0.01, Ep = 891.07+3.03

σgauss = 229.36+93.57
−45.29 keV, the c and d panels of Figure 2 displays the corresponding fitted counts
rate and νFν spectrum. We also present the best-fit νFν model spectra in 5 adjacent time intervals
in Figure 3. In time interval 8−30 s, comparing models with and without the Gaussian component,
we obtained ∆AIC = 51.87, ln(BF) = 9.99, and ∆χ2 = 40.14, which strongly supports the
presence of an additional narrow emission feature (see methods subsection Model comparison). In
order to exclude the impact of background subtraction on the extracted spectrum, we calculated
the background spectrum by selecting several different time windows. The result of the narrow
emission feature is substantially unaffected (see methods subsection Background).
We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis on time interval 8−30 s to further investigate
the presence of the observed feature and to characterize its evolution. We used a fixed window size
of 13 s, sliding it in steps of 3 s to divide the time intervals, resulting in four subintervals, referred
to as 8 −21 s (C.1), 11 −24 s (C.2), 14 −27 s (C.3), 17 −30 s (C.4). In four subintervals, we still
