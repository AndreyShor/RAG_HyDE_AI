Abstract
This supplementary information file comprises additional data and analysis for
the following experimental and theoretical aspects of the Timing the Escape
of a Caged Electron article: (i) Circumventing beam damage; (ii) Valence
band photoemission for bulk Ar@C60; (iii) Comparison of Ar 2p core-level
photoemission and Ar 2p →4s X-ray absorption spectra; (iv) Fitting the
Auger-Meitner decay spectra; (v) Comparison of photoemission lineshapes for
bulk and monolayer Ar@C60 samples; Doniach-Sunjic asymmetry; (vi) Raw
on-resonance decay spectra for multilayer and monolayer Ar@C60 coverage;
(vii) Population analysis: Ar and C contributions to excited state; (viii) Orbital
symmetry decomposition; (ix) Comparison with time-dependent DFT; (x) Rel-
ativistic considerations; (xi) Z+1 approximation and ground state K@C60; and
(xii) Ar-Ag(111) separation: Additional DFT calculations.
