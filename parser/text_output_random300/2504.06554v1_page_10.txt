FIG. 6. Population dynamics of the |n,e⟩sq states for n = 0,1,2,3
during the GRAPE pulse for the Hadamard gate, with the initial state
being (|g⟩+i|e⟩)(|0⟩−|1⟩)/2. The |3,e⟩sq state is observed to have
the highest population fraction of 8.73% among all 36 initial cardinal
states. The populations for states with larger photon numbers are
smaller, with the maximum population of the |4,e⟩sq state being only
1.56%.
consists of Fock states |0⟩s and |1⟩s, at least two distinct pump
frequencies are necessary. In addition, the Hadamard gate
in this experiment is implemented using the gradient ascent
pulse engineering method (GRAPE) [46, 47], during which
the storage cavity may contain a higher photon number. To
ensure the controlled damping remains effective during the
GRAPE pulse, the microwave pump must cover the frequency
range corresponding to the largest photon number present dur-
ing the evolution. To reduce photon occupation, we extend the
GRAPE pulse duration, which results in a lower gate fidelity,
and ultimately settle on a pulse length of 3 µs after balancing
these factors. The numerical simulations show that the pho-
ton number remains below four during the evolution, with the
population of the |4,e⟩sq state being less than 2%.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
This experiment is implemented on a sample based on a 3D
superconducting cavity-QED architecture [32, 48], in which a
transmon qubit is dispersively coupled to a high-Q 3D storage
cavity and a low-Q strip-line readout cavity. As described in
the main text, the transmon qubit serves as the reusable qubit
and the lowest two Fock states of the storage cavity form the
mediating qubit. The device parameters and coherence times
are presented in Table I and Table II. Since the transmon qubit
experiences significantly greater decoherence than the stor-
age cavity, the experiment focuses on mitigating errors from
the transmon qubit by controlling its decoherence and using
noise-extrapolation techniques to counterbalance the deleteri-
ous effects.
In our experiment, the high-power microwave pumps for

Ωf0g1 are realized using four independent microwave drives,
each with equal amplitude and frequency intervals. The low-
power microwave pumps for Ωef consist of four sidebands
generated from a single microwave drive, realized using by
two AWG channels and one IQ mixer, with equal amplitude
and frequency differences between the sidebands. The power
and frequency interval of the Ωf0g1 are calibrated to achieve
the maximum the damping effect on the state |n, f⟩sq. After
calibration, the damping time T|1,f⟩is approximately 2 µs. In
the experiment, we maintain a fixed amplitude of Ωf0g1 while
controlling the damping rate of the transmon qubit through the
amplitude of Ωef, as shown in the main text.
