Fig. 7: Spectral constraints on the stellar parameters of the narrow-lined stripped star. The panels show the disentangled spectrum
(black) compared to PoWR models with the best-fit parameters (Teff = 13.5, kK, log g = 2.25). The models differ in composition:
one assumes solar hydrogen, helium and metal abundances (Asplund et al. 2021), while our fiducial model (blue) is He- and N-
enriched, characteristic of a stripped star. The narrow H-Balmer absorption lines support a low surface gravity, while the stripped-star
model provides a better fit to the He and N absorption features. Metal lines not present in the model spectra (e.g., Si II 4153, 4163 Å)
were not included in the atomic line lists.

Fig. 8: Comparison of the disentangled spectrum of the Be com-
panion star (black) with that of the Be star HD 45871, which has
spectral type B3Ve (Levenhagen & Leister 2006). The reference
spectrum was obtained from the ESO archive. It was observed
by M. Borges Ferndandes with the FEROS Échelle spectrograph
at the MPG/2.2m telescope and can be found under the archive

machandran et al. 2024; Bodensteiner et al. 2020a). In the ab-
sence of other suitable absorption lines in the spectrum, we used
He I 4026 Å, 4144 Å, 4388 Å, and 4472 Å lines of the Be star to
estimate the rotational velocity. The method yields vrot sin i val-
ues in the range ∼250 to 425 km/s for the individual lines and
vrot sin i = 270 ± 70 km s−1 as the weighted mean and standard
deviation of the weighted mean. The fit results are illustrated
for the He I 4026 Å line in Appendix E. Helium lines, though af-
fected by pressure broadening, are commonly used for rotational
velocity estimates in massive stars (Dufton et al. 2013; Ramírez-
Agudelo et al. 2013). However, given the noise level and the
limited number of available lines, the uncertainties derived for
vrot sin i should be interpreted with caution.
In Fig. 9, the disentangled spectrum of the Be star is com-
pared to the model spectra with temperatures and surface gravi-
ties within the derived parameter ranges and a rotational velocity
vrot sin i = 270 km s−1. The models match the observations well,
except for the Balmer absorption line cores, which are strongly
affected by the variable emission, and support the initial classifi-
cation as a B3V star.
As discussed in Sect. 7, the system is probably observed
close to edge on, that is, it is unlikely that the value of sin i is sig-
nificantly less than one. With that in mind, the Be star’s rotational
velocity of vrot ≈270 km s−1 is relatively low, corresponding to
about 60% of the critical rotation velocity, vcrit = √
2GM∗/3R∗, as-
suming typical masses and radii for B-type main-sequence stars
(i.e., 5 M⊙, 3.5 R⊙). For Be stars, one would typically expect
vrot/vcrit ≥0.8 (Townsend et al. 2004). This is a first indica-
tor that the Be star is somewhat inflated - as also suggested by
its narrower Balmer lines - because this would reduce its criti-
cal rotation velocity. However, Townsend et al. (2004) note that
vrot sin i determined in this way may underestimate the true pro-
jected equatorial rotation velocity due to gravity darkening. On
the other hand, Zorec et al. (2016) shed doubt on the fact that Be
stars are near-critical rotators and instead found a wide range of
velocity ratios 0.3 ≲vrot/vcrit ≲0.95 among Be stars.
