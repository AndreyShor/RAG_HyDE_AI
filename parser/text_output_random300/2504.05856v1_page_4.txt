physically expected shapes, i.e. distinct two peaks and a rela-
tively smooth shape. In this step, we remove SNe mainly due
to relatively poor fit quality or partial coverage of the light
curves: 2006D, 2008hy, 2008O, 2020kqv, 2020krw, 2020mby,
2020mdd, 2020tfc, 2021glz. Additionally, SNe 2006le and
2009Y were removed only from the H-band light-curve anal-
ysis. SNe 2006X and 2020mvp are removed due to high host
extinction, as suggested by the high E(B −V)host values (1.357
and 0.792 mag, respectively) obtained with SNooPy fits to these
objects, using the EBV_model2 model. Particularly, SN 2006X
was already known to have high reddening (e.g. Wang et al.
2008; Folatelli et al. 2010). Another SN removed is 2020mbf.
This object shows relatively flat NIR light curves, even in the
J band, with a very shallow valley, which hints towards a 06bt-
like SN (Foley et al. 2010). The light curve and PISCOLA fit of
this SN can be found in Fig. A.1. SN 2008hs is also removed
given that this object presents a secondary NIR peak happening
at much earlier phase compared to the rest of the sample, hint-
ing towards a possible ‘transitional’ SN Ia (see Fig. A.1 as well).
Note, however, that this SN has not been classified as such and
even passes the color-stretch cut applied below. Additionally,
as PCA does not propagate uncertainties, we only select SNe
with relatively small photometric uncertainties (σm). We choose
those with σm < 0.2 mag across the entire phase range used (see
below). Although applying a lower uncertainty threshold grants
more precision, it also reduces the sample size, which is already
very limited.
We then use the color-stretch parameter, sBV3 (Burns et al.
2014), to remove the SNe falling outside the ‘normal ’expected
range, i.e. those with 0.6 ≤sBV ≤1.4. SNe 2007on, LSQ12fvl
and 2020uea do not pass this last cut, having lower values.
To summarise, from the initial sample of 160 SNe Ia, and af-
ter removing those with bad fits, peculiar shapes, relatively large
uncertainties and sBV outside the adopted range, only 47, 36 and
25 SNe remain for the YJH bands, respectively.
After these cuts, the NIR light curves are shifted in time to
match at the epoch of B-band maximum luminosity, as obtained
with SNooPy using the max_model model. We then select the
light-curve range between −8 and +34 days with respect to B-
band peak, for each band independently. This somewhat arbi-
trary range approximately covers the first NIR peak, which hap-
pens at ∼5 days before optical peak, and extends to the sec-
ondary peak, which occurs after 20 days (see Fig. 2; Dhawan
et al. 2015).
The last step of this process is to normalize the light curves
by the brightness at the time of B-band peak. This prevents the
global scale from dominating the sample variance and allows
the PCA decomposition to focus on other light-curve features
instead. Additionally, this removes the dependence on distance,
which is not normally known with high accuracy for these extra-
galactic transients.
Figure 2 shows the YJH-band light curves of SNe Ia after the
aforementioned prepossessing steps. In the case of the J and H
bands, around one third of the SNe come from CSP and one third
from the literature, while for the Y band, around 50% come from
CSP, one third from DEHVILS, and a small handful of objects
from the literature. In general, a similar trend is observed for
the YJH-band light curves, where the SNe with lower sBV values
have earlier secondary peak compared to those with higher val-
ues, following the same behavior described by Phillips (2012).
3 This parameters measures the stretch in the (B −V) color curve that
peaks around 30 days after optical maximum, combining the stretch and
color parameters into a single one.

Fig. 2: SNe Ia rest-frame light curves after the preprocessing
steps of Sect. 5.1. The phase range covers from −8 to +34 days
with respect to optical peak. The light curves are color-coded
by sBV value, obtained with SNooPy fits using the max_model
model, limiting the color range between 0.8 ≤sBV ≤1.2 for
visualisation purposes as the bulk of the sample falls within this
range.
Limitations and caveats: It is worth noting that the samples
used are very limited in numbers. Given the requirements, the
