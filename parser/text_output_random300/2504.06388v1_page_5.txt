Similarly, the scattering waves with outgoing (-) boundary conditions, associated
with the plane-wave emissions to the right (r) and the left (l), behave asymptotically
as:

As it is well-known, both the incoming basis {Ψ(r,+), Ψ(l,+)} and the outgoing basis
{Ψ(r,−), Ψ(l,−)} can be used to describe the continuous states of the scattering problem.

In the speciﬁc case of a square-well potential, the scattering wave functions can
be derived analytically [22]. For other potentials where the analytical scattering wave
functions are either challenging to obtain or do not exist, we introduce a plane-
wave basis using a procedure based on Ref. [23]. In Appendix A, we demonstrate
how to numerically calculate the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients for a given
short-range potential. Once the scattering states are established, the photoemission
probabilities can be retrieved within the SPM framework by projecting the time-
propagated wave function onto the incoming (+) or outgoing (-) basis, similar to the
