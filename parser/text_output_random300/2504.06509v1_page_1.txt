Abstract 
Achieving ultrafast and energy-efficient magnetization switching is essential for next-
generation spintronic devices. Voltage-driven switching offers a promising alternative to 
current-based approaches. Although voltage-controlled exchange coupling (VCEC) has been 
proposed to steer magnetic states, its ultrafast response and role in polarity selection have not 
been experimentally verified. Here, we demonstrate that VCEC induces a directional exchange 
field that persists under nanosecond voltage pulses in a perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction 
(pMTJ) with an exchange-coupled free layer. This confirms that VCEC can operate on ultrafast 
timescales and deterministically select the switching polarity. The reversal is primarily assisted 
by voltage-induced magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), which transiently lowers the energy barrier. 
This combination enables magnetization switching within 87.5 ps with 50% switching 
probability and 100 ps with 94% switching probability, respectively. The observed fast 
switching is enabled in part by enhanced angular momentum dissipation in the exchange-
coupled structure, which increases effective damping and accelerates relaxation. These 
findings reveal a purely voltage-driven and dynamically viable route for fast, directional 
control of magnetizationâ€”positioning VCEC as a key functional mechanism for future 
spintronic logic and memory technologies.
