Thus the Jacobi field matrix J(s) = DΦs(Φ−1
t (x)) satisfies,
d
dsJ(s) = S(s)J(s).
Therefore, by the first part of Lemma 5.3 and the uniqueness of solutions to such linear
differential equations, it follows that J(s) = exp+ S′′(s).
Moreover we find that,

for 0 < t < T provided △S is bounded below. We can now recover a familiar result
from the above on the asymptotic behaviour from the stochastic elementary formula
and the dominated convergence theorem.
Corollary 5.4.1. Given that the no-caustic condition holds with a caustic time T > 0
and that △S(x, t) is bounded below, then for t ∈[0, T),

This gives us the behaviour of uσ(x, t) for small σ up to first order in σ2.
As was mentioned in the Introduction, if we define,
Sσ(x, t) = −σ2 ln uσ(x, t),
then it is a simple exercise to prove that S(x, t) satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
equation,
