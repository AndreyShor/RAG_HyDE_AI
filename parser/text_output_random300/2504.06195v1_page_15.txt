Figures 8(a) and (b), corresponding to Ti–TM and Ti–TE datasets, respectively, reveal 
extremely tight clustering of residuals around zero, with minimal dispersion and no noticeable bias 
or systematic trend across the index range. This strongly supports the earlier findings of 
exceptionally low MSE in these configurations and reinforces that broadband, smooth intensity 
modulations in Ti-based spectra align well with linear PCA modeling. The residuals appear nearly 
uniform and homoscedastic, indicating high model fidelity throughout the entire sensing range. 
 
Figure 8. Residual plots from five-fold cross-validated full-spectrum linear regression. Titanium-based datasets (a, b) 
show minimal error, while silicon-based cases (c, d) exhibit larger, more scattered residuals. 
In contrast, Figures 8(c) and (d), associated with Si–TM and Si–TE datasets, show broader 
distributions of residuals, with Si–TE in particular displaying a visibly higher variance. This 
pattern is consistent with the elevated MSEs observed in Figure 7(a) and is attributed to the 
nonlinear intensity-shift behavior inherent to Mie-resonant metasurfaces. The increased variability
