The last term of Eq. (3) is treated with the Hartree-Fock mean-field (MF) approxi-

consistently. 
 
2.3 Green’s Function Formalism 
The spin-selective transmission probabilities are calculated using the well-known 
Green’s function formalism [2, 15]. We need to define two types of Green's functions 
as  
 
                                                     𝐺𝜎
𝑅= [𝐸𝕀−ℋ𝑐ℎ
𝑒𝑓𝑓−Σ𝑆−Σ𝐷]−1,             
 
                                                     𝐺𝜎
𝐴= (𝐺𝜎
𝑅)+             
(4) 
where  𝐺𝜎 
𝑅 and 𝐺𝜎
𝐴 are the retarded and advanced Green’s functions of the conductor, 
respectively. Σ𝑆/𝐷 is the contact self-energy for the source (drain), which is also 
renormalized due to the e-ph coupling. For detailed calculation of self-energy expres-
sions, see Ref. [2].  
The transmission probability is computed from the relation, 
                                                     𝑇𝜎(𝐸) = 𝑇𝑟 [Γ𝑆 𝐺𝜎
𝑅 Γ𝐷 𝐺𝜎
𝐴],             
(5) 
where Γ𝑆/𝐷= −2 𝐼𝑚 ( Σ𝑆/𝐷) is the broadening factor associated with the source 
(drain). Using the spin-dependent transmission probabilities, the spin polarization 
coefficient is evaluated as,  
                                                     𝑆𝑃=
𝑇↑−𝑇↓
𝑇↑+𝑇↓  × 100 (%)             
(6) 
where 𝑇↑ and 𝑇↓ are the transmission probabilities associated with up and down spin 
electrons, respectively. A maximum spin polarization is achieved when only one spin 
component transmits, while equal transmission of both spin components results in 
zero spin polarization.

Numerical Results and Discussion 
We now turn our attention to the results obtained numerically based on the above 
theoretical discussions. Before starting a detailed analysis, we first mention the values 
of some input parameters that are kept constant throughout the study. For the side-
attached leads, we choose 𝜖0 = 0, and 𝑡0 = 2. The conductor, a 30-site one-
dimensional chain with hopping strength t = 1, is connected to the source and drain at
