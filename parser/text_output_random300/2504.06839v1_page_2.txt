Introduction
The Lorentz Gas is the dynamical system describing the motion of a classical particle interacting through elastic
collisions with a system of obstacles. We will focus here on hard-core scatterers with spherical symmetry, and since
the obstacles are infinitely heavy they do not move. This model was first proposed by Lorentz [13] to describe the
motion of the electrons in a metal.
Let the spherical obstacles have centers c := {cj}j∈N in Rd and radius ε. Then, the motion of the particle is
described as follows. If no collisions occur, that is, as long as the distance between the particle and any obstacle is
larger than ε, the particle’s motion is free: given (x, v) ∈Rd × Rd such that |x −cj| > ε
∀j ∈N, and denoting by
(Xt, Vt) the position and velocity of the particle at time t, the dynamics is described by

X0(x, v; c) = x, ˙Xt(x, v; c) = Vt(x, v; c),
V0(x, v; c) = v, ˙Vt(x, v; c) = 0,
if |Xt(x, v; c) −cj| > ε
∀j ∈N,

but when the particle hits an obstacle it gets specularly reflected. That is, if the particle collides at time t with the
obstacle ¯j, then |Xt(x, v; c) −c¯j| = ε and
( Xt+(x, v; {cj}j) = Xt−(x, v; c),
Vt+(x, v; c) = R

where ft± denote respectively lims→t± f(s) and R[x]v is the orthogonal reflection of v with respect to the real line of
direction x, i.e. R[x]v = −vx + v⊥
x when v = vx + v⊥
x , vx ∈Rx, v⊥
x ∈(Rx)⊥.
The obstacles may overlap, that is, it could happen that, for j ̸= k ∈N, 0 < |cj −ck| ≤2ε. In this case, the
dynamics is not well defined only if the particles hits both the obstacles at the same time, i.e, if |Xt(x, v; c) −cj| =
|Xt(x, v; c)−ck| = ε, since the obstacles should reflect the velocity vector in two different directions. The points which
belong to the boundary of two different obstacles are usually referred as "angular points". This problem is overcome
by noticing that the Lebesgue measure of the set of initial data (x, v) such that the particle hits an angular point is
zero (see for example [2]).
Since |v| is preserved within the motion, it is assumed to be 1 with no loss of generality.
Therefore if one considers a particle with randomly distributed initial data (x, v) ∈Rd ×Sd−1, for example through
a density function µin(x, v), for finite ε > 0 the time evolution of the density is
µt(x, v; c) = µin(X−t(x, v; c), V−t(x, v; c)),
with Xt and Vt described in (1.0.1) and (1.0.2), and one may ask under what assumptions on c the quantity
limε→0 µt(x, v; c) exists and is non trivial. Typically, one should scale also the time t (i.e., dividing it by ε).
Here we are focusing on the low density case.
The case of low density and randomly Poisson distributed obstacles was first studied by Gallavotti [9]. The author
proved that if a point particle moves in R2 and the centers of the obstacles are a Poisson point process of intensity

where the expected value is taken with respect to the (Poisson) distribution of the obstacles’ centers c. Moreover the
limiting µt satisfies the Boltzmann equation

(1.0.4)
where R[θ]v is the rotation of v by angle π −θ, i.e., the same rotation R as before expressed as a function of the angle
of the impact.
The previous limit is the low-density (Boltzmann-Grad) limit, that is, one lets the size of the scatterer radius ε →0
but keeping constant the mean free path length. In the previous case the mean free path length is λ ∼(2nε)−1.
Spohn [21] strengthened the previous result by proving that the convergence of the Lorentz process
(Xt(x, v; c), Vt(x, v; c))
to a stochastic process holds with respect to the weak∗topology of regular Borel measures on the paths space, even
if more general random distributions of the obstacles are taken into account.
A further related result was obtained by Boldrighini-Bunimovich-Sinai [2]: the authors proved that the scaled
Lorentz process converges for almost all c configurations of the obstacles’ centers.
Then a natural question is what changes in (1.0.3) and in (1.0.4) if the obstacles’ centers have periodic configuration,
instead of being randomly distributed, and the expectation sign in (1.0.3) is transferred to the initial data. This model
is better known as periodic Lorentz Gas and it has been studied by several authors.
