For completeness, note that splitting functions carry a dependency on the number of active
flavors nf, and (∆)Pqg as well as (∆)Pqq,ps, (∆)Pns,s are fully proportional to nf. All the above
listed sum rules are valid at every order and for every nf component in perturbation theory.
The actual expressions of the splitting kernels can be obtained directly from the Feynman
diagrams of the quark-to-gluon and gluon-to-gluon splitting, although these kernels appear
also explicitly during the calculation of higher order QCD cross-sections as we have sketched in
Section 1.3.1. The unpolarized analytic Pij expressions are known up to NNLO [54, 55, 56],
while we will discuss explicitly the different N3LO approximations in Section 4.1. The NNLO
helicity dependent ∆Pij were presented in Refs. [57, 58] and benchmarked independently in
Refs. [56, 59].
DGLAP solution.
Having simplified the system of the DGLAP equations with respect to the
flavor space, we can now attempt to solve it. However, we see that Eq. (1.60) contains
a convolution which makes the differential equations more complicated. Therefore, it is
convenient to introduce the Mellin transformation:
˜g(N) = M [g(x)] (N) =
Z 1
0
dx x(N−1)g(x) .
(1.72)
In Mellin space a convolution becomes a simple product
M [c ⊗f] (N) =

u u(N−1)t(N−1)c(t)f(u) = ˜c(N) ˜f(N) ,
(1.73)
thus we can define the anomalous dimension (note the additional minus sign) as
γij (N, as) = −M [Pij(x, as)] (N) ,
