the positivity is obvious. The above argument, combined with the Schur product theorem [117] for the Hadamard product in
(B.4) then implies that the sesqulinear form ⟨ϕ(x)| ˆOϕ|ϕ(y)⟩is positive definite for ∆ϕ ≥∆O/2. Given the discussion above
(B.2), we expect this positivity to persist for more general ∆ϕ consistent with unitarity, though the sesqulinear forms in (B.5)
may not be separately positive.
Kato’s (second) representation theorem [113, 114, 116] states that a densely defined closed Hermitian form is uniquely rep-
resented by a self-adjoint operator. The Hermitian forms and quadratic forms are clearly in one-to-one correspondence. The
closeness condition amounts to requiring the corresponding quadratic form q(·) to satisfy lower semicontinuity, namely, for any
convergent sequence (fn) [118],
lim
n→∞||fn −f|| = 0 ⇒q(f) ≤lim
n→∞inf q(fn) .
(B.11)
Since the form defined by (B.4) and (B.5) is closed by construction and positive, by Kato’s theorem, we confirm the existence
of the unique self-adjoint operator ˆOϕ whose domain is dense in Hϕ and whose matrix elements coincide with the form as in
(B.3).
Now let us consider the case where two conformal families {ϕ1,2} are involved in the definition of the form (B.2). The
generalization to cases involving more conformal families can be done analogously. For this purpose it suffices to consider the
following state |ϕf⟩≡c1|ϕ1(x)⟩+ c2|ϕ2(y)⟩. The corresponding sesquilinear form reads,
(ϕf, ϕf) = c11O |c1|2 ⟨ϕ1(x)| ˆOϕ1|ϕ1(x)⟩+ c22O |c2|2 ⟨ϕ2(y)| ˆOϕ2|ϕ2(y)⟩

(B.12)
Since the above can be written as a sum of semi-bounded closed quadratic forms and each can be represented by a unique self-
adjoint operator by Kato’s theorem, we have identified the self-adjoint operator ˆO∆acting on two conformal families. Now this
approach can be extended to H∆which contains a finite number of conformal families.
Appendix C: Establishing the trivial representation
Given a Gelfand triple ΦD ⊂H ⊂Φ′
D associated with the CFT Hilbert space H, and let |⃗x⟩∈Φ′
D be elements obeying the
following actions of the conformal subalgebra,
Pi|⃗x⟩= i∂i |⃗x⟩,
D|⃗x⟩= xi∂i |⃗x⟩,
Ki|⃗x⟩= i(2xixj∂j −xjxj∂i) |⃗x⟩,

for an orthonormal basis of primary operators ϕa(x), are linear combinations of Ishibashi states. In particular, the coefficient
function fa(⃗x, y) is only nonzero if ϕa is a scalar primary, in which case, up to an overall constant,
fa(⃗x, y) = y∆a−d

(C.3)
Without loss of generality, we can focus on a single primary operator ϕa in (C.2) and thus will drop the subscript a below. We
present the details below for scalar ϕa only as the case of spinning operators is very analogous.
From the action of Pi in (C.1) and (C.2), we have
