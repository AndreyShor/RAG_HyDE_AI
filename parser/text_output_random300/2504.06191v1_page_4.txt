The opacities can be represented as short wavelength UV or r process functions and long 
wavelength IR or s process functions where the wavelength dependence is critical for separating 
out the r and s processes for each term in the opacity expression: one for bound state to bound 
state electrons, bb, one for bound to free electron photoionization, bf, one for free-to-free 
electron Bremsstrahlung, ff, and the final term for electron scattering, es:

where a and b are the MvdW EoS parameters. Each of these terms depends upon the EoS being 
used through the material density for each opacity term as

where we use the photoionization free-free Gaunt-Kramers [70] astrophysical factor of gff = 1.1, 
and the oscillator strengths, fij, are from the NIST database [71, 72], and φij is the transition line 
shape for frequency νij. For the MvdW EoS the density function can be solved directly in terms 
of temperature and pressure. The MvdW EoS, has a partition function expressed as:

where Λi is the thermal deBroglie wavelength and the aij represent the interparticle interaction 
strength, which is symmetric, aij=aji, and aii=ai and kij is the standard mixing parameter between 
ai and aj and the bj represent the excluded volume factors and the aij strength is determined by the 
QCD color factor for the representation of SU(3)c being considered, where the effective qiqjδij 
quark interaction is attractive and repulsive [73]. This gives the MvdW EoS as
