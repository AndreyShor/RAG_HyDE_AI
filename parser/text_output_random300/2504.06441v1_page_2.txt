2. It is possible to consider a subregion as closed for a
suﬃciently small time interval. The time evolution
of the density matrix of the subregion in such an
interval of time is
∂
∂t ˆρi = i
¯h[ˆρi, ˆHi],
(2)
where ˆHi is the Hamiltonian of the quasi closed
subregion i.
3. After a suﬃciently long period of time the space-
time reaches the state of statistical equilibrium in
which the density matrices of the subregions must
be stationary. We must then have
[
Y
i
ˆρi, ˆH] = 0,
(3)
where ˆH is the Hamiltonian of the closed macro-
scopic spacetime. This condition is certainly satis-
ﬁed if
[ˆρi, ˆH] = 0,
(4)
for all i.
We then ﬁnd that the logarithm of the density matrix
of a subregion is an additive integral of motion of the
spacetime.
This is certainly satisﬁed if
ln ˆρi = αi + βi ˆHi.
(5)
In the time interval in which the subregion can be con-
sidered closed it is possible to diagonalize simultaneously
ˆρi and ˆHi. We then ﬁnd
ln ρ(i)
n = αi + βiE(i)
n ,
(6)
where the probabilities ρ(i)
n = w(E(i)
n ) represent the dis-
tribution function in statistical gravity.
If we consider the closed spacetime as composed
of many subregions and we neglect the “interactions”
among them, each state of the entire spacetime can be
described specifying the state of the various subregions.
Then the number dΓ of quantum states of the closed
spacetime corresponding to an inﬁnitesimal interval of
his energy must be the product
dΓ =
Y
i
dΓi,
(7)
of the numbers dΓi of the quantum states of the various
subregions.
In fact we will have an uncertainty principle [10, 11]
ruling the two conjugated variables that are the general-
ized ‘coordinate’: The metric tensor ﬁeld gµν(x) where
x is an event of spacetime and the generalized ‘momen-
tum’: The operator ˆπµν = −i¯hδ/δgµν. As usual we will
have
∆gµν(x)∆ˆπαβ(x′) ≥1
2|⟨[gµν(x), ˆπαβ(x′)]⟩|
= 1
2¯hδ(4)(x −x′)δα
µδβ
ν ,
(8)
where ⟨. . .⟩denotes a vacuum expectation value, ∆indi-
cates a standard deviation, δ(4) is a Dirac delta function
in 4 dimensions, and the other two δ are Kronecker sym-
bols.
2 Here we are associating gµν(x) with the metric
tensor from General Relativity entering our Eq. (27). A
delicate point is that of a consistent description of the
vacuum of General Relativity where both matter ﬁelds
and the Ricci scalar vanish for which our high tempera-
ture density matrix of Eq. (27) reduces to a functional
Dirac delta.
We can then formulate the expression for the micro-
canonical distribution function writing
dw ∝δ(E −E0)
Y
i
dΓi
(9)
for the probability to ﬁnd the closed spacetime in any of
the states dΓ.
Let us consider a spacetime that is closed for a pe-
riod of time that is long relative to its relaxation time.
This implies that the spacetime is in complete statistical
equilibrium.
Let us divide the spacetime region in a large number
of macroscopic parts and consider one of these. Let ρn =
w(En) be the distribution function for such part. In order
to obtain the probability W(E)dE that the subregion
has an energy between E and E + dE we must multiply
w(E) by the number of quantum states with energies in
this interval. Let us call Γ(E) the number of quantum
states with energies less or equal to E. Then the required
number of quantum states with energy between E and
E + dE is
dΓ(E)
dE
dE,
(10)
and the energy probability distribution is
W(E) = dΓ(E)
dE
w(E),
(11)
with the normalization condition
Z
W(E)dE = 1.

2 It has been pointed out by prof. John R. Klauder that in the
Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner [12] 3 + 1 foliation scheme, that
seems to be necessary to treat the path integral described in
Section III, where the imaginary time naturally splits from the
space, the generalized ‘coordinate’ is played by the spatial com-
ponents of the metric tensor ﬁeld. But these subtensor must be
positive deﬁnite. So that due to this anholonomous constraint
the corresponding generalized ‘momentum’ would cease to be a
self-adjoint operator. In order to put things back in order the
most elegant way is to use Aﬃne Quentization that amounts to
deﬁne a diﬀerent generalized momentum, the so called dilation
operator ˆπb
a = gacˆπcb, where we indicate with a latin index a
spatial component. So doing the dilation operator is made self-
adjoint by construction.
