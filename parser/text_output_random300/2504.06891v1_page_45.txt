we considered are sampled from an ion microﬁeld distribution deduced a from self-consistent
approach for astrophysical and laboratory plasmas (SCAALP) calculations141;142;143;144.
The free-free component of the spectral opacity is computed from the free-free component of the
real part of the frequency-dependent electrical conductivity deduced from the Kubo-Greenwood
approach145. In the present work, a hydrogenic Gaunt factor122 is used to account for quantum
corrections at high frequency. Such a correction is here justiﬁed, as the plasmas are essentially
non-degenerate along the considered thermodynamical paths.
OPLIB/ATOMIC computations
The Los Alamos OPLIB opacity database has been publicly available for more than forty
years, and is currently accessible at the website1. The website can produce monochromatic,
multigroup and gray opacities for either pure elements or arbitrary mixtures. The most re-
cent database release34, which is the version considered in the present work, was generated
with the ATOMIC code. ATOMIC is a multi-purpose plasma modeling code146;147;148 that can
be run in local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (LTE) or non-LTE mode to calculate the atomic-
level populations. These populations are calculated using the occupation-probability formal-
ism within the ChemEOS equation-of-state model to smoothly dissolve atomic states into the
continuum149;147;150. The fundamental atomic data, such as wavefunctions and level energies,
are calculated with the semi-relativistic Hartree-Fock method151;116 in the Los Alamos suite of
atomic physics codes148.
The resulting line (bound-bound) contributions to the opacities are calculated in ﬁne-structure
detail. Line broadening for H- and He-like ion stages includes the Stark treatment of Lee
(1988)152, while electron collisional broadening153 is used for ion stages with three or more
bound electrons. The photoionization cross sections that are used in the bound-free contri-
