(overlapping with cation deformation modes) was located at 1120 cm-1. The strong Raman band 
at 974 cm-1 (medium-intensity IR band at 979 cm-1) corresponds to symmetric stretching 1SO4 
vibration. The manifestations of originally triply degenerate 4SO4 vibrations (partially 
overlapping with rg mode) were recorded in the 645-590 cm-1 region. Two bands present in 
both spectra at 446 and 434 cm-1 (partially overlapping with CNC mode) belong to originally 
doubly degenerate 2SO4 vibrations. 
 
3.4. UV-Vis-NIR spectrum of 2-AmpH2PO3 
The spectrum in Fig. 12 represents the UV-Vis-NIR absorption of the 2-AmpH2PO3 single-
crystal plate. The spectrum shows the excellent optical transparency of this polar crystal from 
the NIR region to the edge of the UV region (down to at least 370 nm). 
 
3.5. Solid-state computation results for 2-AmpH2PO3 
To find a suitable computational method for modelling the spectral and optical properties of 
crystalline 2-AmpH2PO3, we first carried out a detailed comparison of the calculated 
vibrational bands with the recorded Raman and IR spectra. The presented graphical 
comparisons (Figs. S11 and S12, Supplementary material) confirm the considerable influence 
of the computational method on the agreement of the calculated band positions and intensities 
with the experimental results.  
The comparison of the calculated modes and recorded Raman spectra (see Fig. S11, 
Supplementary material) shows mainly differences in the intensities of the lattice modes and 
the positions and/or intensities of the bands of stretching vibrations of the C-H, N-H and O-H 
groups. The results obtained by the “B3LYP” method exhibit an overestimation of the lattice 
modes intensities and an overestimation of the positions of stretching modes of the O-H and N-
H groups involved in the O-H…O and N-H…O hydrogen bonds (2800-2600 cm-1 region). The 
results obtained by the “B3LYP-advanced” method exhibit an overestimation of the intensities 
of stretching modes of the C-H, N-H, O-H and P-H groups (3300-2400 cm-1 region) and also 
an overestimation of the positions of stretching modes of the O-H and N-H groups involved in 
the O-H…O and N-H…O hydrogen bonds (2800-2600 cm-1 region). On the other hand, this 
method generally provides the best match for the Raman spectrum in the fingerprint region (see 
Fig. S11, Supplementary material). The results of the “PBESOL0” method are characterized by 
the excellent agreement obtained for the positions of the stretching modes of the C-H, N-H, O-
H and P-H groups (3300-2400 cm-1 region) and an overestimation of lattice modes intensities.
