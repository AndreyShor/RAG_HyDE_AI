Fig.2 Comparison of Pearson correlation Coefficient obtained on S461 dataset between the original 
method (pink bar) and its adjusted version with Mass-Balance Correction, using bothMBC(dd) (green 
bar) and Rose scale (blue bar). ddMMBC_only represents the prediction made using only the fitted 
mutation coefficients without incorporating a method.  *KD25 and *Rose26  and are the scale difference 
values without any fitting. 
 
Generalization of the Mass-Balance Correction Across Different Methods 
 
Reeves and Kalyaanamoorthy30 recently highlighted that structure-based and 
sequence-based PLMs can be linearly combined to improve the performance, 
indicating that these two methodological classes provide complementary information. 
They further noted that “...PSLMs can be reliably augmented with physicochemical 
properties to exceed the median performance of the benchmark stability predictor..”. 
This aligns with our model, since 
 
𝛥𝛥𝐺= (𝐺𝐹(𝑚) −𝐺𝐹(𝑤)) −(𝐺𝑈(𝑚) −𝐺𝑈(𝑤)) = 𝛥𝛥𝐻𝐹−𝑇𝛥𝛥𝑆𝐹

Thus, it is reasonable to think that both sequence and structure-based terms 
correspond to the ΔΔG term for the unfolded and folded states, respectively.  
Additionally, the molecular volume and the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) 
play a crucial role in estimating the solvation energy changes (a large part of ΔΔS𝐹) 
when a molecule interacts with a solvent. This concept has been widely applied in 
different implicit solvation models, such as the GBSA family of models31,32.  
From this perspective, the MBC can be seen as a proxy of this information. Our 
model provides a simple, yet effective, way to estimate the Gibbs free energy 
difference between wild-type and mutated proteins in their unfolded states.
