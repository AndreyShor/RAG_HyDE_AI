Figure S2: Dependence ofthe signallinewidths onthe catalystconcentrations. Zero-fieldspectra
of naturally abundant [15N]-ACN / [14N]-ACN samples (0.36 % / 99.6 %) with catalyst concentra-
tions of 5 mM (orange) and 10 mM (blue). The co-ligand (benzylamine) to catalyst concentration
ratio was 25 for both samples. Dashed lines represent dual Lorentzian fits, from which the full-
width-at-half-maximum of the corresponding peaks was extracted.

Figure S3: Visualization of ˆ𝜌eq at zero-field. The parameters 𝛼and 𝛽(with coefficients) denote
the offsets of populations with respect to the thermal state at zero-field. The states with the same
total proton angular momentum 𝐾and total angular momentum 𝐹have identical populations.
