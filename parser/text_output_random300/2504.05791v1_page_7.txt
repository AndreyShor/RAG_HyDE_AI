cm per size step and 2° per taper angle step), the illusion space for
angle perception is bigger than for size. Both illustrations (Fig.3 and
Fig.4) show the perceptual interplay between size and taper angle,
with non-uniform distributions of proportions across the factors.
Specially, the virtual size seems to have a significant influence on
the angle perception. As shown in Fig. 4, the perceived illusion of
angle expands greatly as virtual object sizes increase. Interestingly,
participants sometimes held objects with identical virtual and phys-
ical angles but they wouldn’t perceive this was the case when the
virtual size was smaller than the physical objects.

Perception Thresholds with Single Property
Incongruence of Size and Taper Angle
We first present the individual results for sizes and taper angles
as single-dimensional analysis (either only the virtual size or only
the virtual angle changes). The proportions of answers have been
processed similarly to previous studies based on the answers of
2AFC questions [6, 16]. For the size perception, the percentage of
selecting “virtual smaller” is calculated for each different virtual
size combination while the other property of the virtual objects,
the taper angle, is congruent with that of the physical objects (i.e.,
the same as the physical objects). The same approach is applied to
taper angle perception, with the virtual size being congruent with
the physical objects’ size. The data points are fitted to the sigmoid
function:
𝑓(𝑥) =
1
1 + 𝑒𝑎𝑥+𝑏
(2)
For the size perception, the point at which there is a 50% chance
of selecting “virtual smaller” is considered the Point of Subjective
Equality (PSE); where the virtual object is estimated to be the same
size as the physical object (e.g. the participants randomly select
from ’smaller’ or ’larger’, as they perceive the objects to be the
same size). The 25% and 75% points, which are used to describe the
perception limits in similar psychological studies (e.g., [6, 16, 41]),
are correspondingly selected as the upscaling thresholds (UT) and
downscaling thresholds (DT) of perception, where the participants
become able to accurately determine differences between the phys-
ical and virtual objects with 75% certainty. The Just-Noticable Dif-
ference (JND) is defined as the distance between the upscaling or
downscaling threshold and the PSE. We can also obtain the We-
ber fraction, reflecting how sensitive users are to changes in the
sensory stimulus by calculating the ratio of JND to the reference
physical size. The same approach is also applied to the taper angle
perception results based on percentages of selecting “virtual less
tilted” (except grasping tasks with the 6cm-0° physical object, which
is analysed separately because of its unique taper orientation).
The size perception results of the five physical objects are shown
in Fig. 5. These figures demonstrate the range of virtual objects that
