6. Two additions are needed to complete the sum over a and to evaluate P3
a=1[Y α

x=0 cx,la(¯rζ
l |k|)2x,
with cost 2b.
7. Unlike [29], we seek to prepare a state directly approximating the quantity Gζ,l
α , rather than an upper
bound to it. Unfortunately, this requires multiplying by |kp2|l for the nonlocal term. We have already
prepared this for l = 2 in Step 1, but we have not prepared |kp2| in the case where l = 1. We compute
this from the register containing |kp2|2 using a controlled square-root circuit from [104]. However,
we make two adjustments: we substitute more efficient (i.e. Gidney [105]) base adders, and we count
resources in Toffolis rather than Ts. Specifically for b-bit input, the algorithm in [104] has three parts:
(i) an “initial subtraction” consisting of one adder with cost b; a “conditional addition” that consists
of additions of 2(j + 1)-bit addends for j = 2 . . . b
2 −1; a “remainder restoration” that uses a single
controlled addition with cost 2b. The total cost is therefore 3b + P b
2 −1
j=2 2(j + 1) = b2
4 + 7b
2 −6.
8. Multiplication by the prefactor |kp2|l requires a single controlled multiplication.
The cost of the
control is linear in b, which we omit. The primary contribution has cost b2. This completes the state
preparation for the polynomial part of ¯Gζ,l
α in Eq. (228).
9. For the local term, we must construct (¯rζ
loc)s|kp2|s from (¯rζ
loc)2|kp2|2.
Controlled on ς = 1 and
s ̸= 2, we square-root this register out-of-place with cost given in Step 7. We then multiply (¯rζ
loc)|kp2|
with (¯rζ
loc)2|kp2|2 in the case where s = 3, using a single multiplication with leading-order cost b2.
For the s = −1 part, rather than compute the reciprocal we instead multiply the alternate side of the
inequality test for rejection sampling by (¯rζ
loc)|kp2| (i.e. we carry out a single multiplication conditioned
on whether both φ = 1 and s = 1). The total cost for this step is therefore 5b2
4 + 7b
2 −6. This completes
the state preparation for the polynomial part of ¯Gζ
s in Eqs. (229) and (230).
10. For the non-local term, we must check whether |k(j)
p2 | = | P
α pαb(j)
α | ≤k∗
l , for all j (where here, bα
is the αth reciprocal lattice vector). Likewise for the local term, we must check the same condition
against the precomputed coefficient k∗
s. The coefficients k∗
l and k∗
s are precomputed and loaded using
the QROM in Sec. E.5.2. Evaluating |k(j)
p2 | requires three multiplications of an nj-bit component with
a b-bit classical multiplicand (plus two additions). The cost for each multiplication is
n2
j
2 + bnj. The
total cost of evaluating |k(j)
p2 | is therefore 1
2 ˜n + bn + 2b. This must be carried out three times (one for
each j), plus the cost of three inequality tests. The total cost is 3
2 ˜n + 3bn + 9b.
11. Dependent on both ς and the outcomes of the inequality tests in the previous step, we must multiply
by an l- or s-dependent constant. Both of these families of coefficients are assumed to be precomputed
classically and loaded using the QROM in Sec. E.5.2. In the worst case this step requires two controlled
multiplications. Including the controls introduces a complexity linear in b, which we omit. The cost
for this step is then 2b2.
12. We must evaluate γ∥kp2∥1 = P
j |k(j)
p2 |. Each of these components have already been computed; the
cost of this step is therefore the cost of two additions: 2b.
13. If the flag in Step 9 indicates that the criterion is not satisfied ∀j, we must modify the argument
to the exponential such that we evaluate γ∥kp2∥1 −(¯rζ
l |kp2|)2/2 rather than −(¯rζ
l |kp2|)2/2 for the
nonlocal term (and likewise γ∥kp2∥1 −(¯rζ
loc|kp2|)2/4 rather than −(¯rζ
loc|kp2|)2/4 for the local term).
This requires a single controlled subtraction with cost 2b.
14. The preparation of the exponential part in all cases is achieved with QROM interpolation as described
in [29], Sec. VI C. We assume the pessimistic cost derived there of 11
4 b2 + 128.
15. Multiplication of the exponential and polynomial parts to yield ¯Gζ,l
α and ¯Gζ
s has cost b2.
The reference function ˜G is guaranteed to upper bound |G|, not just G, and the rejection sampling (in
both success probability and circuit compilation) assumes that one is comparing ˜G with |G| (and that the
appropriate phases are added after the rejection sampling procedure). Given that |Gζ,l
α ⟩is stored as a signed
