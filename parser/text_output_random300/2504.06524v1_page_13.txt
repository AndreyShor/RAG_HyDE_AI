As shown in Ref. [45], the winding number can be further simpliﬁed to:
N eﬀ
1D = 1
2
X
s=↑,↓
X
C(kx)=0
sgn[∂kxC(kx)]sgn[R(kx)],
R(kx) = Re[qs(kx)],
C(kx) = Im[qs(kx)],
(54)
where the summation P
C(kx)=0 is taken for kx satisfying C(kx) = 0. Using this formula, we eventually obtain
N eﬀ
1D = 1

X
s=↑,↓
nc
X
n=−nc
sgn[vn]sgn[mn] = Nc,

which is also shown in the main text.
