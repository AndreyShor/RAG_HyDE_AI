• for z = p we can introduce the Hermitian operator:
ˆτ =
p
X
m=0
τm |τm⟩⟨τm|
(5)
where the time states |τm⟩provide an orthonormal
and complete basis in H. The operator (5) can be
considered as conjugated (or complement) to the
Hamiltonian ˆH: it is indeed easy to show that ˆH is
the generator of shifts in τm values and, viceversa,
ˆτ is the generator of energy shifts [18];
• for z > p the number of time states is greater
than the number of energy states and the time ob-
servable is represented by a POVM with z + 1 el-
ements
p+1
z+1 |τm⟩⟨τm|.
The resolution of identity
p+1
z+1
Pz
m=0 |τm⟩⟨τm| = 1 is indeed still satisﬁed
even if the time states are not orthogonal;
• in the limiting case z →∞is possible to redeﬁne
the time states as
|t⟩=
1
√p + 1
p
X
n=0
e−iℏ−1Ent |En⟩
(6)
where t is a continuous variable taking all the real
values in the interval [t0, t0 + T ]. The time observ-
able is again described by a POVM generated with
the operators p+1
T
|t⟩⟨t| dt and the resolution of the
identity reads here p+1
T
R
|t⟩⟨t| dt = 1.
In the ﬁrst two cases the time values of the clock are
discrete and we can search the fundamental limit in the
spacing between them. We will than see that such limit
reduces to zero in the case of z →∞, allowing us to safely
consider the time values as continuous in this limiting
case.
Finally, we will derive a bound on the minimal
resolvable interval in the clock time values.
B.
Limit in discretizing time
We proceed here in our analysis by considering z ≥p
and we will study z = p as a special case.
From (2)
and (4) we can easily calculate the spacing between two
neighbors time eigenvalues:
δτ = τm+1 −τm =
2πℏ
δE (z + 1)
(7)
where δE = 2πℏ
T
is the intervall between two neighbors
energy levels. We notice that no lower bounds exist for
δE, since T can be taken arbitrarily large. The same does
not hold for δτ for which can indeed be found a funda-
mental lower limit. The extent of the energy spectrum of
the clock is δE (p + 1) and it can be bound considering
that energy can not be arbitrarily conﬁned in a region of
space. Assuming the clock to be spherically symmetric,
we thus require that (half) the diameter of the clock lC
be not be smaller than its Schwarzschild radius [3, 4, 8].
Considering Emax as the larger energy eigenvalue, we ask:
Emax ≤δE (p + 1) < lC
2
c4
2G
(8)
which leads to
δE(z + 1) < lCc4
4G
(z + 1)
(p + 1)
(9)
and ﬁnally to
δτlC > 8π (p + 1)
(z + 1)lptp
(10)
where we have introduced the Planck length and the
Planck time as lp =
p
ℏG/c3 and tp =
p
ℏG/c5.
In the case z = p, where the time states are orthogonal
and we can introduce the Hermitian operator ˆτ, equation
(10) becomes
δτz=plC > 8πlptp
(11)
which imposes a bound in the minimum spacing between
time values depending on the physical size of the clock.
If instead we take z > p, we can obtain an arbitrarily
small bound for δτ by taking z arbitrarily large. Fur-
thermore, under the condition 2πℏ
δE = T > 8π(p + 1) lptp
lC
(which is easily satisﬁed), equations (10) and (7) ensure
that we can safely take the limit z →∞in which time
becomes continuous. Indeed, while δτ tends to zero, also
the constraint on δτ tends to zero (with the same scaling)
and δt always remains above the bound.
C.
Limit in resolving time
We work here in the limit z →∞, where the time
states are deﬁned as in (6) and the continuous variable t
takes all the real values in the interval [t0, t0 + T ]. The
eigenvalues of the clock Hamiltonian ˆH does not change
and they are again described by (2). Our goal is to iden-
tify a fundamental limit for the minimal resolvable inter-
val between time values when relativistic considerations
are taken into account. In a truly relativistic framework
the concept of time is closely connected with the concept
of space. The basic measurement in General Relativity
is indeed the measurement of distances between events
in spacetime.
Such measurements make the deﬁnition
of a coordinate system possible. For this reason, in de-
riving the bound for the temporal accuracy, we consider
the SW framework in which clocks and light signals are
used to measure spacetime distances [13, 14]. In some
sense, we are doing the opposite of what SW did: we are
not looking for quantum limitations to General Relativ-
ity, but instead we are searching the limitations that a
relativistic framework imposes on quantum theory.
The distances between events in spacetime could be
measured using clocks and rods but, as Wigner observes,
