can be reduced to the sum of occupied bandwidths, known as the
Landau rate. Mishali et al. [5] extended this concept to blind sam-
pling, where the occupied locations are unknown, showing that
universal sub-Nyquist sampling is feasible. They proved that the
overall sampling rate can be reduced to twice the Landau rate by CS
techniques, enabling low-cost blind wideband signal sniffing. The
relationship between Nyquist rate 𝐵, non-blind sub-Nyquist Landau
rate Σ, and blind sub-Nyquist rate 2Σ is illustrated in Figure 2.
CS [50] practically facilitates sparse signal recovery at sub-Nyquist
rates. Formally, let 𝑋∈C𝐿×𝑁denote the signal to be sampled, and
𝐴∈C𝑃×𝐿be the 𝑃measurement vectors, where 𝑃≪𝐿. The CS
process can be expressed as
𝑌= 𝐴𝑋+ 𝑛,
(1)
where 𝑌represents the measurement results and 𝑛is the noise.
When 𝑋is row-sparse, meaning that only a few rows are non-zero,
and the measurement matrix 𝐴satisfies the Restricted Isometric
Property (RIP), 𝑋can be uniquely and accurately recovered by Eq. 2,
where ∥∗∥𝑘represents 𝑘-norm and 𝜖represents the noise threshold.

Several studies [5, 7, 8, 48] have proposed low cost sub-Nyquist
sampling methods to formulate sampling and recovery into stan-
dard CS problems. The measurement matrix 𝐴and measurement
result 𝑌are determined by specific sampling schemes. The recov-
ery target 𝑋typically represents the signal spectrum, where each
row of 𝑋corresponds to the spectrum of a sub-band. While these
methods perform well under sparse spectrum conditions, their effec-
tiveness diminishes significantly for non-sparse spectra that exceed
the blind sub-Nyquist sampling capacity, leading to pronounced
performance degradation. Figure 3 demonstrates the CS recovery
performance. We randomly generate DVB-S2 signals and Wi-Fi
signals in a 1GHz spectrum. We recover 𝑋by a classic algorithm
SOMP [58]. With sufficient sampling rate, as shown in Figure 3b,
CS algorithm basically recovers the signals. But under non-sparse
scenario shown in Figure 3c, i.e., when the sampling rate is below
the theoretical limit, the CS algorithm fails to recover the signal
and cannot even correctly predict the spectrum occupancy.
Despite degradation of existing methods near twice the Lan-
dau rate, we argue that this bound can be reduced. Recall that
in non-blind recovery, i.e., where spectrum occupancy is known,
the sampling limit is just one time the Landau rate. Instead of
abrupt direct recovery, there should be a smoother path to blind

recovery that passes through non-blind recovery: spectrum sensing
first, then non-blind recovery. The effective bound becomes the
maximum of the Landau rate and the rate required for spectrum
sensing. If accurate spectrum sensing is feasible below twice the
Landau rate, we can break the blind recovery bound. To realize
this approach, deep learning [59–63] offers a promising avenue to
for uncovering hidden structures in signals [12–14, 43, 64, 65]. For
example, Zhang et al. [43] show that deep learning requires less
sampling resource for spectrum sensing. Follow the discussions
above, SigChord uses deep learning for spectrum sensing to enable
subsequent non-sparse recovery.

Headers of Physical Layer Signals
In physical layer protocols, payloads are often scrambled with
user-specific pseudo-random sequences for security, while head-
ers remain accessible, carrying critical metadata. For example, the
DVB-S2 protocol used for satellite communications encodes the
modulation and coding scheme (MCS), packet length, and pilot
state into 7 bits, which are bi-orthogonally expanded into 64 bits,
scrambled by predefined sequence and appended to a fixed SOF
preamble. Similarly, IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi signals encode MCS and
packet length into 24 bits for non-HT packets, and 48 bits for HT
packets which include additional parameters such as transmission
duration and bandwidth. These bits are convolutionally encoded
into 48 bits (non-HT) or 96 bits (HT) across the L-SIG and HT-SIG1
fields, scrambled and appended to fixed L-STF and L-LTF preambles.
The scrambling sequences and encoding schemes are open to the
public, so it is feasible to recover the headers. The detailed fields
are listed in Table 1.
A blind sniffer operates non-cooperatively without prior proto-
col knowledge. To detect physical layer packets, traditional methods
involve enumerating preambles to identify potential headers, yield-
ing low detection accuracy [66]. Additionally, subsequent signal
processing requires various synchronization, compensation, equal-
ization, demodulation, and decoding algorithms for each protocol,
significantly increasing system complexity. To address these, after
signal recovery, SigChord employs end-to-end neural networks
for signal classification and processing, including synchronization,
compensation, equalization, demodulation and decoding, enabling
accurate sniffing and simplified system designs.
