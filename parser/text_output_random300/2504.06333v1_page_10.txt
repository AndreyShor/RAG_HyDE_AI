Extending the SymTFT:
An illustration is shown in Figure 1.
The starting point is a 2D theory with
anomalous symmetry D. In the SymTFT picture, this is a conventional sandwich
construction for the Drinfeld center Z[D] with a physical boundary and a sym-
metry boundary. The anomaly resolution is realized by enriching the symmetry
boundary, so that the construction is equivalent to the club sandwich conﬁgura-
tion [9], with another 3D TFT labeled by the Drinfeld center Z[C]. The leftmost
symmetry boundary Bsym is speciﬁed by the Lagrangian algebra corresponding to
the non-anomalous C symmetry in 2D, for which we denote as Bsym = LC. The
topological interface I between the two 3D TFTs is speciﬁed by a condensable
algebra of Z[C], so that gauging/condensing this algebra, the 3D TFT Z[C] is
reduced to the TFT Z[D]. Given that the physical boundary is not necessar-
ily topological, and the D symmetry is anomalous, the resulting 2D theory after
resolution can be regarded as an C-symmetric igSPT phase [10].

Figure 1: Extend the symmetry boundary of the SymTFT for an anomalous sym-
metry C to the SymTFT for a non-anomalous one D.
There are some topological interface conditions deﬁned on I, which prevents
some of topological line operators in Z[C] from going into the reduced theory Z[D].
This means that for some topological line defects generating the C symmetry, some
of their charged defects are missing in the D theory (see Figure 2). This recovers
the trivially acting part in the C symmetry via extending from D.
Decomposition after gauging the resolved symmetry.
After the anomaly
resolution, one can then gauge the C symmetry by changing the Bsym = LC into
the one associated with the magnetic dual Lagrangian algebra. Denote the dual
category as C′, we can then label the new symmetry boundary as B′sym = LC′. Under
