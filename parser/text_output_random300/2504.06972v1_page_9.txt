The RIQAH states, FQAH states and superconductivity exhibit subtle competitions 
within the first moiré Chern band in tMoTe2. For νh < 2/3, the RIQAH solid at νh ≈ 0.63 
competes with the νh = 2/3 FQAH liquid, resembling the physics of the lowest Landau 
level in two-dimensional electron gas with short-range disorders [20]. Additionally, in 
the lowest Landau level, pinned WC dominate over the fractional quantum Hall states 
for νLL < 1/3 or νLL < 1/5, depending on the details of disorders, effective mass, and 
other sample parameters [65-67]. The continuously insulating region from νh = 0 to 
~0.4 observed in tMoTe2 (Fig. 1c) may suggest the formation of WC at zero magnetic 
field, which requires further theoretical and experimental investigations. On the other 
hand, for 2/3 < νh < 1, the quantum states formed in the first moiré Chern band of 3.83° 
tMoTe2 fundamentally differ from those in the lowest Landau level at 2/3 < νLL < 1. 
Both the RIQAH states at νh ≈ 0.7 and the superconducting states are absent in the 
lowest Landau level. The RIQAH state seems to compete with the superconducting 
state, as indicated by the B-dependent ρxx-νh-D and ρxy-νh-D maps (Extended Data Fig. 
4), where the νh ≈ 0.7 RIQAH state takes over the superconducting region under high 
magnetic fields. 
 
Theoretically, anyon superconductivity was first proposed in the fractional quantum 
Hall regime [68-72]. In a flat Chern band, the presence of underlying lattice enables 
anyonic excitations in the FQAH states to exhibit a non-negligible and non-trivial 
dispersion. When the band filling factor is doped away from a rational fraction, novel 
superconducting states can be realized at incommensurate band fillings [14,15]. The 
proposed superconductor pairing mechanism is unconventional, which could coexist 
with spontaneous time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking. Our experimental results 
reveal an intricate interplay among competing superconducting phases, RIQAH states, 
and FQAH states within a single moiré Chern band, suggesting an intrinsic connection 
between the superconducting pairing mechanism and emergent anyonic excitations. 
Further experiments, such as optical Kerr rotation, magnetic circular dichroism 
spectroscopy, and scanning SQUID measurements, are needed to confirm the TRS 
breaking nature of the observed superconductivity. 
 
In conclusion, we have observed a series of IQAH, FQAH, RIQAH states, and 
signatures of unconventional superconductivity within the first moiré Chern band of 
3.83° tMoTe2. The superconducting phase emerges from a normal state exhibiting 
anomalous Hall effects and sustains an exceptionally large perpendicular critical 
magnetic field. These distinctive behaviors differentiate it from prior moiré 
superconductors and underscore its unconventional origin. Our findings not only open 
up an exciting possibility for exploring anyon superconductivity and other exotic 
anyonic quantum matters beyond conventional Landau-level paradigm within moiré 
Chern bands, but also pave the way for interfacing integer and fractional quantum
