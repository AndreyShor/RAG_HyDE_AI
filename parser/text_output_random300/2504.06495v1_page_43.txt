Under this view, our framework of quantum branching with small-signal truncation would
apply only within such localized regions. The branching processes described in this paper
would then represent local structures, rather than global features of the entire universe.
In regions where spacetime is strongly curved, highly dynamical, or fundamentally ill-
deﬁned — such as near spacetime singularities or during the earliest moments of the universe
— the assumptions underlying both the Schr¨odinger equation and our truncation mechanism
may break down. In such regimes, deviations from the Born rule might be expected.
Information conservation
The introduction of small-signal truncation explicitly violates unitarity of the time-evolution
operator — a core principle of quantum mechanics that ensures probability conservation
and reversible time evolution. However, this violation need not imply a fundamental loss of
information or time reversibility. If the Schr¨odinger equation is merely an eﬀective continuum
approximation to a deeper, discrete physical law, then information could still be exactly
preserved at the fundamental discrete level — much like reversible microscopic dynamics in
classical mechanics give rise to apparently irreversible macroscopic behavior.
Furthermore, as we follow our branch of the wave function, information appears to be
lost from our subjective perspective — since within our branch, we experience wave function
collapse, which seems to violate unitarity. This apparent loss mirrors the black hole infor-
mation paradox, and indeed some have argued that if information is eﬀectively inaccessible
to observers anyway, the paradox may be less troubling within a Many-Worlds framework
(see e.g. Wallace 2018). Within our framework, this perspective on the black hole informa-
tion paradox is further complemented by the possibility that even the Born rule may not
hold universally; in extreme regimes where decoherence fails or branching is disrupted, the
conditions for Born rule emergence may break down — suggesting that the coexistence of
apparent information loss and deviations from standard quantum statistics may oﬀer a novel
angle on the paradox itself.
