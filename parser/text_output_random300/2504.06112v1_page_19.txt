FIG. 9: Time evolution in Monte Carlo Steps (MCS) of the fraction of cooperation,
distinguishing individuals based on resource quantity and game type. Two main groups
are considered: the richer group (individuals with resources greater than 1 unit) and the
poorer group (individuals with resources less than 1 unit). Left column (panels (a) and
(d)): Evolution of the fraction of cooperation for the entire system, as well as for the richer
and poorer groups. Central column (panels (b) and (e)) and right column (panels (c) and
(f)) presents the corresponding evolution within ΥSDG and ΥPDG, again distinguishing
between the richer and poorer groups, respectively. The top row (panels (a)–(c))
corresponds to the parameter set σ = 0.2, µ = 0.5, while the bottom row (panels (d)–(f))
corresponds to σ = 0.5, µ = 0.2. The remaining control parameter is set to b = 1.10.
fitness of cooperators remains consistently higher than that of defectors. On the other hand,
for any given value of σ, in the early time steps, the average fitness of both defectors and
cooperators is higher within ΥSDG compared to the overall system. However, the average
fitness of defectors in ΥPDG exceeds that of defectors in ΥSDG. This phenomenon can be
understood in the context of social dilemmas. The dilemma within ΥPDG is more severe than
in ΥSDG, meaning that cooperation is more challenging to sustain in the PDG subpopulation.
Consequently, defectors in ΥPDG and cooperators in ΥSDG obtain higher payoffs compared
to their counterparts in the opposite dilemma setting.
