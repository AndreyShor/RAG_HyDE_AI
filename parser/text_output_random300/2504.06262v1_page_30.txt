of Bloch oscillations and Zener tunneling, which are
optical analogues of electronic transport phenomena in
solids (Zhang et al., 2017).
These effects have been
demonstrated in waveguide arrays and photonic crystals,
where light undergoes periodic oscillations under an ex-
ternal force or tunnels across band gaps between Bloch
states. Such dynamics have been used to engineer optical
beam splitters and robust interconnects for photonic cir-
cuits (Zhang et al., 2017). Additionally, strain-induced
modifications to the lattice can create pseudo-magnetic
fields, leading to the formation of photonic Landau lev-
els—quantized modes that mimic the behavior of elec-
trons in a magnetic field (Barsukova et al., 2024).
The study of photonic lattices has also revealed rich
topological properties. When time-reversal symmetry is
broken, such as through waveguide helicity (see Fig. 19
b) or gyromagnetic materials, topologically protected
edge states emerge, allowing light to propagate without
back-scattering (Barsukova et al., 2024; Mukherjee and
Rechtsman, 2020; Rechtsman et al., 2013). These pho-
tonic analogues of the quantum Hall effect have been re-
alized in honeycomb lattices of waveguides, where light
propagates along the lattice edges in a robust manner,
immune to disorder and defects. Furthermore, the Klein
tunneling effect—where photons traverse a potential bar-
rier without reflection—has been observed in photonic
graphene (see Fig. 19 a), demonstrating an angular de-
pendence in agreement with Dirac-point physics (Zhang
et al., 2022).
Beyond linear effects, photonic lattices serve as an ideal
setting for studying nonlinear wave dynamics and topo-
logical defects (Fleischer et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2019).
In highly nonlinear regimes, optical vortices form and
interact similarly to quantum vortices in superfluid sys-
tems. These optical defects exhibit well-defined dynami-
cal laws, including Magnus forces and mutual vortex in-
teractions, suggesting a deeper connection between pho-
tonic and quantum fluids. The introduction of controlled
nonlinearity further enables the observation of solitons
in topological bands, where light remains self-localized
while moving through the lattice.
Another recent development involves the study of non-
Hermitian photonic lattices, where gain and loss are spa-
tially engineered to break parity-time (PT) symmetry
(Zhang et al., 2018). These systems exhibit exotic phase
transitions and enable new functionalities such as unidi-
rectional invisibility and exceptional-point-based sensors.
Experiments with PT-symmetric photonic lattices have
demonstrated abrupt phase transitions where the eigen-
values of the system shift from entirely real to complex,
leading to a breakdown of conventional wave dynamics.
A detailed review of these effects can be found in (Zhang
et al., 2018).
Overall, photonic lattices provide a versatile testbed
for studying fundamental physics,
from solid-state-
inspired transport phenomena to nonlinear wave interac-
tions and topological effects thanks to the ability to en-
gineer periodic and quasi-periodic potentials, combined
with the intrinsic tunability of optical systems.
VIII. FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
In this review, we have presented a historical overview
of paraxial fluids of light and described recent advances in
the field. In this final section, we propose three research
directions that we envision as particularly promising for
the coming years.
First, exploring the degrees of freedom available in
Bose-Bose mixtures could significantly broaden the scope
of the field. Multiple experimental configurations could
allow for this exploration. In warm atomic vapors, three
promising approaches include using the polarization de-
gree of freedom, employing two lasers tuned to the D1
and D2 lines, or addressing the F=1 and F=2 transitions
of rubidium 87. Among these, only the polarization de-
gree of freedom has begun to be experimentally explored
as we will describe.
Second, identifying nonlinear me-
dia with enhanced control and larger nonlinear indices
(n2) represents another important direction. We propose
utilizing cold atomic clouds trapped in magneto-optical
traps and discuss the advantages offered by such systems.
Finally, we consider the potential of using fluids of light
as platforms to investigate many-body physics.
While
achieving this requires transitioning to different interac-
tion regimes, we outline several promising directions for
future studies.
A. Two-component mixture
The recent realization of two-component fluids of
light by (Piekarski et al., 2024) has extended the field
to multi-component interactions, collective excitations
(Fava et al., 2018), and novel instability regimes. These
experiments have demonstrated the existence of spin
and density modes in a miscible fluid of light (Piekarski
