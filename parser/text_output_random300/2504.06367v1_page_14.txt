bination of CMB data and the predicted 21 cm signal power
spectrum yields very weak constraints in the ( 𝑓WDM−𝑚WDM−1)
plane, with a lower bound of 𝑚WDM > 1.8 keV ( 𝑓WDM = 1),
in contrast to the significantly stronger constraints from the
Lyman-𝛼forest given in this work. In particular, the main
findings of this work can be summarized as:
• We provide new updated constraints on CWDM cos-
mology, where a thermal relic with 𝑚WDM = 1 keV is
allowed for 𝑓WDM < 0.16 (2𝜎). Higher mass bins are vi-
able with increasing abundances, leading to a strong de-
generacy between 𝑓WDM and 𝑚WDM−1 parameters. The
2𝜎contour ( 𝑓WDM −𝑚WDM−1) plane is well-described
by 𝑓WDM = 0.14 (1keV/𝑚WDM)−1.1.
• We update previous Bayesian-inference framework for
1D flux power spectrum Lyman-𝛼forest analysis by in-
tegrating a neural network emulator. Model ensembling
via 𝑘-fold cross-validation reduces the emulator error to
< 0.5% at 2𝜎across all 𝑘-bins.
• We recover a thermal state and evolution of the
IGM consistent with previous Lyman-𝛼forest analyses
([62, 69, 70]), and external measurements ([110, 111],
with very mild variations in 𝑇0 and 𝑢0 due to the strong
degeneracy between these two parameters. The mean
IGM transmission is also in agreement with independent
measurements from e.g. [100, 102, 120].
• Limiting the amount of information in the high 𝑘-modes
results in weaker WDM constraints of 𝑚WDM < 3.6
keV, consistent with previous work by [70]. We further
recover similar findings by [46] on that the instrumental
noise on the data might be underestimated by ≈30%.
• Modeling of patchy reionization and thermally depen-
dent resolution correction can vary the 2𝜎constraints
on 𝑓WDM by ≈5% in most cases. Further work on inves-
tigating the effect of peculiar velocity on small scales,
as pointed out by [46], as well as on a cosmology de-
pendent resolution correction, will help mitigate these
differences.
Our results build upon the latest constraints on pure WDM
from [46], to further highlight the Lyman-𝛼forest as a unique
and sensitive probe of matter clustering on sub-galactic scales.
Extending this analysis to CWDM cosmologies, we find that
the updated constraints have broader implications for any dark
matter model that suppresses the amount of clustering on small
scales. Our findings suggest that the scale of suppression can
be moved to larger scales, but only if the level of the sup-
pression on smaller scales is lower. A logical next step is to
construct a general framework that quantifies the allowed sup-
pression amplitude and its scale dependence, enabling com-
parison across a wide class of dark matter models exhibiting
small-scale power suppression ([62, 121, 122]). A parameter-
isation of this kind was introduced by [123] for a large set of
both thermal and non-thermal relics. We leave the develop-
ment of such a generalised framework for future work.
The main interest in constraining this broad class of dark
matter models lies in their potential to resolve the 𝑆8 tension
when the Lyman-𝛼forest is combined with other large-scale
structure probes (e.g. [124]). For instance, the tension has
been reported to be alleviated when incorporating CMB data
in the presence of axion DM ([34]) or with weak lensing data
([125]). A detailed investigation of the implications for 𝑆8
within the particular CWDM models allowed in this work is
also left for future study.
