where we obtained the matrices Mv and Mx by computing the derivatives of the 2dHPL
were computed with PolyLogTools. The boundary conditions were computed by evalu-
ating the 2dHPL at the point (v = 1/4, x = 1) using GiNaC [136]. We solve the systems
above in a generalised series expansion around v →0, by expanding

The matrix T(ε, v, x) controls the power corrections and it is not needed for the expansion
of ⃗f(v, x) at leading power in v. However, in the quark-gluon amplitude (3.4), some of
the 2dHPLs multiply rational factors involving spurious poles in v, thus requiring the
subleading powers in eq. (3.11)

(3.13)
The matrix Mx(v = 0, x) in eq. (3.10) has a very simple structure.
Its entries are
{1/x, 1/(1 + x)}, and the iterated integrals in eq. (3.10) can be written in terms of HPLs,
with letters {−1, 0}, in the variable x. Finally, the numeric constants in ⃗g0(ε), together
with the constants arising in the path integrals of eq. (3.10), can be written in terms of
Riemann zeta values using the FindIntegerNullVector command in MATHEMATICA
[138], which implements the PSLQ algorithm [139].
By expanding the rational factors appearing in the amplitudes of ref. [130] and re-
placing the HPLs and 2dHPLs with their asymptotic expansion, eq. (3.10), we obtain the
Regge limit of the amplitudes for q + g →q + H and g + g →g + H up to O(ǫ4) at one
loop and up to O(ǫ2) at two loops.
