CAMulator
Figure 1: (a) the CAMulator architecture consists of encoding stages using a CrossFormer backbone and decoding
stages with hierarchical transpose convolutional layers, with skip connections for improved feature flow. (b) The CEL
captures multi-scale features using four convolutional kernels. The LSDA mechanism includes (c)(i) SDA for local
interactions and (c)(ii) LDA for global dependencies. (d) The decoder component employs convolutional upsampling
blocks with skip connections to progressively increase feature map resolution and maintain spatial information. e)
predictions are then de-normalized and past through the four physics conservation blocks prior to loss calculations

Computational Speed and Opportunities
CAM6 achieves significant computational throughput on Derecho, a NSF NCAR supercomputer, with 10 CPU nodes
delivering 14 simulation years per day at the selected resolution. This performance metric reflects pure compute time,
excluding I/O overhead. In contrast, our trained ML-based emulator achieves a dramatic 350 times speedup, running at
480 simulation years per day for a deterministic run on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, while including all computational
overhead and I/O operations. This acceleration enables high-throughput climate experiments, facilitating long-term
scenario projections, ensemble simulations, and uncertainty quantification that would otherwise be computationally
prohibitive with traditional numerical models.
While this speedup is already substantial, further improvements at inference time are possible through:
• Scalability via Ensemble Parallelism: Expanding ensemble members across multiple GPUs to improve
robustness and uncertainty estimation.
• Memory-Efficient Data Handling: Leveraging asynchronous I/O strategies and distributed storage solutions
to further reduce bottlenecks in large-scale climate simulations.
We avoid mixed precision (FP16/BF16) arithmetic to preserve the conservation properties critical for accurate climate
modeling.
This optimized workflow positions the emulator as a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional GCMs, capable of
running thousands of years of simulation within days, opening new avenues for large-ensemble climate forecasting,
extreme event attribution, and policy-relevant decision support.
