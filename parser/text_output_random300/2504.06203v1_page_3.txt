In other words, even though |I⟩is not an element of the orig-
inal Hilbert space, its overlap with any element in the dense
subspace Φ is well-defined. For instance, if |I⟩= |ϕ⟩⟩is an
Ishibashi state corresponding to a scalar primary operator ϕ,
⟨ψ|ϕ(x)⟩⟩= x−∆ϕ
d
.
(II.6)
We emphasize that this overlap is not well-defined for general
states in H (see Appendix F). We have thus explicitly defined
the RHS of equation (II.1).
Now we define the regularization and renormalization of
the defect operator in (II.1). The first step is to regularize the
operator ˆO in the exponent so that it is self-adjoint and has
well-defined spectral decomposition. Here we consider a se-
quence of subspaces H∆⊂H which contain all conformal
families of primary operators ϕα with dimension ∆α ≤∆.
We assume that the CFT spectrum is discrete and does not
contain accumulation points, thus H∆is a finite sum over con-
formal families and a Hilbert space itself. This regularization
still contains an infinite number of states but explicitly pre-
serves the conformal symmetry of the bulk theory which will
be important in the subsequent analysis.
To regularize ˆO amounts to defining its action on H∆. We
define Φ∆= Φ∩H∆and introduce the following sesqulinear
form on Φ∆
(ϕf, ϕg) ≡⟨ϕf| ˆO|ϕg⟩,
(II.7)
for |ϕf⟩, |ϕg⟩∈Φ∆and the RHS is defined by the bulk OPE
(see (B.1)). Using results in Appendix B, there is a unique
self-adjoint operator ˆO∆with a dense domain in Φ∆(thus
also dense in H∆) whose matrix elements coincide with that
of ˆO in (II.7). The operator ˆO∆is self-adjoint but unbounded,
as we describe below [56].
The conformal generators preserving the quantization sur-
face are dilation D, translations Pi, special conformal trans-
formations Ki and SO(d −1) rotations Mij. Acting on the
Hilbert space H, we have explicitly
D|ϕf⟩=
X
a
Z
Rd
+
ddx (xµ∂µ + d −∆a) fa(x) ϕa(x)|0⟩,
Pi|ϕf⟩=
X

Z

+
ddx ∂ifa(x) ϕa(x)|0⟩.
(II.8)
Importantly, the unitary operator Ub = ebD implies,
⟨Ubϕf|Ubϕg⟩= ⟨ϕf|ϕg⟩,
⟨Ubϕf| ˆO∆|Ubϕg⟩= eb(d−1−∆O) ⟨ϕf| ˆO∆|ϕg⟩.
(II.9)
The operator ˆO∆is thus clearly unbounded, since Ub can
be used to indefinitely increase its matrix elements between
normalizable states [57]. By applying the Hellinger–Toeplitz
theorem [58], we deduce that the domain of ˆO∆is a proper
subspace of the Hilbert space, i.e. Φ∆⊂dom( ˆO∆) ⊊H∆.
From (II.9) we also conclude ˆO∆does not possess nontrivial
eigenvectors in H∆.
Nevertheless, generalized eigenvectors of
ˆO∆do exist
in Φ′
∆(as in the Gelfand triple in (II.4)) by invoking the
Gelfand–Maurin theorem [54, 55]. Specifically, we represent
the self-adjoint operator ˆO∆as
ˆO∆=
Z
R
µ dE ˆ
O∆(µ), E ˆ
O∆(µ)E ˆ
O∆(λ) = E ˆ
O∆(min(µ, λ)) .
Here E ˆ
O∆(µ), known as projection measure, denotes the pro-
jection operator onto the closed subspace of H∆where the
expectation value of ˆO∆is less than or equal to µ. Then the
Gelfand-Maurin theorem (see Chap 4 of [55]) assures the exis-
tence of the following derivative (almost everywhere) for any
unit vector |e⟩∈H∆with spectral density σλ defined below,
|λ⟩= dEO∆(λ)
dσλ
|e⟩∈Φ′
∆, dσλ ≡⟨e| dEO∆|e⟩,
s.t. ∀|ψ⟩∈Φ∆, ⟨λ|ψ⟩=
d
dσλ
⟨e|E ˆ
O∆(λ)|ψ⟩,
(II.10)
and |λ⟩are the (generalized) eigenvectors of ˆO∆in Φ′
∆.
With subspaces H∆(e) ≡span({E ˆ
O∆(λ) e}) ⊆H∆, the
Gelfand-Maurin theorem states that if the Hilbert space de-
composes as an orthogonal sum H∆= L
α∈A H∆(eα) for
a set of vectors {eα}α∈A, we can define a spectral measure
dσλ,α and the following decomposition holds
ˆO∆=
Z
R
λ dσλ,α |α, λ, ∆⟩⟨α, λ, ∆| .
(II.11)
Physically, α keeps track of extra symmetry charges that com-
mute with ˆO∆.
For the case of interest, ˆO∆commutes with the momentum
operators Pi and SO(d −1) rotations, which do not mutually
commute and we will choose to diagonalize Pi below [59].
The generic condition stated below (II.1) corresponds to as-
suming the existence of a cyclic vector |e⟩such that all linear
combinations of the form
EO∆(λ)
d−1
Y
i=1
EPi(pi) |e⟩,
(II.12)
span the Hilbert space H∆, where EPi denotes the projection
measure for Pi, we can then decompose ˆO∆in a basis of si-
multaneous eigenstates of ˆO∆and Pi as,
Pi |λ, ⃗p, ∆⟩= pi |λ, ⃗p, ∆⟩,
ˆO |λ, ⃗p, ∆⟩= λ|λ, ⃗p, ∆⟩.
ˆO∆=
Z

dd−1⃗p
(2π)d−1 |⃗p, λ⟩⟨⃗p, λ| ,

This basis is complete, allowing us to express inner products
of states in H explicitly as below,
