Catastrophic Control Parameter βi(t)
The catastrophic control parameter βi(t) is influenced by socioeconomic depri-
vation, violence, and substance abuse:
βi(t) = w1Di(t) + w2Vi(t) + w3SAbi(t)
where w1, w2, w3 are weights reflecting the impact of deprivation, violence, and
substance abuse, respectively.
The pregnancy state yi(t) evolves according to the gradient of the potential
function:
dyi(t)
dt
= −∂V
∂y = −y3
i + αi(t)yi(t) + βi(t)
Peer-group pressure influences contraceptive use and substance abuse. Let
Ni represent the set of neighbors of agent Ai in the social network G. The
influence on contraceptive use is modeled as:
Ci(t + 1) = σ
 
λ2 ·

|Ni|
X
j∈Ni
Cj(t)
!
where σ(x) is the sigmoid function.
Similarly, substance abuse evolves based on peer influence:
SAbi(t + 1) = σ
 
λ3 ·

j∈Ni

The overall simulation evolves by updating the pregnancy state yi(t), contra-
ceptive use Ci(t), and substance abuse SAbi(t) iteratively. Each agent’s state
is influenced by the catastrophic control parameter βi(t), as well as peer-group
pressure from its neighbors.
Figure 2 shows simulations of the Agent-Based Model (ABM) applied to
teenage pregnancy using the cusp catastrophe model. The model incorporates
both non-catastrophic fertility factors—such as education and contraceptive
use—and —catastrophic shocks—deprivation, violence, and substance abuse.
Figure 2 illustrate the state of agents (teenagers) before and after the simulation,
showing who became pregnant under varying socio-economic conditions.
In the initial conditions (Figure 2 left), all agents (represented by blue
markers) are in the non-pregnant state at the beginning of the simulation.
The non-catastrophic fertility factors (X-axis) includes variables like education
quality, parental guidance, and contraceptive use, which are generally preventive
against teenage pregnancy. The catastrophic shocks (Z-axis), in turn, reflects
