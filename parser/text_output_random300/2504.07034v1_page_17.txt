subsonic) at P0. The type of state (2) at P0 for a given wedge angle θw determines the type of
reflection, supersonic or subsonic, as shown in Fig. 4.1 and Fig. 4.2, respectively.
Definition 4.2. (ρ, v) ∈L∞(Λ), with ρ ∈BVloc(Λ ∩Nr(∂Λ)) for some r > 0, is called an
entropy solution of the regular shock reflection problem if (ρ, v) is an entropy solution of system
(2.3)–(2.4) with slip boundary condition (2.13) in the sense of Definition 2.2, which satisfies the
asymptotic conditions:

and ξ0
1 > 0 is the location of the incident shock S0 on the self-similar plane.
Next, we define the points and lines in Figs. 4.1–4.2. The incident shock S0 is line {ξ1 = ξ0

ρ1−ρ0 > 0. The center, O2 = u(2) = (u(2)
1 , u(2)
2 ), of the sonic circle Bc2(O2) of state (2)
lies on the wedge boundary between the reflection point P0 and the wedge vertex P3 for both
the supersonic and subsonic cases.
Then, for the supersonic case, i.e., when |Dφ2(P0)| = |P0O2| > c2 so that P0 /∈Bc2(O2), we
denote by P4 the upper point of intersection of ∂Bc2(O2) with the wedge boundary such that
O2 ∈P3P4. Also, the sonic circle ∂Bc2(O2) of state (2) intersects line S1, and one of the points of
intersection, P1 ∈Λ, is such that segment P0P1 is outside Bc2(O2). Denote the arc of ∂Bc2(O2)
by Γsonic = P1P4. The curved part of the reflected-diffracted shock is Γshock = P1P2, where
P2 ∈{ξ2 = 0}. Then we denote the line segments Γsym := P2P3 and Γwedge := P3P4. The lines
and curves Γshock, Γsonic, Γsym, and Γwedge do not have common points, except their endpoints
P1, · · · , P4. Thus, Γshock∪Γsonic∪Γsym∪Γwedge is a closed curve without self-intersection. Denote
by Ωthe bounded domain restricted by this curve.
For the subsonic/sonic case, i.e., when |Dφ2(P0)| = |P0O2| ≤c2 so that P0 ∈Bc2(O2), the
curved reflected-diffracted shock is Γshock = P0P2, which does not have common interior points
with the line segments Γsym = P2P3 and Γwedge = P0P3. Then Γshock ∪Γsym ∪Γwedge is a closed
curve without self-intersection, and Ωis the bounded domain restricted by this curve.
Furthermore, in some parts of the argument below, it is convenient to extend problem (2.3)–
(2.4) and (2.13), given in Λ by even reflection about the ξ1–axis, i.e., defining
(ρext, vext)(−ξ1, ξ2) := (ρext, vext)(ξ1, ξ2)
for any ξ = (ξ1, ξ2) ∈Λ.
Then (ρext, vext) is defined in region Λext obtained from Λ by adding the reflected region Λ−,
i.e., Λext = Λ ∪{(ξ1, 0) : ξ1 < 0} ∪Λ−. In a similar way, region Ωand curves Γshock ⊂∂Ω
and P0P2 can be extended into the corresponding region Ωext and curves Γext
shock ⊂∂Ωext and
P0P2P ext
0
.
Now we give the definition of a global regular shock reflection solution. The intuition for the
definition is the following: The regular shock reflection solution is an entropy solution of the
regular shock reflection problem in the sense of Definition 4.2 which has the structure shown
in Figs. 4.1–4.2, where (ρ, v) coincides with those of states (0), (1), and (2) in their respective
regions. As we discussed above, the necessary condition is the existence of state (2), which
means that the wedge angle satisfies θw ∈(θd
w, π
2 ). Moreover, it is expected that the solution
is relatively regular in Ω. However, we show below that it is not possible that (ρ, v) ∈H1(Ω).
On the other hand, from the physical/computational experiments and the theoretical results
in the case of potential flow, it is expected that Γshock is a smooth curve and (ρ, v) is smooth
near and up to Γshock ∪Γsonic in Ω.
Moreover, the regularity discussed is expected for the
shock reflection-diffraction configuration extended to {ξ1 < 0} by the even reflection about the
ξ1–axis (since this is the original shock reflection-diffraction configuration). In particular, the
extended shock curve Γext
shock is smooth, which shows that Γshock must be orthogonal to Γsym at
