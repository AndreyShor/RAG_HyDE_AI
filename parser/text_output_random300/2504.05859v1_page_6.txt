MoSe2 to WS2; the time delay (𝜏𝜏) between pump and probe pulses is varied (see the SI 
for details of the ultrafast setup). Hot-hole transfer is not favored, due to the much larger 
ΔV. To be noted, WS2 is kept electrostatically neutral for all ultrafast measurements. 
Let’s first take a glance at TR spectra of optical resonances of WS2 with MoSe2 
electron doped. Figure 2a shows the contour plot of the TR spectrum at varying 𝜏𝜏, from 
which several spectral linecuts are extracted (Figure 2b). The TR signal ∆R R
⁄  is 
defined as (Ron −Roff) Roff
⁄
, where Ron and Roff are the reflected probe spectra 
with and without pump, respectively. The TR spectrum shows appearance of negative 
Fermi polaron resonance (AW
−) of WS2 around 2.03 eV after several ps, evidencing 
transferred hot electrons in WS2. For the more pronounced TR feature around AW 
resonance (~2.06 eV), it shows a complicated temporal evolution: at 𝜏𝜏=0.8 ps, the 
spectral weight of ∆R R
⁄
< 0 is much larger than that of ∆R R
⁄
> 0; from 0.8 to 10 
ps, the spectral weights of ∆R R
⁄
< 0 and ∆R R
⁄
> 0 gradually become comparable; 
after 10 ps, the spectral profile slightly changes. In the following, we will focus on AW 
resonance for its large signal-to-noise ratio.  
This complicated evolution indicates multiple effects following the optical excitation, 
and here we consider three effects––transferred hot electrons, lattice temperature 
increment, and enhanced surrounding screening, the last of which likely arises from 
mobile photoexcited carriers in MoSe2. We identify the TR spectral profiles of AW 
resonance induced by these effects independently, based on the steady RC spectrum
