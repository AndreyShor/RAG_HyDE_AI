Anomalous Z2 extended to Rep(D4)
In this section, we consider again the case of an anomalous Z2, much as in sec-
tion 6.2, but instead of extending it to a nonanomalosu Z4, here we extend to a
nonanomalous noninvertible symmetry, following the language of SymTFTs.
To that end, following the general procedure of section 3, we need an example
of a non-invertible symmetry which has an igSPT phase. We saw in section 6.2
that the Z4 resolution could be understood in terms of an igSPT phase. Another
example with an igSPT phase is Rep(D4), see [10, Table III].
Here the eﬀectively-acting symmetry is again an anomalous Z2, which tells us
(following section 3) that one way to resolve an anomalous Z2 symmetry is via an
extension of fusion categories the form
Vec(Z2 × Z2) Ð→Rep(D4) Ð→Vec(Z2,α).
(7.1)
Let us ﬁrst examine how extending a non-anomalous Vec(Z2) to Rep(D4)
works, both from the SymTFT point of view and in concrete partition function
computations. Recall that the partition function for gauging a Rep(D4) symmetry
can be written (given the ‘usual’ choice of gauge for the associator) as
Z(γa,γb,γc) = 1
8[Z1
1,1 −(Zc
a,b + Zb
a,c + Zc
b,a + Za
b,c + Zb
c,a + Za
c,b)
(7.2)
+ (Za
1,a + Za
a,1 + Z1
a,a) + (Zb
1,b + Zb
b,1 + Z1
b,b) + (Zc
1,c + Zc
c,1 + Z1
c,c)
+ 2γa(Zm
1,m + Zm
m,1 + Z1
m,m + Zm
a,m + Zm
m,a + Za
m,m)
+ 2γb(Zm
1,m + Zm
m,1 + Z1
m,m + Zm
b,m + Zm
m,b + Zb
m,m)
+ 2γc(Zm
1,m + Zm
m,1 + Z1
m,m + Zm
c,m + Zm
m,c + Zc
m,m)],
where (γa,γb,γc), which take the values (−1,1,1), (1,−1,1) or (1,1,−1), param-
eterize the three choices of ﬁber functor on Rep(D4), i.e. the three inequivalent
gaugings of the regular representation.
In the SymTFT, for which we will use the notation of [10, Section II.B] (see
also [24, Appendix A.5] for additional exposition of the anyons in this model,
including their braiding), the initial Rep(D4)-symmetric theory has the algebra
1 ⊕eRGB ⊕mGB ⊕mRB ⊕mRG on its symmetry boundary – this trivializes the D4
symmetry on that boundary, leaving a Rep(D4) which we can take to be given
by {1,eRG,eR,eG,mB}. A theory with an eﬀectively-acting Rep(D4) symmetry
would leave this entire symmetry uncondensed on the physical boundary. Instead,
we would like the Z2 × Z2 subgroup of this Rep(D4) to be trivially-acting, which
we can achieve by taking the algebra
1 ⊕eRG ⊕eR ⊕eG
