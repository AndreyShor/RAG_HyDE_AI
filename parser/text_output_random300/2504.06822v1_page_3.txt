where | h(ph)⟩represents the considered hadronic state with four-momentum ph. Subsequently, by doing the Fourier transfor-
mation through integrating over four-x and then separating the ground state as well as the corresponding excited states, we get
the explicit form of the hadronic correlation function:

where the terms |Ω∗
QQQ′ (q, s)⟩, |˜Ω∗
QQQ′ (q, s)⟩and |Ω∗′
QQQ′ (q, s)⟩represent the contributions of the one-particle spin-3/2 states
of the 1S, 1P and 2S states, respectively. Here, m, ˜m and m′ denote their respective masses, and dots are used to indicate the
contributions of the higher states and continuum. To proceed in the calculation of the matrix elements in Eq. (4), we introduce:
⟨0|ηµ|Ω∗
QQQ′ (q, s)⟩= λ( 3

⟨0|ηµ|˜Ω∗
QQQ′ (q, s)⟩= ˜λ( 3

where λ( 3
2 ), ˜λ( 3

( 3

In order to continue, it is necessary to sum over the Rarita-Schwinger spinors for spin-3/2 baryons, which takes the following
form:

Before proceeding to calculate the correlation function on the hadronic side, it is essential to note that the interpolating current
of the triply heavy spin-3/2 baryons couples not only with spin-3/2 baryons but also with triply heavy spin-1/2 baryons. By
imposing the condition γµJµ = 0, the unwanted contributions from the spin-1/2 states can be expressed as:
⟨0|ηµ|ΩQQQ′ (q, s)⟩= λ( 1

4qµ

where λ( 1
2 ), ˜λ( 1
2 ) and λ′
( 1
2 ) are utilized to represent the various spin-1/2 residues: the 1S, 1P and 2S states, respectively. u(q, s)
is the Dirac spinor. Based on the matrix elements in Eqs. (7), the Lorentz structures, including γµ and qµ, also receive contri-
butions from spin-1/2 states. To eliminate these undesirable contributions mixed with spin-3/2 states, it is necessary to select
structures that exclusively receive contributions from spin-3/2 states. By applying the aforementioned relations, the outcome on
the hadronic side is obtained as follows:
ΠHad
µν (q) =

It can be seen that this expression contains several Lorentz structures. However, only the gµν and̸qgµν structures are free from
contamination by spin-1/2 and arise solely from baryons with spin-3/2. Therefore, the ﬁnal result of the hadronic side is as
follows:
ΠHad
µν (q) =

m2 −q2 (̸q + m)gµν +
˜λ2
˜m2 −q2 (̸q −˜m)gµν +
