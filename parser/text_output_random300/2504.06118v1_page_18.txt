FIG. 8. Ratio of the eigenvalues from the prior covariance matrix (CΠ) to those from the posterior covariance matrix (Cp)
plotted against the covariant principal component analysis (CPCA) mode number. Each panel corresponds to a different data
combination: Top left: BAO alone, Top right: BAO + PantheonPlus, Bottom left: BAO + Union3, and Bottom right: BAO +
DESY5. Blue squares represent DESI DR2, while orange circles represent DESI DR1. The Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)
priors and constraints on the CMB acoustic scale θ∗are imposed in all cases. Modes for which Cp has smaller eigenvalues than
CΠ indicate tighter data constraints relative to the prior.
