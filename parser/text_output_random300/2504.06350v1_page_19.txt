assumption that we make on the devices is that they satisfy the no-signaling constraints in Eq. (7). This
could be enforced by performing each measurements by Alice and Bob as space-like separated events in
def. 6. Clearly, this approach, though theoretically possible, would be extremely costly in practice. A
cheaper possibility—actually the one employed by all existing experiments—is that Alice and Bob each
use one single device repeatedly for the different measurements. The constraints (7) then mean that there
should be no signaling between the individual uses of the devices. This would be the case, for instance, if
the devices had no memory. While such a no-memory assumption may be hard to guarantee in practice,
it is still considerably weaker than the assumption that the devices can be modeled completely, which
is necessary in standard (non DI) cryptography. At the end of the protocol ΠR Alice and Bob generate
the keys kA, kB ∈{0, 1}ℓ(see box 1 sec. 1.3.1) and all the relevant information is characterized by a
distribution pr
kA,kB,T,E|Z where T = {ιi}i is a transcript of the communication, containing all messages
{ιi}i exchanged between Alice and Bob through the authenticated channel (note that T is accessible to
Eve). An ideal QKD protocol produces the distribution
The stronger notion of security, universal composable security [206] warrantees that the composed
scheme that uses QKD is secure as if an ideal secret key was used instead

with KA, KB the secret string taking values on {0, 1}Ns, T = {(ai, bi, xi, yi), hash}i∈Ne the tapescript
of communication containing all messages exchanged between Alice and Bob through the authenticated
channel also accessible to Eve, so that Ne is the set of runs of uncorrelated (x, y) and hash are the
collection of post-processing functions for error correction and privacy amplification. Given that, a QKD
protocol can be seen as a transformation pA,B,E|X,Y,Z 7→ΠKA,KB,BI,T,E|Z.
The historical approach started with the E91 protocol and follows with the adversary constrained to
perform individual or collective attacks, or totally unrestricted [25]. Table 1 provides an overview of the
major DI-QKD protocols and their security scenarios.
