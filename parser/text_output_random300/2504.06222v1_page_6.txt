are displayed in Videos S3 and S4 (Supplementary material). As radiation time increases, new 
phases appear in both crystals, corresponding to the crystal structure of PbBr2. The generation of 
the new composition without organic parts and the weakening of peak intensities for the original 
structure indicate that, in addition to the e-beam, the high-energy X-ray beam can also induce the 
instability of OIHP single crystals, which are also attributed to the volatilization of organic 
components. 
 
 
Figure 3. In-situ synchrotron GI-XRD results of (a) FAPbBr3 and (b) MAPbBr3 single crystals 
under 5E9 ph/Âµm3 @ 11 keV for various durations. Peak intensity ratio changes between PbBr2 
(111) peak and (c) FAPbBr3 (100) peak or (d) MAPbBr3 (100) peak under the X-ray beam 
radiation up to 3000 seconds.
