Proof of Lemma 7.10
82
By [Mad15, Equation (3.10)], we know that there exist constants c1, c2 > 0 such that the probability
on the right-hand side in the previous display is bounded from above by c1e−c2e−bk. Hence, we have
that
F∗(g)4 ≤S−8⌈1/δ⌉8d +

S−8(k + 1)8de−c2e−bk ≲δ−10d ,
where the implicit constant depends on b.
Finally, regarding condition (4), we fix g1, g2 ∈C(Rd) such that supx∈Bb+2|g1(x) −g2(x)| ≤1/8.
Then, thanks to the triangle inequality and Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, we obtain that

We proceed to bound separately (B.2), (B.3), (B.4), and (B.5). We will use repeatedly the fact that,
letting δ = ∥g1 −g2∥∞, it holds that |M0,b(Υb,g1) −M0,b(Υb,g2)| ≤δ and |M0,b+2,b,g1(Υb,g1) −
M0,b+2,b,g2(Υb,g1)| ≤δ.
Regarding (B.2), we have the following bound
|1{M0,b(Υb,g1)≤1} −1{M0,b(Υb,g2)≤1}| ≤1{M0,b(Υb,g1)∈[1−δ,1+δ]} .
Therefore, using [PT79, Theorem 3.1] as in the proof of Lemma 4.13, thanks to the Cauchy–Schwarz
inequality, one obtains that
(B.2) ≲∥g1 −g2∥1/8
∞h(z)F∗(g1) .
Regarding (B.3), we note that
|1{Eg1} −1{Eg2}| ≤1{M0,b+1,b(Υb,g1)+Yb(0)+A+L∈[−δ,δ]} .
Therefore, thanks again to [PT79, Theorem 3.1] and using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, we have
that
(B.3) ≲∥g1 −g2∥1/8
∞h(z)F∗(g1) .
Regarding (B.4), we note that
