should not be confused with the induced GWs from amplified perturbations during, for
instance, an early matter-dominated period [11–14, 88]. In this case, the GWs are sourced
by the gravitational potential of the Poissonian fluctuations associated with the overpro-
duction (dominance) of the PBH, instead of being sourced by the inflaton perturbations.
In essence, the novelty of this approach resides in the fact that the isocurvature perturba-
tions are sourced by the scalar field, contrary to the standard approach where the radiation
fluid sources the isocurvature perturbations [62–66]. Moreover, we do take into account the
whole evolution of the PBH by considering their formation mechanism, instead of assuming
an initial abundance of PBH.
So now the problem at hand is to relate the initial isocurvature fluctuations δPBH,k to
the gravitational potential ΦPBH,k of the PBH fluid. Following [62], this relation is given
by
ΦPBH,k ≃−1

on super-Hubble scales, and by

on sub-Hubble scales, where kPBH = a(tPBH)H(tPBH) is the scale that enters the horizon
by the time PBH dominate, where tPBH is defined in (3.19). What eqns. (3.23) and (3.24)
tell us is that the gravitational potential is constant in time during a PBH-dominated
era, as it is expected from a matter-dominated epoch. One can interpolate between the
two equations to obtain a single expression that reflects the behavior on both super and
sub-Hubble scales, that is
ΦPBH,k ≃−
