are required to bring fluids of light to the truly quantum
optics regime. Once this is achieved, it will become pos-
sible to study quantum depletion in a fluid of light with
potentially quantum correlations within depleted pairs
(Chang et al., 2016; Lopes et al., 2017); the quantum
response to an interaction quench (Larr´e and Carusotto,
2015); the non-classical statistics across phase transitions
(Larr´e et al., 2018) and analogue of spontaneous Hawking
radiation (Jacquet et al., 2022). Such quantum effects
could be realized by carefully exploiting nonlinearities
enhanced by coherent atomic effects, as described previ-
ously. These quantum states would offer a testbed for
examining entanglement generation, quantum squeezing,
and non-local correlations in propagating optical fields.
IX. CONCLUSION
Paraxial fluids of light offer a compelling and highly
controllable platform for exploring quantum hydrody-
namic phenomena. Through the analogy between non-
linear optical propagation and the Gross-Pitaevskii equa-
tion governing ultracold atomic quantum gases, optical
systems have enabled detailed experimental and theoret-
ical investigations of hydrodynamics, superfluidity, and
non-equilibrium dynamics. We have presented recent ex-
periments and highlighted the potential of fluids of light
for probing phenomena such as vortex dynamics, turbu-
lence, quantum correlations, and dimensional crossover
effects. We have also described the significant challenges
that remain, particularly in achieving quantum regimes
and overcoming practical limitations such as intrinsic
classical noise sources. To conclude this review, we have
presented what we believe to be future directions of the
field including the exploration of two-component mix-
tures, coherent nonlinear media with laser-cooled atomic
systems, and studies of quantum effects beyond mean-
field approximations.
