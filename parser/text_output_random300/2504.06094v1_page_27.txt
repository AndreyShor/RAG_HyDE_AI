holds for any ﬁnite sequence (ξi)i ⊂X, where ξ∗η denotes the operator ζ 7→A(ζ, ξ)η on AX.
By [KPW04, Theorem 4.8] we obtain this property from knowing that XA has a projective
basis (hence X is of ﬁnite right numerical index). Now, [KPW04, Corollary 2.26] says that X
is of ﬁnite left index, meaning that the series P
j ⟨ηj|ηj⟩converges in M(A) = A for the strict
topology, whenever (ηj)j is a generalized left basis of X. By [KPW04, Corollary 2.25], we obtain
a projective basis for AX.

Now, for each ﬁnite subset S ⊂Z, consider the projection
eS =
X
i
ξ∗
i ξi ∈K(AX),
where (ξi)i is any choice of projective basis for ASXS.
(In other words, it is the image of
1K(AS XS) ∈K(ASXS) under the not-necessarily unital embedding into K(AX).)
Proposition A.3. Under the above assumptions, we have eS = 1 for big enough S.
Proof. Without knowing that K(AX) is unital, we already know that the family (eS)S converges
to 1 ∈M(K(AX)) = L(AX) for the strict topology. By the existence of ﬁnite projective basis,
we actually have K(AX) = L(AX), and we get ∥1 −eS∥→0. Since eS are projections, we must
have equality ∥1 −eS∥= 0 for big enough S.
□
This shows that X has a left basis localized in some ﬁnite set S, but we still do not have a
control on the size and location of S. Our next goal is to incorporate the quantitative versions
of charge-transporter generation conditions to achieve this.
Proposition A.4. Let L be an integer so that any DHR bimodule have localized basis with
support length L. Given M > 2L, M −L > a > L, and a DHR bimodule Y , consider the
subspaces
Y XM = Span { ⟨η+ | η−⟩ξ−| ξ−∈X[−a−L,−a−1], η−∈Y[−M,−1], η+ ∈Y[0,M] } ,
XY
M = Span { ξ−⟨η+ | η−⟩| ξ−∈X[−a−L,−a−1], η−∈Y[−M,−1], η+ ∈Y[0,M] } .
Then there is a right A[−M,−1]∪[0,M]-linear isomorphism from XY
M to Y XM that preserves the
A-valued inner product.
Proof. Let us ﬁx bases (ξi)i ⊂X and (ηj)j ⊂Y , localized in ﬁnite sets [−M, −a] and [−L, −1].
Consider the A[−M,−1]∪[0,M]-bimodule
Z = X[−M,−1] ⊠A[−M,−1] Y[−M,−1] ⊗Y[0,M].
Note that the vectors ξi ⊗ηj ⊗η+ generate Z as a right A[−M,−1]∪[0,M]-module.
There is a surjective right A[−M,−1]∪[0,M]-homomorphism f1 : Z →XY
M given by
f1(ξ−⊗η−⊗η+) = ξ−⟨η+|η−⟩.
To be precise, we write ξ−as a linear combination P
i ξiai for ai ∈A[−M,−1] and send ξ−⊗η−⊗η+
to P
i ξi ⟨η+|aiη−⟩∈XY
M, which indeed agrees with ξ−⟨η+|η−⟩.
There is also a surjective A[−M,−1]∪[0,M]-homomorphism f2 : Z →Y XM given by
f2(ξ−⊗η−⊗η+) = ⟨η+|η−′⟩ξ−′,
where η−′ ⊗ξ−′ denotes the image of ξ−⊗η−under the braiding X ⊠A Y →Y ⊠A X, which
restricts to a map X[−M,−1] ⊠A[−M,−1] Y[−M,−1] →Y[−M,−1] ⊠A[−M,−1] X[−M,−1].
Then, with ξ−= ξi and η−= ηj, we have η−′ ⊗ξ−′ = ηj ⊗ξi. Let us compare the inner
products between the vectors fk(ξi ⊗ηj ⊗η+).
For k = 2, we get
⟨⟨η+
2 |ηj2⟩ξi2| ⟨η+
1 |ηj1⟩ξi1⟩= ⟨ξi2| ⟨ηi2|η+
2 ⟩⟨η+
1 |ηj1⟩ξi1⟩.
