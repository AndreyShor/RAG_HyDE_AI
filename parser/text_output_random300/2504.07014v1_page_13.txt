ν′ = 1/2 and the divergent susceptibility with γ = 1/2. At low filling εF ∝k2
F, which gives
z = 2. So the Lifshitz transition 2 →0 in the TLL is in the universality class of the free
fermions with the critical indices (29) for d = 1.
The bosonization of the Tomonaga-Luttinger model of spinless fermions yields the
density-density correlation function [46]:
⟨ρ(x)ρ(0)⟩∝1
x2 + oscillating terms ,
(37)
which can be used as an additional cross-check.
In contrast to its counterpart for free
fermions, it contains a perfectly scale-free first term. By matching 2d = d + z −2 + η we
recover η = 1.
The value α = 1/2 of the TLL obtained from the scaling relations warrants a special
comment. The conformal field theory (d = 1 + 1) result for the entanglement entropy (see
[40] for different derivations and original references) is:
S(L) = c
3 ln L
ϵ + ... ,
(38)
where c = 1 is the central charge of the free bosonic field and ϵ is the UV cutoff. With ϵ ∼ξI
it agrees with the exact result of Jin and Korepin [43] for the XX chain in the limit L ≫ξI.
According to the results of Vidal et al [55], the XX (free fermions) and XXX (TLL) chains
demonstrate the same universal behavior (38) with c = 1 far from the Lifshitz point in the
gapless phase, when one can probe the regime L ≫ξI.
The Lifshitz point of the transverse XX chain at hc is a special point, where the lines of
quantum criticality and the disorder line (ξI →∞) merge. The latter is also the disentan-
glement line. The entanglement measured by different quantities: concurrence [29], global
entanglement [41, 42], and von Neumann entropy [43] (cf. (24)), vanish at hc.6 The exact
results on the factorizing field of the transverse XXZ chain [56] confirm that the critical
field hc is also the field of disentanglement (disorder line). Then the scaling relations and
the available non-interacting result (24) [43] imply that the entanglement of the XXZ chain
vanishes at hc = 1 −∆as
S ∝−(hc −h)1/2 ln(hc −h) ,
h →h−
c .
(39)
More generally, we conjecture that if the Lifshitz point of the gapless d-dimensional fermionic
liquid is also the disorder point where ξI →∞, then the entanglement S vanishes from the
gapless side as
S ∝|µ −µc|1−α ,
(40)
(possibly up to a logarithmic factor) with α given by (29).

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
In this work we studied critical properties and ground-state phases of several models of
d-dimensional fermions. We used the Yang and Lee approach to detect a phase transition
6 The Lifshitz critical point P →0 is not necessarily the disorder point where ξI →∞. The example is
the two-leg ladder at the critical point µc,2, cf. Eq. (A27). The Fermi sea vanishes not at the center/edge
of the BZ (ℑz± = 0 in such case), but somewhere at an IC point kmax where ℑz±(hc,2) ̸= 0. See Figs. 4
and 5. The IC oscillations continue into the gapped phase. The scaling relations are preserved, while from
the results of [29] we expect a residual entanglement at µc,2 which does not affect the divergence of C as in
Eq. (23).
