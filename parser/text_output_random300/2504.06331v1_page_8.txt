Notes. From left to right, the columns detail a brief description of each parameter, its reference name as used in this work, the assumed prior
range, and the best-fit values with their statistical errors. Priors are assumed to be either uniform or log-uniform for each parameter, except for the
inclination angle, for which we assumed a uniform distribution on the solid angle.
The presence of asymmetric BELs has often been associated
with the existence of a SMBHB; this hypothesis is particularly
intriguing in the case of PG 1302-102, which has already been
identified as a candidate SMBHB due to the modulation in its
optical light curve (Graham et al. 2015b). As was discussed in
Sec. 1, the asymmetric emission profile of a SMBHB can result
from the orbital motion of two black holes. This occurs when
the separation between the black holes is large enough for at
least one to retain its own BLR. To satisfy this condition the
BLR should not cross the Hill radius of the black hole17. The
obvious way to test this hypothesis would be to observe, on an
orbital timescale (i.e., ≃5.5 ± 0.15yr for PG 1302-102, Zhu &
Thrane 2020), the expected Doppler drift in the BEL profiles
(Popovi´c 2012). Optical spectra of PG 1302-102 taken at differ-
ent times are already available (Boroson & Green 1992; Graham
et al. 2015b) possibly allowing us to check if a wavelength shift
over 5 years is present. However, the spectrum presented in Gra-
ham et al. (2015b) was taken in April 2014, while ours was dur-
ing March 2018, giving a time difference too close to the binary
orbital period. Similarly, the spectrum presented in Boroson &
Green (1992) was taken in April 1990, which, assuming the 5.5
year period of the binary, would be close to exactly 5 periods
before our observation. Also, 18 optical spectra of PG 1302-102
were taken from January to June 1990 by Jackson et al. (1992);
even in that case no variability was observed in the Hβ emission
line. Still, we have analyzed the spectra presented in Boroson &
Green (1992) (the only one publicly available) without finding
statistically meaningful differences in the emission profile. The
error on the estimated ∆µB was large enough to be consistent
both with the presence of the Doppler shift reported in Tab. 1
or with zero shift. We do not exclude this behavior from being
caused by the low resolution and low S/N of the data.
17 We note that in the case of a disk-like BLR, the radius decreases by
a factor of ≃4 −5 due to the lack of stability in circular orbits outside
of it Runnoe et al. (2015).
In the case of PG 1302-102, it would be tempting to com-
pare the periodicity of the light curve (i.e., ≃5.5 ± 0.15 yr, Zhu
& Thrane 2020) with the observed shift in the Balmer BELs
(see Fig. 2). In the case of the less redshifted component (i.e.,
∆µB ≃450 km/s), assuming circular motion and a binary of
mass 108.8 M⊙, we obtain an upper limit for the separation of the
two BHs of ≃14 pc18. This is not inconsistent with the ≃5.5-
year period observed in the light curve (Zhu & Thrane 2020),
which, still assuming circular motion, corresponds to a separa-
tion of R ≃0.015 pc (see Ep. 1 of Yu & Lu 2001). However, it
must be said that even excluding any kind of obscuration, only
few specific combinations of the binary inclination (i) and az-
imuthal (ϕ) angle result in the right deprojection of the velocity
to obtain the 5.5 yr period. Either the plane of the binary is close
to face-on or the line joining the two black holes is parallel to the
line of sight. By assuming a uniform distribution for ϕ between
−π/2 and π/2 and a distribution uniform in sin i between 0 and
π/4 we can give a rough estimate of the probability of obtain-
ing the right deprojection of the velocity to get the 5.5 yr period
of ≃4%19. Therefore, although the data do not completely rule
out the hypothesis of two distinct BLRs producing the observed
BEL asymmetry, this scenario is very unlikely.
Our alternative explanation for the asymmetric emission of
the Balmer BEL invokes the presence of a perturbation that
breaks the axis symmetry in the disk of a single BLR, which
could either surround a single SMBH or a binary SMBH system.
Following Storchi-Bergmann et al. (2003a), we modeled the per-
turbation with a spiral overdensity. Our analysis indicates such
18 Since we do not know the inclination angle and the phase of the pu-
tative binary any radius smaller than 14 pc cannot be rejected.
19 This estimate takes into account the error on the period of the binary
(≃0.15yr) and the error of the black hole mass (≃0.5dex). If we had
assumed to know precisely the black hole mass, the probability would
have decreased to ≃0.1%.
