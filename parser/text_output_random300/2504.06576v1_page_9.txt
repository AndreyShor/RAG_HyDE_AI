3.3.3. Flux in Boundary Layer
In mathematical terms, the above two sections discuss the dependence of the first and
second derivatives of the dimensionless stream function 𝑓on a parameter caused by the
strong magnetic field. In this section, the zero derivative of 𝑓(i.e. itself) will be the focal
point of discussion. It is important to note that this quantity possesses physical significance,
as it corresponds to the velocity flux in the boundary layer region. It is not difficult to derive
the flux formula 𝑞=

𝜕𝜂𝛿d𝜂= 𝑈𝛿𝑓𝛿using the definition of Stokes stream function. The
𝑓𝛿is the value of 𝑓at 𝜂= 1 position. The application of the Taylor expansion method from
the preceding section enables the derivation of an approximate formula for the flux under
conditions of strong magnetic fields.

As shown in figure 3(b), the flux scaling law is consistent with the direct output data of the
analytical solution (taking 𝑊𝑥= 1). Physically, the Lorentz force promotes mass transport in
the boundary layer. When the magnetic field is relatively strong, the concise inverse square
root scaling law can be used to estimate the boundary layer flux. This section elucidates the
physical impact of the Lorentz force on the boundary layer of a transient stagnation flow
using exact mathematical formulae.
4. Converging Flow (𝑘= −1)
The boundary layer solutions for converging channel flow, as investigated by Pohlhausen
(1921), Landau (1976), and Sun (2024), can also be extended to an unsteady MHD model.
Consider placing a thin wire carrying a constant electrical current intensity, denoted as 𝐼,
perpendicular to the flow direction at the cusp (the coordinate origin). According to the Biot-
Savart law, the distribution of the magnetic field generated by the current is 𝐵(𝑥) = 𝜇0𝐼
2𝜋𝑥. In
this context, the Lorentz force term in the momentum equation does not explicitly include the
x-coordinate. To derive an analytical solution, we will apply the short-time approximation
proposed by Sun (2024). The mathematical properties of the simplified momentum equation
align completely with equation (3.4).

Still assigning coefficient 𝛽= 1. Using the same substitution method, just replace the
