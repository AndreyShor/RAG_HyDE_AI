Figure S3. Determination of the conduction band offset between MoSe2 and WS2. (a-
e) The contour plots of the RC spectrum as a function of 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸 at various 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷. The dashed 
line denotes the critical 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸, denoted as 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸
∗, above which doped electrons start to move 
from MoSe2 to WS2. (f) The electric fields within the device. (g) The 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸
∗ as a function 
of 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷. The straight line is a linear fitting, from which we can obtain the doping-
dependent Δ𝐶𝐶 with 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸=0 V, shown as the right y-axis. 
5. Estimation of initial 𝒏𝒏𝒆𝒆𝒆𝒆 
For estimating 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒, we first calculated the interference within the device with the 
transfer matrix method. By using the thickness of each layer that was obtained either 
by AFM or by the contrast analysis of the optical image, the pump intensity (𝐼𝐼) in MoSe2 
is related with that out of the device (𝐼𝐼0), by 𝐼𝐼≈1.75𝐼𝐼0. Then, we estimated how many 
photons absorbed by monolayer MoSe2 at light frequency of 𝜔𝜔, by ൬1 −𝑒𝑒−2𝜅𝜅𝜅𝜅𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚
𝑐𝑐
൰𝐼𝐼, 
and assumed that each photon generates one exciton. c is the speed of light in vacuum, 
and 𝜅𝜅(≈0.6 for 1.746 eV)[4] is the imaginary part of the refractive index of MoSe2. 
With the calculation above, about 1.1% of 𝐼𝐼0 are converted to excitons.
