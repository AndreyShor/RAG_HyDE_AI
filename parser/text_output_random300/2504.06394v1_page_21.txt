Figure 9: Velocity profiles for 𝑡= 0.5, including the finite fluid inertia correction. Dashed
black line: St = 0, blue markers: numerics, solid red line: St > 0 model.
Figure 9 also shows the predictions of the leading-order in St asymptotic results presented
in this section. As might be expected, we see much better agreement between the prediction
accounting for St > 0 via (5.2b) and (5.7) (shown by solid red curves in figure 9) and
the results of COMSOL simulations (points) than with the earlier result, which neglected
the effects of fluid inertia entirely. We emphasize that this finite inertia case requires the
numerical calculation of the integrals in (5.2b) and (5.7).
We now consider if domain irregularities can give rise to interesting flow phenomena, in
particular unexpected symmetry breaking and vortical flows when 𝜅≪1, which have been
reported previously (Boselli et al. 2013).
6. Analytical description of vortical flow
As a final point of analysis, we turn our attention to the possibility of vortical flow: several
authors have reported the existence of vortical structures in computational studies of flow in
the utricle, the enlarged portion of the semicircular canal (see Boselli et al. 2009; Goyens
et al. 2019, for example). Vortices appear to occur even in the analogue of our limit 𝜅≪1,
when the flow in the slender portion of the canals is largely symmetric. In this section we
use our asymptotic analysis to give an analytical description of such vortical flow structures
and determine the geometrical conditions required for their emergence.
Mathematically, the reason why we might expect enlarged regions of the canal to experience
symmetry breaking may be seen from the form of the leading order and 𝑂(𝜖) axial velocity
terms in (3.14). In particular, in regions where 𝑎(𝑠) > 1, the magnitude of the leading order
velocity 𝑤0 is proportional to 1/[𝐼4 𝑎(𝑠)4], while the correction is of order 𝜖the 𝑓(𝑡) term
in (3.14b) remains 𝑂(𝜖) even as 𝑎(𝑠)4 becomes large. (We retain the 𝐼4 term here, since it
is also dependent on 𝑎(𝑠).) Hence, we might expect noticeable asymmetry in the flow to
develop in regions where 1/[𝐼4𝑎(𝑠)4] is comparable to 𝜖. Note that this can be achieved
in this way without requiring that we are in the stiff cupula regime 𝜅≫1 that led to the
symmetry-breaking discussed in Section 3.2.
To demonstrate this possibility, we consider the predictions of our asymptotic theory for
a canal with a localized bulge by taking the radius 𝑎(𝑠) to be the sum of a constant and a
Gaussian:
𝑎(𝑠) = 1 + (𝑎𝑚−1)𝑒−𝛾(𝑠−𝜋)2.
(6.1)
Here, the cupula and utricle are located at 𝑠= 𝜋, 𝛾is a parameter controlling the width of the
enlargement and 𝑎𝑚is the maximum inner radius of the tube. This choice is motivated by the
qualitative agreement with the imaging from Daocai et al. (2014). In Figure 10 we plot the
velocity distribution for several channel geometries, in particular a top view of the mid plane
of the flow around the canal, with colour indicating the magnitude of the axial velocity. The
size of the enlarged region is increased from left to right (with 𝛾= 1 and 𝑎𝑚= 1, 2, 3, 4), and
the appearance of the vortical flow is clear. The forcing is given by (3.19) and we visualize
