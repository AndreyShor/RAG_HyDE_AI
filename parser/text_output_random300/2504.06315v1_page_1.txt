Abstract
The cardiovascular and ocular systems are intricately connected, with hemodynamic interactions playing a cru-
cial role in both physiological regulation and pathological conditions. However, existing models often treat these
systems separately, limiting the understanding of their interdependence. In this study, we present the Eye2Heart model,
a novel closed-loop mathematical framework that integrates cardiovascular and ocular dynamics. Using an electrical-
hydraulic analogy, the model describes the interactions between the heart and retinal circulation through a system
of ordinary differential equations. The model is validated against clinical and experimental data, demonstrating
its ability to reproduce key cardiovascular parameters (e.g., stroke volume, cardiac output) and ocular hemody-
namics (e.g., retinal blood flow). Additionally, we explore in silico the effects of intraocular pressure (IOP) and
left ventricular compliance on both local ocular and global systemic circulation, revealing critical dependencies
between cardiovascular and ocular health. The results highlight the model’s potential for studying cardiovascular
diseases with ocular manifestations, paving the way for patient-specific data integration and expanding applications
in personalized medicine.

Introduction
The intricate relationship between the cardiovascular and ocular systems is essential for understanding a range of
physiological and pathological processes [8, 12]. Although both systems are crucial for maintaining systemic balance,
their interdependence has not been thoroughly explored in current research. The cardiovascular system regulates sys-
temic blood flow, which includes ocular perfusion, while intraocular pressure (IOP) and retinal blood flow are critical
for maintaining ocular health. Studies have examined retinal vascular characteristics as indicators of cardiovascular
health [23, 33], and changes in cardiovascular status are known to affect retinal microvasculature [1]. Recent advance-
ments, such as automated retinal photography and AI-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment systems,
have shown promise for non-invasive CVD risk evaluations, presenting a more streamlined alternative to traditional
clinical methods [14]. Additionally, the standardization and clinical use of retinal imaging biomarkers for CVD are
becoming increasingly important in the effort to incorporate ocular data into cardiovascular risk assessments [4].
Advances in AI-driven ocular image analysis have significantly contributed to CVD prediction, including the
identification of risk factors and the potential replacement of conventional biomarkers [15]. However, existing models
often treat the cardiovascular and ocular systems as separate entities, concentrating on either cardiac and vascular
dynamics or isolated ocular physiology. This compartmentalized approach has led to a limited understanding of how
the two systems interact. A more integrated view is necessary to capture their physiological interdependence. Current
