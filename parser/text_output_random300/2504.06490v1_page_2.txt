dent on the Higgs boson having non-vanishing transverse
momentum and enables to further broaden the set of ob-
servables of Higgs boson physics. Extending predictions
for the production of a Higgs boson in association with
a jet to N3LO remains a formidable challenge.
Moti-
vated by the ambition to enable one-percent precision
phenomenology at the LHC [43] we take here a decisive
step towards this goal.
An essential ingredient of perturbative corrections is
the availability of scattering amplitudes to the required
order in perturbation theory. In this Letter, we focus on
three-loop corrections to amplitudes describing the scat-
tering of a Higgs boson and three partons. Results at
one and two loops for these scattering amplitudes were
obtained in refs. [44–49]. The past computations of these
scattering amplitudes have provided not only key ingre-
dients to today’s LHC phenomenology program but also
led to deeper understanding of the functions these ampli-
tudes are comprised of (see for example refs. [50, 51]), to
improved computational techniques [52] and to a flurry
of activity of understanding formal gauge theory [53–57].
The technology enabling the computation of these partic-
ular scattering amplitudes is then applicable to a range of
scattering processes, most notably the scattering ampli-
tudes relating three partons and a vector boson [58–61].
Figure 1 shows an example Feynman diagram con-
tributing to the three-loop corrections of the scattering
amplitude relating a Higgs boson and three gluons. To
tame the immense complexity of these amplitudes we re-
strict our computation to the generalized leading color
contributions treating the number of colors Nc of QCD
and number of light quark flavors nf as large and neglect
corrections that are suppressed beyond the leading term
in these parameters by inverse powers of the number of
colors. Due to the direct coupling of the Higgs boson to
gluons in the effective theory of eq. (1) and the color-
singlet nature of the Higgs the generalized leading color
limit of the scattering amplitude is not only given by so-
called planar diagrams [62]. Non-planar diagrams, such
as the one displayed in fig. 1, drastically increase the com-
plexity of perturbative computations and put our results
at the forefront of the field.
Our results will find application beyond the predic-
tion of the production cross section for a Higgs boson
and a jet. First, our scattering amplitudes are a natu-
ral ingredient to the inclusive production probability of
a Higgs boson at the next order, N4LO. Furthermore,
the advent of future lepton collider facilities promise to
study hadronic decays of the Higgs in astounding detail.
A range of planned facilities like the FCC-ee [63, 64],
CEPC [65], ILC [66], C3 [67] or future muon colliders
would provide the opportunity to study jets as decay
products of the Higgs boson. While inclusive hadronic
decay rates are known to be of astounding fourth order
in QCD [68–71], differential two and three jets rates are
currently available through N3LO [72] and NNLO [73, 74]
respectively. Advancing the latter to N3LO requires the
computation of the scattering amplitudes computed here.

We compute three-loop scattering amplitudes relating
a Higgs boson H with momentum q and three partons
with momenta ki, i ∈{1, 2, 3}. We start by considering
the decay region, which describes the process of the Higgs
boson decaying to three gluons or to a gluon and a quark
anti-quark pair.

H(q) →g(k1) + q(k2) + ¯q(k3).

in the framework of dimensional regularization with d =
4−2ϵ space time dimensions in the modified minimal sub-
traction scheme MS to regulate infrared and ultraviolet
singularities of our scattering amplitudes. The definition
of aS in the above equation anticipates renormalization
in the MS by absorbing universal factors of (4π) and the
Euler-Mascheroni constant γE. To compute the ingre-
dient necessary for physical scattering cross sections we
multiply our scattering amplitudes with their tree level
counterparts and sum over spin and color degrees of free-
dom of the external partons.
