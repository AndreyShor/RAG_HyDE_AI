Recently, gravitational waves (GWs) originating from cosmic strings have been high-
lighted as a way to probe high energy models (i.e. GUTS) [109–114]. Assuming that we have
inflation before the formation of cosmic strings, when they intersect and form loops their
network acts as a GW source. When transitioning between different states, they emit strong
beams of GW of high frequency. Additionally, the loops oscillate, shrink and emit energy in a
gravitational manner. This radiation is a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB).
An approach to compute SGWB can be found in [115], where Nambu-Goto strings are as-
sumed that decay predominantly via gravitational radiation. The decay of cosmic strings of
the type discussed above releases energy that can be transferred to gravitational radiation.
Regarding Nambu-Goto strings, the dominant contribution to GW signal comes from
large loops and thus we focus on them. After the formation of the strings, the loops emit
gravitational radiation at a constant rate:

dt = −ΓGµ2 ,

where G is the Newton constant, µ is the string tension and Γ ∼50 [116]. The value of
Gµ can be explored and constrained by current and near future GW detectors. in the Hz
regime, LIGO (O3) [117] excludes the formation of cosmic strings at Gµ ∼10−8 in the high-
frequency range of 10 −100 Hz. In the nHz range, EPTA [118] and NANOGrav [119] set an
upper bound of Gµ at 6 × 10−11. However, the strongest constraint comes from the PPTA
collaboration [120], setting an upper bound at 1.5 × 10−11.
In our study in Subsection 7.1 we have chosen four breaking chains that lead from the
SO(10) GUT to the SM along the lines of [85], denoted 422, 422D, 3221 and 3221D respec-
tively, and we have calculated the intermediate scale MI and the unification scale MGUT for
each case, using 1-loop β-functions for minimal field content (the results are given in Table
2). In [121] one can find a 2-loop calculation of intermediate and unification scales for all
the breaking chains of SO(10) with one intermediate breaking, including the four cases we
use in our study. We follow their comprehensive analysis, which compares their numerical
results regarding the respective scales to the experimental bounds on proton decay/lifetime
of Super-K and Hyper-K. It turns out that neither 422D nor 3221D satisfy the bounds set
by Super-K, while 422 and 3221 are just above the lower bounds for MGUT. However, if
during the 10-year exposure time of the future Hyper-K experiment proton decay is not ob-
served, 3221 will be excluded as well. The above leave 422 as the candidate with the highest
survivability against the stringent constraints of the Kamiokande experiments.
Regarding the production of topological defects from the various breakings of the four
cases (see [121] for a complete categorization), the breaking of the SO(10) gauge group leads
to monopoles in all cases and additional cosmic strings in 422D and 3221D. This means
that inflation should happen after this breaking to prevent monopoles from dominating the
Universe’s energy density and, even in the two cases we have cosmic strings, they will be
washed out from inflation and their gravitational signal is rendered undetectable.6
If we
consider the intermediate breakings of each case, we have the production of monopoles from
the breaking of the 422 gauge group, monopoles and domain walls from the 422D breaking,
cosmic strings from 3221 and cosmic strings and domain walls from 3221D. With the same
6This means that any gravitational signal originating from the breakings at MX and MB will also be
completely diluted by inflation.
