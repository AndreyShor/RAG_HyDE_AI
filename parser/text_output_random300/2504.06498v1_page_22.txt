Chemical exchange effects from SABRE were found negligible, as evidenced by minimal
linewidth differences in 𝐽-spectra with different catalyst concentrations as shown in Fig. S2.
SABRE-pumping.
The pumping term ˆ𝑃ensures steady-state state aligns with the SABRE-
hyperpolarized population imbalances at zero-field,
ˆˆ𝑅ˆ𝜌eq + ˆ𝑃= 0,
(S8)
In the absence of external field, the steady state is isotropic, i.e., it has no preferred directions in
space. As a result, the quantum states with the same the total angular momentum (𝐹) and total
proton angular momentum (𝐾) have the same populations. And the steady-state
ˆ𝜌eq can be fully
describe by two parameters (see Fig. S3), 𝛼(for population imbalances in 𝐾= 3/2 manifold) and 𝛽
(for population imbalance in 𝐾= 1/2 manifold). The values of are determined from the integrated
signals of 1-𝐽and 2-𝐽peaks from a “ZF-ZF” experiment (36) with a 90◦15N-1H DC pulse:

The numerical solver.
The master equation is solved via Strang splitting, which separates coher-
ent and dissipative dynamics with second-order accuracy. The density operator ˆ𝜌(𝑡) evolves over a
timestep Δ𝑡as follows:
1. Coherent half-step: Apply unitary evolution with:
ˆ𝑈1 = 𝑒
