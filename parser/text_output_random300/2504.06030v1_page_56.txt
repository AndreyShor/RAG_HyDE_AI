and we have taken ϕ0 = 0.
To apply this result we need to approximate rc and thus α.
Below is a computer simulation of the full 3-dimensional dynamical system showing
clearly the spiral nature of a particle’s path.
Circular Spiral Path.
The image below of the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101) would appear an ideal candidate to
test these results. We invite the astronomical community to make detailed observations
which could help to support our ideas.
