high-frequency end of the spectrum from influencing the
fit, as described by Equation (7). The REDFIT analy-
sis detected prominent peaks at frequencies of ∼0.00128
day−1 (781 ± 160 days) in the γ-ray lightcurve (see the
left panel of Figure 5) and ∼0.00132 day−1 (757 ± 160
days) in the optical lightcurve (see the right panel of Fig-
ure 5). The uncertainties in the periods were estimated
using the methodology described in Section 3.1.
4. GAUSSIAN PROCESS MODELING
The observed variability in AGN is inherently stochas-
tic. The AGN light curves can be well described by the
stochastic processes, also known as Continuous Time
Autoregressive Moving Average [CARMA(p, q)] pro-
cesses (B. C. Kelly et al. 2014), defined as the solutions
to the stochastic differential equation:
dpy(t)
dtp
+ αp−1
dp−1y(t)
dtp−1
+ ... + α0y(t) =
βq
dqϵ(t)
dtq
+ βq−1
dq−1ϵ(t)
dtq−1
+ ... + β0ϵ(t),
(7)
where, y(t) represents a time series, ϵ(t) is a contin-
uous time white noise process, and α∗and β∗are the
coefficients of autoregressive (AR) and moving average
(MA) models, respectively. Here, p and q are the order
parameters of AR and MA models, respectively.
The simplest model is a continuous autoregressive
[CAR(1)] model, also known as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process. It is a popular red noise model (B. C. Kelly
et al. 2009; S. Koz lowski et al. 2009; C. L. MacLeod
et al. 2012; J. J. Ruan et al. 2012; Y. Zu et al. 2013; J.
Moreno et al. 2019; C. J. Burke et al. 2021; H. Zhang
et al. 2022, 2023; A. Sharma et al. 2024b; H. Zhang et al.
2024; A. Sharma et al. 2024c), usually referred to as the
Damped Random Walk (DRW) model, described by the
following differential equation:
 d

τDRW

y(t) = σDRW ϵ(t)
(8)
where τDRW and σDRW are the characteristic damp-
ing time-scale and amplitude of the DRW process, re-
spectively.
The mathematical form of the covariance
function of the DRW model is defined as
k(tnm) = a · exp(−tnm c),
(9)
where tnm = |tn −tm| denotes the time lag between
measurements m and n, with a = 2σ2
DRW and c =
1
τDRW .
The power spectral density (PSD) of the DRW model is
defined as:
S(ω) =
r

1 + ( ω

(10)
The DRW PSD has a form of Broken Power Law
(BPL), where the broken frequency fb corresponds to
the characteristic damping timescale τDRW =
1
2πfb .
In the best-fit parameters estimation of the DRW
model for both light curves, we employed the Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm provided by the
emcee6 package (D. Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). For
the modeling, we employed the EzTao7 package, which
is built on top of celerite8. In this study, we generated
the distributions of the posterior parameters by running
10000 steps as burn-in and 20000 as burn-out.
5. PROBE THE SIGNIFICANCE
AGN emissions exhibit stochastic variability and are
well characterized by red noise.
The combination of
red noise, characteristic nature, and uneven sampling
in the light curve can lead to spurious peaks in the pe-
riodogram. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the sig-
nificance of any periodic signals detected in the light
curves. In the estimation of significance, we employed
two different approaches.
The periodogram is usually represented as a power
spectral density (PSD) of a form P(ν) ∼Aν−β, where
the temporal frequency is represented by ν and β > 0
represents the spectral slope. In the first approach, to
calculate the statistical significance of the periodic fea-
ture, we employed the approach developed by D. Em-
manoulopoulos et al. (2013). The methodology involved
modeling the observed PSD using a power-law model.
For that, we employed DELightcurveSimulation9 code,
which involved randomizing the amplitude and phase
of the Fourier components, each mimicking the charac-
teristics of the original data, including the best-fitting
power-law model slope and similar properties in terms
of flux distribution. We performed a Monte Carlo simu-
lation, generating 5 × 104 synthetic light curves for each
case.
The simulations were based on the best-fitting
power-law model slopes (β = 0.48±0.16 for γ-rays light
curve and β = 1±0.16 for ASAS-SN light curve) utiliz-
ing their flux distribution properties respectively. Each
simulated light curve for both cases mimics the underly-
ing properties of the original light curves. After that, we
generated the Lomb-Scargle periodogram of each simu-
lated light curve as we did for both original light curves.
To estimate the significance level of the dominant peak
in original LSPs, we calculated the 84th, 97.5th, 99.85th,
and 99.995th percentiles of the 50000 simulated LSP for
