Due to the Markov approximation, terms of O(1/(Mplβ)) are neglected, which is justified unless
the system is near the Planck scale.

Summary so far
Combining Eqs. (3.18)-(3.20) and (3.46)-(3.47), as well as elevating free variables to their non-
perturbative counterparts by matching their initial values, we obtain the Heisenberg equations
averaged over a general quantum state:
n′ = 2a′

Note that in the interaction terms in Eqs. (3.46) and (3.47), n and λ correspond to their free values
indexed as 0, while they can be identified with their non-perturbative counterparts at the initial
time. At each time step, the perturbed values of n and λ are computed and used as initial conditions
for the next step. This iterative procedure continues until the final values are determined. A similar
prescription is employed in deriving the standard Boltzmann equations based on the Born-Markov
approximation.
To simplify the equations further, we separate the real and imaginary parts of variable λ as
λ = ξ + iη.

where ξ and η are real numbers. This leads to the following set of equations:

For example, during the radiation dominant era, we have a′/a = 1/x.

Flat Background
While the above formulation applies to a general FLRW background, we first consider a simple
Minkowski background to examine the physical properties of graviton emission. In the Minkowski
