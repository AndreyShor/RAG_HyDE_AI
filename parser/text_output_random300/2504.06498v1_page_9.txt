Conclusion
In analogy to conventional lasers, the coherent signal generated by 𝐽-oscillators presented in this
work significantly boosts resolution in spectroscopy by achieving exceptionally narrow linewidths.
Furthermore, due to intrinsic insensitivity of 𝐽-coupling constants to magnetic field drifts, these
zero-field 𝐽-oscillators exhibit superior long-term frequency stability in comparison to conven-
tional NMR rasers. The selective resonance amplification capability (on-demand spectral editing)
provided by zero-field 𝐽- oscillators enables individual transitions to be excited and resolved, even
when spectra are composed of densely overlapped resonances. By increasing the external feedback
gain, polarization threshold required for the oscillator operation was effectively lowered. Applica-
tion of quantum oscillators was demonstrated on a diverse range of molecules, even in samples
with natural isotopic abundance. By operating directly at zero magnetic field, these quantum oscil-
lators are uniquely positioned to measure 𝐽-couplings with precision inaccessible by conventional
high-field NMR techniques. The presented advancements substantially broaden the practical scope
of zero-field NMR, opening exciting avenues of inquiry across a range of disciplines including an-
alytical chemistry, biomolecular characterization and imaging, and the exploration of fundamental
physical phenomena.
