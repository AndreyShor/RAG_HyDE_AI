Consider the problem in the self-similar coordinates ξ = (ξ1, ξ2) in the region:
Λ = R2
+ \

ξ : ξ2 > max(0, ξ1 tan θw)
	
.
We seek global entropy solutions of the boundary value problem in the sense of Definition 2.2.
First, a similar argument as made for the regular shock reflection at the reflection point P0 (see
Figs. 4.1–4.2) yields that, at wedge-vertex P1, for a given uniform incoming flow (ρ∞, v∞), there
is a detachment angle θd
w ∈(0, π
2 ) such that the system of algebraic equations (2.9) and (2.13) for
state (O) has two solutions for each wedge-angle θw ∈(0, θd
w) such that the entropy condition
is satisfied for the two-shock configuration.
The weak state (O) with the smaller density is
expected to be physical. So we always refer to state (O) as the weak state (O). Similarly, it
follows from the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions (2.9) and the slip boundary condition (2.13) that
The shock line ΓO
shock between states (O) and (∞) is not parallel to Γwedge for all θw ∈(0, θd
w).

Depending on the wedge-angle, state (O) can be either supersonic or subsonic at P1. It de-
termines the type of the reflection, supersonic or subsonic, as shown in Fig. 4.5 and Fig. 4.6,
respectively.
Second, by a straightforward computation, we know that there exists a unique constant state
(N), which determines the normal reflection of state (∞) from the wedge boundary Γwedge so that
state (N) satisfies the slip boundary condition (2.13) along Γwedge and the Rankine-Hugoniot
conditions (2.9) along a straight line ΓN
shock, which lies in Λ and is parallel to Γwedge.
Hinted by the solution structures given in [2,3,26] for the potential flow, for any given wedge-
angle θw ∈(0, θd
w), an entropy solution (ρ, v) of the boundary value problem in the sense of
Definition 2.2 is called a regular Prandtl-Meyer reflection solution for the isentropic Euler system
(2.3)–(2.4) if (ρ, v) satisfies the following further properties:
(i) If state (O) at P1 is supersonic, i.e., |vO(P1)| > cO, the solution has the supersonic reflection
structure as in Fig. 4.5 at point P1. If state (O) at P1 is subsonic or sonic, i.e., |vO(P1)| ≤
cO, the solution has the subsonic reflection structure as in Fig. 4.6.
(ii) The reflected shock curve Γshock (i.e., P4P5 for the supersonic reflection and P1P4 for the
subsonic reflection) is C1 up to its endpoints and is C2 in its relative interior.
(iii) (ρ, v) is continuous in Ω∩Nr(Γshock ∪ΓN
sonic ∪ΓO
sonic) when |vO(P1)| > cO, and in Ω∩
Nr(Γshock ∪ΓN
sonic) when |vO(P1)| ≤cO for some r > 0.
(iv) The solution coincides with states (∞), (O), and (N) in their respective regions. Specifi-
