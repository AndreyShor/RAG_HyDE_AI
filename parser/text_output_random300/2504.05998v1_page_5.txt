Conclusions— We introduced the concept of GIT, i.e., an
effective optical transmission line induced by gravity be-
tween two independent optomechanical systems.
We pro-
posed model-independent protocols for indirectly assessing
the non-classicality of the gravitational interaction by test-
ing the non-classicality of the GIT channel.
For the spe-
cific model of a quadratic gravitational potential, the gravity-
induced channel reduces to a thermal attenuator that can be
completely characterized analytically.
By framing the question about the quantum nature of grav-
ity as a non-classicality test for a quantum optical channel, the
problem is significantly simplified both conceptually and ex-
perimentally. However, the experimental implementation of
the approach proposed in this work remains very challenging.
The reason is that, to our knowledge, all existing optomechan-
ical devices operate in what we called "classical region" of the
parameter space (see Fig. 2). Testing the GIT channel in the
quantum regime requires developing new extraordinary de-
vices with low mechanical frequencies and ultra-high quality
factors. The remarkable history of gravitational-weave inter-
ferometers demonstrates that similar technological endeavors
are possible.
In the short term, it would still be valuable to experimen-
tally demonstrate even a classical instance of the GIT phe-
nomenon for several reasons.
First, it would represent an
important technological milestone toward the ideal quantum
regime. Second, classical GIT may be of interest also within
the context of classical weak-gravity experiments at the mi-
croscopic scale [36, 44]. Third, even in the classical regime,
one might indirectly extrapolate the ideal results achievable
in the quantum regime. For example, one could evaluate the
input-output average fidelity F of the GIT channel (see Sec-
tion Experimental protocols) at different temperatures and ex-
trapolate an estimate of F at T = 0. An extrapolated value
larger than Fclassical would provide indirect evidence for the
quantum nature of gravity, even if not as compelling as a di-
rect experiment in the quantum regime. Additionally, a dif-
ferent type of short-term experiment may be obtained by re-
placing the gravitational interaction with the Coulomb inter-
action between two charged mechanical degrees of freedom
[31]. Demonstrating a non-classical optical channel induced
by a Coulomb interaction would constitute a proof-of-concept
milestone towards the ideal gravitational experiment.
