in the present study, we analyzed the HS properties
in a range of m = 300 MeV to m = 390 MeV. The
description of the hadronic phase was done by means
of a particular parameterization of a relativistic mean-
field model, namely, NL3* [46], that was shown to de-
scribe low-energy nuclear physics data while also align-
ing with certain astrophysical observations related to
neutron stars [60]. For the deconfinement hadron-quark
we use the Maxwell construction in first order phase
transitions. We solved the TOV equations with appro-
priate boundary conditions, and the equations of radial
oscillation to determine the stable regions on the MR
diagram considering slow interface conversions.
The main outcome is that it is possible to have a
stable HS with a core of quark matter consistent with
the recent NICER +XMM-Newton observational data.
Indeed, in Fig. 3, the MR relation for a set of param-
eters was compared against pulsars observational data.
We show that the stable hybrid star maximum mass
increases with the constituent quark mass. In all six pa-
rameterizations, the HS maximum mass is higher than
2 solar masses, aligning with the analysis of the observa-
tional data of the pulsars PSR J0740+6620 [54,55], PSR
J1614-2230 [74] and PSR J0348+0432 [75]. Our calcu-
lations also illustrate that reaching 2.7 solar masses is
achievable. The obtained M(R) sequence of HS falls
within the 95% confidence level data analysis from the
recent work of the NICER + XMM-Newton collabora-
tion of the pulsar PSR J0740+6620 [73] and from the
NICER collaborations of the milisecond pulsars PSR
J0740+6620 [54,55,76] and PSR J0030+0451 [56,57].
In Table 2 we can see the masses and radii of the
quark core for hybrid stars of 2.2 solar masses. Raising
the constituent quark mass leads to an increase in the
quark core mass while reducing the radius. This means
that the core becomes more compact. The same result
can be seen when the pressure profile is analyzed, see
Fig. 4, where the hadron-quark interfaces can be iden-
tified in each case.
A desirable improvement to the holographic model
would be incorporating the breaking of the SU(3) flavor
symmetry in the quark phase. This would account for
up, down, and strange quarks having distinct masses.
Additionally, the model should include the presence of
electrons to ensure beta equilibrium and electric charge
neutrality in the quark sector.
