Appendix A: Description of Experimental Setup
The device tests described in the main text are the
result of substantial trial and error with cryogenic fiber
optics, which we endeavor to document in this appendix
section.
In particular, designing broad-band cryogenic
fiber optics with low enough loss to perform loop-back
measurements was more difficult than anticipated.

Optical Throughput Testing - Details
The use of optical fiber for cryogenic measurements
is not a novel concept (see e.g.
Refs [9, 13, 16, 17]).
However, previous experiments in our group had always
focused on delivery of a highly attenuated photon beam
to single-photon sensitive readout, or at most replicating
keV-scale energies with optical energies. In the past we
relied on having a fiber break at each thermal stage, plus
an optical filter at the cold plate stage, to reduce the mW-
scale energy at room temperature to pW-scale pulses at
10 mK. This filtering also served to block 300 K radiation
from reaching the payload.
For this measurement, we needed to first demonstrate
that we can transmit an optical signal from 300 K to
10 mK and back without losses generating substantial
heating at the base stage of the dilution refrigerator
(DR). Our typical fiber setups used vacuum compati-
ble fibers (UV/VIS or IR/VIS depending on the applica-
tion) from AccuGlass with a 105 µm core and a PEEK
jacket.
The fibers were installed with breaks at every
stage, which contributed non-trivial losses. As a basis for
comparison, we had Oxford install long, unbroken multi-
mode fibers without explicit breaks from 300 K to the
base stage, which were delivered with our cryostat. Our
intent was to characterize the loss from having multiple
breaks as a function of fridge temperature.
We initially used Thorlabs fiber-coupled LEDs and a
PM16-130 USB optical power meter to measure fiber
throughput at a handful of optical wavelengths between
280 and 990 nm.
These LEDs are generally rated for
about 1 mW ouput into a 200 µm core multimode fiber,
with variations depending on the LED wavelength. Di-
rect coupling of a 200 µm fiber into the power meter
yielded ∼1.7 mW for an equivalent driving current of
1 A in constant current mode. Using this result as the
reference value for zero loss showed that we got a reason-
ably high coupling efficiency into the 200 µm fibers we
use for coupling to 300 K, relative to the expected power
levels for these diodes.
Our initial warm round-trip measurements through
the Oxford-installed fibers showed ∼7.2 µW/A round-
trip transmission at 300 K, which quickly went to zero
upon cooldown.
In comparison, the typical Accuglass
chain, which includes of order 11 SMA connections in-
