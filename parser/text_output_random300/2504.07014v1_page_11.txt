The scaling (27,28) for d = 3 agrees with the original result due to Lifshitz [18], reported
for a generic spectrum (i.e., for a generic FS). The response χ◦→0 at µ →µc ± 0, and the
transition is of the third order with the divergent P ′′′(µ) ∝(µ −µc)−1/2 according to the
Ehrenfest classification [18].
In two dimensions γ = α = 0. The density response undergoes a finite discontinuity
between the incompressible gapped and the metallic phases, χ◦∝Θ(µ−µc), implying again
the third order transition with P ′′′(µ) ∝δ(µ −µc).
In one dimension the transition is of the second kind with divergent susceptibilities χ◦∝
C ∝(µ −µc)−1/2. The ladder model studied in this work and the modulated XX chain in
transverse field are in the same universality class as the 1d Fermi gas.

Interactions: Tomonaga-Luttinger and Fermi liquids
So far we did not discuss the important role of interactions in the proposed framework.
For interacting models the partition functions are unavailable in general, with the exception
of handful solvable cases.
Although two paradigmatic examples of interacting fermionic
systems (Tomonaga-Luttinger and Fermi liquids) can be straightforwardly incorporated in
our analysis.
In 1d an arbitrarily weak repulsion is known to destroy the free-gas description (Fermi
liquid theory, FLT) [46]. The low-energy sector of the interacting 1d fermions can be mapped
onto the Hamiltonian of the free massless scalar boson field, yielding the gapless Tomonaga-
Luttinger liquid (TLL). The bosonic partition function Z is readily available [46], and the
poles of Z signal that the left/right Fermi momenta are the points of quantum criticality at
T = 0, the same result as for free fermions.
Due to the Luttinger theorem the volume of the d-dimensional Fermi sea does not change
by interactions [47]. From the rigorous results relating the interacting thermodynamic po-
tential (Ω) and the exact temperature Green’s function [48, 49], the average particle density
is:

The above equation along with the expression for the thermodynamic potential which con-
tains (under summation and integration) the term ∝ln G(k, ωn) [48, 49], imply that the
zeros of the inverse exact Green’s function (cf. (B4)) define the interacting FS at T = 0,
and the latter is the quantum critical manifold where Ωhas a non-analyticity. The FS cannot
be interpreted anymore as a (d−1)-dimensional membrane in the d-dimensional momentum
space which separates the occupied and empty states of the interacting particles, since their
distribution nF(k) is not a step-function: nF(k) ̸= 0 at k > kF, it has a discontinuity Z < 1
at kF (d = 2, 3), which becomes just an essential singulary in 1d, since the residue of the
fermionic Green’s function Z vanishes [46, 49].
Thus, appearance of the FS is a quantum transition in the liquid of interacting fermions.
The FS corresponds to the special points of the partition function Z where Ωhas non-
analyticity, this (d −1)-dimensional membrane preserves the volume inside it, although
becomes penetrable, and it is a locus on the gapless modes.
The renormalization-group (RG) analysis of the low-energy effective action of interacting
fermions in d = 2, 3 with isotropic spectrum at T ̸= 0, demonstrates that the Landau Fermi
liquid is robust, proviso that the Pomeranchuk stability conditions are satisfied [50]. Note
that the limit T →0 in the RG equations is subtle, and the whole FLT can be missed if the
RG flow is attempted to be traced directly at T = 0 [51]. The narrow angular anomalies in
