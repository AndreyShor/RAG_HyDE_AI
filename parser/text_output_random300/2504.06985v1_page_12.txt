Table 1.
All possible boundary conditions for an M-theory end of the world brane with gauge
algebra G2. Each spectrum is accompanied by the factorized twelve-dimensional anomaly polynomial
compatible with M-theory.
In the last column, we also provide the four-form G4 of M-theory to
establish a precise connection, similar to the E8 case by using (2.6). All of these solutions can be
obtained by simply restricting the spectrum of the E8 Hoˇrava-Witten wall to different G2 subgroups,
and as such, none of these boundary conditions is genuinely new.
in table 1. An example is
(n1 = 102, n7 = 13, n14 = 2, n27 = 1),

The mismatch is in the fact that the anomaly polynomial cannot be written in terms of a
single G4 (at least two independent four-forms would be needed, in contradiction with M-
theory), as well as in the coefficient of the pure gravitational anomaly. Whether or not this
anomaly polynomial has a home somewhere in the non-supersymmetric string Landscape
remains uncertain, but it certainly cannot be in the M-theory corner.
