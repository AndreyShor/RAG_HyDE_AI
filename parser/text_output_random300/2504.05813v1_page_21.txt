Figure 7. Top-left panel: Values of the PBH mass at the time of formation of the PBH. The different
colors denote the type of PBH formed, and the symbols represent the profile: β = 1 (circle), β = 3
(crosses). Top-right panel: Time evolution of the PBH mass for different cases of µ −µc. The dotted
lines represent the numerical fit to Eq. (5.1). Bottom-left panel: Final values of the PBH mass MPBH
after the accretion process from the FLRW background for different cases. Bottom-right panel: Time
evolution of the averaged Hamiltonian constraint.
Following our new approach, we have developed a simple and efficient numerical code
based on the numerical method used in [17], employing a pseudospectral collocation approach.
Using this code, we successfully simulated the evolution and collapse of super-horizon type-II
curvature fluctuations, for what we have done a detailed study of the dynamics of the gravi-
tational collapse for three representative cases using standard exponential-shaped curvature
profiles Eq.(3.15). Our results agree with those reported in [41] for the case of β = 1 when
compared. Therefore, our work demonstrates that the Misner-Sharp formalism with the co-
moving gauge does not present any issues for simulating type-II fluctuations. Rather, type-II
simulations can be effectively conducted by avoiding divergent terms, which we achieved in
this work by using K.
By implementing a bisection method, we determined the threshold for black hole for-
mation for both type A and type B PBHs.
Notably, we identify cases in which type-II
fluctuations do not necessarily lead to black hole formation. Specifically, we find that the
threshold transitions into the type-II region at approximately β ≈2.5. Furthermore, we show
