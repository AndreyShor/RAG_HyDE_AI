2.1
The down-type quark mass matrices
We explain the construction of the mass matrices for the down-type quarks mostly in the case
of the type A1 in this paper. The constructions for the A2 and A3 are very similar to that for
this case.
We have four zeros in the mass matrix M 0 (A1)
d
which is
M 0 (A1)
d
=


0
a
0
a′
0
c
a′′
0
d

,
(2)
where a, a′, a′′, c and d are real parameters, since we assume the CP invariance at the funda-
mental level. All Dirac type mass matrices M in this paper is written as MLR form in [2].
We now generate spontaneous breaking of the CP invariance introducing two complex scalar
bosons η and η′ whose Z2 charges are odd(−). They are assumed to have complex vevs at
an intermediate scale ∼1012 GeV. Note that the presence of two vevs, < η > and < η′ > is
necessary to break both of CP and the flavor Z2 symmetries 5. (See [1] for details about the
breaking mechanism.)
We have two ways to localize the η and η′ on the fixed points to obtain two zeros textures.
One is to localize both on the fixed point I, and the other is to localize one on the fixed point II
and the other on the fixed point III. But the former does not work and hence a successful mass
matrix for the down-type quarks is given by,
M (A1)
d
=


0
a
0
a′
κ < η >
c
a′′
κ′ < η′ >
d

,

where the η and η′ terms are induced by heavy Higgs, HI and HII exchanges, respectively, as
shown in [1]. The κ = (f/M 2
I ) < H† > and κ′ = (f ′/M 2
II) < H† >. Here f and f ′ are real
dimension-one effective coupling constants, and MI and MII are the masses of the heavy Higgs
5The spontaneous breaking produces domain walls in the early universe. However, they are diluted by the
inflation.
