Model.—We illustrate the principle of the evanescent
orbital pumping using the Luttinger model [25, 26]. To
this end, we take the prototypical semiconductors such
as Ge and Si [66, 67] as examples, which contain three
degenerate p-orbitals at the Γ point of valence bands.
Disregarding the weak SOC [24, 25], we adopt a spherical
approximation for the Luttinger model, resulting in an
effective Hamiltonian of electrons with wave vector k [24]
H0(k) = Ak2 −r(k · I)2,

where the coefficients A and r are given in the L¨owdin
partitioning theory [26, 69–71] and the OAM matrices

The helicity ek · I along the propagation direction ek =
sin ϕk cos θkˆx + cos ϕkˆy + sin ϕk sin θkˆz commutes with
H0 and is thereby conserved. Among the three valence
bands, two bands “a” and “b” are degenerate with dis-
persions εa/b(k) = (A −r)k2, and the third one, de-
noted by “c”, has a dispersion εc(k) = Ak2.
The ef-
fective masses of the heavy and light holes associated
with these bands are mh
a = mh
b = ℏ2/|2(A −r)| and
mh
c = ℏ2/|2A|.

volume and
φa,k = (−cos ϕk sin θk, sin ϕk, −cos ϕk cos θk)T ,
φb,k = (cos θk, 0, −sin θk)T ,
φc,k = (sin ϕk sin θk, cos ϕk, sin ϕk cos θk)T ,

are the eigenstates of the matrix (1) [72]. Correspond-
ingly, including the chemical potential µ of holes, the hole
Hamiltonian is expressed as [72]

where ˆhα,k (ˆh†

We consider the coupling of electron orbitals to an ex-
ternal magnetic field H(r, t) that is emitted by, e.g., the
magnetization dynamics of magnetic nanostructures [47,
73] or an antenna. In this case, the electric field is negli-
gible in the magnetic radiation. By the Kohn-Luttinger
transcription ℏk →ℏˆK = (ℏ/i)∇−eA [25, 26, 69],
the commutator of momentum operators [ ˆKa, ˆKb] =
iϵabcµ0eHc/ℏ, where µ0 is the vacuum permeability and
ϵabc is the antisymmetric tensor, generates an additional
Zeeman coupling ˆHint(r) = (µ0µB/ℏ)H(r, t) · LLL between
electron orbitals and external magnetic field [refer to the
Supplementary Material (SM) [72] for details] [26, 69],
in which the effective OAM matrix Lα = (m0D/ℏ2)Iα.
Here, m0 is the mass of free electrons, µB = |e|ℏ/(2m0)
is the Bohr magneton, and D is another material co-
efficient governed by the band mixing [26, 72].

h(k) = −(U †(−k)LU(−k))T is the OAM carried by

transformation U(k) = (φa,k, φb,k, φc,k). ˜L
h(k) depends
strongly on the wave-vector direction, giving rise to an
orbital texture in the k space, which plays an impor-
tant role in the orbital Hall effect [24, 34]. The OAM
derived from the Kohn-Luttinger transcription in the
k · p Hamiltonian includes both the atomic and itiner-
ant contributions, consistent with the general definition
of OAM [30, 31, 68, 74–76]. The Zeeman coupling to hole
spin is weaker than the orbitals.
When the AC magnetic field H(r, t) = H(+)(r)e−iωt +
H(−)(r)eiωt is monochromatic with frequency ω, the Zee-
