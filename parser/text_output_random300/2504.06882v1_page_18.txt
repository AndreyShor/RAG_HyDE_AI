The reduced K group eK(M9) is isomorphic to Z2

ν(4)

Here, the sub-manifolds X1, X2 and the oriented segments S±
1 , S±
2 are illustrated in Fig. S6(c). We take the boundaries
of X1 to be fixed in the planes kx = 0 and kx = −π respectively. Thus, X1 has the topology of a Klein bottle imposed
by the screw rotation symmetry Ry, and we can check that the oriented segment S+
1 generates the boundary ∂X1
under the action of D2. Therefore, the invariant ν(4)
1
is of a similar form to the one for the k-space Pna21.
A similar argument holds for X2 and ν(4)
2 , since it also has the topology of a Klein bottle imposed by the screw
rotation symmetry Rz. And the two boundaries of X2 are fixed in the planes kz = 0 and kz = −π respectively.

Equivalence relations between topological invariants
In the previous section, we presented the construction of topological invariants for each classification. Obviously,
there may be several different ways to define equivalent topological invariants. In this section, we take three examples
to illustrate the equivalent relationships between topological invariants. This will include the cases discussed earlier.
Example 1: Second amphicosm M2
First, reviewing the case of k-space Cc, it appears that we can define a Z2 invariant over X, as illustrated in Fig.
S7(a). Through a continuous deformation, indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. S7(a), the sub-manifold X can be
deformed into X1 + X2, as shown in Fig. S7(b).
Thus, we can also define the Z2 invariant as:
ν(2) = 1
2π
Z
X1+X2
f −1
π
Z
S+
1 +S+
2
a
mod 2.
(S76)
Here, the oriented segment S+
1 + S+
2 serves as the fundamental domain ∂(X1 + X2)/B2. Next, we focus on the
sub-manifold X1 + X2 + M, considering the periodicity of reciprocal space:
1
2π
Z
X1+X2+M
f −1
π
Z
S+
1 +S+
2
a = 0
mod 2.
(S77)
A straightforward derivation then gives:
Ch = 1
2π
Z
M
f = −ν(2)
mod 2.
(S78)
In conclusion, ν(2) here is equivalent to the parity of the Chern number.
