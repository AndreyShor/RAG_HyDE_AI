Figure 2: DI-QKD and Bell’s Theorem — only by the observed correlations p from two causal cones in Fig. 2a, the security
of DI-QKD is tested by BI determining if p ̸∈L (see Sec. 2). Self-testing may also be possible, a time retrodictive process
that infers the inputs x, y, ρ from p [49]. Figure 2b shows the tolerance level p in a Werner state ρ required to witness
nonlocality, along with the visibility in a specific ˜p across the different regions L, Q, and NS in the space of correlations
of Fig. 2c-2d. η∗in Fig. 2d is the critical detection efficiency, if η < η∗then ̸ ∃BI to assert p ∈Q \ L. In Sec. 2 we will
introduce the behaviour pNL, a.k.a. PR box.
