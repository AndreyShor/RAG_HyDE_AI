We developed local, semi-local, and semi-global visual-
ization techniques of arbitrary two-dimensional torsion
fields in both purely spatial and spacetime contexts, and
then focused on the special case of constant torsion co-
efficients. There, we found a maximal set of three au-
toparallel Killing vectors and showed that they satisfy a
deformed Poincar´e algebra under the torsionful commu-
tator [•, •]T. Motivated by the emergence of such a struc-
ture, we extracted the generalized boost generator from
this algebra and used it to define two notions of surface
gravity in the presence of torsion in two spacetime di-
mensions. Finally, we studied under what conditions the
two-dimensional results can be lifted to four-dimensional
spacetime. As it turns out, these conditions on the tor-
sion coefficients are rather restrictive and exclude several
known black hole configurations encountered in the liter-
ature, but the plethora of different gravitational models,
especially in the teleparallel sector, may prove surprising
in the future.
Besides the technical details, a central outcome of this
work is the following: in the presence of torsion, it is pos-
sible to define a notion of an autoparallel Killing vector
ξµ that solves
∇µξν + ∇νξµ = 0 .

While at face value this has nothing to do with isome-
tries (which are always defined in terms of the Lie deriva-
tive, and can be suitable generalized to the case of non-
vanishing torsion [28]), the set of autoparallel Killing
vectors found in this paper still satisfies a deformed
Poincar´e algebra.
This seemingly connects those au-
toparallel Killing vectors to fundamental isometric prop-
erties of the underlying spacetime. It remains to be seen
if (and how) these results can be generalized to other sce-
narios of physical interest in the strong-gravity regime.
