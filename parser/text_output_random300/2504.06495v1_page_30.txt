Under this approximation, we compute eµ = −E[log ∆t] = 1 and σ2 = Var[log ∆t] =

12.
Remember also our choice α = e−11/12. Substituting into the formula for β from Section 4.1,
we ﬁnd that:
β = eµ + log α
σ2
= 1.
Equation (22) then follows as a direct consequence of Theorem 2, assuming that the approx-
imation ∆t ∼i.i.d. U[0, 1] is suﬃciently accurate.
Although the branching structure in this model is binary (K = 2), the transition mul-
tipliers ∆t still take on a wide range of values. This variability does not arise from any
external randomness, but from the evolution of the internal state variable ct, which diﬀers
across branches and inﬂuences the branching dynamics. Conceptually, this reﬂects the fact
that φt is not the full state of the system, but merely one scalar function of the quantum
state vector ψt, whose evolution is governed by the Schr¨odinger equation. The full quantum
state vector ψt is a high-dimensional object encoding all physical degrees of freedom relevant
to the multiverse evolution. In our stylized model here, the variable ct serves as a simple
proxy for part of this internal structure. It determines the precise branching ratios at each
step and evolves recursively along each path. This added complexity of the internal state
ensures that the branching dynamics unfold in a much richer way — though still entirely
within a deterministic framework.
Remarks on the continuous time model
The continuous-time model introduced in (18) can be interpreted as an approximation of the
discrete-time stochastic process (14), especially when we consider the evolution of the logged
and rescaled process Xt over long time horizons. This connection is motivated by a classical
insight from probability theory: under suitable conditions, the scaled sum of independent
(or weakly dependent) random variables converges in distribution to Brownian motion — a
result formalized by the functional central limit theorem (Donsker’s invariance principle).
Recall that in the discrete-time model, above the barrier, the process Xt evolves according
to
Xt = Xt−1 −µ + σUt,
