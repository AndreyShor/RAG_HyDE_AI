By observing that the product on the first line is bounded away from zero uniformly in k and b, the
conclusion follows from Proposition A.9 with s = k.
Appendix B
Proof of Lemma 7.10
In this appendix, we verify that, for any λ > 0 and A, L, b ≥0, the function Fλ
A,L,b : R × C(Rd) →R
defined in (7.29) satisfies conditions (1) – (4) of Lemma 7.10. To simplify the notation, we prove the
case λ = 1 and note that the general case, where λ > 0, follows with straightforward modifications.
To streamline the presentation, only in this appendix, for any g ∈C(Rd) and η ≥0, we let
Dg(η)
def= {y ∈Bb : Υb,g(y) ≥M0,b(Υb,g) −η} .
We note that if 0 ≤η1 ≤η2, then Dg(η1) ⊆Dg(η2).
Proof of Lemma 7.10. Fix λ = 1. We begin by defining the functions h : R →R+ and F∗: C(Rd) →
R+ as follows

We observe that (1) follows immediately from the definition of h, while (2) is an immediate consequence
of Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. Hence, it remains to verify that (3) and (4) are satisfied.
Regarding condition (3), we fix δ ∈(0, 1) and g ∈C(Rd) such that
sup
x,y∈Rd, |x−y|≤δ
|g(x) −g(y)| ≤1/4 .
(B.1)
We define the random radius r ≥0 as the largest radius for which all of the following conditions hold:
1. There exists x ∈Bb for which B(x, r) ⊆Bb and Υb,g(x) = M0,b(Υb,g).
2. For all y ∈B(x, r), it holds that Υb,g(y) ≥M0,b(Υb,g) −1/2.
For δ > 0 and letting S be the volume of the unit ball, we observe that
F∗(g)4 ≤S−8⌈1/δ⌉8d +

k=⌈1/δ⌉
S−8(k + 1)8dE[1{S/(k+1)d≤e−db|Dg(1/2)|<S/kd}] .
For k ∈N such that k ≥⌈1/δ⌉, we note that e−db|Dg(1/2)| ≤S/kd implies that r ≤eb/k < ebδ. On
this event, we know that there exists z ∈Bb with |x−z| ≤eb/k such that Υb,g(z) < M0,b(Υb,g)−1/2.
In turn, this implies that
|Υb,g(x) −Υb,g(z)| ≥1
2 =⇒|Yb(e−bx) −Yb(e−bz)| ≥1
2 −|g(x) −g(z)| .
In particular, recalling that we are assuming (B.1), for all k ∈N such that k ≥⌈1/δ⌉, it holds that
