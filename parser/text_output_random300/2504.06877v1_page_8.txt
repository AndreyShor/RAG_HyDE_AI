Figure 3: Admittance of a static symmetric Josephson junction. The temperature of
the superconducting leads is (a, b) kBTs = 0.04∆Σ, (c, d) kBTs = 0.32∆Σ.
where we have omitted the superscript “c” for brevity and explicitly separated the weak probe
voltage vp(t) from the sum of the dc phase bias and the phase coming from the drive
ϕd(t) = ϕ0 + 2eV0
ħhΩsin(Ωt).

To obtain the admittance, we linearize Eq. (11) with respect to vp(t) and omit the noise terms.

Admittance of a static junction
First, we analyze a simpler case of absent drive V0 = 0. In this case, the current is given by

The first term corresponds to the dc Josephson current. The Fourier image of the admittance
reads as
