Of course the sample paths X(t) themselves are not differentiable in t, but conditional
expectations save the day, defining

and Nelson’s stochastic analogue of acceleration,
a(X(t), t) = 1
2(D+D−+ D−D+)X(t),
D±X(t) = b±(X(t), t),
D+X(t) = b(X(t), t) = ∇(R + S)(X(t), t),
b(X(t), t) the drift in our diffusion, and
D−X(t) = b(X(t), t) −ϵ2∇ln ρ(X(t), t).
He defines osmotic velocity u and current velocity v by

v = 1

Elementary vector algebra then yields (what at first looks like the somewhat
impenetrable result)

But from equating the real parts of (SE) above one obtains,
