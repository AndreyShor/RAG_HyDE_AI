with fixed x ∈{0, 1} and e determined by the values of z that chooses the strategies {vi} = {ℓr
j, pNL}.
This is the first evidence of an analogue of quantum mechanical uncertainty relations in a generic no-
signalling theory. The pseudosifting is optimized to extract correlations from the nonlocal strategy pNL,
but the pseudosifting has another action on deterministic strategies. Specifically, for ℓr
1 and ℓr
2, after
pseudosifting we have no error, and Eve knows b for x = 0 since b(y)|y=0 = b(y)|y=1 = a, but error in
half cases, and Eve is ignorant on b for x = 1 since b(y)|y=0 ̸= b(y)|y=1. The opposite scenario for ℓr
3 and
ℓr

3.4.1. Extraction of a secret key
Quantum cryptographic protocols utilize key metrics like the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) in Eq.
(4) and the secret key rate, which is based on information-theoretic quantities such as the mutual infor-
mation and Shannon entropy. The mutual information I(A : B) = H(A) −H(A|B) measures how much
information Bob can infer about Alice’s symbols, where H(X) = ⟨−log X⟩= −P
x p(x) log p(x) (binary
entropy h if x ∈{0, 1}) quantifies the uncertainty of a random variable X 13. Higher I(A : B) implies
less uncertainty for Bob, indicating better knowledge of Alice’s symbols. The secret key rate, expressed
in bits per measurement round, reflects the secure bits generated per round that remain inaccessible to
eavesdroppers. In DI-QKD, this rate is influenced by factors like quantum channel error rates, noise,
and eavesdroppers’ potential information.
Achievable distances and key rates can be experimentally
estimated, as discussed in Sec. 1 and Sec. 6, and theoretical methods for estimation are presented below.
One-way classical postprocessing.
14 Under the assumption of individual and collective attacks, for one-
way classical postprocessing, the achievable secret key rate is bounded by the Devetak-Winter bound
(50) which we introduce here since we refer to it frequently through this paper
Devetak-Winter formula. One of the most important quantities for modern security proofs is the Deve-
tak–Winter rate [221], which gives a lower bound on the asymptotic secret key rate r. It proves that the
secret key rate, which is the rate at which secure keys can be generated, is determined by the difference
between the mutual information shared by the legitimate parties (Alice and Bob) and the information
that an eavesdropper (Eve) could gain
r ≥I(A : B) −I(A : E) = H(A|E) −H(A|B),
(50)
This equation rigorously shows that the key distribution remains secure even when Eve has full access to
the quantum channel, as long as the secret key rate remains positive. The generalized Devetak-Winter
formula incorporating preprocessing and postprocessing is given by:
r ≥sup
T,F
[S(A′|E′) −S(A′|B′)] ,
(51)
where T represents preprocessing operations such as local operations, quantum filtering, encoding, or
advantage distillation, while F represents postprocessing operations like error correction, privacy ampli-
fication, and interactive communication. The modified systems after preprocessing are denoted as A′ and
B′, while E′ represents Eve’s modified system after considering preprocessing effects.
To compute the key rate, the so-called depolarization procedure transform w.l.o.g. Eve’s strategy of Eq.
(46) into the isotropic distribution pE = pL1 + pNLpNL with pr
j = pL/8. Given that, the probability
distributions in Eq. (48) p(ab|x = 0, y = k) = p(ab|x = 1, y = k) = P
e p(abe|X = x, Y = k, z = pE), and
the tripartite probability distribution reads
p(abe|0, k, pE) =

The information flow goes from Alice to Bob and from the distribution in (52) Bob’s error probability
is ϵB = pL/4, after preprocessing, the quantity to be corrected in error correction is e′
AB = (1 −q)eAB +
q(1 −eAB) while Eve’s information is I(A : E) = pL/2(1 −h(q)). Therefore Eq. (50) yields
13The surprise function f : p ∈[0, 1] 7→−log p so called because for a rare event limp→0 f(p) = ∞and for a certain event
limp→1 f(p) = 0.
14It refers to a communication process where information flows only in one direction to minimize the opportunities for
eavesdropping and information leakage, simplifying the communication process.
