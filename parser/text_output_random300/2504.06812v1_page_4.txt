If C = Q, then both
inequalities become equalities.
In particular, Eq. (17)
can be tightened by maximizing the lower bound and
minimizing the upper bound over POVMs {Eω}.
The left-hand inequality in Eq. (17) is derived by using
C ≤Q and Q = FQ + iG.
To obtain the right-hand

Imaginary part of the SCGT.— For pure states, the
imaginary part of the QGT is reformulated as
G(|ψθ⟩) = −2Ω(|ψθ⟩),
(18)
where Ω(|ψθ⟩) is the Berry curvature, with elements
Ωij = ∂iAj −∂jAi, and A ≡A(|ψθ⟩) is the Berry connec-
tion with Aj ≡i ⟨ψθ|∂jψθ⟩[7–9]. The form of Eq. (18)
can be checked by [G(|ψθ⟩)]ij = 4Im[⟨∂iψθ|∂jψθ⟩]. The
Berry curvature describes an eﬀective gauge ﬁeld in the
parameter space, analogous to a ﬁctitious magnetic ﬁeld
experienced during adiabatic evolution [59].
Let us write A = P
ω Aω with [Aω]j ≡i ⟨ψθ|Eω|∂jψθ⟩,
where A is a real vector but Aω is not a real vector due
to [Aω]∗
j = [Aω]j −i∂jpω(θ). Since the imaginary part of
the SCGT is [D(|ψθ⟩)]ij = 4Im[⟨∂iψθ|M(|ψθ⟩)|∂jψθ⟩], a
direct calculation leads to
D(|ψθ⟩) = −2i

(19)
where ∗, ⊤, and † respectively denote the complex conju-
gation, the transposition, and the Hermitian (conjugate
transpose). Using Eqs. (18, 19) and letting Ω= P
ω Ωω
with elements [Ωω]ij ≡∂i[Aω]j −∂j[Aω]i, we can express
the gap as ∆≡G −D = P
ω ∆ω, where ∆ω vanishes for
a rank-one POVM.
The integral of Ω(|ψθ⟩) over an oriented manifold S in
the parameter space is known as the Berry phase [7]:

[Ω(|ψθ⟩)]ijdθi ∧dθj,
(20)
where ∧is the wedge (or exterior) product and dθi ∧dθj
is an area element on S [11]. In particular, in the two-
dimensional parameter space (m = 2), the Gauss–Bonnet
theorem states that νQ = φQ/(2π) is always an integer,
known as the ﬁrst Chern number, which serves as a topo-
logical invariant [60–62].
In analogy to Eq. (20), we can introduce
φC ≡−1

i,j
[D(|ψθ⟩, {Eω})]ijdθi ∧dθj.
(21)
We have that φC = φQ for any rank-one POVM {Eω},
but φC ̸= φQ for general POVMs. Thus, νC ≡φC/(2π)
cannot always be an integer, because the Gauss–Bonnet
theorem cannot be applied in the integral at Eq. (21).
As an example, consider a single-qubit state with θ =
(ϑ, ϕ) for the intervals ϑ ∈[0, π] and ϕ ∈[0, 2π]: |ψθ⟩=
sin(ϑ/2) |0⟩+ eiϕ cos(ϑ/2) |1⟩, where |0⟩and |1⟩are the
eigenstates of the Pauli-z matrix with ±1 eigenvalues,
respectively. In this case, Ωϑ,ϕ = sin(ϑ)/2 and νQ = 1.
For the non-rank-one POVM with two outcomes {Eω =
ε |ω⟩⟨ω| + (1 −ε)1/2} for ω = 0, 1 and a parameter ε ∈
[0, 1], we obtain that νC(ε) = 1 −[(1/ε) −ε]arctanh(ε) ∈
[0, 1], where νC(ε) monotonically increases for ε. This
may suggest that νC can provide a lower bound to νQ in
general.
Conclusion.— In this manuscript, we have introduced
the concept of semi-classical geometric tensor (SCGT) as
a counterpart of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT)
that explicitly includes POVM operators. The SCGT is
gauge invariant and provides a lower bound to the QGT
for general mixed states. In particular, the QGT and the
SCGT coincide for pure states and rank-one POVMs,
under suitable conditions that we precisely characterize.
The SCGT proves a useful tool to derive both matrix
and scalar multiparameter quantum information bounds,
clarifying the gap between quantum and classical Fisher
information matrices.
Our results open several avenues for further research.
First, our ﬁndings may advance toward the characteriza-
tion of measurement incompatibility and the saturation
problem of the quantum Cramér-Rao bound in multi-
parameter quantum metrology [33, 34], recognized as a
relevant open problem in quantum information [63]. Sec-
ond, exploring the role of the SCGT or its real part could
provide fresh insights into quantum information science,
such as the theory of asymmetry [26] and operational
frameworks based on the quantum Fisher information in
thermodynamics [64] and quantum resource theories [65].
Also, our results may be extended beyond SLD operators,
and be related to generalized quantum speeds [66, 67]
and susceptibilities [68]. Finally, beyond the theoretical
interests of our ﬁndings, a practical challenge lies in the
direct accessibility of the SCGT or its indirect estimation
via experimental techniques.
