Clause, Horne, Shimony and Holt’s derivation of Bell’s theorem is stated
in theorem 1 as a upper bound on the correlation of two local variables. It
gives a necessary and suﬃcient condition on correlations for them to be local.
Theorem 1 (Bell). A box P is local if and only if CHSH(P) ≤2.
Cirel’son[8] later found an upper bound on the CHSH value that all quan-
tum correlations must obey. It is a necessary condition for correlations to be
achievable by quantum mechanics.
Theorem 2 (Cirel’son). If a box P can be implemented by quantum mechan-
ics, then CHSH(P) ≤2
√
2.
However, this condition is not suﬃcient. This was remedied by [16] who
found a necessary and suﬃcient condition on boxes for them to be quantum.
Theorem 3. A box P can be implemented by a quantum state if and only
if | arcsin Xxy + arcsin Xx¯y + arcsin X¯xy −arcsin X¯x¯y| ≤π. For any xy =
00, 01, 10, 11 where Xxy is deﬁned in deﬁnition 4.
The following box was introduced by Popescu and Rohrlich [18] as a
correlation achieving the maximal algebraic of 4 of the CHSH inequality. It
is at the core of the study of non-locality and is used in the proofs of many
of the results presented in this work.
Deﬁnition 5. The Popescu-Rohrlich box (PR-box) is described by the fol-
lowing probability distribution:
P P R(a, b|x, y) =
(
1/2
if a ⊕b = xy
0
otherwise.
The noisy symmetric (or isometric) PR-boxes are the boxes of the form
Pǫ = ǫP P R + (1 −ǫ)P P R.
where P P R is the anti-PR-box: P P R(ab|xy) = 1/2 if a ⊕b ̸= xy.
