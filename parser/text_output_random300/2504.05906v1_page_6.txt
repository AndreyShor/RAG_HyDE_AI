Fig. 2. Up and down spin energy eigenvalues for a 30-site 1D perfect chain for different values 
of ùë¢ and ùëî. A vertical line is drawn in each energy eigenvalue for clearer visualization. The 
energy eigenvalues for the two spin cases match exactly.    
For a more detailed understanding, in Fig. 3 we present the spin-dependent trans-
mission probabilities along with the corresponding spin polarization coefficient, con-
sidering different values of u and g under the half-filled band condition for a disorder-
free conductor. The results are organized in three columns: the first column displays 
the transmission probabilities for up-spin electrons, while the second column shows 
those for down-spin electrons. The third column illustrates the spin polarization coef-
ficients calculated from the respective transmission probabilities. 
In accordance with the eigenvalue spectra discussed previously in Fig. 2, the 
transmission spectra exhibit distinct resonant peaks. Each of these resonant transmis-
sion peaks directly corresponds to an energy eigenvalue of the bridging conductor, 
thereby offering a direct mapping between the energy eigenvalues and the transmis-
sion characteristics. In other words, the transmission spectrum effectively mirrors the 
underlying energy spectrum of the conductor.  
It is important to emphasize that the widths of these resonant transmission peaks 
are primarily governed by the strength of the coupling between the conductor and the 
electrodes. When the coupling is weak, the resonant peaks are extremely sharp and 
narrow, indicating well-defined energy levels. However, with increasing coupling 
strength, these peaks become progressively broader, reflecting stronger interactions
