ing). This is illustrated in Figure 2 for evolutionary models 7 and 9 (see Table 1). Model 7
is a standard solar model. Consequently, it shows deviations at the BCZ between the thermal
contribution in dashed orange and the total value in solid red. Model 9, including macroscopic
transport, shows a thermal contribution of the Ledoux discriminant (AT) almost equal to the
total value. The chemical composition proﬁle close to the BCZ is ﬁxed by reproducing simul-
taneously the surface lithium depletion and Ycz with macroscopic turbulence, as in Model 9.
Thus, we directly measure AT with the inversion. The opacity is then determined from the ra-
diative transfer equation. Thermal equilibrium is ensured by slightly altering the core so that
the proper energy amount is generated by the nuclear fusion reactions and the solar luminosity
reproduced.
Comparisons to theoretical opacity computations
After reconstruction, we get a “seismic” determination of the solar opacity between 0.35R⊙and
the base of the convective zone, providing a data-driven mean Rosseland opacity proﬁle in the
