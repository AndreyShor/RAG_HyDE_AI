surfaces of ∆sd/ωm and ∆c/ωm). In addition, we find
that the surface patterns of ∆sd/ωm corresponding to
the four cases of κa/ωm exhibit slightly difference. We
also find that the red-sideband resonance ∆sd/ωm = 1
corresponds to a relatively small χ/ωm, and the intersec-
tion lines associated with ∆sd/ωm = 1 have similar trend
for the four cases of κa/ωm.
Figures 3(a)-3(d) display the scaled effective coupling
strength Gsd/ωm as a function of ∆c/ωm and χ/ωm for
different values of κa/ωm.
Similar to the analysis in
Fig. 2, these plots are obtained under steady-state condi-
tions. As κa/ωm increases, the peak value of Gsd/ωm first
increases and then decreases, suggesting a nonmonotonic
dependence on κa/ωm.
Increasing χ/ωm will broaden
the range of ∆c/ωm corresponding to a nonzero Gsd/ωm,
allowing the coupling strength to take significant val-
ues over a wider range of detuning. This leads to the
possibility for entanglement generation within the blue
sideband-parameter region ∆c < 0. Additionally, we ob-
serve that in both the shallow red- and blue-sideband
parameter regions, the coupling strength first increases
with χ and then decreases. In these regions, selecting an
appropriate value of χ can effectively enhance the cou-
pling strength. Notably, the maximum of Gsd occurs near
the red-sideband resonance ∆sd/ωm = 1 show in Fig. 2,
emphasizing the importance of near-resonance conditions
for achieving strong optomechanical coupling.

ENHANCED GENERATION OF
OPTOMECHANICAL ENTANGLEMENT
In this section, we analyze the stability of the lin-
earized Kerr cavity optomechanical system, derive the
steady-state covariance matrix, and evaluate the gener-
ated optomechanical entanglement.
A.
Analyses of the stability of the system
For the linearized optomechanical system, its steady
state can be characterized by the Gaussian state. Since
the equation of motions for the displacement amplitudes
α(t) and β(t) are nonlinear, there may exist rich stabil-
ity in this system. In our following study of the optome-
chanical entanglement, we mainly focus on the single sta-
ble regime. Therefore, we choose the parameters such
that the steady-state displacement amplitudes αss and
βss have a single value. Meanwhile, we use the Routh-
Hurwitz criterion to confirm that this steady state solu-
tion is stable. The solution of the amplitudes αss and
βss is obtained by solving Eqs. (5). To further examine
the stability around this working point, we need to eval-
uate the equation of motion for the first-order moments.
To this end, we derive the Heisenberg equation for ˆa and
ˆb based on the linearized optomechanical Hamiltonian
ˆ˜Hsd. To include the dissipations and functuations, we
phenomenologically add both the dissipation term and
