with ∆(2, 2, 1) = 0, eqn. (1.3), with r = k = 2 (with action density of Figure 3). The analytical results
of eqn. (B.2) as the 8 moduli are varied fill the inside of the smooth curves shown (the boundary of
the region corresponds to varying the translational moduli only). As in Figure 2, the 85 configurations
appear to cover the moduli space of the constant-F solutions.

determined by the index theorem.
No new undetermined moduli appear in either the λ-
expansion on the tuned-T4, as we showed above in section 3.1, or in the ∆-expansion on the
detuned T4 as we showed in [1]. This is in stark contrast with the constant-F solutions on
the tuned-T4 with gcd(k, r) ̸= r, which we study next.

Moduli space of Q= r
N instantons on the tuned T4 with gcd(k, r) ̸= r
We now turn to the tuned T4 with ∆(k, r, ℓ) = 0, eqn. (1.3), but gcd(k, r) ̸= r. Here, in
contrast with section 3, we argue that among the solutions of the equations (2.18) defining
the moduli space of Q = r/N self-dual instantons, the constant-F solutions (2.7, 2.8) are a
set of measure zero.
