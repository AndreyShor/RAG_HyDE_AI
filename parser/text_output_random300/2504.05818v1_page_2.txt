one global coupling constant, it naturally makes us be-
lieve that mg may be the last piece to construct the hy-
brid spectrum. Thus, following the spirit of constituent
quark model, in this work, we treat gluon as a constituent
and take q¯qg hybrid as a three-body system. As our first
trial, we recalculate the spectra of low-lying hybrids in
the light sector with quantum number JP C = 1−+, where
the other model parameters are kept the same as the ones
adopted in meson spectra calculations. Furthermore, we
calculate their two body strong decays at leading order.
It shows that after taking mg ≈1
2mp as Schwinger mech-
anism gives [55–57] as the only additional parameter, our
results are very consistent with the corresponding ones
in our previous work [50], although the calculation meth-
ods on spectra are totally different.
As if it is just a
coincidence, we will make more verifications in different
systems in future works.
This work is organized as follows, after the introduc-
tion, a brief presentation of our model will be given in
Sec. II. Then the numerical results and relevant discus-
sions will be given in Sec. III. Finally, this work will end
up with a summary.

MODEL SETUP
After taking into account the gluon as a constituent,
under the framework of potential model, our treatment
on the hybrid then becomes a three-body problem like
baryon, whose coupling scheme can be given by Fig. 1.

FIG. 1: The coupling scheme of hybrid (left) and the inter-
action between quark and gluon (right). Here, in left panel,
the T-type solid lines means that quark and antiquark couple
first to form a (q¯q) cluster, then gluon couples to this cluster
to form the final hybrid.
We adopt the Gauss Expansion Method [58] for the
spectra calculations, which is proven very suitable in
treating few-body systems.
Then, for the q¯qg hybrid,
its Hamiltonian can be written as
ˆH =
ˆp2

+ ˆp2

2µq¯q,g
+ ˆVq¯q + ˆVqg + ˆV¯qg,
(1)
with ˆpa,b and µa,b being the relative momentum and re-
duced mass between a and b clusters, respectively. For
the interaction between q¯q, since we need to use the same
model parameters as in meson calculations, in coordinate
representation, this potential keeps the same as chiral
constituent quark model as [1, 4, 5]

explicitly written in coordinate representation as
