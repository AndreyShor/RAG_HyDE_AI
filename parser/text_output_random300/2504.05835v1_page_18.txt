It’s easy to see that the magnetic ﬁeld takes its maximum when ̺T2 ≫M, namely the
eﬀective thermal mass much larger than the normal mass.
The value of m is to be determined by (4.36). We adopt an extreme parameter set
v = Mp, T1 = 10T2 and Hinf = 1012GeV, which surely make an overestimation of B, then
(4.36) tells c3/T2 = 4.5. We get
B(today) < 3.0 × 10−31

which has an upper bound 3.0 × 10−21[G] when we take T2 = Ta, marginally possible for
seed magnetic ﬁelds. We conclude that magnetic ﬁeld generated during the tachyonic phase
is too small to account for observations even after our overestimation.

Magnetic ﬁeld generated after the tachyonic phase
There will be magneto-genesis after the tachyonic phase as well. To estimate the scalar
power spectrum after T = T2, we will simply assume that the transition of χ ﬁeld to the
new vacuum is instantaneous. Therefore, the scalar power spectrum after the transition is
estimated as Pφ(T = T +
2 ) ≃v2. The transfer function becomes
T (T; T2) = φk(T)
φk(T2) =

where T3 is the termination of magneto-genesis and n = 1 for ̺T ≫λM case while n = 3/2
for ̺T ≪λM case. Here we ignore the oscillations and only focus on the decaying part of
transfer function. The time integral becomes
