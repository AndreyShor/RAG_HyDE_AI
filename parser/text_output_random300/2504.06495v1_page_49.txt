Acknowledgments
A key inspiration for this paper was David Spiegelhalter’s recent Nature essay, “Why Prob-
ability Probably Doesn’t Exist (but It Is Useful to Act Like It Does)” — a title we could
have easily borrowed here. I am grateful to my wife, as well as to Oxford University and
Nuﬃeld College, for their support — though all three would likely prefer me to write about
Economics. I am also sincerely grateful to the professors who taught me Physics years ago,
especially Richard Kowarschik and Dietrich Kramer in Jena; Hans Fraas, Thorsten Ohl, and
Reinhold Rueckl in W¨urzburg; and Jan Louis and Henning Samtleben in Hamburg. Finally,
I thank ChatGPT and Claude.ai for helping to improve many formulations in this paper
and for providing invaluable research assistance with regards to proofs of various stochastic
process results in the appendix.

Proofs of Theorems 1, 2, 3
A.1
Useful results from Karlin and Taylor (1981)
For the proof of Theorem 3, we rely on classical results from the theory of one-dimensional
diﬀusion processes with absorbing boundaries, as presented in Karlin and Taylor (1981),
particularly Chapter 15, Section 13, which covers the spectral representation of the transition
density. We summarize the key ingredients relevant to our analysis. We use the notation
f(τ) ∼g(τ) to denote that f(τ)/g(τ) →1 as τ →∞, and f(x) ∝g(x) to denote equality
up to a constant factor independent of x.
Consider a one-dimensional diﬀusion process {X(τ), τ ≥0} evolving on an interval (c, ∞),
with an absorbing boundary at x = c, and governed by the stochastic diﬀerential equation:
dX(τ) = −µ dτ + σ dW(τ),
where µ > 0, σ > 0, and {W(τ)} is a standard Brownian motion. The inﬁnitesimal generator
