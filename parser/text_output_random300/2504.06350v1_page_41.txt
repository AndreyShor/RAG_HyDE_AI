Proof. (details in Refs. [84, 82, 83]). The smooth min-entropy Hϵ
min is related to the sandwiched R´enyi
entropy Hα for some parameter α > 1 used to decompose the entropy of the full sequence into a sum
of conditional entropies for each round: Hα(On
1 |Sn
1 E) ≈Pn
i=1 Hα(Oi|SiE). The Markovinity ensures
that each term Hα(Oi|SiE) depends only on the previous rounds and not the entire sequence. Now,
Hα can be bounded by the von Neumann entropy H(Oi|SiE) using properties of the R´enyi entropy
Hα(Ai|BiR) ≈H(Ai|BiR) −O(α −1). Combining this with the tradeoff function fmin, which lower
bounds H(Oi|SiE), we get: Hα(Ai|BiR) ≥f(p(ω)) −O(α −1). The distribution p(ω) of the classical
outcomes is used to bound the entropy of the sequence. The observed event Ωensures that f(p(ω)) ≥t,
i.e. the entropy rate averaged over all rounds is at least t. The finite-size effects arise because n is finite
and fmin depends on the second order statistical fluctuations ν√n in the observed data. The sandwiched
R´enyi entropy Hα is converted to the smooth min-entropy Hϵ
min. Thus, the total smooth min-entropy
grows approximately linearly with n, up to finite-size corrections.
4.1.1. Finite key analysis with EAT
Thanks to EAT, the key rate r of CHSH protocol versus the QBER Q can be predicted at finite n
(see Fig. 13). For n = 1015, the curve nearly overlaps the asymptotic iid case 3.6, which was shown to
be optimal allowing the protocol to tolerate up to Q = 0.071.
Instead, for non-iid coherent attack analysis, the key rate obtained in [65] remains well below the
lowest curve presented in Fig. 13, even if the number of signals approaches infinity, with a maximum
noise tolerance of only 1.6%. Fig. 13 shows the key rate as a function of the number of rounds n, for
different values of Q. Evidently, the rates achieved are significantly higher than those without EAT, and
are comparable to the key rates of the practical device-dependent QKD with the difference that the device-
independent one requires a larger n. Indeed, the finite-key analysis in Ref. [79] shows that the experiments
[74] and [181] require, respectively, n = 108 and n = 1010 rounds against coherent attacks for r > 0.
This analysis involves noisy preprocessing, random key measurements, and modified CHSH inequalities.
While this is a marked improvement wrt the basic protocol in [57] (Sec. 3.6) (which yields zero asymptotic
key rates for those experiments), the values of n are still impractical. Therefore, two modifications were
applied: (i) a pre-shared key, which results in a net key generation rate approximately double that of
