2M-WS2
Our first system of interest is the 2M phase of WS2.
This van der Waals compound has recently attracted
significant research attention for intrinsically combining
electronic band topology and superconductivity [70]. The
superconducting transition temperature of 2M-WS2 is
reported to be Tc ≈8.8 K at ambient pressure, one
of the highest among transition metal dichalcogenides.
Above Tc, multiple angle-resolved photoemission spec-
troscopy studies have revealed the existence of a Dirac
surface state at the Fermi level [70–73], consistent with
the first-principles band simulations [74–76]. Below Tc,
non-split zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) in the scanning tunnel-
ing spectroscopy (STM) are found to show up around the
Abrikosov vortex cores [19, 20]. While observing ZBPs in
2M-WS2 is consistent with a MZM interpretation, other
non-topological origins of ZBPs cannot be easily ruled
out. This motivates us to clarify this puzzle for 2M-WS2
from an ab initio computational perspective.
As shown in Fig. 6 (a), 2M-WS2 crystallizes under the
space group C2/m (No. 12). Our choice of optimized
lattice constants are a = 12.87˚A, b = 3.22˚A, c = 5.27˚A,
with the axial angles α=γ=90◦, and β=112.9◦, which
agrees well with experimental results [70].
There are
two monoclinic monolayers in one unit cell, which holds
the distorted octahedral building blocks as the monolayer
1T′-WTe2 [77] and 1T′-WSe2 [78]. These two 1T′ mono-
layers stack along the a direction to form a bulk crystal,
thus preserving the inversion symmetry P. This config-
uration is different from the well-known Td phase with
Weyl fermions [79].
Our calculation of the electronic band structure with
FPLO is shown in Fig. 6 (b), where we have included
the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effect.
We have used
Gamma-centered k meshes of 21×21×21 and the conver-
gence criteria for the density and energy are set to 10−6
and 10−8, respectively. Specifically, we find two electron-
like pockets at Γ and L points and one hole pocket around
Y point, where our notation of high symmetry points is
given in Fig. 6 (c). We consider a continuous yet energet-
ically curving band gap between conduction and valence
bands in the BZ and calculate the occupied-band parity
products for all TRIMs. The Z2 topological indices are
found to be (1; 000), consistent with calculations in the
literature [70].
We now construct a set of symmetry-conserving
MLWF from the GGA Bloch wave functions by FPLO.
The projected basis of the MLWF involves 20 d-orbitals
of two W atoms and 24 p-orbitals of four S atoms. There-
fore, the Wannier model h0(k) for 2M-WS2 consists of 44
bands, whose symmetry properties have been compre-
hensively confirmed. With the iterative Green’s function
method [80], the (100) and (001) surface dispersions are
shown in Fig. 6 (d) and (e), respectively. In particular,
the (100) surface shows a single Dirac cone at Γ point
around the Fermi level, which is in excellent agreement
with prior ARPES results [71, 73]. Interestingly, we also
find a second Dirac surface state at Γ, slightly below the
Fermi level, which we attribute to the band inversion at
the Y point between the two topmost valance bands. Due
to the energetic proximity, the two Dirac cones anticross
when dispersing away from Γ. As shown in Fig 6 (e),
the (001) surface also features a gapless surface state, as
expected from the nontrivial Z2 topology of the system.
In experiments, STM studies of vortices were per-
formed on the cleaved (100) surface. Therefore, we need
to study the CdGM physics of a [100]-directional vor-
tex tube, or equivalently a π-junction along either [001]
or [010] direction. We have constructed a BdG model,
dubbed H[001](k∥), which describes a π-junction geom-
etry with Na unit cells along [001].
We find that the
simulation results have converged when the pairing am-
plitude is 30 meV and below. Thus, we use ∆0 = 10 meV
as the default pairing amplitude in all our simulations of
2M-WS2, with which the localization length of the An-
dreev bound states is around 3 nm. As a result, we set
the junction size to be Na = 500, or equivalently 263 nm,
to avoid any finite-size effect.
Upon diagonalizing H[001], we map out µ-dependent
energy gap distributions for 2M-WS2 along N-Γ-N and
Y-Γ-Y, as plotted in Figs. 6 (f) and (g), respectively.
In particular, we are looking for gap-closure points in
the (k, µ)-space that suggest quantum critical points of
JT. For example, there exist two gapless nodes in Fig. 6
