The Σ+ →pµ+µ−decay is a flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) process that
is allowed only at loop level within the Standard Model (SM). The decay rate could
be significantly modified by the presence of new physics (NP) beyond the SM effects.
Short-distance contributions in the SM arise from box, Z- and electromagnetic-penguin
processes, whose combined branching fraction is predicted to be O(10−12) [1]. While this is
significantly smaller than the predicted long-distance contribution, it is worth noting that
NP contributions are expected to manifest at short distance [2–4], potentially modifying
the expected decay rate. The long-distance SM contribution is calculated from weak
nonleptonic decays Σ+ →(Nπ)+ and the subsequent reactions (Nπ)+ →pγ(∗),1 where N
represents either a proton, p, or a neutron, n, and γ∗is a virtual photon. The branching
fraction prediction contains an inherent eight-fold ambiguity due to the presence of four
complex form factors studied in both relativistic and heavy-baryon chiral perturbation
theory (χPT). A unitarity argument determines their imaginary parts [1–3,5–7], while
the real components are predicted from the measured Σ+ →pγ decay rate [8], which is
responsible for a remaining four-fold degeneracy in each χPT approach. The most recent
theoretical predictions for the branching fraction B(Σ+ →pµ+µ−) lie within the range
[1.2, 7.8] × 10−8 [3]. Progress has also been made towards a lattice calculation of this
branching fraction [9,10].
Evidence for this channel was first found by the HyperCP experiment with a measured
branching fraction of B(Σ+ →pµ+µ−) = (8.6 + 6.6
−5.4 ± 5.5) × 10−8 [11], compatible with all
SM predictions. Note that the measurement was based on three observed candidates
with nearly identical dimuon invariant mass, close to the kinematic limit, suggesting
an unexpected hint of structure with mass mX0 = 214.3 ± 0.5 MeV/c2. If confirmed,
this would have pointed towards the decay of an intermediate particle into two muons,
i.e. a Σ+ →pX0(→µ+µ−) decay. This result attracted significant theoretical attention
attempting to explain the origin of this hypothetical state [12–22]. In general, a pseu-
doscalar particle is favoured over a scalar state, with a lifetime in the order of 10−14 s
estimated for the former. Considerable experimental efforts have been made in order to
search for this particle in other experiments and decay modes [23–34]. The first search
using Σ+ →pµ+µ−decays since the HyperCP evidence was performed by LHCb with
Run 1 proton-proton (pp) collision data [35], corresponding to an integrated luminos-
ity of 3 fb−1 collected at a centre-of-mass energy √s = 7 TeV. An excess of 10.2 + 3.9
−3.5
events was observed with a significance of 4.1 standard deviations (σ), corresponding
to a branching fraction of B(Σ+ →pµ+µ−) = (2.2 + 1.8
−1.3) × 10−8, compatible with all
SM predictions. The background-subtracted dimuon invariant-mass distribution was
consistent with that of a phase-space (PHSP) simulation, leading to an upper limit of
B(Σ+ →pX0(→µµ)) < 1.4 × 10−8 at the 90% confidence level for a hypothetical X0
particle, which disfavours the central value determined by the HyperCP collaboration.
This Letter presents the first observation of the Σ+ →pµ+µ−decay. This analysis is
performed with pp collision data recorded by the LHCb experiment in 2016–2018 (Run 2)
at √s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.4 fb−1. A measurement
of the Σ+ →pµ+µ−branching fraction is reported, using the Σ+ →pπ0 decay as
normalisation channel. The dimuon invariant-mass distribution for signal decays is also
presented. This analysis follows a similar strategy to that performed using Run 1 data [35],
with several improvements implemented, namely more efficient particle identification
1The inclusion of charge-conjugated processes is implied throughout.
