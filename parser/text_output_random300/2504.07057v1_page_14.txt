Fig. S4 Low cloud precipitation frequency during daytime (a), nighttime (b), and their relative
difference (c). The precipitation frequency is calculated as the ratio between CloudSat low cloud
precipitation occurrence and the CALIOP low cloud occurrence.
Fig. S5 Temporal changees in responses of precipitation absolute and relative changes of frequency
and intensity. Due to small collocated sample sizes, we divide the data into three bins. Precipitation
is initially strongly suppressed, but those samples that experience more nighttime conditions and
more aged show muted difference.
