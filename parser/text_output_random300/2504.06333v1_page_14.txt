In summary, a quasi-Hopf algebra H with a coassociator Φ describes a fu-
sion category Rep(H) whose ’t Hooft anomaly is classiﬁed by [Φ]gauge the gauge
equivalence class of Φ.

Exact sequences and anomaly resolutions
Now, recall that one way to obtain exact sequences of non-anomalous fusion cat-
egories is by working with exact sequences of Hopf algebras
A Ð→˜H Ð→H
(4.3)
and applying the representation functor Rep(−) to get an exact sequence of fusion
categories
Rep(H) Ð→Rep( ˜H) Ð→Rep(A).
(4.4)
In light of the intuition of quasi-Hopf algebras and the gauge equivalence relation
on coassociators, whose deﬁnitions we recall below, we can extend this method
to obtain anomaly resolutions. Namely, given an exact sequence of quasi-Hopf
algebras
D ↪C Ð→K
(4.5)
where D is not gauge equivalent to a Hopf algebra but C and K are, one applies
the representation functor to get
Rep(K) Ð→Rep(C) Ð→Rep(D),
(4.6)
so that Rep(C) admits a ﬁber functor, but not Rep(K). This resolves the anoma-
lous Rep(K) by the non-anomalous Rep(C).
In particular, this picture subsumes the anomaly resolution of group-like sym-
metries. This is because given a ﬁnite group G and an anomaly 3-cocycle α, one
can construct a quasi-Hopf algebra CG
α which is gauge equivalent to CG iﬀα has
a trivial cohomology class. Then, a group anomaly resolution
K Ð→˜G
π
Ð→G
(4.7)
where the 3-cocycle α ∈Z3(G,U(1)) with nontrivial cohomology class pulls back
to a 3-coboundary π∗α ∈Z3( ˜G,U(1)) is equivalently described by a sequence of
quasi Hopf algebras
CG
α Ð→(C
˜G)gauge Ð→(CK)gauge,
(4.8)
where (C ˜G)gauge,(CK)gauge are quasi-Hopf algebras gauge equivalent to the dual
group algebras C ˜G,CK. At the level of representation categories, this is simply
Vec(K) Ð→Vec( ˜G) Ð→Vec(G,α).
