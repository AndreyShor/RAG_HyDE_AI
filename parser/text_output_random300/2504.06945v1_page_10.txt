We first observe that, since there is no correction in δRe[ΣR] when one include the boson dynamics, the left-hand side
Eq. (40) remains unchanged.
On the other hand, the correction to the collision integral due to the bosonic density
fluctuations is captured by
δIfb = f0(ωp) δΣ>
fb(ωp, θpq; Ω, q) −[ f0(ωp) −1 ] δΣ<

Even though δIfb is finite, and it couples δf and δn self-consistently, we find that the Fermi surface displacement [viz.
u(θp; Ω, q)], as arises in Eq. (20), does not depend on δn. This can be seen by integrating δIfb over the fermionic frequency,
ωp. Because the integrand is an odd function of ωp, we have

Hence, we conclude that we end up with the same collective mode equation [viz. Eq. (20)], without any correction coming
from the fluctuating bosonic density.

DISCUSSIONS, SUMMARY, AND FUTURE OUTLOOK
In this paper, we have analyzed the nature of generic displacements of the critical Fermi surface for the NFL system aris-
ing at the Ising-nematic QCP, by using the quantum-Boltzmann-equation formalism applicable for our NFL scenario. By
incorporating a generalized fermionic distribution function, we have derived the self-consistent equations, whose solutions
give us the functional forms of the Fermi-surface displacements as well as their dispersions. In particular, we have been
focussed on determining the dispersion and stability of the low-energy and low-momentum excitations/collective modes,
arising from these displacements. Compared with our earlier work [36], we have included here the effects of damping,
originating from the collision integral for the fermionic QBE. For the s-wave channel of the deformations, we summarize
our findings in the following:
1. The collective mode’s dispersion exhibits a Ωr ∼|q|6/5 dispersion at the lowest energy scales, unlike the ∼|q| depen-
dence of the zero-sound collective mode of a Fermi liquid. This fractional-power-law dependence is seen to morph into
an Ωr ∼|q|-behaviour, when the energy is cranked up above a crossover scale, Ω0.
2. As a consequence of accounting for the collision terms, the dispersion acquires a nonzero imaginary part, Ωi, which
corresponds to damping. However, |Ωi| is parametrically much smaller than Ωr, making the ℓ= 0 mode a long-lived
excitation. Ωi is also seen to crossover to distinct power-law characteristics with respect to Ω0. As a function of the
mode’s momentum, the ratio of |Ωi/Ωr| decays rapidly in a monotonic way (in all the applicable energy ranges), and
becomes more and more negligible.
We have extended our calculations to include the effects of the bosonic density fluctuations as well. Interestingly, the
T = 0 results for the Fermi-surface displacements remain unchanged under this generalization.
In the future, it will be worthwhile to extend our calculations to the finite-temperature regimes, which is a challenging
task, given that we have to employ the framework of thermal quantum field theory. Other directions include recomputing
everything for the case of a charged NFL, when Coulomb interactions will contribute (see, for example, Ref. [35]).
Appendix A: Assorted Green’s functions in the Keldysh formalism
We study the collective modes of a critical Fermi surface at a quantum critical point using the Quantum Boltzmann
equation (QBE). We use the standard definitions following Refs. [43–46] for defining the nonequilibrium matrix Green’s
functions. Denoting them as ˜G and ˜D for the fermions and the critical bosons, respectively, we have
