Qt
FIG. 1. Schematic illustration of the step initial condition for
ρa = 1 and ρb = 0. Starting from the step initial condition,
we evolve the system according to Eq. (1) and investigate
the fluctuations of an integrated current Qt across the bond
between site 0 and site 1.
In this state, each site to the left of the origin (x ≤0) is
independently occupied with the probability ρa, and each
site to the right of the origin is independently occupied
with the probability ρb (see Fig. 1). Note that the state
corresponds to a steady state when ρa = ρb and a domain
wall state when (ρa,ρb) = (1,0) or (0,1).
We will study the fluctuation of an integrated current
Qt, defined as total currents has flowed from time 0 to
t across the bond between site 0 and site 1.
Due to
particle number conservation, Qt can be measured via
a two-time measurement of the particle number in the
right half of the system, NR ∶= ∑x≥1 nx; specifically Qt
is obtained by the difference between the measurement
outcomes of NR at time t and time 0 [74, 75]. The fluctu-
ation of Qt can be characterized by the moment generat-
ing function ⟨eλQt⟩or the cumulant generating function
χ(λ,t) ∶= log⟨eλQt⟩. Here, we define the average of a func-
tion f(Qt) as ⟨f(Qt)⟩∶= ∑n∈Z f(n)Pr[Qt = n], denoting
a probability that Qt takes the value n as Pr[Qt = n].
This probability can be expressed in terms of Born prob-
abilities, which yield the compact analytical expression
of ⟨eλQt⟩[74, 75],
⟨eλQt⟩= Tr[eλNReLt[e−λNRρini]].
(3)
See Sec. I of the Supplemental Material (SM) [76] for the
derivation. From ⟨eλQt⟩, the variance of the integrated
current σ2
Qt ∶= ⟨Qt⟩2 −⟨Qt⟩2, the quantity of our prime
interest, can be expressed as σ2
Qt = ∂2
λ χ(λ,t)∣λ=0.
ω-dependence.— We show that ⟨eλQt⟩depends on ρa,
ρb, and λ only through a single reduced parameter
ω ∶= ρa(eλ −1) + ρb(e−λ −1) + ρaρb(eλ −1)(e−λ −1).
Specifically, ⟨eλQt⟩can be expanded in terms of ω as
⟨eλQt⟩= ∑n≥0 qn(t)ωn. Here qn(t) is given by the sum of
the n-particle density matrices,
qn(t) ∶=
∑
y1<⋯<yn≤0<x1<⋯<xn
⟨x∣eLt[∣y⟩⟨y∣]∣x⟩,
(4)
where we define x ∶= (x1,⋯,xn) and ∣x⟩∶= a†
x1⋯a†
xn∣0⟩
with the vacuum state ∣0⟩. We shall refer this dependence
to as the ω-dependence because a similar dependence has
been observed in stochastic interacting systems and it is
called the ω-dependence [65, 66].
Thanks to the ω-dependence, σ2
Qt can be expressed as
σ2
Qt = (ρa −ρb)2[2q2 −q2
1] + (ρa + ρb −2ρaρb)q1.
(5)
In this expression, the variance is determined solely by
q1(t) and q2(t) which are the sum of the single and two-
particle density matrices, and no longer depend on ρa
or ρb. This implies that the problem of calculating σ2
Qt,
which originally involves the infinitely many particles and
depends on ρa and ρb, is reduced to the single- and two-
particle problems, both independent of these parameters.
Note that this reduction holds for general n-th moments.
That is, each ⟨Qn
t ⟩is determined by qj(t), (j = 1,⋯,n).
The derivation of the ω-dependence relies on particle-
hole symmetry and a duality relation between the n-
particle density matrix and a 2n-point correlation func-
tion [77, 78], namely the time evolution of the 2n-point
correlation function is equivalent to that of the n-particle
density matrix. The detailed derivation is given in Sec.
II of SM [76]. We remark that several models have the
particle-hole symmetry and the duality relation, for ex-
ample the tight-binding chain with incoherent symmetric
hopping [77], and therefore the ω-dependence could be
extended to such models as well.

In

the

function
is
defined
as
G(n)
t
(x(1);x(2)∣y(1);y(2)) ∶= ⟨x(1)∣eLt[∣y(1)⟩⟨y(2)∣]∣x(2)⟩
with x(j) ∶= (x(j)
1 ,⋯,x(j)
n ), y(j) ∶= (y(j)
1 ,⋯,y(j)
n ). If one
obtains an analytical expression for the Green’s func-
tion, one has the full time dependence for any n-particle
density matrix by appropriately summing over y(1) and
y(2). In what follows, we focus on G(n)
t
(x(1);x(2)∣y;y),
since it suffices to derive the analytical expression for
σ2
Qt (see Eq. (4) and Eq. (5)). For simplicity, we denote
it by G(n)
t
(x(1);x(2)∣y), and assume that y1 < ⋯< yn
without loss of generality.
As shown in Ref. [78], our model can be mapped to the
one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with imaginary
interaction, which is exactly solvable via the Bethe ansatz
[79, 80]. Indeed, by defining ψ(2n)

(x;a∣y) as

(x;a∣y) ∶=

motion for G(2n)
