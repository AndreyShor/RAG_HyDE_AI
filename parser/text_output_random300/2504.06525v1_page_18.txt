MOBO exploration projected from 3D parameter space to the setpoint vs. drive amplitude 2D 
space with the I gain set to be its optimal value. b, hypervolume gain curve at different iteration 
steps for the MOBO training workflow. The dashed gay lines separate the initial seeding steps 
from the active learning steps. c-f, the predicted distribution of c height difference, d tip-sample 
distance, e phase, and f similarity rewards in the setpoint â€“ drive amplitude space at 50th in the 
MOBO.
