interactions in PDG, it has the opposite effect for them in C-D interactions within SDG.
To further characterize the influence of µ and σ on cooperation levels, in Fig. 5, we
perform an exhaustive exploration in (σ, µ) control parameter space for selected values of
b: (a) b = 1.05, (b) b = 1.10, and (c) b = 1.15, respectively.
As expected, only as b
increases and for low σ and µ, cooperation levels vanishes.
Conversely, the majority of
(σ, µ) promotes high levels of cooperation. Cooperation is totally adopted for high µ, across
any value of σ. Compared to previous research [49], our multi-game framework can sustain
higher cooperation at higher b values.
Now, in Fig. 6, we delve into how cooperation levels are shared within the sets of players
playing respectively PDG and SDG. For reference, we also represent the cooperation fraction
