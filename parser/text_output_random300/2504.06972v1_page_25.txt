Extended Data Fig. 4 | Perpendicular magnetic field dependence of ρxx-νh-D and ρxy-νh-D 
maps at base temperature. Symmetrized ρxx and anti-symmetrized ρxy as a function of νh and 
D, measured at varying B (0.3 T, 0.5 T, 1 T, 2 T, 3 T, 6 T) and TMC = 15 mK. As the magnetic 
field increases, the superconducting state is gradually suppressed. In contrast, the νh > 2/3 
RIQAH state extends over a broader D-field range with increasing B, eventually taking over 
the superconducting region at sufficiently high B-field. The existence of VHS is evident from 
the sign change in ρxy at νh around 0.75 at D = 0, which shifts towards higher values of νh as D 
increases, in good agreement with the calculation results (Extended Data Fig. 10). Note that the 
ρxy sign change can only be observed at B ≥ 2 T, presumably due to the normal Hall signals 
dominant over the anomalous Hall signals around VHS under such B-fields.
