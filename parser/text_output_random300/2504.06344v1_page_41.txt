Moduli dependence of the SU(3) Wilson lines for the constant-F solu-
tions with r = k on the tuned-T4
For completeness, here we give the Wilson lines for SU(3) in the form (ℜWµ, ℑWµ)(x = 0, zµ)
in the case N = 3 and k = r = 1, plotted on Figure 2:
(ℜW1, ℑW1) = (cos(4πz1) + 2 cos(2πz1), −sin(4πz1) + 2 sin(2πz1)) ,
(ℜW2, ℑW2) = (cos(4πz2) + 2 cos(2πz2), −sin(4πz2) + 2 sin(2πz2)) ,
(ℜW3, ℑW3) = (cos(4πz3), −sin(4πz3)) ,
(ℜW4, ℑW4) = (cos(4πz4), −sin(4πz4)) .
(B.1)
Here, we have relabeled the four moduli of eqn. (2.10) as ϕC′=1
µ
= 4πzµ where the range of
zµ is z1,2 ∈[0, 1] and z3,4 ∈[0, 1
2], as per [27]. The curves in the four (ℜWµ, ℑWµ)(x = 0, zµ)
planes, traced as zµ is varied are shown by the continuous lines on Figure 2.
For the case of N = 3 and r = k = 2, the Wilson lines, also given in the form
(ℜWµ, ℑWµ)(x = 0, ϕC′
µ ), have a more complicated expression [27]. This is because there
are now 8 moduli ϕC′=1
µ
and ϕC′=2
µ
, as per (2.10). However, their ranges and meaning32 are
more transparent upon changing variables as ϕ1
µ = 2π(zµ −aµ), ϕ2
µ = 2π(zµ + aµ), where the
ranges of zµ and aµ are zµ ∈[0, 1] and aµ ∈[0, 1
2]. Now, we find, from Appendix D of [27]:
(ℜW1, ℑW1) = (−cos (2π(−z1 + a1)) −cos (2π(z1 + a1)) + cos(4πz1),
−sin (2π(−z1 + a1)) + sin (2π(z1 + a1)) + sin(4πz1)) ,

sin (2π(−z3 + a3)) −sin (2π(z3 + a3)) + sin(4πz3)) ,
(ℜW4, ℑW4) = (cos (2π(−z4 + a4)) + cos (2π(z4 + a4)) + cos(4πz4),
sin (2π(−z4 + a4)) −sin (2π(z4 + a4)) + sin(4πz4)) .
(B.2)
When aµ = 0, as a function of zµ, the above equations trace the solid curves shown on each
(ℜWµ, ℑWµ)(x = 0, zµ, 0) plane on Figure 4. As aµ is varied away from 0, they fill the inside
of the envelope of the solid curves on the figure.

Numerical studies on the lattice
To study fractional instantons numerically, e.g. as in [64], we consider a lattice of size
(L1, L2, L3, L4).
Link variables are related to gauge fields in the usual way via ˜Uµ(n) =
32As explained in [27], when the r = k = 2 solution is considered on the ∆̸= 0 deformed-T4, zµ becomes
the center of mass coordinate of the two-lump instanton and aµ is the relative separation coordinate.
