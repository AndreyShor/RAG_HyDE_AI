Figure 1: Cardiovascular model schematic of the Eye2Heart closed loop circuit.
Cardiovascular System
The cardiovascular system in this model builds upon the mathematical framework proposed by Avanzolini et al [2],
modified to account for its coupling with the upper circulation that supplies blood specifically to one eye. The aortic
pressure (Paorta) and the right venous-atrial pressure (Pvc) are now interfaced with an ad hoc upper circulation module,
designed to model blood flow to the ocular compartment and specifically to the retinal circulation.
To incorporate these dynamics, the original equations have been reformulated, ensuring seamless integration of
the new blood circulation pathway into the system. A key parameter, Rbody, which represents the equivalent peripheral
resistance of the body, has been updated to reflect the redistribution of blood volume toward the eye. In the original
model, Rbody was assigned a value of 6.75 · 10−2 [mmHg · s · ml−1]. In the revised eye-heart model, this parameter has
