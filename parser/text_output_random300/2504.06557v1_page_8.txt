In a simple random graph model, two nodes are randomly selected from a list 
of ùëõ nodes at each calculation step, and an edge is generated between them [27]. For 
example, Fig 1 shows the calculation results for the Kauffman button and thread model. 
The results are for ùëõ= 100 and three calculations were performed. When the ratio of 
the number of threads to the number of buttons exceeds 0.5 on the horizontal axis, the 
largest cluster size (number of nodes) suddenly increases on the vertical axis.

In the four economic modes, the settings for the node list and edge direction 
were changed based on a simple random graph model. Table 1 shows the four economic 
modes proposed by Polanyi, Karatani, Graeber, and Deguchi and the model settings 
corresponding to each economic mode. The following order has been rearranged from 
(i) gift economy, (ii) power economy, (iii) market economy, and (iv) concession 
economy in the Introduction: (a) market economy, (b) power economy, (c) gift
