underwent 150 GA generations. This experiment aimed to identify
whether specific strategies or strategy combinations yield superior
fitness outcomes. We used diverse hyperparameter values to mini-
mize biases in parameter settings. Table 1 summarizes the results
of 300 trials under different conditions.
Table 1: Results from 300 trials with different parameter
settings chosen by Optuna. The highest mean and 75th per-
centile appear in the swap, addition combination, while swap,
addition, deletion yields the highest median and 25th per-
centile.

Individual Strategies. Fig. 11 shows that including a mutation
strategy typically boosts performance relative to not using it, except
for change, which lowers overall fitness. Swap increases variability
the most, while change reduces it—at the cost of lower mean fitness.
Both deletion and addition have minimal influence on standard
deviation.
Combined Strategies. Fig. 10 highlights several promising com-
binations, especially swap, addition, swap, addition, deletion, and

swap, deletion. Notably, these do not include change, reinforcing
that change generally underperforms. The strong impact of swap is
intuitive, because swapping operations can introduce significant
restructuring. The use of addition or deletion helps maintain or
adjust circuit complexity.
Summary. Swap, deletion emerges as a particularly robust strat-
egy, consistently achieving near-top results and reducing circuit
depth over time. Addition can be useful but constantly increases
depth, making swap, deletion an efficient choice for retaining strong
performance while limiting circuit growth.

Impact of Mutation Rate, Population, and
Adaptive Mutation
We also investigated how hyperparameters—mutation rate, popula-
tion size, and adaptive mutation—affect mutation strategy perfor-
mance.
Mutation Rate. Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 show that, within the tested
ranges, further adjusting mutation rates after narrowing their bounds
had little effect on final fitness. This indicates prior tuning already
identified rates near local optima.
