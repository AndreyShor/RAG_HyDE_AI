ABSTRACT
Accurately predicting fluid dynamics and evolution has been a long-standing chal-
lenge in physical sciences. Conventional deep learning methods often rely on the
nonlinear modeling capabilities of neural networks to establish mappings between
past and future states, overlooking the fluid dynamics, or only modeling the ve-
locity field, neglecting the coupling of multiple physical quantities. In this paper,
we propose a new physics-informed learning approach that incorporates coupled
physical quantities into the prediction process to assist with forecasting. Central
to our method lies in the discretization of physical equations, which are directly
integrated into the model architecture and loss function. This integration enables
the model to provide robust, long-term future predictions. By incorporating phys-
ical equations, our model demonstrates temporal extrapolation and spatial gener-
alization capabilities. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in spatiotemporal prediction across both numerical
simulations and real-world extreme-precipitation nowcasting benchmarks.

INSTRUCTION
The prediction and analysis of fluid dynamics play a crucial role across many fields of science. Fluid
phenomena span a wide range of scales, from macroscopic atmospheric circulation to microscopic
intracellular transport, underscoring the complexity and significance of fluid motion. However, noisy
data, experimental limitations, and the inaccessibility of physical quantities present substantial chal-
lenges in learning the underlying dynamical systems and accurately predicting future fluid evolution.
These challenges primarily arise for two reasons. First, latent physical quantities are inherently
difficult to obtain. For example, the advection and diffusion of substances within fluid flows are
governed by the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, which couple multiple variables—such as velocity,
pressure, and concentration—into a complex, interdependent system. Capturing real-time data, like
velocity and pressure, without interference is highly challenging. Successful approaches usually rely
on supervised learning for these quantities, but such data is not easy to obtain in practical scenarios.
While the HFM (Raissi et al., 2020) has made notable progress by inferring latent physical quantities
from PDEs and observed concentration data, it still falls short of predicting future fluid evolution.
Second, the complexity of the NS equations presents a substantial obstacle. These nonlinear equa-
tions couple multiple physical quantities, making the direct prediction of future fluid behavior nearly
impossible. A promising approach is the use of neural operators, which predict future physical fields
based on past observations without explicitly solving the NS equations (Li et al., 2020; Tran et al.,
2023; Wang et al., 2024). These models leverage the powerful nonlinear approximation capabilities
of neural networks to map past fluid states to future. However, the absence of physical constraints
often limits their interpretability and generalization ability. Another approach involves approximat-
ing and simplifying the NS equations through methods like kernel methods or other theorems and
applying neural networks to estimate the fluid velocity field. By combining the estimated velocity
field with simplified equations, these methods attempt to predict future fluid behavior (Deng et al.,
2023; Xing et al., 2024). However, these methods lack intuitive clarity, and focusing solely on the
velocity field overlooks the complex multivariable coupling intrinsic to the NS equations.
