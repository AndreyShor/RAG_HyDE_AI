We are now ready to state our up-to-constants estimates on the four-arm events for simple
CLE (Section 1.1), which, as we just explained, rely on a key separation lemma (Section 1.2). As a
consequence, we then derive up-to-constants estimates on the four-arm events for SLE (Section 1.3).
1.1
Four-arm events for simple CLE
For κ ∈(8/3, 4], let Γ+ (resp. Γ) be a CLEκ in the upper half-plane H (resp. the unit disk D).
Let us first define the following general four-arm events, which correspond to the existence of four
curves crossing a given annulus in the CLEκ.
• (Arms by one loop) Let E+
1 (ε, r) (resp. E1(ε, r)) be the event that there is a loop γ in Γ+
(resp. Γ) which makes 4 crossings in the annulus Aε,r := Br \ Bε, in other words γ ∩Aε,r
contains at least 4 curves, which each have one endpoint on ∂Br and one endpoint on ∂Bε.
• (Arms by two loops) Let E+
2 (ε, r) (resp. E2(ε, r)) be the event that there are at least two loops
γ1 and γ2 in Γ+ (resp. Γ) such that each of them intersects both ∂Bε and ∂Br.
We define the boundary four-arm event by A+
4 (ε, r) := E+
1 (ε, r) ∪E+
2 (ε, r), and the interior four-
arm event by A4(ε, r) := E1(ε, r) ∪E2(ε, r).
See Figure 1.1 for an illustration of the possible
configurations for the interior four-arm event.
Our first main result consists in the following up-to-constants estimates for four-arm events in
CLEκ.
Theorem 1.1. For κ ∈(8/3, 4] and r ∈(0, 1), we have the following estimates, as ε →0,
P(E+
1 (ε, r)) ≍P(E+
2 (ε, r)) ≍P(A+
4 (ε, r)) ≍εξ+
4 (κ),
(1.3)
P(E1(ε, r)) ≍P(E2(ε, r)) ≍P(A4(ε, r)) ≍εξ4(κ),
(1.4)
where ξ+
4 (κ) = 2(12 −κ)/κ and ξ4(κ) = (12 −κ)(κ + 4)/(8κ).
Let us comment briefly on the strategy of the proof of Theorem 1.1. First, we make use of a
Markovian exploration of the CLE, in the style of [36]. We illustrate such explorations in our warm-
up Section 3, where we derive up-to-constants estimates in the simpler situation of two-arm events
in CLE. Secondly, the above-mentioned estimates on four-arm probabilities for 2-SLE systems
established by Zhan in [45, 46] (see Theorems 2.4 and 2.5 below) play a central role. Finally, in our
setting of CLE, we rely crucially on a separation lemma, which we discuss in the next subsection.

to the event E1(ε, r). The right figure belongs to the event E2(ε, r).
