is polynomial with respect to the field strength tensor, and include an auxiliary scalar field
which satisfies a constraint and can be chosen to lie in a fixed gauge. Thus, a SSB is being
induced and the original symmetry is being reduced to the Lorentz one. The resulting action,
although gauge invariant, is not a total divergence, contrary to (38), and despite the fact that
it includes the G-B topological term, the rest of its terms can provide the usual equations of
motion of EG in AdS space. In this way, we manage to describe the four-dimensional EG as
a gauge theory.
Concerning general covariance, it is recovered by the relation between gauge transfor-
mations and diffeomorphisms. Following the same procedure and calculations as in the 3-d
case, one ends up with the four-dimensional versions of (22) and (23). Therefore, taking into
account the torsionless condition and the equation of motion of vanishing curvature, general
covariance is ensured.

Four-dimensional Conformal gravity
The gauge-theoretic procedure has also been applied in the case of the conformal group,
SO(2, 4) [47, 65–71]. In the early constructions of the conformal group action, the authors
imposed constraints to obtain WG. In the current work, as in our previous work [48], we
instead use the SSB mechanism. This can be done either by introducing two scalars in the
vector representation of SO(6) ∼SO(2, 4) or by a scalar in the 2nd rank antisymmetric rep,
15. In both cases, one can obtain either the SO(1, 3) gauge group or the WG.
The gauge group, SO(2, 4) contains fifteen generators: six Lorentz transformations, Mab,
four translations, Pa , four special conformal transformations (conformal boosts), Ka and
the dilatation (scale transformation), D. These generators satisfy the following commutation
relations which determine the SO(2, 4) algebra,
[Mab, Mcd] = ηbcMad + ηadMbc −ηacMbd −ηbdMac,
[Mab, Pc] = ηbcPa −ηacPb,
[Mab, Kc] = ηbcKa −ηacKb,
[Pa, D] = Pa,
[Ka, D] = −Ka,
[Ka, Pb] = −2(ηabD + Mab),
(48)
where ηab is the mostly positive four-dimensional Minkowski metric. The gauge connection,
Aµ, as an element of the SO(2, 4) algebra, can be expanded in terms of the generators as
Aµ = eµ
aPa + 1
2ωµ
abMab + bµD + fµ
aKa,
(49)
where, for each generator a gauge field has been introduced. The gauge fields related to
the translations are identified as the vierbein, while those of the Lorentz transformations are
identified as the spin connection. The gauge connection, Aµ , obeys the following infinitesimal
transformation rule,
δAµ = Dµϵ = ∂µϵ + [Aµ, ϵ],
