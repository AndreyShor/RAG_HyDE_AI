ALP Yield in E137
For electron beam-dump experiments like E137 or NA64 run in visible mode, the general
formula for the expected number of ALPs that can be detected by the experiment is given
by the expression [70]

with the number of electrons on target (EOT) Ne, the unit length of the radiation target X,
the molar mass of the target atom Mtarget, and the Avogadro constant Navo. Furthermore,
Lsh denotes the length of the beam dump, while Ldec is the length of the decay volume,
i.e.
the distance from the end of the beam dump to the detector.
A summary of the
experimental parameters of E137 and NA64 is given in appendix A.3.
The variable x = Ea/E defines the ratio of the energy transferred from an electron
(or muon for muon beam dumps) of energy E to an ALP with energy Ea.
The lower
integration bound for x can be determined from the requirement that the ALP energy
must be greater than the energy threshold of the detector Ecut, as well as the ALP rest
mass. Assuming the ALP and electron/muon initial and final states are collinear [71], the
upper bound can be approximated by requiring energy conservation in the case that the
outgoing electron/muon is at rest, with the entire energy (excluding the lepton’s rest mass)
being transferred to the ALP. This means the bounds for x are
xmin = max(ma , Ecut)

In this work, we only consider ALPs with mass below 1 GeV, i.e. below the energy threshold,
such that xmin = Ecut/E.
The upper integration boundary for the electron energy is given by the incident beam
energy Emax = E0. The energy of the electrons decreases after impacting the beam dump
due to shower creation and scattering processes [72]. This is not the case for muon beams
(see section 3.4 below). The lower energy bound is given for the electron energy Emin at
which the bounds xmin,max are equal. This integration range for the energy E is, therefore,
in the interval between
Emin = Ecut + mℓ,
Emax = E0 .
(3.3)
The function Ie(E0, E, t) denotes the energy distribution function for electrons with an
energy E at a depth t inside the beam dump.
The maximum depth for t is given by
T = ρLtar/X, where ρ is the density of the target and Ltar is the thickness of the target.
In this work, we consider the primary shower of electrons I(1)
e , as well as the secondary
shower of electrons and positrons I(2)
e,p, which are created through pair production from
photons in the shower [72]. We use the expressions for I(1,2)
e
derived in ref. [72]. However,
we do not use the simplified expressions, which assume that E0 −E ≪E0, but instead use
