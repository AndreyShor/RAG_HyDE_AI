Electric field- induced thiol-ene crosslinked gelation 
In a typical experiment, 210 mg of ZnO was dispersed in 1.5 mL DMF by ultrasound for 20 
seconds and allowed to rest for 30 mins. Two thiol-ene monomers, 1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-
2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione (2 mmol, 499 mg, 0.574 mL) and 2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)diethanethiol (3 
mmol, 546 mg, 0.489 mL) and Et4NBF4 (0.15 mmol, 32.5 mg) were added to the reaction mixture 
in a polypropylene vial.  Finally, the plastic vial was directly attached to the power sources (AC 
or DC power supply) with two wired Pt electrodes. A function generator was used to match the 
efficacy as AC power supply, where the voltage amplitude was configured at the same level (4 
Vrms) to allow efficiency comparisons.  
 
Electric field- induced thiol-acylate linear polymerization 
Electric field-induced acrylate-based polymerization was tested with a similar protocol as E-thiol-
ene chemistry. Briefly, 200 mg of ZnO were dispersed in 1 mL DMF by ultrasound for 20 seconds 
and allowed to rest for 30 mins. Then Et4NBF4 (0.23 mmol, 65mg), EDT (0.61 mmol, 112 mg, 
0.100 mL), and methyl methacrylate (MMA, 1mL) were dissolved in the ZnO dispersion 
consecutively. 2 mL of this mixture was transferred into a plastic vial equipped with two Pt 
electrode outside. Eventually, the sample was connected to an AC power supply (50 Vrms, 500Hz) 
for 48 h.   
 
Electric field- induced disulfide polymerization 
E-field controlled disulfide polymerization was tested with a modified protocol described in a 
literature.31 Briefly, 200 mg of ZnO were dispersed in 3 mL DMF first through ultrasonication. 
Then Et4NBF4 (0.3 mmol, 65 mg), 5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl) pentanamide (1 mmol, 205 mg), and EDT 
(12 µmol, 2.24 mg, 0.002 mL) were dissolved in the ZnO dispersion consecutively. In the end, the 
mixture was transferred into a plastic vial equipped with two Pt electrode and connected with an 
AC power supply (8 Vrms, 500Hz) for 3 h. 
 
Effect of ZnO concentration on thiol-ene crosslinked gelation 
In a typical experiment, various concentrations of ZnO (1.50, 3.75, 5.63, 7.50 and 11.25 wt.%) 
was dispersed in 1.5 mL DMF by ultrasound for 20 seconds and allowed to rest for 30 mins. Two 
thiol-ene crosslinking monomers, TTT (2 mmol, 499 mg, 0.574 mL) and EDT (3 mmol, 546 mg, 
0.489 mL) and Et4NBF4 (0.15 mmol, 32.5 mg) were added to the reaction mixture in a 
polypropylene vial. Then, the reaction mixture was divided into two batches: one batch was 
connected to an AC power source with two Pt electrodes and subjected to 500 Hz, 16 Vrms for 3 
hours, while the other batch was transferred to an oven and cured at 100 ℃ for 24 hours until fully 
crosslinked. 
 
Evaluation of EDT adsorption on nanoparticle surface 
In a typical experiment, ZnO (210 mg, 2.58 mmol) or BaTiO3 (210 mg, 2.58 mmol) was dispersed 
in 1.5 mL DMF by ultrasound for 20 seconds and allowed to rest for 30 mins. 3 mmol EDT (546 
mg, 0.489 mL) was then added into to the suspension in a 50 ml centrifuge tube, and the mixture 
was vortexed for 3 h under 500 rpm. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 15 
min to drive the nanoparticles to sediment. The supernatant solution was withdrawn using a 
transfer pipette, enough ethanol was added to bring the total volume of the suspension back to 50 
ml, and the mixture was vigorously shaken and centrifuged again. This process was repeated so
