Figure 3. XPS narrow-scans of all emission peaks, except for Sn 4s, Te 4s, C 1s, Auger peaks, and valence band (Sn 4p is 
unresolvable). These peak regions as well as the intermediate emission angles 𝜃= 75°, 45°, 15° have been omitted in this 
figure for better readability. The depth distribution function for each emission peak is illustrated schematically in the insets 
(red bars). For better visibility, the peaks have been magnified by a factor indicated in brackets in the top left-hand corner 
of each peak region. The fit residuals are shown in pale grey below the spectra.  
These intensity ratios are then weighted by atomic number densities (𝐼𝑆𝑛2+ ∙𝑁𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒)/(𝐼𝑆𝑛0 ∙𝑁𝑆𝑛𝑂). Each peak occurs 
at a specific value of 𝐸𝑘 corresponding to 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒 and 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑂 (for spin orbit doublets the weighted average of the peak 
position was used as 𝐸𝑘). The weighted intensity ratios have then been fitted by eq. 3 to determine the parameters 𝑑 
and 𝑘, which is shown as a set of colored surface plots in Figure 4a. However, not all peak fittings are equally reliable. 
The peaks with the highest intensity and clearest chemical shift between Sn2+and Sn0 are 3d and 4d. The s- and p-
orbitals show no significant chemical shift (in contrast to other elements such as Ti, for example, for which even the s-
orbitals show a significant chemical shift[20]). The fitting of eq. 3 is thus only based on 3d and 4d. The intensity ratios 
of the other emission peaks have then been taken from the parameterized fit function and applied as constraints in 
the XPS peak fitting (after unweighting 𝑁𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒/𝑁𝑆𝑛𝑂). In this way, these peaks do not contribute any significant 
information to the depth profiling, but conversely, their fitting is more stringently constrained by the expected 
intensity ratios. Thus, reliable and self-consistent peak fitting models can be derived from the depth profiling. The
