the distance at which nonlocal correlations can be observed for both regular and routed Bell experiments.
Since the right-hand side of (96) is always greater than 1/mA1, the detection efficiency of the remote
device A1 cannot be lower than 1/mA1, even if the other detectors are perfect.
Although the bound in (96) applies to both standard and routed Bell experiments, this does not mean
that the Routed Bell experiment cannot be more robust to photon losses than the regular ones. To see
this, consider a protocol that the nearby detectors have the same efficiency ηA0 = ηB = ηS and the remote
detector a lower one ηA1 ≤ηS. Assuming the case that produces maximal CHSH violation (S0 = 2
√
2
for ηS = 1), and following anticommuting measurement settings for A1
A01 = sθσx + cθσz,
A11 = cθσx −sθσz.
(97)
Considering the standard Bell experiment between (A1, B) by ignoring the relay R in fig. 9. The violation
of CHSH inequality is then implied
S1 = 2ηB(cθ + sθ) > 2 −→ηB >
1
cθ + sθ
,
(98)
for the routed Bell inequality using equation (92), one can get the following bound for all values of θ
ηB ≥
1

(99)
Considering that
1
cθ+sθ ≥0.71 (the equality holds for θ =
π
4 ), for values θ ∈(0, π
4 ] the routed Bell
experiment can tolerate higher losses compared to standard Bell inequality. The critical efficiency can be
further reduced by the following LP inequality
Jθ+,θ−
1
= (cθ+ + sθ−sθ+)⟨A01B1⟩+ (cθ+ −sθ−sθ+)⟨A11B1⟩
+ (sθ+ −sθ−cθ+)⟨A01B0⟩+ (sθ+ + sθ−cθ+)⟨A11B0⟩
+ cθ−(⟨A0L⟩+ ⟨A1L⟩) ≤2
(100)
where the SRQ bound Jθ+,θ−
1
≤2 is obtained assuming S0 = 2
√
2 [248]. By considering the general
projective measurements for A1 of the form A01 = sθ0σx + cθ0σz and A11 = sθ1σx + cθ1σz the following
lower bounds can be obtained for standard and routed Bell strategies
ηA1 >



1
cθ+(cθ−+sθ−)
Standard Bell test,
1
1+cθ−
Routed Bell test .
(101)
As θ →0, the critical efficiency in routed Bell scenario approaches
1
2, which saturates the universal
lowerbound (96). There exist an explicit SRQ bound when ηAL =
1
1+cθ−implying that the above bound
is tight [248].
Sekatski et al. [250] consider another test of nonlocality between (A1, B) where A1 has a continuous
number of settings A1 ≡θ ∈[0, 2π) and they evaluate the following LP quantity
C =
Z dθ
2π
X
a1,b=0,1
(−1)a+b(cθp(a1, b|θ, 0, b) + sθp(a1, b|θ, 1, b))
(102)
and satisfy thr Bell inequality C ≤

√
2
π sin(π T
2 ) where T =
R dθ
2π
P
a1=0,1 p(a1|θ) is the average click
probability of A1 detector. Thanks to this Bell inequality, a strong routed Bell inequality can be proved
as follows [250]
Theorem 6. All SRQ correlations satisfy the following tight routed Bell inequality

The proof of this theorem is based on a steering scenario. Specifically, we first apply the SP-CHSH test
to gather information about Bob’s measurement settings, which is then used to determine whether the
correlations observed in the LP are compatible with a SRQ model (78). For instance, when S0 = 2
√
2, one
can certify that the shared state ρAB is a two-qubit Bell state and Bob’s measurement settings correspond
