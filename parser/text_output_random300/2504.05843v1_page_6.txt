The form of C−1
s
in (26) is apparently a hallmark of a well-chosen basis in all computations with Euler
integrals: the coordinate dependence (27) factors out2 while the differentiation/regularisation parameters
γ, δ, ρ define the core part of the intersection numbers. The necessity of introducing the additional regulator
ρ becomes apparent because without it the matrix would be singular. In comparison, the computations in [6]
involve only one such parameter, which can then be scaled out as well leaving an array of rational numbers.
Let us return to the abstract discussion. The existence of C−1
s
allows us to construct the coefficients ϕ′
L(t)i
in a simple way:
3
X
j = 1
⟨ϕL|hj⟩(C−1
s )ji = ϕ′
L(t)i dt .
(28)
To unclutter the nomenclature we will refer to the ϕ′
L as t-projected left forms. They are three-component
objects. We introduce t-projected right masters, too, though without an explicit left multiplication by C−1
s :
φ′
R(t)i dt = ⟨ei|ϕR⟩,
ϕ′
R = C−1
s φ′
R .
(29)
We further need a 3 × 3 second level connection. Let
∇t = ∂t + ˆωt
(30)
and define
(Ωt)ij =
3
X
k = 1
⟨∇tei|hk⟩(C−1
s )kj .
(31)
where the s intersection number in the angle brackets is constructed just as described for the left forms
themselves, i.e. building a potential and then taking residues in its product with the right level 1 masters. In
the box example, this connection is cumbersome to write out; we rather include it in the ancillary material.
It has poles of maximally first order in t at the points
tm ∈

(32)
which are the singularities to expand around at level 2. By construction, this covers the set of poles in the
t-projected left or right quantities. As before, we will replace t →tm + x and expand in the parameter x.
Also here the pole at infinity cannot be neglected.
For the t intersection numbers we need a potential ψ, too, of which a range of powers min . . . max in x is
needed. It must be a three-component object so that we impose a matrix version of equation (24):
∂v ψ + ψ . Ωt|t = tm+x = ˆϕ′
L|t = tm+x
(33)
where ϕ′
L on the r.h.s. is also the collection of all three components. Their lowest order minm determines
the start of the expansion of the potential, but to be on the safe side we should take the absolute minimum
of the lowest orders estimates of the three components of ϕ′
L, which we call minm −1 again since Ωt as well
as the partial t derivative lower the order in x by 1. On the other hand the maximum order maxm will be
defined by the t-projected right master in question, taking the absolute maximum of the three order estimates
−minm −1 for the individual components.
The second level intersection number is
Ct = ⟨ϕL|ϕR⟩t =
l
X
m = 1
res|t = tm ψ . φ′
R|t = tm+x
(34)
with ψ defined by (33). Here ϕL and ϕR are any member of larger bases of masters completing the level 1
bases of length 3. For true bases, Ct will be invertible, too.
Any two-form can be decomposed in terms of the second level left basis using
ϕ = ⟨ϕ | h ⟩C−1
t
,
(35)
where h is the full level 2 right basis. In particular, this is so for derivatives of the left masters wrt. outer
parameters. Let
My = ⟨(∂y + ˆωy) e | h ⟩C−1
t
,
ˆωy = ∂y log(w) .
(36)
2From the point of view of the s-integration, t is an outer variable like z, ¯z.
