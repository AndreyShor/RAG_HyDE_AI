LOW REGULARITY OF THE RIEMANN SOLUTIONS FOR THE ISENTROPIC EULER SYSTEM

given in condition (v) of Definition 3.1 and assumption (i) of Theorem 3.2, we see that (v1 ·
τ S)(P1) = (v · τ S)(P1) ̸= 0. This implies that Q ̸= P1. Also, since ˆQ ̸= P ∗as we discussed
above, then Q ̸= P ∗for the present case. Thus, for the present case Q = ˆQ, it follows that Q is
an interior point of Γint
1 , and the part of Γint
1
between P1 and Q lies on the straight line S. In
particular, line S is tangential to Γint
1
at Q. We now shift and rotate the coordinates to have the
origin at Q and the coordinates ξ1 and ξ2 to be along S and L, respectively. Then O1 = (0, ˜v1)
for some ˜v1 ∈R (in fact, ˜v1 ̸= 0 by condition (v) of Definition 3.1, but this will not be used
below). To fix notation, let the ξ1–axis along S be oriented so that P1 = (ξP1, 0) with ξP1 < 0.
Since S = {ξ2 = 0} is tangential to Γint
1
at Q = (0, 0), then curve Γint
1
∩Br(Q) is a graph for
some r > 0: There exists f ∈C2(R) such that
Γint
1
∩Br(Q) =

(ξ1, f(ξ1)) : ξ1 ∈(a, b)
	
for some a < 0, b > 0, and f ≡0 on (a, 0),
where the last assertion holds because Γint
1
lies on S between P1 and Q. Thus, f′(0) = f′′(0) = 0
so that |f′(ξ1)| ≤O(ε)ξ1 for all ξ1 ∈(−ε, ε), where O(ε) →0 as ε →0+.
For any P =
(ξ1, f(ξ1)) ∈Γint
1
∩Br(Q), we have
v1(P) = O1 −P = (−ξ1, ˜v2 −f(ξ1)),
τ(P) =
(1, f′(ξ1))
p
1 + (f′(ξ1))2 .
Then
(v1 · τ)(P) = −ξ1 + (˜v2 −f(ξ1))f′(ξ1)
p
1 + (f′(ξ1))2
= −ξ1 + O(ε)ξ1
p
1 + (f′(ξ1))2 ̸= 0
for ξ1 ∈(0, ε) if ε is small.
Thus, v · τ = v1 · τ ̸= 0 at any P = (ξ1, f(ξ1)) with ξ1 ∈(0, ε). Since ˆQ = Q, i.e., for every
ε > 0, there exists a point ξ1 ∈(0, ε) such that Γint
1
has non-zero curvature at P = (ξ1, f(ξ1)),
it follows that there exists a point ˆP, at which the tangential velocity and the curvature of Γint
1
are nonzero, in the present case. This completes the proof.

4.1. Lower Regularity of the Regular Shock Reflection Solutions for the Isentropic
Euler System. The first Riemann problem we address is the regular shock reflection problem
for the isentropic Euler system (2.1). When a plane incident shock S0 := Γ0
shock hits a two-
dimensional wedge, a shock reflection-diffraction configuration takes shape. The incident shock
S0 separates two constant states: state (0) with velocity u(0) = (0, 0) and density ρ0 ahead of
the shock, and state (1) with velocity u(1) = (u(1)
1 , 0) and density ρ1 behind the shock, where
ρ1 > ρ0, and u(1)
1
> 0 is determined by (ρ0, ρ1, γ) through the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions on
S0. The incident shock S0 moves in the direction of the x1–axis and hits the wedge vertex at
the initial time. The slip boundary condition u · ν = 0 is prescribed on the wedge boundary,
where u is the velocity of gas. Since state (1) does not satisfy the boundary condition, the
shock reflection-diffraction configuration occurs at later time, which is self-similar. Depending
on the flow parameters and the wedge angle, there may be various patterns of shock reflection-
diffraction configurations, including Regular Reflection and Mach Reflection.
The regular reflection problem is a lateral Riemann problem in the region
Λ = R2
+ \

x : x1 > 0, 0 < x2 < x1 tan θw
	
,
where R2
+ = R2 ∩{x1 > 0}. We seek functions (ρ, u)(x, t) satisfying system (2.1) in Λ with the
boundary condition u · ν = 0 on ∂Λ and the initial data:
(ρ, u)(x, 0) =
(
(ρ0, u(0))
if x ∈Λ ∩{x1 < 0},
(ρ1, u(1))
if x ∈Λ ∩{x1 > 0}.
This initial-boundary value problem is invariant under scaling (2.2), so we seek self-similar
solutions (ρ, v) = (ρ, v)(ξ), where the self-similar variables ξ and the pseudo-velocity v = u −ξ
are introduced in §2.1.
