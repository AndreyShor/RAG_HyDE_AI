Given that the sequence (Pn−1

integer K such that

and we can conclude from

Assuming K > 2n, we end up with a quadratic equation in K:
K2 + (−4n −4 ln(m/2)) K + 4n2 + 4n ln(m/2) > 0
for which the smallest integer solution is
K =

We can compute numerically the exact depth, the best solution to inequality A5 and the analytical estimation of
Eq. A6. We plot these values for various values of m in the case n = 40 and for various values of n for m = 3000.
They are represented in Figure 12. Overall the bounds follow a similar behavior and are quite tight.
