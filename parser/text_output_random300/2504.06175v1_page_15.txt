collection of the Pauli errors not caught by recurrence are
detailed in Table I. In this table, the first column denotes
errors on qubits 2 and 3 that commute with Z2Z3, and
are thus not post-selected away by recurrence, the sec-
ond column denotes the probability of these errors, and
the third column denotes the effective error after post-
selection on qubit labelled 2. Setting px = py = pz = p/3
and qx = qy = qz = q/3 and summing the entries in the
second column gives the acceptance probability ps (6)
while summing those entries in the second column where
the effective error is I2 and normalizing by ps gives the
Bell fidelity of the distilled state Fa (5).

Sec. II A), their probability, and their effect on the final dis-
tilled Bell pair.
For the ZX3B distillation protocol, we may derive the
acceptance probability ps in (9) and Bell fidelity upon
acceptance Fb in (8) using a procedure analogous to the
one above. Suppose in Fig. 2c
ρ03 = I ⊗Pp(ρ),
ρ14 = I ⊗Pq(ρ),
and
ρ25 = I ⊗Pr(ρ).

then we list the collection of errors not caught by the
ZX3B distillation protocol in Table II. In this table,
the first, second and third column represent the ac-
cepted errors (those which commute with both Z3Z4Z5
and X4X5), their probability and their effect on qubit
3 after qubits 4 and 5 are measured, respectively. Set-
ting px = py = pz = rx = ry = rz = p/3, and
qx = qy = qz = q/3 and summing the entries in the sec-
ond column gives the acceptance probability, ps in (9),
while summing the entries in the second column corre-
sponding to no error (I) in the third and normalizing by
ps gives the fidelity after distillation, Fa in (8).

Experiments were carried out on IBM’s fixed-frequency
transmon superconducting processor, ibm kyiv. This is a
127 qubit chip with qubits arranged in a heavy-hexagonal
lattice which reduces cross-talk with reasonable over-
head in circuit layout mapping. This processor is from

TABLE II. Accepted errors by ZX3B and their effect: Pauli

Sec. II B), their probability, and their effect on the final dis-

IBM’s Eagle processor family which use the echoed cross-
resonance gate for its entangling gate and features mul-
tiplexed readout. To support the higher qubit count, the
chip features multi-layer wiring with care taken to reduce
the effects of quantum and classical cross-talk. This ar-
chitecture results in a median T1 and T2 of 276 µs and 122
µs respectively and median ECR gate error and readout
error of 1.1×10−2 and 6.0×10−3 respectively. Tables III,
IV, V, and VI give error parameters for specific qubits
on which distillation experiments and simulation were
discussed in the main text.
