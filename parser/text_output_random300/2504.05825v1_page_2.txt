Introduction 
Quantum plasmas have gained significant attention due to their unique attributes, which 
arise from quantum mechanical effects. These effects become prominent when the de-Broglie 
wavelength of charged particles approaches inter-particle spacing [1-3]. Quantum plasmas are 
present in various environments, ranging from dense astrophysical settings to laboratory 
conditions. These include active galactic cores [4], pulsar magnetospheres [5], black hole 
accretion discs [6], white dwarf atmospheres [7, 8], the Van Allen radiation belts [9], the early 
universe [10], and the center of our galaxy [11]. In such environments, quantum effects become 
critical due to the high density and rotation, making quantum plasma phenomena an important 
subject of study [12, 13]. 
In astrophysical contexts, plasmas often experience rapid rotation, particularly in objects 
like white dwarfs, neutron stars, and pulsars [14]. As these objects collapse, their moment of 
inertia decreases, leading to rapid rotation due to the conservation of angular momentum. This 
rotation, coupled with the conservation of magnetic flux and strong magnetic fields, results in the 
formation of highly dense, rotating, magnetized plasma [15]. The Coriolis force in these rotating 
environments can create an effect analogous to a magnetic field, further complicating the plasma 
dynamics [16]. 
A subset of these plasmas is electron-positron-ion (e-p-i) plasmas, where positrons, due 
to their equal mass and charge magnitude to electrons, introduce unique dynamics compared to 
typical electron-ion systems [17-21]. The study of electrostatic waves in rotating quantum e-p-i 
plasma is critical, especially as ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) and magnetosonic waves become 
central to understanding wave propagation in these systems [22-25]. Ion temperature, pressure
