The bound marginal validity holds when the data generating distribution of
the calibration and test sets, {(Yn, ˆYn)}N
n=1 and (YN+1, ˆYN+1), are exchange-
able. In this case, (6) is guaranteed by the definition of the empirical quantile
of exchangeable samples. See Lemma 1 of Tibshirani et al. (2019) for a sim-
ple proof of the quantile lemma and Vovk et al. (2005) or Angelopoulos and
Bates (2021) for a smooth introduction to CP.
Central to any CP algorithm is a scoring function, or conformity score,
A, which measures the quality of an output given the corresponding label.
In our case,
An = BC(ˆYn, Yn),
n = 1, . . . N

In practice, (6) is obtained by finding an upper bound for AN+1(Y ) =
BC(ˆYN+1, Y ), where Y represent any sN+1- dimensional random variable
within distance Qα from the unknown ideal output, YN+1.

BC conformal extrapolation
Let Z1, . . . , ZN and ZN+1 be the features of N quantum circuits that can be
simulated on a classical machine and a large circuit that can not. The N
tractable circuits are run on quantum hardware and a classical simulator to
produce ˆYnm and Ynm, where n = 1, . . . , N and m = 1 . . . , Mshots. The N + 1-
th circuit can not be simulated classically but can be run on the quantum
hardware to obtain ˆY(N+1) m, m = 1 . . . , Mshots. As the (N+1)-th circuit may
be much more noisy than the others the conformity scores An = BC(Yn, ˆYn),
n = 1, . . . , N and AN+1 = BC(YN+1, ˆYN+1) may be non-exchangeable. In
