regime of fast chemical kinetics, κτ > 1, where the reaction rate exceeds spin
decoherence rate, the critical magnetic ﬁeld condition becomes γH ∼κ, deﬁning
the threshold for observing signiﬁcant magnetic eﬀects.
In conclusion, an analytical solution (3) to the master equation (2) has been
found above for a system consisting of two electrons and a nucleus, with the
Zeeman and hyperﬁne interactions, taking into account quantum coherence re-
laxation and chemical kinetics for the case of equal rates in the singlet and
triplet channels. It has been shown that the magnetic RPM eﬀects can only be
noticeable when the fundamental inequality (7) is satisﬁed. This relationship,
which is implicitly present in the RPM, is consistent with the experience of spin
chemistry. If at least one of the rates of chemical processes and spin decoherence
is high, the magnetic eﬀect will not be signiﬁcant.
