These Hamiltonians are not at an EP for ε ̸= 0. The
eigenvalues are E± = ±√ε and the eigenstates are
|ψ±⟩= (1, ±√ε)T. The tensor product of these states
gives the eigenstates (up to normalization) with zero
eigenvalue

In the limiting case ε →0 all four eigenstates converge
to the EP eigenstate in Eq. (3). This appears to be an
unambiguous signature of a fourth-order EP. The fallacy
lies in the eigenvalue degeneracy of the eigenstates in
Eq. (9), which allows for alternative linear combinations
such as
| ˜ψ0⟩=



The eigenstate | ˜ψ0⟩does not converge to the EP eigen-
state in Eq. (3). Instead, it is equal the isolated eigen-
state in Eq. (5). This observation is quite remarkable. It
demonstrates that the more complex degeneracies con-
sisting of an EP and other states can complicate analy-
sis and the physical interpretation. Our general theory,
which will be presented in the next section, is immune to
the pitfalls presented above.

GENERAL THEORY
A.
Preliminaries
A non-Hermitian m×m Hamiltonian can be expanded
as [11]
ˆH =
X
l
(El ˆPl + ˆNl)
(12)
where l = 1, 2, . . . runs over the relevant part of the point
spectrum El including isolated energy eigenvalues and
EPs. The operators ˆPl are projectors onto the general-
ized eigenspaces of the corresponding eigenvalues El with
ˆPj ˆPl = δjl ˆPl
(13)
and Kronecker delta δjl. The ˆPl are not orthogonal pro-
jectors in general, i.e., ˆPl ̸= ˆP †
l . The operators ˆNl for a
given EP of order nl are nilpotent operators of index nl;
hence, ˆN nl
l
= 0 but ˆN nl−1
l
̸= 0. It holds
ˆPl ˆNl = ˆNl ˆPl = ˆNl.
(14)
The m×m Green’s function of the general Hamiltonian ˆH
can be expanded as [11]
ˆG(E) =
X
l
"
ˆPl
E −El
+
nl
X
k=2
ˆN k−1
l
(E −El)k
#
.
(15)
For an energy E ≈EEP close to an EP energy EEP = El,
the contribution of the Green’s function with k = nl is
the dominant one.
Using this Green’s function it has
been shown in Ref. [40] that for a generic perturbation
ˆH + ε ˆHp with small perturbation strength ε > 0, the
following inequality holds for the split eigenvalues ˜Ej,
j = 1, . . . , nl, of the perturbed Hamiltonian
| ˜Ej −EEP|nl ≤ε|| ˆHp||2 ξ
(16)
with the spectral norm (operator norm) ||·||2 [56] and the
so-called spectral response strength
ξ = || ˆN nl−1
l
||2.
(17)
The spectral response strength is a measure of how
strongly a non-Hermitian system with an EP reacts to
a perturbation [39]. It has been calculated and discussed
for various systems [57, 58].
The relation to the Pe-
termann factor is discussed in Refs. [59, 60]. Recently,
a scheme for the computation of the spectral response
strength directly from numerical wave simulations has
been presented [61].

Existence of an higher-order EP
For the sake of simplicity, we initially consider a com-
posite quantum system consisting of two quantum sys-
tems A and B. The Hilbert space of the former is mA-
dimensional and that of the latter is mB-dimensional.
The tensor product of these two spaces gives the Hilbert
space of the composite system with dimension m =
mAmB. The m×m Hamiltonian of the composite system
is given by the Kronecker sum in Eq. (1) with ˆHA being
the mA ×mA-Hamiltonian and 1A the mA ×mA-identity
of the system A and analogue for ˆHB and 1B.
One of our basic assumptions is that the relevant part
of the spectrum of systems A and B is completely de-
generated both with the same eigenvalue E0. The latter
naturally occurs when the systems are identical, as for
example in Ref. [47]. However, we do not impose this as
a restriction. With the above assumption, the algebraic
multiplicity of the degeneracy is αA = mA for system A
and αB = mB for system B. Using the fact that the eigen-
values of a matrix ˆA = ˆB ⊕ˆC are given by bi + cj where
