The initial step is to ascertain the square root of the complex number. For the sake of
clarity and concision in subsequent equations, it is expedient to introduce a parameter 𝑅to
represent the real part of this square root.

Under sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the pressure parameter 𝛽becomes negligible in
magnitude and leads to the dominance of the linear terms in equation (3.1). Consequently,
solitary and shock wave-like disappear, giving way to harmonic wave solutions expressible in
terms of trigonometric functions. The strong magnetic field not only stimulates trigonometric
waves, but it also decreases their amplitudes. This further illustrates the significant interaction
between the magnetic field and the boundary layer flow.
