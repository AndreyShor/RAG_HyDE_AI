details of these parity check matrices are presented in
Table I while, for the sake of comparison, the storage for
each matrix is described by the red points in the bot-
tom panel. We see that the results are very close to the
predicted values for Msparse. Finally, in Appendix C, we
examine the behaviour of the protocols in terms of losses
when one considers diﬀerent values for block size, suc-
cessful EC probability, and digitization.

CONCLUSION
Small device detectors and IoT device networks play a
crucial role in modern society, enabling real-time moni-
toring, automation, and seamless connectivity across var-
ious sectors, including healthcare, smart cities, indus-
trial automation, and environmental monitoring. Their
ability to collect and process vast amounts of data en-
hances eﬃciency, reduces human intervention, and sup-
ports decision-making in critical applications. However,
as these devices become deeply integrated into daily life,
their security is of paramount importance. Cyber threats
targeting IoT networks can lead to privacy breaches,
unauthorized surveillance, or even large-scale disruptions
in infrastructure, posing risks to public safety and eco-
nomic stability.
It is paramount then to search for robust solutions
against cyber threats for these devices: one of the main
candidates is QKD oﬀering an information-theoretic se-
curity advantage. Since these devices operate at short
distances, such as within a room, a house, or a ware-
house, CV-QKD which has an advantage in this regime
and especially the GMCS protocols can provide higher se-
cret key rates. In particular, by using non-binary LDPC
codes in a practical implementation of such a protocol,
the parties exploit the high mutual information between
their continuous variables.
However, this is quite challenging due to the increased
requirements of the data post-processing stage in compu-
tational power or storage, not to mention implementing
a QKD protocol on such constrained devices in the ﬁrst
place. Therefore, in order to investigate the performance
under those circumstances, one needs to develop rigor-
ous theoretical tools. Here we have combined a compos-
able security proof taking into account the main stages
of the data post-processing of a QKD protocol with a
tight bound for EC adapting it to the non-binary LDPC
regime.
This allows us to predict optimal secret key perfor-
mance in terms of reconciliation eﬃciency and leakage
and match this performance to operational code rates
for given signal-to-noise ratios and error correction suc-
cess probabilities.
Based on this, we developed a tool
that models the encoding storage requirements for a non-
binary LDPC EC associated with the given secret key
rate performance.
We combined a composable security framework for the
secret key rate of the GMCS protocols with a ﬁnite-size
tight bound for one-way EC leakage of non-binary LDPC
dependent on the given SNR and successful EC proba-
bility.
Through this tool, one can theoretically calcu-
late the code rate for close to optimum performance and
the dimensions of the associated parity-check matrix. In
turn, one may calculate the storage requirements of the
EC encoding process, which is crucial, for example, for
the implementation of CV-QKD with constraint devices.
Note here that optimum leakage means optimum value
for storage.
CODE AND NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION
The majority of the numerical results and plots in this
manuscript were produced using custom Python code de-
veloped for the calculation of tight leakage bounds in the
context of non-binary LDPC codes. This code represents
a central technical contribution of the present work and
is publicly available at: eqclabs/tight_bound_leakage.
The three red data points in Fig. 3 were obtained using an
independent implementation, as referenced in the main
text.
All simulations were performed on nodes of the
Viking High Performance Computing cluster at the Uni-
versity of York, equipped with a 2-core AMD EPYC3
7643 processor and 12 GB of memory. All repositories
