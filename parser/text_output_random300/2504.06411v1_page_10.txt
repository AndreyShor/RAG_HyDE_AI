Lemma 4.1. Let Γ be an admissible semimartingale on M. Suppose U is any chart on M and identify with
PU with U × Rn × Rn. Set K = ¯U × Rn × Rn. If ϵ 7→Γϵ,t = (qϵ,t, vϵ,t, pϵ,t) is a K-deformation of Γ such that
δqt vanishes at t = 0 and t = T then

0 G ◦dΓ. In local coordinates ⟨G(Γt), δΓt⟩= ⟨pt, δqt⟩. Since δqt = 0 at t = 0
and t = T, by Lemma 3.1 and 3.2 we have

Let (q, v, p) ∈PU ∼= U×Rn×Rn. Suppose ( ˙q, ˙v, ˙p), (wq, wv, wp) ∈T(q,v,p)M. From the local coordinate expression
of G in Eq. (7), it follows that G(q, v, p) = pdq. Hence
dG(q, v, p) =
dim Q
X
i=1
dpi ∧dqi,
which yields
i(wq,wv,wp)dG( ˙q, ˙v, ˙p) = dG(q, v, p)((wq, wv, wp), ( ˙q, ˙v, ˙p)) = ⟨wp, ˙q⟩−⟨wq, ˙p⟩.

Remark 4.1. The product rule is often used to prove the above lemma. For a K-deformation ϵ 7→Γϵ such that
δqt vanishes at t = 0 and t = T we have
