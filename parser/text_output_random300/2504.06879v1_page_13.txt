Therefore, this methodology of constructing an inverse scattering potential based on piece wise smooth Morse
function as a reference potential and employing PFM with a genetic algorithm for optimization is successful in
explaining the experimental outcomes of alpha-deuteron scattering.

Conclusion
• This study confirms the dominant characteristics of ℓ= 2 wave in alpha-deutron scattering system of 6Li,
supporting the idea that its structure is best described as an alpha core(4He)+2 valence nucleons(1p + 1n) in
a p-state. The coupling of these valence nucleons to the core leads to ℓ= 2 (D-wave) and S=1(triplet state),
resulting in triplet D-state 3D1, 3D2, 3D3.
• The proposed methodology effectively overcomes the longstanding challenge of simultaneously incorporating
long-range Coulomb interactions and short-range nuclear forces in the construction of a physically accurate
scattering potential. By embedding the Coulomb effects directly into the reference potential, it avoids the
need for separate treatments or approximations, resulting in a more accurate and physically consistent repre-
sentation of the interaction dynamics.
• The main advantage of this approach is the direct determination of the Scattering Phase Shifts (SPS) using the
Phase Function Method (PFM), where the interaction potential appears as a multiplicative function. This
eliminates the need to solve for the full wave function, significantly simplifying the computational process
while maintaining accuracy.
• The inverse scattering theory, when implemented computationally via the reference potential approach along
with the phase function method, is effectively equivalent to the Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML)
paradigm. In this framework, the underlying physical laws guide the machine learning algorithm to optimize
the parameters of the reference potential. This enables the simulation of a broad spectrum of potential shapes
across the solution space, from which the algorithm systematically converges to the optimal model potential
that best reproduces the scattering data.
• Predictive power of genetic algorithms comes from their inherent flexibility in handling diverse data types and
model structures, as well as their capacity to perform global searches across complex solution spaces rather
than getting stuck in local optima. Because of its ability to adaptively refine solutions, we can predict the
data at low energy and calculate the accurate resonance energy and decay width through the cross-section
calculations.
• The observed decay widths are consistent with the wigner limit, indicating that the triplet D states have
a strong spatial overlap with the alpha-deuteron cluster configuration. Additionally, the absence of strong
negative parity suggests that the dominant structure of 6Li is a positive parity D-wave state.
Overall, the findings provide significant insight into the nuclear structure and clustering effects in 6Li, contributing
to a deeper understanding of light nuclei and their interaction dynamics. Our findings have substantial implications
