Problem Statement
You are provided with a PROBLEM DESCRIPTION and a TARGET DESCRIPTION.
This is a problem that will likely require solving the partial differential equations
that describe the system using finite element analysis. You may use numpy or scipy,
which have been preinstalled. Do not use any other packages unless absolutely
necessary. First generate the Python code to solve this problem in ‘main.py‘.
You must then execute the code and compute the target value corresponding to
TARGET DESCRIPTION. This target value needs to be exported to a file called
‘output.txt‘ along with its units. For example, if the target value you compute is
‘30 K‘, ‘output.txt‘ should have a single line saying ‘30 K‘. If the code executed
successfully, read in the ‘output.txt‘ file and check whether the computed value
seems reasonable according to your analytical guess.

Evaluate Target Validity
You are provided with the contents of a file exported by Python code used to solve a
problem. The contents * should * contain the EXPECTED TARGET QUANTITY. If
the code is incorrect, the contents of the file may be empty or might export a physical
quantity that is different from the expected target quantity.
Carefully examine the ‘OUTPUT‘ and compare it with the units and description
of the expected target quantity and the numbers in ‘PROBLEM‘ to assess whether
the table exported a value that was the result of genuinely numerically solving the
problem. You must return TARGET VALUE and TARGET UNITS in json format if
the output was the result of genuinely solving the problem, computing a solution
and exporting it. Return ‘N/A‘ for both fields, otherwise.
