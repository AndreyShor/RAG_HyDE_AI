First, consider the problem with an assumption on the symmetry with respect to the x1–
axis. Then we can consider only the upper half-plane {x2 > 0} and prescribe the slip boundary
condition u · ν = 0 on the symmetry line {x2 = 0}, so that there is only one reflection point P0
to be considered (see Figs 4.1–4.2).
The regular shock reflection-diffraction configuration is characterized by the fact that the
reflection occurs at point P0 of the intersection of the incident shock with the wedge boundary.
Figs. 4.1–4.2 show the structure of regular shock reflection-diffraction configurations in self-
similar coordinates.
A necessary condition for the existence of a regular reflection-diffraction configuration is the
existence of the constant state (2) and the reflected shock line such that state (2) satisfies both
the slip boundary condition on the wedge and the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions (2.9)–(2.10) on
the shock with state (1) across the reflected shock line written at P0. These conditions lead to
a system of algebraic equations for the constant velocity and density of state (2). Moreover, the
entropy condition (2.8) becomes an inequality in terms of the parameters of states (1) and (2).
It is well-known (see e.g. [15, Chapter 18] for the full Euler system case; the argument for the
isentropic Euler system case is similar) that, given the parameters of states (0) and (1), there
exists a detachment angle θd
w ∈(0, π
2 ) such that the system of algebraic equations for parameters
of state (2) has two solutions for each wedge angle θw ∈(θd
w, π
2 ) such that the entropy condition
(2.8) is satisfied for the resulting two-shock configuration. These two solutions become equal
when θw = θd
w. Thus, two types of two-shock configurations occur at P0 for each θw ∈(θd
w, π
2 ).
For such θw, state (2) with the smaller density is called a weak state (2). It is expected that the
weak state (2) is physical, while the strong state (2) is not stable as the wedge angle tends to π
2
(as shown in [14] for the potential flow case). In the case of the potential flow model, the global
existence of regular shock reflection solutions for all θw ∈(θd
w, π
2 ) with (ρ, u) at P0 determined
by the weak states (2) has been established in [14,15]. For the full or isentropic Euler system,
the existence of regular reflection solutions is an outstanding open problem. From now on, state
(2) always refers to the weak state (2), which is unique for each θw ∈(θd
w, π
2 ).
Furthermore, it follows from the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions (2.9)–(2.10) on the straight
shock S1 := Γ1
shock between states (1) and (2), the slip boundary condition on the wedge for
state (2), v1(ξ) = (u(1)
1 , 0) −ξ, and v2(ξ) = u2 −ξ that
The shock line S1 between states (1) and (2) is not vertical for all θw ∈(θd
w, π
2 ).

Moreover, from the entropy condition (2.12) on S1, we have
ρ2 > ρ1.

Depending on the wedge angle, state (2) can be either supersonic or subsonic at P0, i.e.,
either |v2(P0)| > c2 or the opposite inequality holds, where c2 = ρ
γ−1

is the (constant) speed of
sound of state (2). Moreover, for θw near π
2 (resp. for θw near θd
w), state (2) is supersonic (resp.
