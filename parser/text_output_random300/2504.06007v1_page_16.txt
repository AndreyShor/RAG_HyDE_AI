CAMulator Deficiencies and Future Improvements
Despite these strengths, several key deficiencies remain, highlighting areas for future development.
• High-latitude biases due to missing cryospheric processes: The absence of interactive sea and land ice, and
the limited representation of its change in the training period leads to a persistent cold bias, particularly in
boreal winter. This bias is most pronounced in later periods and becomes apparent in seasonal temperature
cycles (Supplemental Fig. 17S). The lack of explicit ice-feedbacks and phase transition processes likely
contributes to this discrepancy, especially in polar regions.
• Muted ENSO-related variability: While CAMulator successfully captures the broad-scale atmospheric
response to ENSO events, it underestimates the magnitude of certain ENSO-related variability. This is
particularly evident in the integrated atmospheric heat content during strong ENSO events, such as the 1997/98
El Niño (Fig. 2). Improved representation of coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions and internal variability
could enhance this response.
• Challenges in extrapolating to extreme SST perturbations: CAMulator’s response to out-of-distribution
SST forcing (+2K and +4K) diverges from CAM6, which suggests that while the model generalizes well
within its training range, it struggles with conditions that require dynamically consistent extrapolation. Future
improvements to training strategies, including exposure to a broader range of climate states and variables, may
mitigate this issue.
To address these limitations, several promising research directions should be explored:
• Coupling CAMulator with an interactive ocean, sea ice, and land model: Incorporating dynamic surface
processes would improve the representation of feedback mechanisms, particularly in polar regions, and help
resolve biases associated with missing feedback states. We hope that these models could be both physics-based
and machine learned [e.g., Dheeshjith et al., 2024].
• Enhancing variability through stochastic parameterizations: Training CAMulator with a Stochastic Kinetic
Energy Backscatter Scheme [SKEBS; Berner et al., 2009] or a similar approach could improve CAMulator’s
ability to represent subgrid-scale variability, potentially addressing the muted ENSO and NAO responses.
• Exploring supermodeling approaches: One promising avenue is to integrate CAMulator with multiple
ML-based emulators coupled to a single dynamical model, allowing for dynamic state corrections and
improved climate change projections [e.g., Schevenhoven et al., 2023]. Such a framework could enhance the
representation of future warming scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Broader Implications and Future Outlook
The ability of CAMulator to rapidly emulate atmospheric states while conserving fundamental physical properties
makes it an attractive tool for accelerating climate simulations, uncertainty quantification, and data assimilation.
Furthermore, its differentiability opens new opportunities for inverse modeling and sensitivity analyses, potentially
improving parameter estimation in Earth system models.
As ML-driven climate modeling continues to evolve, hybrid approaches that combine data-driven methods with
traditional physics-based models will likely become increasingly valuable. CAMulator provides a foundation for
such efforts, demonstrating that machine-learned emulators can maintain physical fidelity while offering substantial
computational advantages. By incorporating additional coupling mechanisms and improving variability representation,
future iterations of CAMulator could play a critical role in next-generation climate modeling, bridging the gap between
computational efficiency and physical realism.
