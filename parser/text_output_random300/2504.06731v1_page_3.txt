A matrix M is Schur stable if ρ(M) < 1, where ρ(M) is the spectral radius, i.e., the largest modulus of M’s
eigenvalues. The well-known Perron–Frobenius theorem [42] states that for any nonnegative matrix M ≥0, the
spectral radius ρ(M) is a (real) eigenvalue of M. A matrix M ≥0 is (row) stochastic if M1 = 1, and (row)
substochastic if M1 ≤1.
Using the Ger˘sgorin disk theorem [42], it is easy to verify that ρ(M) ≤1 for all
substochastic matrices, and ρ(M) = 1 if M is stochastic.
A (weighted directed) graph is defined by the triple G[W] = (V, E, W), where the set of nodes V = {1, . . . , n}
represents the individuals (agents), the set of directed edges E ⊆V × V indicates the presence of social influence,
and W = (wij) ≥0 is the weighted n×n adjacency matrix such that wij > 0 if and only if (i, j) ∈E. Additionally, a
binary adjacency matrix B ∈{0, 1}n×n can also be introduced with bij = 1 if and only if wij > 0. For two matrices
W 1, W 2 ≥0, the graph G[W 1 + W 2] corresponds to the union of two graphs G[W 1] and G[W 2].

The FJ and FJ-MM Models
Henceforth, we consider a social group where each agent i is characterized at each discrete timestep t by a scalar
state xi(t) ∈R, interpreted as their opinion on a particular topic. The overall network state at time t is represented
by the vector x(t) = [x1(t), . . . , xn(t)]⊤∈Rn.
The classical FJ model [1,12] is defined by three components: the stochastic influence matrix W = (wij) ∈Rn×n,
the diagonal susceptibility matrix Λ ∈Rn×n with entries λii ∈[0, 1], and the vector of innate opinions s ∈Rn. The
model assumes that opinions evolve according to the following update rule:
xi(t + 1) = λii¯xi(t) + (1 −λii)si, ¯xi(t) :=
n
X
j=1
wijxj(t).
(1)
In other words, at each step of the opinion update, an agent’s new opinion is determined by their innate opinion
si and the weighted average of their own and others’ opinions, ¯xi(t). The weight wij > 0, assigned by agent i
to agent j, reflects i’s appraisal of j—such as recognition of expertise or trust. The coefficient λii represents an
agent’s openness to assimilating others’ opinions, or their susceptibility to social influence. An agent with λii = 0
is considered ’totally stubborn’, fully anchored to their innate opinion si, while λii = 1 corresponds to the classical
French–DeGroot model, where opinions are updated solely through iterative averaging. In compact matrix form,
the state vector x(t) evolves according to the following dynamics:
x(t + 1) = ΛWx(t) + (I −Λ)s,
∀t = 0, 1, . . .
(2)
The properties of the FJ model have been studied in [1,15,17,25,43], to mention a few.
In this paper, we focus on an extended version of the FJ model, where the average of current opinions from (1),
¯xi(t), computed by each agent i, is expanded to incorporate some opinions from previous steps as follows:
¯xi(t) =

accommodate communication delays, it is not motivated by them; rather, it aims to capture the effects of memory
and multi-hop influence, thereby justifying the acronym FJ-MM.
Definition 1 (FJ-MM). The system (4), defined by the diagonal matrix 0 ≤Λ ≤In and nonnegative matrices
W (ℓ), ℓ= 1, . . . , L, whose sum W (1) + . . . + W (L) is a stochastic matrix, is referred to as the FJ-MM model.
Note that the classical FJ model includes the French–DeGroot dynamics as a special case in which all agents
are maximally susceptible, i.e., Λ = In. In the FJ-MM model, this corresponds to the French–DeGroot dynamics
with memory—a model that has been studied in the context of delay robustness in consensus algorithms [30].
Remarkably, delay can even facilitate consensus in the presence of periodic communication graphs [44], where the
undelayed DeGroot model is known to oscillate. In this paper, we are primarily interested in the generic case where
the FJ-MM dynamics is asymptotically stable, which is only possible when λii < 1 for at least one agent i.
We now present two remarks regarding the choice of initial condition and the Lyapunov stability of the FJ-MM.
