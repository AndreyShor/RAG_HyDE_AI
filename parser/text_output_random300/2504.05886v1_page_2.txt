(a) Individual particles live on a two-dimensional
lattice with volume exclusion and can interact with the four
nearest neighbours. Three species of particles exhibit cyclic
dominance, where the arrows indicate predation. (b) Dynam-

predation, reproduction, and movement. (c) Individual par-

This paper is organised as follows. We describe the
model definition and simulation methods in Sec. II. We
present the phase behaviour of this model in Sec. III. We
discuss the reinforcement learning algorithm in Sec. IV
and show its results in Sec. V. Building on these results,
Sec. VI explores in more detail the optimal strategies and
the mechanisms by which the smart species increases its
population. We conclude our study in Sec. VII.
II.
MODEL
A.
Model Definition
We consider a model with three species of particles
(A, B, C) on a two-dimensional square lattice of size L×L
with periodic boundary conditions. Each lattice site can
be occupied by a single particle (A, B, C) or be vacant
(∅), see Fig. 1(a). We adopt throughout this work the
convention that species A, B, C are coloured red, blue,
and yellow, respectively. The particle dynamics is a gen-
eralisation of the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) system of [7],
and is also related to the May-Leonard model [5]. The
species undergo predation, reproduction, and movement
with rates σ, µ, λ respectively: these involve interactions
with their nearest neighbours on the lattice, summarised
as:
AB
σA
−−→A∅,
BC
σB
−−→B∅,
CA
σC
−−→C∅,
A∅
µA
−−→AA
B∅
µB

(1)
where S may be any species, or an empty site.
This
scheme allows for different species to have different
rates for predation/reproduction/movement, for exam-
ple, σA, σB, σC. Note that the predation mechanism de-
scribes the cyclic domination among the three species: A
dominates (predates on) B, also B dominates C, and C
dominates A. Due to the volume exclusion rule, repro-
duction can only be performed when the neighbouring
site is empty. We use X to denote a generic species and
we write ηX(r) for the number of particles of species X
at position r.
In the following, we will allow a privileged (“smart”)
species to adjust its predation and movement rates, to
optimise its population. To ensure that this optimisation
problem captures the main challenges facing real species,
we introduce two extra model features. First, we intro-
duce spontaneous death: each particle dies with rate ω,
independent of its species and its environment
A
ω−→∅,
B
ω−→∅,
C
ω−→∅.

Second, we incorporate that particles must consume food
in order to reproduce. This is achieved by endowing each
particle with a hunger level, with higher levels being the
most hungry. These are denoted by primes on the particle
species: A0 for level 0, A′ for level 1, A′′ for level 2. Each
particle increases its hunger stage with rate h: for species
A we have
A0
h−→A′
h−→A′′,
(3)
with similar processes for species B, C. (The parameter
h is the same for all species.) A particle’s hunger level
is reset to zero when it undergoes a predation step and
particles are born in a hungry state (see below for fur-
ther details). We take level 2 as the highest hunger level
and we refer to particles in this level as hungry particles.
These particles have a reduced reproduction rate
µ′′
X = HµX
(4)
where H is called the hunger reproduction factor and X
may be any of A, B, C.
There are obvious generalisations to include more
hunger levels, and to have reproduction rates with more
complicated dependence on the hunger level, or indeed
to have other rates dependent on this level.
The key
point for this work is that a system with only one species
must converge to a state where all particles are hungry:
if one has additionally µ′′ < ω then these particles die
faster than they can reproduce, so the system will tend
to an extinct state with no particles at all. This ensures
a non-trivial optimisation problem for the smart species,
in that they can only survive as long as sufficient prey
is available for them to eat. (This situation is also more
realistic in the ecological setting.)
To summarise these changes to the bare model of (1),
we write

−−→A0∅,
BC

−−→B0∅,
CA
