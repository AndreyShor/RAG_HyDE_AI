Local structure of extremal points

Proof. The proof is almost identical to that of Lemma 4.8. Therefore, we only highlight the necessary
changes. First, for a fixed A > 0, we note that (4.10) in Lemma 4.8 also holds uniformly for
all u âˆˆ[âˆ’A, b1/4]. Then, the only thing that needs to be changed is the bound (4.20). Indeed,
Proposition A.5 can only be applied for u âˆˆ[bÎ¹, b3/4] for some Î¹ âˆˆ(0, 1/8). However, we can easily
overcome this issue by using monotonicity and replacing the endpoint u in the probability on the
left-hand side of (4.20) with u + bÎ¹ for some Î¹ âˆˆ(0, 1/8). This allows us to apply Proposition A.5,
from which we deduce that the probability on the left-hand side of (4.20) is bounded above by a
multiple of a2
k(u + bÎ¹)/(b âˆ’k). The conclusion then follows by proceeding with the remaining part
of the argument in the proof of Lemma 4.8 and recalling that u < b1/4.
The following lemma is analogous to [BL18, Lemma 4.21] in our setting.
Lemma 4.12. There exist constants c1, c2 > 0 such that for Î» > 0, for b âˆˆN large enough and
u âˆˆ[b1/4, b3/4],

Proof. We start with the upper bound in (4.21). Thanks to (4.13), it holds that

Thanks to Lemmas 4.8 and 4.10, the probability of the event on the right-hand side of the above
display is less than than a multiple of

eâˆ’c1(log k)2 + eâˆ’c2(log b)2 ,
for some constants c1, c2 > 0. Therefore, the desired bound follows. We observe that the upper bound
in (4.22) can be deduced in a similar way.
We now focus on the lower bounds. In particular, we limit ourself to study the lower bound in (4.21),
since the one in (4.22) can be obtained similarly. For k, b âˆˆN such that k < b, let Ek be the event
that all conditions in the definition of the control variable Kb are satisfied with Î˜k(Â·), except that we
do not impose any requirements on the oscillation bounds for the Brownian motion for time indices
up to and including time k. In particular, the event Ek is conditionally independent from Ïƒ((Bs)sâ‰¤k)
given Ïƒ(Bk). We have the following lower bound
P0,u,b(M0,b(Î¥b,g) â‰¤Î») â‰¥P0,u,b

where we used the fact that, thanks to Lemma 4.9, on the event Ek4, it holds that

\
j=k
{Bj â‰¥Î» + Rk(j)} âŠ†{M0,b,k(Î¥b,g) â‰¤Î»} .
4To be precise, the conclusion of Lemma 4.9 holds on the event {Kb â‰¤k}. However, as one can easily check, on the
annulus Bb \ Bk only the conditions on the oscillations of the Brownian motion after time k are relevant.
