By the Fenchel equivalence, this implies that (2.3) holds a.e. on [0,T]. Plugging this into CE
(2.2) shows that (2.1) holds. The opposite direction from (2.1) to L(ρ, j) = 0 with j from (2.1)
is obvious.
Of course, we will make these arguments rigorous for the reaction-diﬀusion systems under
consideration.
2.2
Convergence of gradient systems
Having introduced abstract gradient systems and brieﬂy discussed the energy-dissipation prin-
ciple, we now want to discuss, on an abstract level, our strategy for obtaining the convergence
of gradient ﬂows.
To this end, consider a family of approximating gradient systems (XN, YN, GN, EN, R∗
N)N∈N
inducing CEN, DN, and LN as before. As a ﬁrst step, one proves that each (XN, YN, GN, EN, R∗
N)
satisﬁes a chain rule inequality and an energy-dissipation principle.
Next, one shows that
for each N ∈N and each initial datum ρ0
N with EN(ρ0
N) < ∞there exists a solution pair
(˜ρN, ˜N) ∈CEN with ˜ρN(0) = ρ0
N and LN(˜ρN, ˜N) = 0.
Our aim is to connect the approximating gradient systems with a limit gradient system
(X, Y, G, E, R∗) inducing CE, D, and L. For this, one has to show that (X, Y, G, E, R∗) also
satisﬁes chain rule inequality and energy-dissipation principle.
To establish the link, a candidate curve that might be a solution for the limit system
needs to be obtained by applying a compactness argument to the family of prelimit solutions
(˜ρN, ˜N)N∈N. However, the diﬀerent gradient systems are deﬁned over diﬀerent base spaces,
hence a uniﬁed space is needed in which compactness can be realized. To this end, one constructs
an embedding operator ιN : M+(Xdom
N
, Xtar
N ) →M+(Xdom, Xtar) and a discretization operator
ι∗
N : C∞
c (Xdom, Xtar) →C∞
c (Xdom
N
, Xtar
N ) such that for all ϕ ∈C∞
c (Xdom, Xtar) it holds
⟨ιNρN, ϕ⟩X = ⟨ρN, ι∗
Nϕ⟩XN.
For the ﬂuxes one constructs ιN,G : M+(Y dom
N
, Y tar
N ) →M+(Y dom, Y tar) such that for all
ϕ ∈C∞
c (Xdom, Xtar) it holds
⟨ιN,GjN, Gϕ⟩Y = ⟨jN, GNι∗
Nϕ⟩YN.
Since the continuity equation is understood in the sense of distributions, this implies that
(ρN, jN) ∈CEN if and only if (ιNρN, ιN,GjN) ∈CE.
Now it is possible to prove that for each family (ρN, jN)N∈N with (ρN, jN) ∈CEN and
supN∈N supt∈[0,T] EN(ρN(t)) < ∞as well as supN∈N DN(ρN, jN) < ∞, there exists (ρ, j) ∈CE
with E(ρ(0)) < ∞and D(ρ, j) < ∞such that (along a subsequence) (ιNρN, ιN,GjN) ⇀∗(ρ, j).
In particular, such a limit (˜ρ, ˜) exists for the family (˜ρN, ˜N)N∈N.
Next, one shows that for each family (ρN, jN)N∈N satisfying the a priori bounds as before
and each limit (ρ, j) of the embedded family, we have the liminf estimates
lim inf
N→∞DN(ρN, jN) ≥D(ρ, j)
and
lim inf
N→∞EN(ρN(t)) ≥E(ρ(t))
∀t ∈[0, T].
(2.4)
Notice that this inequality relates the dissipation functionals of the non-embedded curves with
the limiting dissipation functional of the limiting curve.
In particular, (2.4) holds for the
previously obtained family of solutions (˜ρN, ˜N)N∈N and each of its limits (˜ρ, ˜).
