FIG. 9. Fifth (left panel) and sixth (right panel) order fluctuations of the entropy, i.e., χ5 and χ6, as functions of the temperature
with several values of baryon chemical potential.
Moreover, using the same method in [25], we employ the dependence of the Yukawa coupling on the RG scale k
calculated from the first-principles QCD [12], as an input for the LEFT. Then the Yukawa coupling in the LEFT now
reads
hk = h0
hQCD
k
hQCD
k=0
,
(31)
where hQCD
k
is computed by using the fRG approach to the first-principles QCD in the vacuum [12], as shown in
Figure 4. Here the parameter in the LEFT h0 = 12 is determined by fitting the constituent light u and d quark mass
ml = 311 MeV. Furthermore, we use the same values of parameters in the matter sector in (19) as those in [43].
In the left panel of Figure 5 we show the constituent masses for the u, d light quarks calculated in the 2+1 flavor
LEFT, depicted as functions of the temperature at several values of µB. Their respective derivatives with respect
to the temperature are shown in the right panel of Figure 5, from which one can determine the pseudo-critical
temperature for the chiral crossover through the location of the peak. Figure 6 displays the temperature dependence
of pressure calculated in our 2+1 flavor LEFT-fRG framework for baryon chemical potential µB ranging from µB = 0
to 550 MeV, from which one can compute the temperature derivatives of pressure. The relevant results, from the first
to sixth order derivatives, are presented in Figures 7 to 9, which stand for the entropy and its fluctuations of different
orders.
