with c the speed of light in vacuum and arad the radiation density constant.
The stability of the procedure is tested by recovering the opacity proﬁle from an evolutionary
model using the parametrized core proﬁle. We found that if the luminosity is well reproduced,
the opacity is recovered within less than 0.1%, which is suitable for comparisons with theoreti-
cal computations.
Attributing all corrections in temperature gradient at the BCZ to opacity modiﬁcations implies
that this region is purely radiative. This might not be entirely the case and changes could
be attributed to the opacity while in reality stemming from the thermalization of convective
elements. Monteiro et al. (1994)97 showed that some additional penetration at the BCZ could
improve the agreement with helioseismic data.
This introduces uncertainties in our inferred opacity values. However, based on recent re-
sults98;20, this transition should not extend below 0.68R⊙. Besides the temperature gradient
transition, it is central that mixing reproduces the current solar lithium and beryllium abun-
dances, along with lithium abundances observed in young solar twins in open clusters. In Zhang
et al. (2019)20, the chemical mixing reaches nearly 0.6R⊙for a temperature gradient transition
at 0.68R⊙. Therefore, if the observed temperature gradient transition in our inversions was only
due to overshooting, it would lead to much deeper mixing and excessive beryllium and lithium
depletion, especially during the pre-main sequence. While this does not entirely rule out over-
shooting, it suggests it should not be the sole explanation, leaving opacity as the only other
candidate.
Another point is the inﬂuence of radiative accelerations, extensively studied in solar mod-
els54;99;100. Their impact on solar structure is minimal, primarily near the BCZ. However, a
