Even if one accepts the reformulation of the Born rule proposed in this paper, many open
questions remain. For example: What is the physcial origin of the small-signal truncation that
we take as given and model in a relatively stylized way? Why does the truncation threshold
decay exponentially at exactly the rate needed to ensure that the exponent β equals one?
(Our explanation of this in Section 5 should be viewed as a proof of concept rather than
a complete account.) Are there other physical implications of the small-signal truncation
and the branching process described here, beyond explaining the Born rule? Hopefully, this
paper will encourage further discussion of these questions.
