FIG. 9: Example of boson sampling design with couplings for m = 10, n = 4 and universal interferometers on 3
modes. Each interferometer triangularizes a subblock of the matrix to synthesize W. The couplings permute the
modes. Once W is triangular it is actually diagonal and the synthesis is done. Two extra couplings at the
beginning and the end of the computation, not shown here, will be considered in our numerical analysis.
size m×n. We lack an analytical formula for dm,n,
so this is computed numerically. In the example
of Figure 9, dm,n = 6.
With extra in and out couplings, the total number of
couplings is
ncoupl = dm,n + 1.
The total MZI-depth is given by
dmzi = dm,n × k.
The total transmission η for one photon is given by
η = ηdmzi
mzi · ηncoupl
coupl
and ηn is the total transmission for n photons.
Number of modes.
In the usual formulation [1],
boson sampling is performed in the no-collision regime.
With enough modes the probability that every photon
ends up in a different mode can be made arbitrarily close
to 1, removing the need for number resolving detectors.
The necessary limit is m = O(n2) [1], but practical
results may be obtained with fewer modes [29].
We
study three cases:
• 48-photon 96-mode (m = 2n),
• 48-photon 288-mode (m = 6n),
• 48-photon 2304-mode (m = n2).

levels, boson sampling can be simulated efficiently
with a classical computer. Loss reduces the maximum
size of the matrices from which permanents have to
be calculated [30].
For a transmission per photon
η < 0.85, computing permanents of matrices no larger
than 48 is sufficient to simulate boson sampling. This
may still be tractable with supercomputers. Therefore,
to reach quantum utility, we require at least a total
transmission per photon of η = 0.85.
Numerics.
We compute the following:
• For fixed values of ηmzi and ηc, we compute the
chip size k that maximizes the per-photon trans-
mission.
• For a fixed value of ηmzi, we compute ηc such that
the per-photon transmission is η = 0.85, if such a
value exists.
These results are shown in the three graphs of Fig 10:
(a), (b), (c) correspond respectively to 96, 288 and
2304 modes.
The heatmap in the background gives the value of
the chip size that maximizes the transmission. With 96
modes, our scheme does not provide enough MZI-depth
reduction and using one big interferometer maximises
transmission. For 288 and 2304 modes there are cases
where our scheme provides improvements when the
coupling loss decreases but the MZI loss remains high.
With the current values of transmissions (97.6% for
