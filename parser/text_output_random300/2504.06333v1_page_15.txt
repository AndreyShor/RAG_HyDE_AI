Mathematical deﬁnition
Before proceeding with the deﬁnitions, we introduce some notation, as we will be
dealing with elements of tensor products of coalgebras frequently. Let H be a
coalgebra. An element a ∈H⊗n in the nth tensor product of H is written as a sum
a = ∑
j
a(1)
j
⊗a(2)
j
⊗⋯⊗a(n)
j
∈H⊗n
(4.10)
of elements a(1)
j ,a(2)
j ,⋯,a(n)
j
∈H, and j is an index that labels all elements in this
expansion.
We now deﬁne quasi-Hopf algebras. One ﬁrst deﬁnes a quasi-bialgebra, which
consists of a tuple (H,∆,ǫ,Φ), where H is an associative algebra, ∆∶H →H ⊗H
and ǫ ∶H →C are algebra maps, called the comultiplication, and counit, re-
spectively, and Φ ∈H ⊗H ⊗H is an invertible element in the tensor algebra,
called the coassociator.
The coassociator and its inverse are denoted as Φ =
∑j X(1)
j
⊗X(2)
j
⊗X(3)
j
and Φ−1 = ∑j x(1)
j
⊗x(2)
j
⊗x(3)
j
(with the sum over elements
assumed).
The tuple (H,∆,ǫ,Φ) satisﬁes the following identities:
1. counit
(IdH ⊗ǫ)(∆(h)) = (ǫ ⊗IdH)(∆(h)) = h,
(4.11)
2. quasi-coassociativity
(IdH ⊗∆)(∆(h)) = Φ(∆⊗IdH)(∆(h))Φ−1,
(4.12)
3. normalized 3-cocycle conditions
(IdH ⊗ǫ ⊗IdH)Φ = 1H ⊗1H,
(4.13)
(1H ⊗Φ)(IdH ⊗∆⊗IdH)(Φ)(Φ⊗1H) = (IdH ⊗IdH ⊗∆)(Φ)(∆⊗IdH ⊗IdH)(Φ).
(4.14)
A quasi-Hopf algebra is a quasi-bialgebra (H,∆,ǫ,Φ) endowed with an alge-
bra anti-homomorphism S ∶H →H (the antipode), and a pair of distinguished
elements α,β ∈H such that ǫ(α) = ǫ(β) = 1, satisfying for all h ∈H,
∑
j
S((∆(h))(1)
j )α (∆(h))(2)
j
= ǫ(h)α,
(4.15)
∑
j
(∆(h))(1)
j βS((∆(h))(2)
j ) = ǫ(h)β,
