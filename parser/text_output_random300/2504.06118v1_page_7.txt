FIG. 3. Reconstructed dark energy equation of state w(z) from multiple datasets. Panels (A1–A4) show DESI Data Release 1
(DR1) BAO results, both alone and in combination with three independent Type Ia supernova (SNe) datasets, under two
different approaches: the correlation-prior method (bottom-layered, dark-blue band) and the (w0, wa) parameterization (top-
layered, green band). The solid and dashed white lines indicate the best-fit reconstructions of w(z), and the shaded regions are
68% confidence-level uncertainties. The horizontal dashed line denotes the ΛCDM prediction (w = −1). Panels (B1–B4) mirror
these setups for the DESI Data Release 2 (DR2) BAO sample. In all panels, the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) prior and
constraints on the CMB acoustic scale θ∗are imposed.
FIG. 4.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the dark energy equation of state w(z). The left panels (A1–A4) plot the
first three principal components ei(z) as functions of redshift, showcasing how different dataset combinations constrain distinct
modes in w(z). The right panels (B1–B4) display the corresponding eigenvalues λi versus the mode index, revealing the relative
information that each dataset provides compared with the correlation-prior baseline (green curves). Solid lines distinguish DESI
Data Release 1 (DR1) BAO analyses, and dashed lines indicate DESI Data Release 2 (DR2), and the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
(BBN) prior and constraints on the CMB acoustic scale θ∗are imposed in all cases. Larger eigenvalues signify better-constrained
modes.
