different combinations of representations that solve the linear system of equations in (3.12)
and (3.13). To explore this, we apply the algorithm described previously.
Being a real, semisimple algebra, all odd powers of the Chern character vanish. Further-
more, for exceptional algebras such as G2 there is no modified fourth-order index [38], which
means that a fourth-order Casimir is proportional to powers of a lower-order Casimir. Thus,
the general system (3.12) simplifies significantly. We need the sixth-order indices of these
representations found in [40] to proceed. These are related to the constants u(1)
r
showing up
in the trace identity trr F 6 = u(1)
r tr F 6 + u(8)
r (tr F 2)3 (up to an irrelevant normalization of
1/6!) needed to re-express the sixth-order piece of the Chern character in an arbitrary rep-
resentation in terms of the Chern character of the fundamental representation of G2, which
we choose as our reference representation (see the discussion of Section 3). The second-order
indices needed to determine the other constants appearing in (3.8), have also been computed
in many places (see e.g. [41]). We note in passing that these specific trace identities are only
valid for [38] A1, A2 and exceptional algebras. Taking all of this into account, we find that
only five non-trival anomaly cancellation constraints remain.
Following these steps, we have identified all possible solutions to this system where the
degeneracies are positive, i.e. every particle has positive chirality. There are only four possibil-
ities, shown in table 1 which depicts the spectrum and the corresponding factorized anomaly
polynomial. It turns out that all of these solutions arise from restriction of a single E8 adjoint
to different branches of G2 subgroups; as a result, they do not constitute qualitatively new
boundary conditions for M-theory, but rather correspond merely to taking the Hoˇrava-Witten
M9 and looking at anomalies in a G2 subgroup of E8. The first spectrum comes from the
branching [41]
E8 ⊃G2 × F4,
248 →(14, 1) ⊕(7, 26) ⊕(1, 52).
(3.14)
The second solution can be similarly found by the chain of embeddings
E8 ⊃E7 ⊗SU(2),
E7 ⊃SU(2) × G2,
(3.15)
and the third corresponds to
E8 ⊃E6 ⊗SU(3),
E6 ⊃G2.
(3.16)
Finally, the fourth comes from the chain
E8 ⊃SO(14) ⊃G2.
(3.17)
It is worth mentioning that we have also found some curious solutions that have an
appealing anomaly polynomial factorization, which is almost as the restricted Green-Schwarz
factorization obeyed by the original E8 gauge theory of Hoˇrava-Witten or those found for G2
