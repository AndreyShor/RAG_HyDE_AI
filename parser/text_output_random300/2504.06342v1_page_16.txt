Figure 6. Temporal evolution of AGN luminosity 𝐿BH (normalized by Eddington luminosity 𝐿Edd, top) and specific
star formation rate sSFR (bottom) in the fiducial (blue), noSNfb (orange), and noAGNfb (green) simulations. The
dashed line in the top panel indicates 𝐿bh/𝐿Edd = 2%, delineating the transition between cold (above) and hot (below)
AGN feedback modes. Each model exhibits distinctive evolutionary patterns: fiducial shows correlated AGN-
sSFR bursts at ∼102 Myr intervals, noSNfb displays rapid fluctuations on ∼Myr timescales, and noAGNfb maintains
persistently elevated AGN activity.
throughout the simulation period. While the sSFR
remains predominantly below 10−12 yr−1, suggest-
ing apparent quiescence, this result requires care-
ful interpretation. The simulation setup includes a
central SMBH that functions as a gas sink through
accretion but provides no energetic feedback. This
artificial configuration may substantially underes-
timate the true star formation potential, as gas that
would otherwise participate in star formation is
continuously depleted by the SMBH. In a more re-
alistic scenario lacking a central SMBH, gas accu-
mulation in central regions could potentially drive
significant star formation activity, potentially tran-
sitioning the galaxy into an actively star-forming
state.
3.5. Duty cycle of AGN activity
The distinct temporal evolution patterns of AGN
luminosity and specific star formation rate across
our three simulations manifest in remarkably dif-
ferent AGN duty cycles, as summarized in Ta-

Table 2. Comparison of the AGN duty cycles across
simulation models, where the duty cycle is the fraction
of time spent in active phases, and the averaged single-
cycle timescale is the total duration of an active phase
and the following inactive phase. Here, the criterion
for an active phase is 𝐿bh > 1%𝐿Edd. The fiducial
model demonstrates characteristics of both duty cycle
and single-cycle timescale consistent with observational
constraints, while noSNfb and noAGNfb models exhibit
significantly shorter and longer duty cycles and single-
cycle timescale, respectively.

time the AGN spends in active phases (defined by
