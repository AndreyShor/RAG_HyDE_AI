provide quantitative evidence that dΓ¯us/dω2 is in fact
negligible w.r.t the errors that we have on the dominant
dΓ¯cs/dω2 contribution.
Before closing this section we show in Figure 31 the com-
parison of the dominating contribution dΓ¯cs/dω2 to the
inclusive differential decay rate with the exclusive contri-
bution in the same flavor channel, i.e. with dΓexcl
¯cs /dω2.
The exclusive results, that we show separately for the dif-
ferent ensembles, have been obtained by using the same
analysis procedure that we used to compute dΓexcl
¯us /dω2,
i.e. by extracting the form-factor f +
¯cs(ω2) from the ampu-
tated correlator ˆY+
¯cs(t, ω2). As expected (see section II),
the inclusive and exclusive contributions are fully com-
patible within errors at the end-point of the phase-space,
i.e. at ω = ωmax
¯cs
.
This is a reassuring evidence con-
cerning the robustness of the procedure that we used to
estimate the systematic errors. Particularly important
in this case is the systematic uncertainty associated with
the σ 7→0 extrapolations that become steeper when ω
gets closer to ωmax
¯cs
(see Figures 15 and 16). In the bulk
of the phase space, i.e. for |ω| < ωmax
¯cs
, the inclusive
decay rate is substantially larger than the exclusive con-
tribution.
This is a strong evidence that the method
that we have used in our lattice calculation allows to
study from first-principles truly-inclusive processes, i.e.
processes that cannot be approximated by considering a
single exclusive channel, at a level of accuracy which is
relevant for phenomenology.

Error budgets of the differential first lepton-energy
moment for the channels ¯cs (top-panel) and ¯cd (bottom-

The red points correspond to the total error ∆tot,
the blue points to the statistical error ∆stat, the green points
to the finite size systematic error ∆L, the purple points to
the continuum extrapolation systematic error ∆a, the yellow
points to the σ 7→0 extrapolation systematic error ∆σ and
the black points to the HLT systematic error ∆HLT. ∆a and
∆σ are given by the second term in Eq. (99).
