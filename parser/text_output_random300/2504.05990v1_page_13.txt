Table 3: Description of patients by the resulting phenogroups from unsupervised clustering 
on the radiomic features, reported for the SDOH demographic correlate of sex. The median 
parenchymal score for all patients within each phenogroup is the same as in Table 2 but 
repeated here for reference.

3.2 Imaging-derived health disparities indices (iHDI) 
The calculation of the iHDIs for each demographic correlate and each image-based phenogroup 
demonstrate the potential for imaging-based values to be aggregated into standard health 
disparities indices (Table 4).

For the iHDI of BGV, BGV tended to be higher for the SDOH demographic correlate of race in 
both phenogroups than for sex. This suggests the demographic groups of race have larger 
differences between them in terms of the radiomic phenotype than do the demographic groups of 
sex. Conversely, IDisp for the SDOH demographic correlate of sex (measuring difference from the 
Male group in this study) was negative and large, suggesting that the radiomic phenotype for
