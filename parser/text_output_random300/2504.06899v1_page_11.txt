is needed in more than one ϵh). Furthermore, we use low-
level bit operation on substrings rather than calculating
each substring frequency separately to improve efficiency
even more.
The last part is responsible for calculating the final
value of ϵ.
We implemented two families of weighted
averages described in Section IV E. Namely, exponential
average (see Eq. (24)) and polynomial average (see Eq.
(26)). Here, the calculation is performed in a separate
function, so it is easy to modify it or create a new one.
Therefore, any function that is coherent with the form
described in Section IV C can be used, although we rec-
ommend one that fulfills at least part of the axioms de-
scribed in Section IV D.

RESULTS
Let us now discuss the efficiency of the seismic appara-
tus in generating partially random bits. This is an impor-
tant problem since the previous approach via heartbeat
suffered from low rates for natural reasons. The size of
raw data downloaded from a particular apparatus may
heavily depend on its location. We thus focus on the av-
erage size of filtered data from a package of raw data of
fixed size.
Our detailed analysis first focuses on the noise, and
the results are organized as follows. The tables I–V show
values of ˜ϵh approximated as in equation 15 for every dis-
cretization (see Appendix B). Each of the tables refers to
different numbers of preprocessed data: 1 Mb, 10 Mb,
100 Mb, 1 Gb, 1.5 Gb, respectively. The symbol of three
vertical dots means that for these values ˜ϵh = 1
2, so in the
tables h ranges from 0 to the minimal value of h for which
˜ϵh = 1
2. In the last row, there are values of ϵ defined in
equation 23. To make the analysis of data easier the val-
ues from the last row are plotted both as a function of
number of preprocessed bits (figures 1, 2) and discretiza-
tion types (figures 3, 4). Additionally, in the table VI
there are values of ˜ϵh and ϵ for every number of prepro-
cessed bits for discretization 5 and the table VII gathers
all values of ϵ from the tables I–V for clear comparison.
The last table VIII shows results for data obtained from
deep and strong earthquakes that we refer to as events
to distinguish them from the noise ones described above.
The first study of values from tables I–V reveals a sig-
nificant difference in values of ˜ϵh for the discretization
3. Comparing to the other discretizations, their values
are greater, although the value of ˜ϵh gains 1
2 for longer
history length h. This concludes that applying the third
discretization makes randomness weaker. As one see in
Appendix B, bits are assigned according to the relation
of the absolute value of the real numbers to the average
value of the absolute values of the sequence. However, in
such a way, some part of the information is lost, which
causes the observed effect.
The next observation is that values of ˜ϵh for the first
and the second discretization are very close to each other.

Results are obtained from 1 Mb of preprocessed data, i.e.,
1 Mb bits that are the output of discretization. The types
of discretization 1–5 as defined in Section IV F are given in
corresponding columns.
Notice that in the first discretization, the reference point
of the values of the binary sequence is 0, and in the sec-
ond discretization, it is the mean value of the sequence
of real numbers from the input file (see Appendix B).
The method used to preprocess the seismic data (based
on Fourier’s transformation) causes this real numbers se-
quence to oscillate around 0. Hence the mean value is
near 0, which makes, in consequence, both discretizations
outputs practically the same.
The last but not least remark is that ϵ for all discretiza-
tion except the third one, as mentioned before, converges
to the same value close to 0.25. This fact leads to the
conclusion that ground motion, which has both artificial
(noise) and natural (earthquakes) origins, is a Santha-
Vazirani source with ϵ ≈0.25.
We observe similar properties in the events case (deep
and strong earthquakes) presented in Table VIII.

DISCUSSION
In this article, we have contributed to the field of weak
randomness analysis in three ways.
We have first de-
veloped the mathematical framework for estimation of
quality weakly random sources. We have focused on ver-
ifying if a given source can be treated as the so called
