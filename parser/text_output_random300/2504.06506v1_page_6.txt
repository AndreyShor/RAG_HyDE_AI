In this context we recall the standard convention,
dom(T2T1) = {g ∈dom(T1) | T1g ∈dom(T2)}.
(2.15)
Since operators with closed range will play a particular role in the following, we
mention the following criterion:
Lemma 2.2. ([7, Lemma A.1], [11, Lemma 2.44].)
Suppose T : dom(T ) →H2, dom(T ) ⊆H1, is densely deﬁned and closed. Then the
following items (i)–(iii) are equivalent:
(i)
ran(T ) is closed in H2.
(ii)
0 /∈σ(T ∗T ), or, 0 is an isolated point in σ(T ∗T ).
(iii) There exists cT ∈(0, ∞) such that
∥T f∥H ⩾cT ∥f∥H,
f ∈dom(T ) ∩[ker(T )]⊥.
In particular, ran(T ) is closed if 0 ∈bρ(T ).
This can be contrasted with (2.1) for z = 0.
Next, we recall the notion of Fredholm and left semi-Fredholm operators and
their index:
Deﬁnition 2.3. Suppose T : dom(T ) →H2, dom(T ) ⊆H1, is densely deﬁned and
closed and ran(T ) is closed in H2.
(i) Then T is Fredholm if
dim(ker(T )) + dim(ker(T ∗)) < ∞.
(2.16)
(ii) Similarly, T is a left semi-Fredholm operator if
dim(ker(T )) < ∞.
(2.17)
(iii) Finally, T is a right semi-Fredholm operator if
dim(ker(T ∗)) < ∞.
(2.18)
In all cases, the (semi-)Fredholm index, ind(T ), of T is deﬁned via
ind(T ) = dim(ker(T )) −dim(ker(T ∗)) ∈Z ∪{−∞, +∞}.
(2.19)
(Of course, ind(T ) ∈Z if T is Fredholm.)
One notes that under the hypothesis in Deﬁnition 2.3,
T is a (left semi-) Fredholm operator
if and only if
T ∗is a (right semi-) Fredholm operator.
(2.20)
In addition, since
ker(T ) = ker(T ∗T ),
ker(T ∗) = ker(T T ∗),
(2.21)
one gets
ind(T ) = dim(ker(T ∗T )) −dim(ker(T T ∗)) ∈Z ∪{−∞, +∞},
(2.22)
which represents a reduction to the case of self-adjoint and nonnegative operators
T ∗T ⩾0, and T T ∗⩾0, in H1, and H2, respectively. Moreover, we recall that
ind(T ∗) = −ind(T ).
