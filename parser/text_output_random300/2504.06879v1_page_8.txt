best fit the given data while generalizing effectively to unseen data, thereby improving prediction accuracy and
overall model performance.
Optimization algorithms [30] enable models to learn from data, adapt to complex patterns, and produce accurate
predictions by adjusting model parameters. The choice of an optimization method significantly affects the efficiency
and convergence of a machine learning model, making it a crucial decision during the model development process.
To construct the inverse potential directly from the available experimental data, we optimize the parameters of
the reference potential using a meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by natural selection and evolution. The machine-
learning-based genetic algorithm iteratively refines parameter sets to minimize the error between predicted and
experimental values by reducing the cost function[31]. It begins with a population of feasible solutions and evolves
to new solution sets at each iteration, aiming to improve fitness and achieve optimal performance.
Steps:
• Initialisation: Arrays of projectile energies Elab in the laboratory frame and the corresponding scattering
phase shifts δ(E) are given as input for analysis. The variation of scattering phase shifts δ(E) as a function
of energy E provides insight into emergent resonances through the analysis of the slope’s behavior. Ranges
are defined for the model parameters of the reference potential to narrow the optimization space and focus on
a specific region. To improve convergence, previously obtained parameter sets can be included in the initial
population, using past solutions to make the search for the global optimum more efficient.
• Genetic Algorithm[32]: The Process starts with the creation of a random population of parameters that
represent possible solutions of the optimization routine.
Each generation involves selecting of candidate
solution based on their fitness. Their fitness is determined based on the cost function, i.e. Mean Absolute
Percentage Error. MAPE between the simulated and experimental SPS is computed as

The solution with lower MAPE values are selected for reproduction, where genetic operators such as crossover
and mutation create new offspring. This process of selection, cross-over, and mutation continues over mul-
tiple generations, refining the model parameters to minimize the cost function and improve the fit to the
experimental data.
• Potential Determination: The reference potentials for each parameter produced by the parent class are calcu-
lated. Following this, the parameter ranges are adjusted to ensure that the resulting inverse potential aligns
with physical constraints and meets the specified conditions. Within this framework, our machine-learning-
based heuristic algorithm employs the phase equation that governs the scattering process to optimize and
adjust the potential parameters.
• Numerical Solution of Phase Equation: To compute the simulated scattering phase shifts (SPS), denoted as
δl one solves the phase equation numerically using the fifth-order Runge-Kutta (RK-5) method. This solution
