a,b are the HGH fitting parameters that depend on the ion type found by
matching various quantities in the valence region with an all-electron or DFT calculation.3 Eq. (7) expresses
V i,I
PP,NL as a sum of projectors on states with low angular momentum – typically, lmax ≤2.
We see from Eq. (4) that the 1-body pseudopotentials are “lifted” to bona-fide 2-body electron-pseudoion
interactions which are diagonal in the pseudoion position (hence the traditional 1-body pseudopotential
term is no longer present). In contrast to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, this treatment includes the
quantum mechanical motion of all chemically relevant degrees of freedom, i.e. the dynamics of both pseu-
doions and electrons, and their mutual interactions. Besides the interactions with electrons, the pseudoions
themselves evolve via their own kinetic terms Tion and the pseudoion-pseudoion interactions V PI
ion as seen in
Eq. (3). The simple form of V PI
ion stems from the intuition that in non-relativistic chemical and material sys-
tems, pseudoions are sufficiently spatially separated such that, to leading order in the multipole expansion,
they can be treated as effective point charges interacting via Coulomb repulsion, with ZI replaced by ZPI
I
defined in Eq. (2). More sophisticated models could be introduced in the future.
