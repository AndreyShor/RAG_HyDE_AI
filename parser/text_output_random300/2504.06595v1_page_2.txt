proach to identify promising electrolyte candidates. Its
primary utility comes from allowing dynamical simula-
tions at longer timescales, and over a greater temperature
range, leading to improved statistics and direct predic-
tion of temperature scaling.
This paper is organized as follows: we give a micro-
scopic description of ionic motion through a solid elec-
trolyte in Sec. II. There, we show that the displacement
of the electrolyte’s atoms in response to the mobile ions
is given by a transcendental time-local Eq. (16). Next,
we introduce a model system in Sec. III and validate our
time-local treatment in Sec. IV, where we show that ad-
ditional simplifications remove the transcendental nature
of Eq. (16). We demonstrate our formalism’s power to
capture dissipation and diffusion in Secs. V and VI, re-
spectively. In section VII, we discuss of the results, as-
sumptions, limitations, and consequences of our study,
and conclude with a summary in Sec. VIII.
II.
MODEL
As in our earlier work, [22–26] we start with a La-
grangian describing the motion of a particle of mass M
through a crystalline framework:
L = M

Here, R is the mobile particle’s position, r is a vector
of framework atom displacements from their equilibria,
and ↔
m is the framework’s mass matrix.
rT ↔
V r/2 gives
the framework’s potential energy in the harmonic ap-
proximation and U(r, R) is the interaction between the
framework and particle.
Equation (1) yields the standard equations of motion
M ¨R = −∇RU (r, R) ,

m¨r = −

V r −∇rU (r, R) .

Although Eqs. (2) and (3) contain all the information
necessary to solve the problem, they are unmanageable
for large systems.
Fortunately, it is possible to write
down a formal solution for r which can then be used to
solve Eq. (2). We start by writing Eq. (3) as a symmetric
eigenvalue problem

where 0+ is an infinitesimal dissipation.
Without the
final term, r describes a homogeneous solution for the
framework which corresponds to thermal vibration. We
will address this motion component below and focus on
the framework’s response to its interaction with the par-
ticle first. Taking the Fourier transform of Eq. (4) with
respect to time and solving for rω gives

Having obtained the particular solution determined by

The third term on the right-hand side goes to zero at
large t because it is a sum of oscillating cosine func-
tions. Therefore, we will drop it in the subsequent anal-
ysis.
If the time derivative of the force vanishes, we
can introduce δ ≡r −rH so that Eq. (11) becomes
