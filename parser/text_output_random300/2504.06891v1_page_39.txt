Supplementary Figure 12: Opacity proﬁles for secondary contributors at the base of the solar
convective zone on the seismic thermodynamical path for both the OP and OPAS codes. Left

than both OPAS and OPLIB. While these differences remain limited, they still have an impact
on the chemical composition of a calibrated model, as seen in Table 1 for Model 1 and Model
3 showing differences of 0.003 in helium mass fraction, which is signiﬁcant at the level of
precision of helioseismic constraints (as 1 σ = 0.00359).
SCO-RCG computations
SCO-RCG58;59 is an opacity code combining ﬁne-structure calculations with statistical mod-
elling of radiative transitions in local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (LTE) plasmas. The code
combines the data required for computing detailed transition arrays in the superconﬁguration
formalism (SCO: Superconﬁguration Code for Opacity) within a plasma model accounting for
the density and screening effects on the wavefunctions. The level energies and the line energies
and strengths are computed by the module RCG (Robert Cowan’s “G” subroutine), which is
