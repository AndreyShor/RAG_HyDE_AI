of Ref. [21]. Due to the limited size of the data sample it is not possible to determine
the full three-dimensional angular distribution, neither is it feasible to apply initial-state
flavour-tagging to distinguish B0
s from B0
s decays. A subset of the angular observables,
FL, A6, S3 and A9 are determined by analysing reduced angular distributions of the
decay, separately in the θe and θK angles and in Φ. The observable FL is the longitudinal
polarisation fraction of the ϕ meson. The asymmetry A6 is even under time-reversal
and generates a forward-backward asymmetry in the dilepton system. Conversely, the
asymmetry A9 is odd under time-reversal [22]. The observable S3 is proportional to the
difference between the magnitude squared of the CP-odd and CP-even amplitudes that
contribute to the transverse polarisation of the ϕ meson. The observables S3 and A9 are
associated with cos 2Φ and sin 2Φ variations of the Φ distribution, respectively.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: the parametrisation used to
describe the angular distribution of the B0
s →ϕe+e−decay is introduced in Sec. 2; Sec. 3
contains a description of the LHCb detector and the production of simulated samples used
in the analysis; in Sec. 4 the selection of B0
s candidates is discussed; corrections for the
nonuniform efficiency of the event reconstruction and candidate selection are described
in Sec. 5; the determination of the observables from the candidates K+K−e+e−mass,
m(K+K−e+e−), and angular distributions is described in Sec. 6; Sec. 7 is focussed on the
validation of the analysis using pseudoexperiments and B0
s →J/ψϕ decays in data; sources
of systematic uncertainty are discussed in Sec. 8; and results are presented in Sec. 9.
