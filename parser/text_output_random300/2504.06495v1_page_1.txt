Uniﬁed Quantum Dynamics:
The Emergence of the Born Rule
Martin Weidner∗
April 2025
Abstract
While the Born rule is traditionally introduced as a separate postulate of quantum
mechanics, we show it emerges naturally from a modiﬁed Schr¨odinger equation that
includes “small-signal truncation”. This parallels the way quantum decoherence gives
rise to the branches of the multiverse in the “Many-Worlds Interpretation”, eliminating
the need for a separate measurement postulate. Our approach thus oﬀers a uniﬁed
framework in which both the emergence of multiple branches of the multiverse and
their statistical properties follow from a single fundamental law of motion. We model
“small-signal truncation” in a somewhat stylized manner, but we argue that the precise
details of its underlying physical mechanism do not aﬀect the emergence of the Born
rule.
