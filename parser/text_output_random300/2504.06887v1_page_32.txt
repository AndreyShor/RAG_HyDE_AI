Here, we have used the contour in the lower half plane and summed all residues to write the second line. Summing the
infinite series one obtains
˙F =

(e4πκRsΩ−1).

Using expansion of log(x + 1) about x=1 we get the following series for the transition rate,

Repeating the above calculation with the 2-bein (25) one gets similar expression in Eq.(106), without cosh factor in the
nominator. Therefore, we get the transition rate

Appendix D
Computing transition probability
In this appendix, we apply the saddle point approximation to compute the diagonal terms of ρAB, known as the transition
probability [89; 101]. The transition probability is given by the following type of integration

Now we use the fact that in the case of static detector W α
ψ (x(τ), x(τ ′)) is a function of τ −τ ′ viz, it depends only on the
interval of time. Changing variables from τ, τ ′ to ˜x = τ + τ ′ and ˜y = τ −τ ′ one gets

Shifting the contour in an imaginary direction for ˜y by 2Ωσ2 makes the exponential factors real. Now, the saddle point
approximation on the resulting expression gives [89; 101]
L ≈2πσ2λ2e−σ2Ω2W α
ψ (x(τ0 −iΩσ2), x(τ0 + iΩσ2)) + residue terms.
(111)
The residue term that comes from shifting the contour vanishes if one restricts to Ωσ2/2κRs < π, as no pole is being
crossed.
