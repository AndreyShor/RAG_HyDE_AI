This strongly suggests that the process (eΨs)s≥0 is “stationary modulo tilt” in the sense that, for any
non-decreasing sequence of non-negative times (s0, . . . , sn) ⊆R+
0 , any t ≥0, and any function
F ∈Cb((C(Rd))n), one has
E[e

Now, consider the process (ρt)t≥0 given by
ρt
def=
X
j∈N
δxj ⊗δwj+Zj,t ⊗δeΨj,t ,
∀t ≥0 ,
(2.20)
where (Zj, eΨj)j∈N is a collection of i.i.d. copies of (Z, eΨ), and (xj, wj)j∈N is an arbitrary enumeration
of the Poisson point process with intensity a⋆γµγc(dx) ⊗exp(−
√
2dw)dw, where a⋆is the constant
introduced in (2.11). Then, similarly to [RA05, Proposition 3.1], one can show that (2.19) implies
that the process (ρt)t≥0 is stationary.
Remark 2.19 (Full process convergence). For 0 ≪b ≪t, recalling (2.1), we define the measure ρt,b
on [0, 1]d × R × C(Rd) as follows
ρt,b
def=
X
x∈Rd : Xt(x)=sup|y−x|≤eb−t Xt(y)
δx ⊗δXt(x)−mt ⊗δXt(x+e−t·)−Xt(x) ,
which roughly speaking keeps track of the locations of the maxima, their heights, and the shape of the
field around them. Then, combining the results of the present article with the techniques of [BL18], it
should not be too hard to show, analogously to [BL18, Theorem 2.1], the convergence in law
lim
b→∞lim
t→∞ρt,b = PPP(a⋆γµγc(dx) ⊗e−
√
2dwdw ⊗ν(dϕ)) ,
where ν denotes the law of the field Ψ on C(Rd), and a⋆is the constant introduced in (2.11).
Furthermore, the discussion in the preceding paragraph strongly suggests that
lim
b→∞lim
t→∞ρt+·,b = ρ· ,
where ρ is the process introduced in (2.20).

Outline
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 3, we gather some background material
that will be used throughout the paper. Section 4 focuses on the local structure of extremal points, and
contains the proofs of Theorems A and B. In Section 5, we establish key properties of the shape field,
including a suitable resampling property, and prove Propositions 2.11 and 2.13. Section 6 is dedicated
to the proof of Theorem C, which is based on Proposition 2.17. The proof of this proposition, in turn,
relies on a key technical result, Proposition 6.1, whose proof is given in Section 7. We conclude the
paper with three appendices. In Appendix A, we establish several estimates concerning the probability
of a Brownian bridge remaining above a slowly growing positive or negative curve. Appendix B
contains the proof of a technical lemma used in Section 7. Finally, in Appendix C, we collect some
standard results on Gaussian fields.

Background and preliminaries
In this section, we collect some preliminary results needed for the proof of our main theorems. In
particular, in Section 3.1, we collect some basic and recurrent notation that will be used throughout
the paper. In Section 3.2, we recall some standard results related to convergence in distribution of
random measures, and in particular we briefly introduce the concept of stable convergence. Finally, in
Section 3.3, we record some properties of ⋆-scale invariant fields and their martingale approximations.
