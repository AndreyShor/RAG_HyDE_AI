for enhancing system responsiveness in practice. Notably, our
model outperforms the leader of the BATADAL challenge
without relying on specific domain knowledge, making it a
more generalizable solution. Furthermore, our method main-
tains the same time complexity as conventional autoencoders
while reducing the number of fully connected layers from
three to two compared to the benchmark. This simplification
not only streamlines the architecture but also contributes to a
greener, more sustainable model with lower computational
requirements.
Our algorithm is highly flexible and can be integrated
into any autoencoder for anomaly detection in systems where
physical data or deterministic processes are expected. We aim
to move beyond conventional statistical fitting of non-linear
functions, contributing to the broader challenge of guiding
neural networks to learn generalizable and interpretable
abstractions that embed meaningful, process-driven relation-
ships.
Future work will focus on studying the theoretical foun-
dations of this method and testing it on simpler systems with
known analytical solutions. This will allow us to validate the
relationships between static and dynamic features in the latent
space and explore whether consistent laws emerge between
deterministic nodes. Such investigations could provide deeper
insights into the system’s dynamics and further study the
interpretability of the TDC-informed models.
