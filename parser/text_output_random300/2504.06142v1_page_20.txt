arbitrary algebra, ε(X) = εa(X)Ta and ϕ(X) = ϕa(X)Ta, where Ta are the generators of the
algebra. Their commutation relation will be:

In the ordinary, commutative case, the last term vanishes as the components εa and ϕb are
ordinary functions of coordinates which commute with each other. On the contrary, when
the space is noncommutative, the last term is not vanishing and, thus, the anticommutator
of the generators remains in the expression. In the general case, an anticommutator like that
will yield items that don’t belong in the original algebra of the theory, meaning that the
corresponding algebra does not close. In order to remedy that, we have to pick a specific
representation of the algebra generators, and subsequently extend the initial gauge group to
one with larger symmetry, in which both the commutator and anticommutator algebras close.
Following this procedure, we are led to the extension of our initial gauge group SO(1, 4) to
SO(2, 4) × U(1).

Fuzzy Gravity
Since we have already determined the appropriate gauge group of the theory, we are now
able to move on with the gauging procedure on the fuzzy space that was presented above.
Following the steps described in [39], we firstly have to introduce the covariant coordinate of
the theory, which is defined as:
Xµ = Xµ ⊗14 + Aµ(X) ,
(106)
where Aµ is the gauge connection of the theory. The gauge connection can, in turn, be
expanded on the gauge group generators as:
Aµ = aµ ⊗14 + ωµ
ab ⊗Mab + eµ
a ⊗Pa + fµ
a ⊗Ka + ˜aµ ⊗D .
(107)
Given the above expansion (107), the explicit form of the covariant coordinate (106) can be
written down as:
Xµ = (Xµ + aµ) ⊗14 + ωµ
ab ⊗Mab + eµ
a ⊗Pa + fµ
a ⊗Ka + ˜aµ ⊗D .
(108)
At this point, what remains to be determined is the appropriate covariant field strength
tensor for the theory. In the case of noncommutativity, the latter is defined as [39, 80]:
ˆFµν ≡[Xµ, Xν] −κ2 ˆΘµν ,
(109)
where ˆΘµν ≡Θµν + Bµν, in which Bµν is a 2-form field taking care of the transformation of
Θ, promoting it to its covariant form. Since ˆFµν is an element of the gauge algebra it can
also be expanded on the algebra’s generators as
ˆFµν = Rµν ⊗14 + 1
2Rµν
ab ⊗Mab + ˜Rµν
a ⊗Pa + Rµν
a ⊗Ka + ˜Rµν ⊗D .
