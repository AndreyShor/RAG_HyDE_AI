Step 2: In this second step, we show that, for any ε > 0, there exist R ≥1 large enough such that for
all s > 0 large enough satisfying (es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N, and t ≥s large enough, it holds that

Since the lower bound can be obtained in a similar manner to the upper bound, we just focus on the
latter. We recall that if x, y ∈[0, 1]d belong to two different squares in the decomposition described
in Figure 2, then |x −y| ≥e−s and so Xs,t(x) and Xs,t(y) are independent. Moreover, if x, y are
as above, then thanks to (W3), we also have that (Wi,t(x))i∈[n] and (Wi,t(y))i∈[n] are independent.
Hence, using this fact, making the change of variables x 7→esx, and preceding in the same manner in
the first step, we obtain that

Now, since for each i ∈[I], the function χ(e−s·) on esAi satisfies all the conditions stated in (6.6),
by Proposition 6.1, we get that for all s > 0 large enough satisfying (es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N, and
t ≥s large enough, it holds that

For all i ∈[I], using the assumptions on the function χ, we obtain that for sufficiently large s ≥0,
the following holds

Therefore, using the inequality Q
i∈[I](1−ai) ≤exp(−P
i∈[I] ai), which is valid for (ai)i∈[I] ⊂[0, 1],
and making the change of variables x 7→esx, we get that

where, once again, the last inequality is due to the fact that, since by assumption χ is scaled-admissible
in the sense of Definition 6.2, the quantity edsρχ(BR,s) can be made arbitrarily small by taking s ≥0
and R ≥1 large enough.
Step 3: In this final step, we show how to combine the previous two steps to obtain the desired result.
Thanks to decomposition (6.3) and to the elementary inequality ab ≥a + b −1 valid for a, b ∈[0, 1],
we have that
