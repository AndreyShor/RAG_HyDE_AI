ited amount of information. At near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths,
SNe Ia are well-known for being pseudo-standard candles (NIR;
e.g. Elias et al. 1981, 1985; Meikle 2000; Krisciunas et al. 2004a;
Avelino et al. 2019). Their high degree of intrinsic homogeneity
at these wavelengths even allows us to estimate their peak bright-
ness with a single photometric epoch, with the caveat of having
well-sampled optical light curves (Stanishev et al. 2018; Müller-
Bravo et al. 2022a). However, this low dispersion only applies to
their first peak. SNe Ia develop a distinct secondary NIR peak a
few weeks after the first one, but the characteristics of it largely
vary from object to object. Therefore, the study of SNe Ia at NIR
wavelengths gives provides further insights into their progeni-
tors and explosion mechanisms (e.g. Wheeler et al. 1998; Kasen
2006).
Some initial theoretical modeling of SNe Ia at NIR wave-
lengths, such as those from Hoeflich et al. (1995) and Pinto &
Eastman (2000), hinted towards a drop in opacity, that is a de-
crease of the diffusion time, explaining the secondary peak. This
would also avoid the need of an additional power source inject-
ing energy at later epochs. Pinto & Eastman (2000) also noted an
increase in the abundance of Fe ii coinciding with the increase in
emissivity in the NIR. Kasen (2006, hereafter K06), also through
theoretical modeling, came to the conclusion that the secondary
peak is produced by the recombination of iron-group elements
inside the ejecta of the SN, going from double to single ionized
(e.g., Fe iii →Fe ii). The prominence and time of the peak was
found to depend on several physical parameters, such as MNi, the
metallicity of the progenitor and the amount of mixing of 56Ni. In
addition, Hoeflich et al. (2017) argue that the NIR flux reaches a
secondary maximum when the radius of the photosphere reaches
its maximum, assuming that the NIR flux follows Wein’s limit1.
Purely from observations, Phillips (2012) showed that
brighter SNe Ia tend to have brighter and delayed secondary
peaks, while fainter ones have fainter and earlier secondary
peaks, even turning into a shoulder instead of a distinct sec-
ondary peak for the SNe in the faint end of the luminosity distri-
bution (see also Ashall et al. 2020 and Pessi et al. 2022, although
for the i band). Ashall et al. (2020) also showed that SNe Ia i-
band light curves present different behaviors for different SN Ia
sub-types, most-likely tracing different physical aspects of these
transients. Additionally, studying how the environment of SNe Ia
affects their light curves, across multiple wavelengths, also pro-
vides useful information about the physics of these transients
(e.g. Uddin et al. 2020; Johansson et al. 2021; Ponder et al.
2021).
In this work, we perform a qualitative study of SNe Ia to un-
derstand the characteristics of their NIR light curves. We make
use of machine-learning methods, widely used by the astronomi-
cal community, to study SNe Ia and link observational properties
to their physical parameters.
The outline of this paper is the following: Sects. 2 & 3 de-
scribe the sample of SNe Ia used and the initial selection cuts; the
light-curve fits and calculation of NIR rest-frame light curves are
described in Sect. 4, and the decomposition method in Sect. 5;
the analysis of the decomposition and correlation between differ-
ent light-curve and physical parameters is presented in Sect. 6,
finalizing with the summary and conclusions in Sect. 7.
1 For an expanding ejecta, the flux is proportional to TRphot, where T
is the temperature and Rphot is the radius of the photosphere.
2. Type Ia supernova near-infrared samples
Historically, SN Ia surveys have focused on optical observations,
with only a few extending to the NIR, mainly due to a lack of
detectors at these wavelengths. However, in recent years, as NIR
array technology has significantly improved, and thanks to the
effort of several surveys, the number of SNe Ia observed at NIR
wavelengths has rapidly increased. The surveys included as part
of this work are described below.
CSP: The Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP; Hamuy et al. 2006)
provides optical and NIR (uBgVriYJH bands) observations of
336 SNe Ia, split into two samples. CSP-I contains 121 SNe Ia
from three public data releases (Contreras et al. 2010; Stritzinger
et al. 2011; Krisciunas et al. 2017a). CSP-II contains 215 SNe Ia,
described in Phillips et al. (2019) and Hsiao et al. (2019), with
an upcoming data release (Suntzeff et al. in preparation).
CfAIR2: The Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
IR2 sample (CfAIR2) consists of several data releases with
optical photometry (CfA1-5 Riess et al. 1999; Jha et al. 2006;
Hicken et al. 2009, 2012), and two including NIR photometry
(CfAIR1-2; Wood-Vasey et al. 2008; Friedman et al. 2015).
This sample includes 94 SNe Ia with UBVRIr’i’JH photometry.
RATIR: The Reionization and Transients InfraRed sample
(RATIR;
Johansson et al. 2021) presents optical and NIR
observations (UBgVrRiIzZYJH bands) of 37 SNe Ia observed
as part of the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF)
survey.
DEHVILS: The Dark Energy, H0, and peculiar Velocities using
Infrared Light from Supernovae (DEHVILS; Peterson et al.
2023) survey observed 96 SNe Ia with NIR (YJH bands)
photometry. Optical photometry of these SNe was covered
by the c and o bands of the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last
Alert System (ATLAS Tonry et al. 2018). This is additionally
complemented with ZTF g- and r-bands light curves for 78
of the 96 SNe using the Automatic Learning for the Rapid
Classification of Events (ALeRCE; Förster et al. 2021) broker.
Literature: We made a literature search for SNe Ia with available
rest-frame NIR photometry. The following objects are those that
pass the initial selection cuts discussed in Sect. 3: SNe 1998bu
(Meikle 2000), 1999ac (Phillips et al. 2006), 1999cl (Krisciunas
et al. 2006), 1999ee (Krisciunas et al. 2004b), 2000E (Valentini
et al. 2003), 2001ba (Krisciunas et al. 2004b), 2001bt (Krisci-
unas et al. 2004b), 2001el (Krisciunas et al. 2003), 2002bo
(Krisciunas et al. 2004c; Miknaitis et al. 2007), 2002cv (Elias-
Rosa et al. 2008), 2002dj (Pignata et al. 2008; Miknaitis et al.
2007), 2002fk (Cartier et al. 2014), 2003cg (Elias-Rosa et al.
2006; Miknaitis et al. 2007), 2003du (Stanishev et al. 2007),
2005df (Krisciunas et al. 2017b), SDSS3241, SDSS3331 (Freed-
man et al. 2009), 2011fe (Matheson et al. 2012), 2013dy (Pan
et al. 2015), 2014J (Foley et al. 2014; Marion et al. 2015; Sri-
vastav et al. 2016), and 2017cbv (Wee et al. 2018; Wang et al.
2020). Note that the photometry of SN 2013dy was published in
the AB magnitude system, so we convert it to the Vega magni-
tude system following Galbany et al. (2023)2.
2 AB to Vega offsets of 0.894 and 1.368 mag in J and H bands
are applied, respectively. We did not find any published AB to Vega
offset value for the Y band, so we follow the notes in https://
ratir.astroscu.unam.mx/instrument.html and apply an offset
