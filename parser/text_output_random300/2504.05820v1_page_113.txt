Chapter 4.
The Path to aN3LO Parton Distributions
This chapter is based my result presented in Refs. [3]. In particular, I have worked on the
approximation of the aN3LO splitting functions, on the computation of the necessary theoretical
calculations for the PDF fit and on the fit running.
Motivation.
Calculations of hard-scattering cross-sections at fourth perturbative order in
the strong coupling (N3LO), have been available for a long time for massless in DIS (see
Section 1.3.3), and have more recently become available for a rapidly growing set of hadron
collider processes. These include inclusive Higgs production in gluon-fusion [275, 276], bottom-
fusion [277], in association with vector bosons [278], and in vector-boson-fusion [279], Higgs
pair production [280], inclusive Drell-Yan (DY) production [281, 282], differential Higgs
production [283, 284, 285, 286, 287], and differential DY distributions [288, 289], see [290]
for an overview.
In order to obtain predictions for hadronic observables with this accuracy, these partonic cross-
sections must be combined with parton distribution functions (PDFs) determined at the same
perturbative order. These, in turn, must be determined by comparing to experimental data
theory predictions computed at the same accuracy. The main bottleneck in carrying out this
programme is the lack of exact expressions for the N3LO splitting functions that govern the scale
dependence of the PDFs: for these only partial information is available [291, 292, 293, 294,
295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302]. This information includes a set of integer N-Mellin
moments, terms proportional to nk
f with k ≥1, and the large- and small-x limits. By combining
these partial results it is possible to attempt an approximate determination of the N3LO splitting
functions [292, 298, 299, 300, 303], as was successfully done in the past at NNLO [304].
At present a global PDF determination at N3LO must consequently be based on incomplete
information: the approximate knowledge of splitting functions, and full knowledge of partonic
cross-sections only for a subset of processes. Here we use a theory covariance matrix formalism
in order to account for such the missing perturbative information, as well as nuclear uncertainties
and missing higher-order uncertainties. Equipped with such theory covariance matrices, we
can perform a determination of PDFs at “approximate N3LO” (hereafter denoted aN3LO), in
which the theory covariance matrix accounts both for incomplete knowledge of N3LO splitting
functions and massive coefficient functions (IHOUs), and for missing N3LO corrections to the
partonic cross-sections for hadronic processes (MHOUs).
We will thus present the aN3LO NNPDF4.0 PDF determination, to be added to the existing LO,
NLO and NNLO sets [109], as well as the more recent NNPDF4.0 MHOU PDFs [6] that also
