ABSTRACT
We present a multi-wavelength study of an extended area hosting the bubble N59-North to explore
the physical processes driving massive star formation (MSF). The Spitzer 8 µm image reveals an
elongated/filamentary infrared-dark cloud (length ∼28 pc) associated with N59-North, which contains
several protostars and seven ATLASGAL dust clumps at the same distance. The existence of this
filament is confirmed through 13CO and NH3 molecular line data in a velocity range of [95, 106] km
s−1. All dust clumps satisfy Kauffmann & Pillai’s condition for MSF. Using Spitzer 8 µm image, a
new embedded hub-filament system candidate (C-HFS) is investigated toward the ATLASGAL clump,
located near the filament’s central region. MeerKAT 1.3 GHz continuum emission, detected for the first
time toward C-HFS, reveals an ultracompact H ii region driven by a B2-type star, suggesting an early
stage of HFS with minimal feedback from the young massive star. The comparison of the position-
velocity (PV) and position-position-velocity (PPV) diagrams with existing theoretical models suggests
that rotation, central collapse, and end-dominated collapse are not responsible for the observed gas
motion in the filament. The PPV diagram indicates the expansion of N59-North by revealing blue- and
red-shifted gas velocities at the edge of the bubble. Based on comparisons with magnetohydrodynamic
simulations, this study suggests that cloud-cloud collision (CCC) led to the formation of the filament,
likely giving it a conical structure with gas converging toward its central region, where C-HFS is
located. Overall, the study supports multi-scale filamentary mass accretion for MSF, likely triggered
by CCC.

1. INTRODUCTION
Massive OB stars (> 8 M⊙) continuously emit ra-
diative and mechanical energy, significantly shaping the
surrounding environment throughout their existence.
However, despite their dominant impact, the processes
underlying their origin and feedback remain poorly un-
derstood and are active areas of research (Zinnecker &

et al. 2020). Earlier studies (e.g., Myers 2009; Kumar
et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2023) have estab-
lished that Hub-filament systems (HFSs), which are key
structures in the molecular clouds, play a central role in
star formation, particularly in the birth of massive stars
and star clusters.
It is worth noting that the impact
of massive OB stars on their parent molecular environ-
ment can modify the initial conditions for massive star
formation (MSF) and reshape the early configuration of
HFSs.
Therefore, studying the early stages of HFSs,
where the impact of massive stars is minimal, offers
valuable insights into the initial conditions for the devel-
opment of hubs and their massive star-forming activity
