The flat band with a stronger intensity is not only directly observed from the dispersion images
(Extended Data Fig. 8a,b), but also from the extracted spectral weight of flat band (Extended Data
Fig. 8c,f). Here we use the color and size of red dots to represent the extracted spectral weight.
The extracted spectra weight shows that the flat band has a stronger intensity in the aligned sample.
