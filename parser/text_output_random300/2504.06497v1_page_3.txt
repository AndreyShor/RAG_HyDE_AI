sentations struggle to capture. Quantum interference further refines computational outcomes
by amplifying favorable solutions while canceling out less optimal ones, thereby optimizing the
performance of quantum-enhanced algorithms.
Beyond these fundamental properties, quantum computing introduces novel approaches to in-
formation processing through specialized algorithms.
Shor’s algorithm revolutionizes crypto-
graphic security by factoring large numbers exponentially faster than classical methods [19],
while Grover’s algorithm enhances search processes with quadratic speedup [20]. In the context
of quantum machine learning, Hamiltonian evolution and variational quantum circuits exploit
quantum dynamics to encode and manipulate data in ways that classical models cannot [21].
These methods provide new avenues for feature transformation, particularly in hybrid quantum-
classical frameworks.
Despite its promise, practical quantum computing faces challenges such as decoherence, noise,
and hardware limitations. Quantum error correction schemes are being developed to mitigate
these issues, ensuring more reliable computation [21]. As quantum hardware matures, the in-
tegration of quantum-enhanced techniques with classical machine learning models is expected
to drive significant advancements in computational efficiency and predictive performance. This
study builds on these developments by exploring advanced quantum data encoding techniques
and their implications for classical machine learning, aiming to uncover new strategies for opti-
mizing data representation in hybrid quantum-classical environments.

Quantum Data
Quantum data refers to information encoded, stored, and processed using quantum bits (qubits),
which operate according to the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical data, which
exists in binary states (0s and 1s), quantum data exploits superposition, entanglement, and inter-
ference to represent and process information more efficiently. These properties enable quantum
data to encapsulate exponentially larger state spaces, facilitating more complex computations
[11].
One of the defining characteristics of quantum data is superposition, which allows qubits to
exist in a combination of states simultaneously. This property enhances computational efficiency
by enabling parallel processing of multiple states within a single computation [2]. Additionally,
entanglement establishes strong correlations between qubits, even when separated by vast dis-
tances, allowing for advanced applications in secure communication, quantum teleportation, and
distributed quantum computing. Quantum interference further refines computation by amplify-
ing desired outcomes while reducing the probability of incorrect results.
Quantum data manifests in multiple forms, each serving specific computational and crypto-
graphic purposes:
Quantum States: Quantum information is primarily represented as quantum states, which
can range from basic qubit states |0⟩and |1⟩to more complex superposition and entangled
states. These states serve as the foundation for quantum computing, quantum cryptogra-
phy, and quantum simulation.
Quantum Registers: Collections of qubits or higher-dimensional qudits are organized into
quantum registers, which function as the primary storage units in quantum algorithms and
facilitate large-scale quantum computations.
