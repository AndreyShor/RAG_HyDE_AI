The local frequency qm|m equilibrates much faster than the
global frequency pm when mutants are rare. This leads to a
convenient separation of time scales, allowing us to use the
equilibrium q∗

To calculate q∗
m|m, we first note that in the limit of rare
mutants, pm →0, and for mutant traits y close to the resident
trait x, a Taylor expansion of the right-hand side of Eq. (B6)
up to the first order becomes
˙qm|m = 2(1 −qm|m)(1 −(k −1)qm|m)

(B8)
To simplify the analysis, we can obtain the Taylor expan-
sion of q∗
m|m in y around x as
q∗
m|m = q∗(0)
m|m + q∗(1)
m|m(y −x) + O((y −x)2).
(B9)
The zero order approximation of q∗
m|m in y near x can be ob-
tained by solving for the roots of Eq. (B8) for y = x is
q∗(0)
m|m =
1
k −1.
(B10)
Next, the first-order approximation of q∗
m|m is obtained by
implicitly differentiating Eq. (B8) to y (noting that qm|m is a
function of y) and evaluating at y = x. Setting the expres-
sion to zero gives an equation for the zeroth and first-order
coefficients, q∗(0)
m|m and q∗(1)
m|m, of the Taylor expansion at the
equilibrium q∗

Then the first order coefficient q∗(1)
m|m is given as
q∗(1)
m|m =
ω(k2 −4)
2(k −1)2k(k + 1)((k+3)B′((k+1)x)−(k+1)C′(x)).
(B12)
Assembling all the pieces finally leads to the first-order expan-
sion in y of the local pair density equilibrium, q∗
m|m, around x
as

(B13)
For consistency of notation, we use x to denote the cooper-
ative investment of the mutant, so the dynamical equation can
be written as
˙x = ∂f(x, y)
∂y
|y=x.
(B14)
As a result, the dynamical equation of the continuous trait x
is given by
˙x =
ω(k −2)
(k −1)(k + 1) ((k + 3)B′((k + 1)x) −(k + 1)C′(x)) .
(B15)
Since we are considering the group size n = k + 1, it follows
that
˙x = ω(n −3)
(n −2)n ((n + 2)B′(nx) −nC′(x)) .
(B16)
The solutions of the dynamical equation ˙x = D(x) are
called singular strategies. If a singular strategy x∗exists, it
is convergent stable if
CS(x∗) = dD(x)
dx
|x=x∗
= ω(n −3)
(n −2)n ((n + 2)B′′(nx∗) −nC′′(x∗))
