[11], which categorizes using two sorts of events: signal and background.
A.
Boosted Decision Tree (BDT)
In this study, we depict three classiﬁers: MLP, LikelihoodD (Decorrelation), Boosted Decision
Tree (BDT), and Likelihood. A selection in BDT A tree is a structure that resembles a tree and
uses branching to show the many outcomes of a decision. Bypassing or failing to pass a condition
(cut) on a certain node until a decision is made, an event is classiﬁed as either a signal or a
background event. These cuts are located using the decision tree’s ”root node”. When minimum
events (NEventsMin) are speciﬁed by the BDT algorithm, the node-splitting procedure becomes
complete. The purity of the last nodes, or leaves determines their classiﬁcation. Whether p is
greater or less than the given value determines the value for the signal or background, which is
typically +1 for the signal and 0 or 1 for the background, for example, +1 if p > 0.5 and −1 if
p < 0.5 [12]. All occurrences with a classiﬁer output y > ycut are labelled as a signal, while the
remainder are categorised as background. The purity of the signal eﬃciency ϵsig,eff and background
rejection (1−ϵbkg,eff) is assessed for each cut value [13]. The ADA-Boost algorithm reweights each
misclassiﬁed event candidate. A reduced layout, known as multilayer perception (MLP), can also
be used to speed up processing. An Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) is made up of three diﬀerent
types of layers: an input layer with nvar neurones and a bias neurone; many deep layers with
a user-speciﬁed number of neurones (set in the HiddenLayers option) plus a bias node; and an
output layer with weights assigned to each connection between two neurones.

Likelihood Ratio
The Likelihood ratio yL(j) for j the number of signal and background events is deﬁned by:
yL(j) =
LS(j)
LS(j) + LB(j)

The candidate to be signal/background can be determined by:
LS/B(j) =
nvar
Y
i=1
PS/B,i(xi(j))

Where PDF PS/B is for the ith input variable. The normalized PDF i is:
Z −∞

PS/B,i(xi)dxi = 1
