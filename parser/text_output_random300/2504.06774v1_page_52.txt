HOSVD with 3 dense layers
Figure A1 shows the predicted snapshots of the HOSVD-based model for the LSTM
architecture with 3 dense layers, and the hyper-tuned parameters are shown in Table A1.

Analysis of the POD Modes
Figure A4 presents the first ten normalized spatial POD modes from the turbulent ex-
perimental cylinder case, highlighting the different flow regions. The spatial POD modes
from 1 to 5 capture the dominant large-scale structures in the flow, including the wake
