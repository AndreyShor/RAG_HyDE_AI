Figure 1: Sensitivity of SHiP to various new physics particles: Heavy Neutral Leptons or HNLs (top, left), dark
photons (top, right), Higgs-like scalars S with the trilinear coupling to the Higgs boson fixed by Br(h →SS) =
0.01 (bottom, left), and inelastic dark matter coupled via dark photons (bottom, right). The solid blue lines show
the sensitivities per 15-year running time of SHiP. For HNLs, the dashed blue line corresponds to the sensitivity
per one-year nominal running time as expected in Run 4. In the case of other models, the relation between the
1-year and 15-year sensitivities is qualitatively the same. For Higgs-like scalars, the red line shows the sensitivity
to events with two decaying scalars per event [14]. The light bands around the lines denote the effect of theoretical
uncertainty in the production and decays of FIPs on their sensitivity [15,16]; for dark photons, the light-gray region
indicates the impact of the uncertainty on the existing constraints.
the whole parameter space where HNLs is capable of explaining neutrino oscillations (i.e., the
HNL couplings above the so-called “seesaw limit”.)
– SHiP’s detector for scattering signatures and a possible extension of SHiP with a liquid argon
detector may search for unique signatures and identify classes of FIPs [13]: double-scattering sig-
natures with soft recoil (smoking gun signature for millicharged particles), the combined signature
with scattering and subsequent decay (typical signatures for HNLs coupled via dipole operator and
inelastic dark matter).

Neutrino physics
Proton interactions on the BDF target produce a very intense neutrino flux of all three flavours. The use
of a long and high-density target is ideal to enrich the neutrino yield of tau neutrinos, since most of the
light long-lived mesons are forced to interact before they decay, thus enhancing the fraction of neutrinos
from the prompt charmed and beauty hadron decays. This feature greatly enhances the tau and the
electron neutrino components over the muon neutrinos, allowing unique studies of their interactions with
matter. More than 90% of the electron neutrinos interacting in the neutrino detector target are expected
to originate from charmed hadron decays. Therefore, systematic uncertainties from the neutrino flux
