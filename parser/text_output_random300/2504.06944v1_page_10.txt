Section 4.5. There does not appear to be any trends based on regolith type or particle size in 
Figure 8 either, as data points are well distributed around the dashed trendline. 
 
Figure 8. Observed volumetric erosion rates plotted against the calculated volumetric erosion rate due to                                   
viscous erosion (eq. 1) with constant K = 2,  = 0.5 and  = Cohesion, C; Dashed line represents                                               
where observed rates and calculated rates from eq. 1 are equal (line with a slope of 1). 
Of note, while  in eq. 1 has been theorized to represent cohesive energy density (in units of 
J/m3), the X-axis values in Figure 8 have been calculated using cohesion, C, from eq. 3 (in units 
of Pa), which ultimately reduces to the same units. Additionally, when calculating rates for 
volumetric erosion (X-axis) in Figure 8, the constants K and  have been set to 2 cm/s and 0.5, 
respectively. This assumed value for =0.5 is taken from previous calculations by Metzger 
(2024a), while K was determined calculating a goodness-of-fit (R2) between the observed data 
to the dashed line in Figure 8 (slope of 1, intercept) for various values of K. As shown in Figure 
9, the best good-of-fit (R2) value was calculated to be 0.72, corresponding to K  6.3 cm/s  2 
cm/s.  
 
 
Figure 9. Relationship between goodness-of-fit (R2) and values for constant, K (eq. 1) when fitting observed                     
volumetric erosion rates; As shown in Figure 8, the best fit of observed volumetric erosion rate data occurs                              
when K = 2 cm/s, which corresponds to R2 = 0.72.
