Figure 13. Comparison of the minimum choice of m for both methods under the same accuracy requirement, with
varying time interval length T. The condition number and success probability Psucc of the corresponding linear system
at these values of m are also compared.
From the results, we observe that the method based on Padé approximation consistently outperforms the
method based on Taylor approximation, with the gap growing more significant as T increases. A smaller
m∗directly benefits the block-encoding of the linear operator, since the gate complexity in Eq. (29) depends
on m. Moreover, the query complexity of the QLSA is linearly dependent on the condition number of the
corresponding linear system, so a smaller condition number significantly improves the solving process. In
this experiment, we set p = 1. However, to further boost the success probability Psucc, a suitable choice
of p > 1 could be employed for both methods. A larger success probability in the p = 1 case implies that
the corresponding method requires a smaller p to achieve the desired success probability. Furthermore, the
condition number of Lm,k,p(Ah) and Cm,k,p(Ah) depends linearly on the parameter p, and thus the efficiency
of QLSA is thus also linearly dependent on p.
The first two experiments compare the two methods using a specific choice of matrix A. However, since all
Hermitian matrices are unitarily diagonalizable, the results from these experiments capture the behavior of
all Hermitian and negative semi-definite matrices. These results support our theoretical analysis for this class
of matrices: the condition number and success probability of the proposed method remain well-controlled,
even when m ≪∥AT∥2.
Experiment 3: The set of Hermitian and negative semi-definite matrices is a subset of the broader class
of matrices whose eigenvalues have negative real parts. Within this broader class, the method based on
Padé approximation is also expected to outperform the method based on Taylor approximation. However,
providing a theoretical analysis for this more general case is challenging. To investigate this further, we
conduct a numerical comparison between the two methods on matrices from this broader class.
Let ϵ = 10−10, k = 9, p = 1 and x0 = b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]T . We generate one hundred matrices A ∈C5×5
randomly, where each matrix’s eigenvalues have negative real parts. For each matrix A and each time interval
T = 1, . . . , 50, we determine the smallest value of m that achieves the desired accuracy ϵ, denoted by m∗.
With the parameters k = 9, p = 1, and m = m∗, we construct the corresponding linear systems and compute
the condition number and success probability for each linear system. Finally, we calculate the mean value
and standard deviation over the one hundred samples. The results are plotted in Fig. 14.
The results in Fig. 14 demonstrate that the Padé approximation-based method consistently outperforms
the Taylor approximation-based method across all three compared metrics, on average. Notably, the gap
between the two methods widens as T increases.
This experiment highlights that the proposed method
remains more efficient for a broader class of matrices.

Numerical result of scenario II
Experiment 4: In scenario II, we always choose m = ⌈∥AT∥2⌉. Therefore, it suffices to compare the two
methods for the case where T = 1 and ∥A∥2 = 1.
In this experiment, we set m = p = 1, x0 = b =
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]T , and generate one hundred matrices A ∈C5×5 with eigenvalues having negative real parts and
spectral norm equal 1. For each A and a required precision ϵ, we determine the smallest k that achieves the
required precision, denoted by k∗. With parameters m = p = 1 and k = k∗, we construct the corresponding
