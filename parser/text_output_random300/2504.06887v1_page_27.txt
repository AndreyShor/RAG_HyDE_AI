Figure 11: Plots for the comparison of Minkowski and HHI states mutual information near the horizon with two static
detectors having coupling that respects the conformal symmetry
In terms of κ ≡(1/2)f ′(r = Rs) and l ≡(r - Rs), with f(r) = (1 −Rs/r), the above metric in Eq. (83) is expressed as

This is precisely the metric of a Rindler observer in flat Minkowski spacetime. The stress-energy tensor for the Unruh
vacua exhibits divergences near the past horizons. While the stress-energy tensor for the Boulware vacuum has divergence
on both future and past event horizons. The divergence underscores the significance of considering the influence of the
matter sector in shaping the spacetime geometry, signaling a deviation from the semiclassical regime in the vicinity of
the horizon. In contrast, there is no such divergence for the HHI state. In a flat spacetime scenario, the expectation
value of stress energy in the Rindler vacuum is divergent near the horizon, whereas no such divergence is present for the
expectation value in the Minkowski vacuum. The equivalence principle implies that the local gravitational effect felt by
a static detector is equivalent to an acceleration in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, a uniformly accelerating detector
in flat space experiences Unruh radiation, analogous to the Hawking radiation encountered by a static detector in the
HHI state. These observations prompt us to draw a comparison between the near-horizon properties of the HHI vacuum
for a static observer and the Minkowski vacuum for a uniformly accelerated observer, i.e., a Rindler observer.
From Eq.(50), the mutual information between two disjoint intervals in the HHI vacuum is given by
