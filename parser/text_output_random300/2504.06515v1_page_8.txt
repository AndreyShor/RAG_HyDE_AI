which follow from reducing the constraint Equations (19) and (20) via the canonical reduc-
tion procedure. Note that Œ® is a function of the dynamical variables (za, pa) of the particles,
as stated above.
The expression (23) is analogous to the reduced Hamiltonian in (3 + 1) dimensional
general relativity [98,100,101]. Equation (24) can be shown to be an energy balance condi-
tion: the energy of the gravitational Ô¨Åeld (expressed in terms of (Œ®, œÄ) and the cosmological
constant Œõ) plus the relativistic energy of motion of the particles must add to zero. Likewise,
(25) expresses the fact that the total momentum of the gravitational Ô¨Åeld and the particles
must add to zero.
Two interesting approximations can be obtained from (23) and the constraint equations.
One is an expansion in powers of the coupling Œ∫‚Äîthe weak-Ô¨Åeld expansion. The other is
an expansion in inverse powers of c‚Äîthe post-Newtonian expansion.
The Œ∫-expansion can be carried out by solving (24) for ‚ñ≥Œ® and inserting the result
into (23). Setting Œõ = 0 for simplicity, this yields

must vanish. Here, there is a subtle problem in comparison to the (3 + 1)‚Äìdimensional
setting because the dimensionless potential Gm|x|/c2 becomes inÔ¨Ånite at spatial inÔ¨Ånity. It
is straightforward to show that, if the function f (x) ‚â°Œ®2 ‚àí4Œ∫2œá2 and its Ô¨Årst derivative
vanish for | x |>>| za | for all a, then the surface term (27) vanishes, since it is a sum of the
terms proportional to f ‚Ä≤ and (4 ‚àíŒ®) f ‚Ä≤ + f Œ®‚Ä≤.
The Œ∫-expansion is the successive approximation of the ROGS in the background of
Minkowskian space‚Äìtime. At each order in Œ∫, the relativistic form is preserved, and so this
approximation is appropriate for describing the relativistic motion of the particles in weak
gravitational Ô¨Åelds.
