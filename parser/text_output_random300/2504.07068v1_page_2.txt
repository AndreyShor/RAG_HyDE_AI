even without the issues in the limit of the error, the rate is multi-letter and hard to compute.
The structure of the paper is as follows: At the end of this section, we brieﬂy introduce the notation used in this
paper. In Section II we rigorously deﬁne the channel simulation model. We discuss a decoupling lemma in Sec III, and
introduce two functionals, which characterize the simulation rates. We obtain the optimal simulation rates assuming
that the parties share free entanglement and no entanglement in Sec IV and Sec V, respectively. We discuss our
results in Sec VI. In the Appendix, we introduce and prove some lemmas that we apply throughout the paper.
Notation. In this paper, quantum systems are associated with ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces A, R, etc., whose
dimensions are denoted by |A|, |R|, respectively. The von Neumann entropy is deﬁned as
S(ρ) := −Tr ρ log ρ.
Throughout this paper, log denotes by default the binary logarithm. The conditional entropy and the conditional
mutual information, S(A|B)ρ and I(A : B|C)ρ, respectively, are deﬁned in the same way as their classical counterparts:
S(A|B)ρ = S(AB)ρ −S(B)ρ, and
I(A : B|C)ρ = S(A|C)ρ −S(A|BC)ρ
= S(AC)ρ + S(BC)ρ −S(ABC)ρ −S(C)ρ.
The ﬁdelity between two states ρ and ξ is deﬁned as F(ρ, ξ) = ∥√ρ√ξ∥1 = Tr

SETUP
We assume that an arbitrary channel N : A →BK is given with all the associated dimensions speciﬁed, along with
a state ρAR on the input and some reference system A and R. Let σBKR = (N ⊗idR)ρAR, and UN : A →BKG be
the Stinespring dilation of N. We consider n copies of the state ρAR.
We call the sender or the encoder Alice, and the receiver or the decoder Bob. We suppose that Alice and Bob
initially share some entangled state |Φ⟩A0B0 in systems A0B0. Alice applies an encoding channel CAnA0→MKnA1
n
, and
sends system M to Bob. Receiving M, Bob applies a decoding channel DMB0→BnB1
n
. We deﬁne
