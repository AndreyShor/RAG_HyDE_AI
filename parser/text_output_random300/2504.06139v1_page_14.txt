• if CHSH(P) < 4 then CHSH(N [P]) < 4.
It is important to understand that the second statement of theorem 12 ap-
plies only to correlations that can be obtained by measurements on quantum
states. As we will see in section 5.2.1, some protocols bring boxes of CHSH
value near 2 and brings them to 3 > 2
√
2, but these cannot be simulated by
measurements on quantum states.
Short[19] proved the impossibility of distillation protocols operating on
two copies of noisy PR-boxes.
Theorem 13. Two copies of a noisy PR-box cannot be distilled. For any
Pǫ = ǫP P R + (1 −ǫ)P P R, there is no N 2 such that CHSH(N 2[Pǫ]) >
CHSH(Pǫ).
His proof, which applies to more general frameworks than just non-local
boxes, works by showing that the probability that the protocol simulates
a PR-box as a function of the same probability for the initial boxes is a
polynomial of degree two in the original probability. He then shows a set of
constraints that no polynomial of degree two can satisfy.
5.2
Known Distillation Protocols
In this section, we consider only protocols achieving distillation of correla-
tions outside the quantum set.
All known distillation protocols are applied to the same family of boxes,
termed correlated non-local boxes by Brunner and Skrzypczyk[6]. Correlated
non-local boxes are of the form P C
ǫ
= ǫP P R + (1 −ǫ)P C where P C is the
fully correlated box P C(ab|xy) = 1/2 if a⊕b = 0. Correlated non-local boxes
have a CHSH value of 2(ǫ + 1) > 2. What characterizes these boxes is their
bias towards correlated outputs, i.e. a ⊕b = 0. This means that when the
box outputs uncorrelated bits, you are assured that it has output the correct
answer. Both protocols presented here will make use of this fact.
Non-locality distillation protocols can however be applied to any box of
the non-signalling polytope. Whether a protocol distills or not a given box
depends on its joint probability distribution.
