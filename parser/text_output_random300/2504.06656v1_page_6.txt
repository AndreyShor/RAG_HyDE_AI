increases as mass of charged Higgs increases and approaches a value of 2.19768531×10−2 at MH±,
as shown in Figure. 4Total decay width of charged Higgs for three benchmark pointsﬁgure.4. For
the banchark point of BP2 the decay width at MH± = 100 GeV is 1.78125348×10−3 and at MH± =
190 GeV the decay width reaches a value of 8.51582463×10−2. For BP3 Γ is 9.39734689×10−5 at
charge Higgs mass 100 GeV and reaches a value of 1.09070331×10−1 for mass of MH± = 190 GeV .
From this, we can see that the most dominant benchmark scenario for total decay width is BP3
in which the charged Higgs decay width approaches a value 1.09070331 × 10−1 for a higher mass
of charged Higgs, shown in Figure. 4Total decay width of charged Higgs for three benchmark
pointsﬁgure.4.

MULTIVARIATE TECHNIQUES FOR CHARGED HIGGS PRODUCTION STUDIES
In the late 1980s, multivariate data analysis underwent a revolution thanks to the power of
computers and signiﬁcant advancements in machine learning techniques, most notably the back-
propagation algorithms for training neural networks (NNs). Nowadays, the machine learning ap-
proach is used in a wide range of diﬀerent algorithms to search for new physics in high-energy
particle physics. In this work, we have used an integrated root framework for parallel running and
computation work with diﬀerent multivariate techniques called “Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis”
