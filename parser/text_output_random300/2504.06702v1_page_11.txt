d = 3N. In gr-qubits, |0⟩= |g1⟩and |1⟩= |r⟩, again interacting with VdW interactions. For this choice of qubit,
the Rydberg blockade may cause a part of the computational space to become unreachable. Lastly, we can again
consider |0⟩= |g1⟩and |1⟩= |r⟩but now with Dipole-Dipole interactions. This configuration would not have the
problem of the Rydberg blockade but is experimentally harder to facilitate [28].
As also mentioned in the main text, we will take the interaction strength coefficient C3,6 = 1 in arbitrary units. All
subsequent pulse strengths and interatomic distances are expressed in terms of this interaction energy coefficient.
Note that for other units, time can always be rescaled so that C3,6 = 1 by the Schr¨odinger equation (1).
