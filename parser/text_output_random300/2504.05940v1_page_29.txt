2. Since f(σ1, σ2) is arbitrary, we require that the gauge restriction condi-
tion remain unchanged under any volume-preserving deformation (VPD),
regardless of the choice of f.
3. As a result, the VPD parameters Q1 and Q2 are subject to constraints
such as
{Q1, Q2} = 0, ∂σ3τ(Q1, Q2) = 0,
(B.57)
which deﬁne the Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformation (RVPD).
4. In order to eliminate solutions of the form
{Q1, Q2} = C(σ1, σ2)
σ3
,
(B.58)
we assume suﬃcient smoothness with respect to σ3. These lead to C(σ1, σ2) =
0, ensuring that {Q1, Q2} = 0.
5. Altogether, in order to preserve the freedom introduced by the arbitrary
integration constant f, the VPD must be strongly restricted, resulting in
the RVPD structure.
This chain of logic shows that any deformation preserving the gauge restriction
condition must take a highly restricted form.
In particular, it implies that
reparametrizations in the σ3 direction are eﬀectively prohibited.
This means that the gauge transformation parameters along σ3 cannot vary
freely, as they are constrained by conditions such as {Q1, Q2} = 0, which re-
stricts the extent to which reparametrizations in the σ3 direction can be per-
formed.
B.5 Conceptual Summary and Interpretation
With this, we have completed the proofs of both the suﬃcient and necessary
conditions.
By introducing the gauge restriction condition and deﬁning the Restricted
Volume-Preserving Deformation (RVPD) accordingly, we are able to preserve
key structural properties of the theory—such as the composition law of trans-
formations and invariance—even after quantization via matrix regularization.
This approach is fundamentally diﬀerent from the conventional idea of gauge
ﬁxing as the elimination of redundant degrees of freedom.
Instead, it should be understood as a structural constraint imposed in order
to preserve the algebraic consistency of the theory.
