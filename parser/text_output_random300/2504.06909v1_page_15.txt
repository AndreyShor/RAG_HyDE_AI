Fig. 6. Changes in meridional energy transport divergence between the superrotating run (ùêπ0 = 4 m.s‚àí1.day‚àí1)
and the control run (ùêπ0 = 0 m.s‚àí1.day‚àí1), averaged over three regions: tropics (15‚ó¶S to 15‚ó¶N), subtropics (40‚ó¶S
to 15‚ó¶S and 15‚ó¶N to 40‚ó¶N), and mid-/high-latitudes (90‚ó¶S to 40‚ó¶S and 40‚ó¶N to 90‚ó¶N), for interactive- (blue bars)
and fixed-SST runs (pink bars). The mean meridional circulation (orange arrows) and eddies (green arrows)
components of these changes are shown.

interactive-SST runs and 15‚ó¶for the fixed-SST runs), with a minimum near 10‚ó¶, positive in the
mid-latitudes, until about 55‚ó¶(50‚ó¶in the fixed-SST runs) and with a maximum near 35‚ó¶(30‚ó¶in
the fixed SST runs), and negative further poleward.
This indicates that the MMC drives the total energy transport changes in the tropics and high
latitudes, and the eddies do in the subtropics. As a result, the change in net MSE flux divergence
is negative in the tropics and mid-latitudes, and positive in the subtropics (Fig. 6).
While the general conclusions in the above paragraph apply qualitatively to the fixed-SST and
interactive-SST runs, the former exhibit a number of specific features. To start, there is a small
region around the equator (roughly 5‚ó¶north and south) where the effect of eddies dominates the
transport changes, resulting in increased poleward transport compared to the control run, but this is
more than compensated for by the changes in the rest of the tropics and the net energy transport into
the whole region (approximately 0‚ó¶-10‚ó¶) remains larger than in the control run. More generally,
the net transport changes follows more closely the eddy component, due to the smaller contribution
of the MMC at low latitudes (compared to the interactive-SST case) associated with less drastic
