In the near horizon limit, UM1 â†’0 , UM2 â†’0 and VMs â†’âˆš2lsegÏ„/âˆšg. Here â€˜gâ€™ is the acceleration parameter of the
Rindler observer. Furthermore, taking both intervals on Ï„ = constant hypersurface Eq.(88) becomes

Identifying ls = r âˆ’Rs we get IMink â‰ˆIHHI. Therefore, near the horizon, the mutual information between two nearby
disjoint intervals in both situations is equivalent.
To see the equivalence of the entanglement properties from the point of view of an UDW detector, let us consider
two UDW detectors, namely A and B, along the following trajectories in the Minkowski vacuum.

Detector A: tA = 1

where Ï„A and Ï„B are proper time in the frame of detectors A and B, respectively, xâ€™s and tâ€™s are their Minkowski
coordinates, and gA and gB are their accelerations. We take eventsâ€™ common line of simultaneity in both detector frames
to pass from the origin of chosen coordinates, namely
tA
xA
= tB
xB
(92)
Imposing the above constraints on trajectories Eqs. (90) and (91) we get
tanh gAÏ„A = tanh gBÏ„B
(93)
Now, since the arguments are real, we can utilize the fact that hyperbolic functions are one-to-one to write gAÏ„A = gBÏ„B.
Therefore, the trajectory becomes

We choose lA = 1/2g and fix lB such that the above proper distance corresponds to the same proper distance between

With the above parameters and the two point function W HHI
Ïˆ,c
shown in Eq.(18), we repeat the entanglement harvesting
protocol discussed in section 4.2 for two static UDWs in HHI and two uniformly accelerating UDWs in the Minkowski
vacuum. The result is displayed in Fig. 11. One observes from Fig. 11 that the total correlation near the horizon in
both of these situations, namely the HHI state for a static observer near the horizon and the Minkowski vacuum for a
uniformly accelerated observer follows a similar trend. It is also apparent that as we move farther from the horizon, the
disparity in correlations between the two scenarios increases. This observation suggests that the similarity in correlations
between the two situations is primarily limited to the vicinity of the horizon.
