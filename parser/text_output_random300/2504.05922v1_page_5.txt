Internal conversion between electronic states of
different symmetry
Using pyrazine as an example, we now present a sce-
nario where single-trajectory mean-field methods, includ-
ing TGED, completely fail to capture electronic popu-
lation transfer. Pyrazine belongs to the D2h symmetry
group and contains a conical intersection between the po-
tential energy surfaces of the first two excited adiabatic
electronic states. In the 3-dimensional, 3-state vibronic
coupling Hamiltonian model constructed by Woywod et
al.36, the diabatic S1 and S2 electronic states transform
according to the B3u and B2u irreducible representations,
respectively, and are coupled through a vibrational mode
Q10a of B1g symmetry. The two totally symmetric modes
Q1 and Q6a, represented in Fig. 2(a) together with Q10a,
are also included in the model.
The cut of the potential, shown in Fig. 2(b), shows
that the three potential energy curves share the same
equilibrium position along Q10a. Combined with the lin-
ear diabatic couplings between the excited states, the
symmetry-imposed geometry of the diabatic surfaces has
significant consequences for single-trajectory mean-field
methods, leading to a breakdown in their ability to prop-
erly describe nonadiabatic dynamics. In particular, a sin-
gle Ehrenfest trajectory initialized on V22 at the Franck-
Condon point feels no force in the direction of the Q10a
mode and no diabatic coupling. Consequently, in the ab-
sence of initial momentum, population transfer cannot
occur, as illustrated in Fig. 2(c). Regrettably, the issue
persists with TGED, despite the presence of a nuclear
wavefunction. The reason is that the expectation value
of the linear diabatic coupling in Eq. (15) vanishes for
a Gaussian wavepacket centered at the Franck-Condon
point. This illustrates that TGED only partially incor-
porates nuclear quantum effects. Conversely, multitra-
jectory Ehrenfest dynamics overcomes this limitation by
initializing trajectories with positions and momenta ran-
domly sampled from the initial Gaussian wavepacket, en-
abling population transfer. Compared with the exact re-
sult, multitrajectory Ehrenfest dynamics accurately cap-
tures the diabatic population of the S2 state for the first
1000 a.u. and provides a reliable qualitative estimate up
to 6000 a.u.
C.
Symmetry of conical intersections
The absence of nonadiabatic effects in pyrazine when
single-trajectory mean-field methods are used is not an
isolated exception, but occurs for the vast majority of
conical intersections represented in the literature by the
vibronic coupling Hamiltonian. Understanding this effect
requires analyzing the selection rule that determines the
existence of conical intersections and the impact on their
geometry.
Conical intersections are named this way because
they form a cone-like shape in the adiabatic representa-
tion within the two-dimensional g-h branching plane37,
spanned by the energy difference gradient vector g and
the interstate coupling vector h. The corresponding nu-
clear coordinates are commonly referred to as the tuning
mode Qt and the coupling mode Qc. As explained by
Yarkony38, the specific roles of these coordinates can be
understood from a simple 2×2 diabatic potential matrix,
