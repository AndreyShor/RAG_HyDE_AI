field-cooling (FC) protocols, indicating a Néel temperature of 196 K (Fig. S2). The distinct 
magnetic hysteresis loops with out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields show that FCGT 
has a good PMA. Particularly, we observe a metamagnetic transition when H//c: the two 
spin sublattices start to snap at ~10 kOe and saturates to the same direction at ~23 kOe at 
100 K. By contrast, when H//ab, the two spin sublattices exhibits a continuous canting 
along the direction of magnetic fields, confirming the PMA in FCGT. We then obtain the 
phase diagram of spin alignment at different temperatures and out-of-plane magnetic fields 
(Fig. 1g) and quantify the magnetic parameters of interlayer exchange coupling JAF and 
magnetic anisotropy energy Ku by fitting magnetic hysteresis loops with the two-spin 
macrospin model28 (Supplementary Note 2).  
Intrinsic net magnetic moment in Pt/FCGT 
We mechanically exfoliate the FCGT crystal into nm-thick flakes using Scotch tapes. 
The FCGT flakes with a thickness of 5-10 nm and lateral dimension of ~10 μm are then 
transferred onto a 200 nm-thick SiO2 layer on a Si substrate in the glovebox enclosure with 
inert argon atmosphere. We sputter a 7 nm-thick Pt layer on the exfoliated FCGT flakes to 
create the Pt/FCGT heterostructure that is further patterned into Hall devices (Fig. 2a). The 
top Pt layer can serve as the protection layer preventing the oxidation of FCGT as well as 
the source of spin current due to its strong spin-orbit coupling. In the FCGT flake, the net 
magnetic moment is 𝛅𝛅𝒎𝒎= ∑

 and the Néel vector is defined as: 𝒏𝒏= 𝒎𝒎𝟏𝟏−𝒎𝒎𝟐𝟐, 
where mi is the unit magnetic moment of the ith layer from the top surface and N is the 
number of vdW layers (shown in the inset of Fig. 2a).  
To study the magnetic properties of the Pt/FCGT heterostructure, we perform the 
anomalous Hall effect (AHE) measurement with a relatively low current of 1 mA. The 
AHE hysteresis loops in Pt/FCGT devices are similar to that of the FCGT crystal (Figs. 2b 
and 2c), showing that the antiferromagnetism has been well preserved during the nano-
fabrication process. Interestingly, we observe a sizable Hall resistance remanence δRH that 
vanishes concurrently at the Néel temperature in some Pt/FCGT heterostructures (Fig. S4). 
We attribute the presence of δRH to the uncompensated magnetic moment in the FCGT 
flake with odd-number vdW layers. To verify this, we quantify the vdW layer numbers in 
the Pt/FCGT devices with and without δRH by using HR-TEM. As shown in Figs. 2d and 
2e, there is a sharp and clean interface between the Pt and FCGT layers. The vdW layer
