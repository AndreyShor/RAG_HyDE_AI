likely via Auger recombination––the recombination of one exciton leads to the 
ionization of the other exciton. It should be noted that, it is hard to extract hot-electron 
transfer from the AM dynamics of MoSe2, since which involves multiple other effects, 
such as interaction between photo-excited excitons and doped electrons, electron-hole 
recombination, and temperature change.   
We further explore the power dependence of hot-electron extraction with electron 
doped and neutral MoSe2, as shown in Figure 4a and b, respectively. For doped MoSe2, 
when the pump fluence increases, 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 shows overall increase and faster rise dynamics. 
In Figure 4c, 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸,𝑚𝑚 exhibits a sublinear power dependence that gives enhanced hot-
electron extraction efficiency for a lower pump fluence (Figure 4d). This is a favored 
character for photovoltaic applications under weak illumination intensity, such as 
sunlight, in contrast to the hot-phonon bottle neck effect that requires high illumination 
intensity5,6. Moreover, for neutral MoSe2, 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸,𝑚𝑚 shows a linear-like power 
dependence with the extrapolation deviating from the origin (Figure 4c), which gives 
increased hot-electron extraction efficiency for a higher pump fluence (Figure 4d). See 
Figure S11 for the corresponding ∆𝑇𝑇∗ dynamics. 
The power dependence of the hot-electron extraction efficiency can be understood in 
terms of the aforementioned mechanism (Figure 3). As the pump fluence increases, the 
amount of the excess energy to be dissipated increases. However, for a given electron-
doping density, the dissipation capacity of the Fermi sea is limited by the scattering rate
