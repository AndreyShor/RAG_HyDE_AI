lurium atoms are all stronger than interchain bonds between
tellurium atoms. Because of this it is possible for the blue
atomic chain to be drawn out from the crystal surface by the
STM tip without the Te chain or the STM tip or the bond be-
ween them breaking. A resulting structure is shown in Fig.2.
Te atomic helices can be characterized by their twist angles
ϕ per atom about the axis of the helix,16 defined in the inset
of Fig.2. For the Te helices making up a Te crystal the twist
angle is 120◦. Recently it has been predicted16 that for single
isolated long regular Te atomic helices the twist angle should
be smaller, approximately 106◦. However, this prediction is
yet to be tested experimentally. For the blue Te atomic chain
shown in Fig.2 the helical twist angle varies between ∼102◦
and 110◦except near the Te crystal substrate.This is consistent
with the above prediction,16 that the twist angle for a free-
standing Te helix should be substantially smaller than that for
Te helices in Te crystals.
While the Te atomic chain is being stretched between the
gold STM tip and the Te substrate it is under tension, which
should inhibit its collapse into a compact disordered cluster
such as those predicted in Ref.16.

CONCLUSION
Although tellurium atomic chains encapsulated in a variety
of hosts have been studied experimentally for more than 40
years, pristine free-standing Te atomic chains have still not
been realized in the laboratory. Here it has been shown based
on ab initio simulations that a pristine free-standing tellurium
atomic helix can be drawn from a tellurium crystal surface
with the help of a gold STM tip. While this helix is under
tension it should not collapse into a tangled compact cluster.
For the Te helix realised in this way the p-type semiconductor
Te crystal substrate and gold STM tip provide suitable con-
tacts for transport measurements on a pristine isolated helical
Te atomic chain that have until now not been possible.
