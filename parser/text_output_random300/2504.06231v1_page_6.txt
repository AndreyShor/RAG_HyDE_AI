Table 1: Matbench results for a range of Orb-v3 models. Orb-v3 models perform competitively,
whilst having significantly improved speed and memory profiles. Note that results for *-omat
models on the discovery portion of the benchmark are not included, as OMat24 uses PBE54
VASP pseudopotentials, making them incompatible with the WBM test set. See Appendix J for
an analysis of how these datasets result in broadly similar potentials.
Physical Property Predictions
Ultimately, the goal of developing general purpose MLIPs is to enable efficient and high-fidelity
predictions of materials properties at scale. Benchmark performance on relative targets, such
as F1 with respect to a predefined energy hull, does not necessarily transfer into accurate and
reliable prediction of physical properties; this is well demonstrated by the new Matbench
thermal conductivity benchmark. In this Section, we aim to provide a more comprehensive
evaluation of Orb-v3 as well as other models from literature in terms of their ability to predict
material properties ‚Äì beyond what is included in Matbench Discovery. We believe this is
important for scientists and engineers who wish to decide on which model they will use to fuel
their computational research.
In addition to the Matbench suite of evaluations, we also consider the MDR phonon benchmark
[18, 26, 40], which presents a database of roughly ten thousand materials along with their
vibrational and derived thermodynamic properties as computed at the PBE and PBEsol levels
using Phonopy. This benchmark is more comprehensive than the one included in Matbench
since (1) its reference dataset is two orders of magnitude larger, and (2) it covers a wider range of
physical observables depending on both the low- and high-frequency behavior of the material.
Second, we evaluate the models‚Äô ability to predict mechanical stability, based on a large subset
of about ten thousand materials with precomputed PBE-level bulk and shear moduli from
MP [42]. These mechanical properties are complimentary to those obtained using (constant
cell) phonon calculations, and the combination of these two benchmarks comprises a total of
six physical properties. Note that in the present evaluation, all six properties rely on finite
difference estimates of higher-order PES derivatives and therefore require a MLIP to have a
sufficiently smooth PES for successful evaluation.
