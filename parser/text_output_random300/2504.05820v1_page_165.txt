Table 5.3: Same as Table 5.1 for single-inclusive jet and dijet production data. The original numerical
codes used for the predictions have been modified to allow for the generation of PineAPPL
grids.
accounting for missing higher orders, estimated by varying the renormalization scale, as
we will explain in Section 5.1.2.
The total number of data points included in our study, after applying the aforementioned
kinematic cuts, is Ndat = 951, irrespective of the perturbative accuracy of the determination.
The corresponding kinematic coverage in the (x, Q2) plane is displayed in Fig. 5.1. For W ±-
boson, single-inclusive jet, and dijet production in polarized proton-proton collisions, LO
kinematic relations have been used to determine x and Q2 from the relevant hadronic variables.
As can be seen from Fig. 5.1, the largest number of data points correspond to polarized inclusive
DIS measurements. Because of the very moderate values of the virtuality Q2, the scattering
involves the exchange of a virtual photon. At LO, these measurements are therefore sensitive
only to the singlet PDF flavor combination, whereas the sensitivity to the gluon PDF, which
enters only at higher orders, is suppressed by powers of the strong coupling. Sensitivity to
valence-like PDF flavor combinations is achieved thanks to W ±-boson production measurements
in polarized proton-proton collisions, which is a parity-violating process. Complementary to this
are measurements of single-hadron production in DIS, that however we do not consider because
they require the simultaneous knowledge of FFs. Sensitivity to the gluon PDF is achieved thanks
to single-inclusive jet and dijet production measurements in polarized proton-proton collisions,
which account for almost all the rest of our dataset. Additional constraints on the gluon PDF
may come from measurements of two other processes: single-hadron production in polarized
proton-proton collisions, which we do not consider because of the need for the simultaneous
knowledge of FFs; and open-charm production in DIS, which we do not consider because the
available datasets were demonstrated to bring in a negligible amount of information [331].
The complete information on experimental uncertainties, including on their correlations, is
taken into account whenever available from the HEPDATA repository [364] or from the corre-
