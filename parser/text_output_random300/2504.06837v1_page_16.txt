Next, we deﬁne the embedding operator ιN : M(XN) →M(X) by
ιN(ci)(x) := ρi(x) :=

k (x).
Dual to it, we introduce the discretization operator ι∗
N : C(X) →C(XN) by setting
ι∗
Nξi,k := (ι∗

For the diﬀusive ﬂuxes we introduce ιN,diﬀ: M+(YN,diﬀ) →M(Ydiﬀ) deﬁned by
ιN,diﬀFi(x) := fi(x) = (fi,e1(x), . . . , fi,ed(x))⊤

where for e ∈E we set

Finally, for the reactive ﬂuxes we deﬁne ιN,react : M+(YN,react) →M(Yreact) by

Using the above embedding operator is is clear that EN(c) = E(ιN(c)) and analogous iden-
tities hold for other integral functionals as well. Moreover, by construction, s 7→fi,e(x+se) is
piecewise aﬃne, whereas s 7→fi,e(x+sˆe) is piecewise constant for ˆe ̸= e. Moreover, by deﬁnition
we have for all i ∈I and all e ∈E the estimate

and for all r ∈R the estimate

Denoting the discrete L1-norms on L1(Zd

written equivalently as

To simplify notation, for all N ∈N and y ∈Rd we introduce the shift-operator SN

The following lemma uses the embeddings deﬁned above to connect the discrete and con-
tinuous continuity equations (recall CEN from Deﬁnition 3.7).
