Introduction
Superconducting quantum circuits present one of the most versatile platforms for studying
and utilizing macroscopic quantum phenomena [1–3]. Rapid development of experimental
techniques and theoretical approaches has resulted in emergence of the research field of cir-
cuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) [2–6]. The versatility of superconducting quantum
devices allows for precise control of quantum state of the system [3, 7], study of dissipative
quantum phase transitions [8–12], investigation of thermal phenomena [13–17], and devel-
opment of microwave photonic metamaterials [6, 18–21]. Application-oriented research di-
rections include microwave detectors [22–25], quantum sensing [26–28], and quantum com-
puting [2,4,29–31], of which superconducting circuits are a leading hardware platform.
The key element of a superconducting quantum device is a Josephson junction [32, 33]
which enables nonlinearity, or self-interaction, of the microwave photons in the circuit. In
theoretical cQED, Josephson junctions are typically described as nonlinear inductors with a
sinusoidal current-flux relation [3, 34]. However, it is known that the quasiparticle dynam-
ics in the Josephson junctions leads to dissipation and memory effects [35, 36] which are
not captured by this simple nonlinear inductor model. At millikelvin temperatures typical for
superconducting quantum experiments, these effects are significant only at high frequencies
above ∆Σ/(2πħh) [37], where ∆Σ is the sum of the superconducting gaps of the two leads; for
commonly used aluminum-aluminum junctions this frequency is approximately 100 GHz. At
the same time, the typical operational frequencies of the microwave field used in experiments
have the order of 10 GHz or lower, which well justifies the use of the nonlinear inductor ap-
proximation. However, even in common superconducting devices, this approximation may be
violated in the presence of a strong external microwave drive. The nonlinearity of the junc-
tion gives rise to frequency up-conversion, which may enable dissipation and memory effects
even if the drive frequency is below ∆Σ/(2πħh). Current trend of exploring higher frequency
range (> 20 GHz) [38,39] and high power drive [40,41] calls for accurate theories which can
capture effects of quasiparticles on the quantum dynamics of the microwave photons. Further-
more, theoretical and experimental study of the memory effects in a Josephson junction may
be interesting from the point of view of non-Markovian open quantum system dynamics.
In addition to the fundamental values, study of the quasiparticle-induced losses in Joseph-
son junctions gives prospects for development of tunable dissipative elements. In-situ control
of dissipation strength can be utilized for unconditional on-demand reset of the quantum state
of the system, which is one of the key operations in quantum computing [42]. Reset of su-
perconducting qubits and resonators has been demonstrated [43–47] with a quantum circuit
