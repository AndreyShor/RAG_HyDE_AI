where ⟨·, ·⟩: t∗
C × tC →C is the pairing on the complexified Lie algebra tC of a maximal torus
of the gauge group, V is the complex vector space in which the chiral scalars take values, Qi are
their gauge charges, and α > 0 are the positive roots. The parameters t = ζ −iθ are the FI-theta
parameters.
Using the parametrisation (2.5), Weff for our model is
Weff(σ) = −t(σ1 + σ2 + σ3) −3(−σ1 −σ2 −σ3)[log(−σ1 −σ2 −σ3) −1]
−3σ1[log σ1 −1] −3σ2[log σ2 −1] −3σ3[log σ3 −1].

Defining z = σ2
σ1 , w = σ3
σ2 and dividing these equations yields the constraints
z3 = w3 = 1.
(2.38)
Modulo the relations (2.38), the equations for the critical locus reduce to
e−t = −
1
(1 + z + w)3 .
(2.39)
Solving (2.38) for z and w explicitly gives nine solutions in terms of cubic roots of unity that we
can insert back into (2.39). Disregarding the locus σ1 +σ2 +σ3 = 0 for now, seven of these solutions
determine three Coulomb branch loci near the phase boundary:

Thus, there is a Coulomb branch at theta angles −π
2 , π, π
2 mod 2π. The result matches with the
Riemann symbol of the AESZ17 operator (see Table 1) up to a sign. The sign discrepancy is due
to a shift in theta angle between the GLSM and the non-linear sigma model [46] which requires us
to make the identification t = −log φ + 3πi, where φ can be interpreted as the complex structure
parameter of the mirror Calabi-Yau near the large complex structure point.
To analyse the Coulomb branch further, we take a closer look at how the three points arise as
solutions of the vacuum equations. Let α = e
