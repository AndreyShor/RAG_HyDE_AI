3.4
Stimulated emission
The evaluation of Eq. (3.32) is similar to that in Ref. [22], and it is simplified due to the Markov
approximation. Using the retarded and Keldysh propagators,
GR
p1(τ1, τ2)(2π)3δ(p1 + p2) = ia2(τ2)Θ(τ1 −τ2)[χp1(τ1), χp2(τ2)] ,
(3.34)
GK
l1 (τ1, τ2)(2π)3δ(l1 + l2) = a2(τ2) Tr [ϱ(χl2(τ2)χl1(τ1) + χl1(τ1)χl2(τ2))]χ ,
(3.35)
we find
Tr [ϱχ [TS2(τ −˜τ), TS1(τ)]] = 2i δs1s2(2π)3δ(k1 + k2)X(τ, τ −˜τ) ,
(3.36)
where we define

Since the thermal scalar field is well inside the horizon, the propagators take the Minkowski form
rescaled by the scale factor:
GR
p (τ1, τ2) = a(τ2)
a(τ1)
sin p(τ1 −τ2)

(3.39)
where fβp =

eβp−1 stands for the thermal distribution of bosonic particles, with β denoting the
inverse of the comoving temperature. Thus, the scale factor cancels out, and X becomes a function
of ˜τ:

X(˜τ) acts as a window function open for ˜τ ∼β/(2π) and vanishes for ˜τ/β ≫1, justifying the
Markov approximation. By integrating X(˜τ), we obtain

Thanks to the Markov approximation, the graviton operators reduce to a local operator product:

We have also verified that the non Markovian correction is O(β−3), which we may ignore in the
present case. Using the instantaneous operator (2.14), the field operator takes the form
