Restriction to the negative component of a DHR bimodule is the inverse of (4.2). Given a B0-
A-bimodule map h: X →Y and x ∈X−, then for every a ∈A+ we have that h(x)a = h(xa) =
h(ax) = ah(x) by Proposition 4.20. It follows again from Proposition 4.20 that h(x) ∈Y−. For
f ∈HomC(X−, Y−) and h ∈HomB0-A(X, Y ), it follows from the deﬁnition of a projective basis
that ˜f(x′) = f(x′) for x′ ∈X−and that ˜h(x) = h(x) for any x ∈X.
□
As a byproduct, we see that the category of negative half-line bimodules and the one of
positive half-line bimodules are equivalent.
Corollary 4.22. Given X ∈DHR(A•), let X+ be the A+-bimodule constructed in the same
way as X−from a basis (ηi)i localized in some F ⊂[0, ∞). Let C+ be the idempotent completion
of the category of A+-bimodules X+. The assignment
HomC−(X−, Y−) →HomC+(X+, Y+),
f 7→˜f|X+
extends to a natural isomorphism between C−and C+.
Proof. In analogy to Proposition 4.21, the morphism space HomC+(X+, Y+) is isomorphic to
HomB0-A(X, Y ). Thus, composing the corresponding isomorphisms of C−and C+ morphism
spaces the assertion follows.

Proposition 4.23. If the net A• fulﬁlls strict algebraic Haag duality, then the C∗-tensor cate-
gories C−and Cmop
+
are tensor equivalent.
Proof. The functor given by the assignment
Ω: C−→Cmop
+
,
X−7→X+,
f 7→˜f|X+
(X ∈DHR(A•))
is essentially surjective by deﬁnition, and fully faithful by Corollary 4.22, and thus, an equiva-
lence of categories. The restriction of the DHR braiding β : (X ⊠A Y )+ →Y+ ⊠A+ X+ endows
Ωwith a monoidal structure. Indeed, β obeys the corresponding hexagon axiom and is natural
for A−-bimodule maps, that is, the diagram
(X ⊠A Y )+
Y+ ⊠A+ X+
(X′ ⊠A Y ′)+
Y ′
+ ⊠A+ X′

Ω(f⊗g)

commutes for every f ∈HomC−(X−, X′
−) and g ∈HomC−(Y−, Y ′
−). In order to check this,
choose bases (ηX
l )l and (ηY
k )k of X and Y , respectively localized in F1 < F2 ⊂[0, ∞). On one
hand, we have that
Ω(g) ⊗Ω(f) ◦β(ηX
t ⊗ηY
s ) = ˜g(ηY
s ) ⊗˜f(ηX
t )
On the other hand, Ω(f ⊗g) is explicitly given by
Ω(f ⊗g)(ηX
t ⊗ηY
s ) =
X
i,j
f(ξX
i ) ⊗g(ξY
j ) ⟨ξY
j | ⟨ξX
i |ηX
t ⟩ηY
s ⟩.
Now, ηY
s is localized to the right of ηX
t
and thus
⟨ξY
j | ⟨ξX
i |ηX
t ⟩ηY
s ⟩= ⟨ξY
j |ηY
s ⟩⟨ξX
i |ηX
t ⟩,
which in turn leads to
Ω(f ⊗g)(ηX
t ⊗ηY
s ) =
X
i
f(ξX
i ) ⊗˜g(ηY
s ) ⟨ξX
i |ηX
t ⟩.
Now, by writing Ω(f ⊗g) in terms of the basis (ηX
k ⊗ηY
l )l,k, we obtain that
β ◦Ω(f ⊗g)(ηX
t ⊗ηY
s ) =
X
i
X
l,k
ηY

k ⟨ηY
l | ⟨ηX
k |f(ξX

s )⟩⟨ξX
i |ηX
t ⟩.
