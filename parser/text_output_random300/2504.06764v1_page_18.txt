Figure 3 | Current-induced switching of Néel vector in Pt/FCGT. (a) Schematics 
illustrating SOT 180° switching of the Néel vector in Pt/FCGT with odd-number vdW 
layers. The directions of applied current Iy, spin polarization σ, in-plane magnetic field Hy, 
Néel vector n and net magnetic moment δm are indicated. (b) AHE hysteresis loop of Rxy 
driven by out-of-plane magnetic fields Hz. (c) Current-induced AHE hysteresis loops with 
in-plane magnetic fields of ±1 kOe. The dashed lines in (b) and (c) indicate the magnitude 
of δRH, showing the nearly full switching of Néel vector. (d and e) Temperature-dependent 
current-induced AHE hysteresis loops with the in-plane magnetic fields of 1 kOe (d) and 
–1 kOe (e). (f) Switching current as a function of in-plane magnetic fields at 180 K and 
150 K. (g) Robust 180° switching of Néel vector with alternating currents with in-plane 
magnetic fields of 1 kOe at 150 K. Top panel: Sequence of alternating currents; bottom 
panel: corresponding measured AHE resistance indicating the direction Néel vector.
