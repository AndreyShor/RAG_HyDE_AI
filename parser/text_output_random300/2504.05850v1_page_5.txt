GRAPHICAL FUNCTIONS WITH SPIN
5
Proof. We consider {1, . . . , |α|} as the vertices of a graph Γ and every pair in π ∈Πα
0 as an edge in Γ. Then
Γ has |α|/2 disconnected edges (Γ is a 1-regular graph). For π1, π2 ∈Πα
0 , the graph π1 ∪π2 is a 2-regular
graph. Any such graph is a collection of L(π1, π2) loops. By contraction of indices, ⟨π1, π2⟩0 = DL(π1,π2).
In particular, ⟨π, π⟩0 = D|α|/2 whereas for any π1 ̸= π2 we obtain that ⟨π1, π2⟩0 = Dn with n < |α|/2.
Therefore, det⟨π1, π2⟩0 has unit leading coefficient as a polynomial in D. In particular, det(⟨π1, π2⟩0) ̸= 0
and ⟨·, ·⟩0 is nondegenerate.
□
If one (artificially) divides the |α| vertices of the graph Γ in the above proof into |α|/2 upper vertices
and |α|/2 lower vertices, one obtains an element in the Brauer algebra [13]. The scalar product (20)
is the trace in the Brauer algebra. For generic parameter D, Brauer algebras have been shown to be
semi-simple. Brauer algebras belong to the class of cellular algebras.
By Lemma 4, every partition π ∈Πα
0 has a dual ˆπ = ˆπ(α) in the vector space of formal sums of
partitions with coefficients in the field of rational functions in D,
(21)
⟨πi, ˆπj⟩0 = δi,j,
πi ∈Πα
0 , ˆπj ∈⟨Πα
0 ⟩Q(D).
By linearity, we extend ˆπ to gˆπ yielding
(22)
gπigˆπj = δi,j.
From (18) we hence obtain
(23)
PG,π = P α
Ggˆπ(α),
for π ∈Πα
0 .
Example 5. For |α| = 2 we write 12 for the pair α1, α2 and get Πα
0 = {{12}}. The dual of {12} is
1
D{12}. Hence
PG,{12} = P α1,α2
G
gα1,α2
D
.
For |α| = 4 we have Πα
0 = {{12, 34}, {13, 24}, {14, 23}} = {π1, π2, π3}. A short calculation gives
ˆπ1 = (D + 1)π1 −π2 −π3
(D −1)D(D + 2)
with cyclic results for ˆπ2 and ˆπ3. Hence
PG,{12,34} = P α1,α2,α3,α4
G
((D + 1)gα1,α2gα3,α4 −gα1,α3gα2,α4 −gα1,α4gα2,α3)
(D −1)D(D + 2)
,
with cyclic results for PG,{13,24} and PG,{14,23}.
Results up to spin |α| = 10 are in the Maple package HyperlogProcedures [23].
For fixed G, we lift duality from partitions to formal sums of (spin zero) graphs in the graph algebra
with coefficients in Q(D).
For π ∈Πα
0 we denote the lift of ˆπ = P
i ciπi (ci ∈Q(D)) by Gˆπ, i.e.
Gˆπ = P
i ciGgπi. We define the period of Gˆπ as
(24)
PGˆπ =

Ggπi(α) = P α

where in the last equation we used (23). With (18) we get

Hence, spin |α| periods can be expressed as sums of scalar periods.
Example 6. From Example 5 we obtain

G \
{12,34} = (D + 1)G(α)gα1,α2gα3,α4 −G(α)gα1,α3gα2,α4 −G(α)gα1,α4gα2,α3
(D −1)D(D + 2)
,
where G(α) indicates that the graph G depends on the spin indices α. On the right-hand sides all spin
indices are contracted, so that the graphs are scalar.
