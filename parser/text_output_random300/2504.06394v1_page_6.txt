The negative sign in the last equation ensures that the orthonormal basis vectors {e𝑟, e𝜃, e𝑠}
follow the right hand rule. We can now rewrite the Navier-Stokes equations (2.1) in component
form. Writing the velocity vector as ˆu = ˆ𝑢e𝑟+ ˆ𝑣e𝜃+ ˆ𝑤e𝑠, the continuity equation becomes

Noting that the cupula is approximately thin (with an aspect ratio of around 0.25), we model
it as a circular plate. We locate the cupula at arc length position ˆ𝑠= 0, and define its deflection
by the function ˆ𝜂(ˆ𝑟, 𝜃, ˆ𝑡). As indicated above, our numerical simulations have shown that the
deformation of the cupula is small compared to the tube radius, suggesting that strains are
small and suggesting it is sufficient to use a linear equation. This small strain assumption
will be confirmed in Section 2.4 through a scaling argument. Motivated by this linearity and
the relatively slender geometry of the cupula, we further assume that the cupular deflection
satisfies the linear plate equation, which in the rotating frame reads (see Howell et al. 2008)

where 𝐵= 𝐸𝑡3
ℎ/[12(1 −𝜈2
𝑠)] is the plate’s bending stiffness and 𝑇is the applied tension in
the plate (which we assume is uniform and constant since deflections remain small compared
to 𝑡ℎ). In this regime, the forcing for the cupular displacement is given by the pressure jump
across the two sides of the cupula.
We require boundary conditions for both the fluid problem (2.5) and the elastic prob-
lem (2.6). The walls of the endolymph are assumed to have a no-slip condition, so that in
