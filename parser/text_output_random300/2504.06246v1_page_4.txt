FIG. 2.
(a) Local tunneling conductance measured at the bottom probe as a function of VB and IDC at B∥= 100 mT. The
region between two white dashed lines indicates the AC Josephson regime. As a guide to the eye, the four peaks are highlighted
by red and light blue dotted lines, and the centerpoints of these pairs are highlighted by blue (red) dashed lines. Light blue
(red) lines track P1 and P3 (P2 and P4). The centerpoints of these pairs of peaks are expected to be at VB ≈0 (VB ≈VJ) in
the AC Josephson regime. Red and blue open circles mark the positions used to calculate ∆V , as indicated with the light brown
arrow, and ∆Vpair1(pair 2), as labeled with blue (red) arrows and plotted in (c) and (d). (b) The I-V data at B∥= 100 mT
is displayed. The DC and AC Josephson effect regimes are delineated by black dashed lines. (c) Brown dots represent the
voltage difference between the centers of two pairs of conductance peaks, ∆V . The black dashed line indicates I-V data. (d)
Red (blue) dots show ∆Vpair 1(pair 2) extracted from the pair of conductance peaks centering at VB ≈0 (VB ≈VJ). Panels (c)
and (d) share the same x-axis.
apparent that ∆V tracks VJ in the studied IDC range.
Another quantity extracted from the data in Fig. 2(a)
is the voltage difference between the two conductance
peaks for each pair, which we defined as:
∆Vpair 1 = V3 −V1

∆Vpair 2 = V4 −V2

∆Vpair 1(pair 2) defines two apparent spectral gaps.
In
Fig. 2(d), ∆Vpair 1(pair 2) are plotted as a function of IDC
with blue and red points, respectively. In the studied IDC
range, both ∆Vpair 1 and ∆Vpair 2 follow a similar trend
as a function of IDC: ∆Vpair 1(pair 2) decreases from ap-
proximately 210 µV at IDC = 0.6 µA to 120 µ V at
IDC = 1.3 µA. As IDC increases, the proximity-induced
superconducting gap decreases.
Although multiple spectra gaps in the regime 0 <
eVJ < 2∆Al are expected from Floquet hybridization,
we first consider a simpler mechanism. Given that the
Josephson junction under study is in the short and bal-
listic regime, we consider a coupling mechanism in which
the normal tunnel probe is directly coupled to the two
superconducting (SC) leads positioned less than a super-
conducting coherence length away from the tunnel probe.
In this scenario, tunneling spectroscopy probes the den-
sity of states of the region consisting of the bare InAs and
two Al-covered InAs regions, which form the two SC leads
of the Josephson junction. This strong coupling mecha-
nism can be taken into account in a 3-terminal model,
as shown in Fig. 3(a). We consider a normal (N) lead at
voltage VB connected to two superconductors: one super-
conductor (SC1) at voltage VJ, and the other lead (SC2)
is grounded. When an electron tunnels into the junction,
before changing its energy, it can enter either of the two
SC leads if there are available states, as indicated by the
orange arrow in Fig. 3(a).
We may express the differential conductance dIN/dVB
as two contributions from N to SC1 and SC2. Each of
the NS interfaces is described by a low-temperature tun-
neling conductance dINS/dV ∝NBCS(e|V |) [18], where
NBCS(e|V |) is the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS)
