at different Vg following the sequence of applied Vg in our experiment. The range of the 
applied Vg is between -60 V and 80 V. The optical near-field response between the two 
adjacent polar states (polarization directions indicated by triangles in (a)) becomes 
almost identical at around Vg = 40 V (e), indicating hole doping in the sample at Vg = 0 
V. This means that the sample is slightly hole-doped at Vg = 0 V, which prevent our 
tetralayer from being electron-doped. s, Optical contrast between the two adjacent polar 
stackings, as a function of Vg. The extracted optical contrast from Vg = 0 V to positive 
maximum Vg is denoted by red dots and those measured from positive maximum Vg to 
negative maximum Vg are denoted by the blues dots. The charge neutrality point 
roughly lies at = 40 V (indicated by the gray dashed lines), which can also be inferred 
from the vanishing amplitude of the plasmon fringes reflected by the domain wall. The 
yellow shaded area marks the carrier density from electron doping density of 
3.12 × 1012𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐−2  to hole doping density of 4.68 × 1012𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐−2 , where the optical
