and the near-field structures, while the remaining modes predominantly capture noise or
uncorrelated events. These higher-order modes contain small-scale flow structures that
are difficult to predict accurately.
Also, the number of snapshots retained in the snapshot matrix significantly influences
the noise content in the POD modes. Increasing the number of snapshots leads to more
noise accumulation in modes 3, 4, and 5, making it harder for the method to extract
clean, coherent structures. This accumulation suggests that for large datasets, applying
HOSVD instead of SVD may provide better noise filtering and improved mode separation.
The evolution of the first ten POD mode coefficients from the turbulent experimental
cylinder dataset has been plotted below in Figure A6. 500 snapshots were used to create
the snapshot matrix. The trend followed by the temporal coefficients is in good agreement
with the previous description. In modes 2 and 3, it is possible to identify a periodic
behavior. The complexity of these temporal patterns increases for the remaining modes.
For modes higher than 6, the noise component becomes very strong.

Key Considerations for Developing Deep Learning Models
While some information has already been provided earlier in the paper, this section
provides a detailed discussion of the key considerations for developing a deep learning
(DL) model.
A.3.1
Data Management
Beyond dividing data into training, validation, and test sets, other critical factors must
also be considered. The other main points of focus while designing these sets should be
the following:
â€¢ Consistency Across Dev and Test Sets: It should be ensured that the dev
