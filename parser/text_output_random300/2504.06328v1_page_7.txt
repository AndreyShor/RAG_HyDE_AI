agonalizable as classical probability distributions),
the FS/Bures metric reduces to the classical Fisher
metric. Conversely, the Bures metric (defined on
the space of density matrices) is a full quantum
generalization of the Fisher metric and, when re-
stricted to pure states, is identical to the Fubini
-Study metric. By construction, the Bures distance
between two density operators ρ and σ is given by
DB(ρ, σ) =

which for pure states ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, σ = |ϕ⟩⟨ϕ|
simplifies to DB(|ψ⟩, |ϕ⟩) =
p
2(1 −|⟨ψ|ϕ⟩|).
In-
finitesimally, DB induces the Riemannian metric
gB
µν on state space. The quantum Fisher infor-
mation (QFI) matrix Jµν is closely related, being
defined as Jµν = Tr[ρ LµLν+LνLµ
2
], where Lµ are
the symmetric logarithmic derivative operators for
parameter θµ. Importantly, Jµν is proportional to
the Bures metric: one can show Jµν = 4 gB
µν. In
the pure-state case, this yields the useful relation
that the QFI is four times the Fubini -Study met-
ric tensor. Intuitively, the quantum Fisher infor-
mation quantifies the statistical distinguishability
of infinitesimally close quantum states (under opti-
mal quantum measurement), analogous to how the
Fisher information does for classical probability dis-
tributions; a larger QFI (or FS metric) means the
state |ψ(θ)⟩changes more rapidly in Hilbert space
with a change in parameters θ, indicating greater
model expressivity or sensitivity.
These geometric tools formalize how quantum
state space is a curved manifold richer than its
classical counterpart.
For a classical N-outcome
probability distribution (mixed state diagonal in a
fixed basis), the space of probabilities is a simplex
of dimension N −1, which when equipped with
the Fisher metric has constant curvature but rel-
atively simpler topology (essentially, it is isometric
to a portion of an N-sphere in many cases).
By
contrast, the manifold of quantum states (even re-
stricting to pure states of an N-dimensional sys-
tem) is the complex projective space CPN−1, a
K¨ahler manifold with nonzero holomorphic curva-
ture.
In concrete terms, a single qubit (N = 2)
has state space CP1, topologically a 2-sphere (the
Bloch sphere) of constant positive curvature.
A
classical bit, on the other hand, has only two pure
states (0 or 1) and a one-dimensional continuum
of probabilistic mixtures between them; effectively
a line interval (with Fisher metric having infinite
curvature at the ends).
Thus, even at the level
of a single bit/qubit, the quantum state space is
a superset: the Bloch sphere contains the classical
probability line as a geodesic segment (the diago-
nal mixed states), but also includes an equatorial
circumference of genuinely quantum superposition
states with no classical analog. The distance be-
tween two non-orthogonal qubit states on the Bloch
sphere (given by the FS angle or Bures distance) re-
flects a quantum notion of similarity that reduces
to classical Hellinger distance when states are diag-
onal, but in general accounts for phase and ampli-
tude differences that classical metrics cannot cap-
ture.
3.2. Superposition
and
Entanglement:
Beyond
Classical Manifolds
Two hallmark quantum phenomena, superposi-
tion and entanglement, endow the state space
with an expressive structure far beyond that of
classical geometric manifolds.
Superposition im-
plies that a quantum system can exist in a coher-
ent linear combination of basis states, rather than
just probabilistic mixtures.
Geometrically, a su-
perposition |ψ⟩= α|0⟩+ β|1⟩(for a qubit) is a
distinct point on the Bloch sphere that is not on
the line connecting |0⟩and |1⟩(which would cor-
respond to their classical mixture). Instead, such
a state lies on the surface of the sphere, at a fi-
nite Fubini -Study distance from any classical basis
state. The ability to form superpositions leads to
interference phenomena: if we move along a path
in state space that loops around, the final state
can exhibit a phase (a geometric Berry phase) that
has no counterpart in classical probability theory.
In differential-geometric terms, the quantum state
space carries not only a Riemannian metric (FS)
but also a symplectic structure (associated with the
imaginary part of the quantum geometric tensor),
reflecting the presence of phase as an extra degree
of freedom. This additional structure (encapsulated
in the quantum geometric tensor’s Berry curvature)
means that the space of quantum states is ‘twisted’
in a way classical manifolds of probability distribu-
tions are not. No classical machine learning model
defined on a simple Euclidean or Riemannian mani-
fold of features can reproduce this effect of quantum
phase interference without effectively simulating a
higher-dimensional complex representation.
Entanglement further amplifies the divergence
between quantum and classical geometries.
