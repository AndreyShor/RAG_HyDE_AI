while a blue-detuned one (∆> 0) will induce attractive
photon-photon interaction (self-focusing).
However, at
room temperature and above, Doppler broadening plays
an important role. At room temperature (∼300 K), the
Doppler-broadened linewidth for rubidium is about 500
MHz. This broadening determines the range of detunings
where nonlinear effects are accessible while keeping ab-
sorption low. In practice, detunings in the range of 1–10
GHz from resonance provide a good compromise between
nonlinearity and transmission. A detuning too close to
resonance (|∆| < 2π · 1 GHz) leads to excessive absorp-
tion, limiting the effective propagation length, while a
detuning too far from resonance (|∆| > 2π · 10 GHz)
reduces the nonlinear response significantly (McCormick
et al., 2004).
When setting up a fluid of light experiment in a
rubidium vapor, a careful vapor cell design has to be
taken into account.
Standard glass cells can be used,
but for high-temperature operation (> 100◦C), quartz
cells with 2-sided-coated windows with optical contact
are preferable. A well designed oven is also required to
ensure an homogeneous temperature to avoid rubidium
deposition on the windows and air current convection
outside of the cell that would distort the imaging system.
Among alkali vapors, rubidium (Rb) is widely used
due to its convenient spectral properties and strong op-
tical nonlinearities. Both isotopes, 87Rb and 85Rb, have
well-characterized D1 and D2 transitions and exhibit rel-
atively high vapor pressures at moderate temperatures,
making them accessible for room-temperature experi-
ments. For fluids of light experiments, rubidium offers
many advantages. The transition dipole moment of ru-
bidium (µge) is relatively large compared to heavier al-
kali, leading to a stronger χ(3) response compared to ce-
sium. Moreover, rubidium is chemically stable in stan-
dard sealed cells, unlike potassium or lithium, which re-
quire specialized handling due to their higher reactivity.
While sodium and cesium have also been considered for
fluids of light and nonlinear optics, their absorption and
vapor pressure characteristics often make them less prac-
tical. The lower vapor pressure of sodium requires higher
temperatures to reach the same optical depth as rubid-
ium, whereas cesium’s hyperfine structure complicates its
resonance structure for single-laser experiments.
B. Photorefractive crystals
Photorefractive crystals are historically the first plat-
forms for studying fluid-like optical behavior thanks to
their strong nonlinear response to optical fields.
Un-
like atomic vapors, where nonlinearity arises from res-
onant interactions with discrete atomic transitions, pho-
torefractive crystals rely on charge transport mechanisms
to induce a dynamic refractive index modulation. This

fundamental difference affects their experimental acces-
sibility, control parameters, and practical limitations.
The photorefractive effect is based on the redistribu-
tion of charge carriers in response to an incident optical
field. When a laser beam illuminates the crystal, charge
carriers (electrons or holes) are excited from donor states
into the conduction band. These mobile carriers then mi-
grate due to diffusion and drift effects, the latter being
enhanced by an externally applied electric field. Even-
tually, the carriers become trapped in spatially displaced
locations, leading to the formation of a space-charge field.
This field modulates the refractive index of the material
via the linear electro-optic (Pockels) effect, creating an
intensity-dependent change in refractive index:
∆n(I) = −1
2n3
0r33Esc(I),
(83)
where n0 is the linear refractive index of the bulk crystal,
r33 is the electro-optic coefficient, and Esc(I) is the space-
charge electric field, which depends on the local intensity
I. In a biased photorefractive crystal with an external
electric field Eext applied along the c-axis of the crystal
where the nonlinear effects are the strongest (Lukasiewicz
et al., 2008), the space-charge field can be expressed in
terms of an electrostatic potential ϕ (Kukhtarev et al.,
1978).
The total potential consists of a light-induced
electric potential ϕ0 and an external bias term −|Eext|x,
assuming that the c-axis is aligned with the propagation
axis z (Barsi and Fleischer, 2015; Boughdad et al., 2019).
This results in an anisotropic description of the photore-
fractive effect, where the space-charge field is given by:
Esc = Eext −∇ϕ0.
(84)
The term Esc −Eext = −∇ϕ0 is referred to as the screen-
ing field, which is generated by the redistribution of
charge carriers due to light excitation.
Under steady-
state conditions, where the photovoltaic effect is negligi-
ble and the drift effect dominates over diffusion in charge
