This section presents the statistical analysis of the first and last experiments, conducted using RStudio software.
Figures 21 and 22 provide an overall comparison. Figures 22a, 21b and 21c illustrate the variation in training
error, 𝐿2 error and relative 𝐿2 error, respectively, across different neuron counts (12, 16, 20 and 24) over multiple
LBFGS iterations (500, 1000 and 5000). Outliers are highlighted with red circles in the 𝐿2 and relative 𝐿2 error
plots. Additionally, Figure 21d presents a bar plot comparing the 𝐿2 and relative 𝐿2 errors for the best-performing
configuration, corresponding to the maximum LBFGS iterations (5000). These visualizations provide insights into
training behavior, error convergence, and the impact of hyperparameter selection. Similarly, Figures 22a, 22b
and 22c depict the variation in training error, 𝐿2 error and relative 𝐿2 error for the last experiment, considering
neuron counts of 16, 20, 24 and 28 over the same LBFGS iterations. Outliers are again highlighted with red
circles in the 𝐿2 and relative 𝐿2 error plots. Figure 22d presents a bar plot comparing the 𝐿2 and relative 𝐿2
errors for the best-performing configuration at 5000 LBFGS iterations. These visualizations facilitate the analysis
of training behavior, error convergence, and the influence of hyperparameter selection across experiments. The
analysis highlights how the number of neurons affects different error types. Increasing the LBFGS iterations leads
to error reduction. Notably, an outlier in the relative error E𝑟
𝐺is observed at 500 LBFGS iterations for different
neuron counts.
