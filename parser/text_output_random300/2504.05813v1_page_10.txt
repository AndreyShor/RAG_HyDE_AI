values of β and fixing µ = 1.0
R′(rm) = 0 ⇒1 + rmζ′(rm) = 0, from which we find µc,II = e/(2β). The case µ = µc,II
corresponds to the marginal case with a single point rII where R′(rII) = 0, which results
in a compaction function with C′′(rm) = 0. Plots for the different initial conditions can be
found in Fig.1. It can be seen that the type-II configuration, with two characteristic peaks
in the compaction function, appears when the amplitude µ exceeds the critical value µc,II.
For the purpose of study the dynamics of the fluctuations, we define two reference
quantities: the time of horizon crossing tH when the fluctuation reenters the cosmological
horizon neglecting the curvature perturbation ζ5 and the mass of the cosmological horizon

On the other side, to identify trapped surfaces and characterize the trapping horizons
of type A/B PBH configurations introduced in [41] following the nomenclature of [68, 69],
we consider the expansion Θ± ≡hµν∇µk±
ν of null geodesic congruences k±
µ orthogonal to a
spherical surface Σ. Here hµν is the metric induced on Σ. There are two such congruences,
which we may call inward and outward-directed, with components k±
µ = (−A, ±B, 0, 0), such
that k+ · k−= −2.
Surfaces Σ with Θ−< 0, while Θ+ > 0 are called “untrapped” with corresponds to a
flat spacetime. If both expansions are negative, the surface is called “trapped”, while if both
are positive, the surface is “anti-trapped”. In terms of the Misner-Sharp variables (see for
instance [70, 71]), we have
Θ± = 2
R(U ± Γ).
(3.17)
In a spherically symmetric spacetime, any point in the (r, t) plane can be thought of as
a closed surface Σ with proper radius R(r, t). Trapping horizons at the point r∗then satisfy
Θ+Θ−= 0, which, using the constraint Eq.(2.5) and Eq.(3.17), gives 2M(r∗, t) = R(r∗, t).
The trapping horizons can then be either inner (L−Θ+ > 0), outer (L−Θ+ < 0) or degenerate
5The horizon crossing time defined here is not the true one, which should be obtained through the numerical
simulation to account for the full non-linear evolution of the fluctuation. However, for simplicity, we define a
time-scale tH, neglecting the effects of the fluctuation ζ on the FLRW background and its dynamics.
