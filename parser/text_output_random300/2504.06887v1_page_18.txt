Figure 5: The above figures show the numerical plots of the partial derivative of the transition probability with respect
to the KMS temperature as a function of the proper distance from the event horizon on a constant Painleve-Gullstrand
time slice (x-axis) while keeping the distance between the two detectors and all other parameters fixed. In the plots,
the black line represents the Unruh state and the red line represents the Hartle-Hawking-Israel (HHI) state. The top
panels display the results for the 2-bein co-moving with the detector, while the bottom panels show the results for the
2-bein preserving conformal symmetry in the coupling. The UDW in left panels plots is static while freely falling in
right panels.
the plots obtained using the saddle point approximations in (69)-(72) and numerical results to be consistent with each
other. It can be observed from the first plot of Fig. 5 that the derivative of transition probability for a static detector,
coupled with two point functions W HHI
ψ,s defined in (22) and W Unruh
ψ,s
defined in (30), becomes increasingly negative as one
approaches the event horizon. Therefore, the weak anti-Hawking effect for a static detector becomes more prominent as
one approaches the event horizon [42; 83]. However, for a freely falling detector (with the two-point functions W HHI
ψ,f and
W Unruh
ψ,f
defined in (24) and (32)), the top right plot shows that the anti-Hawking is dominant far from the horizon for HHI
and Unruh states. In contrast, the bottom left plot of Fig. 5 shows that a static detector with interaction Hamiltonian
corresponding to conformal symmetry preserving two-point function W HHI
ψ,c
defined in(18) and W Unruh
ψ,c
defined in (26),
for the range of parameter space considered throughout the paper, does not encounter any anti-Hawking effect. This
property remains valid for a freely falling detector in HHI and Unruh states with W HHI
ψ,c
and W Unruh
ψ,c
respectively.

Entanglement harvesting using UDW
We discussed above the transition rate and the anti-Hawking effects experienced by the UDW detector. In this section,
we introduce the entanglement measure, put two such detectors along a given trajectory, and perform the entanglement
