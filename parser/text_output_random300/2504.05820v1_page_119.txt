Figure 4.1: The aN3LO non-singlet splitting functions (1 −x)Pns,+(x, αs) and (1 −x)Pns,−(x, αs),
evaluated as a function of x for nf = 4 and αs = 0.2 in our approximation compared to the previous
approximation of Ref. [292] (denoted FHMRUVV), for which the approximation uncertainty, as estimated
by its authors, is also displayed. For comparison, the (exact) NNLO result is also shown.
ℓ= 6, 7) and sub-subleading poles (1/(N + 2) or 1/(N + 3), ℓ= 8). The last element, ℓ= 8, is
chosen at a fixed distance from the lowest known moment, N = 2 for γ(3)
ns,+(N) and N = 1 for
γ(3)
ns,−(N).
In Fig. 4.1 we plot the resulting splitting functions P (3)
ns,±(x), obtained by Mellin inversion of the
anomalous dimension. We compare our approximation to the approximation of Ref. [292], for
αs = 0.2 and nf = 4, and also show the (exact) NNLO result for reference. Because the splitting
function is a distribution at x = 1 we plot (1 −x)P(x). The result of Ref. [292] also provides
an estimate of the uncertainty related to the approximation, shown in the figure as a band,
and we observe that this uncertainty is negligible except at very small x. As we include further
constraints on the small-x behavior, the uncertainty on the approximation becomes negligible,
as it can be checked by comparing results obtained by including increasingly more information
in the construction of the approximation. Consequently, as mentioned in Section 4.1.1 above,
we take nH = 0 in Eq. (4.4).
4.1.4. The singlet sector
In order to determine the singlet-sector anomalous dimension matrix, we must determine γqq,ps
that, together with the previously determined non-singlet anomalous dimension, contributes to
the qq entry, and then also the three remaining matrix elements γqg, γgq, and γgg.
For all matrix elements, the leading large-nf O(n3
f) contributions in Eq. (4.2) are known
analytically [291], while for γqq,ps [307] and γgq [301] the O(n2
f) contributions are also known
and we include all of them in γ(3)
ij,nf (N).

this means that on top of order 2n −k + 1 subleading poles in N = 0, there are also leading
