SINGULARITY AND REGULARITY OF THE CRITICAL 2D SHF

in the quasi-critical regime (1.22) (see Section 3). This strategy is actually very general and
leads us to formulate the following “meta-theorem”.
Metatheorem 1.15. Consider any “reasonable” statement about the SHF Z ϑ
t pdxq in the
regime ϑ Ñ ´8. Such a statement holds if one can prove the corresponding statement for
the rescaled directed polymer partition functions Zβ
tNprrx

N
in the
quasi-critical regime (1.22), for any sequence |ϑN| Ñ 8 slowly enough.
By “reasonable” statement we mean some property of locally finite measures on R2 which
is continuous with respect to the vague topology or the topology of C´ε. Indeed, the basic idea
behind Claim 1.15 is that the convergence in distribution (1.20) or (1.21), which we know
to hold in the critical regime, can also be applied to ϑ “ ϑN Ñ ´8 slowly enough, allowing
us to effectively transfer the statement from directed polymers to the SHF. To lighten the
exposition, we refrain from formulating a more precise result: we rather refer to the proof of
Theorem 1.2 in Section 3 for a concrete application of this idea.
For example, the quasi-critical regime (1.22) was recently investigated in [CCR23] for
diffusive initial conditions, such as UBp0,δ
?
Nq for fixed δ ą 0. It was shown that the averaged
partition function concentrates around its mean:

its variance vanishes at rate |ϑN|´1 [CCR23, Proposition 2.1], and Gaussian fluctuations
emerge at the corresponding scale [CCR23, Theorem 1.1]:

From this one can deduce a corresponding results for the SHF in the weak disorder limit
ϑ Ñ ´8, see [CCR23, Theorem 1.2], in the spirit of the metatheorem just stated:

(1.35)
Remark 1.16. We expect Z ϑ
t pUBpx,δqq to have Gaussian fluctuations, as ϑ Ñ ´8, on all
spatial scales δ “ Op1q satisfying δ “ e´op|ϑ|q, i.e. much larger than the scales δϱ
ϑ on which
log-normality arises in Theorem 1.2. Similarly, we expect the averaged partition function
in (1.34) to have a Gaussian limit when averaged on spatial scales δ
?
N with δN “ Op1q
satisfying δ “ e´op|ϑN|q, i.e. much larger than the scale δϱ
N appearing in Theorem 1.8.
We note that in the subcritical regime (1.26), Gaussian fluctuations for spatial averages on
such mesoscopic spatial scales have been established for the solution of the 2D KPZ equation
in [Tao24] (the subcritical 2D SHE and polymer partition functions are expected to have the
same fluctuations on the mesoscopic scale).
2. Basic tools
In this section we collect some basic definitions and tools that we use in the proof. In
particular, we present some key second moment computations on the partition function in
the quasi-critical regime (1.22). For simplicity, we will abbreviate βquasi-crit
N
by βN.
