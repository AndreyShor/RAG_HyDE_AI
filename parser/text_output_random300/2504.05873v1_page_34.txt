detect charged and neutral hadrons. The three HCALs have a combined length of approx-
imately 5 m, and a width of 60 cm × 60 cm. Using this setup, the calorimeters are able to
determine the energy deposited inside the beam dump. If an ALP or other weakly inter-
acting particle were to be produced inside the dump and was long-lived enough, it would
escape the detector and carry away a fraction of the original energy of the beam. This
missing energy can be measured and registered as an event [46].
The main beam has an energy of 100 GeV. The energy cutoff for the detector is set
at 50 GeV. In the runs from 2016–2022, NA64 had a total of Ne = 9.37 · 1011 EOT. In
the 2016 run, a fourth HCAL was placed in line with the other three HCALs, which was
moved downstream to be a zero-degree HCAL to help with background detection in later
runs. A detailed description of the layout of the experiment can be found in ref. [101]. No
candidate events were observed [102].
Visible mode
The setup used for the visible mode is described in ref. [47]. The beam is directed toward
an electromagnetic calorimeter composed of tungsten and scintillator plates (WCAL). The
WCAL serves as an active beam dump, with the first layers being the main regions in
which BSM particles would be produced. The rest of the WCAL serves as a dump for
the SM particles created in other processes, while weakly interacting particles would pass
through the dump. After a decay length of approximately 3.5 m, the WCAL is followed by
the ECAL and HCALs discussed above. If an ALP or any other particle was produced and
subsequently decayed inside the decay volume, the ECAL would register the energy of the
decay products. If the energy that is deposited in the ECAL is the same as the missing
energy in the WCAL, i.e. EECAL = Ebeam −EWCAL, then this is a candidate event [103].
In 2017, the beam was run at an energy of 100 GeV. The length of the WCAL was
varied from 290 mm, with 2.4 · 1010 EOT, to 220 mm, with 3 · 1010 EOT. The cutoff energy
for the detector was set to 20 GeV. In 2018, the beam energy was increased to 150 GeV,
with 3 · 1010 EOT, with the cutoff energy being set to 30 GeV. No candidate events were
observed [47, 103].
Muon mode
The experimental setup for NA64µ is illustrated in ref. [49]. As with the original NA64 run
with an electron beam, the experiment is built to detect the invisible decay of BSM particles
by measuring the missing energy of an event. A muon beam with an energy of 160 GeV is
directed at an ECAL, similar to the one in previous runs. The ECAL has a total length
of 49 cm. Further downstream, a magnetic spectrometer is placed, which uses a bending
magnet (MS2) to deflect the muon beam, as well as two HCALs to remove residuals from
the upstream detectors [49]. The muon momentum can then be reconstructed. Candidate
events are defined as events in which the reconstructed muon momentum is smaller than
80 GeV and the energy deposition in the calorimeters is compatible with a minimum ionising
particle, such that the missing energy is larger than 80 GeV. This setup results in a shielding
of approximately 11 m, which the ALP must traverse before decaying. After the 2021 test
