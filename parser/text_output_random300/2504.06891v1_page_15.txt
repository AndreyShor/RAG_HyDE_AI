OPAL, OPLIB, OPAS and OP tables, in line with the experimental results40;42. Comparing our
values to detailed opacity computations in the exact same solar conditions, we Ô¨Ånd differences
of up to 40% between the SCO-RCG code and the OPAS and OP codes, as well as disagree-
ments with helioseismic values. We demonstrate the power of helioseismology in using the
Sun as a fundamental physics experiment, as was done for the equation of state in the past61;62,
tightly constraining here the behaviour of radiative opacities, a key ingredient of stellar models
and a major source of uncertainty. The differences between the various theoretical opacities we
observe somewhat recall the issues found for Cepheids in 1980s and we conclude with a plea
similar to that of Simon (1982) and Andreasen & Petersen (1988)43;44 and of recent asteroseis-
mic studies of massive stars49;46. The need for new computations of detailed opacity tables and
analyses of the treatment of physical processes and numerical techniques demonstrate the key
role of helio- and asteroseismology to guide these works. We show that opacities constitute a
major contributor to the solar and stellar modelling problem. Full evolutionary computations
with SCO-RCG and OPAS tables will impact the way we see the Sun and stars in the Universe
as well as stellar populations accross cosmic times.
