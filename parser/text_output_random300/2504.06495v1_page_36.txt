Continuous-time process with endogenous barrier
Let’s now consider the model with endogenous threshold, which we again formulate in con-
tinuous time and in close analogy to (17) above. For constants eµ ∈R, σ > 0, and ε ∈(0, 1),
we consider the process10

where again Wτ is a standard Brownian motion. The goal of this subsection is to demon-
strate that the process in (28) leads to a long-term behavior of the endogenous threshold,
ε E [Φτ | Φτ > 0], that is equivalent to our previous exogenous threshold ǫ ατ with parameter
α such that we obtain β = 1 for small ε. The following theorem formalizes that result.
Theorem 5 Consider the continuous-time process Φτ deﬁned in (28) with parameters eµ ∈R,
σ > 0 and ε ∈(0, 1). Assume that at time τ = 0 the process starts at a non-random initial
value Φ0 = φ0 > 0, let ξτ := ε E[Φτ | Φτ > 0] be the value of the threshold implied by the
time-evolution of the process, and let c0 := φ0 ε/(1 −ε) and α := exp

. Then, we
have:

= log α.
We previously introduced ξτ and α diﬀerently, but within the endogenous threshold model
here, we now deﬁne them as in Theorem 5, in terms of this process and its parameters. The
proof is provided in the appendix, but given the discussion in the previous subsection, the
result is unsurprising: In the long run, the threshold follows
ξτ ≈c0 ατ,
10For the results in this section, the sign of eµ is inconsequential. In fact, through rescaling, we could
normalize the process to satisfy eµ = 0 and σ = 1 without any loss of generality from a purely mathematical
perspective. However, in the context of a physical branching process, as described in Sections 3 and 4, we
have eµ > 0, meaning that the process log Φτ exhibits a negative drift.
