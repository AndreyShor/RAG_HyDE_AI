Non Nucleonic Components in Short Nuclear Distances

The unusual feature of our result is that the 𝑃-wave is “incomplete", that is it contributes only
for 𝜆𝑑= ±1 polarizations of the deuteron.

𝑘2𝑑𝑘= 1. Due
to the incompleteness of the 𝑃-wave structure our result predicts that LF momentum distribution
for deuteron depends explicitly on the transverse component of the relative momentum on the light
front. This is highly unusual result, implication of which will be discussed in the next section.
For polarized deuteron the quantity that can be probed in the reaction (1) the tensor asymmetry
which we define as:
𝐴𝑇=

(𝑘, 𝑘⊥) + 𝑛𝜆𝑑=−1

Here because of the same incompleteness of the ”𝑃−𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒” structure one may expect more
sensitivity that for unpolarized momentum distribution.

The new term and the non-nucleonic components in the deuteron:
One of our main predictions is that the LF momentum distribution, Eq.(12) will explicitly
depend on the transverse component of the deuteron internal momentum on the light front. Such a
dependence is impossible for non-relativistic quantum mechanics of the deuteron since in this case
the potential of the interaction is real (no inelasticities) and the solution of Lippmann-Schwinger
equation for partial S- and D-waves satisfies the “angular condition", according to which the
momentum distribution in the unpolarized deuteron depends on the magnitude of the relative
momentum only.
In the relativistic domain the definition of the interaction potential is not straightforward to
claim that the momentum distribution in Eq.(12) should satisfy the angular condition also in the
relativistic case (i.e. to be dependent only on the magnitude of 𝑘).
To check the situation in relativistic case one considers Weinberg type equation[15] on the
light-front for NN scattering amplitudes, in which only nucleonic degrees are considered, in the
CM of the NN system. One obtains[16]:
𝑇𝑁𝑁(𝛼𝑖, 𝑘𝑖⊥, 𝛼𝑓, 𝑘𝑓,⊥) ≡𝑇𝑁𝑁(𝑘𝑖,𝑧, 𝑘𝑖⊥, 𝑘𝑓,𝑧, 𝑘𝑓,⊥) = 𝑉(𝑘𝑖,𝑧, 𝑘𝑖⊥, 𝑘𝑓,𝑧, 𝑘𝑓,⊥)
