Figure 5 | Field-free switching of Néel vector in Pt/FCGT/CrSBr. (a) Schematics 
illustrating field-free 180° switching of the Néel vector in Pt/FCGT/CrSBr heterostructures. 
(b) Optical images of CrSBr flake and FCGT/CrSBr heterostructure. Green and red dashed 
lines show the area the CrSBr and FCGT flakes. The directions of the a- and b-axis of the 
CrSBr flake are indicated. (c) AHE hysteresis loops driven by out-of-plane magnetic fields 
(left panel) and currents applied along the direction of b-axis in CrSBr (right panel). The 
direction of current-induced switching is indicated. (d) Four half-loops driven by currents 
applied along the direction of b-axis in CrSBr. The device was preset by out-of-plane 
magnetic fields of of 10 kOe (red and blue triangles) and -20 kOe (purple and black 
triangles). Arrows indicate the direction of current sweeping. (e) AHE hysteresis loops 
driven by currents applied along the direction of a-axis in CrSBr. (f) AHE hysteresis loops 
driven by currents applied along the direction of b-axis in CrSBr at 150 K above the Néel 
temperature of CrSBr. (g) AHE hysteresis loops driven by currents applied along the 
direction of b-axis in CrSBr with various in-plane magnetic fields.
