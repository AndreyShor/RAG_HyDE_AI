The ρ-separated admissible pair of excursions (η1, η2) is in blue. D and D′ are the smaller ball and
the larger ball in pink respectively. Bottom: The configuration after resampling. γ′

Proof. Consider Lri such that Q(ri) ≥ρ, that is, mri(ρ) ≥ρ by (4.3). Hence, with probability at
least ρ, there exists a ρ-good pair of loops (γ1, γ2) in Lri+1 \ Lri at scale ri, which are such that
the clusters in Lri+1 containing them are disjoint and outermost. We now assume that this event
occurs, and extract from (γ1, γ2) a ρ-separated admissible pair of excursions in Bri. We select such
a pair of excursions in an arbitrary way, and denote it by (η1, η2) from now on. Assume ηj is from
xj to yj. Now, the ending parts of η1 and η2 are (2ρri)-away in Lri, in the sense of (4.1) with
δs replaced by ρri. We cover ∂Bri by a chain of O(ρ−1) balls of radius ρri/4, with centers on
∂Bri, such that the centers of two neighboring balls are at distance ρri/4 (with possibly at most
one exception, for which the distance is smaller than ρri/4). For each j = 1, 2, we distinguish the
following two cases.
Case (1). Suppose ηj ⊂D for some ball D in the previous chain. Let D′ be the ball of radius
ρri/2 concentric with D. We further consider two subcases. If γj ⊂D′, then we add a loop that
stays in D′ \ D and surrounds D with some universal positive probability. If γj is not contained
