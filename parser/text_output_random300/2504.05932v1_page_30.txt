in the following. We can eliminate f from the right hand side by using (121), leaving us with
 d2

 d

s −α2)Cα,−κr(C)−κr,−κsC−κs = ˆf[Cα + Cα,−κr(C)−κr,−κsC−κs] .
(139)
Performing the differentiation and using the identity from (127) leads to
h ˙ˆCα ˆC−κs + ˆCα ˙ˆC−κs

SκsC−κs + 2 ˆCα ˆC−κsSκs ˙C−κs + (κ2
s −α2) ˆCα,−κsSκsC−κs
= ˆf[Cα + Cα,−κs(C)−κs,−κsC−κs] .
(140)
Finally, we use (128) to rewrite (κ2
s −α2) ˆCα,−κs = ˆC−κs ˙ˆCα −ˆCα ˙ˆC−κs. The final result reads
h

ˆCα = ˆf ˆCα ,

from which we can read off the solutions for ˆf as
ˆf =

Hence, the non-perturbative part ˆf of F can be expressed in terms of the same building blocks
as the observables.
A.4
The moments
Recall the differential equation relating moments ϕℓto ϕℓ−1 from (35), which we can also write
as
¨ϕℓ−2
˙ˆC0
ˆC0
˙ϕℓ= 2ℓ(2ℓ−1)π−2ϕℓ−1 .
(143)
The proposed trans-series for the moments (63) takes then the form
ϕℓ= ϕ(0)

A similar equation can be obtained for the generalised moments from (64) and reads
¨ϕα;ℓ−2 ˙χα

˙ϕα;ℓ+ α2ϕα;ℓ= 2ℓ(2ℓ−1)π−2ϕα;ℓ−1 .
(146)
Considering only the perturbative part of the equation above we can find the relation for the
