Misner-Sharp equations and approach for type-II fluctuations
The Misner-Sharp equations [56] describe the motion of a relativistic fluid with spherical
symmetry. This corresponds to the Einstein field equations written in the comoving slicing
and comoving threading, which both define the comoving gauge. To obtain them, first of all,
we need to consider a perfect fluid with the energy-momentum tensor,
T µν = (p + ρ)uµuν + pgµν,
(2.1)
and with the following spacetime metric in spherical symmetry:
ds2 = −A(r, t)2dt2 + B(r, t)2dr2 + R(r, t)2dΩ2,
(2.2)
where R(r, t) is the areal radius, A(r, t) is the lapse function, dΩ2 = dθ2+sin2(θ)dϕ2 is the line
element of a two-sphere and we have chosen zero-shift vector βi = 0 (comoving threading).
The components of the four-velocity uµ are given by ut = 1/A and ui = 0 for i = r, θ, ϕ,
since we are considering comoving coordinates (comoving slicing).
Solving the Einstein field equations, the following quantities appear:

A(r, t)
∂R(r, t)
∂t
≡DtR ≡U(r, t),
1
B(r, t)
∂R(r, t)
∂r
≡DrR ≡Γ(r, t),
(2.3)
where Dt and Dr are the proper time and distance derivatives, respectively. From now on,
we will use the notation R′ ≡∂rR (partial radial-derivative) and ˙R ≡∂tR (partial time-
derivative). U is the radial component of the four-velocity associated with an Eulerian frame
(so not comoving), which measures the radial velocity of the fluid with respect to the origin
of the coordinates. The Misner-Sharp mass M(r, t) is introduced as:
M(R) ≡
Z R

4π ˜R2ρ d ˜R ,

which is related with Γ, U and R though the constraint:
Γ =

(2.5)
where Γ is called the generalised Lorentz factor, which includes the gravitational potential
energy and kinetic energy per unit mass. Finally, the differential equations governing the
