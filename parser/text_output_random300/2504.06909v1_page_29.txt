component and the eddy component. The two other components (mean thermodynamic and non-
linear) are negligible. Note that this is qualitatively different from simulations of anthropogenic
climate change where the thermodynamic effect tends to dominate, leading to an approximate
Clausius-Clapeyron scaling for P−E (Held and Soden 2006), which holds relatively well over
ocean regions (Byrne and O’Gorman 2015).
We start by discussing the interpretation of the two dominant terms in the interactive-SST case
(Fig. 13, a). The spatial structure of the total P−E change mostly matches the structure of the
contribution due to MMC changes 𝛿MDyn. These changes are directly related to the response of
the MMC to the imposed tropical torque (Fig. 1) and are consistent with the meridional energy
transport changes (Section 4a): the collapse of the Hadley cells accounts for the negative sign of
𝛿MDyn within approximately 10◦S-10◦N and its positive sign poleward of 15◦in each hemisphere.
Similarly, the large shift of the Ferrell cells contributes to the poleward flank of the region of
positive moisture convergence changes between 15◦-40◦, and explains the negative changes around
50◦as well as the small positive contribution closer to the poles.
The eddy moisture flux changes 𝛿Eddy act mostly as a modulator of the changes imposed by the
MMC changes: the two components have opposite sign in the regions centered on 50◦, 20◦and
10◦. This results in small shifts of the total P−E changes compared to the 𝛿MDyn contribution.
