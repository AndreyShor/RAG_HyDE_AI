Constraint Ablation. In our method, We introduced multiple constraints. We performed experi-
ments by removing the physical and temporal constraints to evaluate the impact on performance.
Besides, to validate whether the inclusion of pressure p is beneficial for prediction, we also designed
an experiment: no Velocity-Pressure Constraint, which removes e1 in Eq. 12. Results in Figure 9
(a) and Table 3 show that the inclusion of constraints and p is beneficial for prediction.
Model Ablation. We introduced a correction network to refine the gradient operator. We conducted
experiments to evaluate performance without this network. The results are shown in Figure 9 (b).
The correction network notably improves accuracy, especially in later predicted frames.
Discrete PDEs Ablation. In Eq. 4, the prediction operator use c(t′) to predict, which might be re-
placed with c(tk). We conducted two sets of experiments: one where c(t′) replace c(tk) and another
involving modifications to the prediction operator. The results, presented in Figure 9 (c), show that
while these adjustments improve accuracy in the initial frames, the error increases significantly as
the number of predicted frames increases.

consumption.
Our model
employs a 3D structure in
both 2D and 3D scenarios,
this results in higher memory
usage in 2D scenes.
Con-
versely, in 3D scenes, our

exhibits
relatively

CONCLUSION
This paper introduces the Physics-Informed Neural Predictor (PINP) model, designed for predicting
spatiotemporal evolution. The PINP model leverages latent multi-quantity modeling and integrates
PDEs directly into the neural network framework, enabling enhanced understanding and accurate
prediction of dynamical systems.
A key feature of the PINP model is its ability to estimate latent physical quantities that are not
directly observed in the data. This provides more comprehensive analysis of the physical processes
underlying the observed dynamics. The model’s architecture embeds the governing PDEs, ensuring
that physical constraints are adhered to during both training and prediction phases. This integration
leads to improved consistency with physics, facilitating robust long-term forecasts.
When evaluated against a range of baseline methods, the PINP demonstrates better prediction ac-
curacy, particularly in its ability to extrapolate over extended temporal horizons and generalize spa-
tially. This was confirmed through testing on multiple benchmark datasets, where PINP’s predictions
aligned more closely with ground truth than those of competing approaches. In future research, we
aim to expand the application of the PINP model to more complex and comprehensive tasks, ac-
counting for other type of governing PDEs.
