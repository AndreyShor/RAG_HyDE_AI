ABSTRACT
We report the detection of a potential quasi-periodic signal with a period of ∼2 years in the blazar
ON 246, based on Fermi-LAT (γ-rays) and ASAS-SN (optical) observations spanning 11.5 years (MJD
55932–60081). We applied various techniques to investigate periodic signatures in the light curves,
including the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), and RED-
FIT. The significance of the signals detected in LSP and WWZ was assessed using two independent
approaches: Monte Carlo simulations and red noise modeling. Our analysis revealed a dominant peak
in the γ-ray and optical light curves, with a significance level exceeding 3σ in both LSP and WWZ,
consistently persisting throughout the observation period. Additionally, the REDFIT analysis con-
firmed the presence of a quasi-periodic signal at ∼0.00134 day−1 with a 99% confidence threshold.
To explain the observed quasi-periodic variations in γ-ray and optical emissions, we explored various
potential physical mechanisms. Our analysis suggests that the detected periodicity could originate
from a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) system or the jet-induced orbital motion within such
a system. Based on variability characteristics, we estimated the black hole mass of ON 246. The study
suggests that the mass lies within the range of approximately (0.142 −8.22) × 109 M⊙.
1. INTRODUCTION
Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are one of the most en-
ergetic astrophysical objects in the universe, powered by
the accretion of matter of galaxy on supermassive black
hole (SMBHs) with a mass in the range 106 −1010M⊙
(A. So ltan 1982). Blazars, a subset of radio-loud AGNs,
are among the most luminous objects with the bolometic
luminosity in the range of 1041 −1048 erg s−1. Blazars
produce relativistic jets that are aligned within a few
degrees (< 5◦) of our line of sight (G. Ghisellini et al.
1993; C. M. Urry & P. Padovani 1995; R. Blandford
et al. 2019) and emit radiation over entire electromag-
netic (EM) spectrum, from radio to very high energy
(>100 GeV) γ-rays (C. M. Urry & P. Padovani 1995;
M.-H. Ulrich et al. 1997; P. Padovani 2017). Blazars are
further classified into two subclasses: BL Lacertae (BL
Lacs) and flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), based
on the characteristics and strength of broad emission
lines in their optical spectra. BL Lacs exhibit feature-
less nonthermal optical spectra (very weak or absence

of the lines), while the FSRQs show bright and strong
broad emission lines with equivalent width (EW)> 5 ˚A
in the rest frame (P. Giommi et al. 2012).
Observational studies have shown that these sources
exhibit rapid and large flux modulations across the en-
tire band of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum from
radio to VHE γ-ray, jet-dominated nonthermal emis-
sion that leads to the double-humped spectral energy
distribution (M.-H. Ulrich et al. 1997; G. a.
Fossati
et al. 1998). The variation in emission provides valu-
able insights into various aspects of blazars, including
structures, underlying emission mechanisms/processes,
and physical parameters of SMBHs (M.-H. Ulrich et al.
1997; A. C. Gupta 2017). The observed flux variability
timescale in all bands ranges from minutes to several
years. Blazar’s central region is very compact and often
difficult to resolve directly with current facilities. By an-
alyzing the rapid variability with timescale from minutes
to hours, one can constrain the emission-region sizes of
these sources effectively, and utilizing the simultaneous
observations with theoretical models, we can constrain
the physical parameters of jets (R. Blandford & C. F.
McKee 1982; F. Tavecchio et al. 1998; S. Li et al. 2018;
A. Pandey & C. Stalin 2022).
