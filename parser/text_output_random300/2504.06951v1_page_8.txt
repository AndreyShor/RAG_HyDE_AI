Note that indeed 2N = P
{J | 2J/N∈[0,1]} C(J, N)(2J + 1), so that νN([0, 1]) = 1. We recall the well-known
resolution of the identity [28], that is,
12J+1 = 2J + 1
4π
Z
S2 dµS2(Ω)Pr(J, Ω),
(3.12)
where dµS2 is the uniform measure on the 2-sphere, and Pr(J, Ω) is the one-dimensional projection onto
the linear span of the (2J + 1)-dimensional spin-coherent state vector labeled by the point Ω∈S2. Let

:= Tr2J+1[PN(J)Pr(J, Ω)].
By inserting the identity (3.12), we can write
Tr2J+1(PN(J)) = 2J + 1

S2 dµS2(Ω)Tr2J+1[PN(J)Pr(J, Ω)] = 2J + 1

If we set KN(du, dΩ) := νN(du) ×
1
4πµS2(dΩ), equations (3.10), (3.11) and (3.13) imply that
1
2N Tr2N [P(hCW
0
(SN))] =
Z
[0,1]×S2 KN(du, dΩ)pN(u, Ω),
where the integral over [0, 1] should be interpreted as the discrete integral with respect to νN. It is clear
that KN is a probability meausure for each N. Using the previous preparatory statements, we are now in
a position to prove the following facts.
(i) For all N ∈N+, it holds

(3.14)
the constant C being independent of J, Ωand N.
(ii) The sequence of probability measures (KN)N converges setwise to the probability measure δ0 × 1
4πµS2,
with δ0 the Dirac measure concentrated at 0 ∈[0, 1].
For (i), we first rely on the following fact obtained in [17]. For any non-commuting self-adjoint polynomial
H(J) := P0(SN)|2J+1 on C2J+1, it holds
sup
J∈JN

(3.15)
where the constant C > 0 only depends on the chosen P0, not on J, Ωand N.
To prove (3.14), we stress that for any given polynomial P, the operator P ◦hCW
0
(SN) is again a polynomial
in three non coummuting self-adjoint spin operators.
As a matter of fact, the statement (3.14) follows from (3.15) for the choice P0 = P ◦hCW
0
.
In order to see that (ii) holds, we rewrite
