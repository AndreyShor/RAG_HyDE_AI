where 𝐵𝑉𝑧𝑉𝑧 represents the autocorrelation function of 𝑉𝑧, while 𝑉𝑧
2 denotes the expected value

2   averaged over both 𝑞 and 𝑙 instances. The 
functions 𝑗0 and 𝑗1 are spherical Bessel functions of the first kind of zero and first order, 
respectively, and 𝜃𝑠 denotes the angle between ∆𝜀 and the z-axis. By performing an angular 
integration of the autocorrelation function over 𝜃𝑠 from 0 to 2π within two-dimensional planes, 
the angular integral autocorrelation (𝐵𝐴𝐼𝐴) expressions for the xy, xz, and yz planes are derived 
[39] as

where ∆𝜌 represents the one-dimensional lag in the angular integral autocorrelation argument. 
The local wavenumber 𝑘 is extracted by analyzing the 2D autocorrelation function within a 
localized region of a reverberant field and fitting the resulting autocorrelation profiles to 
Equation 3.a or 3.b, depending on the plane configuration. Given the excitation frequency 𝜔, 
the shear wave speed 𝐶𝑠 is determined using the relation 𝐶𝑠= 𝜔/𝑘. 
To implement the angular integral autocorrelation approach in a multi-frequency 
reverberant shear wave field, it is essential to extract the particle velocity at each frequency 
using a bandpass filter. This method enables the separate estimation of SWS for each frequency. 
By incorporating multiple frequencies into the SWS estimation process, a more comprehensive 
analysis of shear wave behavior is achieved, leading to improved diagnostic capabilities and 
deeper insight into tissue dynamics. 
The power-law model provides a mathematical framework for characterizing the frequency-
dependent dispersion of SWS in viscoelastic bio-materials. Within the Kelvin-Voigt fractional 
derivative model, this relationship is expressed as 
𝐶𝑠(𝑓) = 𝐶0𝑓
𝑎

where 𝑓 is the frequency, 𝐶0 represents the reference wave speed at a unit reference frequency 
(e.g., 1 Hz), and 𝑎 is the dispersion coefficient [28] of the complex shear modulus. 
 
3. Multi-frequency reverberant elastography simulation 
The k-Wave toolbox in MATLAB (version 2022b, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) 
[40] was employed to assess the effectiveness of multi-frequency reverberant shear wave fields 
for SWS estimation. The simulation involved a two-sided medium, consisting of a softer side 
with an SWS of 1 m/s and a stiffer side with an SWS of 2 m/s, as depicted in Fig. 1(a). The 
model was constructed as a cube with dimensions of 12 mm × 12 mm × 2.4 mm. Both the softer 
and stiffer sides were modeled as homogeneous isotropic materials with a density of 1000 
kg/m³. 
In order to generate a multi-frequency reverberant shear wave field, 1000 point-velocity 
excitation sources were utilized. The region of interest (ROI) was defined as a smaller cube 
with dimensions of 10 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm (Fig. 1). To create a source-free reverberant
