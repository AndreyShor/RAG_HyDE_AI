By virtue this lemma, it can be easily shown that the inequality in Proposition 2 holds strictly in several cases.
Proposition 3. Consider the FJ-MM with matrices (6), where W is some stochastic matrix and ˜W characterizes
the joint impact of social inertia (as in Use Case 3) and recent memory influence (as in Use Case 4). Specifically,
˜W = α1W + α2I,
α1, α2 ≥0,
α1 + α2 = 1.
Suppose also that Assumption 2 holds. Then the FJ-MM model converges strictly slower than the comparison FJ
model and than the original FJ model with matrix W. More precisely,
ρ( ¯Ad) = σ(1 −β0) +
p
σ(1 −β0)2 + 4β0
2
> ρ( ¯A) = ρ(ΛW) = σ.
(12)
Proof. We first compute the spectral radius for the FJ-MM model. Recalling that the eigenvalues of ¯Ad are such
scalars λ such that ¯Adv = λv, with some vector v = [v⊤
1 ; v⊤
2 ]⊤, then observing that v2 = λv1, one proves that
(ΛβW + Λ(1 −β0)(α1W + α2I)λ)v1 = λ2v1.
(13)
Substituting Λ = σI and using the Perron-Frobenius theorem, the spectral radius ρ( ¯Ad) is the maximum of numbers
λ ≥0 such that
0 = det(λ2I −λσ(1 −β0)W −σβ0(α1W + α2I)) = det((λ2 −σβ0α2)I −[λσ(1 −β0) + σβ0α1]),
(14)
Notice that λσ(1−β0)+σβ0α1 > 0, because if it were not, then λ = 0 and α1 = 0, which would imply λ2 −σβ0α2 =
−σβ0 < 0. Consequently, λ could not be a root of equation (14). Hence, the number
µ :=
λ2 −σβ0α2
λσ(1 −β0) + σβ0α1
∈R
(15)
µ appears as an eigenvalue of W. Conversely, if µ is an eigenvalue of W and satisfies (15), then λ is an eigenvalue
of ¯Ad. By treating (15) as a quadratic equation in λ and selecting its maximal (nonnegative) root, one can show
that the spectral radius ρ( ¯Ad) is given by
ρ( ¯Ad) = max
µ

which maximum is taken over all real µ eigenvalues of W and, obviously, is achieved at µ = 1.
Recalling that α1 + α2 = 1 > σ, one finally notices that
ρ( ¯Ad) = σ(1 −β0)

which proves (12) and finishes the proof of Proposition 3.
It is interesting to note that under Assumption 2, the spectral radius of ¯Ad is independent of the coefficients α1
and α2, e.g., the FJ-MM model exhibits the same convergence rate in Use Case 3 as in Use Case 4.
The following numerical example illustrates that, for Λ = σI with σ being fixed and [β] = β0I, the spectral
radius in Use Case 3 depends only on β0 but not on the graph, as guaranteed by Proposition 3.
Example 4. Fig. 6 illustrates the numerical simulations, in which the convergence rate (maximal eigenvalue) of
the FJ-MM is computed for several graphs as a function of β0, assuming that Λ = 0.6I and [β] = β0I. Technically,
the example shows the results for an undirected cycle graph with N = 20 nodes, an Erdos-Renyi graph with N = 150
nodes and probability of edge creation 0.4, a Watts-Strogatz graph with N = 200 nodes, degree equal to 0.6N and
rewiring probability 0.7, and a complete graph with N = 50 nodes.
It can be observed that the convergence rate is, first, independent of the graph structure and, second, strictly
greater than that of the comparison FJ model (and of the original FJ model with matrix W), which equals σ = 0.6.
Using an analogous proof strategy, we can prove that the convergence result holds also in Use Case 1.
