reported infrared dielectric function of SrTiO356,57. Our work particularly focuses on the SPhPs in 
RB2 and RB3 (highlighted in Fig.1b) that can be experimentally probed by SINS.  
 
We calculate the dispersion relationship and quality factor of SPhPs in suspended SrTiOâ‚ƒ 
membranes. The symmetric and antisymmetric modes (as determined by the parity of the Ez field 
component) are formed due to the interaction of the SPhPs at the upper and lower membrane 
surface. The dispersions of these two modes in a membrane of thickness  suspended in air are 
given by the following implicit relations58,59,

where 0() =  /6 is the free-space wavevector, and -./()  and 4-./() are the complex-
valued wavevectors for the higher-energy symmetric mode and the lower-energy antisymmetric 
mode, respectively.  
 
Solving equations (1) and (2) generates the complex-valued polariton wavevector   as a function 
of frequency .  The calculated dispersions for the SPhPs in RB2 and RB3 of suspended SrTiOâ‚ƒ 
are shown in Fig.1c. As the thickness is reduced, the energy splitting between the antisymmetric 
(solid lines) and symmetric (dashed lines) modes and the real part of the in-plane momentum   
for the antisymmetric mode increase across all frequencies in both RB2 and RB3. For membranes 
with deep-subwavelength thickness (30-100 nm), the symmetric SPhPs are non-propagating 
modes (also known as epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) modes60) exhibiting very small group velocities, 
whereas the antisymmetric SPhPs are propagating modes. The confinement factor 7 =

which quantifies the compression of the wavelength in SPhPs as compared to light, increases from 
10 in 100 nm membranes to over 30 in 30 nm membranes for the far-infrared antisymmetric SPhPs 
in RB2 (Supplemental Note 2 and Supplementary Fig.2). We also calculate the Q factor (Fig.1d), 
which characterizes the optical loss for the SPhPs propagation. We note that the expected quality 
factors in the bulk limit for SPhPs with little confinement are extremely high (up to 102 in RB3 and 
103 and RB2) and comparable to the best SPhP materials, such as SiC1. The higher value in RB2 
indicates a longer SPhP propagation length61. As the thickness is reduced to submicron scales, the 
Q factor lowers significantly while the confinement factor increases. Interestingly, when the 
membrane thickness is reduced below 100 nm, Re() scales with Im() and the Q factor is 
nearly independent of thickness. This behavior is consistent with the results previously reported in 
SiC thin films59. Notably, in the RB2 band, high Q factors peaking at 25 are obtained for far-
infrared antisymmetric SPhPs, comparable to that of SPhPs in top polaritonic materials such as 
SiC, hBN and MoO3 are observed (a detailed comparison will be provided later). In contrast, the
