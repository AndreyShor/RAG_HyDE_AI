the conclusions of detailed seismic analyses of massive stars45;46.
The solar modelling problem is linked to both microphysical and macrophysical aspects of stan-
dard solar models (See Christensen-Dalsgaard 20211 for a deﬁnition of the standard solar model
framework) and thus to how we depict the processes acting in the Sun. Standard models entirely
neglect rotation, thus failing to reproduce the observed depletion of lithium in the Sun. Revis-
ing the “recipe” for solar models implies a revision of the ingredients used for other stars in the
Universe as well, particularly impacting the masses, radii and ages inferred from the seismic
modelling of low-mass stars. In massive stars, opacity modiﬁcations signiﬁcantly alter the os-
cillation properties47;48;50. Previous work49;46 has shown that modifying opacity in the direction
of the experiments would improve the agreement with asteroseismic observations.
Recently, Eggenberger et al. (2022)32 showed that reproducing the solar lithium abundance also
brought the Ycz value of low metallicity models in agreement with helioseismic measurements,
linking it to the angular momentum transport mechanism allowing to reproduce the solar rota-
tion proﬁle. They showed that the link between lithium and helium was robust with respect to
the form and physical origin of the mixing at the BCZ. In this work, we combine these results
with the approach of Buldgen et al. (2020)51 to provide a seismic measurement of the mean
Rosseland opacity independently from any theoretical opacity table. Our approach is weakly
impacted by the equation of state and nuclear reaction rates used. We are thus able to analyze in
details the output of theoretical opacity computations. Technical details on our procedure can
be found in the Methods section.
