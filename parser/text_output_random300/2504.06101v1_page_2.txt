chiral hinge states that propagate along a closed path
of hinges of a finite 3D sample. In Sec. IV, we extend
these considerations to the fractional case using bosoniza-
tion techniques.
We show that, for sufficiently strong
electron-electron interactions, our model can realize a
fractional chiral SOTI phase with gapless chiral hinge
states carrying only a fraction of the electronic charge.
Finally, we conclude in Sec. V.

MODEL
A.
Main model based on helical magnetic fields
We construct a model for a 3D SOTI from an array
of weakly coupled 1D nanowires aligned along the x di-
rection, as shown in Fig. 1. A unit cell in our model is
composed of four wires.
The position of a unit cell is
denoted by indices n in the z direction and m in the y
direction, while within a unit cell, each wire is labeled
by indices τ and ν, with τ = 1 (τ = ¯1) denoting the left
(right) wire relative to the z axis, and ν = 1 (ν = ¯1) the
top (bottom) wire relative to the y axis (see Fig. 1). The
spin quantization axis is set to be along the z direction.
We assume that neighboring wires are weakly coupled
with coupling amplitudes that are small compared to the
chemical potential µ inside each wire. This assumption
allows us to first treat each wire as completely indepen-
dent and then add the coupling terms perturbatively.
The kinetic part of the Hamiltonian describing the un-
coupled wires is given by

nmτνσ(x) and Ψnmτνσ(x) are the creation and
annihilation operators of an electron with spin σ ∈{1, ¯1}
at the position x of the wire (τ, ν) in the unit cell (n, m).
Furthermore, m0 is the effective electron mass, and we
put ℏ= 1. For infinitely long wires, the energy spec-
trum inside each wire takes a simple quadratic form:
E0 = k2
x/2m0 −µ, where E0 is twofold degenerate in spin
σ. The Fermi wave vector kF is related to the chemical
potential by kF = √2m0µ.
Next, we introduce a magnetic field rotating in the xy

sionless parameter l determines the rotation period of the
magnetic field, given by πl/kF , and is assumed to be ei-
ther a positive integer or a fraction of the form l = 1/p
with p being an odd positive integer. As we will see be-
low, l is related to the charge of the gapless hinge states
in such a way that the total charge carried by these states

FIG. 1.
Sketch of the 3D construction composed of 1D
nanowires aligned along the x axis.
The unit cell consists
of four nanowires. Each wire is labeled by indices (n, m, τ, ν),
where the discrete indices (n, m) denote the position of the
unit cell, and τ ∈{1, ¯1}, ν ∈{1, ¯1} denote the position of the
wire inside the unit cell. The magnetic field acting inside each
wire rotates clockwise (counterclockwise) in the xy plane for
wires with τν = 1 (τν = ¯1) as shown by black (white) arrows.
In the coupled-wires approach, each wire is first considered in-
dependently and then the coupling between neighboring wires
is introduced perturbatively.

The required rotating magnetic field defined in Eq. (2)
can be generated in several ways, for example, by ex-
trinsic nanomagnets [35–38], a magnetic skyrmion tex-
ture [39–43], or helical local magnetic moments formed
via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions [44–
47]. Another option is to use a combination of spin-orbit
interaction (SOI) in Rashba nanowires and uniform mag-
netic fields instead of the rotating fields [48]; see Sec. II B.
We now introduce tunneling processes between neigh-
boring wires. The tunneling along the y direction is as-
