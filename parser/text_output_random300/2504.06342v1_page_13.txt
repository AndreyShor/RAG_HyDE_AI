Figure 3. Projection plots of gas properties viewed from the polar angle within 100 kpc radius at different evolutionary
stages with varying BH luminosity: volume-weighted number density ùëõH (top), mass-weighted temperature (middle),
and mass-weighted radial velocity with overplotted velocity streamlines (bottom). The simulation time and AGN
luminosities are annotated for each column. The halo-scale gas properties exhibit substantial temporal variations
indicative of AGN-driven outflows and feedback effects, though without direct correlation to instantaneous AGN
luminosity due to delayed response timescales of the halo gas.
and mass-weighted radial velocity with overplotted
velocity streamlines (bottom).
The halo-scale gas properties demonstrate sig-
nificant temporal evolution and spatial structure.
Several characteristic features are evident:
(i) High-temperature, outward-expanding shells
with pronounced density and temperature
gradients, indicative of strong AGN-driven
outflows (ùë°= 57, 67 and 166 Myr);
(ii) Central hot spots with ùëá‚â≥108 K signifying
either recently launched AGN winds during
high accretion rates or cold-mode AGN ac-
tivity (ùë°= 57 and 444 Myr);
(iii) Post-outflow regions characterized by inter-
mediate temperatures and low densities, re-
flecting the aftermath of past AGN feedback
episodes (ùë°= 302 and 902 Myr).
Notably, no direct correlation exists between the
instantaneous AGN luminosity and the halo-scale
gas properties.
This lack of immediate corre-
spondence is consistent with the substantial dif-
ference between the halo gas dynamical timescale
(‚àº0.1 Gyr) and the more rapid AGN variability
timescale demonstrated in Fig. 2. Consequently,
the large-scale gas properties reflect the delayed
and integrated effects of AGN feedback over ex-
tended periods rather than responding to instan-
taneous AGN activity. This temporal disconnect
between central AGN behavior and halo-scale gas
dynamics highlights the importance of considering
different characteristic timescales when interpret-
ing feedback effects across varying spatial scales.
