MSPC and MEPC in two-dimensional ferromagnets tak-
ing into account magnon relaxation time.
In Sec.
II,
we derive the magnon spin photoconductivity tensor and
magnon energy photoconductivity tensor through quan-
tum kinetics theroy, and discuss the topological prop-
erty of the magnon spin photoconductivity tensors in
the case of low optical frequency and infinite relaxation
time. In Sec. III, we discuss the constraint of effective
time-reversal symmetry on reciprocal space structure of
magnon.
In Sec.
IV, we take a numerical calculation
of the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Hexagonal lattice
model and Kagome lattice model to study the method
of controlling the MSPC and MEPC. we calculate and
discuss the variation of magnon spin photoconductivity
and magnon energy photoconductivity with optical fre-
quency under different relaxation time. In addition, un-
der the condition of low optical frequency and infinite re-
laxation time, the MSPC and MEPC moves sinusoidal in
the time-dependent electric field. The magnon spin (en-
ergy) photoconductivity determines the oscillation am-
plitude of the MS(E)PC and can hopefully be controlled
by the topological property of the system.

FORMALISM
The system considered by us is a two-dimensional
collinear out-of-plane ferromagnet, in which the ferro-
magnet is located in the x −y plane and the spin points
in the positive direction of the z axis.
A.
Aharonov-Casher effect and the Hamiltonian of
magnon
Without the time-dependent electric field, the single-
magnon Hamiltonian is expressed as
ˆH0 which satis-
fies
ˆH0 |ψn(k)⟩
=
εn(k) |ψn(k)⟩.
Here, |ψn(k)⟩
=
eik·r |un(k)⟩is Bloch state of magnon, and εn(k) is the
energy of magnon band. The perturbation Hamiltonian
induced by a time-dependent electric field is expressed as
ˆH′(t).
We consider the effect of time-dependent electric field
on magnon through Aharonov-Casher effect (AC) phase.
Magnons acquire a geometric phase when they move in
an electric field53,65,66.

Here, E(t) is the electric field of light, gJ is the Land´e
factor, µB is the Bohr magneton and clv is light velocity.
And ˆeµ is a unit vector on the magnetic moment direction
of the particle. We assume that the spatial variation scale
of the electric field is much larger than the scale of lattice
constant. So the AC phase can be expressed as66

in which dij is the displacement from position i to posi-
tion j. The perturbative Hamiltonian ˆH′(t) of AC effect
can be expressed as65,66

Here,

c∂tE(t) × ˆez is the effective electric
field, and E(t) is the applied time-dependent electric field
which can be expressed as E(t) = P
j E(ωj)e−iωjt, in
which E(ωi) is the complex amplitude of electric field
(detail see Appendix A). Therefore, the effective elec-
tric field can be expressed as ˜E(t) = P

which ˜E(ωj) is

Here, subscripts a, b label the direction in Cartesian co-
ordinates, a, b = x, y. Eb(ωj) is the complex amplitude
in the direction of b with the light frequency ωj. And
ϵabz is Levi-Civita symbol, clv is light velocity.

The methods for calculating magnon
photo-transport
In this subsection, we discuss the methods to derive
MSPC and MEPC induced by time-dependent electric
field. Because the magnon number is not conserved, the
chemical potential of magnon is zero. Therefore, the en-
ergy current of magnon is equal to the heat current of
magnons.
Because each magnon excitation carries the spin angu-
lar momentum ℏin systems with conservation of the total
spin along the z direction, the MSPC can be expressed
as46,64,66
j = ℏtr [ˆρˆv] .

Here, ˆρ is density matrix of one-magnon which can be
expressed by expanding by order ˆρ = P
α ˆρ(α), in which α
labels the order of the correction of density matrix. And
