(11) translate into

Sk = S∗

where we introduced the real quantities Xk and Yk. It follows that the unitarity equations
(12) can be written as

These equations contain N and n as parameters that do not need to be integers. In particular,
the limit n →0 yielding quenched disorder can be taken straightforwardly.
The derivation of Eqs. (15)-(20) implies that their solutions are the renormalization group
ﬁxed points of a system of Nn Ising models constrained by invariance under spin reversals

and permutations of the N copies and of the n replicas. These symmetries,
however, allow for the addition to the Hamiltonian (8) of terms coupling the diﬀerent copies3,
so that the space of solutions of (15)-(20) still includes ﬁxed points which are not of interest
for the problem we study in this paper. In our present case the Ising copies are correlated
only by the disorder average, and their number N is not a physical parameter of the problem.
This requires that, for n = 0, the space of solutions of (15)-(20) contains a N-independent
subspace corresponding to the ﬁxed points of our interest. Remarkably, it is immediately
seen that, at n = 0, the N-dependent terms in (15)-(20) cancel under the condition
S4 = S1 .
(21)
3This is why Eqs. (15)-(20) also arise in the study of the disordered N-color Ashkin-Teller model [13].
