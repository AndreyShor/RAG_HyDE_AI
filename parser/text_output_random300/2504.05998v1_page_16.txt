FIG. S.5. Minimum power of the probe signal such that at least one photon can be transmitted through the GIT channel in a time τmin given
by (S.49). The plot shows the lower bound estimated in Eq. (S.51) for a cavity frequency of ωA ≈1015. This figure assumes a linearized
Newtonian force and an experimental apparatus characterized by the gravitational critical frequency reported in Eq. (S.44). The red star
corresponds to the parameters of Fig. S.1. The black dotted lines are the borders between the quantum and classical regions analyzed in Fig.
S.2.
