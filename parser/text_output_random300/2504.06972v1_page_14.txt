Methods 
2H-MoTe2 crystal growth 
High-purity molybdenum powder (99.997% Mo) and tellurium powder (99.999%) 
were thoroughly mixed at a molar ratio of 1:30 and loaded into a quartz ampule. The 
ampule was then sealed under high vacuum (∼10⁻⁵ Torr) and heated to 1100 °C over a 
period of 20 hours, followed by a 20-hour dwell at the same temperature. Subsequently, 
the ampule was cooled at a rate of 6 °C/h to 550 °C before centrifugation. To further 
remove excess tellurium flux, the MoTe₂ crystals were transferred to a second vacuum-
sealed ampule and subjected to a temperature gradient (Tₕₒₜ = 420 °C, ΔT ∼ 200 °C) 
with the crystals placed at the hot end for 16 hours before cooling to room temperature. 
This procedure effectively removed excess tellurium flux, resulting in high-quality 2H-
MoTe2 crystals. 
 
Device fabrications 
The tMoTe2 device is fabricated with a triple-gated geometry, as described in Ref. 4,49.
