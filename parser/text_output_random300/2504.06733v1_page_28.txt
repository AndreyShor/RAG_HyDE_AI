eV between the Ar 2p core-level signal for the first endofullerene layer and for sub-
sequent layers facilitates easy identification of this contribution to the photoemission
spectra. The endofullerene molecules above the first layer also make a characteristic
contribution to the low energy electron diffraction (LEED) pattern, forming a weak
multi-domain pattern that is distinct from the (2

In order to better compare our Ar@C60 photoemission data with previously published
(and extensive) work on the empty C60-on-Ag(111) system[15], we have artificially
broadened (via numerical convolution) our C 1s spectrum for the close-to-1-ML
Ar@C60 sample with a Gaussian having a full width at half maximum of 0.4 eV.
This is to match the experimental resolution reported by Pedio et al.[15] for their
C 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. This comparison is
shown in Fig.S7. Note that, despite the presence of a small amount of additional
enodfullerene material above the first chemisrobed monolayer, the width of the C
1s peak for Ar@C60/Ag(111) is significantly narrower than that for empty C60 on
Ag(111). We attribute this to the difference in sample preparation conditions. Pedio
et al. deposited fullerene molecules onto a sample that was at room temperature. The
Ar@C60 monolayer was instead formed via deposition onto a Ag(111) crystal held at
180 K, circumventing “nanopitting” at the fullerene-Ag(111) interface[18] and leading
to both a weaker and more homogeneous cage-surface interaction.

Fig. S5 Comparison of photoemission spectra for monolayer and multilayer coverages.
The main figure is a C 1s photoemission spectrum (acquired with a photon energy of 400 eV) of a
multilayer coverage of Ar@C60 on Ag(111) that clearly shows the significant (400 meV) difference in
core-level binding energy associated with endofullerene molecules in the first monolayer and in higher
layers. Inset to left: C 1s spectrum for a bulk-like Ar@C60 film sufficiently thick to “quench” Ag
3d photoemission intensity from the Ag(111) substrate on which it was grown. The shake-up features
are magnified in the inset. This spectrum is indistinguishable from that of empty C60. Inset to
right: Ar 2p photoemission spectrum (ℏω = 400 eV) for the same multilayer sample as shown in the
main figure. Again, there is a 400 meV shift towards lower binding energy for photoemission from
molecules in the first monolayer, as compared to those in higher layers.
