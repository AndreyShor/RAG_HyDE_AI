where qj and rj are the charge and position of the j-th par-

particle from the j-th particle. The pairwise e3dtf interaction,
νe3dtf(r, L), depends on the period L and the vector r, not
merely on the radial distance r = |r|. It exhibits even symme-
try with respect to r and can be formally written as a simple
Fourier series [13–17]

with the constant ξ being the ideal scattering coefficient for
the simple cubic lattice: ξ = 2.837 297 48 · · · (see Eq. (2.6)
and Table I of Ref.[18]). The physical meaning of ξ will be ex-
plained alternatively in the present work. In Eq. (5), n stands
for a triplet of integers: n = (n1, n2, n3) ∈Z3 and n = |n|.
For clarity, the double sum of an even function [Eq. (4)] and
the triple sum of an arbitrary function [Eq. (5)] are both ab-

The pairwise formulation [Eq. (4)] shows that νe3dtf(r, L)
plays the same role in periodic systems as the Coulomb in-
teraction 1/r does in isolated systems, regardless of whether
the system is electrically neutral or not.
As such, it be-
comes straightforward to generalize the formulation to sys-
tems involving additionally a charge continuum described by
a charge density, ρ(r),

for the continuum-continuum (cc) interaction energy, respec-
tively. In scenarios where boundary terms alternative to the
tinfoil boundary condition are imposed[13], the primary cell
adopts non-cubic shape, or the basic interaction deviates from
1/r, the interaction νe3dtf in Eqs. (4)-(8) is substituted with
the corresponding effective pairwise interaction ν(r), and thus
results in the generalized formula presented in the abstract.
The present unified pairwise formulation [Eqs. (4) to (8)]
for the general system consisting of both discrete point
charges and a distribution of charge density does not seem
to have appeared in literature.
Of course, an auxiliary
Ewald splitting parameter can always be introduced to rewrite
νe3dtf(r, L) as a combination of two rapidly convergent series
(see the Appendix or Eq.(3) of Ref.[14]). The corresponding
Ewald formulation must be independent of the auxiliary pa-
rameter and therefore can be physically meaningful. On the
other hand, the concise expression [Eq. (5)] has proven useful
for analytically predicting structural properties and dielectric
response within the framework of the symmetry-preserving
mean-field theory, applicable to both interfacial[15, 19, 20]
and bulk systems[16, 19]. Stimulated by the recent fruitful
discussions[11, 12], we apply various pairwise formulations
to investigate the particular system of the one-component
plasma with the uniform neutralizing background. The main
purposes of the present work are to emphasize the simplicity
and usefulness of the unified framework, to illustrate more an-
alytical properties associated with the periodic boundary con-
dition (PBC), and to clarify the contribution of the background
interactions.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Analo-
gous to that done for Eqs. (1) to (3), Section II conducts a
step-by-step analysis of the lattice sum of two basic interac-
tions, one being the usual 1/r and the other being a mod-
ified Coulomb interaction, also called the angular-averaged
(aa) Ewald potential[21–24]. This analysis yields effective in-
teractions, νe3dtf(r, L) and νaa(r, L), expressed as real- and
Fourier-space series that rigorously incorporate the effect of
PBC. Building upon these series for νe3dtf(r, L), νaa(r, L),
and other volume-dependent effective interactions, Section III
elucidates universal properties collectively characterizing pe-
riodic electrostatic systems, including symmetry and positiv-
ity, lattice periodicity, dominance over the Coulomb interac-
tion, cancellation of electric field, constant average potential,
constant potential of a uniform charge density, bulk invari-
ance, and scaling behavior. In Section IV, we derive a uni-
fied pairwise formulation of electrostatic energies including
Eqs. (4), (7) and (8). The effectiveness of these formulations
is demonstrated by an example of calculating the Madelung
constant for a crystal lattice. For the one-component plasma
with the uniform neutralizing background, our derivation pro-
duces results consistent with earlier work[11, 12, 23, 24] and
we clarify that the electrostatic energy of the background must
always be zero.
Section V establishes thermodynamically
consistent energy-pressure relations for systems governed by
certain pairwise interactions, addressing the viral definition of
pressure. We discuss criteria for custom volume-dependent
potentials that preserve these thermodynamic relations. Con-
cluding remarks are presented in Section VI. For complete-
ness, conventional Ewald formulations and expressions for
other effective pairwise interactions are included in the Ap-
pendix.

EFFECTIVE INTERACTIONS UNDER PBC
The Coulomb interaction, 1/r, describes the electric po-
tential at a target point located at a displacement r from a unit
point charge isolated in vacuum, that is, under the open bound-
ary condition. Under PBC, the unit source charge is placed
