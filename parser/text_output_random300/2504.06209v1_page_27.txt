Proof. (⇐) Suppose that I [A0:t+1S0:t; St:∞|Mt] = 0 for all t ∈N0. By using the single-step chain rule of mutual
information (eq. (A9)), with W = A0:t+1S0:t, X = St, Y = St+1:∞, and Z = Mt, we can write
I[A0:t+1S0:t; St:∞|Mt] = I[A0:t+1S0:t; St|Mt] + I[A0:t+1S0:t; St+1:∞|MtSt]
(F9)
for all t ∈N0.
Since the left-hand side vanishes by assumption (eq. (F8)), the nonnegativity of mutual infor-
mation implies that both terms on the right-hand side must independently vanish.
In particular, that means
I[A0:t+1S0:t; St|Mt] = 0 for all t ∈N0.
(⇒) The proof proceeds in two steps. First, we will show that
I [A0:t+1S0:t; Aj+1Sj|MtAt+1:j+1St:j] = 0
(F10)
for an arbitrary t ∈N0, and for j ∈{t, t + 1, . . . }. Second, the proof is concluded by an application of the chain rule
of mutual information.
In order to show eq. (F10), first consider the case j = t: Using the chain rule of mutual information in the form of
eq. (A10) with W = A0:j+1S0:j, X = Sj, Y = Aj+1 and Z = Mj gives
I [A0:j+1S0:j; Aj+1Sj|Mj] = I [A0:j+1S0:j; Sj|Mj] + I [A0:j+1S0:j; Aj+1|MjSj] .
(F11)
However, both terms on the right-hand side vanish, the first by assumption (eq. (F7)) and the second due to d-
separataion (see Figure 13), leaving us with
I [A0:j+1S0:j; Aj+1Sj|Mj] = 0
(F12)
for j ∈N0. But eq. (F12) is just eq. (F10) with t = j.

What is left to show is the case where j > t. First note that eq. (F12) still holds in that case. Additionally
we will make use of several other conditions involving the random variables A0:j+1S0:j, Mt, At+1:j+1St:j, Mj and
Aj+1Sj. Relations between those random variables can be represented by the information diagram in Figure 14. For
example, eq. (F10) then corresponds to two information atoms in the diagram, l+f. Altogether we have the following
conditions:
I [A0:j+1S0:j; Aj+1Sj|Mj] = 0 = a + b + c + d + e + f,
(F13)
I [Aj+1Sj; Mt|MjA0:j+1S0:j] = 0 = k,
(F14)
I[A0:t+1S0:t; Mj|MtAt+1:j+1St:j] = 0 = m + l,
(F15)
I[A0:t+1S0:t; Mj|MtAt+1:j+1St:jAj+1Sj] = 0 = m,
(F16)
where the last equality in each line expresses the condition through the information atoms defined in Figure 14.
The first condition, eq. (F13), is just eq. (F12). The conditions in eqs. (F14) to (F16) follow from d-separation (see
Figure 15 where for visualization purposes we set t to j −2).
From the information diagram in Figure 14 we see that eq. (F13) and eq. (F14) allow us to write
I [MtA0:j+1S0:j; Aj+1Sj|Mj] = a + b + c + d + e + f + k = 0.
