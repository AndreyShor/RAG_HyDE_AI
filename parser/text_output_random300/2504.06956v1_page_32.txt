exist and are related as stated. Hence, the conclusion follows by letting

(4.44)
which is positive and finite thanks to Lemma 4.18. Finally, the proof of Theorem B follows in exactly
the same way by taking F = 1 in (4.32).
Proof of Proposition 4.1 and of Theorem A. Consider a function F ∈Cb
loc(C(Rd)), then by (4.31)
from Proposition 4.14, the following equality holds
E0,u,b[F(Υb,g)1{M0,b(Υb,g)≤λ}]
P0,u,b(M0,b(Υb,g) ≤λ)
= Hl,λ(F) + eεb(l)
Hl,λ(1) + εb(l) ,
where liml→∞lim supb→∞|εb(l)| = 0 and liml→∞lim supb→∞|eεb(l)| = 0. The same argument as
in the proof of [BL18, Proposition 5.8] shows that both limits in
lim
b→∞
E0,u,b[F(Υb,g)1{M0,b(Υb,g)≤λ}]
P0,u,b(M0,b(Υb,g) ≤λ)
= lim
l→∞
Hl,λ(F)
Hl,λ(1)
(4.45)
exist and are related as stated. Similarly, using (4.33), we note that the same identity as in (4.45) holds
if we replace the field Υb,g on the left-hand side with Υb.
Regarding the limit on the right-hand side of (2.5), we note that, thanks to (4.32), for all F ∈Cb
loc(C(Rd)),
it holds that
lim
b→∞
E[F(Υ∞)1{M0,b(Υ∞)≤λ}]
P(M0,b(Υ∞) ≤λ)
= lim
l→∞
Hl,λ(F)
Hl,λ(1) .
(4.46)
Since the right-hand side of the above display is equal to the right-hand side of (4.45), the two limits
coincide.
Finally, it remains to show that there exists a continuous random field eΥλ on Rd such that the right-hand
side of (4.45) equals E[F(eΥλ)] for any F ∈Cb(C(Bk)). For each k ∈N and for any F ∈Cb(C(Bk)),
the limit on the left-hand side of (4.45) exists. In particular, when F = 1 this limit is 1 by definition.
By [Bog07, Theorem 8.7.1], this ensures the existence of a probability measure eνk,λ on C(Bk) such
that the right-hand side of (4.45) coincides with Eeνk,λ[F(Φ)], where under Peνk,λ the field Φ is
distributed according to eνk,λ. Furthermore, the collection of probability measures (eνk,λ)k∈N is
consistent, and so, by the Kolmogorov extension theorem, there exists a unique probability measure
eνλ on C(Rd) whose restriction to C(Bk) coincides with eνk,λ. Defining eΥλ as the continuous random
field with law eνλ on C(Rd), it follows that for all F ∈Cb
loc(C(Rd)), the right-hand side of (4.45) equals
E[F(eΥλ)].

Corollaries and applications
In this section, we gather some results that follow as consequences of those presented in earlier
sections and that will be particularly useful later, especially in Section 7.
We begin with the following lemma.
Lemma 4.19. There exists a constant c > 0 such that for λ > 0, for all L > 0 sufficiently large,
b > 0 sufficiently large, and u ∈[b1/4, b3/4],

Proof. For L > 0, we let k = k(L) be the smallest k ∈[b −1] such that λ + Rk(0) ≥L/4, where
Rk is defined in the statement of Lemma 4.9. We note that, by possibly taking L > 0 large enough,
