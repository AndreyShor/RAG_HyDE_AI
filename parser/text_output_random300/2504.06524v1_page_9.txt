ZERO-ENERGY BAND CROSSINGS PROTECTED BY INVERSION SYMMETRY
In this section, we discuss the relationship between the zero-energy band crossings in Fig. 1(c) and inversion
symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We consider the Bogoliubov–de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian in Eq. (4) of the main

In the absence of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) potential (i.e., λ = 0), the Hamiltonian Hkx,s preserves inversion

This Hamiltonian also preserves particle-hole-like symmetry:

where K denotes the complex conjugation operator, and the operator CP satisﬁes C2
P = +1.
Combining these
symmetries, we ﬁnd CP-like symmetry as:
UCP HT
kx,sU −1
CP = −Hkx,s,
UCP = ΞP ∗= τx,
(25)
where (CP P)2 = UCP U ∗
CP = +1 and hence U T
CP = UCP . Following Refs. [73, 74], we deﬁne a Z2 invariant that
characterizes the zero-energy band crossings in the spectrum of Hkx,s at λ = 0. Since UCP is a symmetric matrix, it
can be decomposed as UCP = V QV T, where Q is a diagonal matrix and V is a unitary matrix. We deﬁne Ω= √Q
†V †,
where √Q is well-deﬁned due to the diagonal nature of Q. Using Ω, we rewrite Eq. (25) as:
Ω∗HT
kx,sΩT = −ΩHkx,sΩ†.
(26)
As a result, we ﬁnd that the transformed Hamiltonian, ˜Hkx,s = ΩHkx,sΩ†, becomes an antisymmetric matrix:
˜HT
kx,s = −˜Hkx,s.
(27)
The antisymmetric nature of ˜Hkx,s allows us to deﬁne a Z2 invariant using its Pfaﬃan:
