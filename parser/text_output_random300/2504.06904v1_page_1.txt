Abstract- 
The 
reconstruction, 
management, 
and 
optimization of gas pipelines is of significant importance 
for solving modern engineering problems. This paper 
presents innovative methodologies aimed at the effective 
reconstruction of gas pipelines under unstable conditions. 
The research encompasses the application of machine 
learning and optimization algorithms, targeting the 
enhancement of system reliability and the optimization of 
interventions during emergencies. The findings of the 
study present engineering solutions aimed at addressing 
the challenges in real-world applications by comparing 
the performance of various algorithms. Consequently, 
this work contributes to the advancement of cutting-edge 
approaches in the field of engineering and opens new 
perspectives for future research. A highly reliable and 
efficient technological Figure has been proposed for 
managing emergency processes in gas transportation 
based on the principles of the reconstruction phase. For 
complex gas pipeline systems, new approaches have been 
investigated for the modernization of existing control 
process monitoring systems. These approaches are based 
on modern achievements in control theory and 
information technology, aiming to select emergency and 
technological modes. One of the pressing issues is to 
develop a method to minimize the transmission time of 
measured and controlled data on non-stationary flow 
parameters of gas networks to dispatcher control centers. 
Therefore, the reporting Figures obtained for creating a 
reliable information base for dispatcher centers using 
modern methods to efficiently manage the gas dynamic 
processes of non-stationary modes are of particular 
importance.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The increasing consumption volumes and resource 
usage to meet the gas demand in the country can be 
ensured not only through the design and construction of 
new networks and structures but also through the 
reconstruction of gas pipelines and efficient management 
by utilizing potential reserves. Gas pipelines play a 
critical role in the energy landscape; however, their 
reconstruction and management are fraught with 
challenges. 
This 
paper 
thoroughly 
examines 
the 
engineering aspects of gas pipeline reconstruction, 
including optimization and management methods. The 
recent application of advanced technologies, particularly 
machine learning, facilitates the resolution of engineering 
problems. Gas pipeline systems are complex systems 
characterized by numerous elements, and managing them 
requires a large amount of information corresponding to 
the number of possible elements. Managing such 
complex gas pipelines is impossible without a systematic 
approach based on the combined consideration of 
complex concepts of control theory, such as system, 
information, 
goal-oriented, 
and 
feedback. 
New 
approaches to reconstruction methods aimed at ensuring a 
higher level of quality are required in managing these 
systems. 
The theory of selecting justified parameters for the 
operation and reconstruction of main gas pipelines 
requires the calculation of non-stationary processes 
resulting from any emergency [19, 20]. This task should 
be considered one of the most pressing issues. The 
operating conditions of a reconstructed gas pipeline must 
ensure its ability to perform specified functions reliably 
for a fixed period. The main purpose of the report Figure 
is to prepare a database in accordance with the 
requirements for the reconstruction and optimization 
technology of gas pipelines. This database can be applied 
to modern smart systems for managing gas supply using 
various methods and processes. It is known that recently, 
machine learning and artificial intelligence systems have 
been present in various fields, including the management 
of gas supply systems.  
A comprehensive analysis of the current state of 
machine learning and artificial intelligence in solving gas 
supply issues has been conducted by several researchers 
[1, 2, 11, 14, 21]. These studies also discuss various types 
of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods 
that can be used to process and interpret data in different 
areas of the oil and gas industry. The use of these modern 
technologies can facilitate the decision-making process in 
the management of gas supply system reconstructions.  
The novelty of the work lies in the development of 
reporting Figures for solving several important new
