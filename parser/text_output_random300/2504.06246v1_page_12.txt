Tunneling conductance G as a function of QPC
gate voltage VQP C and source-drain bias Vsd. The white line
indicates the magnitude of the induced gap, ∆ind = 200 µeV.
quantum point contact gates were tuned to set the high-
bias conductance to ∼0.05G0, where G0 is the quan-
tum conductance. Fig. 9 shows a decrease in the criti-
cal current from 0.88 µA at VT (B)) = 0 V to 0.64 µA
at VT (B) = 0.7 mV. In Ref. [17], a similar reduction
in critical current is reported due to electron injection
from an additional 2DEG lead in ballistic Nb-2DEG-
Nb Josephson junctions, similar to our configuration. In

At B∥=0 T and Vmiddle = −0.7 V , the blue line plots
the junction voltage, VJ, as a function of DC current,IDC,
with VT = 0 V and VB = 0 V. The red dashed line is a
linear fit in the normal region (|IDC| ≥4 µA) used to extract
the excess current, Iexc, and the normal state resistance, RN.
eIexcRN extracted from this linear fit is 564 µeV.
our devices, tunneling currents are injected from the top
and bottom tunneling probes, which behave similarly to
the additional 2DEG lead in Ref. [17]. The authors of
Ref. [17] suggest two mechanisms for this phenomenon:
1) coupling between the Josephson junction and addi-
tional normal contacts (our tunneling probes) leads to
quasiparticle phase breaking and suppression of the net
critical current, 2) electrons injected by DC voltage-
biased contacts occupy previously empty Andreev bound
