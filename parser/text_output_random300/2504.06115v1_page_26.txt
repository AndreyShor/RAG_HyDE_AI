Almost generic nodal octics with Z3-torsion
Our second type of examples are almost generic octic hypersurfaces X3 and X4 in P4
1,1,1,1,4.
They respectively have 104 and 100 isolated nodes and in both cases the torsion is
B(X3) = B(X4) = Z3 .

The geometries are again obtained by using conifold transitions from certain CICY Calabi-
Yau threefolds b
Xr
a, a = 3, 4 as described in Section 2.2.
Now the geometries b
Xr
3 and b
Xr
4 are CICY 7242 and CICY 7237 from the classiﬁcation [43,
44]. The corresponding conﬁguration matrices take the form

In order to understand the geometry behind the conifold transition, it will be useful to ﬁrst
familiarize ourself with the concept of hyperdeterminants.
5.1
Hyperdeterminants from projective duals
We start by considering the Veronese embedding of X = P1 in P2, given by
ν2 : P1 ֒→P2 ,
ν2 : [x1 : x2] 7→[x2
1 : x1x2 : x2
2] .
(5.3)
The projective dual variety X∨is the subvariety in the dual projective space that consists
of the hyperplanes that are tangent to a smooth point of X.
Concretely, we denote the
homogeneous coordinates on the dual projective space by [a1 : a2 : a3] ∈P2 such that the
intersection of the corresponding hyperplane with X is
I = { a1x2
1 + a2x1x2 + a3x2
2 = 0 } ⊂X .
(5.4)
The hyperplane is tangent to X if the quadric is degenerate, i.e. the intersection (5.4) consists
of a single point or X itself. After rewriting
I = {⃗x T A⃗x = 0} ⊂X ,
A =

,
(5.5)
we can identify X∨as the symmetric determinantal variety
X∨= { det A = 0 } ⊂P2 .
(5.6)
The construction generalizes and gives a deﬁnition of the determinant of a symmetric (n +
1) × (n + 1) matrices as the deﬁning equation of the projective dual variety of the Veronese
embedding of Pn in P
