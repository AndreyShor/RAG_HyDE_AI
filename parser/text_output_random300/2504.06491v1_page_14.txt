FIG. 11.
Higher energy inelastic scattering at T=1.7 K (using measurements at a higher incident neutron energy Ei=12 meV)
with correlation model comparisons. (a) Data measured with Ei=3.32 meV and integrated over ℏω = [2.0, 2.5] meV. (b, c)
Contours measured with Ei=12 meV, integrated over ℏω = [4.5, 5.5] meV and ℏω = [7.5, 8.5] meV, respectively; these lack detail
temperature-independent background subtraction. Fits with the model from Fig. 4 for data in (a) yield ρi values [kkn1, kkn2,
kkn3] of [-0.51(2), 0.19(1), 0.25(1)]. For data in (b, c) a model using only three nearest kagome layer correlations [kkn1, kkn2,
kkn3] respectively yield [-0.24(2), 0.13(1), 0.19(2)] and [-0.30(1), 0.11(1), 0.08(2)]. The measured dynamic structure factor from
2 meV up to 8.5 meV is consistent with kagome-kagome pairs with AF nearest neighbor correlations and weaker FM 2nd and
3rd nearest nearest neighbor correlations, consistent with the fits in Fig 4.
