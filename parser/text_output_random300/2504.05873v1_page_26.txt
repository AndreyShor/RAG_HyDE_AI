• Scenario U: Universal lepton coupling ˆgae = ˆgaµ = ˆgaτ ,
where we have introduced the definitions ˆgaℓ≡gaℓ/mℓor ˆgaℓ≡Cℓ/Λ for the pseudoscalar
or the derivative case, respectively. For each scenario, we consider both derivative and
pseudoscalar couplings and set all other ALP couplings to zero. All bounds are calculated
at 90% confidence level, except the ones from LEP and W + →e+νa, which are at 95%
confidence level.

Effect of the coupling type on the E137 bound
Before presenting our full results, we compare the effect of the choice of coupling type
on the bounds derived from the E137 experiment. The comparisons of the bounds for all
scenarios are shown in figure 9.
In this figure, aside from comparing the derivative coupling given in eq. (2.1) and the
pseudoscalar coupling in eq. (2.4), we also show a comparison with a simplifying approxi-
mation, in which the effective off-shell coupling of the ALP to photons is set to the constant
on-shell value, in order to judge the relevance of the momentum dependence of the effective
photon coupling. We approximate the couplings according to the limits of the derivative
and pseudoscalar couplings given in eqs. (2.17) and (2.18), respectively. Since the ALP
mass is larger than that of the electron in the most relevant regions of parameter space,
we assume τe = 4m2
e/m2
a ≪1. For the muon and tau contribution, on the other hand,
we can approximate τµ,τ ≫1 in the parameter regions probed by E137. In the on-shell
approximation, we thus approximate the derivative coupling by the constant values

Specifically, in the approximation for the case of pseudoscalar couplings to electrons only,
we set the loop-induced coupling to photons to zero and consider only the tree-level con-
tribution from electrons. For Scenario U, we also consider a simplified tree-level model of
ALPs, where we set all effective loop-induced photon couplings to zero in order to estimate
their relevance for the final exclusion bounds.
Beginning with Scenario E in the top-left panel of figure 9, one can see the bounds on
the derivative coupling, the pseudoscalar one and their respective constant approximations.
