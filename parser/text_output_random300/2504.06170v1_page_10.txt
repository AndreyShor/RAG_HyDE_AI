Figure 1. (a) Spitzer 8 µm image of an area ∼0.◦39 × 0.◦31, centered at (l, b) = (33.◦26, −0.◦02), covering the IRDC associated
with the bubble N59-North. The filamentary IRDC is marked with cyan arrows, while the bubbles N59 and N59-North are
outlined by large and small ellipses, respectively. The orange contours present MAGPIS 20 cm radio continuum emission at
levels [5, 8, 10 and 15] ×σ, with 1σ = 0.4 mJy beam−1. The inset shows a zoomed-in view of the yellow rectangular region
outlined over the IRDC. Blue contours indicate MeerKAT 1.3 GHz continuum emission at levels [5, 15 and 25] ×σ, with 1σ = 20
µJy beam−1. The position of the ATLASGAL clump (from Urquhart et al. (2018)) is shown with black star symbol. The IR-
dark filaments are highlighted by yellow dotted lines in the inset. (b) Same image as panel “a” for the magenta dotted-dashed
rectangular region. The position of the IRDC candidates toward the filament obtained from Pari & Hora (2020) is marked using
asterisk symbols. (c) GRS 13CO(J = 1–0) integrated intensity (moment-0) map for the velocity range of [94.5, 107.3] km s−1.
For the moment-0 map 1σ = 0.21 K km s−1. The black and magenta star symbols indicate the position of the ATLASGAL
clumps with and without signature of outflow activity, respectively. The ellipse corresponding to N59-North is highlighted in
panels “b” and “c.” A scale bar of 2 pc is provided in the inset of panel “a,” while a 15 pc scale bar is shown in each panel for
a distance of 4.66 kpc.
