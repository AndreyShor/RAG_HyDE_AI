Figure 3.20: The variation in the 4FNS total (left) and valence (right) charm PDFs at Q = 1.65 GeV as
the W 2 cut is raised to 20 GeV2 in steps of 2.5 GeV2 (top) and the Q2 cut is raised to 5 GeV2 (bottom).
The kinematic cuts in the baseline fit are Q2 ≥3.5 GeV2 and W 2 ≥12.5 GeV2.
The 3FNS and 4FNS valence PDFs turn out to be quite close, implying that for the valence PDF,
unlike for the total charm PDF, the theory uncertainty is smaller than the PDF uncertainty. We
thus find that the intrinsic (3FNS) charm valence is nonzero and positive roughly in the same x
region as its 4FNS counterpart.
The statistical significance of the non-vanishing valence is quantified by the pull, defined as the
median PDF in units of the total uncertainty, shown in Fig. 3.21 (right). The local significance
of the intrinsic valence is slightly below two sigma, peaking at x ∼0.3. The significance of the
total intrinsic component is similar to that found in Ref. [1] (cf. Fig. 3.13), namely about three
sigma for x ∼0.5. As in the previous sections, we also show the results found in fit variants
including the EMC F c
2 and LHCb Z + c data [248], both of which increase the local significance.
The results of Figs. 3.15 and 3.21 suggest that the intrinsic valence component may be nonzero,
but their significance falls below the three sigma evidence level. In the next section, we
thus propose two novel experimental observables engineered to probe this valence charm
component.
