Local structure of extremal points

Proof. We do not provide a detailed proof of this lemma, as it closely follows that of Lemma 4.22.
Instead, we outline the necessary modifications to that proof.
First, in the regime log rη ≥b/2, we can proceed exactly as in the proof of Lemma 4.22. Regarding
the regime log rη < b/2, it suffices to use Lemma 4.11 in place of Lemma 4.10 to restrict to the event
{Kb < log rη}. Similarly, we obtain that the probability on the left-hand side of (4.6) is bounded
above by a multiple of b−1/2√P(E1), when b ≥0 is large enough.
Hence, it remains to bound P0,u,b(E2) appearing on the left-hand side of the first line in (4.66). To this
end, arguing as in the proof of [BL18, Lemma 4.16] and using (A.2), we observe that the probability
on the right-hand side of the second line in (4.66) can be bounded from above by
P0,u,b
b−1
\
j=1
{Bj ≥−λ −2Rlog rη(j)}

≲P0,u,b

inf
s∈[0,b] Bs ≳−(log b)2

≲b−5/8 ,
where, to derive the last inequality, we used the fact that u ≤b1/4. Finally, since we are in the regime
log rη < b/2, it follows that b−5/8 is at most a multiple of b−1/2η−1/(8d). Combining this with the
bound in (4.68) completes the proof of (4.69). To conclude, we note that (4.70) follows immediately
from (4.69).
Finally, we also have the following result.
Lemma 4.28. For λ > 0 and for b > 0 sufficiently large, it holds that
E0,u,b[|Dλ
0,b(Υb,g)|−1] ≲
(
bd2 ,
if u ∈[b3/4, b2d] ,
(u/b)2d ,
if u > b2d .
Proof. We begin by recalling that, for r > 0, the quantity Sr is defined in (4.56). Furthermore, we
also recall that, thanks to Remark 4.25, for all η > 0, it holds that
P0,u,b(|Dλ
0,b(Υb,g)|−1 ≥η) ≤P0,u,b(Seb > cλη2/d) ,
for some constant cλ > 0 depending only on λ. We divide the proof into two disjoint cases.
Case 1: We begin by considering the case u ∈[b3/4, b2d]. In this case, using Lemma 4.26, there exist
constants c1, c2, c3 > 0 such that, for any b > 0 sufficiently large,
E0,u,b[|Dλ
0,b(Υb,g)|−1] ≤bd2 +
Z ∞
bd2 P0,u,b(Seb > cλη2/d)dη
≲bd2 + edb
Z ∞
bd2 ec1 u
b η2/d−c2η4/ddη
≲bd2 + edb
Z ∞
bd2 e−c3η4/ddη ≲bd2 .
Case 2: We now focus on the case u > b2d. Proceeding similarly to the previous case, we obtain that
there exist constants c1, c2, c3 > 0 such that, for any b > 0 sufficiently large,
E0,u,b[|Dλ
0,b(Υb,g)|−1] ≲(u/b)2d + edb
Z ∞
(u/b)2d ec1 u
b η2/d−c2η4/ddη
≲(u/b)2d + edb
Z ∞
(u/b)2d e−c3η4/ddη ≲(u/b)2d ,
which completes the proof.
