temperature-induced relative frequency shifts are on the order of 1 × 10−5 for all resonant
modes (from 15 mK to 600 mK in Fig. S3), whereas the laser-induced shifts are on the
order of 1 × 10−4 (Fig. S5). In other words, even at higher temperatures (T ∼hfr/kB),
the laser-induced effects have a larger impact on the resonance frequencies than do the
temperature-induced changes in the TLS states. These differences indicate that the laser-
induced changes in the environment are distinct from those resulting from an equilibrium
temperature increase. The origin of the larger changes in the laser irradiation experiments
is attributed to the increase of the number of TLS interacting with the resonator.
Microwave and Optical Power Dependence of the Resonance Frequency
We also investigate the microwave power dependence of the relative frequency shift to
consider the effects of TLS saturation by high-power microwaves.
Figure S6 shows the
laser-induced frequency shifts measured at different probe microwave powers. The highest
power used, −77 dBm, is considered to be approximately the TLS saturation power. The
upward frequency shift remains unchanged as the microwave power decreases. Thus, the
microwave-induced saturation do not have much impact for our result.
Derivation of the Permittivity of TLS
In this section, we briefly summarize the relationship between the real and imaginary
parts of the complex permittivity arising from TLS [2, 12], which is important for the
