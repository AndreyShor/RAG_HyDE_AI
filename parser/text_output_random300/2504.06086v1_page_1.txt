ABSTRACT
We present direct metric-decimetric radio imaging observations of a fascinating quiescent filament
eruption on 2024 March 17 using data from the DAocheng Radio Telescope (DART), with a combina-
tion of the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Chinese Hα Solar Explorer. At the radio band, even
though the filament is difficult to identify in its early phase, it rapidly became distinct and formed a
continuous loop-like dark structure during the eruption, i.e., so-called radio depression. Compared with
the fragmentation of the erupting filament observed at the Hα and EUV bands, the radio depression
appeared more coherently. Based on synthetic radio images from a three-dimensional magnetohydro-
dynamics (MHD) simulation of a flux-rope-filament eruption, it is suggested that the radio depression
originates from the absorption of cold and dense materials within the erupting flux rope to the back-
ground emission. The absorption seems to be stronger than that at the Hα and EUV bands, thus
leading to their apparent discrepancies. Moreover, the radio depression is also found to occupy the
lower part but not the whole body of the flux rope.

1. INTRODUCTION
Solar filaments are cold and dense plasma suspended in the hot and tenuous corona. They typically appear as
absorption features against a bright background as seen on the solar disk. Filaments alternatively appear as bright
structures, known as prominences, when observed above the solar limb (for a review, see Parenti 2014). Numerous
studies support the idea that the filament is typically a collection of cool materials at the dips of sheared arcades or a
magnetic flux rope (MFR), the latter of which is a twisted flux rope with helical field lines wrapped around a common
axis (e.g., Aulanier & Demoulin 1998; Guo et al. 2010; Xia et al. 2012; Jiang et al. 2014).
Filaments may erupt suddenly and give rise to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), thus being of great significance for
predicting space weather (Schmieder et al. 2002; Gopalswamy et al. 2003; Parenti 2014). White-light coronagraph
observations show that CMEs often display a three-part component structure including the bright core, dark cavity,
and bright front, the former two of which are believed to correspond to the erupting filament and the whole flux rope
structure, respectively (Illing & Hundhausen 1985; Webb & Hundhausen 1987; Vourlidas et al. 2013). Due to the great
visibility of filaments at multi-wavelengths such as extreme UV (EUV), Hα, and white light, their kinematics have
also been extensively studied for the sake of uncovering the initiation and early evolution of CMEs (e.g., Heinzel et al.
2001; Cheng et al. 2013; McCauley et al. 2015; Song et al. 2019; Cheng et al. 2020; Song et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2023).
Despite filaments having been observed for decades, radio imaging observations of filament eruptions, particularly
at the metric and decimetric wavebands, remain rather rare (for a brief review see Alissandrakis 2020). Using Nan¸cay
Radioheliograph (NRH) data, Marqu´e et al. (2002) reported a depression structure appearing at 410.5 MHz and
found that it showed a significant discrepancy with the filament as seen at the 304 ˚A. Subsequently, Marqu´e (2004)
performed a systematic study on the nature of filament-related radio depressions and proposed that the depressions
corresponded to a dark cavity surrounding the filament, where the plasma density was relatively low. On the other
