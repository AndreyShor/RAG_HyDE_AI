of notation, we denote this restricted (N + 1) Ã— (N + 1) matrix by Hs
N, and, as before, normalize it by
the factor 1/N, yielding Â¯Hs
N. This restricted matrix represents a single quantum spin system with spin
quantum number J = N/2, a setting commonly analyzed in the classical limit J â†’âˆž[20, 28]. Specifically,
the matrix aligns with the choice J = N/2 in (3.8). As demonstrated in the proof of Theorem 2, the
resulting family of matrices { Â¯Hs

to the case u = 1 in (3.6).
Remark 2. By making the following change of variables
cos Ï‘ 7â†’2x âˆ’1;
Ï† 7â†’Î¸ := Ï† âˆ’Ï€,
it follows that the symbol (for u = 1) reads

In the sequel, we step-by-step prove that the Berezin-Topelitz operator Â¯Hs
N is indeed a GLT sequence. For
achieving this, we recall that there exists a basis in which Â¯Hs
N is represented by the following matrix

as proven in [31].
Theorem 3. With reference to the setting in (4.1) and (4.2), we have
{ Â¯Hs
N}N âˆ¼GLT,Ïƒ,Î» hCW
0
(x, Ï†(Î¸)).
Proof. By considering d = r = 1 it is immediate to see that the matrix Â¯Hs
N can be written as the sum of
diagonal sampling matrices as in Section 2.3 and two products of sampling matrices and very basic unilevel
Toeplitz matrices as in Section 2.2. In fact we have

N = âˆ’Î“

Now by Axiom GLT 2.1 we have {TN+1(eÂ±Î¹Î¸)}N âˆ¼GLT eÂ±Î¹Î¸ and by Axiom GLT 2.2 we deduce

(1 âˆ’x)x,
simply because both functions (2x âˆ’1)2 , âˆš1 âˆ’xâˆšx are continuous on [0, 1] and a fortiori Riemann inte-
grable.
Hence by using the âˆ—-algebra structure of the GLT sequences and more precisely Axiom GLT 3.2, Axiom
GLT 3.3, we infer { Â¯Hs
