Figure 16: The confusion matrix of protocol identification
on synthetic dataset at SNR 10dB.
Figure 17 presents the classification confusion matrices on over-
the-air signals, despite neither model being trained on such data. T-
Prime demonstrates limited generalization, particularly with DVB-
S2 headers. At𝑟= 0.83, where signal recovery error is relatively low,
its classification accuracy for DVB-S2 drops to around 90%. This
issue is pronounced at 𝑟= 0.625, where increased recovery errors
reduce its accuracy to approximately 58%. In contrast, SigChord
exhibits robust generalization across all sampling rates. It achieves
over 99% accuracy in identifying each category at 𝑟= 0.83, and
over 88% accuracy in recognizing DVB-S2 headers at 𝑟= 0.625.
The protocol identification model can achieve high performance
and real-time processing at the same time. Setting the inference
batch size to 1,024, SigChord processes one batch in 45.3 ± 0.4ms,
averaging 44.23𝜇s per sample. By organizing the spectrum sensing,
signal recovery and protocol identification model as a pipeline,
those wide multiband signal analysis tasks can be completed in
real-time on a consumer-level GPU. These analysis results along
with recovered signals can be further forwarded to downstream
modules.

Header Decoding
This section evaluates the header decoding performance of Sig-
Chord on DVB-S2, IEEE 802.11g/b non-HT Wi-Fi and IEEE 802.11n
HT Wi-Fi signals, assuming the protocol headers are identified
correctly. With seconds of fine-tuning on 1,000 data points for 5
epochs, we show the decoding accuracy on over-the-air signals.
The decoding accuracies of each bit in the headers are shown in
Figure 18. SigChord demonstrates exceptionally high decoding accu-
racy across various protocol fields at 𝑟= 0.83, with MCS prediction
accuracy exceeding 99% for all three protocol types. For DVB-S2,
frame length and payload pilot format parameters are decoded with
99.9% accuracy, while the channel bandwidth for HT Wi-Fi reaches
99.7% accuracy. Additionally, SigChord excels in decoding Non-HT
Wi-Fi packet length and HT Wi-Fi transmission duration fields, as
shown in Table 3 and Figure 19. Specifically, for Non-HT Wi-Fi,
SigChord decodes packet length with zero error for at least 95%
of packets, achieving an average packet length prediction error of
only 0.014KB. Similarly, it predicts transmission time with zero
error for at least 95% of packets, with an average prediction error
of just 13.57𝜇s.
