any rate, even if there is a global anomaly, it might be possible to cancel it with a topological
Green-Schwarz mechanism, see [54].
In the following Subsections, we will perform similar analysis to this one for other excep-
tional groups. Let us advance that, with the restriction that the dimensions of all representa-
tions are below 248, and allowing for any chirality, we have not found analogous (non)-chiral
solutions to (3.12) and (3.13)for any of the other exceptional groups; we did not extend the
search to the infinite series of algebras A, B, C, D due to computational complexity. Thus,
among the exceptional groups, the solution (3.21) is quite unique. Whether this is because
our search was somewhat limited or because (3.21) does correspond to a new solution in
M-theory remains to be seen.

F4 gauge group
We continue our discussion with F4. In this case, there are only three representations with
dimension below 248. We have found only one solution, listed in table 2, with all fields having
the same chirality. This solution can be connected to the E8 wall out one of the branchings
we have already mentioned for G2, namely E8 ⊃G2 × F4. No new solutions appear when the
same set of fields is considered but both chiralities are allowed (possibly, due to the smaller
number of representations with dimensions below 248). Therefore, there are no new boundary
conditions in this case either.

E6 gauge group
Next, we discuss E6 gauge theory.
The results are displayed in table 3.
Notice that all
solutions feature fermions in a real representation; this is the case in dimensions 2 modulo 8
since a given representation R is physically equivalent to its Majoranana conjugate [55].
We found a single solution (and we scanned for both positive and negative chirality
representations), which can be found in table 3 and is related to the branching E8 ⊃E6 ×
SU(3). This is the unique embedding of SU(3) in E8, so again, we only find the (branching
of the) Hoˇrava-Witten solution. Finally, note also that the anomaly polynomial of F4 is the
same as in this case. This is explained by the fact that 27 →26 ⊕1 under E6 ⊃F4.
