Lorentz force term will contain the 𝑥-coordinate. This section aims to derive an analytical
solution for this pattern. It is not difficult to determine that the velocity in the main flow region
𝑈must be a linear function of the tangential coordinate 𝑥, implying 𝑘= 1. This phenomenon
is referred to as stagnation point flow (Fang 2019). Consequently, the momentum equation
is simplified as

This text will first present an analytical solution for a nonlinear partial differential equation
applicable to various multi-physical field parameters. However, in extreme cases, where there
is a significant difference between the pressure and the Lorentz force, this non-linear equation
can be simplified to a linear equation. The analytical solution in this scenario will provide
deeper insight into the spatiotemporal characteristics of the boundary layer.
3.1. General Solution under Arbitrary Magnetic Field
Performing a two-order Taylor expansion of the two nonlinear terms in the momentum
equation near the boundary, in conjunction with the non-penetration and non-slip boundary
conditions, results in the following equations

𝜕𝜂2 = ( 𝑓|𝜂=0 + 𝜕𝑓

(3.3)
Where 𝑑is a geometric small quantity relative to the boundary layer scale. So two nonlinear
terms can be reduced to a single square term within the region near the wall. For the sake of
convenience in the derivation process, it is reasonable to set 𝛽= 1. It is noteworthy that 𝜎𝐵2
𝜌𝑊
corresponds to the Stuart number 𝑁(Turkyilmazoglu 2012). The momentum equation can
be further simplified as follows
𝜕3 𝑓
𝜕𝜂3 −𝜕2 𝑓
𝜕𝜂𝜕𝜏−1
2 ( 𝜕𝑓
𝜕𝜂)2 + 1 = 2𝑁( 𝜕𝑓
𝜕𝜂−1)
(3.4)
Based on the idea of substitution, taking 2𝑁as the proportional coefficient of 𝑓𝐿, the final
simplified form of momentum equation can be obtained
𝜕3𝑔
𝜕𝜂3 −𝜕2𝑔
𝜕𝜂𝜕𝜏−1
2 ( 𝜕𝑔
𝜕𝜂)2 + 1 + 2𝑁+ 2𝑁2 = 0
(3.5)
Where nonlinear function 𝑔= 𝑓+ 2𝑁𝜂. The mathematical form of this partial differential
equation is analogous to the Falkner-Skan equation (Zhang et al. 2011), with the distinction
being the time-varying term. A closed analytical solution can be expressed as
𝑔(𝜂, 𝜏) = 𝑐3𝑏tanh(𝑐1𝑏𝜂+ 𝑐2𝑏𝜏+ 𝑐𝑏) −𝑐4𝑏ln cosh(𝑐1𝑏𝜂+ 𝑐2𝑏𝜏+ 𝑐𝑏) + ℎ(𝜏)
(3.6)
ℎ(𝜏) = −𝑐3𝑏tanh(𝑐2𝑏𝜏+ 𝑐𝑏) + 𝑐4𝑏ln cosh(𝑐2𝑏𝜏+ 𝑐𝑏)
(3.7)
By thoroughly matching the powers of tanh, exact solutions for each coefficient of every
term can be easily obtained. It is important to note that the only parameter currently
undetermined is 𝑐𝑏.
