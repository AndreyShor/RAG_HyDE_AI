In this work, we report transport studies of a high quality tMoTe2 device with a twist 
angle of 3.83°±0.03°, corresponding to a moiré density 𝑛𝑛M ≈ 4.2 × 1012 cm−2 and a 
moiré lattice constant 𝑎𝑎M ≈ 5.2 nm. Simply by electrostatic gating, we have realized 
IQAH state, multiple FQAH states, RIQAH states, and superconductivity within the 
first moiré Chern band of tMoTe2.  
 
Transport phase diagram of high quality 3.83° tMoTe2 device 
To improve the device quality, single crystals of 2H-MoTe2 were grown by the flux 
method, with reduced defect densities and improved carrier mobility (Methods and 
Extended Data Fig. 1). Twisted MoTe2 devices were made following the same 
procedures as described in our previous studies [4,49] (Methods). Figure 1a shows the 
schematic of the device structure. The top and bottom graphite gates are used to 
independently control the νh and the vertical electric displacement field D. Electrical 
contacts are achieved by using 2D metal 2H-TaSe2 together with Si/SiO2 gate to induce 
heavily hole-doping in contact regions. The twist angle of the device is calibrated 
through quantum oscillations observed under high magnetic fields (Extended Data Fig. 
2). 
 
Figure 1c shows the longitudinal resistivity ρxx as a function of D and νh at temperature 
T = 2 K and zero magnetic field. At νh = 1, 2/3, and 3/5, local dips in ρxx can be identified 
around D = 0, corresponding to the IQAH state at νh = 1 and FQAH states at νh = 2/3, 
3/5, consistent with previous studies [3,4]. The applied D-field can drive the quantum 
anomalous Hall states into topologically trivial, correlated insulating states at νh = 1 and 
2/3. Additionally, correlated insulators are also observed at νh = 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and 1/8, 
under finite D-fields. The νh = 1/4 and 1/8 correlated insulating states have not been 
previously reported in tMoTe2, possibly due to device quality limitations. Figure 1d 
shows a similar ρxx-νh-D map measured at a lower temperature, T = 900 mK. The main 
features remain similar to those observed at T = 2 K, but become more pronounced. 
Additionally, at T = 0.9 K and around D = 0, ρxx dips associated with the νh = 4/7 FQAH 
state and ρxx peaks of correlated insulators at νh = 3/2 and 4/3 begin to develop, 
becoming more prominent at lower temperatures (Fig. 1e). The νh = 4/7 FQAH state 
has been recently reported by local scanning SQUID measurements [6], while the 
correlated insulators at νh = 3/2 and 4/3 have not been reported previously.  
 
Figures 1e and 1f show ρxx and Hall resistivity ρxy, respectively, as a function of νh and 
D at T = 100 mK. ρxx and ρxy have been symmetrized and anti-symmetrized using data 
measured under perpendicular magnetic field B = ±0.1 T. In comparison to the 900 mK 
ρxx-νh-D map, several intriguing new features emerge at low temperatures: 1) Between 
the νh = 2/3 and 3/5 FQAH states, another state emerges, characterized by vanishing ρxx
