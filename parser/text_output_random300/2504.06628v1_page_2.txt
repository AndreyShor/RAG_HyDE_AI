Equality (2) and inequality (3) imply that we can con-
trol entropy production ∆stot via changing active fluctu-
ations.
In the absence of active fluctuations, Eq. (2) and in-
equality (3) reduce to the conventional integral fluctu-
ation theorem (FT) and second law of thermodynamics
(SL) (e.g., Ref. [42]), respectively. We note that the FT
and SL for Gaussian systems in previous studies were
mostly based on physical arguments, although providing
valuable insights into nonequilibrium thermodynamics,
yet certain elements in these derivations—such as the
construction of the time-reversed process—are not well
treated with full mathematical rigor. Here, our results
are not only applicable to systems with non-Gaussian ac-
tive fluctuations but also offer a rigorous mathematical
approach to resolve the aforementioned inconsistencies in
systems driven solely by Gaussian thermal noise.
Finally,
we
introduce
an
efficient
computational
method based on a L´evy score particle algorithm for
calculating entropy production in active systems [43].
This approach allows us to compute various entropy
production components (∆Stot, ∆Sact, ∆Ssys, ∆Sm),
thereby facilitating the analysis of stochastic thermody-
namic properties in systems with non-Gaussian active
fluctuations. Moreover, we adapt our deep learning algo-
rithm to a range of dynamical scenarios, demonstrating
its robustness and effectiveness in capturing the nonequi-
librium characteristics of active matter.
Model—In Euclidean space Rd, we consider the over-
damped dynamics of a single particle driven by a force
F (r) = −∇U(r)+f(r), where the first and second term
denote conservative and non-conservative part, respec-
tively. The motion is described by Langevin equation:
dr(t)/ dt = F (r(t))/Γ + ηth(t) + ηact(t),
(4)
where Γ is the friction coefficient, ηth(t) and ηact(t) are
the thermal and active noise, respectively. The thermal
noise ηth is a Gaussian white noise with zero mean and
variance ⟨ηth,i(t)ηth,j(t′)⟩= 2Dthδi,jδ(t −t′), where Dth
is the diffusion coefficient and the indices i, j = 1, 2, . . . , d
denote spatial directions. The diffusion and friction coef-
ficients satisfy the Einstein relation Dth = kBT /Γ, where
T denotes the bath temperature, to hold the fluctuation-
dissipation theorem for thermal noise. The active noise
ηact is modeled as the compound Poisson process (also
known as Poissonian shot noise) which consists of discrete
“kicks” occurring at a rate λ0, and is expressed as:
ηact,i(t) =
Nt
X
k=1
Ak,iδ(t −tk),
(5)
where the times tk are distributed according to a Poisson
process with rate λ0; the total number of kicks Nt in the
interval [0, t] follows a Poisson distribution with mean
λ0t; the kick amplitudes Ak,i are independent and iden-
tically distributed random variables drawn from a fixed
probability distribution with intensity νA. The associ-
ated L´evy measure ν of this active noise process is given
by ν = λ0νA, which is a probability measure on Rd.
The L´evy–Fokker–Planck equation corresponding to
Eq. (4) reads [43, 44]

The common definition of a nonequilibrium Gibbs en-

(7)
suggests to define a trajectory-dependent entropy for the
system
ssys(t) = −log P(r(t), t),
(8)
where the probability P(r, t) obtained by solving the
L´evy–Fokker–Planck equation (6) is evaluated along the
stochastic trajectory r(t). Obviously, for any given tra-
jectory r(t), the stochastic entropy ssys depends on the
given initial data P0(r) and thus contains information
on the whole ensemble. The definition (8) has been used
previously by Crooks for stochastic microscopically re-
versible dynamics [45], by Qian for stochastic dynam-
ics of macromolecules [46], and by Seifert for stochas-
tic nonequilibrium dynamics [42].
All of these works,
however, only discussed Gaussian fluctuations for this
stochastic entropy.
