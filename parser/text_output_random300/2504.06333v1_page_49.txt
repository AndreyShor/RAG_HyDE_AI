An explicit example:
In this subsection, we would like to identify the ‘right part’ of the club sandwich
aka reduced topological order following [9].
Z′ = Z/A
for the speciﬁc case of Vec(Z4). The anyons in the Drinfeld center for Vec(Z4) are
given by
Z = {eimj,
i,j = 0,1,2,3}.
The Hom space for Z = Vec(Z4) is
HomZ(eimj,ekml) = {C
(i = k,j = l
mod 4),
0
otherwise.
(A.1)
In order to ﬁnd the consistent fusion algebra F, where the chosen condensable
algebra A is the vacuum of the condensed theory F.
HomF([eimj],[ekml]) = HomZ(eimj,ekml ⊗A).
(A.2)
Choosing A = Ae = 1 ⊕e2 as our condensable algebra,
HomF([eimj],[ekml]) = HomZ(eimj,ekml ⊗Ae),
= HomZ(eimj,ekml) ⊕HomZ(eimj,ek+2ml),
(A.3)
which implies,
HomF([eimj],[ekml]) = {C
(i = k
mod 2,j = l
mod 4),
0
otherwise.
