approximation. The NLOQCD corrections in the decay decrease the result by 19% relative to
LOQCD.
The complete NLOEW corrections to HH production were presented in Ref. [638]. The
electroweak corrections are found to reduce the cross section by around 4% and induce a large
15% enhancement near the HH production threshold. Results for the NLOEW corrections in
the HTL were presented in Ref. [639]. In Ref. [640], the yt-enhanced piece of the EW corrections
was studied in the HTL, and it is found that the corrections amount to around 0.2%, and are not
well described by introducing an effective trilinear-Higgs coupling. Ref. [641] presents results
for the y2
t corrections in a high-energy expansion. Refs. [642] presents results for corrections
proportional to the triple and quartic Higgs couplings and studies their impact in a modified-κ
framework. Ref. [643] presents results for the yt, triple and quartic Higgs corrections. These
corrections are found to enhance the cross section by 1% with a large enhancement near to
the HH production threshold, similar to that present in the complete NLOEW corrections of
Ref. [638].
Work towards the NNLOQCD corrections has started, with results available in the large
top quark mass expansion for the virtual [622] and real corrections [644,645]. The light-fermion
(nF ) piece is also known in a small-t expansion [646], while the reducible contribution is known
in an expansion about small gluon virtuality or small Higgs boson mass [647].
In Ref. [648] the quark mass corrections to the gg →HH virtual amplitude were studied
at high-energy, it was argued that the dominant part of the mass scheme uncertainty could be
understood and removed.
Higher-order corrections have also been computed in both the HEFT and SMEFT frame-
works, see Ref. [649] for a recent review.
The experimental limits on HH production are currently at the level of approximately
four times the SM cross section for ATLAS [604] (with an expected limit of 5.7) based on a data
sample of 139 fb−1. The observed (expected) constraints on the Higgs boson trilinear coupling
modifier κλ are determined to be [−1.5, 6.7] ([−2.4, 7.7]) at 95% confidence level, where the
expected constraints on κλ are obtained excluding pp →HH production from the background
hypothesis. For CMS, a 95% CL limit of 3.9 times the Standard Model has been obtained [650],
with an expected limit of 7.9, for a data sample of 138 fb−1. Constraints have also been set on
the modifiers of the Higgs field self-coupling κλ with this measurement in the range of −2.3 to
9.4, with an expected range of −5.0 to 12.0. With a data sample of 3000 fb−1, it is projected
that a limit of 0.5 < λhhh/λhhh,SM < 1.5 can be achieved at the 68% CL for ATLAS and CMS
combined [509].

LH21 status: Fully differential results for VBF HH production are known at NNLO(VBF∗)
QCD
[305]
and at N3LO(VBF∗)
QCD
for the inclusive cross section [651]. The non-factorisable NNLOQCD contri-
butions [556] and NLOEW corrections are known [652] and have been combined.

LH21 status: Known at NNLOHTL [653,654], finite quark mass effects are included by reweight-
ing with the full Born result.
Triple production provides a direct handle on the quartic coupling of the Higgs boson,
although very suppressed with respect to single and double Higgs production in the Standard
Model, it can be enhanced in BSM scenarios. It is therefore interesting to begin placing exper-
imental constraints on this process. For an overview of ongoing theoretical and experimental
