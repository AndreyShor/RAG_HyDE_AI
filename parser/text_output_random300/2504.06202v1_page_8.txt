Proof. By the Schwarz reflection principle, we can extend f to a bijective conformal map from
D = C \ (K ∪{¯z | z ∈K}) to f(D). The lemma then follows from Koebe 1/4 theorem applied to
D and the extended map f.
We will need the following result from [3] (2002), which establishes ξ2 as the interior two-arm
exponent for SLEκ. A version of this result was first established in [3, Proposition 4] in the upper
half-plane, but later we will in fact use the following version for general domains.
Proposition 2.2 (Corollary 5, [3]). Let D ⊊C be a simply connected domain, and a, b be two points
on ∂D. Fix κ ∈(0, 8). Let η be an SLEκ in D from a to b. For all z ∈D and ε < d(z, ∂D)/2, we
have, as ε →0,
P(η ∩Bε(z) ̸= ∅) ≍

ε
d(z, ∂D)
ξ2(κ)
(ωz(ab) ∧ωz(ba))ξ+
2 (κ),
where ωz is the harmonic measure on ∂D seen from z, and ab is the positively oriented arc from a
to b along ∂D.
We will also need the following result from [34] (2007), which establishes ξ+
2 as the boundary
two-arm exponent for SLEκ.
The statement that we cite below follows immediately from [34,
Lemma 2.1, Lemma 2.2 and Proposition 2.3].
Proposition 2.3 ([34]). Fix κ ∈(0, 8). Let η be an SLEκ in H from 0 to ∞. For x > 0, as ε →0,
P(η ∩Bε(x) ̸= ∅) ≍(ε/x)ξ+
2 (κ).
We now recall two theorems from [45, 46] on the Green’s function of 2-SLE. The original
statements contain more properties, but we only state two simplified versions which are enough for
our purpose. In the two theorems below, let D be a simply connected domain with four distinct
boundary points (prime ends) a1, b1, a2, b2 such that a1 and a2 together separate b1 from b2 on
∂D. Let (η1, η2) be a 2-SLEκ in D with link pattern (a1, b1; a2, b2). More precisely, this means
that (η1, η2) is distributed as a pair of independent SLE’s in D (ηi between ai and bi, for i = 1, 2)
conditioned not to intersect each other.
Theorem 2.4 (Theorem 1.1, [45]). Let κ ∈(0, 8). Let z0 ∈D. There exists G(κ; D; a1, b1; a2, b2; z0) ∈
(0, ∞) such that as ε →0,
P [dist(z0, ηi) < ε, i = 1, 2] = G(κ; D; a1, b1; a2, b2; z0)εξ4(1 + o(1)).
Theorem 2.5 (Theorem 1.1, [46]). Let κ ∈(0, 4]. Let z0 ∈∂D \ {a1, b1, a2, b2} such that ∂D is
analytic near z0. There exists eG(κ; D; a1, b1; a2, b2) ∈(0, ∞) such that as ε →0,
P [dist(z0, ηi) < ε, i = 1, 2] = eG(κ; D; a1, b1; a2, b2; z0)εξ+
4 (1 + o(1)).
The following lemma states that an SLEκ has a positive probability to stay in a given tube.
Lemma 2.6. Fix κ ∈(0, 4]. Suppose that η is an SLEκ in D from a ∈∂D \ {1} to 1. Let γ be
a simple curve starting from a, terminating at 1, and otherwise not hitting ∂D. Let Aε be the ε
neighborhood of γ. We have P[η ⊂Aε] > 0.
