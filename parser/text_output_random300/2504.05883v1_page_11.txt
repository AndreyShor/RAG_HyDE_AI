monitoring was conducted using our dedicated multi-UAV multi-tasking platform [23], as illustrated in Fig. 5(c). While this
prototype implementation was not optimal, it successfully demonstrated the proposed approach’s effectiveness and revealed
limitations and areas for future improvement. Notably, reliance on GPS positioning introduced errors and inconsistencies in UAV
localization, resulting in distorted coverage plans in certain cases. Additionally, communication delays due to network latency
affected the UAVs’ operation, and environmental disturbances caused deviations from the planned trajectories. Finally, with the
current prototype implementation, we were unable to evaluate the real-time capabilities of the proposed controller or thoroughly
assess its performance in real-world scenarios. For future work, we aim to co-design the software and hardware components of
the proposed controller to facilitate its deployment on real-world platforms. Promising avenues for further research include the
development of efficient real-time mixed-integer programming (MIP) controllers via adaptive neighborhood search techniques
[24], and learning-based approaches [25].
VI. WAY FORWARD IN UAV SWARM SYSTEMS
Swarm systems have the potential to revolutionize society, the economy, technology, and various other fields by enhancing
efficiency, scalability, and adaptability across a wide range of applications. In emergency response, swarms of autonomous
drones and ground vehicles can cooperatively patrol [26] and search areas not previously encountered, locate victims, gather
real-time information, and execute complex missions with minimal human oversight, thereby enhancing situational awareness
and operational capabilities. Meanwhile, in military contexts, swarm technologies have the potential to create coordinated
defense mechanisms for surveillance and reconnaissance. These fields exemplify the potential of swarm system technologies
in tackling complex challenges across diverse sectors through the application of collective intelligence principles. However,
despite recent progress in various aspects of swarming systems [27]–[29], numerous challenges remain before these systems
reach the required level of maturity. These challenges range from technological issues, such as the development of smarter,
more compact machines, to interactive aspects, including the creation of innovative interfaces and modes of communication,
and extend to socio-technical issues related to evaluating trustworthiness and addressing the ethical and legal ramifications
of deploying swarm systems. In this work, we address several limitations of existing multi-UAV and swarm systems for
coverage planning by developing an intelligent distributed model predictive controller. This controller incorporates light-path
propagation constraints, allowing for the generation of optimal, complementary look-ahead trajectories for the efficient coverage
of 3D objects of interest. However, numerous open challenges and limitations persist, and overcoming these obstacles will be
crucial for advancing coverage planning and the field of swarm systems in general, as elaborated next:
a) Scalability and Coordination: A major challenge for UAV swarm systems is their scalability. As the swarm size grows,
managing communication, coordination, and control becomes exponentially more complex. Existing algorithms and frameworks,
including this work, struggle to scale effectively when the number and interactions among the UAVs increases. Currently this
problem is handled by various distributed frameworks which although can handle large number of agents, they only generate
myopic and greedy plans [29]. On the other hand, to enable the generation of complimentary look-ahead coverage plans,
