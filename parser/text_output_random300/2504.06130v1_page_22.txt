Numerical methods
To verify the validity of the analytical expression introduced in eq. (4) of the main doc-
ument, we numerically solved the Semiconductor Bloch Equations (SBEs) [4–6]

are the dipole matrix elements (including the Berry connections

−∞E(t′) dt′ the associated vector potential, bt = k −A(t) is a shifted k
vector, and T2 is the dephasing time. Throughout this work, we use the convention ℏ= 1.
Analogously to our previous work [7], in which we describe the numerical solution of the
SBEs in detail, we used a Haldane model [8] to calculate the band energies and dipole matrix
elements for eq. (8). The electric field is parametrized by

where ˆex is the unit vector in x-direction, E0 is the field strength and T = 200fs is the FWHM
of the Gaussian envelope with respect to the intensity of the light field. The frequency is
varied around the half band gap ∆= 0.826 eV in 96 steps from 0.9∆to 1.1∆. For each
frequency, we simulate the SBEs for 20 different powers from 0.18 mW to 6.0 mW, which
correspond to field strengths of 0.025 V nm−1 to 0.19 V nm−1. After simulating the SBEs,
we calculate the induced current density

where N refers to the number of k-points in the Brillouin zone and pmn(k) = ∇kϵn(k)δmn +
i(ϵm(k)−ϵn(k))dmn(k) are the momentum matrix elements. The sum over the k-points only
contains one point at each valley −K and +K. As the time derivative of the polarization is
equal to the current density j(t) = ∂tP(t), the susceptibility χxxx(ω) can be determined by
Fourier transforming the current density
χxxx(ω) = iωjx(ω)
Ex(ω)2 ,

where Ex(ω) and jx(ω) are the x-components of E(ω) and j(ω), respectively.
