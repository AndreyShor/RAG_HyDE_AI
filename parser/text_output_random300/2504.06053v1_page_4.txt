Linear and quadratic components of the transient
change in the partial spectral weight at excitation fluence 1
mJ/cm2. (a) At T = 295 K, both linear and quadratic com-
ponents exist. (b) At T = 7 K, no linear fluence dependence
is seen.
We investigate the origin of photo-excited carriers by
studying the pump fluence dependence of the carrier den-
sity, which is proportional to the transient change in the
partial spectral weight of the optical conductivity, defined
as
R ω1
ω0 ∆σ1(ω)dω, where ω0 = 3.8 meV and ω1 = 11.4
meV. Within this region of integration, the optical con-
ductivity is predominantly composed of the Drude con-
tribution, and the transient change in spectral weight is
proportional to the excited free-carrier population fol-
lowing the optical sum rule [28].
The change in the
partial spectral weight is fit with linear and quadratic
fluence dependence components, as shown in Fig. 3. Al-
though the free-electron Drude model is over simplified
[29], the optical sum rule is still valid for strongly cor-
related materials [30]. Furthermore, here we study the
itinerant carriers created by above-gap photo-excitation
with low pump fluences. The transient optical conduc-
tivity change can be well captured by the Drude fit (see
Fig. 1 (c)). Similar cases in strongly correlated materi-
als include cuprate superconductors [31, 32], iron-based
superconductors [33], and antiferromagnets with uncon-
ventional excitons [26, 34, 35], in which the Drude model
and/or the optical sum rule has been applied to analyze
photo-excited carriers.
For the T = 295 K case, both the linear component
and quadratic components are necessary to fit the fluence
dependence of the partial spectral weight (Fig. 3(a-c)).
The linear component is more significant in the 1.610
eV pumping case (Fig. 3(c)). At T = 7 K, the tran-
sient change in the partial spectral weight carries a purely
quadratic dependence on fluence for all excitation ener-
gies (Fig. 3(d-f)). The linear and quadratic components
of the transient partial spectral weight change at a fixed
excitation fluence are illustrated in Fig. 4.
We now discuss the implications of the fluence depen-
dence data. The linear fluence dependence of excited free
carriers, seen in the nonequilibrium response at T = 295
K, is characteristic of carriers generated through optical
transitions from below the charge-transfer gap to the con-
ducting states above the charge-transfer gap [28, 36, 37].
The linear component weakens with decreasing photon
energy, and becomes smaller than the measurement er-
rorbars in the 1.476 eV pumping case.
Therefore, the
bandgap at T = 295 K is smaller than and close to 1.494
eV.
For T = 7 K, no linear fluence dependence is seen for
all pump energies, indicating that the bandgap at this
temperature is greater than 1.610 eV. Insulating or semi-
conducting materials commonly exhibit temperature de-
pendent energy gaps. The primary causes of this temper-
ature dependence are thermal expansion of the lattice’s
periodic potential and increased carrier-phonon interac-
tion with increasing temperature [36–40].
A tempera-
ture dependent bandgap is also in agreement with ear-
lier characterization of excitonic features: the spin-orbit-
entangled exciton peaks of NiPS3 shift to higher energies
with decreasing temperature below the N´eel temperature
TN = 155 K [4–6, 22]. The spin-orbit entangled exciton
transition involves an exchange between the S 3p orbitals
and partially filled Ni 3d orbitals which comprise the
charge-transfer gap in NiPS3 [4, 9, 22]. As the bandgap
is larger than 1.610 eV at 7 K, and the exciton feature
peaks at 1.476 eV, we estimate the lower limit of the ex-
citon dissociation energy to be 134 meV, i.e. the energy
difference between the spin-correlated exciton and the
corresponding charge-transfer continuum [26, 41]. The
absorption onset blueshifts about 100 meV from room
temperature to 10 K [22], which agrees well with the en-
ergy difference of the bandgap from our estimation (close
to 1.494 eV at room temperature and greater than 1.610
eV at 7 K). Therefore, we expect that the bandgap at 7
K is close to 1.610 eV, and 134 meV is close to the exact
value of exciton dissociation energy for bulk NiPS3.
Finally, we discuss the origin of the quadratically ex-
cited carriers. In contrast to the large difference in lin-
early excited carriers, all pump energies at T = 295
K exhibit similar quadratically excited spectral weight,
as shown in Fig. 4. Strong absorption and conductiv-
ity at energies between 2.95 eV and 3.22 eV give va-
lidity to TPA as a driving mechanism for carrier gen-
eration [16]. In addition, angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy measurements of NiPS3 show unoccupied
bands with significant density of states available at en-
ergies above 2.3 eV [23]. The similar, large carrier den-
sities between all pump energies at T = 295 K would
indicate that the quadratically excited carriers were all
generated through the same TPA process which accesses
energy levels well above the energy of first conducting
states.
The reduction of the quadratic component for
lower pump energies at T = 7 K is due to the strong
excitonic absorption features at 1.476 eV and 1.494 eV
below the N´eel temperature. Additionally, the narrow-
ing of the 3.5 eV absorption peak with decreasing tem-
perature results in fewer TPA states for the lower transi-
tion energies [16]. A quadratic fluence dependence of the
