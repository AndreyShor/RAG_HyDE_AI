FIG. 8. Log scale index LdT for our chosen active days in 2023,
110 to 119; showing – as done in Fig. 6 – variation by longitude
dodecant for high and mid northern magnetic latitudes (2n, 1n), low
latitudes (0), and mid and high southern magnetic latitudes (1s, 2s).
Here we indicate the range in LdT activity by dividing the dodecant
LdT widths up into three, the two maximum (averaged to give points
⋏), the two minimum (averaged to give points ⋎), and the remaining
eight widths (averaged to give coloured filled circles). The variation
in the three-hourly KP index over its standard range from 0–9 is also
indicated on each as the open star 9. The contemporaneous hourly
variation in Dst index is indicated by black dots, where the value
plotted is −Dst/40, so that it also fits within the vertical axis range of
0–10. Note that although the KP and Dst behaviour might be said to
match reasonably well with our LdT index for high northern latitudes,
it does not do so elsewhere.
tivity indicated by LdT. In addition, and arguably more clearly
than in the April 2023 data, we can see here in May 2024 how
ionospheric disturbances expanded equatorwards into middle
latitudes at North American longitudes. This comparison sup-
ports the need for a scale that is capable of describing the state
of the ionosphere in response to specific space weather con-
ditions, and that can be linked to an impact. The LdT index
describes the state of the ionosphere by utilising information
from dTEC (hence, disturbances in radio propagation) as ob-
served through GNSS links
As a final note, the LdT data presented in this section is
based on the dTEC distribution widths WdT, and so does not
incorporate the power law tail components added to W ∗
dT. As
already discussed, the relative importance of these tails is un-

is significantly poorer agreement between KP, Dst, and LdT.

SUMMARY
Here we have shown that there is a wealth of information
as measured on GNSS radio links that can be extracted from
how the statistics of dTEC values. These typically vary non-
uniformly across the globe, as we can see when constraining
the data slices to those spanning particular set of times, mag-
netic latitudes, and longitudes. However, to ensure robust con-
clusions, the dTEC values needed to undergo a normalisation
process that remove extraneous effects due to (a) line-of-sight
angle and (b) reception band pair.
To extract key characteristics from a available data slices,
we binned and fitted frequency histograms summarizing com-
puted temporal changes in TEC (dTEC) values; where the fit
process enable us to not only avoid problems with potentially
unbounded moments, but also characterising the power-law
tails that make moments problematic. These characteristics,
which we largely reduce to distribution “width” parameters
dTEC units of TECU/s, provide us with a property which re-
lates to the number or strength of ionospheric irregularities in
