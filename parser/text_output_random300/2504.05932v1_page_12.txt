for all α, β, where f is the perturbative part of F. These differential equations can be used to
calculate a0 and f from the already determined A0,0, uniquely. Solving the differential equations
for generic α, β we also obtain a unique perturbative solution.
The solutions obtained are
meaningful for negative α and β and can be used to express the full non-perturbative solutions.
The two quantities Aα,β and aα are related to each other as limβ→∞βAα,β = aα. Since G+(0)
is infinite, we need to use a different normalization for A0,β, A0,0 and a0.
The densities Oα,β defined in (28) can be written as a trans-series in terms of the perturbative
quantities Aα,β. For α = 0, β ̸= 0, we have
O0,β = 1

Here and throughout the paper, as an abuse of notation, whenever we write G−(iκ) for κ > 0 we
mean the limit G−(iκ + 0) that has to be carefully evaluated due to the cut along the positive
imaginary line in G−(ω). For α, β ̸= 0, instead we have

Exponential corrections to the moments
We would like to compute exponential corrections to the moments ϕℓin a similar way to how
the trans-series of the densities are computed in (53), (54) and (55). Specifically, we would like
to take derivatives with respect to β in (54) to obtain the trans-series for the moments. It is
