here, U true, V true, and W true represent the true values of the velocity components,
while U pred, V pred, and W pred are the predicted values. The errors are normalized by the
maximum absolute error to facilitate comparison between different velocity components.
The methodology section has detailed the integration of SVD and HOSVD with LSTM
networks, along with the implementation of the rolling-window method to effectively pro-
cess temporal data. All of the LSTM architectures have been hyper-tuned for optimal
predictive accuracy, the results of which are presented in the next section. This com-
prehensive approach is designed to improve the predictive capabilities and computational
efficiency of the model.

Test Cases
In the investigation of dynamic fluid behavior, the adopted approach has been subjected
to various scenarios of fluid flows to establish its efficacy and adaptability.
The test
cases encompass a diverse range of data types and flow regimes, including laminar and
turbulent flows, as well as numerical and experimental data sets. The proposed method,
which integrates SVD/HOSVD with deep learning architectures, is tested on three fluid
dynamics problems:
• Laminar Flow Past a Circular Cylinder (Numerical):
The flow around a circular cylinder is a well-known benchmark in fluid dynamics
used to validate numerical methods and experimental techniques. The dynamics of
the flow are governed by the Reynolds number (Re), which is defined based on the
cylinder diameter D. At low Reynolds numbers, the flow is steady; however, as Re
increases, significant flow transitions occur.
The motion of an incompressible Newtonian fluid is governed by the Navier-Stokes
equations, expressed as:
∂u
∂t + (u · ∇)u = −1
ρ∇p + ν∇2u

∇· u = 0
