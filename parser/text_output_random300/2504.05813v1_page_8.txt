Once the initial curvature ζ and its derivative are introduced in Eqs.(3.4)-(3.10), the
initial conditions for the numerical evolution of the cosmological fluctuation are set.
The initial conditions from Eqs.(3.4)-(3.9) at first order in ϵ2 are the same as those in
[16] (see also [57, 62]), except for ˜B Eq.(3.8). In that reference, the expansion of B is written
in terms of a transformation between the areal radial coordinate ˜r = reζ(r) (which makes
the spacetime metric of Eq.(3.2) resemble the flat FLRW metric with a non-homogeneous
curvature χ(˜r))2 to the conformally flat coordinate r (see [57] for the transformation between
the coordinates r, ˜r and the curvatures ζ(r), χ(˜r)). However, the metric written in the ˜r
coordinate cannot cover an extremal surface, corresponding to the coordinate singularity
χ(˜r)˜r2 = 1 [32, 64], and therefore a coordinate singularity associated with the throat structure
R′(rII) = 0 for type-II fluctuations will be present. For this reason, we make the expansion
directly from the background quantity B(ϵ →0) = aeζ in the r coordinate to avoid this issue
and obtain a new initial condition free from divergent terms related to type-II fluctuations.
Although we provide the term ˜K at first order in ϵ2, we have found that setting up
the initial condition from the exact definition in Eq.(2.15) makes the numerical evolution
much more stable for the cases tested, with the Hamiltonian constraint decreasing from the
beginning of the simulation rather than growing. The definition given in Eq.(2.15) contains
the divergent term associated with the type-II fluctuations; however, using an alternative
definition for the time-derivative of the function B, obtained from the other Misner-Sharp
equations (see for instance [36] in the context of PBH formation from vacuum bubbles), we
have derived a new equation,
