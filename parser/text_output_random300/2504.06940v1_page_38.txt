Appendix B: Continuation of Theorem III.2
In Theorem III.2 we analyzed the spectrum of the Grover gate. However, in Sec. III A we only proved the part of
the theorem that is useful to our later analysis. Here we will complete the proof for the theorem.
Theorem B.1 (Spectrum of Grover Gate, Restated). The spectrum of the Grover gate G for a real univariate variable
θ contains all eigenvalues of the form eiα where −π < α ⩽π satisfies Eq. (39) (assuming tan θk−α

do not blow up
for any k ∈Ω). Corresponding to α, the eigenvector, specified by |ψ⟩where ψ is a complex random variable, satisfy
Eq. (40).
In the event that there are multiple outcomes in θ that share the same value (mod 2π). For each possible such value
φ ∈(−π, π], let S = {k ∈Ω: θk = φ (mod 2π)}. We find, in addition, an eigenvalue eiα satisfying φ −α = π
(mod 2π), and eigenvectors |ψ⟩(where ψ is a complex random variable) with
ψk = 0
∀k ̸∈S
E [ψ] = 0
(B1)
Proof. In the main text, we have simplified the equation for eigenvalues down to Eq. (45), which we will restate here:
E [ψ] = 1 + ei(θ−α)

ψ
(B2)
To complete our cases, now consider α such that there are some k ∈Ωsuch that ei(θk−α) = −1. Then we immediately
finds E [ψ] = 0. Let A = {k ∈Ω: θk −α = π (mod 2π)}. This means that ψk = 0 for all k ̸∈A. Combined, that is:
ψk = 0
∀k ̸∈A
E [ψ] = 0
(B3)
We can show that under the assumptions we made on α, this equation is equivalent to Eq. (B2). Note that such
equation has non-trivial solution if and only if |A| ⩾2. This means that we find multiple θk takes the same value
(α + π), mod 2π, for all k ∈A. Conversely, for each value φ such that there are multiple k ∈Ωwith θk = φ, setting
α = θ −π (mod 2π) immediately traces back to satisfy Eq. (B2) and shows corresponding eigenvalues and eigenkets.
Combined with the main text, we complete the proof for Theorem III.2.
