resummation scale variations between partonic channels at this order. This cancellation
also occurred at NNLL′ although to a rather lesser degree. To alleviate the cancellation
of uncertainty between partonic channels, we developed an alternative ‘MaxDev’ approach
for the uncertainties where we only vary the beam scale µB in the partonic channel that
yields the largest uncertainty band. We compared the results of this against a simplified
version of the Theory Nuisance Parameter approach [40] and found agreement between the
two for the NNLL′ + NNLO case, suggesting that the uncertainty estimate is reasonable
here. In the NLL′ + NLO case the MaxDev uncertainty is somewhat smaller than the
TNP one, which is due to the fact that the former still suffers from the anomalously small
response to µS, and thus is still likely an underestimate.
We produced predictions with R = 0.5 and for Q integrated between 80 and 100 GeV
(although results for other values of R and/or Q can be obtained on request from the
authors). The resummation of time-like logarithms (‘π2 resummation’) was included but
was found to have a minimal effect on the NNLL′ + NNLO predictions. Using the MaxDev
prescription for the uncertainties, we found that for the TBj observable and T cut = 10
GeV, the uncertainty reduces from 5.6% at NLL′ + NLO to 3.1% at NNLL′ + NNLO,
with the central value increasing from 1372 pb to 1439 pb. For the TCj case, the corre-
sponding uncertainties are 5.8% and 3.4%, with the central values being 1486 pb and 1538
pb respectively.
Our predictions for Drell-Yan production with a TB/Cj veto are of a comparable pre-
cision to the corresponding state-of-the-art predictions with a pTj veto, and it will be
interesting to compare these with the experimental data from the LHC in the future.
