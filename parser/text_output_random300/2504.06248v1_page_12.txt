which the special linear group naturally forms a subalgebra.
All the forms of the Koopman generator can be useful depending on the context. We will typically use Eq. (S10)
as in the paper, because of its simple form. In the next section, we show how one can find monomial eigenfunctions
for the generator K and how they lead to constants of motion.

MONOMIAL EIGENFUNCTIONS AND THEIR CONSERVATION
Among the most fundamental objects in Koopman theory are the eigenfunctions. The goal of this section is to
provide the proof of Theorem 1 on monomial eigenfunctions from the main text and the details regarding their
conservation, along with some basic examples.
A.
Proof of Theorem 1: Monomial eigenfunctions of the Koopman generator
Before providing the proof of the first theorem of the paper, we need to introduce an important lemma that defines
symmetrizable matrices in a more general way than Ref. [81].
Lemma S4. Consider a real matrix B of size b × b. The following statements are equivalent:
1. B is symmetrizable;
2. DB is symmetric, where D is a real diagonal matrix with nonzero diagonal elements;
3. µjBjk = µkBkj for some µj, µk ∈R \ {0} for all 1 ≤j < k ≤b;
4.
(a) Bjk ̸= 0 whenever Bkj ̸= 0 for all 1 ≤j < k ≤b;
(b) Bi1i2Bi2i3...Biη−1iηBiηi1 = Bi1iηBiηiη−1...Bi3i2Bi2i1 for all sequences i1, i2, ..., iη of elements of {1, ..., b}.
Proof. (1 ⇔2) By definition.
(2 ⇔3) Since all the elements of µ = (µj)b
j=1 and those of the diagonal of D are nonzero, suppose that D = diag(µ).
Element-wise, DB = (DB)⊤is then equivalent to µjBjk = µkBkj for all 1 ≤j < k ≤b.
(3 ⇒4) First, all the elements of µ are nonzero and thus, µjBjk = µkBkj implies that Bjk = µkBkj/µj for all
j, k ∈{1, ..., b}. Consequently, Bkj ̸= 0 implies that Bjk ̸= 0. Second, multiplying together µkBkj = µjBjk for any
sequence i1, i2, ..., iη of elements of {1, ..., b} gives
µi1µi2...µiη−1µiηBi1i2Bi2i3...Biη−1iηBiηi1 = µi1µiη...µi3µi2Bi1iηBiηiη−1...Bi3i2Bi2i1 .
(S15)
But µj ̸= 0 for all j and therefore,
Bi1i2Bi2i3...Biη−1iηBiηi1 = Bi1iηBiηiη−1...Bi3i2Bi2i1 .
(S16)
(3 ⇐4) The matrix B can be interpreted as the weight matrix of a strongly connected (because of condition 4(a)),
weighted, and directed graph. If the graph is not connected, simply repeat the following process for each strongly
