Integration constants
Once we compute the zeroth moment ϕ0 from Volin’s recursive algorithm described in Section 2,
we would like to obtain higher moments ϕℓusing the differential equation (35). As was already
mentioned, a solution ϕℓto this differential equation has two free parameters and in this section
we will discuss how to fix them.
We recall that the differential equation (35) is written in terms of derivatives with respect
to B, and we would like to rewrite this expression in terms of v derivatives. From the definition
of the v coupling in (24), we easily find
dv
db = −2v2
1 −v.

The chain rule then leads to the following equivalent differential equation:

where prime denotes derivative with respect to v.
We assume the following perturbative ansatz for the moments3

We cannot prove that ϕ(0)
ℓ
has a regular power series expansion in v without log v terms, but
this is compatible with all the terms we calculated from Volin’s method and justified a posteriori
by comparing to the numerical solution of the problem.
The leading behaviour in v can be deduced e.g. from expanding the leading order term

of the bulk ansatz for large x, see also the footnote at (10). When plugging
this expression in (43), we obtain the following constraint between the perturbative coefficients:

Note that this result is only valid under the condition k ̸= 2ℓand k ̸= 2ℓ+ 2, which corresponds
to the coefficients of 1/v2 and v0 in the perturbative expansion of ϕ(0)
ℓ. These two coefficients
are precisely the two integration constants for solutions to the differential equation (43). One
way to partially address this issue, as discussed in [7], is to consider (45) with ℓ7→ℓ+ 1 and
3We denote the perturbative coefficients of ϕ(0)
ℓ
in the coupling v as φ(0)
ℓ,k to avoid confusion with the notation
introduced in (6) for the coefficients of the same quantity in the coupling g.
