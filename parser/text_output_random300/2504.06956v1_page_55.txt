satisfies the conditions required in the statement of Corollary 6.5. Therefore, for ε > 0 as fixed above
and for s ≥0 sufficiently large, it holds almost surely that

Thanks to [DRSV14a, Theorem 4], the sequence of random measure (µγc,s)s≥0 converges as s →∞
almost surely to µγc in the topology of vague convergence. Furthermore, we can extract positive
diverging sequences (sn)n∈N and (Rn)n∈N such that 1Esn,Rn converges almost surely to 1 as n →∞.
This follows since, thanks to [Mad15, Lemmas 3.1, 3.2, 3.3] (see also [MRV16, Lemma A.2]), we have
that P(Es,R) converges to 1 as s, R →∞. In particular, this shows that the following convergences
hold almost surely

Therefore, the conclusion follows by arbitrariness of ε > 0.

where here, to simplify the notation, we have omitted the dependence of Tγ on (fi)i∈[n], and where
we recall that ea⋆= β(d, γ)a⋆with a⋆as defined in (2.11).
We consider the sequence (sn)n∈N introduced in the statement of Lemma 6.7. For n ∈N, we
consider u, t ≥0 such that u < sn < t, and we note that
