Figure 2: Problem setup. (a) Plan view of a semicircular canal showing the
spatially-varying canal radius, 𝑎(𝑠), and the cupula (shaded in grey), which is situated in
the enlarged portion, or utricle. (b) Schematic of the chosen coordinate system. (c) Close
up of the region around the cupula, highlighting the cupula’s thickness, 𝑡ℎ, and its
attachment to the canal walls via the ‘crista’ (black region). (The toroidal flow is shown
schematically here to allow the zoom in on the cupula.)
endolymph is assumed to be an incompressible Newtonian fluid of dynamic viscosity 𝜇and
density 𝜌. The elastic, gel-like cupula occupies a thin region (shown in grey in fig. 2) and has
density 𝜌𝑠, Young’s modulus 𝐸, thickness 𝑡ℎand Poisson ratio 𝜈𝑠. The cupula is assumed to
occupy the entire cross-section of the canal, as can be seen in Figure 2(c), where the solid
cupula is shaded in yellow and the liquid endolymph is shaded in blue. (The region shaded
in black represents a structure called the crista which attaches the cupula to the canal wall.
However, the azimuthal size of the crista will not appear directly in this work.)
2.1. Equations for the bulk
The Navier–Stokes equations for the dimensional fluid velocity ˆu and pressure ˆ𝑝in the
co-rotating frame are given by (Landau & Lifshitz 1987)
∇· ˆu = 0,
(2.1a)
𝐷ˆu
𝐷ˆ𝑡+ 𝜕ˆ𝛀
𝜕ˆ𝑡× ˆx + 2 ˆ𝛀× ˆu + ˆ𝛀× ( ˆ𝛀× ˆx) = −∇ˆ𝑝+ 𝜇∇2 ˆu.
(2.1b)
Here, the first of the extra terms on the left hand side is the Euler force, the second term is the
Coriolis force and the final additional term is the centrifugal force, each due to the imposed
rotation. The fluid is assumed to satisfy the no-slip condition at the edges of the walls, so that
ˆu(ˆ𝑟= ˆ𝑎(ˆ𝑠)) = 0 for 𝑠∈(0, 2𝜋𝑅). Motivated by the small strains in the cupula (Selva et al.
2009), it is modeled as a linearly elastic material, satisfying the steady Navier equations:
∇· ˆ𝝉= 0,
(2.2)
alongside a linear Hookean constitutive law relating stress ˆ𝝉and the strains. Finally, we
model the fluid structure interaction at the cupula-endolymph boundary in the usual way,
imposing continuity of velocity and stress (Gkanis & Kumar 2006).
2.2. Numerical simulations
The system of equations (2.1)-(2.2) was simulated in COMSOL for different values of the
Young’s modulus of the cupula and with a Poisson ratio 𝜈𝑠= 0.3. We impose a simple
sinusoidal forcing, given by ˆΩ(ˆ𝑡) = Ω0 sin(2𝜋𝑡/𝑡typ), with Ω0 = 1rad/s and 𝑡typ = 1 s. The
geometrical parameters are 𝑎= 1.6 × 10−4 m, 𝑅= 3.2 × 10−3 m and 𝑡ℎ= 0.8 × 10−4 m
(Daocai et al. 2014).
