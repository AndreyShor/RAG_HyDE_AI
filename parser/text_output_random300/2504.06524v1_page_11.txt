A general solution takes the form:
φs,±(kx, y) = (aeiqy + be−iqy)e±σs˜κy,

˜κ = m ˜∆

Applying the boundary condition φs,±(kx, 0) = 0, we obtain:
φs,±(kx, y) = c sin(qy)e±σs˜κy.
(36)
Moreover, the boundary condition, φs,±(kx, W) ∝sin(qW) = 0, leads to
q = qn = nπ
W ,
n = ±1, ±2, · · · .

From q =

Since kn must be real, the integer number n is restricted to
n = ±1, ±2, · · · , ±nc
(39)
where nc = [WkF /π]G represents the number of propagating channels per spin. From the normalization condition:

s,±(kx, y)φs,±(kx, y) = 1,
(40)
we obtain:

Since φs,+(kn, y) and φs,−(kn, y) are degenerate, we can construct alternative expressions for the zero-energy states
by taking linear combinations of these functions. Here, we construct the wave function of the zero-energy states,
˜ψ±

where ±ǫs(kx) denotes the energy eigenvalues of the Andreev bound states (ABSs). Equation (43) means that ǫs(kx)
forms a continuous spectrum with respect to kx, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a) of the main text. This is achieved by the
