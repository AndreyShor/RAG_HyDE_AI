Figure 6. The temporal properties of Type IL GRB samples. a, The T90 vs Tpre diagram. b, The Tpre vs Twt
diagram. c, The T90 vs Twt diagram. In aâ€“c, Type I and Type II GRBs are represented by cyan solid circles and gray solid
diamonds, respectively. In c, two typical Type II GRBs with extended emission, GRB 221009A and GRB 160625B are put in
red diamonds. The GRB sample is obtained from the literature (Wang et al. 2020; Hu et al. 2014).
