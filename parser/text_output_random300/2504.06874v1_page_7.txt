Vg = 60 V (positive maximum of this closed gating loop) and from 0 V to Vg = -45 V  
 
Fig. 2. Identifying two polar stackings with gate-dependent SNOM imaging. a-h, SNOM images 
at representative backgate voltages (Vg) for 0 V – 60 V (a-d with electron doping) and 0 V – -45 V 
(e-h with hole doping). Domains with distinct stacking orders are denoted by different symbols in 
(b). A DW separating two adjacent polar stackings ABAC and ABCB are denoted as regions I and II 
in (c); regions III and II have identical polar stackings. The polarization directions are experimentally 
determined by an independent KPFM measurement at 0 V (Fig. S9). All the measured near-field 
signals in (a-h) are presented by the same color bar. The scale bar in (a) is 1 µm (same scale in (a-
h)). i, Extracted optical contrast between two polar stackings as a function of the Vg for the bottom 
axis and of the carrier density (n) for the top axis. Optical contrast between regions I and II for the 
first cycle measurement (𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼−𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼)/𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼  and that between regions I and III for the second cycle 
measurement (𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼−𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼)/𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 are displayed by the red dots and black dots, respectively. The error 
bars in (i) are obtained by evaluating the standard deviations in each region (see Methods). j, A 
schematic of the proposed model to explain the observed optical contrast change in (i). The carriers 
of topmost graphene layer are respectively electrons and holes for ABAC (polarization downward) 
and ABCB (polarization upward) stackings at global charge neutrality point (CNP) according to the 
calculated charge density distribution shown in Figs. 1c and 1e. The filling of the topmost graphene 
layer under gating is abided by the calculated layer-projected DOS in (k) and (l). k,l, Calculated 
layer-projected DOS for ABAC and ABCB stackings at charge neutrality, respectively.
