of users, and security issues in QSS protocols, such as in [399], remain underanalyzed, particularly for
participant attacks [401]. To address these challenges, Li et al. [402] proposed an MDI-QSS protocol
based on spatial multiplexing, achieving a transmission distance over 300 km and a secret key rate two
orders of magnitude higher than [401], while addressing security concerns like participant attacks. Ju et
al. [403] introduced a hyper-encoding MDI-QSS protocol using polarization and spatial-mode degrees of
freedom for enhanced error resilience and achieved a key rate improvement of three orders of magnitude
over the original MDI-QSS protocol under a 100 km transmission distance. Zhang et al. [404] developed
a secure protocol against Trojan horse attacks.
Chen et al. [405] demonstrated finite-key performance using a biased decoy-state approach, further
extended by an asymmetric decoy-state method achieving secure communication over 43.6 km [406].
Protocols using W-states [407] and cluster states [408] showed feasibility for distances over 150 km and
280 km, respectively. MDI key agreement protocols are discussed in[409–411].
Continuous variable protocols. A continuous-variable Measurement-Device-Independent (MDI) multi-
party quantum communication protocol was initially explored by Wu et al.
[412], utilizing squeezed
states of light and homodyne measurements to optimize the secret key rate. To execute QCC and QSS
communication protocols, they employ a Continuous-Variable GHZ state, a multipartite entangled state
with squeezed uncertainties in relative position and total momentum [413]. In the case of the tripartite
CV GHZ state, their positions and momenta satisfy the relations ˆX1 −ˆX2 →0, ˆX2 −ˆX3 →0, and
ˆP1 + ˆP2 + ˆP3 →0.
The security analysis in [412] addresses two types of attacks: entangling cloner and coherent attacks.
Under the entangling cloner attack, the maximal transmission distances can be extended in scenarios of
unbalanced distribution. In contrast, the coherent attack notably diminishes the maximum transmission
distances.
A coherent state-based MDI multiparty protocol was investigated in [414], demonstrating
superior performance compared to the squeezed state-based MDI protocol in terms of experimental real-
izations.
The three-party CV GHZ state in [412] is not prepared and then distributed; instead, it is obtained
through postprocessing using the concept of entanglement swapping. Conversely, Guo et al. [415] em-
ploy a four-party GHZ state to execute the CV-MDI QSS protocol. Specifically, the four participants
prepare and transmit modulated states to a relay for the generation of a four-party GHZ state. In this
protocol, three participants collaborate to acquire the fourth person’s secret key by leveraging the GHZ
state. Furthermore, given that the detection apparatus inherently possesses imperfections, which do not
compromise security but can diminish the generation rate of the final secret key, optical amplifiers are
deployed to enhance the signal and compensate for these inherent imperfections. This deployment results
in an increased transmission distance. The same conclusion was found for the CV-MDI QCC [416]. The
continuous variable measurement-device-independent quantum secret sharing and quantum conference
based on a four-mode cluster state with different structures were conducted by Wang et al. [417].
Ottaviani et al. introduced an MDI-modular network in their work [418], presenting a modular design for
continuous-variable networks. In this architecture, each module functions as a MDI star network. Within
each module, users transmit modulated coherent states to an untrusted relay, thereby establishing multi-
partite secret correlations through a generalized Bell detection mechanism. Their investigation revealed
that under ideal conditions, up to 50 users can achieve private communication exceeding 0.1 bit per use
within a radius of 40 m, comparable to the size of a large building. Fletcher et al. [419] utilized the
same generalized Bell detection technique to establish multipartite correlations between user variables.
Their study demonstrates that postselection procedures based on performing reconciliation on the signs
of prepared quadratures of coherent states can be effectively used to broaden the protocol’s operational
range.
5.3.6. Experiments in Measurement Device Independent QKD
MDI-QKD was an important advance in that it reduces vulnerability to detector attacks, while being
feasible with current technology. Not long after the concept was introduced, several proof-of-principle
realizations were achieved. Ref. [420] reported a demonstration of MDI-QKD over more than 80 km
of spooled fiber as well as in inter-city fiber links. A demonstration using polarization qubits over two
optical fiber links of 8.5 km each employed a full-polarization control system to stabilize and control the
polarization drift in the fibers [421]. Moreover, the feasibility of MDI-QKD with polarization encoding
was demonstrated in 10km of telecom fiber using standard off-of-shelf devices [422]. Other sophisticated
implementations using decoy-state MDI-QKD have been realized over tens and even hundreds of km of
optical fibers [98, 99, 103]. MDI-QKD Progress has advanced quite rapidly, a summary MDI-QKD in
terms of bit rate/distance is shown in Fig. 4a.
