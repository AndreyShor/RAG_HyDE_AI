Here, the net energy flux is computed as ⟨RT ⟩−⟨FS⟩because both terms have downward as positive. The downward
on the top of the atmosphere means the energy goes “into” the atmosphere, but the downward on the surface mean the
energy “leaves” the atmosphere. This is different from equation 15 where both sources and sinks are at the surface.
The air temperature (T) can be corrected to ensure thermal energy (CpT) closes the energy budget, forcing ϵA = 0:
⟨A∗(t1)⟩= ⟨A (t0)⟩+ ∆t⟨RT ⟩−⟨FS⟩,
γ = ⟨A∗(t1)⟩
⟨A (t1)⟩
T ∗(t1) = γT (t1) + γ −1
Cp
[Lvq (t1) + Φs + k (t1)]

Where ⟨A∗(t1)⟩is the corrected global sum of total atmospheric energy, γ is the multiplicative correction ratio. The
same γ is applied to T at all grid cells and pressure levels.

Global Spectra
The verification of the global energy spectrum is computed using spherical harmonic transforms. For a given forecasted
or analyzed field F (ϕ, λ), it can be represented using spherical harmonic functions Y (ϕ, λ) as orthonormal basis and
spherical harmonic coefficients (a):
F (ϕ, λ) =
lmax
X
l=0
l
X
m=−l
am
l Y m
l
(ϕ, λ)
(22)
Where degree l represents the total angular frequency of Y . m is the zonal wave number. The energy spectrum of F at
a given m is the sum of magnitudes of a in all degrees with l ≥m:
P (m) =
X
l≥m
∥am
l ∥2
(23)
The kinetic energy (m2 · s−2) and potential temperature energy (K2) spectrum on 500 hPa pressure level were computed
and as functions of m, ti, and tl. The result is averaged on ti. Comparing P (m) on forecasts and the ERA5 target,
the ability of weather prediction models to represent the energy transfer across scales can be verified. In addition, the
energy spectrum provides a measure of the effective resolution of AI NWP models, which helps identify the smoothing
effect of neural-network-based computations and model training.
