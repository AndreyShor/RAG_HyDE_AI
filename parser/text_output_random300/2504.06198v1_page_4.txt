Early Warning Signs for SPDEs with Red Noise
To summarize, the function ud solves a linear equation under the influence of red noise that is added at every point x within
the space domain X1. The linear spectrum is assumed to be discrete so that we can find a set of basis functions (modes)
n
e(p)
i,k
∗o
of H1 that separates neatly into generalized eigenspaces associated with the discrete eigenvalues. The eigenspace
E1(p)∗is of particular interest since it is associated with the critical eigenvalue λ(p)
1 , which will cross the imaginary axis,
e.g., during a bifurcation. These modes will experience the most direct system destabilization.
(b) As a second case, we consider uc = uc(x, t) to solve
duc(x, t) = (f(x, p)uc(x, t) + σRξ1(x, t)) dt,
uc(0, x) = u0(x) ∈H1,
(2.4)
for x ∈X1 and t > 0. The function f : X1 × R<0 →R<0 is assumed to be analytic. For a fixed x∗, the function satisfies
f(x, p) < 0
and
f(x∗, 0) = 0,
for any (x, p) ∈X1 × R≤0 \ {(x∗, 0)}. Similarly to the previous case, we consider for simplicity values of p < 0 < κ such that
f(x, p) + κ ̸= 0
for any x ∈X1. In contrast, the operator f can have a continuous spectrum. The implications of this on the presence of
EWS is studied in Section 3.
(c) Lastly, we observe the solution ub = ub(x, t) of
(
dub(x, t) = A(p)ub(x, t)dt,
ub(0, x) = u0(x) ∈H1,
(2.5)
for x ∈X1 and
γ(p)ub(x, t) = σRξ0(x, t),
on the boundary x ∈X0 and t > 0. The deterministic part of (2.5) has the same properties as that of the first considered
case. In this case, we are investigating the effect of setting noise on the boundary of the space domain. The linear operator
γ(p) : D (γ(p)) ⊆H1 →H0
defines the boundary conditions. Furthermore, we assume that, for fixed p ≤0, there exists a continuous q = q(p) ∈R such
that for any boundary value problem
(A(p) −q)w = 0
,
γ(p) w = v ,
with v ∈H0, there exists a unique solution w = D(p)v ∈D(A(p)) ⊆H1. For any p ≤0, we indicate D(p)∗as the adjoint
operator of D(p) with respect to the scalar products on the Hilbert spaces H1 and H0. We assume the operator D(p)∗to
be uniformly bounded in L2(H1; H0) for any p ≤0. Setting
A0(p)v = A(p)v
for any v ∈H1 such that γ(p)v = 0, we assume A0 to satisfy the properties described above in (a). Moreover, we consider
values of q that are not in the spectrum of A0(p) and A0(p)∗for p close to 0. We obtain then that
Λ(p) := (A0(p) −q) D(p)Q0D(p)∗(A0(p)∗−q)
(2.6)
depends on operator γ. The mild solution of the last system is defined [19] in the form
ub(x, t) = eA0(p)tu0(x) + σσR

Following [9, 24, 34], we aim to construct early-warning signs to the approaches p →0−and κ →0+, respectively. On such
thresholds, the dissipativity in the linear system that defines u and ξ is lost, and the origin in H1 ×H1 is not a stable deterministic
equilibrium. However, the two limit cases have very different physical interpretations. While the p →0−limit is a stand-in
for dynamical bifurcations of non-linear systems, κ →0+ represents a change in the characteristics of the driving noise.
In
the context of, e.g., climate tipping points, only the former limit would be of interest.
We hope to find EWS in the system
variance with respect to different probing functions. If such a probing function is composed of a destabilising mode, we would
conventionally expect variance to increase. We define the covariance as Cov. In case (a) and (b), we set the linear variance operator
