(viii) Given that we want to keep the case when p ∈♢for the uniform part and p ∈G\♢for the exponential
part, we must flip the output of the ♢ancilla controlled on the branch ancilla. This requires only a
single CNOT, with no non-Clifford cost.
(ix) The subspace that we wish to amplify is now encoded in the |0⟩subspace of the ♢ancilla. Naively, the
amount of amplification depends on the input parameters to the problem. However, we note that both
the subspace and its amplitude are known in advance, and so we can incorporate the same “partial
reflection” trick as in USP to amplify this branch to unit relative amplitude with a single round. This
requires three calls to the preparation above, plus some small overhead to carry out the reflections.
We omit this overhead in the resource estimate.
(x) We assume that the cost to uncompute µ is the same as the cost of computation; i.e. n2 + 5n.
(xi) The ♢ancilla is already in the |0⟩state and can be discarded. Uncomputation of the branch ancilla
can be carried out by rechecking whether p ∈♢. If we have retained the outputs of the inequality tests
in step (v), this requires only two Toffolis. The inequality tests themselves are uncomputed with cost
3n + 2.
(xii) Finally, the calculation of kp is uncomputed with cost 3˜n + 6n.
The total cost is therefore 12˜n + 74n + 4n2 + 6bpln + 6bexpn + 3brot + 8. For R rounds of amplification,
this must be repeated 1 + R times (and the dagger R times). We assume that both have the same cost,
and therefore that the complexity above must be multiplied by 1 + 2R. As for ancillas, the rotations require
bexp qubits and the kp and µ registers are over n qubits, and the intermediate arithmetic requires n qubits.
Other constant-factor costs (such as additional ancillae for amplitude amplification and checking inequality
tests) are omitted.
