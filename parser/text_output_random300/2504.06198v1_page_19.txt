Early Warning Signs for SPDEs with Red Noise
non-stationary noise.
We have performed numerical experiments for the same class of SPDEs. We introduced red noise either as a dynamic term or
as a boundary condition. The expected divergences of variance corresponding to CSD could be reproduced in these experiments.
The performed statistical assessment resembles the setting of an applied time series analysis in a real-world system suspected of
bifurcating. Furthermore, we have reproduced the effect of an increase in variance as a response to an increase in the correlation
time of the noise. The case of muted EWS, on the other hand, could occur when a system genuinely loses linear stability, but
noise correlation speeds up simultaneously. The two opposing effects on the system variance can cancel, leading to a muted CSD
signal.
In general, the analysis of CSD in time series data is only possible in case the dynamics of the system in question are well-understood
[21, 35, 10, 13, 4, 43]. For specific models of real-world systems, it may be possible to derive EWS, such as time series variance
or other statistical quantities [5, 42, 45]. Without confirming that the phenomenon of CSD manifests in the specific modelling
setting, its application can potentially fail. In this work, we have added a modelling setting to the list of confirmed occurrences of
CSD. This is the bifurcating SPDE setting with red noise. This class of models carries relevance in the analysis of systems from,
e.g., the field of climate or ecology [26, 54, 50]. The employment of methodology based on CSD is thus mathematically motivated
for yet a larger range of real-world systems.
