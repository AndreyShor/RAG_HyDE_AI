and the g-functions for other bound-
aries follows from fusion and the quantum dimensions of the
topological defects.
It is well-known that the bulk flows with respect to the three
operators O = ϵ, σ, σ′ are massive [86]. We summarize the
symmetries C preserved by such flows and the corresponding
IR gapped phases in Table I. The corresponding conformal
pinning defects are then fixed in terms of conformal bound-
aries (IV.5) by the factorization channels in (III.2), together
with the g-theorem [87].
The results are listed in Table I
where we also include the bimodule categories M labeling
the conformal defects in the IR. There Vec denotes symmetry-
absorbing cases (III.6) and all other cases coincide with the
canonical (trivial) bimodule category C. The boundary states
that participate in the factorization channels also agree with
the RG interfaces identified in [68–70].

denote a symmetry breaking phase with k degenerate ground states.
It is straightforward to extend this analysis to other minimal
models. In Appendix A, we give more examples. There we
also explain that certain generalizations of the pinning flows
considered here, with a nontrivial topological defect in the UV
deformed by twisted operators, can be solved in a similar way.

Pinning Flows in 3d O(N) CFT
In the 3d O(N) CFT, there are two simple kinds of surface
pinning flows, by considering either the fundamental scalar
operator ϕI or the mass operators (either an O(N) scalar or
tensor), which all have dimension ∆< 2 (see Table II for a
summary).

From our general result in Section II, the corresponding IR
pinning defect will factorize into conformal boundary condi-
tions of the O(N) CFT. In particular, the O(N) symmetric
boundary conditions are classified into the ordinary, the spe-
cial and the extraordinary-log classes [31, 89]. The first two
cases are more familiar and can be thought of as interacting
versions of the Dirichlet and Neumann conformal boundary
conditions for free theory. The last case is more exotic, not
strictly speaking conformal, due to logarithmic behaviors in
correlation functions, and turns out to be closely related to the
normal boundary condition |⃗n⟩labeled by ⃗n ∈Sn−1 which
has nonzero one-point function with the fundamental scalar
⃗n·ϕ and breaks the O(N) symmetry [31]. This extraordinary-
log boundary class exists via a marginally irrelevant coupling
between |⃗n⟩and N−1 2d Goldstones ⃗π for 2 ≤N < Ncr ≈5
[31, 90, 91] and have a generalization for interface with no up-
per critical N [26].
Let us first consider the case of O(N) symmetric pinning
flows, namely O = (ϕ2)S. Based on large N analysis, it was
proposed in [26] that for h < 0, the pinning defect factorizes
into the ordinary boundary conditions,
D+((ϕ2)S) = |Ord⟩⟨Ord| .
(IV.6)
This is also supported by resumming perturbative results for
scaling dimensions on the surface defect in d=4−ϵ dimen-
sions [30] and comparing to numerical results for |Ord⟩
[92, 93]. This factorization is in agreement with our general
result since the positive mass (h < 0) deformation gaps the
theory to a single ground state (thus one factorization chan-
nel) when turned on in the bulk. The case with h > 0 is more
interesting, as the negative bulk mass deformation leads to a
gapless phase with N−1 Goldstone modes, and correspond-
ingly, the proposal of [26] suggests that the defect is described
by factorized normal boundary conditions |⃗n⟩⟨⃗n| weakly cou-
pled to N−1 Goldstone modes. Effectively, defined as an op-
erator on the CFT Hilbert space, in the IR limit, we have
D−((ϕ2)S) ∝

Sn−1 d⃗n|⃗n⟩⟨⃗n| ,
(IV.7)
which again agrees with our general results.
For O(N) breaking pinning flows, such as that by the fun-
damental scalar, the natural expectation is a factorization into
normal boundary conditions,
D±(⃗n · ϕ) = |±⃗n⟩⟨±⃗n| .

preserving the residual O(N−1) symmetry.
