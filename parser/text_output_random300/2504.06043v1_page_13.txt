decay strongly into J/ψp. Since the J/ψ cannot be produced in the process of the decay, the states contain at least five quarks, c¯cuud. The
data were analyses further in Refs. [147, 148] which supported the existence of two states. A later analysis based on an order of magnitude
larger data sample, shows that the Pc¯c(4450) structure consists of two narrow overlapping peaks, Pc¯c(4440) and Pc¯c(4457), and a third narrow
peak Pc¯c(4312) appears [149]. However, there is no longer clear evidence for the broad Pc¯c(4380). As in the meson sector, these discoveries
were followed by numerous theoretical interpretations of the nature of the pentaquarks, including hadronic molecules [121, 150–179],
compact pentaquark states [175, 180–185], hadro-charmonia [186–188], and cusp effects [175].
The proximity of the Σc ¯D(∗) thresholds to these narrow pentaquark structures suggests that the corresponding two-hadron states play
an important role in the dynamics of the pentaquarks, suggesting an interpretation of their structure as hadronic molecules. In the most
common hadronic molecular picture, the Pc¯c(4312) is an S -wave Σc ¯D bound state, while the Pc¯c(4440) and Pc¯c(4457) are bound states of
Σc ¯D∗with different spin structures [153, 158, 164, 172, 178]. The origin of the peak from the Pc¯c(4312) is attributed to a virtual state of
Σc ¯D in Ref. [189] based on amplitude analysis, which only fits data around the Σc ¯D threshold. In Ref. [175], the final state interactions are
constructed based on a K matrix containing the J/ψp-Σc ¯D-Σc ¯D∗channels. The analysis suggests that Pc¯c(4312) is a Σc ¯D molecule, while
the Pc¯c(4440) could be a compact pentaquark state, and the Pc¯c(4457) could be caused by the cusp effect.7
While the proximity of the narrow Pc¯c peaks to the Σc ¯D(∗) thresholds makes the molecular interpretation for the states natural, at least
some peaks in the J/ψp mass distributions can also be generated by triangle singularities [149, 191, 193–196]. A triangle singularity arises
when all intermediate particles in a triangle loop are (almost) on the mass shell and the particles move collinearly. Therefore, its location
is quite sensitive to the masses and widths of the particles involved [191]. The potential triangle singularities have been discussed in
Ref. [149] for the three Pc¯c structures. Considering the realistic widths of the exchanged resonances, the Pc¯c(4312) and Pc¯c(4440) structures
are unlikely to be caused by triangle singularities. However, the Pc¯c(4457) structure could in principle be generated by a triangle diagram
with D∗
s1(2860), Λc(2595) and ¯D∗0 in the intermediate state.
Under the assumption that the observed pentaquarks are molecular in nature, heavy quark spin symmetry allows one to predict spin
partner states. Combining the light quark spins of the Σc, jP
light = 1+, and the ground state D mesons, jP
light = (1/2)+, allows for two distinct
total angular momenta of the light quarks, namely 1/2 and 3/2. Accordingly the dynamics in the Σ(∗)
c
¯D(∗) channels is controlled by two
contact terms [153]. It turns out that heavy-quark spin symmetry (HQSS)8 predicts seven Pc¯c states, divided into two heavy quark spin
multiplets. Three of these seven correspond to those reported by LHCb [153, 172, 197, 198]: While the Pc¯c(4312) is unambiguously
assigned to the JP = 1

−Σc ¯D bound state, there are two possible spin structures for the Pc¯c(4440) and Pc¯c(4457) identified as the Σc ¯D∗
bound states, namely JP = 1

−[153, 155, 172], and their spin assignment is not uniquely determined by HQSS alone [151,
154, 167, 172, 199]. However, once the one-pion exchange (OPE) potentials were included, only one solution could be found, suggesting
that Pc¯c(4440) and Pc¯c(4457) couple dominantly to the Σc ¯D∗with quantum numbers JP = 3
