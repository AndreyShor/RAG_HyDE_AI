Abstract 
Significance: Multi-layer (two- and three-layer) diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) models improve cerebral 
blood flow index (CBFi) measurement sensitivity and mitigate interference from extracerebral tissues. However, their 
reliance on multiple predefined parameters (e.g., layer thickness, optical properties) and high computational load limits 
their feasibility for real-time bedside monitoring. 
Aim: To develop a fast, accurate DCS data processing method based on the two-layer DCS analytical model, enabling 
real-time cerebral perfusion monitoring with enhanced brain sensitivity. 
Approach: We employed deep learning (DL) to accelerate DCS data processing. Unlike previous DCS networks 
trained on single-layer models, our network learns from the two-layer DCS analytical model, capturing extracerebral 
vs. cerebral dynamics. Realistic noise was estimated from subject-specific baseline measurements using a 512×512 
SPAD array at a large source-detector separation (35 mm). The model was evaluated on test datasets simulated with 
a four-layer slab head model via Monte Carlo (MC) methods and compared against conventional single-exponential 
fitting. An in-vivo brain activity experiment was also conducted to assess the real-world performance. 
Results: The proposed method bypasses traditional curve-fitting, achieved real-time monitoring of CBF changes at 
35 mm separation for the first time with a DL approach. Validation on MC simulations shows superior accuracy in 
relative CBFi estimation (5.8% error vs. 19.1% for fitting) and significantly enhanced CBFi sensitivity (87.1% vs. 
55.4%). Additionally, our method minimizes the influence of superficial blood flow and 750-fold faster than single-
exponential fitting in a realistic scenario. In-vivo testing further validated the method’s ability to support real-time 
cerebral perfusion monitoring and pulsatile waveform recovery. 
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that integrating DL with the two-layer DCS analytical model enables accurate, 
real-time cerebral perfusion monitoring without sacrificing depth sensitivity. The proposed method enhances CBFi 
sensitivity and recovery accuracy, supporting future deployment in bedside neuro-monitoring applications.
