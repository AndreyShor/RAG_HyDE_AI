Bloch Sphere Encoding. Given a mapping with 𝑘= 2 and a corresponding vector of angles 𝜃∈[0, 2𝜋), the
corresponding initial state for 𝐻Ising
𝐽
is
|𝜓𝑗⟩= cos

And, given a mapping with 𝑘= 3 and a corresponding vector of angles 𝜃∈[0, 𝜋],𝜙∈[0, 2𝜋)𝑛, the corresponding
initial state for 𝐻Ising
𝐽
is
|𝜓𝑗⟩= cos
𝜃𝑗

|0⟩+ 𝑒𝑖𝜙𝑗sin
𝜃𝑗

|1⟩.

We also use “vertex-at-top” rotations defined as follows (see [5, 6])
• If 𝑘= 2, a vertex-at-top rotation on qubit 𝑗applies the transformation 𝜃→𝜃−𝜃𝑗.
• If 𝑘= 3, a vertex-at-top rotation on qubit 𝑗applies a clockwise 𝑧-rotation by 𝜙𝑗, followed by a clockwise
𝑦-rotation by 𝜃𝑗, followed by a random 𝑧-rotation.
It can be easily verified that applying a vertex-at-top rotation to qubit 𝑗modifies the angles such that |𝜓𝑗⟩= |0⟩.
3.1.3
Dimension 𝑘Goemans Williamson (GW𝑘). While it’s clear how to construct initial states from the BM𝑘
relaxations, constructing initial states from the GW relaxation requires an additional step.
Following [5], for 𝑘= 2, 3 we sample random orthonormal bases {𝑥𝑖} of R𝑛and keep the first 𝑘. We then
project each vector 𝑌𝑖∈R𝑛onto the subspace generated by the basis {𝑥𝑖}, i.e., we define ˜𝑌𝑖∈R𝑘with compo-
nents
( ˜𝑌𝑖)𝑗=
𝑥𝑇
𝑗𝑌𝑖
√︃Í𝑘−1
𝑗=0 (𝑥𝑇
𝑗𝑌𝑖)2
.
(24)
This then gives a sequence of 𝑛𝑘-dimensional vectors as desired (or alternatively ˜𝑌∈R𝑘×𝑛).
Because the bases {𝑥𝑖} are randomly sampled, there’s no guarantee that a given one will sufficiently recover the
structure of {𝑌𝑖}, we randomly generate a fixed number of bases and choose the one that maximizes tr(𝐽𝑇, ˜𝑌𝑇˜𝑌).

Performance Metrics
To do so, we evaluate two metrics. The first is inspired by the cut ratio
𝛼Q =
⟨𝜓Q|𝐻Q
𝑄|𝜓Q⟩−𝐸Q
min
𝐸Q
max −𝐸Q
min
,
𝛼M =
⟨𝜓M|𝐻M
𝐴|𝜓M⟩−𝐸M
min
𝐸M
max −𝐸M
min
.

Notice that this comparison removes the affect of the constant difference in (8).
