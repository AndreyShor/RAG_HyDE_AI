in tandem with complementary cosmic distance indica-
tors— SNe data and the CMB acoustic scale θ∗—to test
for deviations from the ΛCDM paradigm. Employing a
shape-function approach [48, 49], we derived key observ-
ables sensitive to dark energy (DE) and found consistent
evidence for an evolving equation of state w(z) across
multiple, independent datasets.
Building on these findings, we performed a non-
parametric Bayesian reconstruction of w(z) by jointly
analyzing DESI BAO, SNe, and CMB data, employing a
correlation prior rooted in Horndeski theory. Our results
exhibit strong statistical support for dynamical dark en-
ergy, at a confidence level exceeding 3σ. Rigorous model
selection further indicates that DESI BAO, SNe, and
CMB observations together constrain roughly three inde-
pendent degrees of freedom (DoFs) without overfitting.
In particular, combining DESI BAO, CMB, and the five-
year DES supernova sample detects dark energy evolu-
tion at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.9, with a Bayesian evi-
dence of 5.2±0.7 in favor of w(z)CDM over ΛCDM when
Neff = 3.
These results suggest that dark energy may not be
described by a simple cosmological constant, favoring a
time-dependent equation of state w(z) instead. Although
earlier work [64] hinted at similar conclusions, this study
provides some of the tightest constraints to date, thanks
in large part to the enhanced statistical power of DESI
DR2 BAO data. Furthermore, adding supernova datasets
significantly boosts sensitivity to potential dark energy
evolution: all three independent SN samples (Pantheon-
Plus, Union3, and DESY5) show broadly consistent in-
dications of deviations from ΛCDM.
Companion DESI papers [44, 45] investigate the time
evolution of dark energy using complementary methods,
and also report the detection of the dynamical dark en-
ergy. The level of significance is generally greater in those
works because the full Planck measurements are used
there, as opposed to the θ∗information used in this
work. Moreover, the recent Atacama Cosmology Tele-
scope (ACT) results find that the time evolution of dark
energy is still favored when replacing the Planck data
with the ACT measurements [76].
Several challenges and open questions remain, for ex-
ample, systematics may be an issue. Future work should
focus on carefully quantifying and mitigating such effects
to ensure robust cosmological inferences. Nevertheless,
the level of consistency in these results means that the
survival of Λ will require multiple independent systemat-
ics to conspire in a common direction.
Looking ahead, forthcoming data will further test and
refine these findings. The complete DESI sample, with
increased statistical depth and extended redshift cov-
erage, is expected to yield even stricter constraints on
dark energy evolution. Additional surveys, such as Eu-
clid [77] and the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) [78],
will deliver complementary BAO and large-scale struc-
ture measurements, enabling cross-validation of DESI re-
sults. Likewise, next-generation CMB projects, including
CMB-S4 [79], will improve knowledge of early-universe
physics, strengthening the overall dark energy picture.
In conclusion, our study finds tentative evidence for de-
partures from ΛCDM using the DESI DR2 data. While
our results favor a dynamical dark energy interpretation,
continued observational and theoretical efforts will be
critical in establishing whether these deviations signify
new physics or stem from residual systematics. The com-
bined power of DESI Y5, forthcoming galaxy surveys,
and high-resolution CMB observations will be central to
decisively resolving the nature of dark energy and its role
in cosmic acceleration.
