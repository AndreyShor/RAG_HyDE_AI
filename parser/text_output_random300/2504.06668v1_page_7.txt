education and fertility, suggesting that expanded career opportunities and de-
layed childbearing contribute to this relationship. Vayena et al. (2023) discuss
the societal shift toward smaller family preferences due to modernization and
evolving social norms, as well as the rising cost of child-rearing—exacerbated
by urbanization and higher living standards—leading to a contraction in family
sizes. Furthermore, Zaghloul et al. (2021) note that the trend of later marriages
shortens the reproductive window, contributing to lower fertility rates.
Progress toward gender equality can also be seen as a contributing factor, as
it grants women greater autonomy over their reproductive choices, often leading
to delayed childbearing, which can impact fertility rates due to age-related
biological factors (Vayena et al., 2023). Both Hesketh and Xing (2020) and
Zaghloul et al. (2021) emphasize the increased availability and use of contra-
ception as a key factor empowering women to control their fertility. Finally,
Zaghloul et al. (2021) highlight improvements in healthcare and reductions in
child mortality rates as additional contributors to the global decline in fertility.
These factors interact in complex ways, with their relative importance
varying across regions and contexts. This highlights the necessity of modeling
specific drivers in different populations through the latent factors embedded in
the control parameters α and β of the fertility catastrophe model.

A Cusp Catastrophe-Agent Based Mathe-
matical Model of Teenage Pregnancy
To introduce complexity into an agent-based model (ABM) of teenage preg-
nancy, we consider multi-level dynamics incorporating socioeconomic environ-
ments, peer-group pressure through social connections, and feedback mecha-
nisms between these levels. Previous studies have proposed agent-based models
of family planning (O’Brien et al., 2023), the low fertility trap (Kim et al.,
2016), and changes in fertility rates (Singh et al., 2016). Teenage pregnancy
was modeled with ABM before by Barroso and Babanto (2016), but to the best
of our knowledge, no ABM model was combined before with Thom’s nonlinear
equations of morphogenesis.

Agents and Social Networks
Each agent Ai exists in a structured social network G = (V, E), where:
• V is the set of agents (vertices).
• E is the set of edges representing social connections between agents.
