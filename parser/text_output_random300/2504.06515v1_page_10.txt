4.2. Charged Particles
It is also possible to include non-gravitational interactions into the ROGS. Electro-
magnetism is an obvious choice to consider, and in fact the derivation of the canonically
reduced Hamiltonian for charged particles is parallel to that of the previous subsection for
the uncharged case [105]. Here, I shall highlight aspects of the charged case that are distinct
from the uncharged case.
The action integral for gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds coupled with N-
charged point masses is

where Aµ and F µν are the vector potential and the ﬁeld strength, and ea and τa are the
charge and the proper time of a-th particle, respectively. The ﬁeld equations that follow

whose conservation is guaranteed from (44). Note that, in (1 + 1) dimensions, no mag-
netic component of the ﬁeld exists. Inserting the trace of (44) into (43) yields (14), as
before. This equation, along with (45)–(47), form a closed system of equations for gravity,
electromagnetism, and charged N-body matter.
