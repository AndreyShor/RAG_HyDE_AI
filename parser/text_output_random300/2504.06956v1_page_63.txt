Proof of Proposition 6.1

Remark 7.7. The reason why, on the right-hand side of the previous display, we included the
seemingly redundant indicator function of the event {Mm,bt+1,bt −dt < −A} is due to a technicality
in the proof of Lemma 7.9 below. This will be better explained during the course of the proof of that
lemma.
Now, by introducing the following quantities,

(7.26)
one can easily check that,
E(7.18) = E(7.22) + E(7.23) −E(7.24) + E(7.25) −E(7.26) .
We will show that the fist term is dominant by separately bounding the sum of the second and third
term (since both terms are positive, this dominates their difference), as well as the difference between
the two last terms.
Lemma 7.8. For any λ > 0 and ε > 0, there exists a constant A ≥0 sufficiently large such that for
any s ≥0 sufficiently large satisfying (es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N, there exists T ≥0 sufficiently large
such that for any t ≥T, b ≥0, L ≥0, and χ : [0, R]d →R satisfying the conditions in (6.6), it holds
that
|E(7.25) −E(7.26)| ≤ερχ([0, R]d) .
Proof. Using the elementary inequality 1 −e−(u1+u2) ≤(1 −e−u1) + (1 −e−u2) which is valid for
u1, u2 ≥0, we note that for all m ∈SR,t, it holds that
1 −GR ≤(1 −G[0,R]d\Bbt(m)) + (1 −Gm,bt) .
Hence the claim is proved if we can show that there exists a constant A ≥0 sufficiently large such
that for any s ≥0 sufficiently large satisfying (es + 1)(R + 1)−1 ∈N, there exists T ≥0 sufficiently
large such that for any t ≥T, b ≥0, L ≥0, and χ : [0, R]d →R satisfying the conditions in (6.6), it
holds that

By bringing the indicator function of the complement of the event LA
m,bt inside the exponential, the
above expectation can be bounded from above by

and so the conclusion follows by choosing A ≥0 as in Lemma 7.5.
