in both locating and recognizing human activities.
5.7 Limitation Analysis
While this study introduces a novel multi-modal visual heat conduction model
as an efficient alternative to Transformer-based architectures for improved
human activity recognition, our current implementation does not fully exploit
the inherent advantages of event cameras (particularly their low latency and
high dynamic range) to optimize cross-modal fusion. Furthermore, this work
does not leverage additional textual semantic information or integrate large
language models to guide the multi-modal visual learning process. The incor-
poration of such techniques could potentially enhance the modelâ€™s ability to
better understand and align the visual and textual modalities. In our future
work, we aim to address these limitations by further optimizing the multi-
modal HCO model through integrating the advantages of event cameras, and
exploring the synergy between textual information and visual modalities, with
the goal of improving both efficiency and performance in multi-modal human
activity recognition tasks.
6 Conclusion and Future Works
In this paper, a novel RGB-Event based multi-modal human activity
recognition framework has been proposed, termed MMHCO-HAR. We begin
by exploring a heat conduction-based visual model and extend it to the
