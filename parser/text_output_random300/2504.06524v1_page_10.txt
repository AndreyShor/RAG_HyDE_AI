where k′ and k′′ are two arbitrary momenta. When ν = 1 mod 2, there is an odd number of zero-energy band crossings
between k′ and k′′ [73, 74]. Thus, the presence of zero-energy band crossings in the present system is protected by a
nontrivial Z2 invariant:
sgn
h
Pf( ˜Hkn+δk,s)Pf( ˜Hkn−δk,s)
i
= −1
(29)
where kn denotes the momenta at which zero-energy band crossing occurs and δk ≪1. These band crossings can only
be removed by perturbations that break the CP-like symmetry in Eq. (25). In our model, such symmetry breaking
is achieved by introducing the SOC term (i.e., λ ̸= 0), which inherently breaks the inversion symmetry in Eq. (23).

EFFECTIVE THEORY
A.
Low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian
We derive an eﬀective Hamiltonian for a quasi-one dimensional system with a unidirectional SOC potential of a
persistent spin texture and a dxy-wave pair potential. We begin with the BdG equation in Eq. (7) of the main text:

Hs(kx, y) = Hdxy

For later convenience, we transform the Hamiltonian into the chiral basis:
