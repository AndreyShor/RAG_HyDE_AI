It’s straightforward to see that the magnetic ﬁeld generated after the tachyonic phase is
much larger than that during the tachyonic phase because of c3 > T2 for the existence of
tachyonic ampliﬁcation. Similarly, we also organize the magnetic ﬁeld from (6.8) in Table.
2. In particular, in the Table. 1 we include the parameter sets that violate the condition
c2
1/c2 ≪1 for illustrative purposes. In Table 2 we include parameters that satisfy c2
1/c2 ≪1
only.

Table 2. Numerical result for c3 with diﬀerent value of v and T2. Here, we set Hinf = 1012GeV,
g∗= 106.75 and T1 = 0.1MeV. We also illustrate the value of B according to the parameter set in
(6.8).
Two comments are in order. Firstly, we have set g∗= 106.75 in the numerical evalu-
ation, however, this value may alter in diﬀerent cosmic epochs and that would bring us a
factor of order O(1) ∼O(10) error, which does not invalidate our magneto-genesis scenario.
Besides, in the above calculations we implicitly assume that k/a ≪̺T. This may not be
true for small ̺. For the typical scale kG, we have
kG
a ≪̺T →kG
aeq
≪̺Teq →̺ ≫

eq = 2.1 × 10−26 .

Thus the third case in Table. 2 marginally satisﬁes the criteria, and the fourth one violates
the assumption. If k/a ≫̺T, the gradient energy density of φ dominates and the result
should have scale dependence when expressed by r. For our purpose, we are interested in
proposing a viable scenario for magneto-genesis so the k/a ≪̺T case is suﬃcient. The
case k/a ≫̺T may lead to a diﬀerent spectra index of magnetic power spectrum are will
be interesting to study in future works.
