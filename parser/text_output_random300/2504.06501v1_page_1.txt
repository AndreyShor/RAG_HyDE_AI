Equivalent Circuit Modeling of a Lumped-element Loaded Metasurface
under Arbitrary Incidence and Polarization
Athanasios Nousiou, Nikolaos V. Kantartzis, and Alexandros Pitilakis
Abstract—In recent years, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)
have emerged as a key technology for next-generation communication,
offering real-time and dynamic control over electromagnetic wave char-
acteristics. The scattering of an RIS unit cell can be effectively modeled
using an equivalent circuit model (ECM) of a lumped RLC-loaded meta-
surface. However, existing ECMs, particularly those with square patches,
often fail to generalize beyond specific configurations or integrate lumped
elements, limiting their practical applicability to single polarization or
normal incidence. In this work, we propose a simple yet robust ECM that
accurately predicts the spectral response while maintaining adaptability
across varying design parameters, including polarization, arbitrary angles
of incidence, and physical dimensions of lumped elements. Our approach
is built incrementally, starting from a 1×1 unit cell as the fundamental
structure and extending to 2×1 and 2×2 cell configurations. The 2×2
cell structure allows for multifunctionality and reconfigurability in dual
independent polarizations. These capabilities facilitate the realization of
vector holographic metasurfaces. Validation with full-wave simulations
demonstrates strong agreement, highlighting the efficiency and robustness
of our model. This work lays the foundation for simplified and effective
RIS modeling and optimization in advanced communication systems.

I. INTRODUCTION

ETASURFACES are engineered 2D materials composed of
subwavelength-scale particles that, when properly designed,
enable precise control over electromagnetic wave properties such as
amplitude, phase, reflection, and polarization [1], [2]. Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), a subset of metasurfaces, dynamically ma-
nipulate wavefronts in real time, creating programmable environments
that enhance wireless communication [3]–[5]. RIS technology is cen-
tral to next-generation systems like 5G and 6G, addressing traditional
system limitations by improving performance, energy efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness [6], [7]. Beyond telecommunications, metasurfaces
have applications in sensing, imaging, and stealth, demonstrating their
broad scientific impact.
Despite the disruptive potential of RIS, the metasurface unit
cell design and analysis still relies heavily on full-wave numeri-
cal simulation [8]. Thus, a key challenge is the development of
generalized equivalent circuit models (ECMs) for metasurfaces with
reconfigurable lumped elements, like varactor diodes. Existing ECMs
[9]–[13], often structure-specific and limited to a single polarization
(TE or TM) and/or to normal incidence, restrict broader applicability.
While full-wave simulations (FWS) provide high accuracy, ECMs
remain essential for intuitive understanding, rapid tuning, and initial
design optimization. The absence of a simple yet accurate ECM
hinders efficient development of versatile RIS structures.
This work addresses this necessity by introducing a simplified
yet comprehensive ECM for metasurfaces composed of square patch
grids with lumped elements ‘loading’ the gaps, accommodating both
TE and TM polarizations at oblique incidence angles. The ECM
builds upon transmission line (TL) theory and incorporates the
dispersive surface impedance of the patterned and loaded metallic

layers. Our model integrates key parameters such as unit cell period,
substrate properties, patch gaps, lumped element values (resistance
and capacitance) and physical dimensions, incidence angle, and polar-
ization. Balancing simplicity and accuracy, it maintains a resonance-
frequency error below 20% between analytical and simulated results
which holds for oblique incidence angles up to 60◦, corresponding
to the practical range in most applications. While designed for a
specific grid type, this framework extends to more complex unit cells,
accelerating RIS design. Importantly, our approach systematically
evolves from fundamental (1 × 1 cell [14]) to advanced (2 × 2
cell [15]) structures, without relying on parameter retrieval or fitting
from measurements or FWS and circuit simulators. The versatile unit
cell architectures we study support multi-functionality (simultaneous
amplitude and phase control), reconfigurability (independent tuning
of unit cells), and dual polarization (independent responses along x
and y axes). operation These features pave the way for the streamlined
design of vector holographic metasurfaces [16] for advanced wireless
applications.
The paper is structured as follows: Following this introduction,
Section II presents the unit cell architectures considered in this
work and outlines the analytical tools used to model their response
in progressively more complex configurations. Section III contains
the comparison of ECM and FWS predicted responses for various
metasurface functionalities. Section IV holds the conclusion and
future prospects of this work.
II. ARCHITECTURE AND METHODOLOGY
A. Unit Cell Architecture
The reflective metasurfaces studied in this work consist of a peri-
odic repetition of subwavelength elements on a grounded dielectric
substrate, where geometrical shapes (e.g., squares, crosses, rings)
determine electromagnetic wave manipulation. By selecting element
shapes, arrangement, and substrate properties, metasurfaces control
the scattered wave magnitude and phase. Similar control is achievable
by integrating tunable elements, like varactors or varistors [8], while
maintaining the same geometry. Some simple yet flexible designs,
Fig. 1, include unit cells with the following configurations:
• 1 × 1 Cell: Square patch grid connected by lumped elements in
one or two lateral dimensions; ideal for dual-polarization control
but only for global tuning (suffers from cross-talk between
adjacent cells in individual tuning).
• 2 × 1 Cell: Pairs of patches connected by a lumped element in
one dimension; minimizes aforementioned cross-talk but affords
control in one plane only.
• 2 × 2 Cell: Extension of the 2 × 1 configuration in two
dimensions; allows for independent control in two planes.
By tuning the resistance and capacitance of the lumped loads,
desired amplitude and phase characteristics can be achieved, pro-
vided adjacent cells exhibit minimal coupling. These values can be
implemented using tunable varistors and varactors, enabling real-
time dynamic control. This precision allows metasurfaces to shape
reflected wavefronts for applications like beam steering, focusing, and
interference pattern generation. Additionally, incorporating different
