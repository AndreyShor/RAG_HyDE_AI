The intriguing aspect was the shape of the spectrum in the time interval 8 −30 s, as shown
in the a and b panels of Figure 2, revealing a distinct narrow and bright emission feature between
1 MeV and 3 MeV, this feature did not appear in the other four spectra. We further analyzed
the GRBs data detected by the Fermi satellite within ten days before and after the explosion of
GRB 221023A. For each of these events, we performed time-resolved spectral analysis using dif-
ferent signal-to-noise ratios and Bayesian blocks, no similar narrow feature were found in these
GRBs. In order to model the narrow emission feature observed at MeV energies, we incorporated
a blackbody component into the Band function. However, Blackbody component is not enough
narrow to properly fit the narrow emission feature. Therefore, we introduced an additional Gaus-
sian component to fit the spectrum of the time interval 8 −30 s. The Gaussian function is defined
as follows:
Ngauss(E) = A
1
σgauss
√
2πexp
−(E −Egauss)2
2 (σgauss)2

.

where A is the normalization of spectrum, Egauss and σgauss are the central energy and standard
deviation of the Gaussian function. We have found that the Gaussian component is well constrained
at Egauss = 2154.60+53.37
−65.07 keV, with a width σgauss = 229.36+93.57
−45.29 keV. The fitting results of the
spectrum are presented in Table 1. The c and d panels of Figure 2 displays the counts rate and νFν
spectrum, with fitting using the Band function plus a Gaussian component. From the light curve
presented in the (a) and (b) panel of Figure 1, the MeV narrow emission feature appears during
the rising and falling phases of the main pulse. When compared to other time intervals (0 −5 s,
5 −8 s, 30 −36 s and 36 −60 s), the time interval 8 −30 s exhibits the highest flux and the best
signal-to-noise ratio. The evolution of the spectral parameters of the Band function in the best-fit
model is shown in the (c), (d), and (e) panels of Figure 1. The low-energy spectral index α evolved
from -0.88 to -1.33, indicating an evolution from hard to soft. Additionally, the peak energy Ep
varies between 397 keV and 920 keV, showing the pattern of intensity tracking51.
For the A (0 −5 s), B (5 −8 s), D (30 −36 s) and E (36 −60 s) time intervals, we
fixed the line width at σgauss = 200 keV and the line central energy at Egauss = 2.1 MeV
in the likelihood fit, thereby deriving the upper limits on the flux of the narrow emission fea-
ture, which are Fluxgauss < 5.1 × 10−7 erg cm−2 s−1, Fluxgauss < 3.2 × 10−7 erg cm−2 s−1,
Fluxgauss < 2.4 × 10−7 erg cm−2 s−1, and Fluxgauss < 9.9 × 10−8 erg cm−2 s−1, respectively.
Model comparison. We employed three different methods to assess the necessity of adding a
Gaussian component to the prompt gamma-ray spectrum of GRB 221023A.
The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is employed for model comparison when penaliz-
ing additional free parameters is necessary to prevent overfitting. The AIC is formulated as the
