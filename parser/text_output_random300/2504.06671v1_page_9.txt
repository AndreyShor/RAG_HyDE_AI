while lowercase letters denote whether the double layers and their immediate surroundings follow a cubic (k) or 
hexagonal (h) stacking order. Green lowercase letter pairs represent variants of a pair defect. Figure taken from Ref. 
[51]. 
 
Figure 5 shows the structure of VSi and VC-VSi in 4H-SiC. Divacancy has four, denoted as hh,kk,hk and kh 
while silicon vacancy has two non-equivalent sites denoted as k and h.
