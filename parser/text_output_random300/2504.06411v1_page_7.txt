Proof. First suppose U is a precompact coordinate ball and identify U with the open ball Br(0) of radius r and
centered at 0. Given s > 0 let (gn) be a sequence in C∞(R) such that gn is supported in (0, s+1) for every n and
gn →1(0,s] pointwise. Then gn(t)δΓ|T
t
is a ( ¯U, T) variation of Γ. Using the fact that gn is of bounded variation,
the Itˆo dominated convergence theorem and Proposition 5.3 of L´azaro-Cam´ı and Ortega [2], we obtain

Moreover, since δΓ|T vanishes outside [[τ h

Let 0 < η < r and h ∈C∞(Rn) be supported on Br(0) with h| ¯
Bη(0) = 1, where ¯Bη(0) denotes the closed ball
of radius η centered at 0. For j = 1, · · · , n, let ˜X denote the vector field on R defined by ˜Xj = h(x)ej. Then
˜Xj vanishes on the boundary ∂¯Br(0) of ¯Br(0) = ¯U. Extending ˜Xj| ¯U to a vector field X on M by setting X = 0
outside U and letting g ∈C∞(M) be supported on (0, T), we can construct a ( ¯U, T)-deformation ϵ 7→Γϵ with
variation g(t)X(Γt) by the admissibility hypothesis.
Since

that

Bη(0), τ h

Bη(0) + τ (h,e)

previous equality and the fact that X(Γ|T ) = g(t)ej on [[τ h
¯
Bη(0), τ h
¯
Bη(0) + τ (h,e)
¯
Bη(0)]] implies that
Z
1[[τ h

Bη(0)+τ (h,e)

Bη(0)]]g(t) ◦dZj = 0
for all g ∈C∞(R) supported on (0, T).
Pick an arbitrary s ∈(0, T). Replacing g by ˜gn where (˜gn) is a sequence in C∞(R) that is supported on (0, T)
and ˜gn →1(0,s], we get
0 =
