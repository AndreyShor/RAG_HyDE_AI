It remains to indicate how to determine the above roots. We have given a full account
of this in the λ-analysis. Here we consider the case of the escape orbit where we have
an unstable circular orbit at r = r1 for E ∼0.
From Taylor’s theorem
QB(u) = (u −u1)2q(u),
where q is the quadratic

as one expects from the Puiseux series. Knowing the sum and product of the roots from
QB(u) gives us the first order corrections for the remaining roots as Puiseux demands.

We note that, when C6 ∼

4 µ2B2, Veff(r1) ∼0, in which case the energy E ∼0
corresponds to an unstable circular orbit with radius r1. The condition C6 > 729
4 µ2B2
can give one or two wells depending upon the energy E which we assume here is
negative. This is explained in our graphical analysis. The point is that the graphs,
y1 = Veff(r) and y2 = E have 4 points of intersection u = a, b, c, d, u = 1
r, where we
assume a > b > c > d > 0 for V +
eff(min) < E < 0 and only a, b giving 2 points of
intersection if V −

eff(min) < 0,
