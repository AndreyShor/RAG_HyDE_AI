HEAs have demonstrated critical current densities (Jc) comparable to those of com-
mercial Nb-Ti superconducting wires[49, 54, 55]. In conventional bcc superconducting
alloys, Nb–47 wt.%Ti is widely utilized for superconducting wires[56, 57]. The fab-
rication process typically involves heat treatments ranging from 380 to 420 ◦C for
40 to 80 hours[56, 57]. Following the ﬁnal heat treatment, a strain of 330–450 % is
applied[56, 57]. This intricate fabrication procedure induces nanoscale α-Ti precipi-
tates that serve as eﬀective pinning sites. An example of this microstructure is shown in
Fig. 1[58], where α-Ti forms ribbon-like features approximately 5 nm thick, with 10–30
nm spacings. This nanoscale microstructure underpins the high Jc values, exceeding
105 A/cm2, which meet the practical requirements[49, 59, 60], even under elevated
magnetic ﬁelds. The relationships between Jc and microstructural features have also
been examined in recent studies on bcc HEA superconductors[54, 55, 61], a central
focus of this review. Additionally, as previously noted, the unique multifunctional-
ity of HEAs is rarely observed in conventional alloys such as Nb-Ti. The bcc HEA
superconductors exhibiting high Jc values discussed in this review show considerable
promise for practical applications in extreme environments, such as aerospace and
nuclear fusion reactors, owing to the inherent high irradiation resistance of HEAs[62].
Consequently, investigating Jc of bcc HEA superconductors remains a vital area of
research.

damental superconducting properties and the magnetic ﬁeld performance of Jc. A
comparative analysis of Jc among the representative bcc HEAs surveyed in this review
is also presented. Finally, we address future perspectives on the practical application
of these materials as superconducting wires.
