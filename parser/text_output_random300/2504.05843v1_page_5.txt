Then the number of solutions to the simultaneous conditions ˆωs = 0 = ˆωt indicates the number of master
integrals [17]. In our example there are seven.
The decomposition will require two steps: we first single out one of the integrations to start with, say, in
the variable s. Regarding any form ϕL as some coefficient only depending on t and a one-form in s, we should
be able to express it in terms of a basis of master one-forms w.r.t. s. Here the relevant number of masters is
given by the number of zeroes of the first condition in (18) only. In our application there will be three masters
{e1, e2, e3} which are one-forms in s. We will choose

Note that the second and third masters have simple poles only in both parameters s, t. In view of the second
integration step in the variable t we have introduced the denominator factor 1 −t into the first factor. Such
dLog masters are desirable to limit the computational effort, see below.
If anything works, it must be so that

where hi are three right masters. It is not necessary to have equal left and right forms but it will be most
convenient to identify the two bases.
The pairing (in our case a 3 × 3 matrix)
Cs = ⟨ei|hj⟩
(21)
of intersection numbers is defined as follows: we determine the total set of poles {s1 . . . sk} in s (these may
depend on outer variables as well as t) coming from the collection of denominators. For each pole we replace
s →sm +x with a new variable x in which we Taylor expand. The covariant derivative wrt. to s is defined by
the partial derivative acting under the integral, where the effect of the differentiation on w creates a connection
term:
∇s = ∂v + ˆωs
(22)
We next define a potential for every ei in a neighbourhood of a pole sm: let us write ei = ˆei ds, so as in
the beginning of the section hatting expresses the omission of the differential. Assuming the expansion of
ˆei|s = sm+x to start at a minimal power minm −1 and that we can truncate at some maximum maxm we define
the potential as
ψi,m =
maxm
X
n = minm
c(n)

(23)
and solve
(∂s + ˆωs|s = sm+x) ψi,m = ˆei|s = sm+x
(24)
comparing the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the two sides from minm −1 to maxm −1. Finally, the
intersection number is:
Cs =
k
X
m = 1
res|s = sm ψi,m ˆhj|s = sm+x
(25)
It follows that maxm + 1 is the negative of the minimal order of ˆhj in the region m. It is advisable to choose
the masters such that the range of powers in the potentials is minimised. In practice this implies to prefer
masters with simple poles only. We emphasise that the pole at infinity has to be taken account by the rule
s →1/x because the problem is projective in nature. These arguments point at dLog masters as the preferred
choice.
For a basis of masters, Cs will be invertible. In our example, the inverse C−1

is nicer than Cs itself:
