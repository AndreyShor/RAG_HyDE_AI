However, note that (UL(R))†UL(R) ̸= I since the left and right sets themselves are not orthonormal.
Importantly, for bi-orthonormal systems the identity can be resolved as,
1 =
X
j
|ϕj⟩⟨ϕj|RL .
(S.8)
One issue with the bi-orthonormalization procedure is that it requires a non-degenerate eigenspectrum [1]. In gen-
eral, degeneracies can arise in three ways: (i) due to symmetries of the system; (ii) accidental degeneracies; and (iii)
emergent degeneracies. For degeneracies due to exact symmetries of the bare Hamiltonian, the solution is to label
states by their associated conserved quantum numbers and block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian separately in each quan-
tum number subspace. A bi-orthonormal basis can then be defined separately in each block and different degenerate
components of a symmetry multiplet are treated independently. For accidental degeneracies, often numerical error
even at machine precision level is sufficient to distinguish states and eliminate problems with bi-orthonormalization.
These issues were discussed in a different context for NRG calculations in Ref. [3]. We note that the procedure is
stabilized by simply using 128-bit precision numerics, which is typically enough to distinguish accidental degeneracies,
which are of course always approximate in practice. Another simple solution is to add to the Hamiltonian a physi-
cally inconsequential disorder perturbation of very small magnitude, which has the effect of lifting the degeneracies.
Finally, in the context of quantum impurity problems, we note that low-energy fixed points can have larger emergent
symmetries than the bare model Hamiltonian. For example the one-channel, spin- 1
2 anisotropic Kondo model has an
isotropic strong coupling stable fixed point [4]; whereas the two-channel Kondo model has a large emergent SO(8)
symmetry at its critical point [5]. In these cases, one might expect additional degeneracies that cannot be separated
into distinct quantum number blocks. However, these emergent symmetries only pertain asymptotically after very
many NRG iterations, and at low energies. In practice, the degeneracies near the fixed point are always approximate
and again, the use of high-precision numerics solves the problem.

ITERATIVE CONSTRUCTION AND DIAGONALIZATION IN NH-NRG
In the following we assume that left and right vectors of NH matrices are bi-orthonormal. The NRG procedure is
defined by the recursion relation,
ˆHN+1 = ˆHN + ˆTN+1
(S.9)
which is initialized by ˆH0, consisting of the impurity degrees of freedom and the Wilson chain ‘zero’ orbital. Here the
operator ˆTN+1 = ˆT a
N+1 + ˆT b
N+1 + ˆT c
N+1 is defined by,
ˆT a
N+1 = ϵN+1

At step N + 1 of the iterative diagonalization process, we add on the new Wilson chain site |k⟩N+1, where the index
k = {0, −1, +1, 2} labels the four possible configurations of that site, |k⟩N+1 = {|−⟩, |↓⟩, |↑⟩, |↑↓⟩} respectively. Since
the part of the Hamiltonian describing the Wilson chain is Hermitian, the left and right eigenstates for the isolated
Wilson orbital |k⟩N+1 are equal and so we do not specify a L, R superscript. At this step we need to construct the
Hamiltonian matrix Hb
N+1 with the following matrix elements,
[Hb
N+1]kr,k′r′ = ⟨N + 1; k; r|L
b ˆHN+1 |N + 1; k′; r′⟩R
b
(S.11)
where the b subscript denotes that these are basis states (rather than eigenstates), which are decomposed as,
|N + 1; k; r⟩L(R)
b
= |k⟩N+1 ⊗|N; r⟩L(R)
d
(S.12)
for left(right) basis states. The latter are given in terms of the left(right) eigenstates in the diagonal representation
(d subscript) of the previous iteration, denoted |N; r⟩L(R)
d
. Therefore, these satisfy ˆHN |N; r⟩R
d = EN(r) |N; r⟩R
d and
⟨N; r|L
d ˆHN = ⟨N; r|L
d EN(r) where EN(r) are the complex eigenvalues of the previous iteration.
We therefore have four terms to compute from Eqs. (S.9), (S.10):
⟨k|N+1 ⟨N; r|L
d ˆHN |k′⟩N+1 |N; r′⟩R
