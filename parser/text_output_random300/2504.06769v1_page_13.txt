Fig. 7. Evolutionary dynamics for PGG with sigmoid benefit function B(τi) =
b
1+exp(−βsig(τi−T )). The top row shows the evolutionary
dynamics of the trait distribution for 0 < T < n/2, and the bottom row corresponds to n/2 < T < n. The singular strategies (the
dashed vertical lines) are indicated where appropriate. The grey lines correspond to the ESS, while the black lines represent the repellor. (a)
Evolutionarily stable singular strategy (x0 = 0.1) exists. (b) Repellor and ESS coexist; depending on the initial conditions, the population
either evolves to full defection (x0 = 0.2) or ESS (x0 = 0.3). (c) Repellor and ESS coexist; depending on the initial conditions, the population
either evolves to full defection (x0 = 0.3) or ESS (x0 = 0.5). (d) The existence of repellor happens; depending on the initial conditions,
the population either evolves to zero investment (x0 = 0.6) or full investment (x0 = 0.8). The grey and black dashed lines represent the
theoretically calculated values of ESS and repellor, respectively. Parameter values: T = 1, b = 50, and x∗
1 ≈0.434088 in panel (a); T = 2,
b = 10, and x∗
1 ≈0.231228, x∗
2 ≈0.568772 in panel (b); T = 3, b = 20, and x∗
1 ≈0.402912, x∗
2 ≈0.797088 in panel (c); T = 5, b = 80,
and x∗
2 ≈0.747026 in panel (d). Other parameters: n = 5, βsig = 5, c = 1, and ω = 1.
