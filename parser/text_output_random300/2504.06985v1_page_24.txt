where F ≡i F/2π and the l-th Chern character will be denoted as chl,r(F) = chl,r rather than
specifically in terms of traces of powers of the field strength. These characters can be related
to Chern classes ci,r(F), see, e.g. [62].
We will focus on simple algebras in this appendix, so the problem of anomaly factorization
demands dealing with the following trace identities for an arbitrary representation r of a simple
gauge group
trr F 6 = u(1)
r tr F 6 + u(2)
r (tr F 4)(tr F 2) + u(3)
r (tr F 2)3 + u(4)
r (tr F 3)2
trr F 4 = u(5)
r tr F 4 + u(6)
r (tr F 2)2 ,
trr F 2 = u(7)
r tr F 2 ,

where the coefficients u(i)
r
are related to eigenvalues of Casimir invariants or equivalently to
2nth (modified) order index. Our main task is to compute those coefficients. Note also that
the coefficient u(4)
r
is only present for An−1 algebras with n > 2. For exceptional algebras,
these coefficients can be found in [38, 40] which we summarize in table 8.
It is quite convenient to determine the coefficients u(i)
r
for An−1 algebras using the Chern
character and useful properties that obey under direct sum and tensor product of represen-
tations, namely
chr1⊕r2(F) = chr1(F) + chr2(F) ,
(B.5)
chr1⊗r2(F) = chr1(F) chr2(F) .
(B.6)
Afterwards, we can use the information obtained for An−1 to analyze the algebras Bn, Cn,
and Dn using branching rules of representations. Unfortunately, we find that this method is
only efficient for algebras with n ≥6.
What makes these properties of the Chern character particularly useful for representations
of SU(n) is the fact that we can express Chern characters of symmetric and anti-symmetric
representations in terms of a defining representation. Eventually, we will manage to determine
the group-theoretical coefficients u(i)
r
of the traces above. This is done using the following

where [m] and (m) denote (anti)-symmetrized representations where the Chern character is
evaluated. These are irreducible representations for SU(n) using as reference representation
its fundamental representation. For instance, if we denote by V the fundamental of SU(n),
then the representation [m] can be thought of as an element of the exterior algebra Λ(V ) =
