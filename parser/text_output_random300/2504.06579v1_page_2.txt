1. Introduction
Isolated quantum systems evolve coherently according to the Schrödinger equation [1]. A
central focus in contemporary quantum research concerns study of open quantum systems [2]
and in particular the issue of how coupling a quantum system to an external environment
affects quantum coherence and introduces the undesirable effects of decoherence [3,4]. This
question is especially relevant in the context of quantum technology [5], and has gained further
importance thanks to recent experimental advances in atomic, molecular, and optical systems
that allow for controlled investigation of nonequilibrium dynamics of open quantum many-
body systems [6–10].
There are two primary approaches to studying the dynamics of an open quantum system,
in the Schrödinger picture. The more conventional method involves formulating an effective
description for the time evolution of the density operator of the system via a quantum master
equation, typically in the form of the so-called Lindblad equation [2, 11, 12]. This approach
relies on several uncontrolled approximations, such as assuming weak coupling between the
system and the environment, as well as a clear separation of time scales between the intrinsic
dynamics of the system and that of the environment. The second approach is motivated
by standard experimental protocols, wherein the evolution of a quantum system alternates
between intervals of effective isolation and intervals during which environmental interactions
affect its dynamics. A common example is shot noise, which randomly disrupts the unitary
evolution of the system [13, 14]. This type of dynamics is modeled as unitary evolution
interrupted at random times by non-unitary evolution due to interactions with the environment.
As a result, the system undergoes a sequence of unitary evolutions that are stochastically
modulated over time [15–22]. In this framework, no assumptions are required regarding the
strength of the coupling to the environment, and the approximation of time-scale separation
