FIG. S10: The lattice models feature flux patterns that realize all k-space Biebarbach groups except P1. Specifically, these
models correspond to (a) k-sapce Pc, (b) k-space Cc, (c) k-space Pca21, (d) k-space Pna21, (e) k-space P212121, (f) k-space
P21, (g) k-space P31, (h) k-space P41, (i) k-space P61. In each lattice model, the unit cell is outlined by a green dashed box.
The blue-shaded regions in (a-f), (h) and (I) exhibit fluxes of π mod 2π. The purple shaded regions in (f) and (h) have fluxes
2π/3. The yellow and green shaded regions in (g) represent fluxes π/2 and 3π/2, respectively. Additionally, sites with different
on-site energies are represented in two different colors.
The lattice models corresponding to k-space P31 and P61 are illustrated in Figs. S10(f) and (h). The model shown
in Fig. S10(f) is constructed from a trigonal lattice and obeys real space P3 symmetry, while the model in Fig. S10(h)
is based on a hexagonal lattice and adheres to real space P6 symmetry. Both models contain 12 sites in the unit
cell and share the same flux configuration, with fluxes passing through planes parallel to the z-axis. The surfaces
between cells in the z-direction, indicated in purple, contain a 2π/3 flux. The regions labeled in blue represent π
fluxes. Therefore, 3-fold and 6-fold rotation symmetries now don’t commute with translation symmetry Lz, instead
they contribute to fractional translations in momentum space.
The last model of k-space P41 is illustrated in Fig. S10(g). This model is constructed from a tetragonal lattice and
contains 8 sites in the unit cell. Fluxes are arranged in a stripe distribution across the x-z and y-z planes. As shown
in Fig. S10(g), the regions labeled in green and yellow represent π/2 and 3π/2 fluxes, respectively.
