is obtained by optimizing both parameters starting from an initial
value of zero:
Enoisy

= ⟨φHF|e−τJ(θJ)e−τK(θK) ˆHeτK(θK)eτJ(θJ) |φHF⟩(initial −point = [0,0])

Next, we consider the mitigation procedure for circuits parameterized by three operators, where the ansatz is defined as
|ψ⟩= eτLeτKeτJ |φHF⟩. Following a similar strategy as before, we construct a three-parameter energy functional. Here, we
optimize θL as the sole variational parameter while fixing the other parameters θJ and θK at their previously optimized values,
¯θ

J and ¯θ
′
K respectively. The energy evaluated under noise with this single-parameter optimization for the operator τL is given by
EJKL = ⟨φHF|e−τJ( ¯θ

J)e−τK( ¯θ
′
K)e−τL(θL) ˆHeτL(θL)eτK( ¯θ

K)eτJ( ¯θ

J) |φHF⟩
(10)
Similarly, as discussed above the noisy reference energy for the three-parameter circuit is defined as
(E0
L)JK = ⟨φHF|e−τJ( ¯θ
′
J)e−τK( ¯θ
′
K)e−τL(θL=0) ˆHeτL(θL=0)eτK( ¯θ
′
K)eτJ( ¯θ
′
J) |φHF⟩
(11)
where, (...)JK suggests that the reference state is taken as eτJ( ¯θ
′
J)eτK( ¯θ
′
K) |φHF⟩. Therefore, the deviation in the reference state
energy for the three-parameter circuit is expressed as
∆re f
JKL = ESREM
JK
−(E0
L)JK
(12)
the mitigated energy with respect to the noise for the one-parameter optimization of τL, becomes
EEM
JKL = EJKL +∆re f
JKL.

Finally, all three parameters are released as free variational parameters. The energy functional is then re-optimized, starting from
their previously determined optimal values, yielding
E

JKL = ⟨φHF|e−τJ(θJ)e−τK(θK)e−τL(θL) ˆHeτL(θL)eτK(θK)eτJ(θJ) |φHF⟩
