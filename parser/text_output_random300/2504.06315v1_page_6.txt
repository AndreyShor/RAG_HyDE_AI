Model parameterization and numerical methods
In this section, we outline the key physiological parameters used in the model, including their baseline values for the
numerical simulations. We start by providing in Table 1 a list of the model state variables, together with the associated
initial conditions employed in the simulations.
Next, parameters are categorized into cardiovascular system, heart system, ocular hemodynamics, and cardiovascular-
ocular connections and listed in Table 2. These parameters influence the dynamics of blood flow and pressure, as well
as the resistance and compliance in different vascular compartments. The initial conditions and parameter values in
this study have been calibrated to ensure baseline flow and pressure consistency in the ocular system. To establish
reliable estimates for vascular resistances, preliminary computations were performed under steady-state conditions.
