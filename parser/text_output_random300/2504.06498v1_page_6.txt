160 ms delay, 𝜋/2 phase lag at 1-𝐽) and 2-𝐽(Fig. 2F, 222 ms delay, 𝜋/2 phase advance at 2-𝐽)
transitions, respectively. In both plots, the steady-state amplitudes initially rise with increasing
the feedback gain but decline at higher gains, mirroring the conventional maser/laser dynamics
where output peaks at an optimized resonator quality factor (33). This non-monotonic behavior
aligns with minima observed in Fig. 2C and 2D at phase shifts of ±𝜋/2 (e.g., 150 ms for 1-𝐽and
220 ms for 2-𝐽transitions). At higher gains, the maximal amplitude of the first burst plateaus as the
hyperpolarization-driven population imbalance is converted into coherences.
The generated 𝐽-oscillations are influenced by two contributions: the passive magnetic intrinsic
gain of the system 𝐺int and the actively applied “effective external feedback gain,” 𝐺ext sin 𝜑. The
intrinsic gain 𝐺int, which is analogous to the conventional gain definition in laser physics (see
Ref. (9)), quantifies the ability of the system to amplify magnetic fields. Specifically, the intrinsic
gain 𝐺int is defined as the ratio between the amplitude of the magnetic field produced by the sample
(as measured by the optical magnetometer, OPM) and the amplitude of the externally applied AC
field that acts on the sample (see SI for additional details). For sustained quantum oscillations
to emerge spontaneously, the total gain from combined internal and external contributions must
exceed unity:
|𝐺ext · sin 𝜑· 𝐺int| > 1.

In the cases shown in Figs. 2E and 2F, the feedback delays are explicitly chosen so that the phase
lags match 𝜑= 3𝜋/2, resulting in | sin 𝜑| = 1. For instance, delays of 160 ms are set for the 1-𝐽
transition (Fig. 2E) and 222 ms for the 2-𝐽transition (Fig. 2F). Based on the numerical simulations
illustrated in Figs. 2E-F, the threshold external gains 𝐺th
ext required to initiate sustained oscillations
are approximately 7.2 for the 1-𝐽transition and 5.8 for the 2-𝐽transition (as highlighted by the
shaded areas in the respective figures). Additionally, simulations of the exact same modeled spin
systems yield intrinsic gain values 𝐺int of approximately 0.138 and 0.172 for the 1-𝐽and 2-𝐽
transitions, respectively (see Fig. S5 and SI for detailed numerical procedures). Overall, these
extracted values meet the theoretical threshold condition defined by Eq. 1.
By tunning the external feedback gain, it is possible to achieve quantum oscillators under
challenging conditions such as low molar polarization (product of molecular concentration and
nuclear polarization) or rapid relaxation, where intrinsic gain alone would be insufficient to initiate
the emergence of the oscillator (13). Increasing the external feedback gain (𝐺ext) effectively lowers
