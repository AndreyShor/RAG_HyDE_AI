Under standard conditions the cupula is neutrally buoyant, so that the solid density is
𝜌𝑠= 1000 Kg·m−3.
The most challenging parameters to identify are 𝐵and 𝑇. We can infer the value of the
bending stiffness from the results of Selva et al. (2009), who suggest an extremely low value
of the Young’s modulus, 𝐸∼5 Pa. Other authors quote simply an estimate for the bending
stiffness, 𝐵∼10−10 N m (Rabbitt & Damiano 1992). Since the cupula is difficult to access
and measure, determining the pretension 𝑇is significantly more challenging and typically
requires detailed experiments. However, incorporating 𝑇> 0 adds no additional complexity
to our method of solution, and so we retain it for completeness; the effect of this tension is
characterized through the inverse bendability parameter, 𝑏= 𝐵/(𝑇𝑎2) (Davidovitch et al.
2011). We refer to the limit 𝑏→∞as the plate regime and 𝑏→0 as the membrane regime.
In terms of the motion, usual ranges of operation for humans are ¤Ω0 ∼1 s−2 and T can be
anywhere between 0.01 and 10 seconds. We are now in a position to make informed estimates
of the sizes of the dimensionless groups appearing in (2.12)-(2.13). Both the Stokes number
and the relative stiffness 𝜅depend on the forcing time scale T. In particular, St ≪1 for
T > 1, but the Stokes number may be large for faster movements. Similarly, 𝜅can acquire a
large range of values. More usefully, the plate’s inertia 𝜚< 10−3 for all physical values of
T and hence may be safely neglected if required. Similarly, the reduced Reynolds number,
𝜖2Re ≈10−3 and fluid inertia may be neglected. Given the uncertainty in the modulus of the
cupula itself, we note only that the inverse bendability, 𝑏= 𝐵/(𝑇𝑎2), is expected to be large.
The size of the dimensionless groups discussed above will inform our choices when
neglecting terms in the governing equations (2.11)-(2.12). In particular, we will exploit the
smallness of 𝜖to neglect terms of order 𝜖2Re, and the smallness of 𝜚to neglect inertial terms
in the plate equation (2.13). The last simplification is particularly useful as it will allow us
to simplify spatio-temporal PDEs into two sets of ODEs.
We now turn to consider in more detail the behaviour of the model for the typical parameter
values already discussed. Given the broad range of values that may be taken by the Stokes
number, we begin by considering slow movement (i.e. large T) in§ 3, and thus neglect terms
of size St. This will allow us to derive a reduced order equation (an ODE) for the deflection
of the cupula that can be compared to numerical results in §4. However, in §5 we consider
fast movements with finite Stokes numbers, leading to an integro-differential equation for the
deflection of the cupula. Both the relative stiffness 𝜅and the inverse bendability 𝑏are treated
as independent parameters. In particular, recalling that 𝜅is a key parameter, capturing the
relative timescales of the imposed motion and the cupular relaxation, a main objective of our
analysis will be to investigate how variations in 𝜅give rise to different solution regimes.
3. Asymptotic solution for negligible Stokes number
Motivated by the small value of the Stokes number St = 𝑎2/(𝜈T) ∼10−2 for natural
movement timescales, T ∼1 sec, in this section we assume the Stokes number is negligibly
small and solve the coupled system (2.12) asymptotically, expanding the solution in powers
of the small aspect ratio 𝜖. To this end we introduce the following formal expansions
𝑢(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) = 𝑢0(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) + 𝜖𝑢1(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) + 𝜖2𝑢2(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) + · · ·
𝑣(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) = 𝑣0(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) + 𝜖𝑣1(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) + 𝜖2𝑣2(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) + · · ·
𝑤(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) = 𝑤0(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) + 𝜖𝑤1(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) + 𝜖2𝑤2(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) + · · ·
𝑝(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) = 𝑝0(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) + 𝜖𝑝1(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) + 𝜖2𝑝2(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑠, 𝑡) + · · ·
𝜂(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑡) = 𝜂0(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑡) + 𝜖𝜂1(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑡) + 𝜖2𝜂2(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑡) + · · ·
