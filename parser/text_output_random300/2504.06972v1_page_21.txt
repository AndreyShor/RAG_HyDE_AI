Fig. 4 | Temperature and perpendicular magnetic field dependence of the 
superconducting state. a, B-dependent ρxx in the superconducting state at T = 75 mK, 225 mK, 
450 mK, 675 mK, 900 mK, and 1.3 K. b-g, B-dependent ρxy in the superconducting state, 
measured at the same temperature points as in a. In a-g, Solid (dashed) lines represent scans of 
B from negative (positive) values to positive (negative) values. h, Map of ρxx as a function of T 
and B, with the superconducting critical magnetic field Bc marked by the dashed line. i, Linecuts 
of e at representative B. Tonset is marked by the arrow. j, ρxy as a function of T at B = 0 T, 0.1 T 
and 0.9 T. Dashed lines in h and j represent zero resistance. All data in this figure are measured 
at νh = 0.74 and D = 0.
