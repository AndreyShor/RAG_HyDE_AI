models, the overall opacity is higher, particularly at the BCZ. This highlights the fact that the
opacity reconstruction is directly linked to the chemical composition of the model and that each
unique recalibration may change a bit the scale but not eliminate the fact that a correction is re-
quired. This is in line with previous works25 that used the opacity of a GN93 model to “correct”
an AGSS09 model in terms of relative sound speed differences. In that sense, further revision
of the opacities will play a key role regarding the solar abundance scale.
Another crucial aspect of the reconstruction procedure is the assumption of a ﬁxed equation of
state for solar plasma. It comes into play when determining the temperature proﬁle, T, from
the given ρ, P, X, Z. The values of ρ and P are obtained from the reconstruction procedure of
Buldgen et al. (2020)51, while X and Z are extracted from the evolutionary model. To assess the
