From this velocity profile of the gas, there does not appear to be any notable interactions or 
reduction of flow from the splitter plate (located along the 0 cm Y-position in Figure 4). While 
the velocity profile will change as a regolith surface and crater are introduced into the flow, 
these initial measurements can also be used to calculate the Reynolds number (Re) associated 
with the setup using eq. 4 below, where Dp is the pipe diameter, V is the flow velocity, and μ is 
the dynamic viscosity (Sommerfeld, 1908).

Assuming a 1.0 cm diameter pipe, as well as a density of 0.001225 g/cm³ and dynamic viscosity 
of roughly 0.000018 Pa·s for room temperature air, it is clear from velocity measurements that 
the non-dimensional Reynolds number for this flow is roughly Re ≈ 37,417; consistent with 
turbulent flow (Re > 2,900). Similar measurements were taken for upstream chamber pressures 
of 275 – 551 kPa, with Reynolds numbers above 2,900 as well, also indicating a potential for 
turbulent flow in all examined test regions. 
 
3.2 Crater Formation and Shapes 
 
Analysis of plume videos reveals that only surface scouring and saltation was observed 
during crater formation, consistent with viscous erosion as the sole erosion process in this 
study. These observations match previous measurements of viscous erosion by Metzger et al. 
(2010), which used the same experimental setup and flow rates. Given that pitot-static 
measurements confirm subsonic gas flows (Section 3.1), it is unlikely that bearing capacity 
failure is present during trials, especially as surface normal forces and velocities are small. 
Additionally, no other particle transport phenomenon were observed during plume 
measurements, such as tangential granular flows were observed which would otherwise 
suggest bearing capacity or diffusion driven flow. Since crater depth and volume measurements 
are taken throughout plume impingement, diffused gas eruption was not observed in this study 
as well, especially since this erosion mechanism only occurs after removal of high-velocity 
impinged flow (Metzger et al., 2010). Taken together, these observations suggest that viscous 
erosion is the only plausible mechanism for all examined measurements.  
As shown in Figure 3b, crater depth and volume time traces had similar steady-state 
slopes, but depth always reached steady-state first for each sample examined. In addition to 
measuring the depth and volume changes for each run, differences in overall crater shapes 
were noted for impingements with regolith simulant and the 40-80 µm glass beads. As shown in 
Figure 5a below, a compound crater shape with two different radii was produced using a mass 
flow rate of 215 slpm impinged on 40-80 µm glass beads, similar to results previously reported 
by Metzger (2024a) for other glass bead sizes. However, using the same setup and mass flow 
rate, flow impinged on uncompacted LMS-1 produced a more-simple crater shape with steep 
walls (Figure 5b). The singular crater shape shown in Figure 5b was also observed with 
compacted LMS-1, and for runs with LHS-1 and LHS-1D at all levels of compaction. The 
compound crater shape in Figure 5a was only observed with glass bead trials and the potential 
mechanism behind these shape differences is discussed in Section 4.2.
