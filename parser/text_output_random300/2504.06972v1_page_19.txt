Fig. 2 | IQAH effect, FQAH effect and RIQAH effect in 3.83° tMoTe2. a,b, Symmetrized 
ρxx (a) and anti-symmetrized ρxy (b) under B = ±0.1 T, as a function of D and νh. FQAH and 
RIQAH states are indicated by green dashed lines in a. The black dashed circle depicts the 
superconducting region with both vanishing ρxx and vanishing ρxy. c-h, B-dependent ρxx and ρxy 
at the νh, D points highlighted by green markers shown in a and b. Solid (dashed) lines represent 
scans of B from negative (positive) values to positive (negative) values. ρxx in c-h has been 
symmetrized with respect to B, while ρxy is shown after subtracting an offset from the raw data, 
without being anti-symmetrized. i,j, Raw data of ρxx (i) and ρxy (j) as a function of B and νh at 
D = 0. Dashed lines in i,j represent the expected dispersions based on Streda formula for the 
FQAH states at νh = 2/3, 3/5, 4/7, and 5/9 with |C| = 2/3, 3/5, 4/7, and 5/9, respectively. k, 
Symmetrized ρxx and anti-symmetrized ρxy under B = ±0.1 T, as a function of νh at D = 0. 
Quantized or nearly quantized plateaus of ρxy, and local minima of ρxx can be clearly seen for 
the IQAH, FQAH, and RIQAH states. Grey dashed lines represent zero resistance, and the 
expected quantized values for the IQAH, FQAH, and RIQAH states. The measurement 
temperature for a-k is TMC = 15 mK.
