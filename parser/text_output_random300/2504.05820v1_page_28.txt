This formula is well justified only if the scale at which the short and long distance interaction
occurs are well separated. If this is no longer the case, then multiple parton interaction (higher-
twist) can occur and spoil the factorization. Higher-twist are then process dependent and
Eq. (1.54) ensures that they are suppressed by powers of Q2. Partonic cross-sections can be
computed using pQCD, for every given partonic process, while PDFs are universal and their
numerical value have to be extracted by fitting to experimental data. Similarly to the case of
renormalization, in Eq. (1.54) we have introduced an additional scale µF , called factorization
scale, which is not physical and plays as similar role as the renormalization scale.
NLO corrections to q + γ →q.
To explain the physical origin of this factorization scale let us
look again at the simple process q + γ →q. Here ˆσi can be identified with a partonic structure
function ˆF2,i.

with P(x) a characteristic function describing the quark to gluon splitting. This leads to a
logarithmic divergence for QT →0, i.e. when the emitted gluon is collinear to the quark,
and has vanishing transverse momentum. Again one can identify such limit as low-energy
interaction and thus reabsorb the divergence into the PDF definition, leaving the partonic
structure function ˆF2,i finite. To do so, we introduce a cut-off scale µF which acts as regulator
of the divergent logarithmic term separating ln Q2

T . The first contribution is
finite and can be kept inside the partonic structure function, while the second can be arbitrary
large and must be retained inside the PDFs. Note that to get the full NLO divergent contribution
to q + γ →q, one would need to account also for the virtual corrections to the quark leg and
photon vertex. Before subtraction, the full quark initiated contribution to F2 up to NLO then is
