The intuition is that, under the constraint of total momentum conservation between pseudoion and electron,
the matrix element connecting electron states p1 →p2 has “radial” dependence on momenta through the
overlap of their respective g-functions (G-functions in the diagonalized version in Eq. (108)) and “angular”
dependence through the Legendre polynomials Pl, i.e.
ˆkp1 · ˆkp2 is the cosine of the angle between the
momenta of the two states. Our block-encoding procedure in Sec. 5.1.5 exploits this structure.

Detailed physical justification for initial states
We utilize well-known results in physics to further justify our choice of initial state.
Solids
Many metals are qualitatively described by Fermi liquid theory (Ch. 15 of [94]), which, in short, states that
electrons in solids can be treated as effective non-interacting fermionic quasiparticles. For metals, typical
Fermi temperatures TF are between 104 −105K (Table 2.1 of [95]). With common operating temperatures
of many chemical reactions on the order of a few hundred K, we are often in the regime T ≪TF. Employing
the Sommerfeld expansion (Ch. 7 of [96]) for a metal with N ions, the electronic energy and heat capacity
at constant volume becomes,

32The original Ref. [60] (and subsequent work in Ref. [29]) shows a factor (−1)l. We believe this is erroneous since the factor
il in Eq. (151) cancels in Eq. (150) due to conjugation since both bra and ket present.
