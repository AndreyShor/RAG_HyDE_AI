The case of two right-handed neutrinos
The heavy Majorana neutrinos can produce the baryon asymmetry in the universe through the
leptogenesis [11]. However, two heavy Majorana neutrinos is enough to explain the observed
bayon asymmetry in the present universe [12]. In this section we introduce two right-handed
neutrinos Ni (i = 1, 2) or (i = 2, 3). In practice we take one of three right-handed neutrinos
superheavy by taking its mass infinity. We consider two cases, that is, M1 = ∞and M3 = ∞
in the previous section 9. Then, all elements of the first and third column of the Dirac mass
matrices of Eqs. (10), (11) and (12) vanish for the case of M1 = ∞and M3 = ∞, respectively.
Since the number of parameters are reduced due to M1 = ∞and M3 = ∞, the CP violating
phases δCP are predicted in more narrow regions.
In Fig. 5, we show the prediction of δCP and mββ for the case of M1 = ∞. We, furthermore,
impose the positive cosmological baryon asymmetry, YB > 0 for the case of M1 < M2. In Fig. 6,
we show its prediction of δCP and mββ. It is interesting that the CP violating phase δCP is
predicted in narrow regions, one of which is consistent with the experimental data. We should
comment here that the almost same results are obtained in the other two cases, A2, A3.
