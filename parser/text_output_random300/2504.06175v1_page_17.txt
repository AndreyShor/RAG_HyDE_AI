Appendix G: Circuits for noise and distillation
Here we present the circuits used in the distillation protocols of the main text, as well as the modifications to those
circuits that enabled us to study them under various types of noise.

(b) Z2B recurrence protocol with idling noise
FIG. 13. Circuit(s) for the Z2B recurrence protocol with idling noise. In both circuits, two Bell pairs are created prior to time
label t0, between t0 and t1 the first and second qubits are swapped and a delay is added from t1 to t2. The delay inteval t2 −t1
is parametrized as nδt where δt is variable and fixed integer n is the number of times the ZZ sequence Wδt,k is applied. Control
phase angles in each sequence are θjk = fk2πωjδt/n where 1 ≤k ≤n, 0 ≤j ≤2, fk = 1 if k < n/2 and −1 otherwise, ωj is the
ZZ frequence between qubits j and j + 1. In Fig. 13a after time t2 Pauli basis measurements are carried out on each qubit to
determine the Bell fidelity (see App. B for details). In Fig. 13b after t2, ZZ measurements are carried out on qubits 1 and 3
while qubits 0 and 2 are measured in the Pauli basis for Bell fidelity estimation.
