Regarding the relaxation of energy within the conden-
sate, there have been attempts, following the original ap-
proach of Pitaevskii [13], to include it in the phenomeno-
logical model by making the Hamiltonian non-Hermitian
as ˆH →(1 −Λ) ˆH, where Λ is a small dimensionless
parameter that controls the strength of dissipation [14].
However, it can be easily seen that this energy-dependent
damping does not conserve the total number of particles
in the condensate and therefore cannot be viewed as pure
energy relaxation.
The present paper represents an attempt to construct
the theory of pure energy relaxation in a polariton sys-
tem. We base our consideration on the quantum hydro-
dynamics approach, describing the system dynamics via
set of classical field Hamilton equations for canonically
conjugated variables of concentration and phase two and
introducing relaxation in a natural way by adding the
gradient term. We analyze how this term affects the dy-
namics of the polariton droplets and dispersion of the
elementary excitations. We consider the scalar case, fo-
cusing on pure energy relaxation only, leaving the spinor
case and a description of polarization and spin relaxation
for follow-up work.
Our goal here is not to present a modeling of system
dynamics in any particular experimental configuration,
but rather to focus on the fundamental role of the damp-
ing mechanisms, which were overlooked before. There-
fore, for the reason of clarity of the presentation, in our
analysis we neglect all other dissipative processes, such as
finite lifetimes, external pumping, and coupling with an
incoherent excitonic reservoir, for which well established
theoretical approaches exist already. These terms can be
easily taken into account when analyzing a particular set
of experimental data.
Dynamic equations. Let us note that the conservative
Gross-Pitraevskii equation 1 is nothing but an equation
for a classical field, which can be obtained using the least

Using the Madelung representation of a field function in

one gets:

From this expression it follows that the angle θ can
be considered as a generalized field coordinate, while the
density ρ corresponds to canonically conjugated momen-
tum as:

This system, of course, is fully equivalent to Eq.1 (with
U = 0) and can be obtained from it directly using the
substitution 4. However, it has a very important advan-
tage as pure energy relaxation can be directly introduced
to it, as it is discussed below.
Let us first note that Eq. 8 is nothing but a continu-
ity equation for the conserving quantity ρ with current

Pure energy relaxation should not affect particle number
conservation, so we can do nothing but leave this equa-
tion as is.
On the other hand, energy relaxation can be intro-
duced in Eq.

−δH /δθ, which drags the system towards the state of
the minimal energy, so that the modified dynamic equa-
tions read:
