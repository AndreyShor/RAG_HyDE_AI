Supplementary Figure 2: Reconstructed Ledoux discriminant proﬁles from various initial ref-
erence models, varying the reference opacities, chemical abundances and efﬁciency of macro-
scopic mixing (See Table 1 for details of the included physics). The curves are hardly distin-
guishable, showing the model-independency of the ﬁnal reconstructed proﬁle.
