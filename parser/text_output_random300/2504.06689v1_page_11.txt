with improvements using a four-dimensional formulation [170]. Applied to top-quark pro-
cesses [171–176], to pp →H + j [177, 178], inclusive jet production [179], pp →3γ [180],
pp →2γ + j [181], pp →γ + 2j [182], pp →W + j [183], and pp →3j [184], the latter
being the most complicated process from the point of view of infrared divergences that has
been computed to date. Extensions to deal with flavoured jets [185, 186] and B-hadron
production [187–189].
– qT -subtraction [190]:
A slicing approach for processes with a colourless final state and/or a pair of massive
coloured particles. Applied to H [190,191], V [192,193] and V V ′ production processes [194–
204], which are available in the MATRIX program [205]. Predictions at NNLOQCD for H,
V , V H, V γ, γγ, and V V ′ available in the MCFM program [206]. Further applications at
NNLOQCD include V H [207–209], HH [210,211], V HH [212,213]. Extended to cope with
a pair of massive coloured particles [214,215] and applied to top-pair production [216,217]
and b¯b production [218]; more recently extended to processes beyond the Born back-to-back
configuration and applied to t¯tH [219,220] and t¯tW [221]. The same developments allowed
the mixed QCD–EW corrections to Drell–Yan with massive leptons to be tackled [222–224].
Method extended to N3LOQCD [225–228] with applications to Higgs production [229,230]
and Drell–Yan production [231–236].
Adding sub-leading power corrections, computed to a given logarithmic accuracy, can im-
prove the numerical accuracy of qT subtraction. These have been studied in Refs. [237,238].
At NLO accuracy, a method to compute all-order power corrections was recently presented,
and used to compute next-to-next-to-leading power corrections to Higgs production [239].
Lastly, special types of linear power corrections arise from fiducial cuts [238, 240, 241],
which can be eliminated from the qT slicing calculation through a simple recoil prescrip-
tion [242,243] or alternatively through the adjustment of cuts [244].
– N-jettiness [245–247]:
A slicing approach based on the resolution variable τN (N-jettiness) that is suited for
processes beyond the scope of the qT method, i.e. involving final-state jets. Explicitly
worked out at NNLOQCD for hadron-collider processes with up to one jet. Applied to
V (+j) [246, 248–255] and H + j [256]. Colourless final state production available in the
MCFM program [257,258]. Same technique also used in the calculation of top decay [259]
and t-channel single top production [260]. Important progress towards the extension for
N3LOQCD calculations have been made [261–273] with all ingredients now known for zero-
jettiness slicing at N3LO.
Including sub-leading power corrections, computed to a given logarithmic accuracy, can
improve the numerical performance of the N-jettiness method. The LL corrections are
known for color singlet production to N3LO, computed in Soft–Collinear Effective The-
ory (SCET) [274] and to NLL accuracy for color singlet production to NLO, both using
SCET [275] and direct QCD [276]. The LL corrections to V + j productions at NLO were
computed in Ref. [277]. The impact of fiducial and isolation cuts on power corrections in
both the N-jettiness and qT subtractions was analyzed in Ref. [238]. Recently, a proce-
dure to improve both the N-jettiness slicing method using projection-to-Born correction
factors was proposed, and exhibits an improved numerical behavior for Higgs, Drell–Yan
and diphoton production [274,278].
– ColorFul subtraction [279]:
Fully local subtraction extending the ideas of the Catani–Seymour dipole method at
NLO [280].
Analytically integrated counter-terms for the infrared poles, numerical in-
tegration for finite parts. Fully worked out for processes with hadronic final states and
