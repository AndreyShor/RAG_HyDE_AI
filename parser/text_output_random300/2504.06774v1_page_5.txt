[27, 1]. Abadía-Heredia et al. [1] introduced a hybrid ROM that integrates POD with
CNN and LSTM networks to predict fluid flow in complex scenarios. Their model signific-
antly reduced computational time from tens of hours to a few minutes while maintaining
accuracy and demonstrated the potential of combining POD with deep learning architec-
tures to obtain efficient and accurate fluid dynamics predictions. This hybrid approach
leverages the strengths of both methodologies to model complex, non-linear interactions
within the flow field. In addition, Abadía-Heredia et al. [28] presented hybrid ROMs that
integrate SVD with neural networks and compared these with purely deep learning-based
predictive ROMs, which use autoencoders (AEs) for dimensionality reduction. The study
demonstrated that hybrid ROMs are more robust and require fewer snapshots for training
while maintaining accuracy across different cases, including turbulent flows. Furthermore,
hybrid ROMs offer greater generalizability by allowing neural network architectures to re-
main consistent as they reduce the data to a few dominant POD modes. Le Clainche
et al. [27] demonstrated that the combination of machine learning with DMD effectively
captures the main flow instabilities and energy-producing mechanisms in turbulent flows,
resulting in accurate long-term predictions of wall-shear stress. San and Maulik [29] ap-
plied artificial neural networks (ANN) in conjunction with POD for real-time prediction of
flow fields, showcasing the potential of hybrid ROMs in fluid dynamics. In another study,
Xu et al. [30] proposed a hybrid model that integrates POD with advanced deep learning
models, including LSTM and CNN networks, for fluid flow prediction. The model used
POD to extract dominant spatial modes from high-dimensional flow data, significantly
reducing computational complexity. The reduced temporal coefficients were then fed into
the LSTM and CNN models for sequential forecasting. All of these studies clearly high-
light the advantages of integrating modal decomposition techniques with DL models for
forecasting in the domain of fluid mechanics.
In this work, we present a novel hybrid ROM model that integrates High-Order Singu-
lar Value Decomposition (HOSVD) [31] with different LSTM architectures to predict flow
field solutions. HOSVD significantly improves the traditional SVD by extending its cap-
abilities to multi-way data arrays (tensors). The main advantage of using SVD/HOSVD
is that data is reorganized into matrices, allowing it to work with a reduced quantity of
data. This provides a comprehensive framework for dimensionality reduction that can
capture the flow physics and patterns within the data. This work builds on the found-
ational work of Abadía-Heredia et al.
[1], which integrated POD with deep learning
models. The methodology involves applying HOSVD to the temporal data to extract the
dominant modes, which are then used as input to neural networks for temporal evolution
prediction. This approach enhances the dimensionality reduction process, leading to more
accurate and efficient temporal predictions. Another objective is to explore the design
of LSTM-based deep learning architecture. By constructing and testing various LSTM
architectures with different levels of complexity, the objective is to understand the rela-
tionship between architectural depth and the predictive performance required for various
