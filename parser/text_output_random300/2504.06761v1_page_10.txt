reproduces the expected scaling behavior. However, it fails to capture the peak due to
the limitations of the damping function used, which highlights opportunities for future
improvements.

comparing DNS data with SWAT both with and without vortex packet arrangement (see
figure 5(a)). The structured arrangement of vortex packets successfully reconstructs the
streaky patterns characteristic of streamwise velocity fields in wall turbulence, closely
matching the DNS results. These streaks, consisting of alternating low- and high-speed
regions, are fundamental coherent structures that play a crucial role in momentum transport
and turbulence dynamics. In contrast, a random vortex arrangement produces irregular,
patchy velocity structures that fail to capture these essential features. This comparison
underscores the importance of incorporating organized vortex packets to accurately replicate
the underlying physics of wall turbulence.
The fidelity of the SWAT model is further validated through spectral analysis. As shown in
