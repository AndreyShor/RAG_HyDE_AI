standard samples form a calibration curve and unknown analytes are predicted. Traditional 
methods rely on one-dimensional fitting at a visually selected wavelength, but our results show 
that even the best single predictor is identified through machine learning rather than visual 
inspection. Full-spectrum modeling with principal component analysis (PCA) and linear 
regression consistently improves accuracy, with up to a 6000-fold mean squared error (MSE) 
reduction in Ti-based structures due to their smooth, intensity-driven spectra. These findings 
underscore the critical role of spectral shape and highlight the advantage of full-spectrum 
approaches, particularly for meta-gratings governed by broadband intensity modulation. 
 
2. Proposed Structure 
Figure 1 illustrates the meta-grating structure used as the bulk index sensing platform in this 
study. The geometry consists of a one-dimensional periodic array of triangular cross-sectioned 
nanorods positioned on an optically thick gold (Au) reflector. The simulations have revealed that 
other metals can be used as the back reflector as well, given that they are optically thick to block 
the transmission. Each nanorod has a base (period) and height of 3 ÔÅ≠m, forming an isosceles 
triangular cross-section. The material of the nanorods is set to either Ti or Si, allowing for the 
exploration of different resonance behaviors. Ti supports broadband intensity-modulated spectra, 
while Si enables narrowband Mie-type resonances with distinct peak shifts. This design serves as 
a unified geometry for comparing different spectral modalities within the same structural platform.
