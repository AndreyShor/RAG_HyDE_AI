where the first term comes from the SWAPs and the rest from the indexing. Given that we must swap up
pairs of electrons and ions, the total cost is
2nηval + 2¯nηion + 2(ηval −1) + 2(ηion −1),
(170)
We consider an uncompute with the same cost. The additional cost of controlling SELECTs to indicate
which term in the block encoding to apply is included in the costs in the sections below.

The cost of preparing the reference state from Eq. (167) is 2⌈log(η)⌉+ 2bT −8, for some user-specified
precision bT . The cost of the inequality test is dictated by the precision with which one requires to prepare
the target state. It is shown in [75], Lemma 2.11 that preparing a sampling state that is uniform with
MT ≥
2
ϵT amplitudes suffices to prepare a target to within precision ϵT (we also assume that MT is chosen
to be a power of two to simplify preparation costs). The inequality test then requires ⌈log 2
ϵT ⌉Toffolis and
an equal number of ancillae. The output of the inequality test must be amplified; the success probability is

and so we can guarantee one round of amplification provided at least half the particles are electrons. This
requires three calls to both the inequality test and the USP. We must also add a single control for term
selection. This can be achieved by (i) controlling the inequality test (doubling its cost); and (ii) adding a
controlled USP to uncompute the reference state (with cost 7⌈log(η)⌉+ 2bT −6). The total cost is therefore
6⌈log 2
ϵT ⌉+ 13⌈log(η)⌉+ 8bT −30.
E.2.2
Preparing the reference state for |kp|2
We consider the same approach given as in Ref. [29]; i.e. to prepare a uniform reference state (discussed in
Sec. VII C therein). The cost of USP is given in Eq. (167), with d = maxp |kp|2 for electrons (or equivalently
d = maxP |kP|2 for ions). The reference state for ions should be encoded over a larger number of amplitudes
than for electrons. To achieve this, we check whether ¯I ≤ηval by applying an inequality test to the particle
index register (the output of this inequality test flags whether we are encoding an electron or an ion). The
inequality test has cost ⌈log(η)⌉, and can be uncomputed using only Cliffords. We then apply two different
USPs controlled on this flag. Assuming that the register encoding |kp|2 is of size b, and that of |kP|2 is of
size ¯b, the cost for each controlled USP is 7b + 2bk −6 and 7¯b + 2bk −6, respectively. The total cost is then
⌈log(η)⌉+ 7b + 7¯b + 4bk −12, for some precision bk.
