Abstract
CP invariance is a very attractive solution to the strong CP problem in QCD.
This solution requires the vanishing arg [det Md detMu], where the Md and Mu are
the mass matrices for the down- and up-type quarks. It happens if we have several
zeros in the quark mass matrices. We proceed a systematic construction, in this
paper, of two zeros textures for the down-type quark mass matrix while the mass
matrix for the up-type quarks is always diagonal. We find only three types of the
mass matrices can explain the observed CKM matrix, the masses of the quarks and
the charged leptons and the small enough vacuum angle θ < 10−10. We extend
the mass construction to the neutrino sector and derive predictions on the CP
violating parameter δCP in the neutrino oscillation and the mass parameter mββ.
It is extremely remarkable that the normal (NH) and inverted (IH) hierarchies in the
neutrino masses are equally possible in the case where we introduce only two right-
handed neutrinos Ns. Furthermore, we have a strict prediction on the δCP ≃200◦
or 250◦in the NH case. If it is the case we can naturally explain the positive sign
of the baryon asymmetry in the present universe.
