This framework effectively combines dimensionality reduction with temporal evolu-
tion, enabling efficient and accurate reconstruction and prediction of flow dynamics at
reduced computational cost. By truncating the smaller singular values, SVD enables di-
mensionality reduction and noise suppression, making it a powerful tool for applications
such as data cleaning, image compression, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
[34, 35].
HOSVD extends these principles of SVD to multidimensional arrays. HOSVD pre-
serves the inherent multifaceted nature of data, making it particularly suitable for applic-
ations where spatial, temporal, and other complex dependencies need to be maintained
[36, 37, 24]. This approach allows for a more accurate and efficient representation of
high-dimensional data, capturing the significant features along each mode [38, 39]. As
a result, HOSVD is particularly advantageous for applications in fields such as fluid dy-
namics, image processing, and data compression, where preserving the multidimensional
relationships within the data is crucial for accurate analysis and prediction.
HOSVD decomposes databases organized in tensor form, where SVD is applied to each
one of the fibers of the tensor. For instance, the HOSVD of the fourth-order tensor X is
presented as:
Xj1j2j3k ≃
P1
X
p1=1
P2
X
p2=1
P3
X
p3=1
N
X
n=1
Sp1p2p3nU (1)
j1p1U (2)
j2p2U (3)
j3p3T kn,
(6)
where Sp1p2p3n is the core tensor, another fourth-order tensor, and the columns of the
matrices U (1), U (2), U (3), and T are known as the modes of the decomposition.
The first set of modes (i.e., the columns of the matrices U (l) for l = 1, 2, 3) correspond
to the number of components of the database and the spatial variables, so they are known
as the spatial HOSVD modes, while the columns of the matrix T correspond to the time
variable and are referred to as the temporal HOSVD modes.
The decomposition involves singular values corresponding to each mode, signifying
the importance of each mode. Similarly to SVD, dimensionality reduction is achieved by
retaining significant modes based on a tolerance ε applied to each set [33]:
σ(1)
P1+1
σ(1)
1
≤ε1,
σ(2)
P2+1
σ(2)
1
≤ε2,
σ(3)
P3+1
σ(3)

≤ε3,
σt
N+1

≤ε4.

After dimensionality reduction, the tensor is approximated as [33]:
X ≃
N
X
n=1
W j1j2j3n ˆT kn,
(8)
Where:
• W j1j2j3n are the spatial modes.
• ˆT kn = σt
n T kn are the temporal modes.
