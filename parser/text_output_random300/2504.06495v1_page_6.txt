Example continued:
Returning to the above example, assume all n = 1000 binary mea-
surements occur simultaneously. The state vector then decomposes as ψ = P
y∈{0,1}n ψy,
creating 2n decoherent branches corresponding to components ψy.
These states diﬀer in
their squared amplitudes φy := ⟨ψy|ψy⟩. The continuation of each state naturally continues
to branch into many universes, that is, the total number of possible multiverse branches
descending from the original state ψ is much larger than 2n after macroscopic timescales
In our framework, within this larger set of multiverse branches, virtually all have y within
[100, 300] — the fraction outside this interval is only 2.2 · 10−14. This outcome arises due to
“small-signal truncation,” which ensures that the number of descendant branches originating
from each state ψy is proportional to φy over macroscopic timescales. Consequently, instead
of postulating measurement probabilities proportional to φy as in the Born rule, we ﬁnd that
the relative number of future multiverse branches naturally emerges in the correct proportion
as a result of intrinsic branching dynamics and small signal truncation.

This example illustrates the core idea of our approach. We do not postulate a probability
rule for measurement outcomes. Instead, we show that the number of future universe branches
arising from each outcome is proportional to the squared amplitude of that outcome’s state.
As a result, the relative frequency of branches matches the probabilities given by the Born
rule. There is no need to assign probabilities or invoke randomness. Since almost all future
branches lie within the expected outcome range (y ∈[100, 300]), it is natural that we ﬁnd
ourselves in one of them. The goal of this paper is to show that the Born rule in that sense
— understood as the relative count of future universe branches — emerges naturally from
branching dynamics combined with small-signal truncation.
Explanations for quantum randomness and the Born rule have been extensively explored
in the literature. Hidden variables theories, most notably Bohmian mechanics (Bohm 1952),
propose that quantum indeterminism arises from our ignorance of underlying determin-
istic variables, with particles following well-deﬁned trajectories guided by the wave func-
tion. Other approaches include Everett’s original symmetry arguments (Everett 1957), the
Deutsch-Wallace decision-theoretic approach deriving the Born rule from rationality prin-
ciples (Deutsch 1999, Wallace 2012), and Zurek’s environment-assisted invariance (envari-
