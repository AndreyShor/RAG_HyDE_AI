The second case in (A.13) is the bound identified in [34], while the upper line is a more recent
discovery proven for simply connected 1-parameter CY3 in [82]. There is an additional assumption
in [82], that what they called the BMT inequality holds. Y is not simply connected, but we assume
that the upper line in (A.13) holds and use it as boundary data. If we do not make this assumption
and only use the bottom line of (A.13), then we are unable to reach even genus 2. We will return
to discussing this assumption at the end of this appendix.
At any fixed genus g, (A.13) predicts that some number of the first few n(g)
β
vanish. For our model,
at genera 2,3,4 there are respectively 2,4,6 such vanishing n(g)
β . Note that this equals 2g −2 for
each case, and so we can fully constrain the holomorphic ambiguity. Below we provide expansions
for the F(g)(φ) that we so obtain.

(A.14)
Note that, by construction, the constant terms in these expansions match with (A.11). By applying
the mirror map (3.13) and comparing with the GV formula (3.24), we obtain the invariants up to
genus 4 listed in Table 2, Appendix §B. The tables in Appendix §B go beyond genus 4, using
considerations we will go on to explain in this current appendix.
Expanding about the three conifold points
The behaviour of F(g) at a conifold point φc is governed by the gap condition derived in [34]. The
mirror coordinate at a conifold point is given by
tc = kc
ϖ(c)
1
ϖ(c)
0
.
(A.15)
Here ϖ(c)
0
is a solution to the PF equation, with a series expansion centred on the conifold point
beginning ϖ(c)
0 (φ −φc) = 1 + O((φ −φc)2). Similarly, ϖ(c)
1
= (φ −φc) + O((φ −φc)2). Here kc is
a normalisation constant, such that [34]
F (g≥2)
conifold(tc) = |Gc|(−1)g−1B2g
2g(2g −2)t2g−2
c
+ O(1).
(A.16)
The condition (A.16) constrains f(g) by prescribing the behaviour at φ = φc. To obtain the numbers
kc at each conifold point, we utilise the observation19 in [60, §8.7]. This provides
k1/27 = 81,
k±i/(3

2(−1 ± i

3).
(A.17)
In practice, we go back and recompute all propagators in expansions about each conifold point
in the variable eφ = φ −φc. In doing so, when we take the holomorphic limit we replace Keφ 7→

discusses this normalisation.
