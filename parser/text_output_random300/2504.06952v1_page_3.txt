where Nf denotes the number of flavors and TD7 is the
tension of the D7-brane, which is expressed in terms of
fundamental string parameters. The scalar field ϕ cor-
responds to the dilaton, while gµν is the induced metric
on the worldvolume of the D7-brane. The parameter α′
is the inverse of the string tension. The field strength
F is associated with a U(1) gauge field Aµ, whose only
non-vanishing component is the temporal one, At(¯ρ).

2πα′ is actually a constant, it can be absorbed into the
gauge field.
The variations of the Lagrangian density with re-
spect to z and Aµ are zero. Consequently, two conserved
quantities, c and d, can be derived, given by

The two conserved quantities can be identified using the
holographic dictionary, which states that under asymp-
totic conditions, c and d correspond to the constituent
quark mass m and the chemical potential µ, respec-
tively. It is important to note that this present quark
holographic model adopts a flavor-independent approach.
The constituent quark mass m is the only free parame-
ter in this model and will be used to construct different
scenarios of HS.
The action (2) contains divergences. To address these,
one can perform a regularization procedure at zero tem-
perature by subtracting a specific term to obtain the
regularized on-shell action [42,58]. This process allows
for the final determination of the free energy density,
which is composed of two distinct parts:
Ω= ΩN=4 + Ωflavor .
(6)
The first part, ΩN=4, corresponds to the color contri-
bution and can be neglected in the zero-temperature
limit [59]. The second part, Ωflavor, represents the fla-
vor contributions, which can be expressed as [34]:
Ωflavor = −3
4π2 (µ2
q −m2)2 ,
(7)
where the color and flavor numbers were set to three.
The free energy can be identified with the pressure
pq, thermodynamically expressed as Ωflavor = −pq. By
applying a Legendre transform, the energy density can
be expressed as ε = µq
∂p
∂µq −pq, where µq is the chem-
ical potential associated with the quark. The equation

3 Relativistic mean-field model
In this work, the hadronic phase of the HS is described
by a phenomenological finite-range relativistic mean-
field model constructed by means of the Quantum Field
Theory (hadrons as degrees of freedom). Specifically,
such a model describes the nucleon-nucleon interaction
in terms of the meson-exchange mechanism. A typical
Lagrangian density used as the starting point for de-
scribing the hadronic system is given by [43–45]

The nucleon and meson fields are represented by ψ,
σ, ωµ, and ⃗bµ, with their corresponding masses de-
noted as M nuc, mσ, mω, and mρ. The field strength
tensors associated with the vector mesons are defined as
Fµν = ∂µων −∂νωµ and ⃗Bµν = ∂µ⃗bν −∂ν⃗bµ. The model
includes several free parameters, specifically the cou-
pling constants gσ, gω, gρ, as well as the self-interaction
coefficients A and B. In this work, we adopt the pa-
rameter set from the NL3* model [46], selected due
to its ability to accurately reproduce fundamental nu-
clear properties such as ground-state binding energies,
charge radii, and giant monopole resonances. This pa-
rameterization has been validated against experimental
data from various spherical nuclei, including 16O, 34Si,
40Ca, 48Ca, 52Ca, 54Ca, 48Ni, 56Ni, 78Ni, 90Zr, 100Sn,
132Sn, and 208Pb. Additionally, it effectively describes
the macroscopic properties of neutron stars. A compre-
hensive analysis involving over 400 other RMF model
parameterizations is provided in Ref. [60].
