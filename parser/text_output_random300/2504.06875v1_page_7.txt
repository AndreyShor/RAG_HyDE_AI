same intensity ratios were then plotted as a function of 𝜃 and 𝐿𝑎𝑣 and fitted by eq. 2 to test the influence of averaging. 
The resulting values of 𝑑 and 𝑘 are given in Figure 4 and illustrated in Figure 5c,d. It should be mentioned that EAL 
values for 𝜃> 60° are increasingly error-prone and should not be applied on their own.[30] All unweighted intensity 
ratios are given in Table S3 in the SI. 
 
Figure 4. (a) Intensity ratios weighted by atomic number densities (𝐼𝑆𝑛2+ ∙𝑁𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒)/(𝐼𝑆𝑛0 ∙𝑁𝑆𝑛𝑂) as a function of the emission 
angle 𝜃, 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑂, and 𝐿𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒. The set of colored surface plots is a 3D-representation of the parameterized eq. 3. (b) The same 
intensity ratios as in (a) as a function of 𝜃 and 𝐿𝑎𝑣, according to eq. 2. The parameters 𝑑 and 𝑘 correspond to the average 
SnO film thickness and the sharpness of the interface, respectively. The data points from 3p and 3s at 𝜃= 75° are not 
shown to enhance the clarity of the diagrams. 
Figure 5a shows the depth profiles of Sn2+ and Sn0 obtained from eq. 3. The nominal oxide layer thickness is 2.10 nm, 
however, the gradual transition region spans more than twice as deep. To confirm the validity of these results, 
Figure 5b and c show the depth profiles obtained from a sequence of 80 iterations of AES and 90 s of Ar+ sputtering. 
The first 20 spectra that contain information about the native oxide layer are shown in Figure 5b. While there is a clear 
chemical shift of the Sn MNN peak region, the Te MNN peak changes only in intensity apart from the vanishing overlap 
with the O KL1L1 and KL1L2-3 peaks. The main O KL2-3L2-3 peak vanishes as the oxide layer is ablated. In the first spectrum 
at the surface, there is adventitious carbon with some carbon-bonded oxygen (C KLL not shown). Below the 
contamination, the results indicate a stoichiometric 1:1 SnO layer – in contrast to SnO2, which is a stable Sn oxide, too. 
This agrees with the XPS data, which shows an atomic ratio of Sn2+ ions in Sn 3d5/2 to O2- in O 1s of approximately 1:1. 
Since, in this case, the XPS models do not distinguish between different oxidation states and the signals are accurately 
fitted by a single Voigt function, a possible contribution of SnO2 is not considered here. In addition, the AES spectra 
show that there is indeed no Te in the surface of the oxide layer. The signal in the Te MNN peak region is fully explained 
by the less intense O KLL transitions, taking into account their known relative intensity ratios.  
Figure 5c visualizes these changes in the relative elemental composition as a function of sputtering duration according 
to the quantitative evaluation of the AES spectra. Mind that it is not possible to accurately determine the ablation rate 
in layers with varying composition, which is why the sputter time was not converted to a thickness. The apparent 
composition might also be influenced by preferential sputtering. Most importantly, each data point is averaged over 
its information depth, which is about 3 nm (i.e. 𝜆≈1 nm) for the Auger electrons in both SnO and SnTe. Possible 
differences between the sensitivity factors for the metal and oxide are also neglected. For quantification in AES the 
raw spectrum is differentiated and the peak-to-peak height – measured as the difference between the maximum and 
minimum around the Auger peak – is used as the intensity, which is then normalized with RSFs to obtain relative 
atomic concentrations. The AES oxygen depth profile nevertheless shows very good agreement with the XPS results 
presented in Figure 5a.  
Underneath the oxide layer, there is a region of reduced Sn concentration, from which the excess Sn in the oxide layer 
presumably originates. Again, preferential sputtering might contribute to this apparent discrepancy. The nominal 1:1
