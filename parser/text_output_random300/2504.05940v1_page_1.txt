Abstract
We propose a Lorentz covariant matrix model as a nonperturbative
formulation of the bosonic M2-brane in M-theory. Unlike previous ap-
proaches relying on the light-cone gauge or symmetry-based constructions,
our model retains full 11-dimensional Lorentz invariance by introducing
a novel gauge-ﬁxing condition that restricts the symmetry of volume-
preserving deformations (VPD) to a subclass, which we call restricted
VPD (RVPD). This restriction enables a consistent matrix regularization
of the Nambu bracket, bypassing the long-standing obstructions related
to the Leibniz rule and the Fundamental Identity. The resulting model
exhibits RVPD symmetry, admits particle-like and noncommutative mem-
brane solutions, and lays the foundation for a Lorentz-invariant, nonper-
turbative matrix description of M2-branes.
Our work oﬀers a new paradigm for constructing Lorentz-invariant
matrix models of membranes, revisiting the algebraic structure underlying
M-theory.

Introduction
In modern particle physics, the fundamental particles that make up the micro-
scopic world are quarks and leptons, which interact with each other through
gauge particles. One of the signiﬁcant features of string theory is that these
particles can be understood as diﬀerent excitation states of “strings,” which are
objects extended in one dimension. Various types of string theories are known,
including Type I, Type IIA, Type IIB, and Heterotic string theories.
To understand why such diﬀerent types of string theories exist, there is
an approach that considers “membranes,” which are objects extended in two
