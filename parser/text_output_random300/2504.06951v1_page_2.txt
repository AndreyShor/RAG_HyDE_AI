of GLT sequences, but also underscored their relevance in diverse scientific domains; see [8, 11, 13, 22] for
a selection of applications in biomedicine, economics, engineering.
The current paper explores the implications of GLT theory within the realm of mean-field quantum spin
systems, with a primary focus on the quantum Curie-Weiss model. As a paradigmatic example of mean-
field interactions in quantum statistical mechanics, the Curie-Weiss model captures key emergent behaviors
-such as spontaneous symmetry breaking and phase transitions- in the asymptotic regime of large system
sizes [28, 29]. The motivation for this study stems from the mathematical complexity inherent in analyzing
quantum spin models, especially in the thermodynamic limit where the number of lattice sites becomes
large. While prior research has addressed various aspects of these systems, ranging from spectral properties
to the decay of correlations and critical phenomena, a systematic understanding grounded in GLT theory is
still lacking. GLT sequences offer a powerful and compact framework to describe the asymptotic behavior of
large matrix sequences, making them particularly well-suited to tackle these challenges. By leveraging the
structure of GLT theory, we aim to deepen the analytical understanding of mean-field models, which play
a central role in condensed matter physics. This necessitates a multidimensional approach that integrates
theoretical insights with physical interpretations, ensuring a comprehensive perspective on the problem. By
combining probability theory, GLT theory, and numerical methods, this paper aims to establish a novel
framework for treating mean-field quantum spin systems as GLT sequences, thereby contributing to both
the advancement of mathematical theory and its applications in physics.
The present article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the main tools from asymptotic linear
algebra and especially on the GLT theory. In Section 3 and Section 4 we study the spectral distribution of two
matrix-sequences arising in the Curie-Weiss model, namely the unrestricted one and the restricted version.
The spectral distributions are checked numerically in Section 5, together with other more specific features
by discussing the links with the analytical properties and the related GLT symbols. Section 6 contains
conclusions and an indication of future fruitful research directions, that could stem from the current work.

Matrix-sequences with explicit and hidden structures
In this section, we first provide formal definitions of spectral and singular value distributions. Then we
present two classes of matrices with explicit structures i.e., diagonal sampling matrices and Toeplitz matrices.
Subsequently, we consider asymptotic notions which make sense only for matrix-sequences: we consider in
fact the zero-distributed matrix-sequences and the ∗-algebras of d-level, r-block generalized locally Toeplitz
(GLT) matrix-sequences, whose construction is involved [25, 26, 27] and needs topological tools [12] like
those related to approximating class of sequences [24, 1]. Instead we briefly present an equivalent axiomatic
characterization taken from the books [14, 15] for r = 1, d ≥1 and from the works [5, 6] for the general
setting with d, r ≥1. For our results on the specific problems in Section 3 and in Section 4 the case d = r = 1
