Area Network, utility, substation and regulatory objects need some type of address. For this reason,
they are configured as Internet Protocol (IP) networks, with an IP version 4 address and subnetwork
mask, as defined by the attribute networklan. This IP configuration allows us to segment a utility
into Operational Technology (OT) network, routing network, and corporate network. These three
types of networks are collectively known as the SuperNet network. SAM-GT’s ability to create
cyber and physical objects allows us to model nodes and links with specialized functions. Each
function is relevant to the type of network the node belongs to; for example, an OT network would
have specialized nodes such as relays and relay controllers. Once all the objects are created, the
algorithm outputs all the elements with their attributes into a JSON file.

Visualizing Network and Validating Metrics. After SAM-GT generates the JSON files, it
creates graphs to enhance the visualization of the cyber-physical network. The graphs are plotted
using NetworkX software tool, with JSON files as inputs. It generates two graphs: an external view
that represents the wide area network, and an internal view that represents the local area networks
inside substations, control center, and balancing authority. The results of these WAN and LAN
views are presented in Sections 5.3 and 5.4.

Metrics for Analysis
Metrics are chosen to compare and determine which network topologies are efficient and reli-
able [17]. The metrics used in this paper are relevant to researchers who study the performance,
resilience, and cybersecurity of these communication network topologies, as detailed next:
(1) Average Path Length (𝐿𝑎𝑣𝑒) is the average distance, measured in the number of hops,
between two nodes in the network. All links are considered to have a cost of one; in other
words, no weights are assigned to the links. All distances 𝑑(𝑥,𝑦) are calculated as the
shortest distance between nodes 𝑥and 𝑦. The sum of all these shortest distances is divided
by the total number of nodes 𝑛, as in Eq. 1.
