compared to the results in [13]. There is additional term in the multiplication factor due to
the presence of θ-term, (sin(γ) −H0 cos(γ)). This would imply electric charge of the BPS
dyons get additional contribution from the θ-term coupling H0, which is in accordance to
the result found by Witten [15]. The values of H0, besides γ, also determine whether the
solutions are BPS monopoles or dyons. For particular values of H0 = tan(γ), there exist
only BPS monopole solutions, while any other values will give us BPS dyons.
Without θ-term, by taking H0 = 0, the only way to get BPS dyons with opposite
electric ﬁeld, E →−E while keeping B →B, is to tune the parameter γ →−γ. However
such transformation can only be done at the ﬁeld equation level and is the implication of
CP symmetry. Another way to do it is by turning on the θ-term with a particular value
H0 = 2 tan(γ). In general tuning the θ-term coupling,
H0 →2 tan(γ) −H0,
(5.1)
will result in changing electric charge of the BPS dyons to its opposite value, (E, B) →
(−E, B).
The case where H is not constant, or depends on spatial coordinates, is quite interest-
ing. The electric ﬁelds are given by
Ei(⃗r) = (sin(γ) −H(⃗r) cos(γ)) G
w DiΦ.
(5.2)
The electric ﬁelds of BPS dyons will vary on space.
There is a possible conﬁguration
where values of the electric ﬁelds are divided into three regions (positive, zero, negative).
Although the electric charge of BPS dyons depends on contribution of the electric ﬁelds
in the whole space, this conﬁguration of the electric ﬁelds is diﬀerent from the normal
conﬁguration where the electric ﬁelds are positive/negative in the whole space. In this
conﬁguration another BPS dyon may be trapped inside a ﬁnite region where the values of
electric ﬁelds are zero. We limit our discussion in this article for the case of constant H.
Nevertheless, should we took H to be constant in the beginning, we would not be able to
see the eﬀect of θ-term in the electric charge of BPS dyons since the constraint equations
(3.19) and (3.22) depend on derivative of H only.
