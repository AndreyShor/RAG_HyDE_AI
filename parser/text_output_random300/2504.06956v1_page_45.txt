P(M0,2b(Υb) ̸= M0,j(Υb), M0,b(Υb) ≤λ) .
By using Lemmas 4.9, 4.10 and a version of Lemma A.11 for Brownian motions (see e.g. [BL18,
Lemma 4.18]), we have that

is bounded by a finite positive constant times the following probability
P(M0,j,k/2(Υb) ≥M0,j(Υb) −λ, M0,b(Υb) ≤λ) .
Once again, by using Lemmas 4.9, 4.10 and [BL18, Lemma 4.18], we have that

depends on the values of ϕ inside a compact subsets of Rd. Furthermore, since λ ∈Λ, the set of
discontinuities of the above mapping is assigned measure zero by the law of the field eΥλ in C(Rd) (see
Remark 5.2). Hence, by combining (5.8) and Steps 1 and 2, by taking the limit as b →∞, and using
Theorems A and B, we obtain that
