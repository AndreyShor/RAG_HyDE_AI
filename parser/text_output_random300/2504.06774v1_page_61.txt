Debugging Deep Learning Models
Debugging plays a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability and robustness of deep learning
models. Unlike traditional software debugging, addressing issues in neural networks often
requires identifying subtle problems related to data, architecture, hyperparameters, and
optimization strategies.
This section outlines key aspects of debugging deep learning
models, supported by systematic techniques and tools to enhance model performance and
reliability.
Key Aspects of Debugging:
Debugging neural networks involves a wide range of
activities, from ensuring data consistency to diagnosing architectural inefficiencies. The
following key aspects are critical for this process [47]:
Data and Preprocessing:
Data quality and consistency are fundamental to the success
of deep learning models. Debugging in this context focuses on the following:
• Input Data Inspection: Ensuring that input data are properly normalized and
scaled while avoiding distortions that could mislead the model.
• Consistency Across Splits: Verifying that training, development, and test sets
share the same distribution. Mismatched distributions can lead to biased evaluations
and poor generalization.
Monitoring Loss and Metrics:
Loss curves and evaluation metrics provide valuable
insights into model performance during training. This includes:
• Loss Curves: Monitoring training and development loss curves helps identify po-
tential issues such as diverging or plateauing trends, often caused by inappropriate
learning rates or initialization strategies.
• Evaluation Metrics: Comparing performance in the dev and test sets allows the
detection of overfitting or underfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen
data.
Gradient Checking:
Gradient checking is a numerical technique for validating the
accuracy of backpropagation implementations. By comparing analytical gradients (com-
puted during backpropagation) with numerical approximations, the method ensures that
gradient computation is error-free, especially when using custom layers or loss functions.
