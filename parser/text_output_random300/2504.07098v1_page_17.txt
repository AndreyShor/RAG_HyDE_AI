Appendix B: Exact solutions of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation
We found that the solutions φs
1,2(x) can be written in closed form in terms of hypergeometric functions in the case where m(y)
and v(y) can be expanded in powers of y, and these expansions can be truncated at the second order and first order, respectively,
as
m(x) =m0 + m1y(x) + m2y(x)2,
(B1a)
v(x) =v0 + v1y(x),
(B1b)
where m0 = mL, m1 = mR −mL −m2, m2 = 2(mL + mR) −4m(0), v0 = vL, and v1 = vR −vL. At the zeroth order,
Eq. (B1) describes the cases of constant fields m(x) = mL,R = m0 when m1 = m2 = 0 and v(x) = vL,R = v0 when v1 = 0.
At the first order, Eq. (B1) describes the case where the fields follow an S-shaped curve interpolating between vL = v0 and
vR = v0 + v1 for x = ±∞, and interpolating between mL = m0 and mR = m0 + m1 when m2 = 0. In particular, a symmetric
S-shaped curve interpolating between vL = v0 and vR = −v0 for x = ±∞is obtained if v1 = −2v0. At the second order, m(x)
in Eq. (B1) describes the symmetric Pöschl–Teller potential with mL,R = m0 in the case where m1 + m2 = 0 and an asymmetric
Pöschl–Teller potential, i.e., a superposition of a Pöschl–Teller potential and an S-shaped potential otherwise.
If the expansion in Eq. (B1) holds, Eq. (A7) simplifies to
F ′′(y) + c −(a + b + 1)y

y(1 −y)F(y) = 0,

(B3c)
The explicit expressions for F1,2 in Eqs. (A9) and (A11) are obtained by taking two solutions of the hypergeometric equation, i.e,
choosing two linearly independent solutions out of the Kummer’s 24 solutions of the hypergeometric equation, which yields
f1(y) = 2F1 (a, b, c, y) ,
(B4a)
f2(y) = 2F1 (a, b, a + b −c + 1, 1 −y) .
(B4b)
Notice that, if one considers higher order terms in Eq. (B1), the resulting equation will not reduce to a hypergeometric equation
in the general case. The equation above admits solutions that can be written in terms of two linearly independent solutions given
by hypergeometric functions, although the choice is not unique. Hence, the explicit expressions for F1,2 in Eq. (A9) are obtained
by taking
F1(y) = 2F1(a1, b1, c1, y),
(B5a)
F2(y) = 2F1(a2, b2, c2, 1 −y),
(B5b)
where a1, b1, c1 and a2, b2, c2 are obtained from Eq. (B3) by substituting (αL, αR) = (α+
L, α−
R) and (αL, αR) = (α−
L, α+

provided that the corresponding solutions of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation in Eq. (A9) are linearly independent and can
satisfy the boundary conditions. We notice that a1 −a2 = b1 −b2 = c1 −c2 and that b1,2 = 1 −a2,1.
