recalling that y(t0) = u0 and that Ut is also locally defined at some point u ∈U. Performing the total derivative

where (t, u) ∈S, ∂t := ∂/∂t, ∂j := ∂/∂uj and where we have removed the time index of the generator for simplicity.
Under these considerations, the Koopman generator U and the infinitesimal generator v both act on smooth functions
[Remark S24] and can be manipulated together. The next lemma is the equivalent of Thm. (S23) for systems of
first-order ODEs and provides the infinitesimal criterion of symmetry in terms of the Koopman generator.
Lemma S8. [Lemma of the paper] A connected local group of transformations G acting on an open subset S ⊂T ×U
is a symmetry group of the dynamics in Eq. (S80) if and only if
[U, v] −U[ξ(t, u)]U = 0
(S83)
for every infinitesimal generator v = ξ(t, u)∂t + PN
j=1 ϕj(t, u)∂j of G.
Proof. To begin with, Lem. S7 ensures that the dynamics (S80) is nondegenerate, which guarantees that Thm. S23 can
be applied. Now, since the dynamics is a first-order system of ODEs, only the first prolongation of the infinitesimal
generator v is needed. By the general prolongation formula in Ref. [60, Theorem 2.36], the first prolongation of v is

Dt = d/dt is the total derivative. The dependencies on t, u, ˙u are omitted in Eq. (S84) to simplify the notation, as
will be done from now on. The infinitesimal condition for G to be a symmetry group is then

Applying Thm. S23 to our particular case, a connected local group of transformations G is a symmetry group if
and only if Eqs. (S85) are satisfied. It now remains to show that Eqs. (S85) are equivalent to condition (S83). The
commutator of U and v is
