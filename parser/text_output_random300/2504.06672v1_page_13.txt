mantics from the retrieved videos - aligning with our goal of
enhancing generated motion in a generalizable way. How-
ever, for motion transfer, we can adapt our method accord-
ingly. In practice, given a driving video, we overfit the con-
troller network to that specific video to achieve the desired
effect. Notably, the design of our architecture and pretrain-
ing on WebVid-10M facilitate this adaptation process, mak-
ing it more efficient compared to other methods that require
fine-tuning on the target video. Compared to Motion Di-
rector [60] (which relies on the same backbone video gen-
erator), our method achieves similar performance while re-
quiring eight times less fine-tuning (50 vs 400 iterations),
demonstrating the efficiency of our RAG-first design.
