cal results do not agree as well as was the case for the
minimal chain. One reason for this might be the simpli-
fied optimization algorithm for µN/S,n in the three-site
chain, since it can get stuck in local minima. Another
explanation is that, as the chain is extended, there can
be additional mechanisms that cause PMMs going be-
yond localized states in double QD systems. This claim
is supported by the fact that true and false PMMs are
found even in regions where µN/S,a are not defined (white
regions in Fig. 4). As discussed above, false PMMs with-
out a ZEC do not have to solve Eq. (12) and thus it is not
surprising that these states exist in regions of parameter
space where Eqs. (12) and (15) do not have a common
solution. However, the fact that false PMMs with a ZEC
exist in these regions of parameter space is an indica-
tion that the physics of false PMMs can be even richer
in longer chains than what is considered in this section.

EFFECT OF THRESHOLD VALUES ON
THE RATIO OF TRUE AND FALSE PMMS
As was demonstrated in Ref. 73, it is difficult to distin-
guish false and true PMMs based solely on conductance
measurements as they have similar properties. However,
we found in Sec. III that true and false PMMs appear in
relatively distinct regions of parameter space if ∆Z/∆is
fixed. Therefore, one might think that increased knowl-
edge about the system parameters can help to distin-
guish true from false PMMs. However, the question arises
whether distinct regions in the t versus ΦSOI parameter
space remain if ∆Z is varied as well. Furthermore, al-
though well-defined in a theoretical model, t and ΦSOI are
not easily measurable parameters of experimental setups.
Thus, in this section, we study whether true and false
PMMs can be distinguished without having full knowl-
edge of the parameter space and the effect of the thresh-
old values on the ratio of true to false PMMs. In this
section, we limit the discussion to minimal chains with
N = 2.
Whether a state is classified as a PMM depends on the
threshold values chosen in Eq. (8). Therefore, it is nat-
ural to assume that the ratio of true to false PMMs also
depends on the threshold values. To investigate this, we
set random values for ∆Z/∆, t/∆, and ΦSOI, then deter-
mine the chemical potentials µN,n and µS,n following the
optimization algorithm described in Ref. 72 to search for
PMMs. It is important to emphasize that this algorithm
attempts to find the optimal chemical potentials such
that the characteristics are closest to those of a perfect
PMM, however, it does not rule out other (disconnected)
regions of parameter space that could also satisfy the
threshold conditions and result in an imperfect PMM. It
should also be noted that, during the optimization pro-
cess, we do not optimize for a large excitation gap Eex,
but simply check after the optimization if the excitation
gap exceeds the threshold value Eex,th. As expected, the
stricter the threshold values for the TR are, the fewer

(a)-(i): Histograms showing the Zeeman energies ∆Z
[panels (a)-(c)], SOI angles ΦSOI [panels (d)-(f)], and hop-
ping amplitudes t [panels (g)-(i)] of true and false PMMs
in minimal chains.
Note that the histograms of true and
false PMMs are stacked.
In panels (a), (d), and (g) the
MP threshold is Mth = 0.01, in panels (b), (e), and (h)
Mth = 0.1, and in panels (c), (f), and (i) Mth = 0.3. (j): Ra-
tio of true PMMs compared to the total number of PMMs,
as a function of Mth (black symbols). The red symbols in-
dicate the total number of PMMs. The data indicated with
dots (crosses) has a threshold value for the excitation gap of
Eex,th/∆= 0.1 (Eex,th/∆= 0.4). The stricter the thresh-
old values are, i.e., the smaller Mth or the larger Eex,th, the
fewer states are overall classified as PMMs, but the more
likely it is that these are true PMMs.
As the threshold
values are relaxed, more states satisfy the TR condition de-
fined in Eq. (8) but the ratio of true PMMs decreases. The
threshold values are ∆Eth/∆= 10−4, ∆Qth = 0.01, and
Eex,th/∆= 0.1 for panels (a)-(i).
The randomly selected
values for the Zeeman energy are limited to 0 ≤∆Z/∆≤4,
for the SOI angle 0 ≤ΦSOI ≤π/2, and for the hopping am-
plitude 0 ≤t/∆≤2.5. In total, 1500 distinct combinations
of (t, ΦSOI, ∆Z) are used for this plot.
states are classified as PMMs. Neither ∆Z nor t alone
are good indicators of whether a state is a true or false
PMMs, see Fig. 5. In contrast, ΦSOI, in combination with
a low value for Mth, seems to be useful to distinguish true
from false PMMs, as PMMs that appear at low or high
values of ΦSOI have a high chance of being false PMMs,
whereas PMMs at intermediate values of ΦSOI are likely
to be true PMMs. This observation agrees well with the
analytical understanding derived in Sec. III.
In certain cases, the ratio of true PMMs can reach
100%, i.e., all states produced by the optimization algo-
rithm that satisfy the TR condition are true PMMs, see
Fig. 5(j). However, in these cases there are only very few
states that satisfy the TR condition and therefore, the
statistical significance of these results is low.
In addi-
tion, more fine-tuning is required in this case to have a
PMM in the system. As the threshold values for the TR
are relaxed, more states are classified as PMMs, but the
ratio of true PMMs drops well below 100%, see Fig. 5(j).
To better understand how the classification of PMMs
depends on the threshold values, we study the distribu-
tion of true and false PMMs in the t versus ΦSOI pa-
rameter space for different threshold values, see Fig. 6.
