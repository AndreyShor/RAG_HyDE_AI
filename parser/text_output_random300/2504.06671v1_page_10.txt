Adding to the complexity, each defect can exist in multiple charge states within the SiC bandgap, further 
influencing their electronic transitions, optical emission properties, and spin characteristics. The ability to 
precisely control and identify these charge states is critical for optimizing defect-based qubits, as 
unwanted charge-state fluctuations can degrade coherence and readout fidelity [53, 54].  This remains 
one of the most significant challenges: the selection and stabilization of the desired charge states. As 
discussed in the following sections, color centers in SiC can exist in multiple charge states, but only specific 
ones are suitable for quantum applications.  
The first step in the creation of defect-based qubits is the controlled introduction of defects into SiC. This 
is typically achieved through ion implantation or high-energy irradiation, both of which introduce lattice 
vacancies and interstitials that can later form stable defect centers. Figure 6 (left side) schematically 
illustrates ion implantation and high-energy irradiation, two widely used techniques for defect 
engineering in SiC. In the case of ion implantation, a high-energy ion beam (such as He, C, N, or other 
species) is used to displace Si and C atoms in a specific volume of the SiC material. The implantation energy 
determines how deep the defects are introduced, enabling precise spatial control over defect placement. 
However, a significant drawback of this method is that other unwanted defects are created along the ion 
cascade, which can impact the material’s properties. Unlike ion implantation, which introduces defects in 
a localized manner, high-energy irradiation (e.g., electron or neutron irradiation) generates vacancies and 
interstitials uniformly throughout the material. This technique ensures a more homogeneous distribution 
of defects, but it lacks the spatial precision offered by ion implantation.  
To determine implantation or irradiation conditions, such as estimating the depth profile and distribution 
of vacancy-related defects in SiC, various simulation tools are commonly employed. For ion implantation,
