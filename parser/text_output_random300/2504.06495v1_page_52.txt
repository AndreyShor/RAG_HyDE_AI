Proof of Theorem 2.
We prove the result by showing that, under the limit regime
ǫ →0, t →∞, and ǫ t →∞, the discrete-time process deﬁned in (14) converges to the
continuous-time process of Theorem 3, and that the ratio of survival probabilities converges
accordingly.
# Rescaling and functional limit: Let {X(ǫ)
t }t≥0 be the discrete-time process with ab-
sorption at log(ǫ), and deﬁne the rescaled process13
Y (ǫ)(τ) := X(ǫ)
⌊τ/ǫ⌋,
τ ≥0.
This accelerates time by a factor of 1/ǫ and enables comparison with continuous-time dynam-
ics. By the functional central limit theorem for the unconstrained process (e.g., Billingsley,
1999, Theorem 14.1) and the continuous mapping theorem for stopping times (e.g., Billingsley,
1999, Theorem 13.6; see also Whitt, 2002, Chapter 13), the rescaled process with absorption
converges in distribution, as ǫ →0, to the diﬀusion {Xτ}τ≥0 solving
dXτ = −µ dτ + σ dWτ,
X0 = x,
with absorption at log(ǫ). The assumptions on the i.i.d. shocks Ut ensure that the FCLT
applies to the unconstrained process, and the continuity of Brownian sample paths guaran-
tees that hitting times and survival probabilities also converge via the continuous mapping
theorem.
13One could introduce a separate time-rescaling parameter δ > 0 and deﬁne the rescaled process as
Y (δ)(τ) := X(ǫ)
⌊τ/δ⌋, with appropriate asymptotics ensuring ǫt = (ǫ/δ)τ →∞.
However, setting δ = ǫ
simpliﬁes notation and is suﬃcient for the functional limit argument used here.
