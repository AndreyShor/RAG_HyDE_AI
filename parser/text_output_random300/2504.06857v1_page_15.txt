FIG. 11: Unfolded CC0Ï€ differential cross sections as functions of the three STVs, compared against the true cross
sections underlying the data. Only events with a true proton momentum > 450 MeV are included for these
comparisons. Error bars are the spread in results from 500 pseudo-experiments varying systematic and statistical
uncertainties, and the nominal result in each bin is the mean from those 500 unfolded throws. Left: unfolded cross
sections from IBU-UniFold and MultiFold compared against the true cross sections used to generate the data.
Right: per-bin ratios of the unfolded cross sections from IBU-UniFold and MultiFold compared against the true
cross sections for the data. The prior shows the mean and standard deviation of each bin from the 500
pseudo-experiments before applying any unfolding procedure.
