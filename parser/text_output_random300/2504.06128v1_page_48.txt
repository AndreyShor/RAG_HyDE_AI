(B.9)
Plugging these bounds into (B.6), we obtain the second and third line in (5.15).
We next attach the factors p and q from (B.8) and (B.9) to Ξbulkprq. To complete the
proof of (5.15), recalling (5.14), it suffices to show that for a suitable constant Kpˆtq

We bound the terms in (B.7) as follows:†

This completes the proof.

†Propositions 4.13 and 4.24 in [CCR23] require that β ď β0phq for a suitable β0phq ą 0 depending on the
disorder distribution (to ensure that Erpeβω´λpβqqps ď Erpeβω´λpβqq2s “ σ2
β for all 3 ď p ď h). This is why
the same requirement appears in Theorem 5.7.
