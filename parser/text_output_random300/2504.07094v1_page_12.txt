Finally, the third quadratic term is minimized when no
branching is present and thus penalizes cases where three
or more bonds meet at the same lattice site. Combining
this constraint with the first one, i.e., that the number of
active bonds is equal to the number of sites, implies that
each site has exactly two incident bonds and is, therefore,
part of a closed chain.
Thus, minimizing all three terms simultaneously yields
a binary encoding of self-assembled polymers that sat-
isfy the physical requirements of being space-filling, self-
avoiding, and exclusively consisting of closed chains. No-
tice that the number of closed chains is not fixed and is
determined by the self-assembly combinatorics.
The ground states of the QUBO Hamiltonian of eq. 21,
which by construction correspond to HN = 0, are thus
in one-to-one correspondence with the configurations of
maximally-dense melts of rings.
A schematic representation of the Γ−and Γ⌞of a
ground state solution of HN is shown in Fig. 6.
For
clarity, the illustrated case is for a two-dimensional 4 × 4
lattice.
QUBO-based sampling for a bending energy interval
As noted in connection with eq. 13, a natural parame-
ter for profiling the density of states W is the total num-
ber of corner turns, nc. This quantity is proportional to
the total curvature and, hence, is the conjugate variable
of the bending rigidity. In the ground state manifold HN,
nc can be directly computed from the number of active
Γ⌞variables in the ground states of HN:
nc =
X
⟨ijk⟩

ijk .

The

W(nc) can thus be achieved by adding to HN a quadratic
term proportional to:

In fact, minimizing HN + AHs with A > 0 allows for
sampling states in the interval ¯nc ≤nc ≤¯nc + 2m−1.
Repeating the sampling procedure for overlapping in-
tervals covering the entire range of nc, and applying the
reconstruction method of section 1, one can obtain the
full profile of the density of states W().
Ring melt composition versus bending rigidity
The composition of the self-assembled rings melts is
conveniently characterized in terms of the average num-
ber of self-assembled rings at fixed temperature and
bending rigidity, ⟨Nrings⟩βκb.
We recall that the num-
ber of chains in self-assembling polymer systems can
be controlled with extrinsic design parameters, such
as monomer density, and intrinsic ones, such as the
monomers’ bonding volume [91]. In our case, the former
is fixed by the space-filling conditions, while the latter is
varied via the bending rigidity.
We computed ⟨Nrings⟩βκb using eq. 13 after identifying
⟨O⟩nc with the average number of rings per each admis-
sible value of nc, ⟨Nrings⟩nc.
Fig. 7 illustrates the resulting profile of ⟨Nrings⟩βκb,
obtained by averaging five independent reconstructions.
The shaded band denotes the estimated statistical error
on the average profile, which is typically smaller than
0.6% except for βκb < 4.

FIG. 7.
Average number of self-assembled rings as
a function of the reduced bending rigidity βκb. The
results are for a canonically equilibrated ring melt filling a
5 × 5 × 4 cubic lattice. The data points represent the average
Plink computed from 4 reconstructions and the shaded bands
indicate the standard error of the mean. The considered range
of βκb spans from −8 to +8, i.e.
from strongly favoured
to strongly suppressed corner turns. Across this range, the
average number of rings is non-monotonic, having a minimum
at βκb ∼1.5.
For βκb > 4, ⟨Nrings⟩βκb≫0 plateaus at about 6.5. In
this regime of large bending rigidity, typical configura-
tions of the ring melt correspond to nested stacked rings,
which typically involves approximately 7 rings on 5×5×4
space-filled lattice, as illustrated in Fig. 2e.
For βκb < −4, instead, ⟨Nrings⟩plateaus to about 9.
This larger asymptotic value reflects the fact that, when
chain turns are favored, the rings are smaller and hence
more numerous, as shown in Fig. 2b.
Fig. 7 shows that in between two asymptotic values
⟨Nrings⟩βκb is minimum for βκb ∼1.7, where it is slightly
smaller than 3. A typical configuration for such extremal
case is shown in Fig. 2g-h.
