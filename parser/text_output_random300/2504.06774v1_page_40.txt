Figure 24: (a) Ground truth streamwise velocity components at t = 3828. (b) Comparison
of the predicted streamwise velocity components for HOSVD (left column) and SVD (right
column) across different LSTM architectures. From top to bottom: predictions for LSTM
with 1 Dense, 2 Dense, and Time-Distributed architectures.
The UQ results for the experimental wake flow case, shown in Figure 28, provide a
compelling perspective on predictive reliability in this challenging noise-influenced tur-
bulent data set. For the HOSVD-based models, the error distributions are consistently
narrow and sharply centered around zero for all LSTM architectures. This indicates high
reliability and minimal variability in the predictions. The sharp peaks in the UQ plots
underscore the robustness of HOSVD in capturing the underlying flow features with a high
degree of confidence. Among the architectures, the LSTM 2 dense and time-distributed
