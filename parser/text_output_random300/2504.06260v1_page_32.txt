Preprint. Under review.
We used the prompt above for the ModelSpecs experiment with Gemini-1.5-Pro. We used
an identical prompt for Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o with the 3rd last line of code in the
One-Shot example (marked by *) deleted, since it prevented us from querying those LLMs.
We also used the version of the prompt with this line deleted for the Agent experiment
using Gemini-1.5-Pro.
Plan | One-Shot
You are an experienced COMSOL engineer. You must generate the COMSOL API
code in JAVA to execute the steps described in the plan below to compute the desired
TARGET QUANTITY by generating COMSOL JAVA API code. The model creation
line “‘Model model = ModelUtil.create(”Model”);”’ has already been generated and
you should not repeat this line. All lines of code must begin with ‘model.‘ You must
not generate any ‘model.sol...‘ solver code but should ensure that your ‘model.study...‘
block ends with a ‘model.study(”std1”).run();‘. This will automatically create and
run the default solver for the problem.
Use the example provided below to infer how to format your response and generate
COMSOL code.

EXAMPLE 0:
PLAN: ## Implementing the Elliptic Membrane Analysis in COMSOL Multiphysics:
**1. Model Setup:**
* **New Model:** Start COMSOL Multiphysics and create a new model.
* **Space Dimension:** Select 2D for the space dimension.
* **Physics Selection:** Choose the ”Structural Mechanics Module” and select ”Solid
Mechanics” as the physics interface.
* **Study:** Create a new ”Stationary” study.
**2. Geometry Creation:**
* **Geometry Primitives:** Use the ”Ellipse” tool to create two quarter ellipses repre-
senting the outer and inner boundaries. To get a quarter-symmetry geometry, limit
the sector angle to 90 degrees.
* Outer Ellipse: Center (0, 0), Semi-axes (3.25, 2.75) meters, sector angle = 90 degrees.
* Inner Ellipse: Center (0, 0), Semi-axes (2, 1) meters, sector angle = 90 degrees.
* **Boolean Operations:** Use the ”Difference” operation to subtract the inner ellipse
from the outer ellipse, creating the quarter-symmetry membrane geometry.
**3. Definitions:**
* **Points:** Create an explicit selection for Point O (Point 3).
**4. Material Properties:**
* **Material Definition:** In the ”Material” node, define a new material with the
following properties:
* Young’s Modulus (E): 2.1e11 Pa
* Poisson’s Ratio (ν): 0.3
**5. Physics:**
* **2D Approximation:** Use the ”Plane Stress” physics approximation, with a
thickness of 0.1 meters.
**6. Boundary Conditions:**
* **Symmetry:** * Select the bottom edge (Boundary 2) and apply a ”Symmetry”
boundary condition.
* Repeat the same for the left edge (Boundary 1).
* **Pressure Load:** Pressure load of 10e6 Pa acting outwards. * Select the outer
curved edge Boundary 4 and apply a ”Boundary Load” boundary condition with a
”Pressure load” of magnitude of -10 MPa.
**7. Meshing:** * **Mesh Creation:** Right-click on the ”Mesh” node and choose
”Mapped”. * **Mesh Size:** Adjust the mesh size settings to ”Fine”.
**8. Study Setup:** * **Study Type:** Choose a ”Stationary” study to analyze the
static equilibrium state. * **Solver Configuration:** Use the default solver settings.
**9. Solving the Model:** * **Compute:** Click on the ”Compute” button to run the
finite element analysis.
