BASICS ON COMPOSITE SYSTEMS
The Hilbert space of a composite quantum system is
the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of the involved
systems, see, e.g., Ref. [48]. For bipartite systems, we
call them system A and B. To create operators in the full
Hilbert space that act only on a single component, one
has to take the tensor product of the operator acting on
the subspace of interest, i.e., ˆA and ˆB, with the identity
operators 1A and 1B corresponding to the components
that are to be unchanged, ˆA⊗1B and 1A⊗ˆB. In a matrix
representation the tensor product ⊗is also called Kro-
necker product or matrix direct product. If there is no
interaction between systems A and B, the Hamiltonian
of the composite system is given by the system Hamilto-
nians ˆHA and ˆHB via the Kronecker sum
ˆH = ˆHA ⊕ˆHB = ˆHA ⊗1B + 1A ⊗ˆHB.
(1)
Note that the Kronecker sum is distinct from the direct
sum of two matrices, despite both often being denoted
by the same symbol ⊕.
Equation (1) also pertains to the Liouvillian of a com-
posite quantum system without interaction as well as to
the Liouvillian of a single system if quantum jumps are
ignored, see the supplemental information of Ref. [49], for
example. Moreover, Hamiltonians as in Eq. (1) appear
naturally in two- or higher-dimensional non-Hermitian
lattices [50] and for evolution matrices of higher-order
operator moments [51].

AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE
For illustration purpose, we first introduce a simplified
setting given by a dimensionless toy model. Consider a
system A with a 2-dimensional Hilbert space and a 2 × 2
Hamiltonian at a second-order EP in the given basis
ˆHA =

0 1
0 0

.
(2)
Such an Hamiltonian can appear in optical microdisks
and microrings with fully asymmetric backscattering [52].
The eigenvalue is 0 with algebraic multiplicity of 2 and
the eigenstate is |ψA⟩= (1, 0)T with geometric multiplic-
ity of 1; the superscript T indicates the transpose. Now,
we consider a system B with, for simplicity, exactly the
same Hamiltonian ˆHB = ˆHA at an EP of order 2 having
eigenvalue 0 and eigenstate |ψB⟩= (1, 0)T.
The composite system with Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) is
equivalent to the one in Ref. [47] but computationally
more convenient.
Does the composite system contains
an EP? And if, what is its order? The answer given in
Ref. [47] is 4 and there is a simple and seemingly safe
argument for it (which, however, has not been used in
Ref. [47]): Each of the Hamiltonians ˆHA and ˆHB possess
exactly one eigenstate (the geometric multiplicity is 1),
|ψA⟩and |ψB⟩, and therefore the only tensor product to
form is
|ψEP⟩= |ψA⟩⊗|ψB⟩=



1
0
0
0


.
(3)
As a result, the geometric multiplicity is 1.
Together
with an algebraic multiplicity of 4 (all eigenvalues are
zero) this indicates an EP of order 4. However, direct
calculation of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) proves that this
hasty conclusion is incorrect,
ˆH =



0 1 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0


.
(4)
The eigenvalues are 0 with algebraic multiplicity of 4 and
there are two eigenstates
|ψEP⟩=



1
0
0
0


, |ψ0⟩=



0
−1
1
0



(5)
up to a phase factor and normalization. The additional
eigenstate |ψ0⟩is not a tensor product of the EP eigen-
states of system A and B, in fact it is a (maximally)
entangled state. The geometric multiplicity is therefore
equal to 2. To investigate this further, we employ the
unitary matrix
ˆU :=




0
1
√
2 −1
√




(6)
to transform the Hamiltonian ˆH in Eq. (4) to a Jordan
normal form
ˆU ˆH ˆU † =
√
2




0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0



.

This clearly demonstrates that the composite system ex-
hibits a more complex degeneracy (see for such complex
degeneracies also Refs. [45, 53–55]) consisting of a third-
order EP and a separate eigenstate, each with a zero
eigenvalue. The result is consistent with Ref. [51] which
does not consider composite quantum systems but evo-
lution matrices of higher-order operator moments of the
form as in Eq. (1) with ˆHA = ˆHB at a second-order EP.
It is worth taking a moment to think through the orig-
inal argument of Ref. [47] for the order of the EP in
the composite system. To do so, consider the perturbed
Hamiltonians
ˆHA =
 
0 1
ε 0
!
= ˆHB.
