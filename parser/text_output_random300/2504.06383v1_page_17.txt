Figure S1 shows four different configurations of the minimum mirror magnetic field, B0, in
EXP-A. Panels (a)-(d) present B-dot probe measurements for B0 = 265 G, 305 G, 340 G, and
380 G. The heating efficiency is maximized at B0 = 305 G, where the microwave frequency
matches the third harmonic of local electron gyrofrequency.

FIG. S1: B-dot probe measurements for different minimum mirror magnetic field values.
Panels (a)-(d) correspond to B0 = 265, 305, 340, 380 G, respectively. For (a), (c) and (d),
the shots with the highest magnetic field fluctuations are selected.
