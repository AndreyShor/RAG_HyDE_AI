at different Vg following the sequence of applied Vg in our experiment. The range of the 
applied Vg is between -60 V and 140 V. The optical near-field response between the two 
adjacent polar states (polarization directions indicated by triangles in (a)) becomes 
almost identical at around Vg = 140 V (h), indicating a strong hole doping in the sample 
at Vg = 0 V. This strong hole doping for this specific sample is presumably due to the 
unintentional doping from underlying substrate. Owing to this unintentional hole 
doping, inducing electron doping into the samples is not achieved. w, Optical contrast
