This construction gives us much more than the Z4 anomaly resolution. For
instance, whenever a group G has a normal subgroup Z4 for which the Z2 subgroup
is central in G, then the element (6.51) is a valid gauge twist for the group algebra
C[G], and thus we have an exact sequence of quasi-Hopf algebras
H(2) ↪CF[Z4] ⊂CF[G] Ð→CF[G]/H(2),
(6.61)
and thus a non-invertible anomaly resolution
Rep(G) Ð→Vec(Z2,α).
(6.62)
Some examples of low order are G = D4,Q8 [10,23].
In the next section, we will discuss the mixed anomaly / “quantum symmetry”
phases in this example.

Categorical details
Next, we walk through the details laid out in section 6.4 for the case of the anoma-
lous Z2. Consider a functor F ∶Vec(Z4) →Vec(Z2,α), where Z4 has simple objects
gn, n = 0,1,2,3, and Z2 has simple objects 1 and z. We will take Z4 to be non-
anomalous, meaning there is a canonical choice of associator with trivial phases.
The Z2 may have an anomaly, represented by the cocycle α(z,z,z) = η = ±1, and
the corresponding nontrivial associator is az,z,z = ϕz ∈Hom(z,z).
The functor
must act on objects as
F(1) = F(g2) = 1,
F(g) = F(g3) = z,
(6.63)
and we will take it to act on morphisms simply as F(ϕgn) = ϕF (gn) = ϕzn. It
remains to determine the strong monoidal structure Jgn,gm, which will be given in
terms of a cochain j by
Jgn,gm = j(gn,gm)−1ϕzn+m.
(6.64)
The cocycle must satisfy dj = π∗α, or explicitly (abbreviating j(gn,gm) = jn,m,
with the n and m indices being taken mod 4)
ηmnp = jn,pjm,n+p
jm,njm+n,p
,
(6.65)
where we used the fact that α(zm,zn,zp) = ηmnp. Finding the most general solution
to these conditions results in
jn,0 = j0,m = j0,0,
