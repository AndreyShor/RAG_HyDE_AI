Figure 8. Histogram of averaged Wilson loops over all configurations for 214 configurations on a
lattice of size (32, 8, 8, 8) corresponding to âˆ†(2, 1, 2) = 0. For each configuration, the Wilson loop
winding around each direction is computed at every point on the lattice. Those Wilson loops are
then averaged over all configurations to give an average value of each Wilson loop at every point on
the lattice. We then make histograms of those averages to show how they are distributed across the
lattice. In other words, each count in the histogram corresponds to a different lattice point.

eliminates 4 out of the 8 moduli, leaving Î·, Î¸, Ë†Ï•2, and Ë†Ï•4 in (4.9). We also define Â¯x1 â‰¡L1L2

We contrast these analytical expressions with the numerical lattice data of various con-
figurations obtained for SU(3) with r = 2, k = 1, on the tuned torus with âˆ†(2, 1, 2) = 0 and
sides (32, 8, 8, 8). With the Wilson action density, we have

with respect to the four fitting parameters, Â¯x1 and Â¯x3, Î·, and Î¸. We used the first few integers
mâ€² and nâ€² in equations (A.7, A.8), since contributions from larger integers (in absolute val-
ues) diminish exponentially. The data is then fitted using the standard least squares method,
which optimizes the fit by minimizing the sum of squared differences between theoretical pre-
