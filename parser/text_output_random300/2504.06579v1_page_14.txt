Figure 2. Stay-put probability P1(t) as a function of time t at small times t ≪1/λ (panel
(a)) and at long times t ≫1/λ (panel (b)), with ∆= 1.0, δε = 0.5, λ = 0.005. The data
(points in panel (a) and line in panel (b)) are obtained by evaluating numerically the inverse
Laplace transform of our exact analytical result, Eq. (31). The line in panel (a) corresponds to
Eq. (48). The plots demonstrate a crossover between a low-λ coherence regime and a high-λ
decoherence regime.
line shapes, it has ramifications for more modern quantum trajectory schemes, applied in
mostly quantum optics literature [27]. In that respect, the presently undertaken three-level
scenario can be contrasted with yet another distinct attempt in which all the three levels
belong to the coherently-coupled subsystem, wherein levels 2 and 3 are nearly degenerate but
differently populated with respect to level 1 because of finite-temperature effects [28]. The
latter attempt hinges on how degeneracy slows down decoherence effects, a desired objective
for retaining quantum information. Furthermore, the current treatment has an overlap with our
earlier analyses of projective measurements [20] and quantum resetting [21] in the context of
the tight-binding chain dynamics that models the motion of a quantum particle between the
sites of a one-dimensional lattice. The former refers to projective measurements performed
at random times by means of a detector that detects the presence of the quantum particle on a
target site, while the latter comprises a dynamics in which the density operator is at random
times reset to its initial form [29]. It is worthwhile to mention that both the aforementioned
set-ups are distinctly different from the one studied in the current work.
We now comment on some relevant future directions of the current work. The Rabi
oscillations discussed in the Introduction, and whose manifestation is seen in the behavior
of the quantity P1(t) for our studied model, can also be discerned in a generalized version
of Eq. (7) in which the field in the xy-plane is an oscillatory one that couples to both x- and
y-components of the transverse field [30]. In this case, Eq. (7) acquires a parametric time-
dependence:
H0(t) = −B0σz −B(σx cos(ωt)+σy sin(ωt)).

The consequent phenomena are relevant for magnetic resonance set-up, either of the nuclear
type (NMR) or of the electron type (ESR) [18]. By going to a frame that rotates around
