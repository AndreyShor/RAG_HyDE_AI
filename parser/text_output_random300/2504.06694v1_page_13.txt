Deﬁnition 3.9 (formal Frobenius manifolds). Let M be a complex connected manifold of ﬁnite dimen-
sion, and t := {tα} be formal coordinates on an open subset V ⊂M. Choose suﬃciently small open
subset U of V so that we could assume O(U) = C[[t]]. On the local coordinates (U, t), let us write
∂α ◦∂β :=
X
γ
Aγ
αβ∂γ.
where {∂α := ∂/∂tα} is a basis of TM and Aγ
αβ ∈C[[t]] is a formal power series representing the 3-tensor
ﬁeld. Let g be a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear pairing on C-vector space spanned by {∂α}. Then
one can extend g to a symmetric CJtK-linear pairing. Let gαβ := g(∂α, ∂β) ∈C . Then (M, ◦, g) is called
a formal Frobenius manifold if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

Barannikov–Kontsevich constructed a formal non-trivial Frobenius manifold structure on H0
pr(PV(X))
extending the CY Frobenius algebra (H0
pr(PV(X)), ∧, ⟨−, −⟩CY).
Theorem 3.10. [2] There exists a 3-tensor Aγ
αβ(s) ∈CJsK and the metric gαβ ∈C (which is given by
⟨−, −⟩CY) in a formal ﬂat coordinate system s = (s1, · · · , sµ) on H0
pr(PV(X)), where µ = dim H0
pr(PV(X)),
which provides a formal Frobenius manifold structure on H0
pr(PV(X)) extending11 the CY Frobenius al-
gebra (H0
pr(PV(X)), ∧, ⟨−, −⟩CY).
Now we can transport the formal non-trivial Frobenius manifold structure to the Frobenius algebra
(A(f), •LG, ⟨−, −⟩LG): Corollary 3.3 combined with Theorem 3.10 implies Corollary 1.2.
3.4. Comparison with Isolated Singularities. Let us discuss Frobenius manifold structures on the
case when P = Pr−1 is the projective space and Xf ⊂Pr−1 is smooth:
Remark 3.11. Note that there is no direct relationship between the Jacobian algebra R(f) and the
total cohomology group H•(PV(X)), but there is a concrete ring isomorphism between their subalgebras,
namely, between A(f) and H0(PV(X)) as we saw in Theorem 3.1. The CY ring structure was put to use
in [2] to construct a formal Frobenius manifold structure on H•(PV(X)) in the context of Calabi–Yau B-
model of mirror symmetry. On the other hand, the polynomial ring structure (the LG ring structure) on
S = C[z] was used to construct a Frobenius manifold structure on R(f) by the theory of primitive forms
and the higher residue parings associated to a universal unfolding of an isolated singularity f [17, 18];
this Frobenius manifold structure is the main player in the context of Landau–Ginzburg B-model of
mirror symmetry.
We observe that the Frobenius manifold structure on H•(PV(X)) based on the CY ring structure
(see [2] and its generalization [1]) restricts to H0(PV(X)) and the Frobenius manifold structure on R(f)
based on the LG ring structure (see [17, 18] and also [10], [7, Section 3] for its concrete algorithm) also
restricts to A(f). Therefore, there are two types (CY versus LG) of constructions of Frobenius manifolds
on Hr−2
pr (X), each of which is an important invariant in the context of the B-model CY and LG mirror
symmetry, respectively.
