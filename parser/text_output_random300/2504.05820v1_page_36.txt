quark couples to the virtual gauge boson. This definition is infrared-safe. However, a naive
definition of Hj
i,k based on the tag of heavy final state would not be theoretically sound, due to
gluon splitting. Depending on whether one considers massive partons in the initial or final state,
there are several modifications that need to be introduced in the DIS factorization Eq. (1.79).
First let us consider the process, often called heavy quark open production,
ℓ(k) + p(P) →ℓ′(k′) + h + X ,
(1.93)
where we require to have a massive quark h with mass mh in the final state. The presence of a
massive particle requires to impose a kinematic cut in the convolution range with the PDF in
Eq. (1.79), which now reads for massless to massive structure functions

with xmax = (1 + 4m2
h/Q2)−1 for NC, where the heavy quarks are created in pairs and xmax =
(1 + m2
h/Q2)−1 for CC. In the former case, the process cannot occur at LO and at NLO is driven
by the gluon channel, while the latter starts at LO. 4 The massive coefficient functions are
known exactly up to NNLO for photon [71, 72], Z [73, 26] and W [74, 75] exchange while at
N3LO only partial results are available in Ref. [76, 77, 78, 79], or in the Q2 ≫m2
h limit [80,
81, 82, 83, 84] (see also Section 4.2.1). Massive coefficients differ from the massless ones also
because of the parity structure. In fact, in the case of Z boson exchange and parity conserving
structure functions, the axial vector-axial vector coefficient function is no longer equal to the
vector-vector piece which contributes both to the photon and Z exchange.
The case of initial massive partons is more involved; the factorization formula requires also to
sum over the PDF of the massive quark which is then called intrinsic. In this case, we add a
further contribution to Eq. (1.94) given by

for NC and CC respectively. The intrinsic coefficient functions are available only up to NLO [85],
with the CC part computed very recently [7, 86]. Intrinsic polarized coefficient functions are not
yet known. In Tables 1.3 and 1.4 we collect a summary of the coefficient functions as currently
available in literature and implemented in Yadism (see Section 2.1.2), both for the polarized
