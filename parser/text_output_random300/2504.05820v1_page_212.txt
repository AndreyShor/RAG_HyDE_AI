upcoming experiments from the EIC which are predicted to definitely shed light on the
proton spin puzzle.
By addressing both the theoretical challenges and practical applications of PDFs, this research
strengthens our knowledge of the proton behavior during high energy collisions. Hopefully, our
contribution could pave the way for a more precise interpretation of complex experimental mea-
surements, ultimately giving us a better understanding of the interaction between elementary
particles.
