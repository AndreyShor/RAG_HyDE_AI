FIG. 7. From top to bottom we show the correlators defined
in Eq. (50) for i = 1, . . . , 5. The data have been obtained
from the B64 ensemble and correspond to the dominating
contribution ¯cs at spatial momentum (mDsω)2 = 0.43 GeV2,
or equivalently |ω| = 0.33.
The red points correspond to
the separation tsnk −tsrc = 56a ≃4.5 fm while the light-
blue points to tsnk −tsrc = 48a ≃3.9 fm.
The solid ver-
tical lines mark the points corresponding to the condition
tsnk −t = 0 −tsrc = 12a ≃1 fm, i.e. to the values of t
(t = 32a red dataset and t = 24a blue dataset) such that the
two separations between each interpolating operator and the
closer current are equal. The vertical dashed and solid black
lines correspond, respectively, to tsrc and to the position of
the current that we kept fixed.
extracted the information needed to compute the cor-
relators Cµν(tsnk, t, tsrc, ω2) in the interesting region of
the parameter space, i.e. for values of tsrc and tsnk such
that the systematic errors associated with the asymp-
totic limits T 7→∞, tsrc 7→−∞and tsnk 7→∞can
be kept under control.
An example of this analysis is
shown in Figure 7.
The figure shows the five ampu-
tated correlators ˆY(i)
¯cs (t, ω2) extracted on the B64 ensem-
ble from the quark-connected contraction of the correla-
tor Cµν
¯cs (tsnk, t, tsrc, ω2) (see Figure 2) for two different
values of the separation tsnk −tsrc between the inter-
polating operators and for (mDsω)2 = 0.43 GeV2. In
both cases we set tsrc = −12a ≃−1 fm while we set
tsnk = 36a ≃2.9 fm in the case of the light-blue points
and tsnk = 44a ≃3.5 fm in the case of the red points.
The solid vertical lines mark the points corresponding to
the condition tsnk −t = 0 −tsrc = 12a, i.e. the values
of t (t = 32a red dataset and t = 24a light-blue dataset)
such that the two separations between each interpolating
operator and the closer current are equal. As it can be
seen, the light-blue and red datasets are fully compat-
ible within the statistical errors up to values of t such
that tsnk −t = a. The separation 0 −tsrc between the
interpolating operator of the initial state and the first
weak current has been fixed at ≃1 fm, a distance of
the same order of the time separation where the plateau
of the effective mass of the correlator C(t) sets in (see
Figure 6). Then, by relying on the symmetries of our
four-points correlator, we studied the dependence of our
results upon tsrc and tsnk by varying the distance tsnk −t
between P(xsnk) and the weak current inserted at time
t. From this analysis, that we repeated for all consid-
ered values of the momenta ω (see following sections)
and also for the other flavor channels, we concluded that
the systematic errors associated with the tsrc 7→−∞and
tsnk 7→∞limits are negligible with respect to the sta-
tistical errors of our correlators.
Our estimates of the
systematic errors associated with finite size effects, i.e.
with the T 7→∞and L 7→∞limits, will be discussed in
details in the following sections.
In order to extract the decay rate and the lepton-energy
moments we used the data corresponding to the larger
separation, i.e. to tsnk −tsrc ≃4.5 fm, that we kept fixed
in physical units on the different gauge ensembles. With
this choice the systematics associated with the asymp-
totic limits can safely be neglected w.r.t the statistical
errors and, moreover, we can use larger values of N to
reconstruct the smearing kernels according to Eq. (35)
and, hence, to study the systematics associated with the
N 7→∞limits (see section VII).
