SO(1, 3). Note in addition, that in this case the rep 4 is decomposed under SU(2)×SU(2) ∼
SO(1, 3) in the appropriate reps to describe the two Weyl spinors.
One can follow also another way to break SU(4) to SU(2) × SU(2), along the lines
discussed in Section 4.1, i.e. in order to break the SU(4) gauge group to SU(2) × SU(2)
we can use scalars in the adjoint rep of SU(4), 15, which is contained in the adjoint rep of
SO(18), 153. In that case we have:
SU(4) ⊃SU(2) × SU(2) × U(1)
4 = (2, 1)(1) + (1, 2)(−1)
15 = (1, 1)(0) + (2, 2)(2) + (2, 2)(−2) + (3, 1)(0) + (1, 3)(0) .
(119)
Then, by giving vev in the <1, 1> direction of the adjoint rep, 15 we obtain the known
result [72], that SU(4) breaks spontaneously to SU(2) × SU(2) × U(1). The way to vanish
the corresponding U(1) gauge boson and remain with the SU(2) × SU(2) was discussed
already in Section 4.1.
Note again that the 4 is decomposed in the appropriate reps of
SU(2) × SU(2) ∼SO(1, 3) able to describe the two Weyl spinors.
Having established the analysis of the various breakings using the branching rules under
the maximal subgroups starting from the group SO(18), one can easily consider instead the
isomorphic algebras of the various groups. Specifically, instead of SO(18), the isomorphic
algebra of the non-compact groups SO(2, 16) ∼SO(18), and similarly SO(2, 4) ∼SO(6) ∼
SU(4).

Weyl and Majorana conditions on Fermions
Having examined the various SSB in Section 4.1 and above, let us next discuss further the
fermions and the result of Weyl and Majorana conditions when they are imposed on them.
A Dirac spinor, ψ has 2
D
2 independent components in D dimensions. Then the Weyl and
Majorana conditions, when imposed, each divide the number of independent components by
2. The Weyl constraint can be imposed only for even D, therefore the Weyl–Majorana spinor,
resulting after the imposition of both Weyl and Majorana conditions to a Dirac spinor, has
2
D−4
2
independent components (for even D).
The unitary reps of the Lorentz group SO(1, D−1) are labeled by a continuous momentum
vector k, and by a spin ‘projection’, which in D dimensions is a rep of the compact subgroup
SO(D −2). The Dirac, Weyl, Majorana, and Weyl–Majorana spinors carry indices that
transform as finite-dimensional non-unitary spinor reps of SO(1, D −1). It is also known
[81, 82], that the type of spinors one obtains for SO(p, q) in the real case is governed by the
signature (p−q) mod 8. Among even signatures, signature zero gives a real rep, signature four
a quaternionic rep, while signatures two and six give complex reps. In the case of SO(2, 16)
the signature is six, and imposing the Majorana condition in addition to Weyl is permitted.
For completeness and fixing the notation let us recall, the well-known case of 4 dimensions,
which were discussed only briefly earlier in the present section.
The SO(1, 3) spinors in
the usual SU(2) × SU(2) basis transform as (2, 1) and (1, 2), with reps labelled by their
dimensionality. The two-component Weyl spinors, ψL and ψR, transform as the irreducible
spinors, ψL ∼(2, 1) and ψR ∼(1, 2) of SU(2) × SU(2) with ‘∼’ here meaning ‘transforms
as’. Then a Dirac spinor, ψ, is made from the direct sum of ψL and ψR, ψ ∼(2, 1) ⊕(1, 2).
