the mean momentum, and 1 for the spatial standard deviation of the wavepacket at t = 0. Hence, for S + 1
species, we have 7(S + 1) free parameters to specify which we define as the reaction geometry. The reaction
geometry is user-specified and based on the kinematic scenario desired for simulation. While in principle any
configuration is acceptable, certain desiderata exist to bolster a combination of physical realism, scientific
utility, and algorithmic efficiency, as discussed in Sec. 2.2.

Approximate molecular Hamiltonian for initial state preparation
We invoke a standard series of approximations in molecular physics literature [72, 73, 74]:
• Born-Oppenheimer approximation (Sec. 4.2.1),
• Rigid-rotor approximation (Sec. 4.2.2),
• Harmonic oscillator approximation (Sec. 4.2.3).
4.2.1
Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation
We assume that the degrees of freedom of the molecules are well-described by the Born-Oppenheimer (BO)
approximation at t = 0. This means separating the electronic and nuclear Schrödinger equations as per
the standard procedure.13
We solve for the electronic ground state with parametric dependence on the
nuclear positions to construct the ground state potential energy surface (PES). Specifically, we start with
the operator Hs in Eq. (44), drop the nuclear kinetic term and fix nuclear positions for species s
Rs = {RI}I∈Is,
(48)
obtaining the operator

We now introduce the pseudopotential approximation [60]. That is, we remove some of the electron DoF (non-
valence) and replace the Coulomb potential felt by the electrons due to the fixed nuclei with a pseudopotential:

species s, with |Es| = ηs

PP,s(RI) is defined as in Eq. (5), just restricted to species s:

PP,NL(RI) given in Eq. (6) and Eq. (7), respectively.
The Hamiltonian HPP,s
BO
is, in
essence, the BO version of the pseudoion Hamiltonian of Eq. (3) for a single molecular species.
We then consider the eigenproblem for HPP,s
BO (Rs) for fixed nuclear coordinates. We make the assumption
that the electronic degrees of freedom are in the ground state as discussed in Sec. 2.2. Let Es(Rs) be an
approximation to the ground state PES, i.e., the ground state energy of HPP,s
BO (Rs) as a function of Rs.
The corresponding ground state for species s and fixed nuclear coordinates Rs is denoted by |gel
s (Rs)⟩. The
nuclei then obey a Hamiltonian describing particles experiencing a potential given by the PES,

13The BO approximation, as per usual, entails the adiabatic approximation, where potential energy surfaces (PES) of all
electronic energy manifolds are mutually well-separated such that the non-adiabatic coupling terms between PES are ignored;
and it entails neglecting the diagonal correction, such that the Hamiltonian simply reduces to kinetic terms with the ground
state PES as an effective potential. See Sec. 3.1 in Ref. [70] for details.
