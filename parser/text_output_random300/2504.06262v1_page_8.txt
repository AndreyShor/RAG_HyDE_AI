This ambiguity in the dimensionality of the system will
be addressed in Section III. A complete mapping to a 3D
GPE will be achieved once the finite spectral linewidth
of the laser is taken into account and the field is properly
renormalized (see Section III).
For the sake of simplicity, we will for now satisfy our-
selves with this “partial” mapping, as it is sufficient to
understand most of the phenomena studied up to now in
fluids of light, as we will see in Section III.
The mapping in Eq. (32) is useful to explain the math-
ematical mapping, however, when working with fluids of
light, we rather keep the native units of the original NLSE
given by Eq. (28). This is equivalent to ignoring the ℏand
c factors in all analogous terms. The analogous kinetic
and interaction energy terms are then expressed in m−1
and generally, the interaction coefficient g = −k0nE
2 /n0
which appears in Eq. (28) is preferred over the effective
one ¯g = ℏcg. The analogous interaction energy is then
given by −k0∆n with:
∆n = nE

In Table 1, we compare the optical NLSE and the GPE
formalism in the 2D+1 geometry.

The natural experimental units to express the energies are

the expressions in the table by ℏ).
D. Hydrodynamics equation
To understand the denomination of “fluid” of light, it
useful to move to an hydrodynamics framework.
This
can be done through the Madelung transform, where the
field envelope E is expressed as a function of its density

simulation by (Pomeau and Rica, 1993). c) A fluid of light
(no interaction) hitting a defect at high velocity (faster than

Injecting this expression in Eq. (28), we obtain, similarly
as for a classical fluids, a set of Euler equations:

∇⊥ϕ is the velocity of the fluid. Eq. (35)
is a continuity equation that describes the dissipation of
the photon density due to absorption. Eq. (36) is a con-
vection equation coupling the velocity flow to different
source terms on the right-hand side. From left to right,
these terms represent: a potential term, an interaction
term, and a term analogous to the Bohm quantum po-
tential, commonly referred to as the quantum pressure.
The term has no counterpart in classical fluids, and be-
comes dominant in case of rapid density fluctuations in
the transverse plane. While (Tsang and Psaltis, 2005)
have interpreted the quantum pressure term to play anal-
ogous roles to viscosity in the Navier-Stokes equations,
the similarity between quantum pressure and viscosity is
still an open problem.
