Finding examples with conifold transitions
To obtain the nodal quintics X1, X2 and the nodal octics X3, X4, we use conifold transitions
from smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds b
Xr
a for a = 1, . . . , 4, following the strategy laid out in [16].
In all of these cases b
Xr
a is a complete intersection in a product of projective spaces (so-called
CICYs, introduced in [43, 44]).

We always proceed in the following three steps:
1. We start with a smooth Calabi-Yau 3-fold b
Xr
a, with the homology group of curves being
H2( b
Xr
a, Z) ≃Zm × B( b
Xr
a) ,
(2.5)
where B( b
Xr
a) = Tors H2( b
Xr
a, Z) is some ﬁnite Abelian group. We conjecture that B( b
Xr
a)
is trivial in all of our examples. To simplify the exposition we will make this assumption
in the rest of the paper. However, our results do not rely on this conjecture. If B( b
Xr
a)
should be non-trivial, the only consequence would be that statements about the torsion
of curves should be interpreted in the homology modulo B( b
Xr
a).
2. We then show that b
Xr
a is a small resolution of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold Xr
a that has isolated
nodal singularities Sr
a ⊂Xr
a, that fall into two sets
Sr
a = Sr,A
a
∪Sr,B
a
.

We refer to the corresponding nodes as being of Type A and Type B. We will denote
the exceptional curve in b
Xr
a that resolves the node p ∈Sr
a by Cp ⊂b
Xr
a. In all of our
examples, the nodal Calabi-Yau Xr
a admits a smooth deformation e
Xa.
3. We show that Xr
a also admits a partial smoothing Xa that preserves the subset Sr,A
a
⊂Sr
a
of the nodes. Using a Mayer-Vietoris argument, analogous to the one used in the proof
