SINGULARITY AND REGULARITY OF THE CRITICAL 2D SHF

Proof. It is enough to prove (3.1) when Ψpxq “ Opxq grows at most linearly as x Ñ 8,
since the general case follows by monotone convergence. We may also assume that φ is
continuous and compactly supported, because such functions are dense in L1.
By the weak convergence (1.20), it is enough to prove (3.1) when the SHF Z ϑ
t is replaced
by the rescaled directed polymer partition function Zβcrit

tN , because the limit N Ñ 8 is
justified by uniform integrability (via boundedness in L2). More generally, we claim that

Relation (3.3) is known to hold by the FKG inequality, see e.g. the proofs of [Com17,
Proposition 3.1] or [CSZ17, Theorem 2.8] where the arguments are carried out for fractional
moments, but they hold in general.

3.1. Singularity of the SHF. We now prove Theorem 1.1 on the singularity of the
SHF. Let us first recall some general facts about measures on the Euclidean space.
By the Lebesgue Decomposition Theorem [Fol99, Theorem 3.8], any σ-finite measure ν
on R2 is the sum ν “ νac ` νsing of an absolutely continuous part νacpdxq “ fpxq dx and a
singular part νsingpdxq K dx which assigns all its mass to a set of zero Lebesgue measure.
If furthermore ν is locally finite, then the density fpxq of νac can be computed as follows:
denoting by Bpx, δq :“ ty P R2 : |y ´ x| ă δu the Euclidean ball in R2, we have

for Lebesgue a.e. x P R2 ,
(3.4)
see [Fol99, Theorem 3.22] (any locally finite measure is regular by [Fol99, Theorem 7.8]).
In particular, we summarise the following general result.
Proposition 3.2 (Singularity of measures). Given a locally finite measure ν on R2, the
limit in (3.4) exists for Lebesgue a.e. x P R2 and recovers the density fpxq of the absolutely
continuous part of ν. In particular, ν is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure if and
only if the limit in (3.4) vanishes for Lebesgue a.e. x P R2.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Applying Proposition 3.2 to the SHF νpdxq “ Z ϑ
t pdxq, we see
that if (1.10) holds, then almost surely the SHF is singular with respect to Lebesgue.
It remains to prove (1.10), which we deduce from (1.12). We denote by pΩ, A, Pq the
probability space on which the SHF is defined and we indicate explicitly the dependence on
ω P Ωby Z ϑ,ω
t
pdxq. Recalling (1.9), we rephrase (1.10) as
for a.e. ω P Ω:

where we have fixed (arbitrarily) δn :“ 1
n and we have replaced lim by lim inf, in order to
obtain a measurable function Lpω, xq P r0, 8s defined for all ω P Ωand x P R2. We stress
that the limit in (1.10) exists as δ Ó 0 for Lebesgue a.e. x P R2, see Proposition 3.2, hence it
must coincide with Lpω, xq for a.e. ω P Ωand for Lebesgue a.e. x P R2.
To complete the proof, we need to show that, for a.e. ω P Ω, we have Lpω, xq “ 0 for
Lebesgue a.e. x P R2, or equivalently Er

R2 Lpω, xqα dxs “ 0 for any fixed α P p0, 1q (recall
that Lpω, xq ě 0). By Fubini’s theorem, it is enough to show that for all x P R2 we have
