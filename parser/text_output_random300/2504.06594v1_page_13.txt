Figure 4: Extrapolation results (black circles) for rms point radii rp, rm and rn in the 6He
ground state with increasing training data sets including the NCSM results obtained with

red diamonds present TTE extrapolations [33].
6He nucleus, as seen in Table 2, is much smaller than its point-neutron ra-
dius rn revealing the two-neutron halo structure of this nucleus. The rms
point-nucleon radius rm lies between these two values satisfying with a good
accuracy the well-known relation

A comparison of predicted rms point radii with the experimental data
and the results of the phenomenological 2D TTE extrapolation [32, 33] is
presented in Table 2. Notably, our 6He results agree with the experiment for
radii while the predicted 6He ground state energy (see Table 1) lies slightly
below the experimental value.
