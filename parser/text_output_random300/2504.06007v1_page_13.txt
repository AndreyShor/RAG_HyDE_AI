CAMulator
Figure 9: Time series of Global average Surface Temperature (a) and Column-integrated heat content (b,c) for
simulations driven by different sea surface temperature (SST) climatologies: 2000 SST climatology (dark blue),
2000+2K (brown), and 2000+4K (green). The results from CAM6 (dashed lines) and CAMulator (solid lines) are
shown. Integrated heat content is shown in two layers: (b) 850–1000 hPa and (c) 200–850 hPa.
upper troposphere (200–850 hPa; Fig. 9c). To assess the model’s extrapolation capabilities under out-of-distribution
forcing, we introduce uniform SST anomalies of +2K and +4K across all ocean grid cells and compare the CAMulator’s
response to that of CAM6. Notably, these warming states lie well beyond the training data, testing the model’s ability to
generalize under extreme forcing scenarios.
The surface temperature response in the lowest model level exhibits the strongest agreement with CAM6, particularly in
the year 2000 climatology +0K and +2K cases, where the seasonal cycles are well-aligned. However, discrepancies
emerge under stronger warming, with a systematic cold bias in the CAMulator during boreal winter in both the +2K and
+4K simulations. This bias suggests that CAMulator fails to fully capture key feedback mechanisms governing seasonal
temperature variations in high-latitude regions. As shown in Figure 10, the largest errors in 2-meter temperature occur
in polar and sea-ice-dominated regions, indicating that the CAMulator lacks a robust representation of ice-atmosphere
interactions. Specifically, the model has no explicit knowledge of sea-ice melt dynamics, surface albedo feedbacks, or
key phase transition processes that modulate energy exchange in these environments. In contrast, CAM6 dynamically
represents the retreat and expansion of ice cover, which strongly regulates the surface energy budget in these regions.
The absence of such processes in the CAMulator likely leads to an unrealistic seasonal persistence of cold anomalies
during boreal winter.
