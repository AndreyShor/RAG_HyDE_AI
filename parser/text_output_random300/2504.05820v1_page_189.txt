Appendix B.
Comparison with MSHT20aN3LO
In this appendix, we compare the NNPDF4.0 aN3LO PDF set to the only other existing aN3LO
PDF set, MSHT20 aN3LO [303]. As already discussed in Section 4.1.7, MSHT20 aN3LO PDFs
are determined by fitting to the data the nuisance parameters that parametrize the IHOU
uncertainty on a prior approximation to splitting functions. It follows that the ensuing central
value is partly determined by the data, and the IHOU is entirely data-driven. When comparing
NNPDF4.0 and MSHT20 aN3LO PDF sets it should of course be borne in mind that the sets
already differ at NNLO due to differences in dataset and methodology. The NNLO MSHT20
and NNPDF4.0 PDF sets were compared in Fig. 21 and the corresponding parton luminosity in
Fig. 60 of Ref. [109], while a detailed benchmarking was presented in Ref. [377].
The comparison of the aN3LO sets is presented in Fig. B.1, where we show the NNPDF4.0
no MHOU set and the MSHT20 set recommended as baseline in Ref. [303] at Q = 100 GeV,
normalized to the NNPDF4.0 central value. All error bands are one sigma uncertainties. The
dominant differences between the PDF sets are the same as already observed at NNLO, with
the largest difference observed for the charm PDF, which is independently parametrized in
NNPDF4.0, but not in MSHT20, where it is determined by perturbative matching conditions.
However, the differences, while remaining qualitatively similar, are slightly reduced (by 1−2 %)
when moving from NNLO to aN3LO. Exceptions are the charm and especially the gluon PDF,
which differ more at aN3LO. Specifically, the gluon PDF, while reasonably compatible for
x ≲0.07 at NNLO, disagrees at aN3LO, with the MSHT20 result suppressed by 3 −4 % in the
region 10−3 ≲x ≲10−1, with a PDF uncertainty of 1 −2 %. This suppression of the MSHT20
gluon can likely be traced to the behavior of the Pgq splitting function seen in Fig. 4.8.
Parton luminosities are compared in Fig. B.2. Again the pattern is similar to that seen at NNLO,
but now with a considerable suppression of the gluon-gluon and gluon-quark luminosities in the
MX ∼100 GeV region that can be traced to the behavior of the gluon PDF seen in Fig. B.1. The
quark-quark luminosity remains similar in MSHT20 and NNPDF4.0 both at NNLO and aN3LO.
The impact of these effects on the computation of precision LHC cross-sections is addressed in
Section 4.4.
In order to understand better the comparative impact of aN3LO corrections, we compare for
each set the NNLO and aN3LO luminosities. Results are shown in Fig. B.3, normalized to the
aN3LO result. The qualitative impact of the aN3LO corrections on either set is similar, but with
a stronger aN3LO suppression of gluon luminosities for MSHT20. In particular the gluon-gluon
luminosity is suppressed for 102 ≲mX ≲103 GeV by about 3 % in NNPDF4.0 and 6 % in
MSHT20 and the gluon-quark luminosity is suppressed in the same region by about 1 % in
