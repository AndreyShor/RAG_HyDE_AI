SINGULARITY AND REGULARITY OF THE CRITICAL 2D SHF

To complete the proof of our goal (4.2), we are going to show that, for M “ MN Ñ 8
slowly enough, the following three convergences in distribution hold:

(4.14)
with σ2 as in (4.2). Intuitively, these relations hold because the random variables ∆N,i are
approximately independent, due to the separation of time scales (4.5). The proof of (4.2)
then follows by first choosing M “ MN Ñ 8 slowly enough such that (4.3) still holds, and
then applying the identity (4.10).
The rest of the proof is divided into the following steps:
‚ in Steps 1 and 2 we define Zoff
N and Zdiff
N
and prove the two limits in (4.3);
‚ in Step 3 we give a convenient representation for the ratio Zdiff
N,i{Zdiff
N,i´1 as a partition
function on the time interval pNi´1, Nis with initial condition given by a polymer
distribution at time Ni´1, and we show that the latter is close to the free random walk
thanks to the fact that noise has been turned off in the time interval p ˜Ni, Nis.
‚ in Steps 4 and 5 we compute the variance of ∆N,i and bound its higher moments;
‚ in Step 6 we prove (4.12) through the martingale CLT;
‚ in Step 7 we prove relations (4.13) and (4.14) by variance bounds.
4.1. Step 1: switching off the noise. The first approximation Zoff
N of the partition
function Zav
N , recall (4.1), is obtained by “switching off the noise” in the time strips p ˜Ni, Nis
for 1 ď i ď M, see (4.5) and (4.6): this will ensure that the endpoint distribution of the
polymer at time Ni is comparable to the random walk transition kernel. Recalling (2.1) and
(1.18), we thus define

In this step, we prove the first relation in (4.3):

Let G be the σ-algebra generated by the disorder variables that have not been swithced
off, namely G :“ σ
