Generalized moments
We extend the integral equation (2) by introducing a more general source term:
χα(θ) −
Z b
−b
K(θ −θ′)χα(θ′)dθ′ = cosh(αx),
|θ| ≤b,
(26)
where α ≥0 is a real parameter and 1/K(θ) = θ2 +π2. In particular, α = 0 recovers the original
integral equation if we set
b = πB,
f(x) = 2χ0(πx).
(27)
We can now consider the densities
Oα,β ≡1
2π
Z b
−b
cosh(βθ)χα(θ)dθ,
(28)
with β ≥0, which are symmetric in α and β. In the α = β = 0 case, we recover the density
ϕ0 = 4O0,0. For generic parameters, Oα,β can be used to generate the generalized moments of
the solution χα(θ):
ϕα;ℓ=

(29)
For α = 0 they are the usual moments ϕℓ= ϕ0;ℓ. It will also be useful to consider the values of
χα(θ) at the boundaries of the integration range, which we denote as
χα ≡χα(±b).
(30)
From now on, we use a dot to denote the total derivative with respect to b.
Straightforward manipulations (see Appendix A of [21] for the detailed derivations) lead to
the ODEs relating the Oα,β-s and χα-s:
˙Oα,β = 1
πχαχβ
(31)
¨Oα,β −2 ˙χα
χα
˙Oα,β + (α2 −β2)Oα,β = 0
(32)
π(α2 −β2)Oα,β = ˙χαχβ −χα ˙χβ
(33)
¨χα
χα
−α2 = F.
(34)
In the last line, F ≡¨χ0/χ0 is an universal, α-independent function of b.
Not all of these
equations are independent: the second-order differential equations (32), (34) can be derived
from the first-order ones (31), (33).
From (32), we may obtain an expression relating the moment ϕℓwith the previous moment
ϕℓ−1. Taking 2ℓderivatives with respect to β in (32), then evaluating at α = β = 0 and using
the relation (29), we arrive at [7]
¨ϕℓ−
¨ϕ0
˙ϕ0
˙ϕℓ= 2ℓ(2ℓ−1)ϕℓ−1
π2 ,
(35)
where we used (31) to rewrite 2 ˙χ0/χ0 = ¨ϕ0/ ˙ϕ0. This equation can be used recursively to compute
ϕℓfrom ϕℓ−1, with initial condition given by ϕ0.
The generalized moments ϕα;ℓin (29) may be obtained directly from the moments at α = 0.
Indeed, if we take 2ℓderivatives with respect to β in (31), both at generic α and at α = 0, we
can then combine both equations into the relation
˙ϕα;ℓ= χα
χ0
˙ϕℓ.
