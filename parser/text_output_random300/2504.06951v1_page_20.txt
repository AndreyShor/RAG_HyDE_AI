type, since the terms in the general model have a varying sizes C(J, N); see [25][pp. 398-399], [26][Section
3.1.4] for the original idea and [3] for an exhaustive treatment of reduced GLT matrix-sequences: it is clear
that such a more precise result would provide a substantial improvement with respect to Theorem 2.
Finally, it would be desirable to explore GLT theory in connection with locally interacting quantum spin
models, such as the quantum Ising or quantum Heisenberg models, which represent realistic interacting sys-
tems commonly found in condensed matter physics. Progress in this direction would significantly contribute
to our understanding of the fundamental structure of matter.
