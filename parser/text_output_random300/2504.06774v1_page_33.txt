leads to extremely high relative errors. In such a case, RRMSE is not a good way to
evaluate the model; rather, the focus should be on the UQ curves presented below. While
differences between LSTM architectures remain small, the 2 dense model achieves the
best performance for the HOSVD approach, followed by the time-distributed architecture.
Despite the advantages of HOSVD, achieving high accuracy in this component remains a
challenge due to the inherent complexity of three-dimensional flow dynamics.
