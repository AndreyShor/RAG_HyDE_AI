Figure 3: Validation of the 2D image registration approach in a 3D synthetic porous medium. (left) The initial 3D sphere
pack porous medium. (middle) A known 2D plane selected as the ground truth (template) for the image registration
(green). (right) The registered 2D image after image registration (blue), overlaid with the ground truth for validation.
