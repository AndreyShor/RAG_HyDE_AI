FIG. 4. Collective-mode scenario. Side-by-side comparison of the Raman response of a two-band nodeless anisotropic
s-wave superconductor when accounting for many-body effects in scenarios where a Bardasis–Schrieffer phase collective mode
is present. These manifest as sharp features in response functions. Panels (a) correspond to a situation where we do not have
any sharp collective modes as is evidenced by the large-N plots, while the panels (b) correspond to a situation where we do
have a sharp collective mode. As is evident, in the low-N scenario it is difficult to disentangle spurious peaks from peaks due
to collective modes in the RSum prescriptions – (a1) and (b1), but is more readily done in mRes prescription – (a2) and (b2).
The shaded regions represents the spread of anisotropy of the order parameters.
the Fe-based pnictides and chalcogenides [40, 41], where
the structure of the order parameter may take the form
∆θ = ∆0 +∆1 cos 4θ. This order-parameter structure al-
lows for two scenarios: (i) ∆1 > ∆0, which is referred to
as the nodal case where the order parameter reaches zero
at certain angles; and (ii) ∆1 < ∆0, which is referred to
as the nodeless case, as the order parameter is finite for
all angles, but is anisotropic. These are referred to as the
anisotropic s-wave order parameters. The form of I(ω, θ)
and s(ω, θ) associated with them remain the same as be-
fore, but with the use of the appropriate ∆θ. In Fig. 2, we
show the comparison of the RSum and the mRes meth-
ods for different choices of C ∈{A1g, B1g, B2g}, which
changes the number and the location of the singular fea-
tures. The panels (a) correspond to the nodal order pa-
rameter and the panels (b) to the nodeless one.
In Fig. 3, we present the scenario from Fig. 2(b1) but
comparing the RSum and the mRes prescription for dif-
ferent values of N. The faster convergence of the residue
prescription is evident.

Collective modes
Owing to the potential high cost of increasing the num-
ber of sub-intervals, it is beneficial to keep this number
low. However, as we saw in Fig. 3, we run into the risk of
introducing spurious peaks in the response that will mis-
guide the inference drawn from the calculation. We can
demonstrate this issue by performing a calculation for
a simple model that calculates the full Raman response
with many-body interactions using the prescriptions out-
lined in Refs. [37, 42–45].
The relevant detail for the present work is that al-
though we need the same steps to calculate χC as before,
this is then followed by many recursive steps that ef-
fectively realize the many-body renormalizations. These
steps involve inverting matrices of rank of the order of
the mesh size. The numerical cost for such a calculation
can scale uncomfortably quickly with N. In fact, this is
one of the reasons why there are few studies exploring
the Raman response from arbitrarily anisotropic super-
conductors [46].
In Fig. 4, we compare the results for the full Ra-
man response computed with the RSum and the mRes
prescriptions for different N in the presence of col-
lective modes, resulting in the presence of sharp and
broad features in the converged result. The sharp one
is a coherent Bardasis–Schrieffer collective mode [47]
of the system which provides crucial insight into the
electronic properties of the material – in this case, on
the strength of sub-leading competing pairing symmetry
channels [42, 43, 47, 48] – and is induced by many-body
interactions. As is evident from the panels of the figure,
for a low N, the distinction between the collective-mode
feature and the spurious ones is not clear. Importantly, a
clear distinction is achieved faster when using the mRes
prescription [49]

Density of states
We can provide a further example of a response func-
tion where the improvement of the results using the mRes
method can also be demonstrated. Let us consider the
calculation of the density of states of a superconductor
with an anisotropic order parameter ∆θ [50]. The den-
sity of states per unit area of such a 2D superconductor
