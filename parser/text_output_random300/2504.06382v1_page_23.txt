CG theory which has an Einstein sector in six dimensions. This functional gives rise to a
renormalized holographic entanglement entropy for a wide variety of surfaces.
The action of Einstein-AdS gravity is on-shell proportional to the volume of the space-
time. The removal of infinities, coming from the conformal boundary of AAdS spaces,
leading to the notion of Renormalized Volume, has been linked to conformal invariants in
mathematical literature [77, 78]. The results shown here are a manifestation of the fact
Renormalized Volume induces Renormalized Area, and other closely related finite func-
tionals in codimension-2.

Notation and Conventions
This section outlines the notation and conventions used throughout this work. The bulk
manifold M is a spacetime equipped with the metric gµν, whose boundary is ∂M. The
surface Σ lives in codimension–2, and it is embedded in M by two normal vectors. Its
boundary is given by ∂Σ. Table 1 summarizes the notation used.

Table 1. Notation for the spacetime and corresponding submanifolds
The embedding of Σ in M is given by the functions Xµ = Xµ (Y a), where Xµ are the
coordinates of the bulk and Y a are the intrinsic coordinates on Σ. The induced metric on
Σ is constructed by the pullback of the bulk metric,
γab = eµ
aeν
bgµν
(A.1)
where eµ
a = ∂aXµ forms a basis of the tangent space of Σ. The normal bundle of the surface
is described by the orthonormal vectors nµ
A, which are also orthogonal to each other. The
metric of the normal bundle is defined as,
δAB = nµ
