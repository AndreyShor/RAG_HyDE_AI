Figure 3. SINS nanospectroscopic analysis of a 100 nm thick suspended SrTiO3 membrane. 
a) Near-field optical image of the suspended (orange) and supported (yellow) membrane. The 
green dashed line indicates the SINS line scan direction. The sharp, perpendicular, membrane edge 
is used as the x=0 μm reference in plots (a-e). b) SINS spectra acquired at various distances from 
the sample edge. Green (solid) spectra is a SINS spectrum taken far away from sample edge, green 
(dashed) spectra is a SINS spectrum simulated by finite dipole modeling. c) SINS amplitude 
spectra (=+()) obtained by a line scan perpendicular to the edge of the membrane, showing SPhP 
fringes in RB2 and RB3. d) Fourier transform spectra of a SINS spectrum at 355 cm-1 (top) and at 
all frequencies in RB2 (bottom), showing the line profiles are dominated by two spatial frequencies 
corresponding to kp and 2kp. In the bottom panel, white dashed lines correspond to analytically 
calculated dispersion of 100 nm in Fig.1d and blue horizontal line marks the line cut at ω = 355cm-
1, corresponding to the spectrum in the top panel. e) SINS amplitude (=+()) line profiles (symbol) 
at different frequencies in RB2. The green curves are the fit of the experimental data with the
