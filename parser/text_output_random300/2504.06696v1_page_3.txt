To this end, we adopt the displacement-transformation
method to separate the semiclassical motion and quan-
tum fluctuations [55]. Concretely, we make the displace-
ment transformation to quantum master equation (2) by
introducing the density matrix ˆρd in the displaced repre-
sentation as [45, 55, 56]
ˆρd = ˆDa(α) ˆDb(β)ˆρ ˆD†
a(α) ˆD†
b(β),
(3)
where ˆDa(α) = exp(αˆa† −α∗ˆa) and ˆDb(β) = exp(βˆb† −
β∗ˆb) are, respectively, the displacement operators of
modes a and b, with the time-dependent displacement
amplitudes α(t) and β(t). In the displacement represen-
tation, the quantum master equation (2) becomes
˙ˆρd = −i[ ˆHd, ˆρd] + κa(N + 1) ˆD[ˆa]ˆρd + κaN ˆD[ˆa†]ˆρd
−κaM ˆG[ˆa]ˆρd −κaM ∗ˆG[ˆa†]ˆρd
+ κb(¯nth + 1) ˆD[ˆb]ˆρd + κb¯nth ˆD[ˆb†]ˆρd.

In the derivation of Eq. (4), we have eliminated the linear
term of the operators ˆa (ˆa†) and ˆb (ˆb†) by setting their
coefficients to be zero. In this way, we obtain the equa-
tions of motion of the displacement amplitudes α(t) and
β(t) as follows,

In this work, we focus on the steady-state properties of
the system, i.e., setting ˙α = 0 and ˙β = 0, then the steady-
state values of the displacement amplitudes αss and βss
can be obtained analytically.
In the steady-state case, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (4)
can be approximated as
ˆHd =∆dˆa†ˆa + ωmˆb†ˆb + χα2

Here, the normalized detuning ∆d and linearized opo-
tomechanical coupling strength Gd are defined by

In order to further eliminate the two-photon terms

squeezing transformation via [45]
ˆρsd = ˆS†
a(ξ)ˆρd ˆSa(ξ).
(8)
Here, ˆρsd is the density matrix of the system in the
squeezed representation,
and
ˆSa(ξ)

exp[(ξ∗ˆa2 −
ξˆa†2)/2] is the squeezing operator with ξ = r exp(iφ),
where r is the squeezing parameter and φ is the reference
phase for the squeezed field. In the squeezed representa-
tion, the quantum master equation is given by
˙ˆρsd = −i[ ˆHsd, ˆρsd]

where the Hamiltonian in the squeezed representation is
given by
ˆHsd =∆sdˆa†ˆa + ωmˆb†ˆb + Rˆa2 + R∗ˆa†2
+ (Gsdˆa† + G∗
sdˆa)(ˆb† + ˆb).
(10)
The parameters ∆sd, R, and Gsd in Eq. (10) are defined
by
∆sd =∆d cosh(2r) −2χ(α2

where αr and αi are, respectively, the real and imagine
parts of αss, i.e., αss = αr + iαi.
It follows from Eq. (11b) that the two-photon terms
can be eliminated by appropriately choosing the value of
r and φ. Setting R = 0 leads to
2χ[(α2

Thus, the two-photon terms (Rˆa2 + R∗ˆa†2) in Hamilto-
nian (10) can be completely eliminated by choosing the
values of r and φ given by Eqs. (13).
The parameters Nss and Mss in Eq. (9) are given by
Nss = sinh2 r cosh2 re + sinh2 re cosh2 r
+2 cos(φ−θe) sinh r cosh r sinh re cosh re, (14a)
Mss =(sinh re cosh r+ e−i(φ−θe) sinh r cosh re)
× (sinh re sinh r+ ei(φ−θe) cosh re cosh r).
(14b)
We point out that Nss and Mss are the effective param-
eters associated with the squeezed reservoir of the cavity
field, and we can see from Eqs. (14) that the parameters
