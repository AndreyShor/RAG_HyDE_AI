THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The magnetic configurations of ferromagnetic nanoislands
in ASI and their collective dynamics are governed by the

Here, the first term represents the precessional term, while
the second term represents the damping term. In this context,
γ is the electron gyromagnetic ratio, M is the magnetization,
Ms is the saturation magnetization, and α is a phenomenolog-
ical dimensionless magnetic damping parameter. This form
assumes that α ≪1, as is typically the case for systems of
practical interest. Typically, the effective field contributions
used in ASIs are1,
⃗Hef f = ⃗HEx + ⃗HAni + ⃗HBias + ⃗HD,

which includes exchange (HEx), intrinsic anisotropy origi-
nating from crystalline spin-orbit coupling or from material
structures such as layering, interfaces, or grain structures
(HAni), an applied external field (HBias), and nonlocal magne-
tostatic (e.g., dipolar) fields (HD). The LLG equation, Eq. (1),
subject to the effective field equation, Eq. (2), is generally a
system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. An-
alytical solutions are typically found in cases where the mag-
netostatic field is simplified, e.g., in the thin film limit where it
reduces to a local field29. Consequently, numerical techniques
are often required in order to solve the LLG equation. There
are semi-analytical models30,31 and numerical tools like mi-
cromagnetic simulations for solving the LLG equation in ASI
structure1, which we discuss in the following.

MICROMAGNETICS
The investigation of magnetization dynamics of ASIs
through micromagnetic simulations has unveiled a significant
revelation: the existence of effective magnetic monopoles
within ASIs induces notable alterations in the ferromag-
netic resonance spectrum32. Subsequent experimental anal-
yses have not only corroborated these findings but also
identified distinctive magnodynamic signatures, offering in-
sights into the underlying physics of ASIs and their potential
applications25,31. This underscores the indispensable role of
micromagnetic simulations as a vital tool for comprehending
and forecasting novel phenomena within ASIs, thereby ad-
vancing our understanding and exploration of these intriguing
materials1. Therefore, in the following, we present a brief
review of micromagnetic simulation techniques to simulate
magnetization dynamics in ASIs.
Classical electromagnetic theory postulates that the sponta-
neous magnetization is an intrinsic property of ferromagnetic
(FM) materials, which imparts a magnetic moment to even
the minutest volume of a material. Initially approached in a
somewhat empirical fashion, the concept of spontaneous mag-
netization found its first comprehensive explanation through
the pioneering work of Weiss, who introduced the molecular
field postulate. This postulate was later refined by Heisen-
berg, who, employing the principles of quantum mechanics,
replaced the notion of the molecular field with the concept of
exchange forces. According to Heisenberg’s theory, these ex-
change forces strive to align the spins of magnetic entities,
counteracted by the disruptive influence of thermal energy,
which tends to misalign them. Nonetheless, this theory lacks
explicit directionality regarding magnetization as it only relies
on neighboring spins being parallel33.
Observations under constant temperature, viewed through
microscopes, reveal a curious phenomenon: while magneti-
zation remains uniform, its orientation varies across different
regions, unless either a magnetic field is applied or the ma-
terial’s size falls below a critical threshold. This tendency
for ferromagnetic thin films to organize into domains, each
with uniform magnetization but differing orientations, points
towards the formation of a demagnetized state, as initially
postulated by Weiss. The domain theory advanced by Weiss
effectively rationalizes such observations, yet it becomes ap-
parent that the presence and dimensions of domains are sig-
nificantly influenced by anisotropy forces within magnetic
