Introduction
One of the aspects of M-theory that played a crucial role in the second superstring revolution
was discovering that the theory makes sense on manifolds with boundary [1]. Concretely, M-
theory compactified on an interval (the so-called Hoˇrava-Witten theory [2, 3]) is described by
10d N = 1 heterotic supergravity with gauge group E8 ×E8 at low energies, and provides the
bridge between M and heterotic string theories. The two E8 factors appear, in the M-theory
picture, because there is an E8 N = 1 gauge multiplet living in each boundary of the interval
(see [4, 5] for a more systematic study of the well-definiteness of M-theory and its quantum
theory on a manifold with and without boundary using this connection with E8 gauge theory,
and [6] for a more recent study of M-theory on unorientable manifolds.)
As was shown in [2, 3], the precise matter content of an M-theory boundary (also known
as the M-theory end-of-the-world brane, or M9 brane) is completely determined by supersym-
metry and anomaly inflow from the bulk. The anomaly inflow problem is, in fact, very much
over-constrained, and so the existence of a boundary condition is very non-trivial evidence
for the internal consistency of string/M-theory.
