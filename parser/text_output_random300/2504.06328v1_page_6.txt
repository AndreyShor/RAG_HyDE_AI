Theory: Entanglement-Induced Curvature and Be-
yond.. Beyond applications, a rich theoretical line
of inquiry centers on entanglement-induced curva-
ture in multi-qubit systems [10], exploring how
quantum correlations shape the manifold geome-
try in ways that do not exist in classical spaces.
Researchers are investigating how to exploit these
higher-dimensional curvatures for classification or
generative modeling.
Preliminary results suggest
that certain entangled manifolds may separate com-
plex data distributions more efficiently than classi-
cal manifolds, though rigorous proofs of advantage
remain an open challenge.

between the two , geometric quantum machine

is poised for further growth,
with
promising avenues in NLP (QNLP), reinforcement
learning,
robotics,
and beyond.
As quantum
hardware matures, one can expect new classes of
hybrid algorithms that combine manifold-based
feature extraction with quantum entanglement and
interference, leveraging the best of both worlds.
Next, we will delve deeper into how QML can be
reframed as an extension of classical GML under a
unified manifold perspective.
3. Quantum Machine Learning: A More Ex-
pressive Geometric Superset
Section Overview. In this section, we broaden
the geometric perspective into the quantum do-
main,
arguing that quantum machine learning
(QML) is not merely an extension of geometric ma-
chine learning (GML) but a superset of it.
We
show that QML preserves the foundational geomet-
ric principles introduced earlier for classical sys-
tems, yet leverages uniquely quantum phenomena ,
superposition, entanglement, and the induced cur-
vature of quantum state space , to achieve a richer,
more expressive learning paradigm. In other words,
every classical geometric model can be regarded as a
special (commuting or separable) case of a quantum
model, while quantum models inhabit a substan-
tially larger state space with representational and
computational capabilities unattainable in any clas-
sical manifold. We ground this claim in the mathe-
matics of quantum state space geometry, referenc-
ing key tools like the Fubini -Study metric, Bures
distance, quantum Fisher information, and the dy-
namics on unitary group manifolds. Through illus-
trative examples (e.g. variational quantum circuits
as trajectories on curved manifolds and entangle-
ment as a geometric warp of product spaces), we
reinforce the thesis that QML provides a strictly
more expressive framework built upon but going
beyond classical geometric foundations.
3.1. Geometric Structure of Quantum State Space
Classical geometric machine learning typically
operates on data manifolds or parameter spaces en-
dowed with a Riemannian metric (e.g. the Fisher
information metric for probabilistic models).
In
quantum machine learning, the analogous object is
the quantum state space, which for a system with
Hilbert space H is the set of density operators ρ
(positive, unit trace operators on H). In the special
case of pure states |ψ⟩∈H, this space reduces to
the complex projective Hilbert space CPN−1 (with
N = dim H), since physical states are rays |ψ⟩⟨ψ|
up to a global phase.
This quantum state space
is naturally endowed with a Riemannian metric
structure that generalizes classical manifold geom-
etry. The fundamental distance measure between
infinitesimally close quantum states is given by the
Fubini -Study (FS) metric for pure states and
the Bures metric for mixed states. The FS metric
defines the line element on the projective manifold
of pure states as:
ds2
FS = ⟨∂iψ | ∂jψ⟩dθidθj −⟨∂iψ | ψ⟩⟨ψ | ∂jψ⟩dθidθj ,
(4)
for a smoothly parametrized state |ψ(θ)⟩with co-
ordinates θ = (θ1, θ2, . . . ). Equivalently, the Fubini
-Study metric can be characterized as the invariant
distance between nearby quantum states, satisfy-
ing DFS(|ψ⟩, |ψ + dψ⟩)2 = 1 −|⟨ψ | ψ + dψ⟩|2. This
metric is the quantum analogue of a Fisher infor-
mation metric on a probability simplex; indeed, in
the special case where all states under considera-
tion commute (so that they are simultaneously di-
