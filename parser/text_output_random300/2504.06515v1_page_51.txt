In the N system, the centre of the plot in Figure 31 is a ﬁxed point surrounded by a
subregion of near-integrable curves. The annulus orbits are all contained within the large
triangle surrounding this region. The closed circles in this annulus region correspond to
quasi-periodic orbits about the periodic annuli with higher period, such as in Figure 20.
The boundary of the annulus region is a thin region of chaos, most prominent at the
corners, as shown in the lower right inset. These chaotic regions are conﬁned and not
simply connected.
The region beyond this is the pretzel region, which has circles bounding the quasi-
periodic near-integrable regions; these exhibit repeated self-similarity, as shown in the
upper-right inset. The two large circles observed just below the annulus region correspond
to the boomerang-shaped orbits (AB3) shown in Figure 27. The next set of circles will
be A2B3, and so on. Between these sets of circles, there are collections of crescents with
sequences AB3A2B3, AB3AB3A2B3, etc. Each circle is actually a continuum of possible
circles, whose diameter depends on the initial conditions. At the centre of this family of
circles is a dot corresponding to the periodic orbit in question.
