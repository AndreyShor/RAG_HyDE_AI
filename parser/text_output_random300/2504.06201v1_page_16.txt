Fig. 2. The relative accuracy of the classical (IP, SA, SD, TS, and SA–QBSolv) and quantum 
(QA–QBSolv, and HQA) solvers for given QUBO problems. HQA is the best solver for finding 
the highest-quality solution for all problem sizes. 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3. Solving time of the solvers for given QUBO problems. The solving time of (a) the 
classical and quantum solvers and (b) the classical solvers (SA, SD, and TS) for small QUBO 
problems. Quantum solvers do not scale in solving time as the problem size increases, which is a 
great advantage over classical counterparts.
