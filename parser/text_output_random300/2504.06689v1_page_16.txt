correct only unknown parts of the QCD results, for example the virtual part of a calculation,
which are then combined with exact real corrections. The latter procedure is generally preferred,
especially where a differential description is required.

Table 1: Available theory results for Higgs boson decay, adapted from Refs. [378,379].
In Table 1, we list the Standard Model Higgs boson decays, as well as the available theory
precision for each channel. Below we briefly summarise the key theoretical works contributing
to the known precision; for more detailed reviews we refer the reader to Refs. [6,378–380].
The H →bb and H →cc partial widths are known at NNLOQCD [381–385] including quark
mass effects. The N3LOQCD correction for the yt induced contribution, including the mass of the
bottom quark, was recently computed [386]. In the heavy top limit and neglecting the bottom
quark mass, results are known to order N4LOHTL [387] and fully differentially at N3LOHTL [309].
The NLOEW and O(ααs) mixed QCD-EW corrections were obtained in Refs. [388–393] (with
two-loop master integrals in Ref. [394]), these calculations also represent the state of the art for
H →τ +τ −and H →µ+µ−decays.
The H →WW and H →ZZ widths are known at NLOQCD [395–397] and NLOEW [398–
402].
Recently, also O(ααs) mixed QCD-EW corrections have been calculated [403].
The
H →gg decay is known at NNLOQCD [404, 405] including quark mass effects.
The correc-
tions in the heavy top limit are known at N4LOHTL [387, 406]. The NLOEW corrections were
computed in Refs. [407–412]. The H →γγ decay is known at NNLOQCD including the exact
mass dependence [413,414] and at N3LOHTL in the large mass approximation [415] the NLOEW
corrections are also known [388,412,416,417].
The H →Zγ decay is measured as part of the Dalitz decays H →ffγ, which receive
contributions from H →γ∗γ →ffγ, H →Z∗γ →ffγ and direct/non-resonant H →ffγ. The
relevance of each channel depends on the experimental cuts and reconstruction strategy. For the
loop-induced H →Zγ decay, NLOQCD results are known [418–420], the NLOEW corrections were
obtained very recently [421,422] and found to be small, and unable to explain the discrepancy
between theory predictions and experimental measurements. For direct H →ffγ results are
known at NLOQCD and NLOEW accuracy [423–428].
Significant effort has recently been invested in the description of hadronic Higgs decays
through both the H →bb and H →gg channels.
