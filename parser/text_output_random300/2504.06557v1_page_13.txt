Centrality is a feature that indicates the importance of a node in the network, 
and closeness centrality is calculated from the average distance to all other nodes 
connected to the node. The closeness centrality 𝑐𝑖 of node 𝑖 is expressed as in Eq (6), 
using the average distance 𝑙𝑖, the number of nodes 𝑛𝑐 connected to node 𝑖, and the 
element 𝑑𝑖𝑗 of the distance matrix between 𝑖 and 𝑗. The mean 𝑐𝜇 and deviation 𝑐𝜎 
of the closeness centrality for all nodes are expressed as Eqs (7) and (8), respectively.

Unlike the features described above, the Gini coefficient is not calculated for 
the graph 𝑔(𝑡) for each step but rather for a graph with sufficient edges generated, such 
as 𝑔(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥). The Gini coefficient is calculated based on the distribution of wealth given 
to a node and propagated to other nodes. 
 Using the element 𝑎𝑖𝑗 of the adjacent matrix 𝑨 of 𝑔(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥), the element 
𝑝𝑖𝑗 of the propagation matrix 𝑷 is expressed as in Eq (9). This equation implies that 
the wealth is equally distributed among the edges from nodes 𝑖 to h.
