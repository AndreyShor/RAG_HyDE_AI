• statistical, which arise due to random fluctuation of the finite number of samples collected
during a measurement. The statistical fluctuations in repeated observations of the same
process, are, by definition, uncorrelated in different kinematic bin.
• systematics, originating from the procedure adopted during the data taking, as well as
due to the design and calibration of the apparatus. Examples of systematic uncertainties
include trigger efficiency, the signal selection efficiency, the beam polarization uncertainty,
the luminosity uncertainty or the jet reconstruction uncertainties. Such uncertainties are
generally correlated in all the different kinematic bins.
While statistical uncertainties are are generally additive and depend on the number of observed
events (a naive scaling suggest ≈1/√Nc), the estimation of systematics require ad-hoc analysis
and, generally, it is a non-trivial procedure. Depending on the setup used for their determination,
systematics can be either additive either multiplicative. Given a set of measurements i =
1 . . . Ndat obtained with k = 1 . . . Nrep observations, of the same phenomenon x(k)

the data to follow a Gaussian distribution given by

where the expectation value σi is given by the average of all the observation Nrep and covij is

Specifically, measurements are presented in terms of the best values σi accompanied by a
number of uncertainties sm
i for each bin. As Eq. (2.12) is not practically useful, we have to
reconstruct the experimental covariance matrix via:
Cexp

where sm

and multiplicative systematics

. In case bin uncertainties are not symmetric, they are symmetrized with a standard
procedure and shifting the corresponding central value by
si = s+

σi →σi + s+

Finally, we can note that in the l.h.s of Eq. (2.13), multiplicative uncertainties are multiplied
with the best value of the measurements σi. This can originate the D’Agostini bias [148],
which might lead to a systematic underestimation of the underlying best fitting theory (PDF)
estimate. To avoid this, we substitute in Eq. (2.13), σi with a theoretical prediction of the value
Ti obtained with consistent parameters and a pre-determined PDF [149].
