FIG. 12: Analysis of the relationship between µ, resource quantity, and cooperation
fraction when the system reaches equilibrium. Players in the entire system, ΥSDG, and
ΥPDG are evenly divided into ten groups based on their resource levels. Left column
(panels (a) and (b)): Cooperation fraction and corresponding resource distribution across
different resource-based groups for the entire system. Right column (panels (c) and (d)):
Cooperation fraction and resource rank-plot for ΥSDG and ΥPDG, respectively. Panel (a)
presents the cooperation fraction for different values of µ, specifically µ = 0, µ = 0.2,
µ = 0.5, and µ = 0.5 with ξ = 0.1, where ξ represents the resource guarantee parameter.
The corresponding resource rank-plot for the system is shown in panel (b). The same
analysis is extended to ΥSDG and ΥPDG in Fig. A5(a)–(b) and Fig. A5(c)–(d), respectively.
The remaining control parameters are set to σ = 0.2 and b = 1.10.
