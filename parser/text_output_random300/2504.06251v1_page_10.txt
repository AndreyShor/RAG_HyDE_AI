FQAHE. These extracted hopping parameters provide a reliable description of the single-particle
dispersion of RG, laying an important foundation for further evaluating the effects of the moir´e
potential as well as many-body electron correlation in the correlated phenomena in aligned RG/BN.

Table 1 | Extracted key hopping parameters from R5G. Here we extract only the in-plane and out-
of-plane nearest-neighbor hopping parameters. Note that the out-of-plane second-nearest-neighbor
hopping γ2 is on the order of 10 meV32, which is too small to be extracted from our data.
Observation of enhanced flat band in aligned R5G/BN
Figure 3 shows the electronic structure of aligned R5G/BN sample S1. A strong flat band is
clearly resolved in the dispersion images measured parallel to the Γ-K direction (Fig. 3a-d, pointed
by red arrows), which is clearly different from data presented above on non-aligned R5G/BN.
Moreover, clear moir´e bands are captured in Fig. 3b (indicated by blue arrow), which are better
resolved in the zoom-in image in Fig. 3f. We would like to point out that ARPES is an extremely
surface-sensitive probe42,43 with the strongest contribution from the top layer, and therefore the
clear observation of moir´e bands in the NanoARPES data here suggests that the top R5G surface,
which is far away from the moir´e interface on the backside of R5G, is also modulated by the moir´e
