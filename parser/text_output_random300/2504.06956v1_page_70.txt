Proof of Proposition 6.1

This probability can be bounded by using Lemma 4.19, from which we deduce that is less than a
constant times eâˆ’c
âˆš
Lu/b, for some c > 0.
Step 2: We now show how we can remove the indicator function regarding the quantityM0,b+1,b(Î¥u+x
b
).
Fix x âˆˆ[L/2, A + L] and u âˆˆ[b1/4, b3/4]. Using again the fact that the quantity FÎ»
b,xâˆ’L,L(Î¥u+x
b
) is
by definition bounded above by L, we need to estimate the following probability
P0,u,b(M0,b+1,b(Î¥u+x
b
) > x âˆ’(A + L)) .
Thanks to (K2), the seed covariance function K is supported in B(0, 1) and so, recalling the definition
(4.1) of the field Î¦b, we have that, for all y âˆˆRd with |y| > eb,
Î¥u+x
b
(y) = âˆ’Bb + Zb(y) âˆ’
âˆš
2db + gb,u+x(y) ,
where we recall that Zb is the centred Gaussian field on Rd introduced in Definition 3.9. In particular,
leveraging again on the fact that K is supported in B(0, 1), we have that for all x, y âˆˆRd with |x|,
|y| > eb,
E[Zb(x)Zb(y)] =
Z b
0
K(eâˆ’s(x âˆ’y))ds .
In particular, this implies that the scaled field Zb(Â·)
def= Zb(ebÂ·) has the same covariance of the martingale
approximation at level b of a â‹†-scale invariant field with seed covariance function K. Therefore, by
rescaling space, the event {M0,b+1,b(Î¥b,g) > x âˆ’(A + L)} is equivalent to the event that
{M0,1,0(Zb + gb,u+x(ebÂ·)) âˆ’
âˆš
2db > Bb + x âˆ’(A + L)} .
Therefore, on the events {M0,1,0(gb,u+x(ebÂ·)) < b1/4/2} and {Bb > b1/4}, using the same argument
as in the proof of Lemma 4.3, we observe that, there exists a constants c > 0 such that, for any
x âˆˆ[0, A + L] and u âˆˆ[b1/4, b3/4],
P(M0,1,0(Zb) âˆ’
âˆš
2db > b1/4/2 + x âˆ’(A + L)) â‰²eâˆ’c(b1/4âˆ’(A+L)) .
On the other hand, to treat the event {M0,1,0(gb,u+x(ebÂ·)) â‰¥b1/4/2}, we can use the fact that the
supremum over B1 \ B0 of gb,u+x(ebÂ·) has uniform Gaussian tails, in order to obtain a similar
(stronger) bound.
Finally, the conclusion follows readily by combining the bounds provided in Steps 1 and 2.
Finally, we need to prove that the function FÎ»
b,xâˆ’L,L in GÎ»
(7.38) can be replaced by FÎ»
k,xâˆ’L,L for some
0 â‰¤k < b. To this end, for 0 â‰¤k < b, we define

and we claim the following lemma.
