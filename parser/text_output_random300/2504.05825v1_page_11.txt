 for varying degrees of spin-polarization. The solid, dashed, and dotted lines 
correspond to the propagation vector variations for fully spin-polarized (η = 0.81), partially 
polarized (η = 0.008), and unpolarized (η = 0) plasmas, respectively. Notably, wave power 
transmission increases with greater spin-polarization and stabilizes at higher values of the 
propagation vector. Specifically, for the fully spin-polarized case, the propagation vector exceeds 
that of the unpolarized plasma by approximately 83% around k ≈ 0.8. This discrepancy is due to 
the increased Fermi pressure resulting from spin-polarization and the electron's spin magnetic 
moment, both of which are crucial in the presence of a magnetic field. 
4. Analysis of Ion Acoustic Solitary wave 
 
In this section, we examine the nature of an obliquely propagating ion acoustic wave in a 
magnetized quantum plasma, the standard perturbation technique [35-37] has been adopted.
