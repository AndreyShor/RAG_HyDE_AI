codimension of Mk(φ) matches the expected codimension then the cohomology class [Mk(φ)]
is given by Porteous’ formula. This is in particular the case if all of the entries of the matrix
representation of φ are sections of globally generated line bundles on V .
Denoting by c0, c1, . . . the Chern classes of F/E, Porteous’ formula states that
[Mk(φ)] = det

To illustrate this, let us consider an f × e matrix B such that the entries of the i-th row
are sections of a line bundle Li on some space W. We can interpret this as a bundle map
B : O⊕e
W →

i=1

that we denote by the same symbol in a slight abuse of notation. Let us assume for example
that f = 2 and e = 3. Then the degeneracy locus M1(B) = { corank B = 1 } has expected
codimension 2 and Porteous’ formula implies that it represents the cohomology class
[M1(B)] = c1(L1)2 + c1(L1)c1(L2) + c1(L2)2 .

The geometry of b
Xr and Xr
In order to understand the geometry of b
Xr
1 and b
Xr
2 it will be useful to interpret them as
a special case of a slightly more general construction and consider instead the complete
intersection inside V = P4 × P2 × P2 × P2 that is associated to the conﬁguration matrix

with ai,j ∈N. The corresponding complete intersection will be a Calabi-Yau threefold if the
sum of all ai,j equals 5. One can easily check, for example using CohomCalg [61, 62], that
only two cases lead to a Calabi-Yau threefold with h1,1 = 4, namely
(a1,1, a1,2, a2,1, a2,2, a3,1, a3,2) =
(
(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0) for b
Xr
1 ,
(1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0) for b
Xr
2 .
(4.6)
For now, let us leave the choice for ai,j open and only assume that H2( b
Xr, Z) = Z4. 13
13As already mentioned in Section 2, we conjecture that H2( b
Xr, Z) is torsion free. This mostly allows us to
simplify our notation without aﬀecting our results in any essential way.
