lumped elements along the two lateral axes, x and y in Fig. 1, enables
independent control of the two linear polarizations in 1 × 1 and
2×2 cell configurations. More complex functionalities such as beam
steering, require tuning and clustering into supercells [14], whereas
simpler functions like plane-wave absorption and polarization con-
version rely on global tuning.
B. Transmission Line Modeling
The design process begins with theoretical modeling to guide
parameter selection, leveraging ECM and TL modeling (TLM) ap-
proaches [16], [17]. Geometric parameters—such as unit cell period,
patch gaps, substrate material, and thickness—are initially defined
based on the ECM/TLM model. Patch size is chosen to align with
the operating frequency, while substrate properties are adjusted for
optimal resonance. Resistance and capacitance values are selected
for accurate frequency tuning. Following this, FWS using established
commercial software (CST and HFSS) refine and validate the design
[8]. This work focuses on square elements for their simplicity and
isotropic response, assuming perfect electrical conductors (PEC) with
zero thickness for further simplification.
The chosen unit cell architecture can be efficiently modeled using
TLM: Dielectric slabs are modeled as short TL segments whose
characteristic impedance and propagation constant depend on their
permittivity and on the incident wavevector k and polarization,
decomposed in transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM)
planes; note that k incorporates the information of the the plane
wave direction in 3D space and the harmonic frequency. Patterned
conductor layers are modeled by an equivalent complex surface
admittance Ysurf or impedance Zsurf = 1/Ysurf, which is computed
by approximate dispersive ECMs; ground planes are equivalent to
short-circuits. This TLM approach is depicted in Fig. 2 and its validity
is excellent for substrates with electric thickness above λ/4 below
which near-field coupling progressively diminishes the TLM-ECM
accuracy.
The input impedance of the unit cell beyond the input plane is
a function of various parameters including the operating frequency,
angle of incidence, polarization, geometry and lumped loading:
Zin = Zin (f, θ, pol., geom., Zlumped) .
(1)
Knowing Zin, the reflection coefficient can be calculated via the
relation
Γ = Zin −ZTL,inp
Zin + ZTL,inp = YTL,inp −Yin
YTL,inp + Yin ,
(2)
where ZTL,inp is the characteristic impedance of the “input” TL
that feeds the structure. More generally speaking, the characteristic

Fig. 2. (a) Oblique incidence of a plane wave on the unit cell of a metasurface
composed of a loaded patch grid sitting on the interface of air and a PEC-
backed dielectric substrate; the 3D wavevector k contains harmonic frequency
and direction information while the polarization can be either TE or TM; the
angles θ1,2 are computed by Snell’s law. (b) Equivalent TLM used to compute
the unit cell’s reflection coefficient; note that the loaded patch grid is represent
by an ECM-derived Zsurf while the TL characteristic impedance depend on
k in the medium and polarization.
impedance of a plane wave traveling in this equivalent z-directed TL
under oblique incidence is given by:
ZTL =
( η0
√εr cos θ,
TM pol.

√εr sec θ,
TE pol.
(3)
where η0 ≈377 Ωis the characteristic impedance of vacuum; in
normal incidence, ZTL matches the bulk medium wave impedance;
for lossy dielectrics, the Imag{εr} leads to absorption.
In the absence of the patterned metallic layer (Zsurf = ∞in
Fig. 2), the input impedance is simply the short-circuit (ground-plane)
transformed by an h-long TL, where h is the substrate thickness, i.e.,
Zin = Zsub,GND = jZTL,sub tan(βTL,subh).
(4)
In this expression, βTL,sub =
p
k2
sub −k2
tan is the propagation constant
along the TL, where ksub = k0√εr,sub and ktan = kinp sin θ1 =
ksub sin θ2; the latter is Snell’s law, which can be rewritten in its most
usual form as √εr,inp sin θ1 = √εr,sub sin θ2; in this framework it is
used to compute the plane wave direction θ2 in the substrate when
the incidence angle θ1 and the refractive indices of the cladding and
substrate are known.
C. ECM for Unloaded Patch-Grid
The most crucial part in the above methodology is the broadband
surface impedance of the patterned metallic layer. When simulated
or measured data are available, retrieval methods can be used [18].
In this work, we aim to develop a simple yet accurate enough
analytical ECM for the surface impedance which can then guide
FWS-based optimization, if needed. Unless otherwise stated, the
plane of incidence required to distinguish the two orthogonal linear
polarizations (TE and TM) matches one of the two principal planes,
xz or yz in Fig. 1.
Starting from the 1 × 1 cell, Fig. 1(a), we note that in the absence
of loading (e.g., Rseries →∞), the dispersive patch-grid impedance
can be computed by the high-impedance surface ECM developed in
[19]: When the patch grid is embedded within two not-too-different
different dielectric media, we can consider an equivalent bulk medium
of effective permittivity given by εr,eff = (εr,1+εr,2)/2, where εr,1/2
are bulk permittivities of the two media, e.g., the air cladding and the
dielectric substrate in the case of Fig. 1. Now, the capacitive surface
impedance of a wide-patch/narrow-gap grid (s ≪D) is given by
