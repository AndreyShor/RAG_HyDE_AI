FIG. 2.
The residue prescription and different singularities.
A comparison of RSum and mRes for χC(ω), with
∆θ = ∆0 + ∆1 cos(4θ) for C ∈{A1g, B1g, B2g} and the same number of subdivisions, N = 40. The exact calculation, obtained
from quadrature, is shown as dashed lines. The top panel is for the nodal anisotropic s-wave case, ∆1 > ∆0, whilst the bottom
panel is for the nodeless case, ∆1 < ∆0. The prescription is capable of effectively reproducing the many different types of
singularities.

EXAMPLES
In this section, we demonstrate some practical exam-
ples where we show the applicability and the improved
performance of this prescription. As before, in all these
cases, the exact calculation is performed using an adap-
tive quadrature routine. We then compare how well the
results computed using the RSum and the mRes methods
converge to it for a fixed number of sub-intervals. The
comparisons will be between the Riemann sum and the
residue prescription. While it should be sufficient to stick
to the results of Fig. 1 and move on to error analysis, we
think that it is beneficial to show how convincingly our
method correctly captures the slopes, jumps and singu-
larities of the integrated results in diverse scenarios.
A.
Spectral functions
Let us return to the evaluation of Eq. (7). We chose
this function as it is sufficiently complex to display vari-
ous spectral features in terms of (i) different power laws
in the limit ω →0, (ii) the presence or absence of sin-
gular peaks at various ω’s and (iii) even the presence
of discontinuous step jumps. In this subsection, we will
demonstrate that our prescription covers all these differ-
ent singular cases and faithfully reproduces the expected
curve while significantly outperforming the rectangle rule
for the same mesh size.
Let us also take this opportunity to explain the physi-
cal nature of the response function χC(ω), Eq. (7). This
function captures the Raman scattering cross-section
from a 2D superconductor with order parameter ∆θ. The
choices for C represent the orthogonal channels in which
the contributions from the fermionic scattering can be
broken down into. Different channels can be accessed by
appropriately selecting the polarization of the incident
and scattered light in the Raman experiment. The re-
sponse χC, by itself, is insufficient to reproduce the real
physical response as this expression does not account for
the many-body effects. Nevertheless, it forms a build-
ing block of the full many-body-corrected response and,
hence, it becomes important to compute χC accurately.
We refer the reader to the extensive literature on this
subject for more information [33–37].
The choice of ∆θ = ∆0 cos(2θ), that was used in
Fig. 1, actually corresponds to a so-called d-wave super-
conductor (best example being the cuprate superconduc-
tors [38, 39]). However, we have other materials such as

FIG. 3. Faster convergence of mRes. Side-by-side com-
parison of the (a) RSum and (b) mRes prescription for dif-
ferent numbers of subdivisions N.
We see that the latter
converges already for a very low (even an order of magnitude
lower) value of N. Here, we show the nodeless anisotropic s-
wave case and the responses are shifted such that the dashed
horizontal lines mark the zeros.
