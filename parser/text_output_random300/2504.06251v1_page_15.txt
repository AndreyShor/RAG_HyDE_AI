potential on the electronic structure is smaller than our experimental results. For example, in the
calculated electronic structure (Extended Data Fig. 9), moir´e bands outside R5G bands are barely
discernible even when using a moir´e potential energy of 30 meV, again suggesting that the moir´e
potential in the calculations is underestimated. How to properly incorporate the synergistic effect
of moir´e potential into the physics of aligned R5G/BN would require extensive theoretical investi-
gations, and here our experimental results provide useful benchmarks to testify different theoretical
models.
Conclusion and outlook
To summarize, through high-resolution NanoARPES measurements and careful compari-
son of experimental results with theoretical calculations, we extract important hopping parame-
ters which are essential for determining the fundamental electronic structure of R5G, including
the higher order hopping parameters whose values sensitively determine the trigonal warping and
Fermi surface topology etc. Moreover, the observation of moir´e bands and enhanced flat band in-
tensity highlights the important role of moir´e potential in the aligned R5G/BN. Considering that a
variety of novel quantum phases including FQAHE have been reported only when RG is subjected
to a moir´e superlattice2,3,31,44–47, how the moir´e potential affects the intricate topology property of
the flat band, the charge modulation, and the gap in aligned R5G/BN is critical for understanding
the underlying physics. Our work calls attention to the strong effect of moir´e potential on the elec-
tronic structure of aligned R5G/BN even in the moir´e-distant regime, which could help to reconcile
different experimental observations and theoretical models.
