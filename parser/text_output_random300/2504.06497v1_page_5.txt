A growing body of research focuses on leveraging quantum-enhanced data representations to
improve classical machine learning tasks. Rath et..al [27] investigated how quantum data en-
coding could enhance traditional learning models, emphasizing the need to exploit quantum
properties for improved feature transformations.
Squeezed-state encoding has significant applications across various areas in quantum information
science [28]. One approach, explored by Li et al. (2021), uses squeezed-state encoding in quan-
tum kernel methods to enhance quantum machine learning tasks by improving the feature space,
which allows for more efficient data representation and processing [29]. Tiunov et al. (2024) focus
on learning continuous-variable quantum states, utilizing squeezed light in multimode quantum
state estimation, which helps in achieving more precise quantum predictions. In the context of
quantum communication, Lau & Plenio (2024) highlight the role of multimode squeezed states
in quantum networks, reducing noise and improving communication fidelity over long distances
[30]. Finally, Yan et al. (2024) show the integral role of squeezed states in quantum teleporta-
tion, facilitating entanglement distribution and improving communication efficiency in quantum
networks, thus enabling more robust and scalable quantum communication systems [31]. These
advancements underscore the broad applicability of squeezed-state encoding in quantum tech-
nologies.
Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. Encoding classical data into quantum
states is computationally expensive and constrained by the limited number of qubits available
in current hardware [32]. Quantum error correction remains a significant hurdle, as decoherence
and noise can distort encoded information [33, 34]. Additionally, the interpretability of quantum
machine learning models poses challenges, as quantum algorithms often function as black-box
models.
The practical implementation of quantum data encoding in real-world machine learning applica-
tions is still in its infancy. High computational resource demands and the limited accessibility of
quantum hardware hinder broader adoption [35, 36]. While theoretical frameworks for quantum-
enhanced learning are expanding, experimental validations and empirical studies are necessary
to assess their real-world feasibility [37, 38].
This study aims to contribute to this growing research area by empirically evaluating quantum
data encoding techniques specifically tailored for tabular data in classical machine learning ap-
plications. By leveraging quantum simulation environments, we seek to provide insights into the
comparative effectiveness of various encoding approaches, bridging the gap between theoretical
advancements and practical implementations in hybrid quantum-classical learning frameworks.
In summary, quantum data encoding presents promising opportunities for classical machine learn-
ing but also introduces significant computational and implementation challenges. This research
endeavors to systematically investigate the impact of quantum encoding on classical models,
shedding light on the potential benefits and limitations of this emerging paradigm.
