Conclusions
In this paper we presented a solution for the moments of the Lieb–Liniger model including
perturbative and non-perturbative corrections, i.e. a trans-series solution.
The perturbative
parts of the moments [11, 12] can be extracted through a method devised by Volin in [13, 14].
Since the integral equation describing the rapidity density has support on the interval [−B, B],
the moments are expressed as a perturbative expansion in 1/B and also contain log(B) terms.
It proved advantageous [17] to introduce a running coupling v, which leads to a cancellation of
the log B terms.
The conserved charges of the Lieb–Liniger model are given by its moments. A second order
differential equation [7] relates the moments ϕℓand ϕℓ−1, allowing to recursively generate the
higher moments up to integration constants. In fact, there are two integration constants for
each moment; one of these can be fixed through a constraint [7]. The remaining constant is
the coefficient at order 1/v2 in the perturbative expansion and can be obtained by using Volin’s
method [13, 14]. With the constants fixed, we can compute ϕℓup to arbitrary perturbative
order.
Further, we used the methods developed in [18, 21, 22] for relativistic models to express the
observables Oα,β as a trans-series using a perturbatively defined basis Aα,β. The perturbative
basis Aα,β in turn satisfies a system of differential equations, that allow to construct all basis
elements from one explicitly given element. This element, for instance A0,0, can be determined
using the algorithm of Volin.
To write the trans-series solution for the moments, we need
to introduce the generalized moments.
This generalization completes the perturbative basis
necessary to construct non-perturbative corrections to the moments. Moreover, we checked that
the trans-series solution is indeed a solution of the set of ODEs for the observables (31)–(34) as
well as (35) for the moments. Let us emphasize again, that this allows us to calculate any moment
as a trans-series to arbitrary order in the coupling v including its non-perturbative corrections
in e−1/v. As an application of the trans-series solution we discussed the disk capacitor problem,
which can be related to the Lieb–Liniger integral equation.
The results we presented were mainly expressed in terms of the coupling v, as it allows
to write equations in a more compact manner. However, the Lieb–Liniger model comes with
a naturally defined physical coupling g2 given in (3), that is proportional to the first moment.
Expressing v in terms of g allowed us to reexpress any moment in terms of the physical coupling.
Finally, we turned to numerical investigations. By analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the
generalized moment ϕ(0)
1 , we could measure its alien derivative numerically, providing a consis-
tency check of (75). Furthermore, we checked that the trans-series indeed matches the solution
obtained from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz with high precision, both in the couplings v
and g, respectively. Remarkably, including five non-perturbative orders, we found agreement at
least up to the order 10−96.
