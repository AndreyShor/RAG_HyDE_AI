The expression before the parenthesis in Eq. (98), and therefore the amplitudes necessary for PREP, only
depend on I through the pseudoion type ζI. For both the local and non-local interaction terms, we first load
the ion type, indexed on I, using a QROM |I⟩|0⟩7→|I⟩|ζI⟩(this shared cost is accounted for in the cost for
the non-local term). The state preparations below are then controlled on the register encoding ζI. For the
BEloc routine we perform an LCU with the preparation,

The subroutine PREPloc,1 is a state preparation of 5 elements (the c variable sum just gives a |+⟩state). We
achieve this with coherent alias sampling; see App. E.4.2. The dominant preparation cost is from PREPloc,2,
which invokes quantum rejection sampling as described in Ref. [75] with Type I and Type III reference states
discussed in App. C. However, we note that the structure of this state is very similar to other states that
we seek to prepare; in particular, Eq. (103) is a state that looks similar to Eq. (113) for the non-local term.
We reduce costs by combining these preparations; i.e. we use a single unitary state preparation routine to
prepare the reference state for the non-local and local term; here, careful conditioning on the term selection
register and the register containing |s⟩flags which sub-case is appropriate and prepares the correct reference
state in the correct branch. See App. E.5.3 for a detailed construction.
