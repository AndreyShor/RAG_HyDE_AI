The function W(E) has a well deﬁned maximum in
E = ¯E.
We can deﬁne the “width” ∆E of the curve
W = W(E) through the relation
W( ¯E)∆E = 1.
(13)
or
w( ¯E)∆Γ = 1,
(14)
where
∆Γ = dΓ( ¯E)
dE
∆E,
(15)
is the number of quantum states corresponding to the
energy interval ∆E at ¯E. This is also called the statistical
weight of the macroscopic state of the subregion, and its
logarithm
S = log ∆Γ,
(16)
is the entropy of the subregion. The entropy cannot be
negative.
We can also write the deﬁnition of entropy in another
form, expressing it directly in terms of the distribution
function. In fact we can rewrite Eq. (6) as
log w( ¯E) = α + β ¯E,
(17)
so that
S = log ∆Γ = −log w( ¯E) = −⟨log w(En)⟩
= −

ρn log ρn = −tr(ˆρ log ˆρ), (18)
where ‘tr’ denotes the trace.
Let us now consider again the closed region and let us
suppose that ∆Γ1, ∆Γ2, . . . are the statistical weights of
the various subregions, then the statistical weight of the
entire region can be written as
∆Γ =

(19)
and

(20)
the entropy is additive.
Let us consider again the microcanonical distribution
function for a closed region,
dw ∝δ(E −E0)

∝δ(E −E0)eS Y

dEi,
(21)
where S = P
i Si(Ei) and E = P
i Ei. Now we know that
the most probable values of the energies Ei are the mean
values ¯Ei. This means that the function S(E1, E2, . . .)
must have its maximum when Ei = ¯Ei for all i. But the
¯Ei are the values of the energies of the subregions that
correspond to the complete statistical equilibrium of the
region. We then reach the important conclusion that the
entropy of a closed region in a state of complete statistical
equilibrium has its maximum value (for a given energy
of the region E0).
Let us now consider again the problem to ﬁnd the dis-
tribution function of the subregion, i.e. of any macro-
scopic region being a small part of a large closed region.
We then apply the microcanonical distribution function
to the entire region. We will call the “medium” what re-
mains of the spacetime region once the small macroscopic
part has been removed. The microcanonical distribution
can be written as
dw ∝δ(E + E′ −E0)dΓdΓ′,
(22)
where E, dΓ and E′, dΓ′ refer to the subregion and to the
“medium” respectively, and E0 is the energy of the closed
region that must equal the sum E + E′ of the energies of
the subregion and of the medium.
We are looking for the probability wn of one state of
the region so that the subregion is in some well deﬁned
quantum state (with energy En), i.e. a well deﬁned mi-
croscopic state. Let us then take dΓ = 1, set E = En
and integrate respect to Γ′
ρn ∝
Z
δ(En + E′ −E0)dΓ′
∝
Z
eS′
∆E′ δ(En + E′ −E0)dE′
∝
 
eS′
∆E′
!
E′=E0−En
.
(23)
We use now the fact that, since the subregion is small,
its energy En will be small respect to E0
S′(E0 −En) ≈S′(E0) −En
dS′(E0)
dE0
.
(24)
But we know that the derivative of the entropy with re-
spect to the energy is β = 1/kBT where kB is Boltzmann
constant and T is the temperature of the closed space-
time region (that coincides with that of the subregion
with which it is in equilibrium). So we ﬁnally reach the
following result
ρn ∝e−βEn.
(25)
which is the canonical distribution function.
