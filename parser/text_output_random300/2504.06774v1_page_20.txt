where u = (ux, uy, uz) is the velocity field, p is the pressure, ρ is the fluid density, and
ν is the kinematic viscosity. The first equation represents momentum conservation,
while the second enforces the incompressibility condition.
In the 2D case, the simulation is performed at Re = 130. At this Reynolds number,
the flow is characterized by unsteady behavior due to the formation of a von Kármán
vortex street in the wake of the cylinder. The computational domain extends 15D
upstream and 50D downstream in the streamwise direction, with the cylinder dia-
meter D normalized to D = 1. The dataset has been obtained from Ref [54], where
the spatial dimensions are nx = 100 points in the streamwise direction, ny = 100
points in the vertical direction, and nt = 500 the temporal steps, with a time step
∆t = 0.2.

Extending the problem to three dimensions introduces spanwise variations and re-
quires capturing all three velocity components. The flow becomes unsteady at Re =
46, where a Hopf bifurcation initiates flow with two-dimensional oscillations. Bey-
ond Re = 189, a second bifurcation causes three-dimensionality for specific span-
wise wavelengths. The boundary conditions are consistent with the 2D case but
account for the spanwise velocity component. The domain has a spatial dimension
of nx = 100, ny = 40, nz = 64 in the spanwise direction, and nt = 599 temporal
snapshots, with a time step ∆t = 1. The data set presented by Le Clainche et al.
[55] has been utilized for the 3D cylinder case. The 2D simulation considers nvar = 2
variables, representing the velocity components (u, v) in the streamwise and vertical
directions, while the 3D simulation expands to nvar = 3 variables to include the
spanwise velocity component (w).
The three-dimensional cylinder flow data set is particularly challenging due to the
strong coupling of dynamics across the three spatial dimensions. The flow is transit-
ory, with the spanwise component only beginning to develop near the 300 snapshot
mark. This data set serves as an excellent benchmark for testing and validating
the developed hybrid model, providing insights into its robustness. Both cases are
simulated using the open-source spectral element solver Nek5000, which solves the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
