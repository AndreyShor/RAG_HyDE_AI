Table 1: Table of Z4 partial traces with trivially-acting Z2 ⊂Z4 and nontrivial
quantum symmetry. Each Z4 partial trace matches a Z4/Z2 ≅Z2 partial trace up
to a phase, determined by the quantum symmetry.
For a fusion category C, a C-symmetric igSPT phase is a gapless phase protected
by C symmetry that cannot be deformed to a gapped SPT phase.
The deﬁning properties of igSPT phases naturally match our anomaly resolu-
tion interest:
• Gapless: The theory whose anomaly we would like to resolve is a general
QFT instead of a TQFT.
• Intrinsically: The non-deformability to a gapped SPT implies the anomaly of
the original C-symmetry, due to one of the deﬁning property of the anomaly
that it obstructs a gapped SPT.
• SPT: The theory after anomaly resolution enjoys/is protected by a D-symmetry,
and does not decompose. If it decomposes, then it would be an SSB phase
instead of an SPT. Again recall that the deﬁning property of anomaly is
obstruction to a SPT phase. Therefore a genuine resolution for the anomaly
is to make the resolved theory have a single universe (unique ground state
in the context of TQFT).
(Note that igSPT phases are only deﬁned in condensable algebras, which are more
specialized than merely special symmetric Frobenius algebras. So, implicit in the
deﬁnition is that the larger nonanomalous symmetry is condensable, not merely
gaugeable (special symmetric Frobenius). See Appendix B for more information
on the distinction between condensable and gaugeable algebras.)
