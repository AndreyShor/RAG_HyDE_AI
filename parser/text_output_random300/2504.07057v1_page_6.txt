∆COD show relatively little change, which implies competing effects of changes in
∆L and ∆Reff on COD.

3 Diel changes in CF adjustment
While the addition of ship-emitted aerosols generally increases CF in ship-tracks [7,
10], the CF enhancement (∆CF) has distinct diel changes. ∆CF , defined as changes
of CF in polluted clouds inside ship-tracks relative to background clouds, shows an
increase with their age starting at around 10 hr mark (Figure 3A) while average
∆CF is around 2%. The 10 hour age mark roughly separates ship-track segments that
are formed during nighttime conditions from those mostly only experience daytime
condition for our study area because the difference between the local overpass time,
~2pm and the sunrise time, ~6am, is 8hrs. Ship-track segments that are older than
10 hr are formed during the night and experience nighttime conditions. The ∆CF of
ship-track clouds formed during the night is greater than those that do not experience
nighttime conditions. The difference is statistically significant at above 99% confidence
level. The relative increase for nighttime clouds, (∆CFnight −∆CFday)/∆CFday ,
is 57%. Nighttime increase in ∆CF is consistent with large-eddy simulations results
[5, 19–21].
