FIG. 11: Characteristic configuration snapshots of the spatial multi-game framework at
different MCS steps. The first row (panels (a)–(e)) presents the evolution of resource
distribution, where darker colors indicate lower resource levels. Panel (A) is a magnified
section of panel (e). The second row (panels (f)–(j)) shows the evolution of strategy
distribution within ΥSDG and ΥPDG. Panel (B) is a magnified section of panel (j).
Defectors and cooperators are represented in blue and red for ΥSDG, and in dark blue and
orange for ΥPDG. The third row (panels (k)–(o)) illustrates the co-evolution of strategies
and resources in ΥSDG and ΥPDG. Panel (C) is a magnified section of panel (o). Within
ΥSDG, cooperators and defectors are represented in orange and dark blue, respectively.
Within ΥPDG, cooperators and defectors are represented in pure green and dodger blue,
yellow-green and cyan, and purple and magenta. Columns from left to right correspond to
MCS steps 1, 5, 50, 100, and 100000. The remaining control parameters are set to σ = 0.5,
µ = 0.5, and b = 1.10.
to resource availability, with resources playing a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
different types of cooperators. Moreover, ΥSDG exhibits a stronger capacity for resource
acquisition, reinforcing previous findings.
To gain deeper insights into the evolution of resource distribution and its interaction
with the different games and strategies, we analyze characteristic snapshots of individuals’
resources, strategy dynamics, and their coevolution over time, as shown in Fig. 11.
