there is some dependency between these parameters, thus
making it even harder to tune the system into a region
of parameter space hosting true PMMs.

Appendix A: Zeeman energy on the middle QD and
larger Zeeman energy
In this section we adapt Eq. (2b) as follows:
∆Z,j =
(
∆Z
if j even,
∆Z,S
if j odd,
(A1)
i.e., we introduce a non-zero Zeeman energy on the super-
conducting QDs. Furthermore, we increase the Zeeman
energy on the normal QDs.
We consider the minimal
chain (N = 2) and find that false PMMs exist in systems
with ∆Z,S/∆= 0.4 and ∆Z/∆= 2.0, see Fig. 8. The ra-
tio of true to false PMMs behaves qualitatively the same
as for the data shown in the main text, where ∆Z,S = 0
and ∆Z/∆= 0.8.
Appendix B: Finite on-site Coulomb interaction
In the main text, we set U = 0 and could consequently
use the BdG formulation of the Hamiltonian defined in
Eq. (1) for the long and infinite chain limits [73].
In
this formulation, the topological invariant is defined as a
Pfaffian.
In Ref. [1], the Majorana number M(H) = ±1 was
introduces. Having M(H) = −1 (+1) means that the
system is in the topological (trivial) phase and it is de-
fined as
P[H(L1 + L2)] = M(H)P[H(L1)]P[H(L2)],
(B1)
where P[H(L)] is the particle number parity of the
ground state of the Hamiltonian H(L) that describes a
system of length L with periodic boundary conditions.

FIG. 8.
Classification of true and false PMMs in a minimal
chain with ∆Z/∆= 2 and ∆Z,S/∆= 0.4, see Eq. (A1). This
figure and its interpretation are equivalent to Figs. 5(j) and 6,
but with different Zeeman energies. The larger Zeeman en-
ergy on the normal QDs and non-zero Zeeman energy on the
superconducting QDs do not lead to any qualitative differ-
ence.
The threshold values for panels (a)-(c) are the same
as for Figs. 6(a)-(c), respectively, and the threshold values
for panel (d) are the same as for Fig. 5(j), except for Eex,th,
whose values are given in the legend.
It is shown in Ref. [1] that in noninteracting systems,
the Majorana number is equivalent to the topological in-
variant derived from the Pfaffian. However, if U > 0,
the system is interacting, and therefore, the Pfaffian can
no longer be used to calculate the topological invari-
ant. Nevertheless, Eq. (B1) remains valid [1]. We set
L1 = L2 ≡L, thus Eq. (B1) becomes P[H(2L)] =
M(H)P[H(L)]2 = M(H). However, the length L should
be big compared to the MBS localization length, thus re-
quiring DMRG [96–98] for systems with U > 0.
This
is problematic since DMRG fares badly with periodic
boundary conditions [97], taking much longer to con-
verge.
Thus, even with DMRG, we keep L relatively
short, which may lead to misclassifications. To double-
check we also calculate ∆E(∆Z) in a longer chain using
DMRG in a system with open boundary conditions, as
was done in Ref. [73]. We emphasize that this does not
guarantee the absence of misclassifications, but we as-
sume that there is not a statistically significant number
of them.
In this Appendix, we set U/∆= 100, then continue
as in the main text, i.e., we randomly choose a point in
the (∆Z/∆, t/∆, ΦSOI) parameter space and use the opti-
mization algorithm described in Appendix D of Ref. [72]
to tune µN and µS. We then check if the state satisfies
the TR condition given in Eq. (8). If they do, then we
calculate the Majorana number M according to Eq. (B1)
to determine whether the state is a true or false PMMs.
The conclusions are qualitatively the same as for U = 0
in the main text, see Fig. 9.
