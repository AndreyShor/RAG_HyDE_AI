the QLSA, whereas methods in the latter two categories apply Hamiltonian simulation directly. Mathemati-
cally, methods in the latter two categories yield similar final expressions, although their derivation procedures
differ significantly.
Methods in the first category consist of three steps: discretizing the time variable, encoding the discretized
linear differential equation into an enlarged linear system, and solving the resulting linear system using QLSA.
This approach was first introduced by [4], which uses linear multi-step methods to discretize the time variable.
However, due to the limitations of the discretization method, the query complexity in [4] is poly(1/ϵ) even
if the most efficient QLSA is applied. To improve the dependence on the precision ϵ, Berry et al. [7] applies
a truncated Taylor series to approximate the propagator exp(At) for autonomous ODEs and encodes the
evaluation process of the truncated Taylor series into a linear system. The dependence on ϵ is improved to
poly(log(1/ϵ)). The analysis in [7] requires A to be diagonalizable, i.e., there exists an invertible matrix V
such that V −1AV is a diagonal matrix, and the final complexity depends linearly on the condition number
of V , κV = ∥V ∥2·∥V −1∥2. To eliminate the dependence on κV , Krovi [32] proposes a modified linear system
that also encodes the evaluation process of the truncated Taylor series into a linear system, and improves
the analysis in [7]. In [32], the resulting complexity depends on C(A) := max0≤t≤T ∥exp(At)∥2 instead of
κV . More recently, Dong et al. [13] revisited the analysis in [7] and obtained a similar complexity result to
[32] without modifying the linear system. Additionally, Childs and Liu [11] and Berry and C. S. Costa [5]
generalize methods in this category to address non-autonomous linear ODEs, i.e., time-dependent A(t) and
b(t), using spectral method and Dyson’s series, respectively.
The second category of methods originates from [3]. These methods are based on a novel integral expression
for the non-unitary evolution operator T e
R t
0 A(s)ds, where T denotes the time-ordering operator. By decom-
posing A(t) into its Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts, i.e., A(t) = L(t) + ıH(t), where L(t) = A(t)+A†(t)

and H(t) = A(t)−A†(t)

This identity holds under the assumption that L(t) is negative semi-definite, i.e., L(t) ⪯0 for all t ∈[0, T].
Later, in [2], a large family of identities similar to Eq. (2) is unveiled, and the method in this category
is improved to achieve near-optimal dependence on all parameters. The extension to the inhomogeneous
case is also possible via Duhamel’s principle.
Compared to the methods in the first category, methods
in this category consider the non-autonomous cases directly and achieve the optimal state preparation cost.
However, methods in this category only give the terminal state, whereas methods in the first category provide
information throughout the evolution.
The third category of methods is known as Schrödingerization [23, 25]. These methods use a warped phase
transformation to map the linear differential equation into a higher-dimensional system, where it manifests
as a Schrödinger equation in the Fourier space of the extra variable. In this way, the linear ODEs with
non-unitary dynamics are converted into a system that evolves under unitary dynamics, i.e., a Schrödinger
equation, which can be simulated on quantum computing via Hamiltonian simulation. Schrödingerization
has been applied to a wide range of problems, including differential equations with various boundary con-
ditions [10, 17, 19, 24, 26–28, 30], iterative methods in numerical linear algebra [20], and more. In [29],
Schrödingerization is extended to solve linear differential equations with inhomogeneous terms, which is the
same problem addressed in this paper. The resulting query complexity depends linearly on 1/ϵ. More re-
cently, methods in this category have been adapted for analog quantum simulation [21, 22]. Explicit quantum
circuit implementations corresponding to Schrödingerization have been explored in [18, 31].
We propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving linear autonomous ODEs (1) in this paper, which falls
within the first category of existing quantum algorithms. Our key contributions and innovations can be
summarized as follows.
• We replace the Taylor series approximation with the Padé approximation of the matrix exponential in
related quantum algorithms [7, 13, 32]. The Padé approximation, a rational function commonly used
in classical computing to approximate matrix exponentials [1, 16, 33], achieves similar accuracy to the
Taylor approximation but with a lower order, though it requires a matrix inversion.
• We propose a matrix encoding for the Padé approximation, denoted as L. The encoding avoids explicit
matrix inversion and maintains a comparable level of complexity to the matrix encoding used for Taylor
approximation, as presented in [7, 13, 32]. In contrast to the Taylor approximation, whose corresponding
