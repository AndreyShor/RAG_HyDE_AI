a 4D dataset is generated, encompassing three spatial dimensions and time. To achieve a 
consistent and accurate 4D scan of the shear waves, it is essential that the wave field remains 
identical at each scan position on the 2D surface. This uniformity ensures that the OCT scans 
can be considered a comprehensive scan, allowing the acquired data to be integrated into a 4D 
representation of shear wave dynamics in the medium over time. In MFR-OCE, the 
displacement field corresponding to each excitation frequency is extracted to estimate the SWS. 
Thus, precise synchronization of all excitation frequencies with the imaging system is crucial 
for accurate multi-frequency shear wave analysis.

and the imaging system in MFR-OCE. 
As the response of the piezo actuator varies across different frequencies, the amplitude of 
the induced shear wave field also differs depending on the excitation frequency. To ensure 
robust measurements and achieve a nearly uniform amplitude across all frequencies, a tuning 
process was applied. The shear wave field amplitude was first estimated for each excitation 
frequency, and an appropriate scaling factor was then applied to the excitation signal to level 
wave field amplitudes across frequencies. A multi-frequency signal with five frequencies 
including 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 2500 Hz was generated in MATLAB and 
imported into the excitation system. Each frequency was assigned a random initial phase. 
Figure 4 illustrates the combination of multiple sinusoidal single-frequency waves 
(洧녤1(洧노) 洧노洧녶 洧녤洧녵(洧노)) to generate a multi-frequency excitation waveform (洧녤洧녴洧녭(洧노)). In the frequency 
domain, different excitation frequencies are distinguishable by their higher amplitudes (洧냢(洧녭)).
