Local structure of extremal points

To obtain (4.40), we can apply Lemma 4.17 as in Step 2.
Step 4: By combining (4.37), (4.38), and (4.40), we have thus far proven that for any ε > 0, by taking
b > l both sufficiently large,

b .
Therefore, to conclude, it is sufficient to show that we can replace H0,u,b
l,λ (F) on the right-hand side of
the previous display by Hl,λ(F). This is achieved by using the absolute continuity of the law of the
Brownian bridge with respect to the law of the Brownian motion. We recall that for any 0 ≤l < b, it
holds that

and so, it holds that

Therefore, using the boundedness of F, the difference |Hl,λ(F) −H0,u,b

which can be made arbitrarily small by taking b large enough, uniformly over u ∈[b1/4, b3/4]. Hence,
the desired result follows.
Lemma 4.18. There exist constants c1, c2 > 0 such that for any λ > 0 and for all l ∈N large
enough,
c1 < Hl,λ(1) < c2 .
Proof. By taking F = 1 in (4.31), for each ε > 0, there exists l0 ∈N sufficiently large such that for
all l > l0 and for any b > l sufficiently large and u ∈[b1/4, b3/4], it holds that
P0,u,b(M0,b(Υb,g) ≤λ) −Hl,λ(1)2u

On the other hand, from Lemma 4.12, we know that there exist constants c1, c2 > 0 such that for
b > 0 large enough and u ∈[b1/4, b3/4],

and so the conclusion follows readily.
We are now ready to prove Propositions 4.2 and 4.1 as well as Theorems A and B.
Proof of Proposition 4.2 and of Theorem B. For the proof of Proposition 4.2, by taking F = 1 in
(4.31), for any ε > 0, by taking b > l both large enough, it holds that
P0,u,b(M0,b(Υb,g) ≤λ) = (2Hl,λ(1) + εb(l))u
b ,
where liml→∞lim supb→∞|εb(l)| = 0.
By arguing in the same exact way as in the proof of
[BL18, Theorem 2.4], we get that both limits in
