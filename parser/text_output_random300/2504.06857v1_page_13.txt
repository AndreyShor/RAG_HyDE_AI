FIG. 9: Unfolded CC0π differential cross sections as a function of the muon kinematics (pµ, cos θµ), compared
against the truth-level cross sections underlying the data. Each plot contains the differential cross sections from a
specified range of the forward angle cos θµ. Error bars are the spread in results from 500 pseudo-experiments varying
systematic and statistical uncertainties, while the nominal result in each bin is the mean from those 500 unfolded
throws. Note that the highest momentum bin in each case extends up to 30 GeV, but is truncated in the plots for
readability.
