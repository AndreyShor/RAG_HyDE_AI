in the keV to MeV energy range usually can be described by a smoothly joint broken power-law
function (called the Band function4). Despite decades of intensive investigation, our understanding
of the physics behind the prompt emission of GRBs remains limited.
The existence of X-ray or gamma-ray emission and absorption lines in the GRB energy
spectrum has been debated. For example, in prompt emission phase, the Konus instrument detected
absorption lines at 30 −70 keV and emission lines at 400 −460 keV in the energy spectra of
some GRBs5,6. HEAO-1 observed absorption-like features in the spectra of some GRBs7,8. The
Japanese Ginga Gamma-Ray Burst Detector (GBD) observed two absorption-like features in three
GRBs (GRB 870303, GRB 880205 and GRB 890929), which may be interpreted as the first and
second cyclotron absorption lines9–11. Additionally, some 6.4 keV iron K-α spectral lines were
claimed to have been found in some bursts. Within the energy range of 3.8 ± 0.3 keV, a possible
transient Fe absorption feature was identified in the prompt X-ray spectrum of GRB 990705. This
feature appeared during the initial rising phase of the burst profile and disappeared thereafter12. In
another study, Frontera et al.13 analyzed the prompt emission spectrum of GRB 011211 and found
potential indications of transient Fe absorption features around 6.9 ± 0.6 keV during the rise of
the main pulse. However, the statistical significance of these features is found to be below the 5σ
threshold. Even when extending the spectral lines search to the afterglow phase and conducting
large-scale searches using X-ray detection satellites such as Chandra14, Swift X-ray Telescope15,
X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission Newton (XMM-Newton)16, Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and
Astrophysics (ASCA)17, Satellite per Astronomia X (BeppoSAX)18, no credible X-ray line feature
has been detected in GRBs afterglow19–21.
More recently, a highly significant (> 5σ) narrow emission feature around 10 MeV has been
detected in the Fermi data of GRB 221009A 22,23. These intriguing features appear during the
decay phase of the brightest pulse, with the central energy of the Gaussian distribution gradually
shifting towards lower energies over time (about 37 MeV to 6 MeV), while the ratio of the line
width to the central energy is nearly constant (about 10%). At the same time, in the Konus-
Wind data of GRB 221009A, a similar narrow emission feature has been found with a significance
level below 2σ 24. Two independent satellites simultaneously detected the narrow emission feature
in GRB 221009A, further bolstering the credibility of the narrow emission feature observed in
GRB 221009A.
In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of the prompt emission from GRB 221023A
using Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)25 data. We find a marginally significant narrow
emission feature around 2.1 MeV. The highest statistical significance of this feature is observed in
the time interval 8 −30 s, with the chance probability value < 2.56 × 10−5 (after accounting for
