Lessons from Orb-v2
Successes. Orb-v2 [28] was the first universal MLIP to demonstrate that a non-equivariant,
non-conservative architecture can perform stable Molecular Dynamics (MD) on a range of out-of-
distribution systems, whilst often obtaining qualitatively correct Radial Distribution Functions
(RDFs) relative to the PBE [2] functional it was trained on. This achievement, combined with its
superior speed compared to other universal MLIPs, and strong comprehensive benchmarking
performance [33], was a strong motivation for its continued development.
