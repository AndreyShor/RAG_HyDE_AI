The promising results from the phase matching analysis and the SHG powder measurements 
of 2-AmpH2PO3, together with the availability of single crystals of optical quality and 
sufficient size, gave the motivation to determine preliminarily coefficients

of the SHG 
tensor using the Maker fringe technique. In point group 2, the SHG tensor possesses eight 
independent coefficients, e.g. [66] (here and in the following contracted Voigt notation is used):

If Kleinman symmetry assumption [67] is valid in point group 2, four independent tensor 
coefficients would remain, with d21 = d16, d22, d23 = d34 and d14 = d25 = d36.  
For 2-AmpH2PO3 d21 = 0.25 pm/V, d22 = 0.85 pm/V, d23 = 0.15 pm/V and d14 = 0.25 pm/V. 
While for d14 Kleinman symmetry holds (and thus d14  d25  d36), this is not the case for d21 
and d23. Here, the corresponding coefficients d16 and d34 are approximately more than two times 
smaller. The coefficient d22 is remarkably large and amounts more than two times d36 of KDP 
(with d36(KDP) = 0.39 pm/V [66, 68]); unfortunately, d22 is not suitable for phase-matching 
geometries in the principal planes

4. Conclusion 
Low-temperature crystal structures have been refined for four inorganic salts of 2-
aminopyrimidine - i.e. 2-AmpH2PO3 (space group P21), (2-Amp)2SO4H2O (space group 
P21/n) and two polymorphs of 2-AmpHSO4 (both phases I and II belong to space group P21/c). 
The results obtained, which improved the conclusions of previous structural studies [23, 50, 
51], exhibit the crucial role of hydrogen bonding in the crystal packing of molecular crystals. 
The studied polymorphs of 2-AmpHSO4 with the same crystal symmetry and similar unit cell 
parameters differ entirely in the overall crystal packing. The crystal structure of 2-AmpHSO4 
(I) consists of alternating 2-Amp(1+) cations and hydrogen sulfate anions interconnected by an 
extensive network of N-H…O hydrogen bonds in contrast to the crystal structure of the 2-
AmpHSO4 (II) polymorph, which is based on chains of hydrogen sulfate anions (formed via 
O-H…O hydrogen bonds) interconnected by N-H…O interactions with centrosymmetric 
dimers of 2-Amp(1+) cations. 
The vibrational spectra of the title compounds were recorded and successfully assigned by 
combining quantum-chemical computations, complemented by the Potential Energy
