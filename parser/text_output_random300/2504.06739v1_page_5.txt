FIG. 2. δx0-dependence of rη for diﬀerent V ’s (upper panel)
and the extracted critical Vc,η’s (lower panel) with β = 400
and E0 = −5. In the lower panel there are three regions sepa-
rated by Vc,A (dashed blue line) and Vc,B (solid orange line),
representing the fully decoupled local moment phase(FLM),
fully coupled Kondo screened phase(FKS), and the genuine
selective Kondo screened phase(SKS), respectively. Note that
the shift has a period of 3 and is symmetric around δx0 = 1.5
(a0 is taken to be unit).
much larger than Vc,B, so we can examine this phase more
pertinently around the critical hybridization Vc ≡Vc,B
with the most dominating interlayer hybridization pa-
rameter V1 = V only. In order to clarify the stability of
the SKS, we now focus on this pattern starting from the
limiting situation with tf = 0 and α = 0, i.e., the f elec-
trons being exactly local and only subject to the nearest
neighbor interlayer hybridization. In this ideal situation,
the f orbital from the A-sublattice is apparently decou-
pled so that the original four-band model Hamiltonian is
reduced to an interacting three-band model involving two
c orbitals and one f orbital from the B-sublattice only.
Such situation is the B-sublattice extension of the con-
ventional two-channel single-ion Kondo impurity prob-
lem where the overscreening of a Kondo impurity may
lead to the non-Fermi liquid behavior[19, 53].
Hence
it is of particular interesting as to what extend the B-
sublattice f electrons can be screened by the semimetal-
lic bath. It is also necessary to examine the instability of
this phase under the inﬂuences of small tf and α. These
two issues are clariﬁed below numerically within the four-
band Hamiltonian.
The numerical solutions of V -dependent (rA, rB) in the
four-band Hamiltonian are plotted in Fig. 3. Generally,
we ﬁnd a nonzero critical value around Vc ≡Vc,B = 2.38
below which rA = rB = 0, implying that the f elec-
trons in both sublattices are dynamically decoupled due
to the insuﬃcient hybridization (V1 < Vc).
This re-
sult resembles to the single-ion Kondo problem[17, 54–
56], manifesting the pseudo-gap feature of the Dirac
semimetal bath. When V1 > Vc (but still much smaller
than Vc,A), on the other hand, we ﬁnd that rB increases
while rA remains zero, indicating the emergence of a gen-
uine SKS, i.e., KS occurs in one f orbital (or sublat-
tice) while Kondo breakdown in the other. This scenario
is in agreement with the one obtained from the three-
band Hamiltonian. Consequently, there is a single non-
vanishing Kondo energy scale TK (as function of V ) as-
sociated with this peculiar multiorbital phase as plotted
in Fig.4. Notice that the similar result is not accessible
within the perturbative approach in the corresponding
single-ion Kondo impurity in graphene[56], manifesting
the non-perturbative Kondo coherence in the present lat-
tice problem. Based on the present numerical result and
assuming negligible quantum ﬂuctuations, a formal path
integral approach to this SKS phase is brieﬂy illustrated
in Appendix D.

FIG. 3. Mean-ﬁeld solutions of rA (open symbols ) and rB
(ﬁlled symbols) in the A-B pattern with tc = 1, E0 = −5, β =
400 using the simpliﬁed (V1, V2) hybridization parameters. (a)
Twith ﬁxed V2 = 0 (upper panel (a)) or ﬁxed tf = 0 (lower
panel (b)). (a) V2 is ﬁxed at zero, while tf = 0, 0.15, 0.35, and
0.55. The solution of rB depends very weakly on tf and is
nonzero when V is above a critical value ∼2.3. Nonzero rA
exists only in a narrow intermediate region around V ∼3.0.
This region increases slightly with tf. Note that the rA is
multiplied by a factor of 5 for better illustration. (b) tf is
ﬁxed at zero, while α = V2/V = 0, 0.15, 0.25, and 0.4. The
solid and dash lines are quadratic ﬁtting from the last several
data points.
When tf increases from zero, we ﬁnd that Vc re-
mains almost unchanged except for a narrow region tf ∼
0.35 −0.65 where rA grows but is signiﬁcantly smaller
than rB. In this narrow region, the KS occurs with two
distinct Kondo scales (TK,A and TK,B associated with the
two respective sublattice f electrons) as shown in Fig.4.
When α = V2/V increases from zero, Vc is reduced mod-
