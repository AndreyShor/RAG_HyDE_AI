computed at NNLO QCD using the non-vanishing valence PDF determined here. The result with vanishing
charm valence is also shown for comparison. The bands correspond to one-sigma PDF uncertainties. The
projected statistical uncertainties at the EIC [267] (running at √s = 63 GeV for L = 10 fb−1) are also
shown.

the EIC (no projection for the statistical accuracy of the EIC measurement is available).
A measurement of this observable requires reconstructing final-state D-mesons by identifying
their decay products. At the future EIC this will be possible with good precision using the
proposed ePIC detector [265, 266, 267].
The predicted asymmetry Aσc¯c at Q2 = 20 GeV2 is shown in Fig. 3.23; results are shown at the
reduced charm (parton) cross-section level, evaluated with Yadism (Section 2.1.2) at NNLO
accuracy. As in Fig. 3.22, we show results obtained using the PDFs determined here, that allow
for a non-vanishing valence component, as well as the default NNPDF4.0 with c = ¯c. We also
display the projected statistical uncertainties [267] at the EIC running at √s = 63 GeV for
L = 10 fb−1. It is clear that a non-vanishing charm valence component can be measured at the
EIC to very high significance even for a moderate amount of integrated luminosity.
In addition to the charm-tagged structure function F c¯c
2 , at the EIC complementary sensitivity
to the charm valence content of the proton would be provided by the charm-tagged parity-
violating structure function xF c¯c
3 (x, Q2). This observable has the advantage that at LO is already
