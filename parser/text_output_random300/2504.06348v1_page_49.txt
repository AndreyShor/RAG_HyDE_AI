where we recall that δ is the approximation error for time-evolution. Note that in the second line we assume
an extensive scaling of volume with particle number such that Ω∼η (e.g., in a slab), and in the last line
we use |G0| ∝|G| , | ¯G| ∝|G|, |G

trunc| ≪|G|, |G|, and ηion ≤ηval. Note that when the pseudoions are not
dynamical quantum objects and are considered to be at fixed positions, we have ηion = 0 and ηval = η, such
that one recovers the scaling found in Refs. [28, 91].
Finally, the cost of coherently averaging over initial states and performing amplitude amplification (ig-
noring the one-time classical cost of developing fingerprints) for information extraction is given by Eq. (142),
giving the total complexity of our algorithm,

where we recall that |S| is the size of the initial parameter space (e.g. initial positions, velocities, etc.) over
which we average, s is the total probability that the target chemical species is formed given initial parameter
space S, ϵ is the relative error in estimating s, and we set δ ∼O(ϵ) to ensure we measure the s up to the
desired ϵ.
While it is valuable to obtain such asymptotic cost expressions, they should be used with care. Some
subroutines that are omitted as asymptotically subdominant, turn out to dominate for all of the selected
problem instances. In particular, while the state preparation scaling with the basis size is asymptotically
dominant when generic state preparation is adopted, we will see that for the case where |S| ∼1 and
typical problem instances its cost is negligible compared to the second term arising from time-evolution.27
Another clear illustration is seen in Fig. 7, where we observe that the block-encoding is dominated by PREP
subroutines of the non-local terms rather than the SWUPs, while asymptotically the cost of PREPs are
ignored due to polylogarithmic scaling in |G|. Therefore, one requires detailed constant-factor numerical
resource estimates to understand the real costs of the algorithm.
Numerical Quantum Resource Estimates for Problem Instances
We give a detailed account of quantum resource estimates for the dominant time-evolution part of our
quantum algorithm for various problem instances. Note importantly that the resource estimates we present
only refer to implementing one round of time-evolution for a given specified time t, and does not include
the multiplicative factor O(1/(√sϵ)) required for amplitude amplification. We study seven instances of the
three classes of problems introduced in Sec. 2.4, Ammonia-Boron trifluoride (NH3BF3), direct methane to
methanol (DMTM) on hexagonal boron nitride with a palladium complex, and water-gas-shift (WGS) on
Copper(100). Restating Eq. (130) for convenience, the quantum algorithm for implementing time-evolution

many times, where c ≈1.47762 is a constant (see Sec. 5.2 for details). Note that for a user-specified precision
δ, the number of calls to the iterate is dominated by the first term, which scales linearly with given time t,
and the total rescaling factor λ. The latter, an inherent figure of merit for a block-encoding, is hence crucial
in determining the overall cost and is studied in Fig. 6. It is equally as important to understand how much a
single implementation of the iterate Wsa itself costs, and so its dominant cost, given by the block-encoding
Usa, is studied in Fig. 7, with a Toffoli cost breakdown shown in detail. As discussed in Sec. 5.2, the total
gate cost for time-evolution is the cost of the iterate times the number of calls to the iterate. Then, to good
approximation, we may simply multiply the cost of Usa times the number of calls to the iterate. These total
costs are shown in Fig. 2.
We first discuss our results for the rescaling factors. In Fig. 6, we show the distribution of the rescaling
factors, λVNL, λVloc, λVel, λVion, λTel, and λTion. The sum of these numbers determines the total rescaling factor
λ. Several observations are in order. First, the cost of λTion is negligible due to suppression by the pseudoion
mass which is a factor of ∼104 −105 in the denominator of the kinetic term. Second, the contributions
27This is not necessarily the case if we are interested in the properties of large ensembles, where |S| is large and the worst case
state preparation cost is potentially large. In that case, the use of more efficient state preparation routines becomes crucial.
