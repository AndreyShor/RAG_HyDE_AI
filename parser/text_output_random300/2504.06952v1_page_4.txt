By using the mean-field approximation [43, 45], we
find the following field equations of the model

with τ3 = 1 (−1) for protons (neutrons). The densities
read
ρs = ρsp + ρsn,
(14)
ρ = ρp + ρn,
(15)
ρ3 =

The vector densities are given in terms of the respec-
tive Fermi momenta, namely, kF p,n = (3π2ρp,n)1/3, and
the proton fraction is yp = ρp/ρ. One of the effects of
the attractive interaction induced by the σ field is the
change the nucleon mass by making it an in-medium
quantity written as
M ∗= Mnuc −gσσ.
(18)
In the above expressions, σ, ω0, b0(3) are the mean-field
values of the respective mesonic fields.
Concerning the thermodynamical quantities of the
system, the energy density and pressure are obtained
from the energy-momentum tensor, T µν, calculated from
Eq. (9). These expressions read

In order to fully describe the stellar matter on the
hadronic side, we take into account the beta equilibrium
condition in a system with electrons and muon added
to the hadrons. They are given by
ρp −ρe = ρµ,
(21)
and
µn −µp = µe = µµ.
(22)
In this context, the expressions for energy density and
pressure are modified to
εβ = εhad + µ4

The final terms in the above equations account for the
thermodynamic contributions of massless electrons and
muons, where the muon mass is mµ = 105.7 MeV. The
chemical potentials of these leptons, µe and µµ, are re-
lated to their respective number densities through the
relations ρe = µ3
e/(3π2) and ρµ = [(µ2
µ−m2
µ)3/2]/(3π2).
Furthermore, the hadronic part of the compact star
described in this work is divided into two regions: the
outer crust and the inner crust (IC). The outer crust is
described using the equations derived by Baym, Pethick,
and Sutherland (BPS) [61], which are used within the
density range of 6.3×10−12 fm−3 ⩽ρ ⩽2.5×10−4 fm−3.
For the inner crust, we assume a polytropic equation of
state relating pressure and energy density as
pIC = A + Bε4/3
IC
(25)
This expression is matched to both the BPS equation
for the outer crust and the equation of state given by
the RMF model. In particular, the connection between
the inner crust and the matter described by the RMF
model occurs at the core-crust transition, where the
transition pressure and energy density are determined
using the thermodynamical method [62–64].

4.1 Hadron-quark phase transition and stability
analysis
We develop the hybrid EoS under the assumption that
the interface between hadrons and quarks is a sharp
discontinuity, modeled by means of the Maxwell con-
struction. In other words, at zero temperature, the pres-
sure and chemical potential remain equal on both sides
of the phase transition boundary. With this goal, we
combine various parameterizations of the holographic
model D3-D7, described in Sect. 2, with a fixed RMF
model shown in Sect. 3 (NL3*). In Table 1, we can
observe the parameters related to phase transitions,
