type of energy storage element—RC or RL circuits—which
represent canonical examples of LTI relaxation systems [8].
These classical results naturally extend to spatially dis-
tributed systems by considering an inﬁnite transmission line
composed of resistors and capacitors periodically arranged
along a spatial axis. Figure 1 illustrates the schematic of
such an inﬁnite distributed RC transmission line. Taking the
spatial discretization interval ∆x →0, this discrete electri-
cal network is precisely governed by the one-dimensional
diffusion equation [9], i.e.
C ∂
∂tV (t, x) = 1
R
∂2
∂x2 V (t, x) + I(t, x),
(1)
where V (t, x) is the voltage across the capacitor and I(t, x)
is the applied current at time t and position x. Introducing
the variables y(t, x) = V (t, x), u(t, x) = I(t, x)/C, and the
diffussion coefﬁcient α = 1/RC, the latter simpliﬁes to the
standard (heat) diffusion equation
∂
∂ty(t, x) = α ∂2
∂x2 y(t, x) + u(t, x).
(2)
The explicit solution of (2), see, e.g., [10], is given by the
convolution
y(t, x) =
Z t

g(t −τ, x −ξ)u(τ, ξ) dξdτ
(3)
where g is the so-called heat kernel given by
g(t, x) =

4αt .
(4)
The heat kernel clearly exhibits the relaxation property spa-
tially. In particular, Figure 2a illustrates the spatial proﬁle of
(4) at various times t. It shows the relaxation property, as the
spatial proﬁle ﬂattens monotonically towards equilibrium as
t increases. However, Figure 2b shows the kernel’s temporal
behavior at a ﬁxed location, highlighting that the kernel is
not a completely monotone function in time, as one might
expect from a classical LTI relaxation system.
This apparent discrepancy is resolved by examining the
spatial Fourier transform of the diffusion equation (2), which
yields the inﬁnite family of decoupled LTI systems
∂
∂t ˆy(t, ω) = −αω2ˆy(t, ω) + ˆu(t, ω)
(5)
parameterized by the frequency variable ω. The impulse
response of the latter is given by
ˆg(t, ω) = e−αω2t.
(6)
In this frequency domain representation, each mode ω in-
dividually deﬁnes an LTI system whose impulse response

is completely monotone in time. Thus, the diffusion equa-
tion deﬁnes an inﬁnite-dimensional system that can be de-
composed into an inﬁnite family of ﬁnite-dimensional LTI
relaxation systems.
The diffusion process provides a clear physical connection
from classical relaxation theory to its inﬁnite-dimensional,
spatially extended counterpart. This is further reinforced by
the recent work [11], where it is explicitly demonstrated that
the spatial discretization of the diffusion equation leads to a
ﬁnite-dimensional LTI relaxation system. In this paper, we
will extend the theory of LTI relaxation systems to a class
of LTSI system, with the diffusion process as a canonical
example of an LTSI relaxation system.

III. NOTATION AND PRELIMINARIES
We use mostly standard notation. We denote the sets
of nonnegative real numbers and integers by R+ and Z+,
respectively. We denote the inner-product on a (complex)
Hilbert space X by ⟨·, ·⟩X and the induced norm by ∥·∥X.
We omit the subscript if X = Cn or there is no risk of
ambiguity. We denote the Banach space of bounded linear
operators from X to another Hilbert space Y by B(X, Y),
and the operator norm by ∥·∥. We use the shorthand notation
B(X, X) = B(X). We also consider unbounded linear
operators A : D(A) →Y, where D(A) ⊂X is the domain
of A. We say that A is densely deﬁned if D(A) ⊂X is
dense. If A is densely deﬁned, then it has an adjoint A∗:
D(A∗) →X, where D(A∗) ⊂Y is closed. We say that A
is self-adjoint if D(A) = D(A∗) and ⟨Ax, y⟩= ⟨x, Ay⟩for
all x, y ∈D(A). We say that a self-adjoint A is nonnegative
if ⟨Ax, x⟩≥0 for all x ∈D(A), and we write A ≥0 to
indicate that A is self-adjoint and nonnegative.
A. Square integrable functions and the Fourier transform
We denote the Hilbert space of square integrable functions
from a domain X to a Hilbert space X by L2(X, X), where
⟨f, g⟩L2(X,X ) =
Z

⟨f(x), g(x)⟩X dx

function ˆf : Rs →Cn given by

It is well-known [12] that the Fourier transform converges for
absolutely integrable functions. Due to Plancherel’s theorem,
