Figure 2: Simulation of teenage pregnancy in an agent-based model using a
cusp catastrophe surface. Left: all agents (represented as blue markers) are in
a non-pregnant state, positioned according to non-catastrophic fertility factors
(X-axis) and catastrophic shocks (Z-axis), such as deprivation and violence.
Right: After the ABM simulation, some agents (red markers) have transitioned
into a pregnant state, triggered by an increase in catastrophic shocks (Z-axis)
or decreases in non-catastrophic factors (X-axis).
negative external factors such as socioeconomic deprivation, violence, and
substance abuse, which are not immediately strong enough to trigger pregnancy
in the initial state. The Y-axis represents the fertility rate, which is initially low
or neutral for all agents, indicating stability in terms of pregnancy prevention.
Figure 2 (left) highlights a relatively stable system where the agents are
unlikely to get pregnant due to a combination of effective contraceptive use
and low exposure to catastrophic factors. According to the catastrophe theory,
the agents are positioned on the stable part of the cusp surface, where minor
changes in conditions would not result in significant shifts in pregnancy status.
However, after the ABM Simulation (Figure 2 right), some teenagers (agents
represented by red markers) transition into the pregnant state. These agents
experienced a catastrophic shift due to the cumulative effects of deprivation, vi-
olence, and substance abuse, pushing them over the cusp. The cusp catastrophe
model shows a bifurcation region where small changes in the control parameters
(non-catastrophic factors and catastrophic shocks) can lead to abrupt and
significant changes in the pregnancy state (Y-axis). This explains why some
agents, initially stable, suddenly became pregnant, caused, for example, by peer
