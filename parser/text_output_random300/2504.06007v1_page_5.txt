CAMulator
4. Global total atmospheric energy conservation scheme: The global atmospheric energy budget is defined as
the balance between the tendency of total atmospheric energy and net energy fluxes at the top of the atmosphere
and the surface. At each forecast step, Temperature is corrected to ensure that the sum of total atmospheric
energy tendencies aligns with the net energy sources and sinks over the past 6-hour period.
Corrections to surface pressure, total precipitation, and air temperature are applied using multiplicative ratios across all
grid cells, computed dynamically at each time step. While this approach enforces conservation, there are no explicit
safeguards against overcorrection and no effort to redistribute values in the nonnegative correction, which may warrant
further investigation in future work. We test the model in configurations with and without the physics blocks activated
(CAMulator-phys and CAMulator-nophys, respectively).
It is essential to apply these conservation schemes in the specified order to preserve the theoretical dependencies
between mass, moisture, and energy conservation. Further technical details are provided in Appendix B.

Training
CAMulator was trained in a staged approach to balance stability and conservation constraints. Initially, the model
was trained for 113 epochs as a single-step (6-hour) prediction task, minimizing the latitude-weighted mean squared
error (MSE), with conservation block layers entirely omitted to allow for more stable initial learning. After this phase,
conservation layers were introduced, and training continued for 77 additional epochs, now as a two-step (12-hour)
forecast task. In the two-step training, the loss from both forecasted states was accumulated and used to optimize the
model weights. For the single-step pretraining, cosine-annealing schedules were applied with an initial learning rate of
1E −5. Both stages used latitude-weighted MSE as a loss function, the AdamW optimizer [Loshchilov, 2017], and
batch sizes of 32. The training was conducted using Pytorch on 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, each with 40 GB of memory
[Paszke et al., 2019]. In this phase final model state trained for 190 epochs in total over the course of three days.
To determine the final model weights, we conducted a validation cycle, which consisted of training on 500 samples
followed by a ten-year simulation. The resulting climatology was then compared to an archived CAM6 climatology.
This process was repeated after each training iteration to assess the model’s ability to capture the climatology of
precipitation and 2-meter temperature. The final model was selected based on latitude-weighted mean squared error
(RMSE), ensuring the closest match to the CAM6 climatology for these two fields. The 50th cycle was selected as our
final model, which took an additional 12 hours of training.

Climate Forecast Inference Options
We explore multiple inference configurations, each defined by the forcing applied to the SST field, while all other
dynamic forcing variables remain unchanged. The following four SST scenarios are considered:
1. Observed SSTs (1979–2014) – Uses monthly historical SST values from this period as in the CAM6
simulations
2. Year 2000 Climatological SST – Applies the mean SST state from the year 2000, held constant throughout
the simulation.
3. Year 2000 +2K Climatological SST – Uses the year 2000 SST climatology, with a uniform and instantaneous
+2K temperature increase applied globally to the SST field.
4. Year 2000 +4K Climatological SST – Uses the year 2000 SST climatology, with a uniform and instantaneous
+4K temperature increase applied globally to the SST field.
For every SST case, the monthly sea surface values are linearly interpolated to a 6-hour timestep. In the 1979–2014
observed SST case, the simulation continuously cycles through these years, allowing for realistic variability. In contrast,
climatological SST scenarios (year 2000, +2K, and +4K) can be extended indefinitely, making them well-suited
for exploring equilibrium climate responses under different baseline ocean conditions. We note that the model was
trained exclusively on the 1979–2010 SST state, making the remaining two inference cases (Year 2000+2K, and +4K
climatological SSTs) entirely out-of-sample predictions. To ensure diverse initial conditions, we introduce a stochastic
kinetic energy backscatter scheme [Berner et al., 2009] for the first 15 days to the 1979–2014 SST runs, allowing the
model to reach an independent atmospheric state by week 2. This approach mirrors the initialization strategy used in
CAM6 simulations, where initial temperature perturbations help generate distinct trajectories [Kay et al., 2015].
