Fig. 1 | Transport phase diagram of the high quality 3.83° tMoTe2 device. a, Schematic of 
the triple-gated tMoTe2 device used for transport measurements. b, Calculated band structure 
of 3.89° tMoTe2, where the black line represents the results from the continuum model, the blue 
dots correspond to the DFT bands and the red dashed line indicates the energy of the van Hove 
singularity. c,d, Longitudinal resistivity ρxx as a function of electric displacement field D and 
moiré hole filling factor νh at T = 2 K (c) and T = 900 mK (d), measured at B = 0. e,f, 
Symmetrized ρxx (e) and anti-symmetrized ρxy (f) under B = ±0.1 T, as a function of D and νh at 
T = 100 mK. The black regions in d-f are experimentally inaccessible, either due to their highly 
insulating nature or contact issues. Dashed lines in c-f indicate the correlated and/or topological 
quantum states that emerge at commensurate moiré fillings.
