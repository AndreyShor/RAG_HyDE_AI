We utilize the ocean potential temperature and surface air temperature at 2 m from models. The 
ocean heat content (OHC) in the upper 2,000m is obtained by vertically integrating the temperature 
field and multiplying by reference values of density (1,025 kgm-3) and specific heat (4,000 J kg-1 
K-1). Model drift in OHC is removed by subtracting a cubic polynomial fit based on the 
preindustrial control run over its full length in time for each model (Irving et al., 2020). All model 
output has been interpolated to a regular 1° × 1° grid.  
 
2.3 Ocean Heat Uptake Efficiency 
Ocean Heat Uptake Efficiency (OHUE) is defined as: 
        𝑂𝐻𝑈𝐸 = 
∆𝑁
∆𝑇

where ∆N is the global-mean rate of ocean heat uptake, and ∆T is the global-mean surface air 
temperature change (GMST). The unit of OHUE is in W m⁻² K⁻¹, representing the efficiency with 
which the ocean absorbs heat relative to changes in GMST. We use the long-term trend of upper 
2,000 m ocean heat content as introduced above to estimate ∆N. This approach is based on the 
assumption that nearly all the heat storage change occurs within the upper 2,000 m which allows 
for a comparison between observations and models. The results presented in the main text are 
based on a 20-year window for calculating the OHC tendency. We also conduct a sensitivity test 
varying the length of the window. The OHC and GMST are bulk global metrics. We further apply 
this approach to access the contributions from different external forcings and regions (see Sections 
3.2, 3.3).  
 
3 Results 
3.1 Historical Evolution of Ocean Heat Uptake Efficiency 
The historical ocean heat uptake efficiencies (OHUE), obtained over two-decade time windows 
from observations and CMIP6 historical runs, are shown in Figure 1a. The OHUE from 
observations is within the range of 0.4–1.0 W m⁻² K⁻¹. The spread of results based on the Green’s 
Function (GF) method is approximately 0.3–1.3 W m⁻² K⁻¹, influenced by the choice of SST 
patterns and the prior estimate of the GF. The simulated OHUE from 7 models with large-ensemble 
simulations is found to be approximately 0.3-1.0 W m⁻² K⁻¹, and matches the observed OHUE 
magnitude. The historical OHUE in this study is consistent with previous estimates based on 
observations and models (Cael, 2022; Kuhlbrodt & Gregory, 2012; Newsom et al., 2023; Sohail 
et al., 2023). 
Importantly, there is a remarkable variation in OHUE over recent decades (Figure 1a): the value 
is relatively low during the late 1980s, rose to peak around the year 2000 at 0.8 W m⁻² K⁻¹ from 
GF, and then decreased back to around 0.6 W m⁻² K⁻¹ by 2011 (i.e. 2001-2020 period). It indicates
