This is further studied by a 1-loop analysis at low energies, employing four channels of
breaking the SO(10) down to the SM of Elementary Particles. Estimates of all breaking
scales from the Planck scale down to the EW scale are calculated.
Finally, the observation potential of each breaking channel in experiments that search for
gravitational wave signals and proton decay is examined, following past analyses. Two of the
channels are excluded by proton lifetime bounds. One of the two surviving ones produces
cosmic strings that emit a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background signal and
thus has the best chances of observation.
