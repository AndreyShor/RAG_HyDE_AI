Remark 1.2. As a consequence of (K1) – (K2), the Fourier transform bK is a probability measure with
a smooth density and admitting moments of all orders. In particular, the Hessian D2K(0) at the origin
is strictly negative definite in the sense that there exists δ > 0 such that, for any v ∈Rd, one has
⟨v, D2K(0)v⟩≤−δ|v|2.
Definition 1.3. For ξ a space-time white noise on Rd × R+, we define the ⋆-scale invariant field
with seed covariance K by
X(·)
def=
Z
Rd
Z ∞
0
K(er(y −·))e
dr
2 ξ(dy, dr) .
(1.2)
Furthermore, for 0 ≤s < t, we let Xs,t be the field on Rd given by
Xs,t(·)
def=
Z
Rd
Z t
s
K(er(y −·))e
dr
2 ξ(dy, dr) ,
(1.3)
with the notational convention that X0,t = Xt.
For t ≥0, the fields X and Xt have the following covariance structures, for all x, y ∈Rd,
E[X(x)X(y)] =
Z ∞
0
K(er(x −y))dr ,
E[Xt(x)Xt(y)] =
Z t
0
K(er(x −y))dr .
(1.4)
Clearly E[X(x)2] = ∞, so X can only be realised as a random Schwartz distribution. The collection
of fields (Xt)t≥0 is called the martingale approximation of X. Indeed, by construction, (Xt)t≥0 is a
martingale for the filtration (Ft)t≥0 given by
Ft
def= σ(Xs : s ∈[0, t)) .
(1.5)
Moreover, as t →∞the field Xt converges almost surely to X in the space H−κ
loc (Rd) for any κ > 0.
The three phases of GMC measures. As previously mentioned, GMC measures exhibit three
distinct phases depending on the value of the parameter γ > 0 in (1.1). Each phase is characterised
by the specific form of renormalisation required to obtain a nontrivial limiting measure.
In the subcritical regime, i.e., when γ ∈(0, γc), the sequence of random measures
µγ,t(dx) = eγXt(x)−γ2
2 tdx
(1.6)
converges weakly in probability to a limiting positive random measure µγ as t →0 [Kah85,RV14,
Sha16,Ber17], which is almost surely nontrivial. It is well-known that µγ is almost surely non-atomic,
but singular with respect to Lebesgue measure. Many further properties of these measures concerning,
among others, moments and multifractal behaviour are known [RV14,Ber23]. An important feature
of the measure µγ is that it is carried by the set of γ-thick points. Intuitively, a thick point is a point
where the field takes an unusually large value: one where it is of the order of its variance instead of
the order of its standard deviation.
When γ ≥γc a phase transition occurs and if one considers the sequence of measures defined in (1.6),
then for any compact subset A ⊂Rd, it holds that µγ,t(A) →0 in probability as t →0. Therefore,
in order to define a nontrivial limiting measure at the critical threshold γc, one needs to give the
sequence of approximating measures an extra “push” in the right direction. More precisely, in the
critical regime, i.e., when γ = γc, the sequence of random measures
µγc,t(dx) = (−Xt(x) + γc t)eγc Xt(x)−γc2
2 tdx
(1.7)
converges weakly in probability as t →∞to a limiting positive random measure µγc [DRSV14a,
DRSV14b,Pow21], which is non-atomic and has full support. The normalisation used in (1.7) is
known as the “derivative normalisation” since it can be obtained by evaluating at γ = γc the derivative
with respect to γ of the expression on the right-hand side of (1.6).
