This is of course nothing but the fundamental period of the mirror quintic [1].
In the second limit, z →1, we observe that the complexiﬁed volume of the exceptional
curves that resolve nodes of Type B is again trivial. However, the curves Cp for p ∈Sr,A
1
, that
resolve nodes of Type A, measure a non-trivial B-ﬁeld holonomy 1/2 that prevents us from
deforming those nodes as well. Note that the holonomy of 1/2 is precisely compatible with
the fact that, after the transition to b
X, the homology class of the curves becomes 2-torsion.
Taking again the regularized limit we ﬁnd the corresponding mirror fundamental period

This is annihilated by the Picard-Fuchs operator AESZ 203 (B.1). We can therefore interpret
this operator as annihilating the periods of the mirror of the almost generic nodal quintic X1
that is equipped with a ﬂat but topologically non-trivial B-ﬁeld [1]2 ∈B(X1).

The mirror transition of the conifold transition b

Again we ﬁnd that in the limit z →1/3 this can be regularized to yield the fundamental

that is annihilated by the Picard-Fuchs operator AESZ 222 (B.28). We can therefore interpret
this as corresponding to the mirror of the Calabi-Yau background (X2, [1]2). 14
14We have introduced an additional sign for w in the transition in order to directly reproduce AESZ 222.
At the level of the torsion reﬁned GV-invariants, the only consequence is that the Z2-charges of curves of odd
degree in b
X2 are ﬂipped.
