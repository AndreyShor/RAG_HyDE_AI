Figure 4. Projection plots as Fig. 3, but zoomed in to a radius of 1 kpc. At this scale, the gas properties exhibit
more complex and detailed structures, and demonstrate strong correlation with the instantaneous AGN luminosity.
At high accretion rates, high-density cool gas accretes onto the center, triggering high-velocity cold winds exceeding
104 km/s that shock-heat the ambient medium to temperatures approaching 108 K. During low accretion periods, both
gas densities and temperatures decrease significantly, and the gas motions become milder and more turbulent.
dicated by the white central dot) becomes visible.
The gas properties at this scale reveal complicated
structures that exhibit strong temporal correlation
with AGN activity.
During periods of high BH
accretion (𝑡= 57 Myr and 444 Myr), high-density
cool gas forms at the vicinity of the central black
hole via thermal instability, and accretes onto the
center, triggering high-velocity cold winds exceed-
ing 104 km/s that shock-heat the ambient medium
to temperatures approaching 108 K.
Conversely,
during low accretion periods, both gas densities
and temperatures decrease significantly, indicating
a more quiescent state. The velocity field demon-
strates complex dynamics characterized by simulta-
neous inflows, outflows, and turbulent motions, and
cool gas manifests as clumpy or spiral-structured
filaments falling toward the central regions. These
results highlight the close coupling between AGN
feedback and gas dynamics near the Bondi radius,
which critically determines both the black hole ac-
cretion rate and subsequent feedback modes. No-
tably, unlike the large-scale properties, gas condi-
tions at 𝑟∼1 kpc exhibit strong correlation with
instantaneous AGN luminosity.
Fig. 5 presents an azimuthal perspective within
5 kpc radius to reveal feedback structures. To iden-
tify the dominant feedback mechanisms, we look
at the spatial distribution of the mass tracers (plots
are not shown for the sake of brevity), which are
passive scalars that are injected into the computa-
tional domain by the AGN cold winds, AGN hot
winds, SN feedback, etc., respectively.
By ex-
amining the spatial concentration of these tracers,
we can identify the dominant feedback mechanism
driving gas flows across different regions of the
galaxy and at various times. During high accretion
episodes (𝑡= 57 Myr and 444 Myr), cold-mode
AGN feedback drives high-velocity (> 104 km/s),
low-density winds in bi-conical regions, generat-
ing prominent shock fronts at the wind-ISM inter-
face. During low accretion periods (𝑡= 166 Myr,
302 Myr, and 902 Myr), hot AGN winds dominate
