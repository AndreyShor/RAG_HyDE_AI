For z = p we found that the minimum time quantum
δτz=p is actually limited. Nevertheless, we have seen that
this limit can be arbitrarily reduced by taking an arbi-
trarily large z + 1 > p and we showed that the bound
on the minimum time quantum tends to zero in the limit
z →∞. Thus, we indicated the conditions under which
to safely take a continuous ﬂow of time. When consid-
ering the minimum resolvable time interval, we derived
the inequality (20), in agreement with previous analysis
performed to search for a limit in the accuracy of a time
measurement [1–5]. In introducing relativistic arguments
we adopted the SW framework, where clocks and light
signals are used to measure spacetime intervals between
events [13, 14], together with a gravitational consistency
condition requiring that the clock cannot be localized
within its own Schwarzschild radius.
Finally we discussed the generalization of our frame-
work to the (more physical) case of clock with generic
spectrum. In this new scenario we can not ﬁnd a sub-
set of p + 1 time states that are orthogonal, meaning
that the time observable can only be described by the
POVM. Nevertheless, also in this case we found the limit
in the discretization of the time values when they are
discrete and we show again how to safely take the limit
z →∞leading to a continuous ﬂow of time. Then we
addressed the question of the minimal resolvable time
interval achievable by the generalized quantum clock.
It is important to emphasize that this work does not
aim to propose a realizable clock, but rather to iden-
tify fundamental limits on the structure and resolution
of time values of a speciﬁc proposal of quantum clock
[10–12], when it is constrained by the interplay between
quantum mechanics and general relativity. The derived
bounds are not engineering prescriptions, but theoretical
constraints that deﬁne the boundary of what is physically
consistent when both quantum uncertainty and gravita-
tional eﬀects are taken into account.
As already mentioned, the time observable we studied
in this work ﬁnds a suitable physical justiﬁcation (and is
thus widely used) within the Page and Wootters quantum
time formalism [15, 16]. The key diﬀerence between such
theory and ordinary quantum mechanics is that in Page
and Wootters framework time is not a classical parameter
disconnected from the dynamics of the quantum system.
Rather time is a quantum degree of freedom which be-
longs to an ancillary Hilbert space and, in such space,
it is represented by a clock observable. The Page and
Wootters theory is thus a protocol for internalizing the
temporal reference frame, leading to a new conception
of quantum time where the time observable plays a cen-
tral role. In the quantum gravity literature, it has been
suggested that quantum reference frames are needed to
formulate a workable quantum theory of gravity [28–31].
We hope that our discussion will be useful in this regard
but we do not go further into the topic, since it is beyond
the scope of the present work.
