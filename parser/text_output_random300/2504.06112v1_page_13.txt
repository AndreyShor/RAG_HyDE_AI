in the entire system. Fig. 6(a) depicts this observable as a function of µ, for fixed σ = 0.2.
Consistently, cooperation is higher in SDG relative to PDG, along the whole range of µ.
In the medium to low range of µ, the gap is wider and, but with increasing µ, the gap is
narrowed as cooperation is adopted in the entire system. We can observe how the effect of
the social coupling parameter is to unify the adoption of cooperation in both sets of players.
When exploring the cooperation fraction with respect to σ in Fig. 6(b), the same qualitative
