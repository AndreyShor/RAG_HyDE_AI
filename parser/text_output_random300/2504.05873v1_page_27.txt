Figure 9: Bounds derived from E137 using different types of couplings to electrons (top-
left), muons (top-right), tau leptons (bottom-left) and universal couplings to all leptons
(bottom-right).
For clarity, only the contributions coming from DB and Primakoff production are shown,
but not the positron annihilation processes. For ALP masses ma ≲100 MeV, the agreement
of the bounds between all couplings is close to perfect. However, for larger masses, the
differences between the couplings become evident. While the lower bounds on the derivative
coupling remain relatively constant until reaching the tip, the pseudoscalar bounds are
weaker for the higher ALP mass range.
The derivative and pseudoscalar couplings perfectly match their respective constant
approximations. This is unsurprising, especially at the tip of the plot, as the ALP mass is
much larger than the electron mass, making eq. (5.1) an excellent approximation for the
effective photon coupling in the derivative basis. Similarly, the fact that the bound for the
pseudoscalar coupling can be reproduced by setting the loop-induced photon coupling to
zero agrees with the expectation from eq. (2.18), as the effective photon coupling in the
pseudoscalar basis is strongly suppressed by the electron mass.
We note that this excellent agreement between the approximated couplings and the
exact couplings is still present at the very left side of the plot, where ma ≈10 MeV and
the approximation τ ≪1 starts to become invalid. This agreement can be explained by
