Figure 5: Two-dimensional four-wave mixing signal for the static part with the variation of ionic 
strength a)0.000001 M, b)0.00005 M, and c) 0.005M. Which clearly shows both phase and inten- 
sity change. As at low ionic strength, phase ϕ goes to π/2 hence as a whole signal decreases. At 
intermediate ionic strength intensity is high with distinct phase compared to higher concentration
