It follows that our result is consistent with Bonnet’s theorem in that the particle velocity
v in the two centre forces is given by
v2 = v2
1 + v2

force due to just one of the two centres. Namely,

For the existence of our quantum spiral converging to our two-centre ellipse the crucial
condition is the quantum Liouville condition alluded to earlier, taking into account the
last few remarks.
2.3. Semi-Classical Analysis of Two Gravitational Centres with a Central Linear
Restoring Force
The above approach can be used to examine the motion of a particle P subject to the
force of two fixed gravitational centres and a central linear restoring force. Needless
to say such a force results from an all-enveloping spherically symmetric gravitational
cloud. In the (ξ, η) coordinates the potential field for this system is given by
