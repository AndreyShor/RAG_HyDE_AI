Below, we work with the BLS. Recall that we use LD to denote the BLS in D with intensity
α, and let ε ≤s ≤r. We write Ls for the set of loops in LD that are contained in Bs. We first
introduce some notions for deterministic objects. For any loop configuration Ls in Bs, we can define
the quality associated with Ls as follows, where for any set A ⊂C and any loop configuration L,
we use Λ(A, L) to denote the union of A and all the clusters in L that intersect A. We say that
(η1, η2) is an admissible pair of excursions in Bs if Λ(η1, Ls) and Λ(η2, Ls) both intersect Bε, but
they do not intersect each other. If we denote the starting and ending points of ηi by xi and yi,
respectively, we say that the admissible pair (η1, η2) is δ-separated (at scale s) if
Λ(η1 ∪Bδs(x1) ∪Bδs(y1), Ls) ∩(η2 ∪Bδs(x2) ∪Bδs(y2)) = ∅.
(4.1)
Furthermore, we say that (γ1, γ2) is a δ-good pair of loops (at scale s) if each γi contains an
excursion ηi such that (η1, η2) is a δ-separated admissible pair, and Λ(γ1, Ls) ∩Λ(γ2, Ls) = ∅. Note
that if (γ1, γ2) is a δ-good pair of loops, then it is δ′-good for all δ′ ∈(0, δ).
Given the loop configuration Ls in Bs, we consider the extension probability across s (from ε)
by δ-good pairs of loops in L2s \ Ls (i.e., the loop soup at the next scale), which is defined as
ms(δ; ε, Ls) = P
 
there is a δ-good pair of loops (γ1, γ2) in L2s \ Ls such that the two clusters in
Ls ∪(L2s \ Ls) containing γ1 and γ2, respectively, are disjoint and outermost

.
(4.2)
Since ms(δ; ε, Ls) is decreasing in δ, the following quality at scale s is well-defined:
Qε(Ls) := sup{δ ∈[0, 1/4] : ms(δ; ε, Ls) ≥δ}.
(4.3)
Then, our separation lemma for loop-soup clusters can be stated as follows, in terms of the above-
mentioned quality.
Lemma 4.3. For all α ∈(0, 1/2], there exist constants u, c > 0 such that for all 0 < 2ε < r < 1/2,
P(Qε(Lr) ≥u) ≥c P(E2(ε, r)).

Summary of corresponding results in [13] for BLS
We now state continuous versions of several key results that were derived in [13] in the discrete
setting, including various separation lemmas, a locality property, and a quasi-multiplicativity upper
bound. Since they can all be established in a similar way as in [13], we refer the reader to that
paper and skip the proofs. These properties will be used in the derivation of the separation lemma
for CLE.
Separation lemma.
We start with a version of separation lemma for Brownian motions inside
a BLS. The setup is analogous to that of Proposition 4.7 in [13]. Let Lε be a loop configuration
in Bε. Let V1 and V2 be two disjoint subsets of Bε, which both intersect ∂Bε. Let j, k ≥1. Let
¯x = (x1, . . . , xj) be a vector of j vertices in V1 ∩∂Bε and ¯y = (y1, . . . , yk) be a vector of k vertices
in V2 ∩∂Bε (some of the points in ¯x may coincide, and similarly with ¯y). We view the quintuple
(Lε, V1, V2, ¯x, ¯y) as an initial configuration, and we restrict to the case when Λ(V1, Lε) ∩V2 = ∅.
For ε ≤s ≤r, let Π1
s (resp. Π2
s) be the union of j (resp. k) independent Brownian motions started,
respectively, from each of the j points in ¯x (resp. each of the k points in ¯y), and stopped upon
