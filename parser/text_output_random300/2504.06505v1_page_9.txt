ultimately destabilizing the simulation process.  Therefore, we employed differential learning rates, 
assigning a larger learning rate to parameters such as mass and friction coefficients to accelerate the training 
process, while applying a smaller learning rate to potential parameters to prevent instability. Furthermore, 
the gradients of potential parameters were exclusively calculated using partial backpropagation to ensure 
stability.  Together, these strategies stabilize training and enable reliable convergence. 
III. Results 
To illustrate our method, we investigate this method by building a CG model of liquid water 
molecules. More specifically, we applied the dynamic matching method to learn from the AA simulation 
of water. In our experience, the simulation is performed with SPC/E water model37 within a 2 nm box with 
periodic boundary conditions. The Langevin integration was used to simulate the constant  NPT ensemble 
with temperature 300 K and pressure 1 bar. An integration step of 2 fs was used, and the structures were 
saved every 10 steps. The equilibrium run was performed for 100 ns following the energy minimization. A 
100 ns trajectory was collected as the data that the dynamic matching method will learn from to build the 
CG model. The CG map was defined as the center of mass (COM) of each water molecule.  
The equilibrium properties we focused on were the radial distribution function (RDF) and angular 
distribution function (ADF) functions. The RDF is defined as: 
  
𝑔(𝑟) =
I
J& 〈∑∑
𝛿(𝑟−𝑟KL)
LMK
K
〉, 
  (8) 
where 𝑟KL = ‖𝑹K −𝑹L‖ is the pairwise distance, 𝑁 is the number of particles, 𝑉 is the volume of the 
simulation box, and I and J are indices of particles. The ADF is defined as: 
 
𝑝(𝜃) =
+
N 〈∑∑
∑
𝛿(𝜃−𝜃KLF)
FOL
LMK
K
〉, 
(9) 
where 𝑊 is a normalization factor to ensure 𝑝(𝜃) is normalized and 𝜃KLF represents the angle form angle 
formed by particles 𝐼, 𝐽, and 𝐾 which are neighbours. A cutoff of 4.5 Å is used to determine the neighbor 
list. Compared with the RDF, the ADF provides additional structural information by capturing the three-
body correlation of neighboring particles. 
Figures 3(a)-(b) (Brownian dynamics) and 4(a)-(b) (Langevin dynamics) compare the 
thermodynamic properties of CG models against their mapped atomistic models. Both the RDF and ADF 
of the randomly initialized CG models exhibit significant deviations from the AA simulation benchmarks. 
However, after optimization using the dynamic matching framework, all CG models converge consistently 
to the AA reference data. This demonstrates that the optimized CG models accurately reproduce the 
structural spatial correlations inherent in the AA systems.
