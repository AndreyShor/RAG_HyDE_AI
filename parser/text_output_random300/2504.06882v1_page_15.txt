FIG. S4: Brillouin zone of (a) k-space Pc, (b) k-space Cc, (c) k-space Pca21.
Here, the 2D sub-manifolds X1,2 and the oriented segments S+
1,2 are illustrated in Fig. S4(c). The sub-manifold X1
has the topology of a Klein bottle under the action of Gy, so the Z2-invariant ν(2)
1
is well-defined.
On the other hand, we can also define a Z2-invariant over half of the kx-kz plane, since the glide reflection Gx gives
it a Klein bottle topology. However, for the planes where ky = 0 or ky = π, the other glide reflection Gy acts as a
half-translation symmetry along the kx direction. It assumes the periodic boundary conditions along the kx direction
as imposed by reciprocal translation along the kx direction. This leads to the definition of ν(2)
2 . Meanwhile, the Z2
invariant defined on half of the plane equals to 2ν(2)
2
and therefore must be trivial.
Second amphidicosm M4
The momentum space Bieberbach group corresponding to the second amphidicosm is Pna21. We assume the action
of the point group D2 = {E, Gx, Gy, GxGy} on momentum space is given by:
Gx : (kx, ky, kz) →(−kx, ky + 1
2Gy, kz + 1
2Gz),
Gy : (kx, ky, kz) →(kx + 1
2Gx, −ky, kz).

The reduced K group eK(M4) is isomorphic to Z4. The Z4-invariant is defined over the plane ky = kz, as follows:

Here, the 2D sub-manifold X and the oriented segment S+ are illustrated in Fig. S5(a). This is the case that has
been introduced in the main text.
The glide reflection symmetry Gy acts on the planes ky = 0 or ky = π as a
half-translation along the kx-direction, assuming periodic boundary conditions along the kx-direction, as imposed by
the reciprocal translation along kx. The two glide reflection symmetries Gx and Gy act nontrivially on the boundary
∂X of X, specifically on the two kx-edges. The fundamental domain ∂X/G is half of an edge with an orientation, and
we may choose it as the oriented segment S+, as indicated in Fig. S5(a). Thus, the topological invariants is given by
Eq. (S61).
Dicosm M5
The momentum space Bieberbach group corresponding to the Dicosm is P21. We assume the action of the point
group C2 = {E, R2} on momentum space is given by:
R2 : (kx, ky, kz) →(−kx, −ky, kz + 1
2Gz).
