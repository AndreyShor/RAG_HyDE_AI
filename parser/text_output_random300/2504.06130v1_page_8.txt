[43]. Similar TPA and TP-PL for excitation (close) to the 1s resonance was reported for
a MoSe2 sample embedded in a cavity [44]. Our results confirm the possibility to directly
excite the 1s state of excitons in TMDs via TPA, an approach that could be used to realize
a high degree of valley polarization [6].

FIG. 3. Crystal symmetry-resolved nonlinear optics in monolayer WSe2 a, 2D color maps
for different combinations of excitation (input) and detection (output) polarization. Parametric
wavelength-dependent NLO processes, like SHG and THG, show distinct polarization dependen-
cies, whereas the non-parametric TP-PL (centered at an emission wavelength of ∼750 nm) shows
an unpolarized emission in all cases. b, Overview of observed connections of input and output
polarizations for different NLO processes. c, Normalized intensity of the acquired spectra for the
AC-AC (pink) and the AC-ZZ case (green) for a FB at 1.5 µm (white dashed line cut through color
maps in a). The much broader FWHM for detection along ZZ indicates a complete suppression of
the SH contribution.

All-Optical Bandgap Modulation
Having established the method to filter the SH signal from the TP-PL background, we
now focus on the SH power-dependent measurements in the spectral region of the A:1s res-
onance. We analyze the power-dependent SHG data sets and their scaling (see Fig. 4a) for
FB wavelengths ranging from 1.43 µm to 1.58 µm. In Fig. 4a, we show a set of exemplary
wavelengths, where we compare the scaling factor ξ, the proportionality between the gener-
