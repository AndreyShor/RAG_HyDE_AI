With the rapid growth of quantum-related research, the number of review papers in this field has 
expanded significantly. These reviews play a crucial role in summarizing recent advancements, identifying 
key challenges, and outlining future research directions. Several comprehensive reviews have been 
published, covering various aspects of quantum defect physics, material platforms, and semiconductor 
qubits. Some of the most notable reviews include: 
i) 
Zhang et al. [22], "Material Platforms for Defect Qubits and Single-Photon Emitters". This 
review provides a broad overview of solid-state systems pivotal for spin-based quantum 
technologies. It discusses advancements in solid-state spins and single-photon emitters across 
multiple host materials, including diamond, silicon carbide (SiC), hexagonal boron nitride 
(hBN), silicon, and two-dimensional semiconductors. The authors also emphasize the role of 
theoretical and computational methods in guiding experimental progress in defect-based 
quantum technologies. 
ii) 
Chatterjee et al. [23], "Semiconductor Qubits in Practice". This paper provides a detailed 
analysis of semiconductor-based qubits, covering their implementation in quantum 
computing, quantum simulation, quantum sensing, and quantum networking. The review 
highlights the key challenges and progress in integrating these systems into scalable quantum 
architectures.
