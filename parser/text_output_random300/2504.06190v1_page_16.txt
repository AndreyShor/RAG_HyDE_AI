No-scale supergravity
fluxes only is obtained with W = k(T2U2 + T3U3). In the Type-IIA case,
where O6-planes and D6-branes (O6/D6) are also present, the bulk fluxes
compatible with the orbifold and orientifold projections are: 12 ω3, 4 H3 and
(1+3+3+1) fluxes for the RR field strengths (F0, F2, F4, F6). In this case,
the discussion of the BI needs to take into account the contributions from
localized sources, and is no longer equivalent to the Jacobi identities of a
N = 4 gauging [63]. The rich system of fluxes can induce in W dependences
on all 7 main moduli, but at most linear in the UA. Several options for
no-scale models arise, for example: W = a(T1U1 + T2U2), purely from ω3;
W = a(ST1 + T2T3) + ib(S + T1T2T3), from (ω3, F2, H3, F6); W = a(ST1 +
ST2+ST3+T1T2+T2T3+T3T1)+3ib(S+T1T2T3), from (ω3, F0, H3, F2). In the
Type-IIB case, one can choose either (O3/D3+O7/D7) or (O5/D5+O9/D9)
systems and proceed accordingly. For example, with (O3/D3+O7/D7) we
can consider H3 and F3 fluxes, constrained by suitable BI involving localized
sources, and generate W(S, U1, U2, U3) with no dependence on (T1, T2, T3):
again, there are acceptable choices leading to no-scale models.
All of the above can be generalized to include the scalars coming from the
untwisted sectors, and in some cases also the twisted sectors.
1.3.2 Full-fledged compactifications
The behaviour of a reduced d = 4 supergravity theory does not capture the
physics of the full compactified theory. In the case of no-scale supergrav-
ity, such theory contains also infinite towers of Kaluza–Klein (KK) modes,
with supersymmetry-breaking mass splittings that depend on the classically
massless moduli, associated with geometrical properties of the compactifica-
tion manifold. In addition, compactified string theories also contain winding
modes, corresponding to strings wrapped around the compactification man-
ifold, whose effects exponentially decouple in the MC ≪MS limit. String
models with localized defects such as orbifold fixed points, D-branes, O-
planes, etc give rise to additional non-perturbative states in the spectrum
and make the effective supergravity more complicated to analyse and not
always under full control.
In the rest of this section, we consider d > 4 no-scale supergravities where
supersymmetry is broken in a Scherk-Schwarz compactification, to under-
stand some important qualitative differences with respect to their reduced
d = 4 versions, especially for what concerns the quantum corrections along
the flat directions of the classical potential. We expect our considerations to
be valid also for their string theory completions, when they exist, as long as
they do not involve localized defects and the limit MC ≪MS can be taken.
