We now give a brief account of Nelson’s stochastic mechanics and the Nelson/Newton
Law, Nelson’s version of Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion hidden in the Schr¨odinger equation
for our Hamiltonian. This is no substitute for Nelson’s and Fenyes’ original work. (See
Refs. [13], [14] and[15]).
For the above set-up the quantum Hamiltonian, H = 2−1p2 + V (q), reads
H = −ℏ2
2 △x +V (x)
for a unit mass particle P, subject to the force field −∇V (x), x ∈Rd, and the
Schr¨odinger equation can be written as
iℏψ∗∂ψ
∂t = −ℏ2
2 ψ∗△ψ + V |ψ|2,
(SE)
for quantum state ψ. We study the real and imaginary parts of this identity.
Equating imaginary parts of this equation gives for ρ = |ψ|2, the quantum particle
density,
∂ρ
∂t + divj = 0,
j being the probability current,
j = ℏ
2i(ψ∗∇ψ −ψ∇ψ∗).
Writing ψ = exp(Rϵ+iSϵ), ρ = exp(2Rϵ), and, if (Rϵ+iSϵ) = R + iS
ϵ2
, ϵ2 = ℏ, we obtain
the continuity equation,
∂ρ
∂t = ∇.

where b = ∇(R + S).
Nelson regards this equation as the forward Kolmogorov equation for the diffusion
process X, for ϵ2 = ℏ,
dX(t) = b(X(t), t)dt + ϵdB(t),
t > 0,
B(.) a BM(Rd) process with E(Bi(s)Bj(t)) = δijmin(s, t), for s, t > 0,
