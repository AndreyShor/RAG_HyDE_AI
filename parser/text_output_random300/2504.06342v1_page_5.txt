Godunov method with directionally unsplit and
staggered-mesh (USM) schemes ensures robust so-
lution of hydrodynamic equations. The code’s effi-
cient CPU parallelization and its GPU-compatible
version, AthenaK (Stone et al. 2024), provide op-
portunities for future computational enhancements.
The simulation solves three-dimensional hydro-
dynamic equations in spherical coordinates (𝑟, 𝜃,
𝜙) using the standard Euler form, incorporating
specialized gas physics and feedback mechanisms
detailed in subsequent sections. The computational
domain spans from 𝑟in = 25 pc to 𝑟out = 250 kpc,
enabling simultaneous resolution of gas accretion
flows across the SMBH Bondi radius (Bondi &
Hoyle 1944) and large-scale galactic and halo en-
vironmental effects.
The fiducial resolution is
256×64×128, where radial grid spacing decreases
logarithmically from outer to inner boundaries,
achieving sub-pc resolution at the inner boundary.
While this sub-pc resolution substantially increases
computational demands for Gyr timescale evolu-
tion, it remains essential for accurate capture of
accretion flows and AGN feedback processes. Un-
der this configuration, the number of total timestep
cycles for the simulation is a few 107 to reach the
total duration of 1.3 Gyr for the fiducial simulation
(and 1 Gyr for other simulations with varying feed-
back prescriptions).
To maintain computational
efficiency, the simulation excludes a 6◦region near
the z-axis to avoid geometric singularities.
2.2. Initial and boundary conditions
The initial conditions of our simulations consist
of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass
𝑀bh at the center of a dark matter halo (DM)
which is modeled as a spherically symmetric quasi-
isothermal halo with a circular velocity 𝑣c, and em-
bedded within a stellar distribution and gas dis-
tribution in hydrostatic equilibrium.
The stellar
component follows the Jaffe profile (Jaffe 1983):
𝜌∗=
𝑀∗𝑟∗
4𝜋𝑟2(𝑟∗+ 𝑟)2,
(1)
where 𝑀∗represents the total stellar mass and 𝑟∗
denotes the galaxy scale length. The distribution of
gas number density 𝑛g is characterized by the beta
model (Mo et al. 2010):
𝑛g = 𝑛0

1 + 𝑟2
𝑟2𝑐
−3𝛽
2
,
(2)
where 𝑛0 is the central gas number density and 𝑟𝑐
is the core radius and the beta parameter 𝛽= 2/3.
The gas is initialized without rotation and config-
ured to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium within a
dark matter halo. The total mass profile is designed
to follow an 𝑟−2 law, consistent with observational
constraints (Czoske et al. 2008; Dye et al. 2008).
The gas metallicity is initially set to 2𝑍⊙within
0.125𝑟𝑐and decreases following a power-law pro-
file with radius, reaching sub-solar values beyond
𝑟𝑐. We also note that dark matter halo and stellar
component are static in our simulations, therefore
the dynamical response of the gravitational poten-
tial to gas inflows, outflows, and feedback processes
is not captured.
We suspect that in the case of
an elliptical galaxy, where the stellar component
is typically dispersion-supported and evolves more
slowly compared to disk galaxies, the impact of
this approximation may be less severe. However,
we acknowledge that this is a limitation of our cur-
rent model and will be addressed in future work.
For boundary conditions, the outer boundary em-
ploys a modified outflow boundary condition: the
standard outflow boundary condition allows the gas
to enter or leave the computational domain across
the outer boundary with zero gradient for density
and velocity, while a non-zero pressure gradient
with 𝜕𝑟𝑃= 𝜌𝑔is always enforced at the outer
boundary in order to preserve the hydrostatic equi-
librium of the gas, where 𝑔is the local gravitational
acceleration measured at the outer boundary. At the
inner boundary, we employ conditions that permit
gas to leave the computational domain which is
treated as black hole accretion, and simultaneously
inject mass and momentum into the computational
domain at certain rates and opening angles to sim-
