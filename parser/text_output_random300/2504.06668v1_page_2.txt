Introduction
The global decline in fertility rates is a demographic shift with profound im-
plications for social systems and economies worldwide. This decline, driven
by factors such as rising levels of female education, economic development,
urbanization, and improved living standards, presents challenges in countries
like Japan and South Korea, where fertility rates have fallen well below replace-
ment levels. While the characterization of these declines as catastrophic varies
depending on the context, their impact on aging populations and labor force
contraction is widely acknowledged.
In many societies, shifts in values and attitudes toward family size, delays
in marriage, and increased gender equality have contributed to these changes.
Moreover, advances in healthcare and reductions in child mortality have further
altered fertility patterns. These factors interact in complex ways, and their
relative importance varies across regions, underscoring the need for a nuanced
understanding of fertility dynamics to inform policy interventions.
Historically, mathematical models of fertility have focused on estimating
fertility rates (Brass, 1975), forecasting trends (Lutz et al., 1999; Lee and
Carter, 1992), analyzing the quantum and tempo of fertility (Bongaarts and
Feeney, 1998), and modeling age-specific fertility patterns (Asili et al., 2014;
Gaire et al., 2022). This study proposes a novel fertility model based on Thomâ€™s
nonlinear differential equations of morphogenesis. The model integrates tra-
ditional fertility factors with catastrophic socioeconomic and environmental
shocks that influence pregnancy rates and, on a larger scale, fertility outcomes.
In the fertility catastrophe model, the system states are influenced by control
parameters that can induce abrupt changes in fertility outcomes. These param-
eters govern the transition from stable fertility trends to sudden, discontinuous
shifts in fertility patterns.
Of particular interest in the model are the bifurcation parameters, which
determine the discontinuities in the fertility response surface. When these
parameters exceed certain thresholds, they may trigger catastrophic events,
resulting in marked decreases or increases in pregnancy rates. The estimation
and testing of these parameters provide critical insights into the occurrence
and impact of catastrophic fertility events. Importantly, the model accounts
for both negative and positive fertility shocks, allowing for the examination
of population declines as well as potential booms. A thorough understanding
of these events can assist policymakers in preparing for demographic shifts,
facilitating more robust public health planning and policy responses.
