(a)                                                              (b) 
Fig. 1 In (a) the light element production rate is shown as a function of the two MvdW EoS 
parameters a and b are varied and in (b) we show the heavy element production rate as the 
MvdW parameters are again varied: 0.5 < a < 2.5, and 0.02 < b < 0.1 . The heavy element 
production rate is more sensitive to both a and b favoring the smaller values for higher 
production.  
We next consider an r process and s process production sequence shown in Fig 2. Here we have 
the r process rates for: 56Fe, 56Co, 56Ni, 56Zn and s process rates for: 56Fe, 57Fe, 58Fe, 88Sr, 89Sr, 
90Sr, 138Ba, 139Ba for a kilonova event as a function of time, with and without massive neutrinos. 
The massive neutrino effects can be seen from the massive neutrino cross section suppression 
effect.  Essentially adding the mass term to the full neutrino 4-momentum reduces the available 
reaction energy and changes the cross section as can be seen from the ratio of cross sections in 
Eq.(10). These cross sections are used to determine the rate factors λ causing a change in the 
overall production rate.

In our model the ejecta mass is set to 0.1 Mʘ and both neutrino cases are compared where we 
have used solid curves for the massless case and dashed curves for the massive case and a value 
of 0.8 eV for the electron neutrino mass.
