FIG. 6. Similar to Figure 2 in the main text, with shaded areas indicating the width of the error bars. Panel
(a) shows the mean time to absorption TA and Panel (b), the mean time to failure TF . In 68% (one standard deviation above
or below the mean) of the simulations, the results fall within the shaded area. The results present over 104 different networks
for each N.
