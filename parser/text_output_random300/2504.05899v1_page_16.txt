and ns >> nqp, Eq. (12) can be rewritten as
∆fr(T)
fr(T0) ≃−Lk,l(T) −Lk,l(T0)
2Lk,l(T0)
= ns(T) −ns(T0)
2ns(T)
= −∆nqp(T)
2ns(T) ,
(13)
where changes in quasiparticle density is defined to be −∆nqp(T) = ns(T)−ns(T0) assuming
nqp + ns = const. We also used the relation, λ2 = m/(µ0nse2) [6], for the above derivation.
In contrast, at temperatures below 1000 mK, a small kink is observed for each mode,
which is typically attributed to changes in permittivity induced by two-level systems (TLS)
surrounding the resonator [1, 2, 10]. According to the cavity perturbation theory [11], a small
perturbation in the electromagnetic field around the resonator due to changes in permittivity
shifts the resonance frequency as

(14)
where fr is the unperturbed resonance frequency, f ′
r is the perturbed resonance frequency,
Wlocal is the region in which the permittivity changes, W0 is the entire region containing
the resonator’s electromagnetic field, E0 and H0 are the unperturbed electric and magnetic
fields, respectively, ∆ϵ represents the change in permittivity, ϵ is the permittivity, and µ is
the permeability. Here,

is the participation ratio or the filling factor corresponding to the fraction of the volume in
which the permittivity changes occur. We assume that the spatial variation in ∆ϵ is negli-
gible within Wlocal. This assumption is reasonable for both the global, temperature-driven
changes in ϵ and the local, laser-induced changes in ϵ, given the homogeneous substrate and
TLS distribution.
