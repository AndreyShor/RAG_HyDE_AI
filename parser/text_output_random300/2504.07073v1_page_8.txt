Fig. 5. Same as Fig. 4, but now for He-star models with initial mass Mini = 5 M⊙(solid line), 15 M⊙(dashed line), and 30 M⊙(dash-dotted line).
The different symbols on the track mark the helium zero-age main sequence (stars), and core-helium depletion (diamond). For the lowest panels,
the mass-loss recipe of Sander & Vink (2020), which has a direct ˙M ∝Γe scaling relation is shown as a solid line.
H-rich WR stars should have mass-loss rates higher than those
predicted by the pure He-star models.
To model the He- and WR-star phases in stellar evolution cal-
culations, often the mass-loss prescription from Nugis & Lamers
(2000) is applied. The upper panels in Fig. 5 illustrate how ˙M
changes as a function of Γe during the evolution of a He-star
model using this recipe. By comparison to the empiric ˙M −Γe
plane, it is evident that the mass-loss rates of Nugis & Lamers
(2000) are significantly overestimated, being about a factor of
three higher than observed for Galactic stars. This mismatch is
surprising, given that the rates from Nugis & Lamers (2000)
were calibrated using Galactic stars and are based on radio data
with clumping correction. They are also roughly in line with the
results from Hamann et al. (2006); Sander et al. (2019). Assum-
ing this difference is not due to any diagnostic issues, the appar-
ent offset could be due to the difference between the WR sam-
ple selected for this work and the underlying sample of Nugis
& Lamers (2000). Except for WR137, all of the Galactic WR
stars selected for this work have rather small mass-loss rates and
three out of the five stars are high-mass WNh-type stars. The dis-
crepancy between our evolution models using Nugis & Lamers
(2000) and the curated observational sample becomes even more
pronounced at lower metallicities due to the relatively shallow
metallicity dependence in the Nugis & Lamers (2000) prescrip-
tion, ˙M ∝Z0.5.
However, one has to be careful when comparing their mass-
loss rates across metallicity to our results, as their metallicity
includes all metals, while our metallicity only refers to the iron
