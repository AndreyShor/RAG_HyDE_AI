approximation was presented in Ref. [486, 487]. NLOQCD corrections are also available with
a reweighting procedure for the massive two-loop gg →V V amplitudes [488, 489]. NLOQCD
corrections matched to parton showers in the POWHEG approach were presented in Ref. [490].
The two-loop amplitudes for gg →V V processes with massive quark loops were computed
in Refs. [491–493].
Recently, the amplitudes of Ref. [491] were used to compute the exact
NLOQCD corrections to gg →V V , including the signal and background processes and their
interference [494]. It is found that the reweighting approach provides an extremely accurate
approximation to the full two-loop amplitudes.
The interference between the Higgs-mediated gg →H →γγ process and the prompt
background gg →γγ process results in a shift in the Higgs peak in the diphoton invariant mass
distribution, which can be used to constrain the Higgs width [495]. Although it is expected that
such bounds are about 5-30 times the Standard Model Higgs width value, and therefore less
constraining than measurements in using offshell Higgs production, they do not suffer from the
same model dependence, and in that sense are complementary. The LO analysis of Ref. [495]
was refined to include all partonic channels [496] and the emission of one [497] and two [498]
hard jets. NLOQCD corrections, first presented in Ref. [499] and later confirmed in Ref. [500],
reduce the shift of the mass peak by around 40%. Small pT resummation was performed in
Ref. [501]. The higher order corrections Recently, the NNLOQCD corrections in the soft-virtual
limit (i.e. neglecting hard emissions) were presented [502], using three-loop helicity amplitudes
for gg →γγ [503] and two-loop amplitudes for γγj production [504, 505]. These corrections
reduce the mass shift by a further 30%.
Interference effects between the Higgs-mediated process gg →H →Zγ and the prompt
background gg →Zγ have been computed in Ref. [506] to NLOQCD, employing the soft-virtual
approximation. It was found that the interference effects amount to around −3% of the signal
gg →H →Zγ cross section, and that the NLOQCD corrections are small, below the current
experimental accuracy.
The experimental uncertainty on the total Higgs boson cross section is currently of the
order of 8% [507] based on a data sample of 139 fb−1, and is expected to reduce to the order of
3% or less with a data sample of 3000 fb−1 [508]. Most Higgs boson couplings will be known to 2-
5% [509]. To achieve the desired theoretical uncertainty, it may be necessary to also consider the
finite-mass effects at NNLOQCD from b and c quarks, combined with fully differential N3LOHTL
corrections.
Sometimes the form of experimental cuts can affect the perturbative stability of the theo-
retical prediction through linear fiducial power corrections. This is the case, for example, for the
traditional cuts applied to the decay photons in Higgs boson diphoton events. The traditional
cuts require that each of the two photons have a transverse momentum greater than a given
fraction of the Higgs boson mass (typically 0.35 for the leading and 0.25 for the sub-leading
photon). This leads to an instability of the perturbative convergence of the prediction and in-
creased scale uncertainties, most noticeable at N3LO. This issue can be avoided by a re-design
of the cuts [244] and is currently being investigated by the LHC experiments. A brief summary
of the issues associated with fiducial cuts was given in the 2021 document [1].
