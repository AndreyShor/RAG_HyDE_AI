Key Points: 
● The Ocean Heat Uptake Efficiency (OHUE) has notably increased over recent decades, 
as evidenced by observations and model simulations. 
● This increase of OHUE is closely associated with the eruption of Mount Pinatubo (1991).  
● Following the eruption, a gradual ocean recovery leads to a peak in OHUE around year 
2000.
