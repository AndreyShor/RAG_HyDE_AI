: Hysteresis around the superconducting pocket at finite D
For (ν, D) = 2.6, −0.30 V/nm when the SC phase is relatively weaker but not suppressed enough, signatures
of Rxx hysteresis are absent (SI-Fig. 15b). As soon as we move to the +ve D side, which has a more
stronger suppression effect on the SC, at (ν, D) = 2.6, 0.60 V/nm 11, we recover the familiar shape of BMR
hysteresis response with a finite value of reduced magnetoresistance (rMR), |∆Rxx| (SI-Fig. 15e). It is
striking to note that for any given |D|, the boundaries of the SC phase on the filling axis, i.e., ν ∼2.2 and
ν ∼3, we always have a Rxx hysteresis with B|| sweep and a finite rMR, |∆Rxx|. This observation can
be seen more easily from the ∆Rxx(ν, B||) 2−d colormap in SI-Fig. 16a,b,c for three different values of
D = −0.30 V/nm, 0.00 V/nm, and 0.60 V/nm. For D = −0.30 V/nm and 0.00 V/nm we see two separate
hysteresis ‘islands’ around ν ∼2 and ν ∼3 (SI-Fig. 16a,b) with similar sign (+/−) and magnitude of
∆Rxx with ∓B||. These two islands are observed to have merged in SI-Fig. 16c by a weak inter-connecting
hysteresis region at D = 0.60 V/nm. We also see that between ν ∼0.5 −1.3 for D = 0.00 V/nm and 0.60
V/nm, there is a reversal of the sign of the MR with |B|||, highlighted by a dashed box in SI-Fig. 16b,c, the
implications of which will be discussed in later sections.

: Effect of temperature of the MC plate with B|| sweep at finite D
Similar to SI- 3, We have tried to see if a change of TMC with a continuous B|| sweep has any effect on the
observed nature of BMR response and ∆Rxx magnitude at finite D magnitudes. Similarly RFW

MC and T BW
MC are plotted in SI-Fig. 17 for different values of (ν, D). As shown in the bottom panels of
SI-Fig. 17a-f, the TMC profile for the ‘forward’ and ‘backward’ sweep are always similar for any choice of
(ν, D) irrespective of the nature of BMR (hysteresis or no hysteresis). Here also, the profile of the increase
in temperature is monotonic which does not correlate to the non-monotonic increase or decrease of Rxx vs.
B|| curves.
