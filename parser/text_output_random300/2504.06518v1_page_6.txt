Non Nucleonic Components in Short Nuclear Distances

where “i", “m" and “f" subscripts correspond to initial, intermediate and final 𝑁𝑁states, respec-
tively, and momenta 𝑘𝑖,𝑚, 𝑓are defined similar to Eq.(4).
The realization of the angular condition for the relativistic case requires:
𝑉(𝑘𝑖,𝑧, 𝑘𝑖⊥, 𝑘𝑚,𝑧, 𝑘𝑚,⊥) = 𝑉(®𝑘2
𝑖, (®𝑘𝑚−®𝑘𝑖)2),
(15)
resulting in:
𝑇𝑜𝑛𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑙𝑙
𝑁𝑁
(𝑘𝑖,𝑧, 𝑘𝑖⊥, 𝑘𝑚,𝑧, 𝑘𝑚,⊥) = 𝑇𝑜𝑛𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑙𝑙
𝑁𝑁
(®𝑘2
𝑖, (®𝑘𝑚−®𝑘𝑖)2)

and the existence of the Born term in Eq.(14) indicates that the potential 𝑉satisfies the same
condition in the on-shell limit.
For the off-shell potential[16] that requirements for the potential 𝑉to satisfy angular condition
in the on-shell limit and that it can be constructed through the series of elastic 𝑝𝑛scatterings
result to the 𝑉and 𝑇𝑁𝑁functions satisfying the similar angular conditions (Eqs.(15,16)). Using
such a potential to calculate the LF deuteron wave function will result in a momentum distribution
dependent only on the magnitude of the relative 𝑝𝑛momentum.
Inclusion of the inelastic transitions will completely change the LF equation for the 𝑝𝑛scatter-
ing. For example, the contribution of 𝑁∗𝑁transition to the elastic 𝑁𝑁scattering:
𝑇𝑁𝑁(𝑘𝑖,𝑧, 𝑘𝑖⊥, 𝑘𝑓,𝑧, 𝑘𝑓,⊥) =
∫
𝑉𝑁𝑁∗(𝑘𝑖,𝑧, 𝑘𝑖⊥, 𝑘𝑚,𝑧, 𝑘𝑚,⊥)

will not require the condition of Eq.(15) with the transition potential having also an imaginary
component. Eq.(17) can not be described with any combination of elastic 𝑁𝑁interaction potentials
that satisfies the angular condition. The same will be true also for ΔΔ →𝑁𝑁and 𝑁𝑐, 𝑁𝑐→𝑁𝑁
transitions. Thus one concludes that if the Γ5 term is not zero and results in a 𝑘⊥dependence of LF
momentum distribution then it should originate from a non-nucleonic component in the deuteron.

Predictions and estimate of the possible effects
Our calculations predict three new effects, that in probing deuteron structure at very large
internal momenta (≥𝑚𝑁) in reaction (1): (i) the LF momentum distribution should be enhanced
compared to 𝑆- and 𝐷- wave contributions only; (ii) there should be angular anisotropy in the LF
momentum distribution; (iii) the tensor asymmetry should be significantly different as expected
from 𝑆- and 𝐷- wave contributions only.
Observation of all the above effects will indicate a presence of non-nucleonic components in
the deuteron wave function at large internal momenta.
To give quantitative estimates of the possible effects we evaluate the Γ5 vertex function assuming
two color-octet baryon transition to the 𝑝𝑛system (𝑁𝑐𝑁𝑐→𝑝𝑛) through the one-gluon exchange,
parameterizing it in the dipole form
𝐴
(1+ 𝑘2
0.71 )2 .
The parameter 𝐴is estimated by assuming 1%
contribution to the total normalization from the 𝑃wave. In Fig.2 (right panel) we consider the
dependence of the momentum distribution of Eq.(12) as a function of cos 𝜃= (𝛼−1)𝐸𝑘
𝑘
for different
values of 𝑘. Notice that if the momentum distribution is generated by the 𝑝𝑛component only, the
angular condition is satisfied, and no dependence should be observed.
