Definition 2. Let G be a ribbon graph with oriented and non-oriented edges. We assume that G has
two types of vertices: a (fundamental) vertex with two oriented edges and one non-oriented edge and
an (adjoint) vertex with three non-oriented edges. We write eG, vG, hG, cG for the number of edges,
the number of vertices, the number of independent cycles (loops), and the number of components of G,
respectively. The empty (self-)loop ◦(top graphs in Figure 5) has e◦= v◦= 0 and h◦= c◦= 1.
The graph G can have external (non-paired) half-edges (hairs).
Equivalently, we connect external
vertices to the external half-edges and obtain a decomposition of the vertices into external (one-valent)
and internal (three-valent) vertices, vG = vext
G + vint
G .
After the removal of the non-oriented edges, G decomposes into a collection of fG oriented cycles.
The reduction of the color graph G is RG(N).
From graph homology we get

hG −eG + vG −cG = 0
and from counting half-edges we obtain

2.2. Fundamental identities. The core identity for color reductions is depicted in Figure 4.
This
identity is specific to the Lie algebras sl(N). Similar reduction formulae for other Lie algebras are in [3].
Proposition 3. In any orthonormal basis T i, we obtain for the sum P

of the basis elements,
