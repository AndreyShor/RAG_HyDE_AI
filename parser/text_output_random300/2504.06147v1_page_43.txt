deφ2 . As a consistency check, it is useful to note that the heφeφ, heφ so
obtained equal the old hφφ, hφ with replacements φ 7→φc + eφ.
When we convert between A-
model and B-model free energy expansions about φc, we take F (g) = (ϖ(c)
0 )2g−2F(g). Since two of
our conifold points are valued in Q(1/√−27) it is convenient computationally to use the methods
developed in [36] for implementing the gap condition at conifold points that are roots of a polynomial
irreducible over Q, so that we can treat both roots of 1 + 27φ2 simultaneously and do not need to
perform two separate expansions.
Expanding about the apparent singularity
Our model has an apparent singularity at φ = 5/9, where Y
φ is smooth. However, the prop-
agators Sφφ, Sφ S that we have constructed have singularities at φ = 5/9.
So too then does
P (g)(Sφφ, Sφ, S), but F(g) must be regular.
So, we must include terms in f(g)(φ) such that
P (g) + f(g) is regular at φ = 5/9. We use a mirror coordinate
tApp = ϖ(App)

Let us explain the above expansions. Note that, as displayed in the Riemann symbol Table 1, the
indices of the Picard-Fuchs operator at φ = 5/9 are (0, 1, 3, 4). This means that there exists a
basis of series solutions, starting 1 + ..., eφ + ..., eφ3 + ..., eφ4 + ... . The solution ϖ0 is characterised
by being the unique solution with leading term 1 and no terms of degree 1,3, or 4. We then seek
a solution ϖ(App)
1
such that when we recompute the propagators as expansions in eφ the ensuing
propagator ambiguities heφeφ, heφ read off from (A.4) equal our previous expressions hφφ, hφ after a
tensor transformation (merely substituting φ = 5/9 + eφ, as the Jacobian is 1). This recomputation
involves taking the holomorphic limit with Keφ 7→−∂eφ log(ϖ(App)

deφ2 . Our
tensorial requirement on the propagator ambiguities is satisfied by the choice of ϖ(App)

in (A.19).
Having recomputed the propagators as expansions about eφ = 0, we choose b(App)

in (A.12) so that
F(g)(eφ) is regular (i.e. has a Taylor expansion with no negative powers of eφ. Equivalently,
F (g≥2)
Apparent(tApp) = O(1),
(A.20)
which is similar to the gap condition (A.16) with |Gc| = 0.
Expanding about infinity
In the main body of this paper, we consider the MUM point ϕ ≡
1
729φ = 0 and attempt to extract
an associated geometry from the genus 2,3,4, topological string free energies. Here we shall outline
how to obtain those expansions. Our Yukawa coupling, in the ϕ-coordinate, is
