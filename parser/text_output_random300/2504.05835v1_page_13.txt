Assuming Hinf = 1012GeV, we have H2

This is still insuﬃcient to confront with observations unless we assign a ridiculously small
T. We conclude that there must be an ampliﬁcation for the scalar ﬁeld to generate suﬃcient
PMFs.
4.2
Setup and eﬀective potential
As discussed before, we need to enhance the scalar ﬁeld to generate suﬃcient PMFs. Let’s
introduce an auxiliary ﬁeld χ which couples to the scalar φ, and the potential for the scalar
ﬁeld φ including the thermal mass
V (φ) = λ2Mpχ|φ|2 + π2
12̺2T 2|φ|2 .
(4.18)
We comment that the potential of φ shall include higher order terms, e.g., λ2
4φ4 for it to be
bounded from below. Those term has to be suppressed by the factor φ/Mp at the magneto-
genesis epoch for the validation of the eﬀective potential (4.18). On the other hand, the
interaction term λ2Mpχ|φ|2 has negligible contribution to the dynamics of χ ﬁeld since λ is
extremely small as we shall see later. Thus the dynamics of χ is approximately determined
by Lχ.
We shall adopt some ansatzs for the auxiliary ﬁeld χ. We assume that the χ ﬁeld is
initially in a local vacuum with ⟨χ⟩= −m2/(λ2Mp) < 0. Thus, when the universes cools
down to a critical temperature
T1 = 2
√
3m
π̺
,
(4.19)
the eﬀective mass of φ ﬁeld becomes negative and φ will experience a tachyonic growth.
The growth stop when χ transitions to the positive expectation value ⟨χ⟩= M2/(λ2Mp).
