Definition 10 (d-separation). A path p in a DAG is said to be d-separated (or blocked) by a set of nodes D if at least
one of the following conditions holds:
(i) p contains a chain X →Y →Z or fork X ←Y →Z such that the middle node Y is in D, or
(ii) p contains an inverted fork (or collider) X →Y ←Z such that the middle node Y is not in D and such that
no descendant of Y is in D.
A set D is said to d-separate B from C if and only if D blocks every path from a node in B to a node in C.
Lemma 5 (Equivalent Markov conditions, [77, Theorem 3.27], see also [76, Lemma 1]). Let p(V1, . . . , Vn) be the joint
distribution of random variables V1, . . . , Vn (as always, in this work, with respect to a product measure). Then the
following three statements are equivalent:
(i) Recursive form: p(V1, . . . , Vn) admits the factorization
p(V1, . . . , Vn) =
n
Y
j=1
p(Vj| PAj),
(E1)
where the notation p(Vj| PAj) is understood as p(Vj) if PAj is empty.
(ii) Local (or parental) Markov condition: for every node Vj we have
I[Vj; NDj | PAj] = 0,
(E2)
i.e., it is conditionally independent of its non-descendants (except itself), given its parents.
(iii) Global Markov condition:
I[B; C|D] = 0
(E3)
for all three sets B, C, D of nodes for which B and C are d-separated by D.
In the following, we will make extensive use of the notion of compatibility of a distribution with a Bayesian network,
which we define as follows.
Definition 11. Let p be a distribution over a set of variables W, and let G be a Bayesian network with nodes V such
that W ⊆V . Then, the distribution p is said to be compatible with G if
I[B; C|D] = 0
(E4)
for all three sets B, C, D ⊆W of nodes for which B and C are d-separated by D.
Note that the conditions given by eq. (E4) are those global Markov conditions with respect to G which only involve
variables of p. Compatibility of p with G thus means that the Markov conditions implied by G for the variables of p
hold.

d-separation conditions for percept-action loops
One may initially be tempted to think that the Bayesian network depicted in Figure 9b is compatible with any
Φ = (ϕ(j|i))j,i with i ∈W ×M and j ∈Y ×Z (see Figure 9a) in the sense that all local Markov conditions implied by
Figure 9b hold for any distribution pW XY Z(w, x, y, z) = ϕ(y, z|w, x)pW X(w, x). Figure 9b implies (by d-separation)
conditional independence of Y and Z given their parents, that is,
I[Y ; Z|W, X] = 0.
(E5)
This condition, however, is easily shown to be violated by a channel which produces correlation independent of the
values of W and X. For instance, let ϕ(0, 0|w, x) = ϕ(1, 1|w, x) = 1/2 for all w ∈W and x ∈M and where 0, 1 ∈Y,
0, 1 ∈Z. Then, eq. (E5) is clearly not fulfilled.
The problem related to Figure 9b can be solved with a little sleight of hand: We introduce an additional variable
V = Y Z, defined as the joint channel output, as depicted in Figure 9c [78]. This is by no means the only way to
