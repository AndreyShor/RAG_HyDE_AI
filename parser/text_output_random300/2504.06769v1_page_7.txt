Consequently, the birth rates of the neighboring mutant and
resident denote as br
m(j) = eωΠr
m(j)/(k+1) and br
r(j) =
eωΠr
r(j)/(k+1), respectively. The birth rate is proportional to
the probability of taking over an empty site for which a given
mutant or resident individual competes.
For death-birth updating [24, 48, 49], the frequency of mu-
tants and mutant-mutant pairs increases whenever a resident
dies and a mutant neighbor repopulates the vacated site. For a
resident with j mutant neighbors, this happens with probabil-
ity

Updating a mutant
We here consider that a mutant is selected and replaced by a
neighboring resident. We also assume that there are j mutants
among the k nearest neighbors. By considering the possible
configurations around the mutant, we can estimate his/her res-
ident and mutant neighbors’ payoff values. Accordingly, the
total payoff of the resident player, who is the neighbor of the
selected mutant individual, can be given as

Similarly, the frequency of mutants and mutant-mutant
pairs decreases if a mutant dies and one of his/her resident
neighbors reproduces. For a mutant with j mutant neighbors,
this happens with probability

Appendix B: Adaptive dynamics of continuous PGG
Based on the above-mentioned description, T + and T −re-
spectively represent the probability that pm will increase or
decrease by 1/N. We assume that each invasion step takes
place in one unit of time 1/N [56, 58]. Hence the derivative
of pm is given by
˙pm =
k
X
j=0
(T +(j) −T −(j)).
(B1)
To derive the change rate in qm|m, it helps to start with
the changes in pmm. First, consider a resident with j mu-
tant neighbors who are successfully replaced by a mutant.
This happens with probability T +(j) and increases the num-
ber of mm-pairs by j or, equivalently, their frequency pmm
by 2j/(Nk), where Nk/2 is the total number of undirected
links in a regular graph of size N and degree k. Similarly,
with probability T −(j) a mutant with j mutant neighbors will
be replaced by a resident, reducing the frequency pmm by
2j/(Nk). So the change rate of pmm is
˙pmm =
k
X
i=0
(T +(j) −T −(j))2j
k .
(B2)
Finally, using ˙qm|m = ( ˙pmm −qm|m ˙pm)/pm results in
˙qm|m = 1

k

j=0
(T +(j) −T −(j))

In the limit pm →0, the sum over T +(j) in Eq. (A9) and
divided by pm is reduced to

T +(j)=
