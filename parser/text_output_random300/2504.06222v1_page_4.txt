energy, the faster the crack density increases. However, the two crystals also exhibit distinct trends 
in crack density along with their distinct crack patterns. The beam density influences more 
significantly on the crack density of FAPbBr3, whereas the beam energy affects more significantly 
on the crack density of MAPbBr3. The beam density indicates how focused the e-beam scanning 
area is, while the beam energy affects the electron's incident depth. The differing crack patterns in 
the two crystals are each more sensitive to one of the two factors, suggesting that the cracking 
processes in these two crystals are not identical. In addition, the crack density of MAPbBr3 
increases more than that of FAPbBr3 in Stage III because there is an apparent widening of cracks 
on the MAPbBr3 crystal surface.
