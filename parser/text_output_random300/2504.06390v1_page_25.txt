reinforcing that significant modulation of the total refractive index requires strong substrate,
carrier interaction, and an effective external driving mechanism. Panel (b) demonstrates
that the electric field acts as a secondary control parameter, enabling fine-tuning refractive
properties without drastically altering the dominant linear behavior, an asset for precision
control in integrated photonic applications.
Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the influence of the polaron effect on the linear and
nonlinear optical properties of a graphene monolayer placed on various polar substrates and
subjected to perpendicular magnetic and in-plane electric fields. We derived the absorption
coefficient and the relative refractive index under realistic field conditions by employing
the Lee–Low–Pines formalism to compute the ground-state energy and the density matrix
approach to derive the optical responses.
Our results demonstrate that surface optical phonons from the substrate enable optical
transitions at the zero Landau level of graphene. This interaction significantly enhances both
the linear and third-order nonlinear absorption coefficients and the associated refractive index
changes. Moreover, the combination of magnetic and electric fields intensifies the localization
and confinement of charge carriers, strengthening polaron formation and leading to sharper,
tunable optical responses—particularly in substrates with favorable dielectric and phonon
properties.
These findings highlight the potential of field-assisted polaron engineering as a versatile
tool to modulate the optical and transport properties of two-dimensional systems. As a next
step, we intend to explore the role of acoustic polarons and their impact on carrier mobility
and conductivity in graphene, extending the analysis beyond the optical regime and toward
realistic applications in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.
