To test whether Y0 and the ratios Yk/Y0 agree with the coefficients that can be read off from
(94), we used the method as sketched below.
We divided the coefficients with the leading asymptotics Γn+52−n in (95), and used Richard-
son extrapolation [30] as a series acceleration method to extract the constant asymptotics. That
is, if one has a series xn known up to a certain order, one can recursively compute x(s)

where with each step a correction term will drop out to the constant asymptotics in powers of
n−1:
xn = const. + O(n−1)
⇒
x(s)
n
= const. + O(n−s−1).
(104)
Then the last available term of the acceleration x(s)
n
is a good estimate of the constant. The
order s can be optimized, however for this analysis we used s = 30 in every case.
After measuring Y0 in this way, we can confirm that it indeed agrees with the exact value
Y0 = −4π−4 that can be deduced by comparing (94) and (102) - see Table 1. Knowing this
exact value of Y0 the leading term can be subtracted, and division by Y0Γn+42−n−4 revealed
the ratio Y1/Y0 after we used Richardson extrapolation again. This ratio again agrees with the
exact value Y1/Y0 = −25/4 up to high precision. These subtractions can then be repeated for
the subleading terms and this allows us to measure Yk/Y0 up to a certain order, that is limited
by the number of coefficients known in φ(0)
1,n and their precision. For the subtractions at each
step we were using the known exact values from (94) instead of the measured ones, to achieve
higher precision. Nevertheless, the fact that the measured and exact values match, up to several
digits, confirms our analytical result (75).
