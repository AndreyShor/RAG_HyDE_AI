Till now, the correspondence between the ALH and the model (2.24)
was rather general: any solution for (2.4) provide solution for (2.21)–(2.23).
However, not all of them can be used to obtain solutions with q and r being
relates by, say, rT = q†. One thus need some additional work. Moreover, we
have to make some slightly nonstandard steps. The case is that the ‘natural’
involution for the ALH-like equations is ρn = ±σ∗
n, τn = τ ∗
n where ∗stands for
the complex conjugation. Clearly, such involution does not provide necessary
relation between
2q and
2r. Nevertheless, this issue can be resolved. In the next
section we construct N-soliton solutions for our problem by modifying the
already known ones that have been derived earlier for the ALH and discuss
the issue of involution in more detail.

N-soliton solutions.
The main part of the structure of the soliton solutions are the so-called
‘soliton matrices’, that satisfy the system of Sylvester equations
LA −AR = |α⟩⟨a|,
RB −BL = |β⟩⟨b|
(3.1)
and that have been repeatedly used in the framework of the Cauchy matrix
approach (see, e.g., [13, 14, 15, 16]).
Here, L and R are constant diagonal complex matrices,
L = diag (L1, ..., LN) ,
R = diag (R1, ..., RN) ,
(3.2)
|α⟩and |β⟩are constant N-columns,
|α⟩= (α1, ..., αN)
T ,
|β⟩= (β1, ..., βN)
T ,
(3.3)
while N-rows ⟨a| and ⟨b|
⟨a| = (a1, ..., aN) ,
⟨b| = (b1, ..., bN)
(3.4)
depend on the coordinates and, in turn, determine the coordinate dependence
of the N × N matrices A and B.
Using the results of the paper [17], one can present functions (2.6) as
1q= ⟨a|R−1F|β⟩,
(3.5)
1r= ⟨b|L−1G|α⟩,
(3.6)
2q= 1 + ⟨a|R−1FB|α⟩,
