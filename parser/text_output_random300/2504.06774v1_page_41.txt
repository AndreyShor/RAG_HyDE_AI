show the best performance, with the narrowest error distribution. The LSTM 1 dense
architecture also demonstrates strong performance, but the streamwise velocity is not
centered at the zero error line.
In contrast, SVD-based models display broader error distributions across all LSTM
architectures, indicating higher variability and reduced reliability in the predictions. The
peaks are less pronounced compared to HOSVD, and the tails of the distributions extend
further, suggesting that SVD struggles to capture the intricate flow features. The stream-
