Node list: The initial node list contains all nodes. In (a), the market economy, 
to simulate enclosure, two selected nodes were added to the node list at each step, and 
two unselected nodes were deleted randomly. In (b), the power economy, two selected 
nodes were added at each step to simulate the mitigation of the enclosure. In the (c) gift 
and (d) concession economies, all nodes were listed equally, regardless of the step. 
 Edge direction: Since the exchange in (a) the market and (b) power 
economies, and the reciprocity with return in (c) the gift economy are performed, 
bidirectional edges (two directed edges) are generated between two nodes. In (d) the 
concession economy, since there is no obligation to return, a unidirectional edge (one-
directed edge) is generated between two nodes.
