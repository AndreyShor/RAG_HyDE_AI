butions to the opacities are calculated using the distorted-wave approximation154. Additional
details about the latest OPLIB release are provided in Colgan et al. (2016)34.
Data Availability Statement
OPLIB Data are available at: https://aphysics2.lanl.gov/apps/astro_atomic.py. The
codes used to generate the data are not publicly available due to constraints imposed by LANL. The SCO-
RCG data generated in this study are available upon request to J.-C. Pain (jean-christophe.pain@cea.fr).
The OPAS data itself is available upon e-mail request to philippe.cosse@cea.fr. The source data for the
ﬁgures in the main ﬁle as well as the supplementary are available with the paper.
The dataset used for the inversions is publicly available from the Birmingham Solar Oscillation Network
website2 and the Joint Science Operations Center portal 3.
The frequency sets can be found on 4. The datasets generated during and analysed during the current
study are available from the corresponding author upon request. Opacity proﬁles of the reference mod-
els are provided in Supplementary Data - 1 to 10, with the number corresponding to the Model number
in Table 1. Data for all ﬁgures are provided in the Source Data with this manuscript - Figure 1 to 4,
including the Supplementary Figures 1 to 12.
Code Availability Statement
The CLES stellar evolution code is a proprietary software, detailed structures are available on demand
by sending an email to the corresponding author. Further information on the code and availability can
made upon speciﬁc request by sending an email to the corresponding author and the main developer of
the code, R.Scuﬂaire@uliege.be. The inversion software used is publicly available at
https://lesia.obspm.fr/perso/daniel-reese/spaceinn/index.html. The codes
used to generate the OPAS data are not publicly available due to constraints imposed by CEA. OP tables,
code are publicly available and online computations can be carried out from their website
