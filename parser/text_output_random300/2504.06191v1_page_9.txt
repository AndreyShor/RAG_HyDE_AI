model shifts closer to the observational data. The MvdW EoS model is also compared to three 
other similar models and to an observational data set. The Leaky Box Model [76, 77], which 
accounts for gas outflows, where metals are ejected from the galaxy due to supernovae driven 
winds. The Infall Model [78, 79, 80] incorporates gas inflow, where pristine or metal poor gas 
dilutes the galaxyâ€™s metallicity and sustains star formation. The Closed Box Model [81, 82] 
assumes negligible gas inflow or outflow, metals accumulate over time from stellar evolution 
inside the galaxy.  This is compared to the averaged observational data for metallicity curves of 
spiral galaxies [83, 84], principally from the Milky Way [85, 86] and M81 (NGC 3031) [87 ] 
which is a nearby (11.8 Mly) grand design spiral.  
4. Conclusion 
The use of the MvdW EoS provides a framework for examining the production of heavy 
elements in diverse galactic environments. This EoS captures critical physical effects in high-
density, high-temperature conditions, such as those found in neutron star mergers, kilonovae 
events, and supernovae ejecta. By integrating this EoS into opacity expressions, we achieve an 
intuitive representation of photon and neutrino interactions with matter, which directly influence 
nucleosynthesis pathways in the r and s processes. 
Our analysis demonstrates that galaxy types exhibit distinct heavy element production profiles 
that are impacted by neutrino  masses: spiral galaxies sustain steady heavy element production 
due to their continuous star formation histories, leading to cumulative enrichment of both r- and 
s-process isotopes, elliptical galaxies show a rapid early peak in heavy element yields, dominated 
by their initial starburst, followed by a plateau as star formation ceases, dwarf galaxies exhibit 
episodic production, reflecting their bursty star formation and feedback cycles, with pronounced 
variability in r-process yields. 
Neutrino masses or oscillations play a pivotal role in shaping r-process yields by enhancing 
neutron-rich conditions, particularly in high-density environments. This effect is most significant 
in spiral galaxies where the new star production rate is active over a long period enhancing r-
process production at the end of the stellar life cycle. Neutrino oscillations play a crucial role in 
determining the yields of heavy elements by altering the neutron-richness of astrophysical 
environments, shifting the balance between light and heavy isotopes, profoundly impacting the 
chemical evolution of galaxies and the universe. As such massive neutrino physics is important 
for accurately modeling the synthesis and evolution of heavy elements. These results have 
significant implications for understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies and the cosmic 
distribution of elements, highlighting the importance of combining detailed nuclear physics with 
astrophysical simulations. 
This study demonstrates the critical role of the MvdW EoS parameters (a, b) and neutrino mass 
values in shaping r- and s-process nucleosynthesis across galaxy types and in kilonovae. High bi 
values more closely describe the r-process dominance in the galaxy like Reticulum II [88, 89], 
while moderate aij balances spiral galaxy heavy element abundances. Neutrino masses suppress 
neutron cross sections, reducing elemental abundances in all galactic types and delay heavy 
element nucleosynthesis. These findings align theoretical predictions based on using the MvdW
