and i, j = 1 . . . m, C2(Rm) ∈R. The structure constant
of SU(2) is given by the 3-dimensional fully antisymmetric epsilon tensor ǫabc, which also
deﬁnes the adjoint representation,
T a(A)bc = −i(ǫa)bc,
(2.5)
with the corresponding Casimir operator,
(T a(A)T a(A))bc = CAδbc = 2δbc.
(2.6)
We note in passing that the usual requirement on the matter content of any chiral gauge
theory to be chosen such that the gauge anomaly vanishes here is fulﬁlled by construction
since SU(2) is free of perturbative anomalies owing to the vanishing of the fully-symmetric
rank-3 tensor dabc
Rm = 0 for any irreducible Rm.

Deﬁnition of the DReg Lagrangian and BRST breaking
As discussed e.g. in Refs. [20, 26] there is no unique extension of a 4-dimensional Lag-
rangian to D dimensions. If the physical fermions are all right-handed, as here and in
Ref. [20], we have to additionally introduce sterile left-handed ﬁelds to render the kin-
etic fermion term fully D-dimensional and to obtain a D-dimensional regularized fermion
propagator in Feynman diagrams. The D-dimensional continuation of the interaction with
the gauge boson admits several valid options, but we opt for the purely 4-dimensional
coupling as in [15, 20, 21, 23]. Refs. [24, 25] and [26] have studied successively wider sets
of alternative options for deﬁnition of the D-dimensional Lagrangian. In the language
of [26] we choose option 2b without evanescent gauge couplings and with purely right-
handed 4-dimensional pieces. This choice is motivated since it has been shown to lead to
the simplest structure of the breaking of BRST invariance and thus the simplest form of
the symmetry-restoring counterterms.
With these choices the fermion Lagrangian takes the familiar form
Lfermion
kin+int = iψi/∂ψi + gT a
Rij ψRi /G
aψRj
= iψRib/∂ψLi + iψLib/∂ψRi + iψLi/∂ψLi + ψRi /DRijψRj,
(2.7)
where the purely 4-dimensional right-handed part has been written with the covariant
derivative
Dµ
Rij = ∂µδij −igT a
RijGaµ,
(2.8)
whereas the additional terms in the second line result from the mismatch between D-
dimensional derivative and 4-dimensional gauge ﬁeld in the ﬁrst line. The sterile left-
handed ﬁelds have zero BRST transformations but transform under global gauge trans-
formations such as to ensure charge conservation.
The full Lagrangian also contains the gauge part, ghosts, gauge-ﬁxing and external
sources (cf. [20]),
Lcl = Lfermion
kin+int + Lgauge + Lghost + Lg−ﬁx + Lext.
(2.9)
The pure gauge boson part is given by
Lgauge = −1
