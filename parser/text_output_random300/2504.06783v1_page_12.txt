Fig.4 | The response of NADW on major volcanic eruptions in the 2nd half of 20th Century. a–c, Distribution 
of sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) during the periods of 1963–1965 (a), 1982–1985 (b) and 1991–1995 
(c) for observation (OBS). These three global SST cooling periods correspond respectively to the three major 
volcanic eruptions of the second half of the 20th Century, namely Mt. Agung (1963), Mt. El Chichon (1982), and 
Mt. Pinatubo (1991) [43]. d, Time series of 5–20-yr band-pass filtering NASSTr (see Text S3d for the definition) 
for OBS (black-solid, °C) and 2–20-yr band-pass filtering normalized North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) for EN4 
(red-solid). The times of the three volcanic eruptions events are marked by light-green straight lines. The red-dashed 
curve is obtained by shifting the red-solid curve backward by 28 months and each dashed-grey line marks an 
opposite phase between the lagged-NADW and NASSTr. e, 5–20-yr band-pass filtering NASSTr and NADW during 
1980–2000. f, Lag-correlation relationship between NADW and NASSTr in e. g–h, Atmospheric mean meridional 
circulation (AMMC) anomaly distributions during1963–1965 (g) and 1911–1995 (h).
