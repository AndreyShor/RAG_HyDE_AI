Theorem III.6. Let A ∈Cn×n, T > 0, and the parameters m and k ≥3 be chosen such that
I −e−iAhRi

∀i = 1, . . . , m,

where h = T/m. Denoting by κ the condition number of Lm,k,p(Ah). Then
1. if A is Hermitian and negative semi-definite, then
Lm,k,p(Ah)−1

and

where C(A) := maxt∈[0,T ] ∥exp(At)∥2.
In summary, both of the two cases lead to

Remark III.7. One advantage of the Padé approximation over the Taylor approximation is that when A
is Hermitian and negative semi-definite, the spectral norm of the inverse of Wk(Ah) and Lm,k,p(Ah) are
independent of ∥Ah∥2. In contrast, for their counterparts, Mk(Ah) and Cm,k,p(Ah), the spectral norms may
grow exponentially with ∥Ah∥2. To illustrate this, observe that

Block-encoding of Lm,k,p(Ah)
In this section, we implement the block-encoding of Lm,k,p(Ah).
The definition of block-encoding is
provided in Appendix B. We assume:
• The parameters n, m, k + 1, and p are powers of two, specifically n = 2n, m = 2m, k + 1 = 2k, and
p = m · (k + 1) = 2m+k. The corresponding registers are denoted as |·⟩n, |·⟩m, and |·⟩k, where the
subscript indicates the number of qubits in this register. Additionally, a superscript a denotes that the
register contains ancilla qubits.
