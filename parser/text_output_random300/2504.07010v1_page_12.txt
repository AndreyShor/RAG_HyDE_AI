The practical use of the bound is limited because we cannot estimate dTV(An, AN+1),
n = 1, . . . , N, without knowing all noise sources of the test device or having
samples from the noiseless outputs, YN+1. Two orthogonal general strategies
have been proposed to mitigate similar non-exchangeability issues, sample
reweighting, e.g. the Mondrian Conformal Prediction algorithm of Bostr¨om
and Johansson (2020) and the localization approaches of Tibshirani et al.
(2019) and Guan (2023), and calibration training, where the calibration
score function is trained to account for possible object-conditional variabil-
ity.
2. These and follow-up works focus on establishing CP-conditional va-
lidity instead of addressing general shifts between the calibration and test
distributions. Replacing CP marginal validity (6) with an exact or approx-
imate input-conditional version of it is challenging and, in general, prac-
tically unachievable (Vovk, 2012).
Assuming there exists a feature map,
Z = ϕ(ˆY ) ∈Z, defined for any ˆY , i.e. for any QC device, estimating an
upper bound of the BC between the noisy and noiseless outputs of classi-
cally intractable circuits would be equivalent to finding a quantile function
Q : Z ⊗(0, 1) →[0, 1], such that

where Zn = ϕ(ˆYn) are the features of the n-th device. In particular, (14)
would automatically provide valid noise quantification for large devices by
setting z = ZN+1 at test time. In the Quantum Supremacy regime, however,
this is impossible because circuits with z = ZN+1 are classically intractable
2The latter approach was initiated by Papadopoulos et al. (2008) in 2028 but has
been rarely exploited fully or investigated further. See Colombo (2024) for a more recent
example.
