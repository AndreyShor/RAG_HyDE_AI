5. Semi-Device-independent Quantum Key Distribution
The implementation of fully DI-QKD schemes is hampered by the stringent hardware requirements
that limit, nowadays, a reasonable and practical key rate. One way to make DI methods more viable is to
slightly relax the notion of device independence, and establish a minimal set of reasonable assumptions.
This approach, named semi-device-independent (SDI) QKD reduces hardware demands, so that a more
reasonable key ( or randomness) rate can be achieved with current technology [94]. Examples of these
additional assumptions include (i) an upper bound on the system’s dimension [94], (ii) shared randomness
[298], or (iii) honest construction of part of the device [299]. Still other approaches within the general
semi-DI philosophy include measurement-device independent (MDI) QKD [96] and one-sided DI-QKD
(1SDI-QKD) [95]. In the following sections, we present these methods.
5.1. Prepare-Measure semi-device-independence
In DI-QKD protocols, the security is based on testing non-locality between two parties. One question
that can arise is whether such a strong form of security could be established for prepare and measure
scenarios. This question is especially important since many commercially available QKD systems operate
in one-way configurations, in which a transmitter (Alice) prepares a quantum state and sends it to a
receiver (Bob). This question was first addressed by Paw lowski and Brunner in 2011 [94], in a scenario
which they called semi-DI (SDI). In their approach, the Hilbert space dimension of the quantum system
is known, but the quantum preparation and measurement devices are uncharacterized, such that the
devices of Alice and Bob can be seen as black boxes. The assumptions of the SDI protocols are the
following:
SDI-QKD scenario [94]
1. Alice’s black box is a “state preparator” which has the freedom to choose among a certain set of
preparations ρa ∈B(Cd) with a ∈{1, . . . , N} unentangled from Eve 15, but knows nothing about these
quantum states apart from their dimensionality. She sends the prepared state to Bob.
2. Bob’s measurement device is a black box. He can choose to perform an uncharacterized measurement
My with y ∈{1, . . . , m} and gets the outcome b ∈{1, . . . , k}.
3. The boxes may feature shared classical variables λ, known to Eve, but uncorrelated from the choice
of preparation (measurement) made by Alice (Bob).
4. After repeating this procedure many times, Alice and Bob can estimate the probability distributions
P(b|a, y) = Tr(ρaM b
y) which denotes the probability of Bob finding outcome b when he performed
measurement My and Alice prepared ρa.
5. The protocol is restricted to individual attacks.
To prove the security of SDI-QKD from the table of probabilities P(b|a, y), a dimension witness can
be used to estimate the minimal dimension of the state sent from Alice to Bob. Introduced by Gallego
et al. [58], a dimension witness is defined as W = P
a,y,b wabyP(b|ay), where the real coefficients w are
chosen such that one can derive lower bounds on the dimension of classical or quantum systems that is
necessary to reproduce the measurement data. For example, in the simplest case of a two-dimensional
system with three preparations and two binary measurements, for a classical system (i.e., a bit), they
derived the witness I3:
I3 = |E11 + E12 + E21 −E22 −E31| ≤3,
(152)
where Eij = P(b = +1|ij) −P(b = −1|ij).
To surpass the upper bound with a classical system,
dimension of at least three (trits) is required, giving an algebraic maximum of I3 = 5. Looking now to
the quantum case, the same witness can be employed. After solving the maximization problem, one finds
that max|ψ⟩∈H2I3 = 1 + 2
√
2, and the witness takes the form I3 ≤1 + 2
√
2.
The first four terms in (152) can be seen as a CHSH inequality (whose maximum is 2
√
2), and the
maximization does not involve the fifth term (E31), which can be set to −1. Thus, the violation of (152)
corresponds to the violation of the CHSH inequality and can be seen as a device-independent protocol
15Notice that if Alice’s preparations were entangled with Eve’s system, then the communication capacity would be
effectively doubled using dense coding [300].
