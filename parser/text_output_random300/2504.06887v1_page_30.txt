Notably, the presence of the anti-Hawking effect, which enhances entanglement, depends on the choice of the interaction
Hamiltonian. The explicit role of the effective potential, curvature, and kinematics in the anti-Hawking effect remains
an open possibility.

Appendix A
Computing the two point function W α
ψ
In this appendix, we aim to compute the following normal ordered two-point function for the scalar density of the
Fermionic field in the (1+1) dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime:
W α
ψ (x, x′) = ⟨0α| : ¯ψa(x)ψa(x) :: ¯ψb(x′)ψb(x′) : |0α⟩,
(98)
where each repeated spinor index is summed over [40; 80]. The index α is used to denote vacua which is being used. It
is known that in two dimensions, the conformal anomaly, as well as Hawking flux, are identical for fields with spins of 0
and 1/2, as discussed in reference [54]. Also, there is no gravitational anomaly for the Fermionic field in 1+1 spacetime
dimensions[52]. Decomposing the field into positive and negative frequency parts and using normal ordering [40; 80], we
get
W α
ψ (x, x′) = ⟨0α| ¯ψ+
a (x)ψ+
a (x) ¯ψ−

Here, we have used ⟨0α|ψ−
b = 0 , ψ+
a |0α⟩= 0 in the third line and Eq.(11) with m =0 in the in the 6th line. In the last
line, we have used the fact that W α
ϕ is a scalar to write the spinor covariant derivative as a partial derivative and the
identity
Tr[˜γµ(x)˜γν(x′)] = Tr[b.µ

to evaluate the trace. Here, Nd represents the dimensionality of the spacetime, which is 2 in our case, b(..) represents
2-bein and W α
ϕ represents Wightman’s function of a scalar field in the corresponding vacua. It’s given by [54]
W Boulware
ϕ
= −1
4π ln [−Λ2(∆u −iϵ)(∆v −iϵ)]
(100)
W Unruh
ϕ
= −1
4π ln [−Λ2(∆U −iϵ)(∆v −iϵ)]
(101)
W HHI
ϕ
= −1
4π ln [−Λ2(∆U −iϵ)(∆V −iϵ)]
(102)
where, Λ > 0 is an IR cutoff.
Since the two-point function for the scalar density of the massless spin-1/2 field is
infrared-safe, we can ignore the parameter Λ for further calculations.
