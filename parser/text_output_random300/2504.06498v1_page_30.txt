Figure S7: The 𝐽-oscillators operating on heterocycles generate ultralow frequency signals.
(A) [15N3]-metronidazole oscillator acquired with 𝐺ext = 2000 and 𝜏= 140 ms; (B) 4-amino[15N]-
pyridine oscillator acquired with 𝐺ext = 1500 and 𝜏= 130 ms. Insets in both panels show the
Fourier Transform of the oscillator signal over the 20–120 s time window.
