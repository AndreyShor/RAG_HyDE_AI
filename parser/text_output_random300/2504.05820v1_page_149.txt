the underlying theory and lead to an uncertainty in the prediction which is smaller than that of
the original data. The value of ϕ obtained in the NLO, NNLO, and aN3LO NNPDF4.0 fits with
and without MHOUs (as in Table 4.3) is reported in Table 4.4. It is clear that ϕ converges to
very similar values with the increase of the perturbative order and/or with inclusion of MHOUs
for both the total dataset and for most of the data categories. This fact is further quantitative
evidence of the perturbative convergence of the PDF uncertainties.
4.3.4. Implications for intrinsic charm
The availability of the aN3LO PDFs discussed in Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 allows us to revisit and
consolidate our results on intrinsic charm (cf. Chapter 3). Specifically, based on the NNPDF4.0
NNLO PDF determination, we have found evidence for intrinsic charm Section 3.2 and an
indication for a non-vanishing valence charm component Section 3.3. In these analyses, the
dominant source of theory uncertainty was estimated to come from the matching conditions
that are used in order to obtain PDFs in a three-flavor charm decoupling scheme from high-
scale data, while MHOUs were assumed to be subdominant. The uncertainty in the matching
conditions was in turn estimated by comparing results obtained using NNLO matching and the
best available aN3LO matching conditions, both applied to NNLO PDFs.
It is now possible to improve these results on three counts. First, we can now fully include
MHOUs. Second, we can consistently combine aN3LO matching conditions and aN3LO PDFs,
and perform a consistent comparison of NNLO and aN3LO results. Finally, knowledge of aN3LO
matching conditions themselves is now improved thanks to recent results [101] that were not
available at the time of the analysis of Ref. [1]. We will specifically discuss the determination of
the total intrinsic charm component and we do not consider the valence component, because
effects of MHOUs and of the flavor scheme transformation are already very small at NNLO [2].
