LHCb simulation
Figure 2: Correlation between reconstructed (q2) and true (q2
true) values of the dilepton mass
squared in simulated B0
s →ϕe+e−decays. The distribution is normalised such that, at a fixed
value of q2
true, the migration probability in bins of reconstructed q2 sums to unity. The true
value is determined from the B0
s and ϕ meson four-momenta and does not include effects from
final-state radiation. The red line corresponds to reconstructed q2 = q2
true.

Detector and simulation
The LHCb detector [24–26] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudora-
pidity range 2 < η < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The
detector elements that are particularly relevant for this analysis are: a silicon-strip vertex
detector surrounding the proton-proton interaction region that allows c and b hadrons to be
identified from their characteristically long flight distance; a tracking system that provides
a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles; two ring-imaging Cherenkov
detectors that are able to discriminate between different species of charged hadrons; an
electromagnetic calorimeter to reconstruct electrons and photons energy deposits; and
a muon system to identify muons. Energy loss from the electrons by bremsstrahlung is
recovered using a dedicated algorithm, which associates energy in the calorimeter to the
electrons based on their trajectories. Events are selected online using a trigger [27,28]
that consists of a hardware and a software stage.
Simulated samples are used to determine the efficiency of the candidate selection as
well as the distributions of specific sources of background. In the simulation, proton-proton
collisions are generated using Pythia [29] with a specific LHCb configuration [30]. Decays
of unstable particles are described by EvtGen [31], using Photos [32] to generate final-
state radiation from the electrons and kaons. Simulated B0
s →ϕe+e−decays are generated
according to two models: a SM-like model based on Refs. [21,33,34]; and a model that is
uniform in q2 and the decay angles. The interactions of the generated particles with the
detector, and its response, are simulated using the Geant4 toolkit [35] as described in
Ref. [36]. The simulated samples are corrected to account for known differences between
