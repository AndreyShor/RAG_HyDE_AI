with fixed endpoints.Lift M to a principal U(1)-bundle
P(M, U(1)). For non-closed paths γ ∈C(M; ∂M), de-
fine the stratified Berry connection:
Aµ(λ) = i ⟨ψ(λ)|∂µψ(λ)⟩+ κµ(λ),
(22)
where the compensating field κµ satisfies:
I
γ
κµdλµ = 0
(ensures gauge invariance).
(23)
The Berry curvature is:
Fµν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ.
The role of the compensating field is to offset the effects
of gauge transformations on physical quantities, ensuring
that geometric phases, path integrals, etc., are indepen-
dent of frame choice. In supplemental materials , we had
discussed that regardless of U(1),SU(2) or others, the rel-
ative gauge invariance is satisfied. In quantum anomaly
systems, we utilize the Wess-Zumino-Witten term to can-
cel anomaly terms, as produced in the supplemental ma-
terials.
The parameter space undergoes dynamical perturba-
tions due to environmental random noise, and it is likely
that these changes are not negligible. Consider the non-
equilibrium statistics during the quantum evolution pro-
cess caused by these changes, under stochastic driving
˙λ = f(λ) + ξ(t) with ⟨ξ(t)ξ(t′)⟩= Tδ(t −t′), the path

whereF(t) = Fµν ˙λ, modifies the Langevin equation:µ

(26)
The larger the topological friction coefficient, the
slower the system’s response to parameter changes, and
the more significant the energy dissipation. The topo-
logical friction coefficient is directly related to the Berry
curvature, indicating the contribution of topological ef-
fects to energy dissipation.
While further elaborating on the gauge invariance of
non-adiabatic, non-closed quasi-topology.(as produced in
supplemental materials), our calculations reveal that the
Berry curvature of non-closed paths with AGP potentials
is equivalent to the field strength of Yang-Mills fields:
The corrected Berry curvature is
Fµν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ + i[Aµ, Aν]
(27)
The field strength of Yang-Mills fields is
F Y M
µν
= ∂µAν −∂νAµ + i[Aµ, Aν]
(28)
This
result
indicates
that
non-adiabatic
non-closed
paths also possess strong symmetry.
This suggests
that quasi-topology can be utilized to add or reduce
redundant degrees of freedom in the system, ensuring
that observable quantities are independent of these
degrees of freedom, and making it possible for divergent
terms arising from non-closed paths to be renormalized.
Additionally,
we find that different values of νqua
correspond to distinct quantum effects, as shown in the
Table below.
A detailed discussion is provided in the
supplementary materials.

Applying Parameter Space Reconstruction and Path
Dynamic Modulation to Rydberg Atom Systems—Dipole-
dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms can reach
the micrometer scale, making them suitable for simulat-
ing topological states (e.g., topological superconductors,
quantum spin liquids) [18–22].
The evolution of states in the Rydberg atom system in-
volves transitions from the ground state to intermediate
excited states and ultimately to Rydberg states. While
atoms can transition directly from the ground state to
the Rydberg state, they may also undergo a two-step
process: transitioning from the ground state to an in-
termediate excited state and then from the intermediate
excited state to the Rydberg state. Typically, the topo-
logical properties of these two distinct pathways are not
equivalent. However, by carefully adjusting the param-
eter evolution path, we can effectively shield the influ-
ence of intermediate states. Correct the mass term in
the Hamiltonian of a Rydberg atom chain.

where (Ωc, ∆c) is the center of the critical region, and
R is the radius. We can control the path shape using
time-dependent Ω(t) and ∆(t).
Below, we present a specific implementation plan for
parameter tuning. First, We design state 1 is the ground
state (e.g., 5S state, energy E1),state 2 is the intermedi-
ate excited state (e.g., 5P state, energy E2),and state 3
is the Rydberg state (e.g., 50S state, energy E3).
