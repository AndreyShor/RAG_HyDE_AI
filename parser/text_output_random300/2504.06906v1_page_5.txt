Using the fact that the spectral norm of a Kronecker
product is the product of the spectral norms of each fac-
tor [56] we write
|| ˆN n−1

With the spectral response strengths [Eq. (17)] of sys-
tems A and B, ξA = ||ˆnnA−1

find for the spectral response strength of the EP in the
composite system
ξ =

(nA −1)!(nB −1)!ξAξB.
(33)
This is the second key result of this paper.
It allows
a straightforward computation of the spectral response
strength of the leading-order EP in the composite system
once the spectral response strengths of the leading-order
EPs in the individual systems are known.

Multipartite systems
The results of the previous subsections can be straight-
forwardly generalized to systems consisting of N ≥2 sys-
tems. Again our basic assumptions are that each system
labeled here by α is completely degenerate and exhibits
a dominant EP of order nα; both EPs shall have the
same eigenvalue E0. We denote the traceless part of the
Hamiltonian ˆHα by ˆnα. In accordance with the reasoning
outlined in subsection IV B we find that the composite
system has an EP with eigenvalue NE0 and with the
multinominal coefficient we get
ˆN n−1

(n −1)!

where n := 1+P
α(nα−1). Hence, the composite system
exhibits a dominant EP of order
n = 1 +
N
X
α=1
(nα −1).
(35)
This result is consistent with Refs. [51, 62] which treated
the special case where all EPs are of second order. For
the EP eigenstate we find
|ψEP⟩=
N
O
α=1
|ψα⟩
(36)
where |ψα⟩is the leading-order EP-eigenstate of ˆHα.
Again, we exploit that the spectral norm of a Kro-
necker product is the product of the spectral norms of
each factor [56] to obtain from Eq. (34) the spectral re-
sponse strength of the EP [Eq. (17)] in the composite
system

Here ξα = ||ˆnnα−1

the respective individual leading-order EP.

DYNAMICS
In this section we demonstrate that the dynamics in a
composite system made of degenerate systems with eigen-
value E0 and EPs give raise to an interesting and coun-
terintuitive effect. As discussed in the previous sections,
the Hamiltonian ˆH of the composite system exhibits a
dominant EP with order n, eigenstate |ψEP⟩, and eigen-
value EEP = NE0.
We consider in the following the non-unitary time-
evolution operator
ˆK(t) := e−i
ℏˆ
Ht
(38)
which maps the initial state |ψ(0)⟩to the time-evolved
state |ψ(t)⟩= ˆK(t)|ψ(0)⟩. We again define the traceless
part of the Hamiltonian ˆH′ as in Eg. (20). In Sec. IV B it
was shown that ˆH′ is nilpotent of order n. This implies
that the expansion of the following exponential function
is truncated to its first n terms
e−i
ℏˆ
H′t =
n−1
X
j=0
1
j!

−i
ℏ
ˆH′t
j
.
(39)
Next, using the fact that all eigenvalues of ˆH are equal
to EEP we can write the time-evolution operator as
ˆK(t) = e−i EEP
ℏ
t
n−1
X
j=0
(−it)j
j!ℏj
ˆH′j.
(40)
For a generic initial state, the relevant term for long
times t is
ˆK(t) = e−i EEP
ℏ
t
(−it)n−1
(n −1)!ℏn−1 ˆH′n−1.
(41)
This result is in line with the studies of dynamics at EPs
in Refs. [39, 63].
Next, we use again the fact that the image of ˆH′n−1
is the eigenstate |ψEP⟩, which is a tensor product of the
EP states of the subsystems; see Eq. (36).
Hence for
long times the image of ˆK(t) approaches |ψEP⟩. This let
us conclude that the state of the composite system |ψ⟩
approaches the state of the dominant EP. Remarkable is
that the dynamics in general starts with an entangled
state but ends in a non-entangled state.
We call this
effect EP-induced disentanglement.
It is important to
emphasis that this effect is not related to the exceptional
phase transition at an EP observed in Ref. [32] and is not
in contradiction with Ref. [47] reporting a speeding up of
entanglement near an EP.
To better illustrate this, we refer to our example in
Sec. III. To be more specific, we consider Eqs. (1) and (8).
