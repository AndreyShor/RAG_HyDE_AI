Figure 4: Opacity proﬁles in the bulk of the radiative zone for the three main contributors
to opacity at the BCZ, namely oxygen, neon and iron for the seismic thermodynamical
path. Right panel: SCO-RCG, OPLIB and OP values using AAG21 abundances. Left panel:

portant elements at the BCZ, namely iron, neon and oxygen for SCO-RCG, OPAS21 (the latest
version of the code), OPLIB and OP (version 3.3), the latter being used for the latest stan-
dard solar models60. These results are shown in Figure 4 for the exact same thermodynamical
conditions of the seismic model as in Figure 3.
Comparing the left and right panels in Figure 4 shows the impact of the neon abundance re-
vision, noted previously53;20. For other elements, we compare in the right panel OPLIB, OP
and SCO-RCG, that used the exact same thermodynamical conditions. We ﬁnd that SCO-RCG
always shows signiﬁcantly higher opacities than both OP and OPLIB, neon and oxygen show-
ing large increases even at high temperatures. Thus, a model using SCO-RCG opacities might
show a high helium abundance and central temperature, altering the predicted neutrino ﬂuxes.
