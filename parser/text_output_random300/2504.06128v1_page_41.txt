Combining (5.33) with (5.32) then gives (5.31) with c :“ a{p1 ` a`{ηq.

Appendix A. Second moment computations
We first prove Lemma 2.1 about Green’s functions. Then we prove Proposition 2.3 on the
second moment of the point-to-plane partition function. Finally, we prove Theorem 2.5 on
the variance of the averaged partition function, together with Propositions 2.7 and 2.8.
Proof of Lemma 2.1. From (2.8), we see that Gpaq “

2π logp1 ` a´2q ` Op1q uniformly
over a ą 0. This already proves the second equality in (2.9). To prove the first equality, we
plug the first line of (2.3) into (2.5) to get

(A.1)
We can replace gnpzq “ gnp|z|q by gnp|z| ` 1q, because their difference is Opn´3{2q and can
be absorbed in the Op1q term. We next write

By direct computation we see that |Bugupxq| ď

For the terms n ě 2 in ∆Lpxq, we simply use |Bugupxq| ď

We finally prove (2.10), for which we may assume that z ‰ 0 and L is large enough. By
the second line of (2.3), uniformly over |z|2 ď 2p1 ` t2qn we can write, for a suitable c ą 0,
