Using the earlier inequality, this leads to:
PB(a0) + PE(a1) ≤5 +

.
A similar inequality can be derived by interchanging a0 and a1. This illustrates that when Eve attempts
to guess a different bit than Bob, she will inevitably disturb Bob’s statistical outcomes. From inequality
PB(a0) + PE(a1) ≤5+
√

and its symmetry with respect to a0 and a1, we conclude:
PB + PE ≤5 +

This implies that PB > PE if:

≈0.8415.
When Bob uses measurement operators (σx ± σz)/

2, PB ∼0.8536 and the key rate is
r = I(A : B) −I(A : E) ≈0.0581.
An additional conclusion can be drawn from the discussion above. In DI-QKD, nonlocality is necessary
but not sufficient [70] (see 4.5).
Similarly, we can deduce the analogous result: mere violation of a
dimension witness (S > 2 =⇒PB > 3/4) is not sufficient to guarantee the security of SDI-QKD.
In the ideal scenario where perfect detectors are assumed, meaning all systems leaving Alice’s labo-
ratory are detected by Bob, PB is the sole security parameter. However, in the presence of losses, the
average detection efficiency of Bob’s detectors, denoted as ηB, becomes an additional security parameter.
It is crucial to define how the parties handle rounds where no particle is detected. Chaturvedi et al. [302]
chose the simplest case, where no-detection rounds are discarded from the statistics. This choice allows
the parties to estimate the average success probability close to the optimal one in [94]. If we split Bob’s
detection efficiency as ηB = η + η′, where η = P(Click|e ̸= b) represents the detection efficiency when
Eve’s and Bob’s inputs are different, and η′ corresponds to the case where their inputs are the same, then
Eve maximizes η′ because she wants Bob’s device to return outcomes as often as possible. Since Eve has
no control over Bob’s setting, this leads to ηB = 1+η
2 . Therefore, the condition for establishing a secret
key is translated to
PB(η) > PE(η).

Chaturvedi et al. [302] studied security against two types of quantum eavesdroppers, those with and
without access to quantum memory. They showed that, in the general case where Eve could control both
Alice’s and Bob’s devices, the security condition for both cases (with and without memory) is
PB > 1

Moreover, they considered a minimal characterization of the preparation device, with the restriction
that, while Eve can choose the states that leave Alice’s laboratory, she cannot alter them during the
protocol. This is a reasonable assumption, as manipulations inside Alice’s laboratory are significantly
more difficult for Eve. They found that the optimal states are mutually unbiased bases, and the security
condition in this case is
PB > 1

. The fact that these conditions are the same for both cases, with and
without memory, proves that access to a small quantum memory (a qubit) does not help the eavesdropper
in attacking the SDI-QKD protocol.
Additionally, as a straightforward generalization of the original protocol [94], Chaturvedi et al. [302]
presented a modified SDI-QKD protocol based on the (3 →1) scenario. In this protocol, Alice is given
three bits, and depending on them, she prepares a state and sends it to Bob, who has as input a classical
trit b ∈{0, 1, 2} to select his measurement. Although the generalized protocol has lower key rates, the
security requirements are significantly reduced.
