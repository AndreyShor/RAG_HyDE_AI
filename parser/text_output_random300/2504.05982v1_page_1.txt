Abstract
Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used across chemistry, physics, and bi-
ology, providing quantitative insight into complex processes with atomic detail. How-
ever, their limited timescale of a few microseconds is a signiﬁcant obstacle in describing
phenomena such as conformational transitions of biomolecules and polymorphism in
molecular crystals. Recently, stochastic resetting, i.e., randomly stopping and restart-
ing the simulations, emerged as a powerful enhanced sampling approach, which is col-
lective variable-free, highly parallelized, and easily implemented in existing molecular
dynamics codes. Resetting expedites sampling rare events while enabling the inference
of kinetic observables of the underlying process. It can be employed as a standalone
tool or in combination with other enhanced sampling methods, such as Metadynamics,
with each technique compensating for the drawbacks of the other. Here, we comprehen-
sively describe resetting and its theoretical background, review recent developments in
