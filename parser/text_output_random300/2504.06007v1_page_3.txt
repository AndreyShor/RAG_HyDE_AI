CAMulator
Table 1: Description of input and predicted variables for CAMulator. Variables are categorized as input-only (static and
dynamic forcing), input/output (prognostic), and output-only (diagnostic). ∗Qtot is a sum of all column moisture—both
vapor and condensed: Qtot = Specific Humidity + Grid Box Snow Amount + Grid Box Rain Amount. TOA = Top of
Atmosphere.

Flux-form variables (see bold variables in Table 1) and precipitation are treated as 6-hour accumulated quantities and
rescaled so that downward fluxes are positive. Flux-form variables are essential for estimating sources and sinks in the
atmospheric moisture and energy budgets. Precipitation (PRECT) represents the total precipitation leaving the column,
including both parameterized and large-scale rain and snow. Prognostic variables are stored as 6-hourly averages. The
prognostic variable Qtot represents the total water content in the model column, including vapor and condensed phases:
specific humidity, as well as snow and rain that are present within the column.
Both static and dynamic forcing variables are included as input. Surface geopotential represents topography, while a
land-sea mask distinguishes between ocean and land grid points to ensure accurate surface-atmosphere interactions.
The model is also provided with dynamically forced (changing in time) variables, including sea surface conditions and
incoming solar radiation, updated every 6 hours. The model predicts the next atmospheric state using only the previous
time step (t), following an autoregressive formulation: t →t + ∆t.
All variables, except for the Land-Sea Mask, undergo z-score normalization, where the mean and standard deviation are
computed based on the training data period (1979–2010). The Land-Sea Mask represents the fraction of land within
each grid cell, with values ranging between 0 and 1, and is left unnormalized.
