multipartite system, classical (non-quantum) joint
states reside on the product manifold of the sub-
systems’ state spaces. For example, for two sub-
systems A and B, if each has a state space MA
and MB respectively (with dimensions dA and dB),
the combined classical state space (for independent
subsystems) is essentially MA × MB, with dimen-
sion dA + dB.
Any classical correlation can be
viewed as a probability distribution on this prod-
uct space (or a mixture of product states), which
does not increase the dimensionality of the manifold
but rather corresponds to a convex combination in
the probability simplex. Quantum entangled states,
by contrast, live in the tensor product Hilbert space
HA ⊗HB. The pure state space is then CPNAB−1
with NAB = dim(HA⊗HB) = (dim HA)·(dim HB).
This is not equivalent to the Cartesian product
of CPNA−1 and CPNB−1; rather, CPNAB−1 is a
much higher-dimensional manifold in which the set
of separable (unentangled) states forms a lower-
dimensional submanifold.
For instance, consider
two qubits: each qubit alone has a Bloch sphere
(2 real dimensions of pure state). The space of all
pure states of two qubits is CP3 (6 real dimensions).
The submanifold of product states |ψA⟩⊗|ϕB⟩is
only 4-dimensional (since we have 2 parameters for
|ψA⟩and 2 for |ϕB⟩). The remaining dimensions of
CP3 correspond precisely to entangled states that
cannot be factored into independent local descrip-
tions. In general, for n qubits, the manifold of all
pure states has real dimension 2 n+1−2, whereas the
submanifold of fully separable states has dimension
2n, growing only linearly with n. The vast gap be-
tween 2n and 2 n+1−2 (which widens exponentially
as n increases) quantifies the extensive new degrees
of freedom introduced by entanglement. These de-
grees of freedom represent non-classical correlations
that have no equivalent in any classical geometric
representation of n subsystems, except by embed-
ding into this exponentially larger quantum mani-
fold.
From a geometric standpoint, entanglement can
be viewed as a kind of curvature or warping of
the composite state space relative to the product
structure.
The shortest path (geodesic) between
two product states within the full quantum state
space may actually pass through entangled states,
indicating that the geodesics of the curved quantum
manifold do not remain on the flat product subman-
ifold.
Entangled states often maximize distances
from the product manifold: indeed, certain highly
entangled states (like Bell states for two qubits)
are as far as possible, in Fubini -Study terms, from
any separable state. This geometric perspective res-
onates with the idea of an entanglement measure:
many entanglement measures can be interpreted as
the distance of a given state to the nearest sepa-
rable state according to some metric.
For exam-
ple, the Bures distance-based entanglement mea-
sure (related to the concept of an “entanglement
distance” in recent literature) assigns zero to sepa-
rable states and grows as states become “farther”
from all product-state configurations.
All these
observations underscore that the topology and ge-
ometry of quantum state space are fundamentally
richer. QML models that exploit entanglement are
literally operating in a curved feature space of quan-
tum states that classical models (confined to prod-
uct manifolds or Euclidean feature spaces) cannot
even fully describe, let alone efficiently traverse.
In practical terms, what does this added expres-
sivity mean for machine learning? It implies that
a quantum model can represent complex relation-
ships in data with fewer explicit resources by using
entangled quantum features.
For instance, if we
encode two data points (features) x1 and x2 into
two qubits and allow them to become entangled
during a quantum circuit, the resulting state can
encode joint feature functions (like x1x2 or more
complex combinations) in the quantum amplitudes
automatically. Classically, one might need to man-
ually construct such joint features or use a network
with multiple layers to learn the interaction. Quan-
tum superposition and entanglement provide a way
to geometrically entangle these features as coordi-
nates in a high-dimensional Hilbert space, such that
simple operations (like a single rotation or mea-
surement) in that space accomplish what would be
a highly nonlinear operation in the original data
space.
In summary, by exploiting superposition
and entanglement, QML models inhabit a super-
set state space where data can be represented and
transformed in ways no classical geometric model
can natively reproduce without exponential over-
head. These uniquely quantum aspects expand the
“geometric vocabulary” available to learning algo-
rithms: not only distances and curvatures of clas-
sical manifolds, but also phases, interference pat-
terns, and global entangling rotations become avail-
able as computational resources.
