FIG. 8. Hybridization matrix elements between the origin of
the c-layer (denoted as O) and diﬀerent neighboring cell of the
f-layer, represented as the blue lines with arrows. The origin
for the c-layer will move along the x-axis while the f-layer
and thus target positions (location of arrow) are unchanged,
then the distances will change accordingly. The hybridization
matrix elements are cut-oﬀby planar distance ξ (say
√

In addition, we need to consider one hybridization el-
ement for the next nearest neighbor sites since we are
moving the c-layer along the x-axis

with
fk = eikx(1 + e−ik·⃗a1 + e−ik·⃗a2) .
