where the luminosities are evaluated with NNLO PDFs both in the numerator and in the denom-
inator. This method is computationally advantageous, and it is motivated by the factorization of
the QCD correction into the hadronic matrix element and the PDF evolution. However, as a
downside, different partonic channels ab, in Eq. (1.105), are weighted in with the same K-factor,
although this is assumption is not always well justified. Current effort are ongoing in the HEP
phenomenology community to overcome this issue and make full NNLO, PDF independent,
computations public.
We now conclude with a brief recap of the different kinematic variables for Drell-Yan and Jet
production.
Single Electroweak bosons production.
Very precise observables in hadron-hadron collision
are given by the Drell-Yan (DY) process. Similarly to DIS, single electroweak boson production
can be classified in two different channels depending on exchanged boson which are then
observed mainly through the leptonic decays.

The inclusive cross-section are usually measured as a function of the invariant mass or the
rapidity of the charged lepton (for CC, W ±) or lepton pairs (for NC, Z/γ) reconstructed in the
