for DI-QKD [267] solve these drawbacks. However, if condition (i) is satisfied the security of DI-QKD
against coherent attacks follows from security under the iid assumption.Moreover, the dependence of the
key rate on the number of rounds, n, is the same as the one in iid case, up to terms that scale like
1
√n. As
a consequence, one can extend tight results known for DI-QKD, under the iid assumption, to the most
general setting. This yields the best rates known for any protocol for a DI cryptographic task as shown
in fig. 13 for n = 1015.
4.2.1. Security of rDI-QKD with GEAT
An rDI-QKD protocol introduced in 3.8.2 mainly differs from DI-QKD in the quantum measurement
phases Mi. To see it more clearly, let’s focus on each step i. Conditioning on the input classical variables
xi, si, zi, and yi, each Mi can be described as a CPTP map Mi : QAi−1QBi−1Ei−1 →AiBiCiQAiQBiEi
that takes as input the quantum registers QAi−1 (Alice’s private measurement device A), QBi−1 (B’s
private measurement device B), and Ei−1 (Eavesdropper Eve) and outputs the classical variables Ai, Bi,
Ci along with updated quantum registers QAi,QBi, and Ei. By including the additional data in rDI-QKD
(compared to DI-QKD) i.e. random inputs Si, zi, and the outcome ci into the Eve’s side information E,
the non-signal condition in 112 remains unaffected and GEAT can be applied for the security proof of
the protocol.
An rDI-QKD protocol introduced in 3.8.2 can be shown by a tuple Qr = {ρAB, Ax, By, Tz}. which gives
rise to the correlations p(a, b|x, y) and p(a, c|x, z). Based on the above discussion, as in the standard DI-
QKD, the asymptotic key rate can be calculated by the iid Devetak-Winter rate r = H(A|XE)−H(A|B).
To lower-bound the term H(A|XE), considering that the source initially produces a state ρABE, without
loss of generality, one can assume that this state is a pure state |ΨABE⟩and all the measurement settings
are projective. The possible quantum strategies that Eve can use are fully characterized by the pure state
|ψABE⟩and the projective measurements {Aa|x},Bb|y, and Tc|z conditioned to the fact that they return
the honest correlations
p(a, c|x, z) = ⟨ΨABE| Aa|x ⊗Tc|z |ΨABE⟩,
(115)
p(a, b|x, y) = ⟨ΨABE| Aa|x ⊗Tc|z |ΨABE⟩,
where Tc|z acts jointly on subsystems B and E. To each strategy, one can associate the post-measurement
state σAXE = P
a,x p(x) |ax⟩⟨ax| ⊗σa,x
E
where σa,x
E
= trAB(|ΨABE⟩⟨ΨABE| (Aa|x ⊗IB ⊗IE)) is the
unnormalized state held by Eve conditioned to Alice’s inputs and outputs. The conditional min-entropy
can then be computed as
H(A|XE) = inf
ˆ
Q|p
H(A|XE)σAXE,
(116)
where the optimization runs over all quantum strategies ˆQ compatible with the honest correlations (115).
Notice that this optimization is almost identical to the optimization problem in a standard DI-QKD
protocol where Bob performs the measurements Tz ⊗By, with a difference that the measurements Tz
act on the joint systems BE, instead of just B. The method in section 4.4.2 (see Theorem 13) then can
be applied to lower bound the conditional entropy H(A|XE) in rDI-QKD in almost the same way as in
DI-QKD. For the rCHSH protocol which is the routed version of the DI-QKD CHSH protocol, if A and
T have perfect detectors ηA = ηB = 1, the key rats are very robust as ηB decreases, remaining positive
for ηB ≳0.68 [265]. However, this value is not robust when ηA and ηB are decreased for example, in the
case where all devices have the same detection efficiency η, the key rate is positive for η ≳0.96 which is
worse than standard CHSH based DI-QKD protocols.
4.2.2. GEAT and the security of monogamy-of-entanglement based DI-QKD
While some protocols, such as the generalized CHSH game 3.7.4 and the magic square game 3.8.3,
have also been considered, most of the protocols studied so far have been based on the CHSH game due
to its simplicity of implementation. So, here an important question arise: Is it possible to explicitly prove
secrecy of a DI-QKD protocol using an arbitrary monogamy-of-entanglement game? This question was
tackled in [254]. Let us start by defining a non-local game.
Definition 22. A two-party nonlocal game is a tuple G2 = (π, X, Y, A, B, V ), where π is a probability
distribution over input pairs (x, y) ∈X ×Y, and V : X ×Y×A×B →{0, 1} is the winning predicate. Alice
and Bob receive input (x, y), respond with output a ∈A, b ∈B, and win if V (x, y, a, b) = 1. Similarly,
a three-party game G3 is defined as one in which a third player (Eve) also contributes by receiving (x, y)
and outputs a bit c ∈{0, 1}.
