calculated from those equations, are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, both results are
consistent with one another. Notably, utilizing the SPM yields a signiﬁcantly better
resolution of the physical structures across the entire energy spectrum compared to
the WOM approach. For instance, the near-threshold structures and the secondary
peaks between the multiphoton peaks at approximately E ≃0.9 a.u. and 1.65 a.u.
are much more clearly resolved. In addition, the small oscillations still visible in the
second and third multiphoton peaks, reminiscent of the spurious high-frequency peaks
within the WOM, are entirely washed out within the SPM.

3.2. Directional emission
So far, we have analyzed the total emission spectrum without considering the emission
direction.
In one dimension, photoelectrons can be emitted either to the right
(forward, along the polarization direction ˆz) or to the left (backward). To compute
directional emission, we project the ﬁnal wavefunction onto the outgoing scattering
states Ψ(r,−)
k
(z) for emission to the right and Ψ(l,−)
k
(z) for emission to the left:

For symmetric potentials V (z), such as those considered here, Eqs. (15a) and (15b) can
be related through time-reversal symmetry: Ψ(r,+)

It follows from Eqs. (10a) and (10b) that the total spectrum is simply the sum of the
right and left contributions: (dP/dE) = (dP/dE)r + (dP/dE)l.
