3.8.2. rDI-QKD: DI-QKD based on routed Bell tests
Routed Bell tests. The current state-of-the-art combination of detection efficiency and visibility v (2b) (see
Sec.6) is achieved only for distances less than 400 m. For DI-QKD to become a widely adopted near-term
technology, operationally certifiable robust nonlocal correlations must be sustained over distances that are
orders of magnitude greater (>>100 km). Due to the high sensitivity inherent in traditional approaches
for establishing nonlocal quantum correlations, these methods prove ineffective for long-distance DI-QKD.
Consequently, developing alternative methods to establish nonlocality over large distances is essential.
An approach to extending nonlocal correlations over large distances involves generalizing standard Bell
experiments to the routed Bell experiments introduced in [247]. In a routed Bell experiment, as illustrated
in Figure 9, the measuring parties randomly select the location of their measurement in each round (the
relay R in Fig.10).
For a general quantum strategy, the correlations in a routed Bell experiment can be expressed as follows
[248]
p(a, b|x, y, i) = Tr[Ci ⊗I(ρAB)Ma|xi ⊗Mb|y] = Tr[ρAB ˜
Ma|xi ⊗Mb|y],
(76)
where Ci is the CPTP map describing the transmission of Alice’s system on the short-path (i = 0) or the
long-path (i = 1), and ˜
Ma|xi = C†
i (Ma|xi) are the elements of a valid POVM. Thus general correlation in a
routed Bell experiment coincides with those of regular bipartite Bell experiment where Alice has m0 +ml
inputs (m0 and m1 are the number of measurement settings at short-distance i = 0 and long-distance
i = 1, respectively). Various subsets of general quantum correlations (denoted as Q) then can be defined
as follows [248]:
Definition 15.
• Short-range quantum correlations: denoted as QSR, short-range quantum
(SRQ) correlations refer to the correlations achieved without the distribution of any entanglement
to A1. For these correlations, C1 is an entanglement-breaking channel C1(ρ) = P
λ Tr[Nλρ]ρλ,
where Nλ’s are the elements of a POVM. Therefore, the POVM elements of Ma|y1 are maps to
˜
Ma|x1 =
X
λ
p(a|x, λ)Nλ,
where
p(a|x, λ) = Tr[ρλMa|x1],
(77)
which is equivalent to the statement that the measurement Ma|x1 are jointly-measurable. Therefore,
the SRQ correlations can be expressed as
p(a, b|x, y, i) =
(
Tr[ρAB ˜
Ma|x0 ⊗Mb|y]
if i = 0,
P
λ p(a|x, λ)Tr[ρABNλ ⊗Mb|y]
if i = 1.
(78)
This operationally means that if the relay selects the short path i = 0, the correlations are obtained
by measuring a shared entangled state ρAB as in a regular Bell experiment. If it selects the long
