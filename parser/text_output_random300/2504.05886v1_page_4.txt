equal between species B, C, only adjusting the properties
of the (smart) species A. We also fix the reproduction
rate of species A equal to the other two (for example, we
might imagine that this rate is fixed for the organism of
interest, while the rates for predation and movement are
behavioural choices and hence easier for the individuals
to adjust). We fix the parameters ph = 0.02, H = 0.02 as-
sociated with hunger levels. Alternative values for these
parameters would change quantitatively the model be-
haviour but we expect the qualitative results of this work
to be robust.
Simulations are initialised by setting every site inde-
pendently to be either empty or to a randomly chosen
species, with probabilities
pinit(∅) = 1/2,
pinit(A) = pinit(B) = pinit(C) = 1/6
(8)
All particles have initial hunger level 0.
Lattice sizes
are either L = 120 or L = 300, a comparison of the
behaviour in these cases is useful for (qualitative) assess-
ment of finite-size effects. Note that we perform finite-
size scaling with all parameters fixed, in contrast to [7]
which took λ ∝L2.
The population of a given species is measured by its
number density ρX = NX/L2, where NX is the number
of particles belonging to species X. We write ρtotal =
ρA+ρB +ρC. In addition to particles’ species and hunger
levels, we also follow several other statistics for each par-
ticle: their age (number of MCS since birth) and their
predation/reproduction counts, which are the numbers of
times they performed the predation and reproduction ac-
tions (number of prey consumed and number of children
produced). We collect histograms of particle ages and
predation/reproduction counts at their times of death,
which may happen either spontaneously (ω) or by pre-
dation (σ).

Directional movement strategies
As discussed in Sec. I, animals perceive their immedi-
ate surroundings and adjust their behaviours accordingly.
To incorporate this behaviour in our model, we allow
the smart species A to adjust the probabilities P(D) for
the directions along which they perform actions. These
probabilities will depend on the prey and predator indi-
viduals in its neighbourhood, as well as the empty spaces
nearby, and on particles of the same species (which we
call “peer” particles). For species A, the prey is species
B and the predators are species C, recall (1). Dynam-
ics where particles choose their movement rates based on
the local environment have been studied before, see for
example [62–66].
We consider three types of behaviour for moving par-
ticles. In the simplest case, we choose one of the four
available directions at random: this is P(D) = P0(D)
with
P0(D) = (1/4)

FIG. 2.
Illustration of strategies with directional biases,
where a (smart) particle chooses to perform its action based
on the local environment. These strategies are abbreviated
as E (evade), S (spread), H (hunt) and C (cluster). If there
is no directional bias then the strategy is “non-directional”.
If all species behave identically then the strategy is “null” or
“symmetric” (under permutation).
For pure directional strategies (see below), each particle
has a preferred direction D∗based on its environment
(see below). Then we take P(D) = P1(D) with
P1(D) =
(
(1/4) + (ϕ/4),
D = D∗,
(1/4) −(ϕ/12),
D ̸= D∗.
(10)
with 0 ≤ϕ ≤3 so that ϕ is the strength of the directional
preference (it is possible to work with −1 ≤ϕ ≤3 but we
restrict to positive ϕ so that D∗is indeed the preferred
direction).
Finally, we consider mixed directional strategies in
which particles have two preferred directions D∗
1, D∗
2 with
preferences ϕ1, ϕ2. Then P(D) = P2(D) with
P2(D) = 1

where δD,D∗= 1 if D = D∗and zero otherwise, so that P2
reduces to P1 if ϕ2 = 0. For mixed strategies we require
ϕ1 + ϕ2 ≤3 and ϕ1, ϕ2 ≥0.
To assign the preferred direction(s) for a particle at
position x, we define its perception area to be a square
of side 2R+1, centred at x. See Fig. 2, which also shows
how this square is divided into four triangles, one associ-
ated with each direction D. An example pure directional
strategy is hunting (H), where the preferred direction is
assigned by counting the number of prey within each tri-
angle and taking D∗to be the direction whose triangle
has the maximal number of prey. (In case of a tie, we
take D∗to be one of the maximising directions, chosen
uniformly at random. Note also that the triangles over-
lap along the diagonals of the lattice: particles on those
