where ˆS and ˆK are the spin operators for 15N and total 1H nuclei, respectively, and 𝐽is the scalar
coupling constant. The interaction with the feedback magnetic field is modeled as:
ˆ𝑉(𝑡) = −𝐺ext · 𝐵OPM(𝑡−𝜏) · (𝛾15N ˆ𝑆y + 𝛾1H ˆ𝐾y),
(S3)
where 𝐺ext is the (external) feedback gain, 𝜏F is the externally applied the feedback delay, and
𝛾15N, 𝛾1H are gyromagnetic ratios of 15N and 1H nuclei, respectively. Consequently, we define
𝐵ext = 𝐺ext · 𝐵OPM. The field emitted from the sample as measured by an OPM, 𝐵OPM(𝑡) can be
derived from the sample’s magnetization 𝑀(𝑡):
𝐵OPM(𝑡) = −𝜇0

Here, 𝑑= 12.45 mm is the distance between the sensor cell and sample, and 𝑟= 4.2 mm is the
radius of the sample. The magnetization of the system 𝑀(𝑡) (would be along the 𝑦-axis due to the
uniaxial nature of zero-field scalar maser) is calculated as,
𝑀(𝑡) = ⟨𝛾15N ˆ𝑆y + 𝛾1H ˆ𝐾y⟩(𝑡) · ℏ𝑁A · 𝐶,
(S5)
where 𝐶= 967 mM is the [15N]-ACN concentration, and ⟨·⟩= Tr( ˆ𝜌(t)·) denote the quantum
expectation value.
Relaxation.
The relaxation superoperator incorporates intramolecular dipolar interactions, in-
termolecular interactions, and paramagnetic effects. Intramolecular relaxation is modeled using a
rotational diffusion approach for a symmetric top, with tunneling and spinning diffusion times of
0.135 ps and 3 ps, respectively. Details of the calculation method will be published elsewhere.
Intermolecular effects and paramagnetic contributions (e.g., dissolved oxygen) are treated via a
random fluctuating field model (37):

superoperator is based on the work (38).
