We find that all cases of A1, A2 and A3 predict the normal hierarchy (NH) in the neutrino
mass eigenvalues m1, m2 and m3. The inverted hierarchy (IH) is very difficult to realize for
all cases. We show, in Fig. 3, predictions on the CP violating parameter δCP in the neutrino
oscillation and the mββ for the double β decays of nuclei. In addition, we impose the positive
cosmological baryon asymmetry, YB > 0 [3] assuming the first Majorana right-handed neutrino
N1 is the lightest among the heavy right-handed neutrinos, M1 < M2, M3.
The result is
presented in Fig. 4.

The notations are same as in Fig. 3.
We see that the CP violating phase δCP is predicted in a very broad region, but the mββ
is predicted in two narrow regions, mββ ≃4meV and (8 →10)meV. It is interesting that we
can explain the correct sign of the baryon asymmetry in the present universe for M1 < M2 in
the region where the predicted δCP is consistent with the observation within the one standard
deviation 1 σ 8. We find all results in the three cases A1, A2 and A3 are almost the same.
