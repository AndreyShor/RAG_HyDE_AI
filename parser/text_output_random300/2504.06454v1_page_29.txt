8 Future perspectives
The lattice strain, manifested as a reduction in lattice parameters, and the eutectic
microstructure are eﬀective strategies for enhancing Jc at lower magnetic ﬁelds. Con-
versely, nanoscale precipitates serve as ﬂux-pinning sites under higher magnetic ﬁelds.
However, direct observation of magnetic ﬂux distribution under both low and high
ﬁelds using techniques such as magneto-optical microscopy and scanning tunneling
microscopy is essential.
In Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 and (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5, lattice strain is induced
by thermal annealing, contrasting with NbScTiZr, which exhibits lattice strain inher-
ently due to its eutectic microstructure. The as-cast NbScTiZr sample already
possesses considerable lattice strain, as evidenced by deviations from the hard-sphere
model. This strain likely originates from the structural mismatch between the bcc
and hcp phases. While the origin of lattice strain in Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 and
(TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 remains unclear, possible microstructural anomalies warrant
detailed metallographic investigation. Furthermore, determining whether lattice strain
exists in other superconducting HEAs is interesting, necessitating further exploration
