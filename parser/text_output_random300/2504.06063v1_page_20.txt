procedure to extrapolate our results to the σ 7→0 limit
(see below).
Aggregated information concerning the quality of all our
continuum extrapolations is provided in Figure 14. The
figure shows three histograms, collecting the information
on the values of three “quality variables” coming from
the continuum extrapolations of all our results for the
quark-connected contribution dΓ(p)
¯cs (σ; L⋆)/dω2, i.e. for
each value of p, σ, ω and for the two smearing kernels.
The blue bars correspond to the pull variable
Pa = |¯x −x(aE)|
∆tot
,
(100)
where ¯x again represents the result of the combined con-
tinuum extrapolation, ∆tot its error while x(aE) is the
result at the finer value of the lattice spacing (that in
our case is the one obtained on the E112 ensemble). Fig-
ure 14 shows that Pa ≤1 in more than 95% of the cases
and that we never observe Pa > 2.
This means that
(almost) all our continuum extrapolated results are com-
patible with the points at the finest lattice spacing within
one standard deviation. The orange bars correspond to
the reduced χ2 of the dominant (larger weight) fit enter-
ing the weighted average of Eq. (97). The Figure shows
that in more than 90% of the cases the dominant fit has
χ2/d.o.f ≤1. The green bars correspond to the Nparams
variable of the dominant fit. We have Nparams = 1 in
the case of the constant fit, Nparams = 2 in the case of
the linear fits and Nparams = 3 for the quadratic fits.
The figure shows that in more than 80% of the cases the
dominant fit is the constant one of the two finer points,
i.e. the one providing the larger statistical error on the
continuum extrapolated result. In summary, Figure 14
provides evidence that our continuum extrapolations are
rather flat, i.e. that we observe rather small cutoff effects
within our estimates of the statistical and HLT system-
atic errors, and makes us very confident on the quality
of our continuum extrapolations.
After having performed the continuum extrapolations
the error of the continuum results (that already takes
into account our estimates of the HLT and continuum-
extrapolation
systematic
uncertainties)
is
added
in
quadrature to our estimates of the FSE systematic er-
rors.
This allows us to neglect the dependence upon
the volume of our results and, therefore, we call them
dΓ(p)(σ)/dω2.
The last step of the analysis consists in performing the
necessary σ 7→0 extrapolations.
To this end, we use
the asymptotic formulae of Eq. (63) and consider the

separate fits of the results obtained by using respectively the
sigmoid and the error-function smearing kernels. The red line
is the combined fit of both datasets. The red point is the ex-
trapolated result and the error includes our estimate of the
systematic error associated with the extrapolation.
