Figure 4.
Parcel (dashed) and basic state (solid) profiles for varying: surface temperature (top left), surface
relative humidity (top right), radiative cooling rate (bottom left) and Rayleigh number (bottom right). Unless
otherwise stated (in the plot legend), the set of parameter values used are bsurf = 0.05, RHsurf = 0.6, r =
10−5 & Ra = 106.
The effect of increasing the radiative cooling and Rayleigh number on the con-
ditional instability is illustrated by the bottom panels of Figure 4. Since the (dashed)
parcel profile is independent of both r&Ra, changes in conditional stability are due to
changes in the basic state solution. Increases in r and Ra have the same (monotonic)
effect on conditional instability: they both cause a decrease in the LFC, increase in
the CIN and a significant increase in the pCAPE, relative to the changes in pCAPE
caused by changing bsurf or RHsurf.

Conditional Instability and Moisture Diagnostics
To examine how the basic state changes under climate change (increasing both
r &bsurf), we can compute both conditional instability diagnostics (pCAPE, CIN, LFC
& Ry), and moist diagnostics (P,zs). We define a ‘typical’ climate change scenario,
consistent with Figure 4 of Jeevanjee and Fueglistaler (2020), by assuming that the
surface relative humidity remains fixed (e.g. over an ocean surface), with the radiative
cooling doubling from ∼1K/day to ∼2K/day (increasing r from 1×10−5 to 2×10−5)
when we increase the surface temperature by ∼10K (increasing bsurf from 0.0 to 0.1).
We consider the effects of the typical climate change scenario, and alternative climate
change scenarios, on the system by computing conditional instability and moisture
