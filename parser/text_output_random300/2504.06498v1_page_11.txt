Figure 2: Feedback-delay-dependent spectral selectivity and threshold dynamics of zero-field
𝐽-oscillators. (A)-(B) Oscillator on [15N]-acetonitrile (blue) obtained with parameters 𝜏= 100 ms
and 𝐺ext = −20 demonstrates coherent generation from both 1-𝐽and 2-𝐽transitions; Fourier
filtering after processing isolates 1-𝐽oscillation (red) in (A) and 2-𝐽oscillation (orange) in (B).
Panels (C) and (D) show the steady-state (SS) amplitudes of 1-𝐽and 2-𝐽oscillation versus delay (𝜏),
with a fixed feedback gain of 𝐺ext = −20 (C) and 𝐺ext = +20 (D), respectively. Panels (E) and (F)
show the SS and maximal amplitude dependence on the feedback gain 𝐺ext for oscillators operating
exclusively on 1-𝐽(negative feedback, 𝜏= 160 ms) and 2-𝐽(positive feedback, 𝜏= 222 ms)
transitions, respectively. Shaded areas in (E) (𝐺ext < 7.2) and (F) (𝐺ext < 5.8) indicate regions
where the feedback gains fall below the threshold needed for the spontaneous oscillator emergence.
For signals not reaching steady state within 600 s, the amplitude of the last 10 s was used. Solid
lines in (C-D) are actual numerical simulations with the algorithm described in the SI.
