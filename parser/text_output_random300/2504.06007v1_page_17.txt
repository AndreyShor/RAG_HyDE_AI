Open Science
All figures in this manuscript can be reproduced using the scripts and notebooks available in the dedicated figure
repository: CAMulator Figures GitHub.
The CAMulator model itself is developed on the NSF NCAR CREDIT platform [Schreck et al., 2024] and is actively
maintained. The specific branch used for climate simulations can be accessed here: NCAR CREDIT Climate Runs

Climatological RMSE
The weighted annual climatological root mean squared error is calculated as:

Where NÏ• and NÎ» are the number of latitude (Ï•) and longitude (Î») grid cells, respectively. w (i) = cos(Ï•i) is the
latitude weighting coefficient, which is normalized such that P
i w(i) = 1, the over bar indicates that each field was
first averaged in time over the 30 year simulation run. Table A.1 shows the RMSE calculated for each single level
variable.

measurement units. The RMSE values represent the deviation of CAMulatorâ€™s 30-year climatological mean from the
climatology of the base CAM6 simulation.
