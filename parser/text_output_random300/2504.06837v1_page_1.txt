Abstract
We investigate the convergence of spatial discretizations for reaction-diﬀusion systems
with mass-action law satisfying a detailed balance condition. Considering systems on the
d-dimensional torus, we construct appropriate space-discrete processes and show conver-
gence not only on the level of solutions, but also on the level of the gradient systems
governing the evolutions. As an important step, we prove chain rule inequalities for the
reaction-diﬀusion systems as well as their discretizations, featuring a non-convex dissipa-
tion functional. The convergence is then obtained with variational methods by building
on the recently introduced notion of gradient systems in continuity equation format.

Introduction
The aim of this work is to show convergence of spatial discretizations of a class of reaction-
diﬀusion systems satisfying mass-action law. Considering ﬁnitely many species Xi with i ∈I =
{1, . . . , i∗} undergoing ﬁnitely many reactions chemical reactions labeled by r ∈R := {1, . . . , r∗}
and diﬀusing in a medium, the reaction-diﬀusion systems we are considering can in general be
written as

where ρi = ρi(t, x) describes the concentration of species Xi. The parameters characterizing
the diﬀusion are the diﬀusion coeﬃcients δi > 0 and additional continuous drift potentials Vi.
