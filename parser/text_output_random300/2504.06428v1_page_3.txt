FIG. 1: The set of simple paths (in red) for holonomies {H1, H2, H3, H4} defined with vertex 4 as the base
point and the edge connecting vertices 2 and 4 as the special edge. They satisfy the closure condition (1).
Simple paths on a tetrahedron with negative curvature are defined similarly.
and it is isomorphic to the fundamental group π1(Σ0,4) of a 4-holed sphere Σ0,4.
This isomorphism, denoted as
X : π1(sk1(tetra)) →π1(Σ0,4), leads to the fact that a flat connection in the moduli space Mflat(Σ0,4, SU(2)) ≡
Hom(π1(Σ0,4), SU(2))/SU(2) of SU(2) flat connection on Σ0,4 one-to-one corresponds to the geometry of a tetrahedron
described by the holonomies of SU(2) spin connection along the simple paths of the tetrahedron, as shown in the
following diagram.

where the quotient is by the conjugate action of SU(2).
Such an isomorphism can be generalized to a one-higher dimensional case [19]. To rephrase, (3) relates the fun-
damental group of a 3-simplex, i.e. a tetrahedron, and that of the nodes-complement of its topological boundary
S2 where the nodes are the (3-3=) 0-subcomplexes of the dual 2-complex on the boundary of the 3-simplex. Its
generalization gives the isomorphism between the fundamental group of (the one-skeleton of) a 4-simplex and that of
the graph-complement of its topological boundary S3 where the graph is the (4-3=)1-subcomplex – Γ5 graph – of the
dual 3-complex on the boundary of the 4-simplex. Denote this graph-complement 3-manifold as S3\Γ5.
To write this isomorphism exactly, let us specify the fundamental group of a 4-simplex and S3\Γ5 separately. The
generators of the former are the closed paths based at the same vertex along the 1-skeleton and circling around a
triangle. We refer to fig.2 and fix the notations as follows. We use numbers ¯1, · · · , ¯5 with bars to denote the vertices
of the 4-simplex and (¯a¯b) to denote the oriented edge that connects source ¯b to target ¯a. Denote (¯b¯a) = (¯a¯b)−1. tetraa
denotes the tetrahedron that does not contain the vertex ¯a. Each pair of tetrahedra tetraa and tetrab share a triangle
△ab (or △ba), which is the one that does not contain vertices ¯a and ¯b.
We choose ¯1 to be the base point. pab denotes the oriented closed path based at ¯1 that circles △ab and whose
orientation matches the outgoing normal of △ab in tetraa. To fix the path for triangles not attached to ¯1, which
is the case for all triangles in tetra1, we need to additionally specify a “special edge” that connects ¯1 to a vertex
on the boundary of the triangle. Two special edges are needed at the minimum. We choose (¯3¯1) to be the special
edge for triangles △12, △14, △15 and choose (¯5¯1) to be the special edge for triangle △31 on tetra3. For instance,
p12 = (¯1¯3) ◦(¯3¯5) ◦(¯5¯4) ◦(¯4¯3) ◦(¯3¯1). pba = p−1
ab holds for all (¯a¯b) ̸= (¯1¯3) or (¯3¯1). Specially,
p13 := (¯1¯3) ◦(¯3¯5) ◦(¯5¯2) ◦(¯2¯4) ◦(¯4¯5) ◦(¯5¯3) ◦(¯3¯1) ,
p31 := (¯1¯5) ◦(¯5¯4) ◦(¯4¯2) ◦(¯2¯5) ◦(¯5¯1) .
(4)
Therefore, p13 and p31 are related by
p13 = p24 ◦p−1
31 ◦p−1
24 .

The generators of the fundamental group π1(sk1((4-simplex)) of a 4-simplex are then given by the following 5
relations.
