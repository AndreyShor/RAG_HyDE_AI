FIG. 9.
The plots of this figure have been obtained by using
the same data of Figure 8. The top-panel shows the difference
between the approximated and the exact kernels for N = 43
and for the three norms α = 0, α = 1 and α = 2−.
The
coefficients that define the approximations in the plot are as-
sociated with the points in correspondence of the red vertical
dashed line in Figure 8 and, therefore, to different approxima-
tions at fixed d(p)(N; Σ) ≃0.08. The vertical dashed red and
black lines correspond to the lightest state in the spectrum,
ωmin =
q
r2
¯ss−conn + ω2, and to the parameter ωth, respec-
tively. The error in the approximation of the kernel in the
gray area, ω0 < ωth, is irrelevant for the physical result. The
vertical dotted green line corresponds to ωmax. The bottom-
panel shows the direct comparison between the approximated
and exact kernels.
on the differential decay rate. Conversely, by reducing
d(p) (N; Σ) the statistical errors rapidly increase. In the
top panel we show the data corresponding to α = 0 and
to increasingly larger values of N. As it can be seen, for
sufficiently small values of d(p) (N; Σ) and for N > 13
the results for the differential decay rate become inde-
pendent upon N within the statistical errors. This means
that by using N = 43 on this ensemble, the systematic
error associated with the N 7→∞limit is totally irrele-
vant w.r.t the statistical errors of our results. This fact is
corroborated by the results shown in the bottom-panel,
that correspond to N = 43 and to different values of the
norm parameter α. As it can be seen, there is no signifi-
cant dependence upon the choice of the norm parameter
and this is another evidence that, within the statistical
errors, the onset of the N 7→∞limit has been reached.
In order to quote the central value, the statistical er-
ror and to estimate the residual systematic error on the
differential decay rate we search for a plateau-region in
which the results do not show any significant dependence
upon d(p) (N; Σ). The absence of such a plateau-region
would prevent us from quoting a result but, in the case
of our data, a plateau-region is clearly visible for all con-
tributions, all flavor channels, all considered values of σ
and of ω. In the case shown in Figure 8, we extracted
our estimate of the physical differential decay rate, i.e.
the λ 7→0 and N 7→∞result, from the red dataset, cor-
responding to α = 0 and N = 43, that clearly exhibits
a plateau on the left of the vertical red line.
For any
point in the plateau-region the systematic error on the
differential decay rate can safely be neglected w.r.t. the
corresponding statistical error. Nevertheless, in order to
quantify a possible residual systematic error, we select
two points.
The first point, whose coefficients are de-
noted by g(p)
⋆, is selected at the beginning of the plateau-
region (the red vertical line in Figure 8). We then select
a second point, whose coefficients are denoted by g(p)
⋆⋆,
corresponding to the condition

and therefore to a (ten times) better reconstruction of
the smearing kernel (the black vertical line in Figure 8).
From these two points we obtain a conservative estimate
of the residual systematic error associated with our re-
sults as we are now going to explain.
Let us consider a given quantity O for which we have
different determinations Oi that we expect to differ by
an amount comparable to the systematic error. In order
to obtain a data-driven estimate of this systematic error
we consider the pull variables
Pij
sys = Oi −Oj
∆ij
,
(91)
where ∆ij is a conservative estimate of the error of the
difference Oi −Oj (depending upon the observable we
consider either the error of one of the terms or the sum
in quadrature of the errors of the two terms). We then
estimate the systematic error by using the formula
∆sys = max

(92)
The error-function weights the difference with a (rough)
estimate of the probability that the observed value is not
due to a fluctuation. To ensure a reliable estimate of the
systematic error, the observables Oi must have different
sensitivities to the given systematic error. For example,
in the case of FSE we considered the determinations of
our observables obtained on significantly different physi-
cal volumes.
In the case of the HLT stability analysis we estimate both
the statistical errors and the central values of our results
