where f is a functional expression linear in the susy
spinor parameter ε = ε(x). In general, one has
[δε, δε′]φ = δ[ε,ε′]φ + E(φ),
(11)
with E(φ) the ﬁeld equations of the theory, the susy
transformations closing an algebra only on-shell, i.e. for
E(φ) = 0, on the ﬁelds φ.
Now, suppose that we are able to extract from the
theory a perturbative dressing ﬁeld υ = υ[φ] s.t.
δευ ≈−ε.
(12)
We can then systematically build perturbatively dressed
ﬁelds
φυ := φ + ¯δυφ = φ + f(υ; φ).
(13)
Those are relational variables, invariant under susy trans-
formations at 1st order. Indeed, we have
δεφυ = δεφ + δεf(υ; φ)
= f(ε; φ) + f(δευ; φ) + ✘✘✘✘✘
✿neglect
δεf(υ; φ)
= f(ε; φ) −f(ε; φ) = 0,
(14)
neglecting higher-order terms.
Since all the ﬁelds in the theory shall now be dressed in
such a way as to be invariant under susy transformations,
it follows automatically that
[δε, δε′]φυ = 0,
(15)
which defuses the issue of the on-shell closure of susy
transformations on the ﬁelds, which arose when consid-
ering only bare variables (11).
In the presence of residual J -transformations of the
1st kind, the theory is not yet fully relational; these
should be reduced in an analogous manner to achieve
full relationality. The theory thus becomes a J -theory,
and the dressed ﬁelds still transform under the residual
gauge symmetries remaining after susy has been reduced
(e.g., Lorentz transformations, bosonic spacetime diﬀeo-
morphisms, etc.).
We will now examine the implications for the dynamics
of the theory, that is, for supersymmetric Lagrangians.
B.
Dressed susy Lagrangians
Let us consider the Lagrangian form L = L(φ) quasi-
invariant under the inﬁnitesimal susy transformations
(10), namely
δεL(φ) = dβ(ε; φ).
(16)
Supposing that there exists the dressing ﬁeld υ above, we
exploit the quasi-invariance of L to deﬁne, using the DFM
rule of thumb, the perturbatively dressed Lagrangian as
Lυ = L(φυ) := L(φ) + ¯δυL
= L(φ) + dβ(υ; φ).
(17)
The dressed Lagrangian Lυ is susy-invariant at 1-st order
by construction, being a functional of the dressed ﬁelds
φυ:
δεLυ = δεL + δεdβ(υ; φ)
= δεL + dβ(δευ; φ) + ✘✘✘✘✘✘
✿neglect
d β(υ; δεφ)
= dβ(ε; φ) −dβ(ε; φ) = 0.
(18)
The dressed ﬁeld equations E(φυ) = 0 are thus susy-
invariant at 1st order. They are deterministic, meaning
that they uniquely determine the evolution of the rela-
tional d.o.f. of the theory.
Observe that, in the case in which the bare Lagrangian
is strictly susy-invariant, that is β = 0, then L(φυ) =
L(φ).
In either cases, the ﬁeld equations E(φυ) = 0
for the dressed ﬁelds have the same functional expres-
sion as the ﬁeld equations for the bare ﬁelds, E(φ) = 0.
Let us also mention that in the presence of residual J -
transformations of the 1st kind, L(φυ) is a J -theory.
We remark that, at this point, one can either continue
studying the dressed theory constructed starting from
the bare one – for example, by analyzing its solutions,
performing quantization, etc. – with manifest invariance
at hand, or, alternatively, one can construct a new J -
theory from scratch using the dressed kinematical ﬁeld
variables obtained by reducing the susy transformations
(10).
C.
Susy as an oﬀ-shell invariance in N = 2, D = 4
supergravity via the DFM
We now give an application of the above to the case
of N = 2, D = 4 pure sugra.
Let us mention that,
actually, in the case of sugra things become a bit more
subtle because susy transformations correspond to diﬀeo-
morphisms along the fermionic directions of superspace.
This is made clearer in geometric approaches to susy and
sugra in superspace: See for example the so-called rheo-
nomic approach [31, 35, 36] comprehensively reviewed in
[37], or more generally the framework of Cartan super-
geometry as the mathematical foundation of sugra – see
[37] and references therein. In order to have better geo-
metric control over the procedure to be implemented via
the DFM for reducing susy in sugra one should adopt
a super-Cartan approach, that is, work with a super-
Cartan bundle. Moreover, since higher-dimensional, N-
extended sugra models typically involve higher-degree
forms (antisymmetric tensors with multiple indices), a
fully developed relational framework for sugra would re-
quire the formal development of higher Cartan super-
geometry, along with a corresponding higher DFM (in
preparation [38]).
Here we shall just consider the N = 2, D = 4 pure
sugra model as presented in [31], applying the DFM at
an elementary ﬁeld-theoretic level, which is enough to
showcase our approach to the issue of on-shell closure of
the susy transformations.
