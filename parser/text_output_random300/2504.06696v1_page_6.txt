In Eq. (20), the noise operators are defined by ˆXo,in =
(ˆo†
in + ˆoin)/
√
2, and ˆYo,in = i(ˆo†
in −ˆoin)/
√
2 for ˆoin = ˆain
and ˆbin.
The stability of the system can be analyzed by checking
the real parts of all the eigenvalues of the coefficient ma-
trix A. If all the real parts of the eigenvalues are negative,
then the system is stable. It can be seen from Eqs. (5)
that the equation could have three solutions under cer-
tain parameter conditions, corresponding to three fixed
points. If all the three fixed points satisfy the steady-
state condition, the system enters a tristable regime. If
only two fixed points satisfy the steady-state condition,
the system is bistable. This implies that the presence of
three solutions may lead the system into a multi-stable
regime.
Therefore, we exclude the case with three so-
lutions and focus on the single-solution scenario.
The
first step for clarifying the single stable solution is to dis-
tinguish between the multi-solution and single-solution
regions. The single-solution cases are then classified as
either steady or non-steady using the Routh-Hurwitz cri-
terion.
In Figs. 4(a)-4(d), we show the stability phase dia-
grams of the effective optomechanical Hamiltonian in
both the sideband resolved and unsolved regimes.
As
κa increases, the multi-valued region (green) becomes
smaller, and the single-valued unstable region (blue) ex-
pands. The single-valued stable region (orange) is only
slightly affected, with a slight reduction in the stable area
within the deeper blue sideband-parameter region. In ad-
dition, as χ increases, the single-valued stable region ex-
pands, reaching into the deep blue sideband-parameter
area.
In the following sections, we will focus on ex-
ploring optomechanical entanglement within the single-
valued stable region.
B.
The covariance matrix of the system
For the present linearized optomechanical system, its
dynamics can be well described by both the first- and
second-order moments. Considering that the first-order
moments are initially zero, they will remain zero through-
out the subsequent evolution, allowing us to neglect the
first-order moments in the following analyses.
In this
section, we derive the equations of motion of the second-
order moments and the steady-state covariance matrix
of the system.
In terms of the relation ∂t⟨ˆoiˆoj⟩=
Tr( ˙ˆρsdˆoiˆoj) for ˆoi, ˆoj ∈{ˆa, ˆa†, ˆb, ˆb†} and based on the
quantum master equation (15), we can obtain the equa-
tion of motion for these second-order moments of the
system operators as
˙X(t) = M(t)X(t) + N(t),
(21)
where X(t) = (⟨ˆa†ˆa⟩, ⟨ˆb†ˆb⟩, ⟨ˆa†ˆa†⟩, ⟨ˆaˆa⟩, ⟨ˆb†ˆb†⟩, ⟨ˆbˆb⟩, ⟨ˆa†ˆb†⟩,
⟨ˆaˆb⟩, ⟨ˆa†ˆb⟩, ⟨ˆaˆb†⟩)T ,

For studying the optomechanical entanglement, it is
more convenient to calculate the covariance matrix in the
quadrature representation. To this end, we introduce the
covariance matrix V defined by the matrix elements
Vi,j =1
2[⟨ˆui(t)ˆuj(t)⟩+ ⟨ˆuj(t)ˆui(t)⟩] −⟨ˆui(t)⟩⟨ˆuj(t)⟩,
(24)
where ui for i =1-4 are the element of the operator vec-
tor u defined in Eq. (18). The elements of the covari-
ance matrix can be further expressed as a function of the
second-order moments [57]. In the steady state of the
system, the covariance matrix takes the form as
V =
 VO
C
CT VM

,
(25)
where the matrix VO is associated with the optical mode,
VM is related to the mechanical resonator, and C char-
acterizes their interaction, which quantifies the bipartite
entanglement between the cavity field and the mechani-
cal mode. To quantity the quantum entanglement for the
Gaussian steady-state of the cavity field and mechanical
mode, we employ the logarithm negativity, which is de-
fined by [53, 54]
EN = max[0, −ln(2η−)].
