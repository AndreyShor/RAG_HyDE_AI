labeled as b1, . . . , bn, this evolution from unity to multiplicity is illustrated in Figure 1.
Furthermore, the squared norm of the various state vectors is important for our discussion
below. Decoherence theory ensures that the states ψb(τ1) are orthogonal, that is, we have

ψa(τ1)
ψb(τ1)

= 0 for all a ̸= b and a, b ∈B. And since the Schr¨odinger equation conserves
the squared norm over time, this implies that3

The branching of the state vector shown in Figure 1 occurs, for example, during a quantum
measurement by a human observer. In that case, each branch b ∈B corresponds to a diﬀer-
ent measurement outcome. But this kind of branching also happens naturally, without any
observer. Decoherence occurs continuously as quantum systems interact with their environ-
ments. These interactions act like constant measurements, causing superpositions to evolve
into stable, classical-like branches. No conscious observation is needed — the environment
itself is enough to induce the branching (see e.g. Zurek 2003; Schlosshauer 2007).
3Remember that we write

ψ1
ψ2

for the inner product of any two state vectors ψ1 and ψ2. It is often
customary in quantum mechanics to write the state vectors themselves as |ψ⟩, but we prefer the shorter
notation ψ in this paper.
