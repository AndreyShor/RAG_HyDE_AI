fovo et al., 1999). V (r) is a potential energy term, typ-
ically a trapping potential. γ is a term modeling atom
losses in the system, and has been used e.g. to describe
atom lasers (Kneer et al., 1998), but could be ignored in
most closed-system BEC experiments. The comparison
between the NLSE and the (damped) GPE enables us to
map the propagation of the envelope of the electric field
E to the time evolution of a Bose gas wavefunction ψ.
There is a key difference between the two equations
though, as the NLSE describes a propagation along the
z-axis when the GPE describes a temporal evolution.
Consequently, we can map the propagation axis to an
effective time τ = z/c. The spatial dynamics takes place
in the transverse (x, y) plane, as the kinetic energy term
involves only the derivatives along this plane.
Hence,
in this derivation for a monochromatic light field, the
NLSE describes an analogous two-dimensional photonic
Bose gas evolving along an effective time that is the prop-
agation axis. This is known as paraxial fluids of light or
fluid of light in a propagating geometry, or in 2D+1 ge-
ometry. Imaging the beam at the output of the nonlinear
medium of length L is equivalent to detecting a 2D Bose
gas that evolved during an effective time L/c. A more
detailed discussion on the dimensionality of the system
will be given in Section III.
To complete this formal analogy, we multiply Eq. (28)
by ℏand make the variable change τ = z/c. We obtain:

(31)
All terms in factor of E on the right-hand-side of Eq. (31)
have the dimension of an energy, like in the Gross-
Pitaevskii equation.
Consequently, we can extract an
analogous kinetic, potential and kinetic energy.
1. The kinetic energy term is given by the trans-
verse diffraction:
−ℏc ∇2
⊥E
2k0
↔−ℏ2
2m ∇2ψ
which enables us to define the effective mass of the
photons in the transverse plane as:
¯m = ℏ
c k0.

2. The interaction energy term is given by the non-
linear index:
−ℏc k0
nE

|E|2 ↔g|ψ|2
which defines an effective interaction coefficient
¯g = −ℏc k0

Bose gases are stable against collapse in the case
of repulsive interactions, i.e. when g > 0. For the
effective interaction term in fluids of light, this im-
plies n2 < 0. In this case, the beam experiences
self-defocusing, which is consistent with the pic-
ture of repulsive photon-photon interactions.
By
contrast, when n2 > 0 (and ¯g < 0), the beam expe-
riences self-focusing up to the point of filamentation
(Askar’Yan, 1974), which is a similar phenomenon
to the collapse of BECs with attractive interactions
(Roberts et al., 2001).
3. The potential energy term is given by the spatial
modulation of the linear index:
−ℏc k0
δn0(r)
n0
↔V (r),
which defines the effective potential
¯V (r) = −ℏc k0
δn0(r)
n0
.
Interestingly, while a trapping potential is neces-
sary in BECs to not lose the atoms due to gravity,
it is obviously not the case for fluids of light.
However it is important to note that a spatial
modulation of the linear index gives the possi-
bility to shape the potential landscape for the fluid.
4. The loss term equivalent to the linear absorption
term:
ℏc α
2 ↔γ
2 ,
which defines the effective loss term as
¯γ = ℏc α.
To map Eq. (31) to the GPE with a time-independent
potential, we assume that the susceptibility is indepen-
dent of z and therefore we set r = r⊥in the potential
term. We can now rewrite Eq. (31) as:
iℏ∂E
∂τ =

−ℏ2
2 ¯m∇2
⊥−i ¯γ
2 + ¯V (r⊥) + ¯g|E|2

E.
(32)
Eq. (32) is nearly equivalent to the Gross-Pitaevskii equa-
tion (30). A difference is that the electric field envelope
has not been renormalized to a particle density.
Con-
sequently, even though ¯g|E|2 in the NLSE has the same
dimension as g|ψ|2 in the GPE, the separate terms do
not have the same dimension.
Moreover, the gradient
operator is applied in two dimensions rather than three,
suggesting a correspondence with a 2D GPE. This high-
lights the need for a proper normalization of the “wave-
function” to either a 2D or 3D photon density, which
would, in turn, affect the effective nonlinear coefficient ¯g.
