Appendix A: Model with very redshifted and very
broad component
We report in Fig. A.1 the same plot presented in Fig. 2 but for a
model without the very broad and very redshifted component as-
sociated with the Hβ emission line (i.e., Model 2). The strongest
differences are observed at λ ≃5000. Model 2, without the in-
clusion of the additional Gaussian component, cannot reproduce
the flux excess observed a those wavelengths.
Fig. A.1. Best-fit result of Model 2 on the ESPRESSO data. The top
panel shows the data in gray smoothed with a Gaussian Kernel (σ ≃
0.07Å), the best-fit model (black line), and all the emission components
identified by different colors: Hγ in gold, Hβ in red, [OIII] in cyan, Fe
in light-blue and the continuum in dark blue. The vertical dashed lines
indicate, the rest-frame emission wavelength of the Hγ, Hβ, and [OIII].
The bottom panel represents the residuals defined as (data-model)/error,
the horizontal dashed black line at the zero level of residuals is plotted
to guide the eyes.
Appendix B: Emissivity distribution for the Hγ
emission line
We report in Fig. B.1 the projected emissivity for the Hγ emis-
sion line (left) and the Doppler shift (right) at each position of the
BLR. The Hγ emissivity starts to decline at smaller radii com-
pared to that of the Hβ as a consequence of the smaller σξc,Hγ that
results in a more compact configuration.
Fig. B.1. Projected Hγ emission and Doppler shift of the spiral BLR
best-fit. The top left panel is the projected BLR emissivity normalized to
the maximum emissivity for the Hγ, while the right top panel represents
the Doppler shift of each BLR element. The bottom panels show a zoom
of the emissivity (left) and Doppler shift (right) on the central region of
the BLR.
