These results reveal several significant patterns:
• Zero-shot effectiveness: OPAL without fine-tuning
(81.1% average ATP) achieves comparable overall
performance to fine-tuned π0 models (82.3% av-
erage ATP), demonstrating the effectiveness of our
topological constraints in capturing generalizable
physical principles.
• Task-dependent patterns: Performance analysis re-
veals three distinct categories:
– Contact-heavy tasks (Box Building, To-go
Box, Packing Eggs): Fine-tuned π0 outper-
forms OPAL by 5-15%, suggesting these tasks
benefit more from task-specific optimization.
– Environmental manipulation tasks (Bussing,
Grocery Bagging, Toast): OPAL outperforms
π0 by 5-8% despite lacking fine-tuning, indi-
cating the topological approach better captures
physical constraints in these domains.
– Fabric manipulation tasks (Laundry Folding,
Shirt Folding): Both models perform similarly,
with OPAL showing a slight edge on shirt fold-
ing (99% vs 97%).
• Performance variance: OPAL demonstrates more
consistent performance across diverse tasks (stan-
dard deviation σ = 14.8) compared to π0 (σ =
10.4), Octo (σ = 2.1), and OpenVLA (σ = 10.7).

OPAL’s two-phase inference procedure with Runge-Kutta
integration yields a 42% reduction in inference time com-
pared to π0 while maintaining comparable model quality.
This efficiency gain is particularly important for real-time
robotic control applications.

Ablation Studies
To isolate the contribution of each component in our ar-
chitecture, we conducted ablation studies across several
model variants. Table 3 presents performance on a subset
