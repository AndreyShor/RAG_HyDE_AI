The differences in mass predictions in the sum rules method [47] ([45]) are of 2% (0.4%) in the ground state and 2% (0.2%) in
the next calculated resonance (1P). The predicted results for the ground state by the sum rules in Ref. [48] show a difference of
about 0.4% compared to our ﬁndings. The mass of Ω
∗
bbb in its ground state shows a discrepancy of 5% compared to predicted
values in Refs. [25, 32]. In the 1S state, results obtained in Refs. [36, 45] exhibit a discrepancy of 2% and calculations performed
in Refs. [35, 39, 48, 63] show a discrepancy of 1% with our calculation. Our prediction in the 1S state aligns with previous
results in Ref. [47] within the uncertainty range. In the ﬁrst orbital excitation of Ω
∗
bbb, our predicted mass shows a discrepancy
of 5% compared to results obtained in Refs. [25, 32], 3% with predictions made in Refs. [35, 36, 39, 47] and 2% with calculated
masses in Refs[45, 63]. For the ﬁrst radial excited state of particle Ω
∗
bbb, our results show discrepancies of 5%, 4% and 3%,
respectively, when compared to existing results in Ref. [25], Ref. [39] and Refs. [35, 36, 63].
Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, we have calculated the residues of the 1S, 1P and 2S states, in light of the effect of
nonperturbative terms up to the eight mass dimension, and have presented them in Table III along with the error interval.
Conversely, only a limited number of studies on the residue quantities of triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2, which serve as
input for analyzing various related decay processes, can be found in the literature. Table V summarizes the available residue
predictions with the aim of comparing them. The residues of triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2 in the 1S and 1P states have
been computed using the QCD sum rule technique [45, 47]. In the 1S and 1P states, overall we see a signiﬁcant difference in
the values of the presented residues and existing studies (there are some consistencies between our results and the prediction of
residue in Ref. [45] for Ω

∗
ccb in the ﬁrst orbital excited state
and the prediction of residue in Ref. [47] for Ω

At the closing of this section, it is worth mentioning that our results can be used as input for investigating various decay
channels of triply heavy spin-3/2 baryons and may also facilitate the search for these unseen particles for experimental groups.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Based on the quark model, the singly, doubly, and triply hadronic states containing heavy quarks are predicted. In this work,
we investigated the ground and excited states of the triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2, considering positive and negative parity
(the investigation of these states with spin-1/2 was carried out in previous study [49]). The mass and residue are among the most
fundamental parameters characterizing a particle and play a key role in the analysis of its interaction mechanisms and decay
behaviors. To analyze these states, we employ the sum rules, which serve as a predictive and reliable nonperturbative approach.
To enhance the accuracy of mass and residue calculations for triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2 in the ground state (1S), the
ﬁrst orbital excitation (1P), and the ﬁrst radial excitation (2S), we have incorporated nonperturbative contributions up to mass
dimension eight. The masses and residues of the FTRs for the investigated particles have been determined by optimizing the
auxiliary parameters speciﬁc to each state, as presented in Table III. Moreover, in the absence of experimental data for the studied
particles, we have exclusively compared our obtained masses and residues with the available theoretical predictions, as shown in
Tables IV and V. Our results for the masses show slight differences from some of the channels within the presented uncertainty
range, with deviations ranging from 0.2 % to 5%. In contrast, for the residues, we observe more signiﬁcant discrepancies
between our results and previous predictions.
