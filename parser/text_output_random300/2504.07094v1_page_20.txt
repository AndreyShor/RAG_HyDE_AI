FIG. S2. Convergence of the iterative procedure.
Average relative error of the two-step iterative solution
of the self-consistent equations S1. (top) Starting from a
uniform initial profile, the density of states of first iter-

which converge efficiently. (bottom) The converged solu-
tion of the first step is then refined by iteratively evolv-

range. Starting from this value, the number of repli-
cas and their temperatures were iteratively refined
with preliminary runs to ensure that the probabil-
ity distributions of adjacent replicas intersected at
approximately half their peak heights.
For the production runs, the elementary moves
consisted of single spin flips applied to slack and non-
slack spins. The two types of spin flips were alter-
nated, i.e., after a non-slack spin flip, the next spin
flip was restricted only to slack variables. Ground
state configurations were picked from the uncor-
related states sampled at the lowest-temperature
replica.
The autocorrelation time was computed
from the decay of the time-lagged average overlap
of the spin configurations.

LINKING PROBABILITY OF MELTS
WITH SELECTED NUMBER OF RINGS
The non-monotonicity of the linking probability
presented in the main text is a robust feature in that
it does not depend on the fluctuating number of self-
assembled rings, nrings. To establish this, we com-
puted the linking probability for microstates that
involved 3, 4, and 5, only. The nrings selection was
applied a posteriori on the states collected at the
various sampled intervals.
The selection criterion
allows for limiting the fluctuations of the number
of rings without suppressing the number of selected
states.
The average linking probability for the equili-
brated ring melt ensemble subject to the nrings re-
striction is shown in Fig. S3. As can be seen, the
non-monotonicity is a robust feature because it is
also present when considering a small number of
rings.

AVERAGE CURVATURE VS BENDING
RIGIDITY
To complete the characterization of the canoni-
cal equilibrium properties of the ring melt, we used
the density of states reconstruction and reweight-
ing method to profile the average number of corner
turns, nc, versus the reduced bending rigidity, βκb.
The resulting profile tying the two conjugate vari-
ables is shown in Fig. S4.
