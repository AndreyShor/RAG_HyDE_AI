Proof. As before, let us choose bases (ξ1
i )i and (ξ2
j )j be projective bases localized in a negative
region F1 and a positive region F2. Let us take a B0-bimodule decomposition L
i∈I X−
i ⊗X+
i ≃
X from Corollary 4.14.
Now, consider the span Y = W
i ξ1
i B0. On the one hand, it is a B0-submodule of X, since
A−ξ1
i is contained in the span of ξ1
i′A−for 1 ≤i′ ≤n. On the other, it contains the vectors ξ2
i
by Corollary 5.10, hence we have the equality Y = W
j ξ2
j B0.
Let us take a subset J ⊂I satisfying Y = L
i∈J X−
i ⊗X+
i . On one hand, as the vectors ξ1
i
are A+-central, we have X+
i
≃A+ for i ∈J. On the other, as the vectors ξ2
j are A−-central,
we also have X−
i ≃A−for i ∈J.
This implies Y ≃Bk
0 as B0-bimodules, and we ﬁnd B0-central vectors.

Theorem 5.12. Suppose that A• satisﬁes charge-transporter generation (Condition 4.10) and
that it is locally aligned (Condition 5.6). Let X be in the M¨uger center of DHR(A•). Then X
is isomorphic to the trivial bimodule Ak.
Proof. By induction, it is enough to ﬁnd a copy of A as a direct summand of X as a A-bimodule.
Proposition 5.11 gives a nonzero B0-central vector ξ ∈X. It is enough to show that ξ is in fact
A-central.
Let us take a basis (ξi)i of X localized in an interval [−a, −1]. Then we claim that ξ is of the
form P
i ξiai, with ai ∈A[−a−R,R] where R is the controlling constant from weak algebraic Haag
duality (Condition 2.2). Indeed, the B0-centrality of ξ implies that ai = ⟨ξi|ξ⟩should commute
with A(−∞,−a] and A[0,∞). Then Condition 2.2 implies the claim.
Let us analyze the condition βY,X = β−1
X,Y when Y is another DHR-bimodule. We choose two
localized bases (η1
p)p and (η2
q)q of Y , respectively to the left of −a −R and to the right of R.
Let tpq = ⟨η1
p|η2
q⟩be the corresponding charge transporter, so that we have
η2
q =
X
p
η1
ptpq.
By deﬁnition of the braiding we have
βY,X(η1
p ⊗ξi) = ξi ⊗η1
p,
β−1
X,Y (η2
q ⊗ξi) = ξi ⊗η2
q,
and by the commutation of the coeﬃcients ai with η1
p and η2
q, we have the same formulas when
we replace ξi with ξ.
Then the equality βY,X = β−1
X,Y implies that we have
X
p
η1
p ⊗tpqξ =
X
p
η1
p ⊗ξtpq
for each q. We then obtain the claim by an argument analogous to the last part of the proof
for Proposition 5.4.

5.3. Essential surjectivity of comparison functor. Let us keep Conditions 4.10 and 5.6.
Having established that DHR(A•) is a nondegenerate full braided subcategory of Z(C), [M¨ug03b,
Theorem 4.2] gives an equivalence of braided categories
(5.1)
Z(C) ≃DHR(A•) ⊠Z′,
where Z′ is a modular tensor category (more speciﬁcally Z′ is the centralizer of the essential
image of DHR(A•) under ˜F in Z(C)).
Proposition 5.13. The tensor functor Z′ →C obtained by the restriction of the forgetful
functor Z(C) →C is fully faithful.
Proof. Since Z′ is a rigid tensor category, we only need to prove fullness. By Frobenius reci-
procity, we can reduce this to HomZ′(1, Y ) = HomC(1, Y ) for objects (Y, c) ∈Z′.
