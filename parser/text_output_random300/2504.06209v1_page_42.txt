For the environment under consideration and since agent models in A
→
←env
mea
actions are uniformly distributed,
this is easily computed and found to be ln[256/27]/ ln[16], which results in a work rate (in units of kBT ln 2) of
1 −ln[256/27]/ ln[16] for all agent models in A

←env
mea . Since this is smaller than the work capacity, eq. (G64), it follows
that A

mea ∩A

= ∅.
What is left to show is that A

mea ∩A

pred = ∅. Above, we showed that for all predictive agent models for the
environment under consideration, we have ⟨H (At|Mt)⟩t = 0 which contradicts the definition of agent models in A

which concludes the proof.
