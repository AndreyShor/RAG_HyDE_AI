Angular analysis of the decay
B0
s →ϕe+e−
LHCb collaboration†
Abstract
An angular analysis of the decay B0
s →ϕe+e−is presented, using proton-proton colli-
sion data collected with the LHCb detector between 2011 and 2018 at centre-of-mass
energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV. The combined dataset corresponds to an integrated lu-
minosity of 9 fb−1. Observables are determined by fitting time-integrated projections
of the angular distribution in three bins of dielectron mass squared, q2, correspond-
ing to [0.1, 1.1], [1.1, 6.0] and [15.0, 19.0] GeV2/c4. The results are compatible with
predictions based on the Standard Model of particle physics.
