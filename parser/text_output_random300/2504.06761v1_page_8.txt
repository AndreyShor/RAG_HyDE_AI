Table 1. Summary of computational parameters and cost for synthetic wall-attached turbulence in half
channel flow at various friction Reynolds numbers Re𝜏. The computational domain is fixed at 8𝜋× 1 × 3𝜋
in the streamwise (𝑥), wall-normal (𝑦), and spanwise (𝑧) directions, respectively. The table lists the number
of grid points in each direction (𝑁𝑥, 𝑁𝑦, 𝑁𝑧), the total number of self-similar vortices synthesized, and the
CPU hours required for constructing each flow field.
Figure 3 provides an overview of the construction process for SWAT, summarizing the
key steps involved. This process is based on the attached-eddy model, where the structural
properties of vortex packets are determined by input parameters such as the friction Reynolds
number and boundary layer thickness. These properties include the hierarchical distribution
of hairpin vortices, their population density, and spanwise meandering. The vorticity field
is then reconstructed using the centerlines, circulation strengths, and core size distributions.
Finally, the velocity field is computed using the Biot–Savart law, with corrections for wall
and bulk flow. In our approach, the only required input parameter for a given channel flow
within a specified computational domain is the friction Reynolds number Re𝜏. All other flow
characteristics, including the hierarchical vortex structures, their spatial distributions, and
the velocity field, are systematically derived from this single parameter.
Compared to DNS, the computational cost of the SWAT method is almost negligible.
Table 1 summarizes key metrics for all SWAT cases presented in this paper, covering friction
Reynolds numbers ranging from 1,000 to 10,000. These metrics include the number of
computational grid points, the number of vortices, and the CPU hours required for each
calculation. The smallest hairpin vortex height is resolved with at least five grid points
in the wall-normal direction, ensuring an accurate representation of coherent structures.
The computational expense of SWAT primarily depends on the number of grid points and
the total number of self-similar vortices, and thus increases with the specified Reynolds
number. Nevertheless, due to the method’s highly efficient numerical construction, the overall
consumption of computing resources remains minimal.
3. Statistics and structure of synthetic wall-attached turbulence
3.1. Mean velocity and Reynolds stresses
Taking turbulent channel flow as a representative case, we leverage DNS data (Lee & Moser
2015; Oberlack et al. 2022) to systematically assess the statistical properties and structural
characteristics of the constructed SWAT. We first generate a synthetic wall-bounded flow
within a computational domain of 𝐿𝑥× 𝐿𝑧= 8𝜋× 3𝜋, with a prescribed channel half-height
of 𝛿= 1, a Reynolds number of Re𝜏= 1000.
To visualize the generated turbulence, we employ the VSF of 𝜙𝑣= 0.1, as illustrated in
figure 4(a). The synthetic flow field, constructed using our numerical methods and carefully
designed vortex elements, exhibits structural features that closely resemble those observed
in both experimental measurements and high-fidelity DNS data. Notably, vortices spanning
a wide range of length scales remain attached to the wall, forming a complex multiscale
structure of a vortex forest. This hierarchical organization of vortices is a key characteristic
of wall turbulence, capturing essential dynamical features of real turbulent boundary layers.
