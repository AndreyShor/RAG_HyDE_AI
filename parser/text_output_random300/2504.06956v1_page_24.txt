Local structure of extremal points

Now, we consider the function ζ : R+
0 →R+
0 given by
ζ(s)
def= C[1 + log(C + s)]2 ,
where C is the constant appearing in the definition of Rk which, without any loss of generality, we can
assume to be large enough so that ζ is increasing and concave on R+
0 . Then on the event {Bk = z}
for some z ∈R, again by possibly enlarging the constant C in the definition of ζ, thanks to the Markov
property of the Brownian bridge, it holds that
P0,u,b
b−1

j=k
{Bj ≥−1 −Rk(j)}
 Gk

≤Pz,u,b−k

{Bj ≥−ζ(j)}

.
Now, thanks to Lemma A.10, we have that
Pz,u,b−k

s∈[0,b−k](Bs + 2ζ(k + s)) ≥0

,
(4.19)
where the implicit constant is independent of everything else. Since by definition one has Oscj(B) ≤
Θk(j) on the event Ek, for all j ∈[k]0, we can assume that
z ∈[−ζ(k), (k + 1)(log(k + 1))2] .
We let ak
def= ζ(k) ∨((k + 1)(log(k + 1))2). Since the probability on the right-hand side of (4.19) is
increasing in z ∈R, we can estimate this probability for z ∈[ak, 3ak]. It follows from Proposition A.5
that
sup
z∈[ak,3ak]


inf
s∈[0,b−k](Bs + 2ζ(k + s)) ≥0

(4.20)
We note that the presence of a2
k instead of ak in the above expression – as one might expect from
Proposition A.5 – is due to the first summand in the error term (A.9). Furthermore, we observe that a
direct application of Lemma A.7 shows that the remaining summands in the error term (A.9) can be
bounded uniformly over all k ∈[b −1] and z ∈[ak, 3ak].
Therefore, combining the previous considerations, so far we have proved that on the event Ek, it holds
that
P0,u,b
b−1
\
j=k
{Bj ≥−1 −Rk(j)}
 Gk

≲a2

b −k .
On the other hand, thanks to Cauchy–Schwartz’s inequality and arguing as in the proof of Lemma 4.8,
we have that P(Ek ∩Ak) ≤e−c1(log k)2p
P0,u,b(Ak), for some constant c1 > 0. Hence, by absorbing
the factors a2
k and b/(b −k) inside the exponential, we obtain that there exists a constant c2 > 0 such
that
P0,u,b

Kb = k,
b−1
\
j=k
{Bj ≥−1 −Rk(j)}, Ak

≲u
b e−c2(log k)2p
P0,u,b(Ak) ,
from which the conclusion follows. Finally, the proof of (4.18) can be done similarly and hence is
omitted.
In what follows, we also require the following version of Lemma 4.10, where the endpoint of the
Brownian bridge is constrained to be less than b1/4.
Lemma 4.11. Let A > 0 be fixed. There exists a constant c > 0 such that for λ > 0, for all b ∈N
sufficiently large, u ∈[−A, b1/4], k ∈[b −1], and any event Ak ∈Gk,
P0,u,b
