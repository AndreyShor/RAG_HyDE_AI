∂R
∂ξ = 0, having a repeated root at ξ = ξ0 for our special value of E. Here ∇R.∇S = 0
automatically from the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
We refer to this identity as DQLC, ”Durran Quantum Liouville Condition”.
2.2. Underlying Classical Mechanics of Euler’s Two Centre Problem
We have seen that the potential energy for two centres is
V = −1

.
A simple calculation yields the kinetic energy T as
T = 2−1( ˙X
2 + ˙Y
2) = c2
2 (cosh2ξ −cos2 η)( ˙ξ2 + ˙η2).
So the problem is of classical Liouville type. Here we give a brief account of Euler’s
solution following Whittaker, Ref. [25]. Starting with the Lagrange equation,
