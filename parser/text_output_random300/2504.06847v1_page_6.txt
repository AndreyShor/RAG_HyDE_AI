diffractometer (MoKα radiation, graphite monochromator). Data for 2-AmpHSO4 (I) and (2-
Amp)2SO4H2O were corrected for absorption by the methods incorporated in the 
diffractometer software (multi-scan routine [31]). The diffraction data for a selected single 
crystal of 2-AmpHSO4 (II) were collected on a Bruker D8 VENTURE Kappa Duo 
diffractometer (MoKα radiation, graphite monochromator) equipped with a PHOTON100 
detector. The full-set data (±h, ±k, ±l, 2θ ≤ 55◦) were reduced by the diffractometer software 
SAINT [32]. The diffractometer software (SADABS [33]), utilizing a multi-scan method, was 
used to correct the data for absorption. An Oxford Cryosystems liquid nitrogen Cryostream 
Cooler controlled the temperature of all studied crystals.  
The direct methods (SHELXS97 [34]) were used for solving the phase problem, and the 
structures were refined using a full-matrix least-squares routine based on F2 (SHELXL97 [34]). 
The non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. The hydrogen 
atoms bonded to carbon were included in their calculated positions and refined as riding atoms. 
The other hydrogen atoms were localized on the difference electron density maps and were 
fixed during refinement using a rigid body approximation with the assigned displacement 
parameters equal to 1.2 Uiso (pivot atom). The recent PLATON software [30] was used for the 
geometric analysis and creation of crystallographic figures. Presented graph-set descriptors 
were generated by MERCURY software [35].  
Tables 1(a) and 1(b) summarize the basic crystallographic data, measurement and refinement 
details. The crystallographic data of 2-AmpH2PO3, 2-AmpHSO4 (I), 2-AmpHSO4 (II) and (2-
Amp)2SO4H2O have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as 
supplementary publications CCDC 1503404, CCDC 1586910, CCDC 2320713 and CCDC 
1586911, respectively. The selected geometric parameters (bond lengths, angles and hydrogen 
bonds) are listed in Tables S6-S9, Supplementary material. 
The crystallographic data of 2-AmpCl½H2O (i.e. reference compound for the vibrational 
spectroscopic study) have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as 
supplementary publication CCDC 2427845. Tables S10, S11 and Fig. S1 (Supplementary 
material) summarize basic crystallographic data, measurement and refinement details, selected 
geometric parameters, and atom numbering, respectively.
