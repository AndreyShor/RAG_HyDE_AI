1.3 No-scale models from higher dimensions

63, 64]. In the following, for illustration, we briefly summarize the N = 1
options that arise when compactifying the heterotic, Type IIA and Type IIB
superstring theories on the orbifold T 6/(Z2 ×Z2), with an additional Z2 ori-
entifold projection in the case of the N = 8 Type II theories. For simplicity,
we ignore matter fields and concentrate on the chiral superfields containing
the seven main moduli (zk)k=1,...,7 = (S, T1, T2, T3, U1, U2, U3), where S is
usually called dilaton, TA Kähler moduli and UA complex structure mod-
uli (A = 1, 2, 3). Their real parts come from the dilaton and the diagonal
components of the internal metric, their imaginary parts come from internal
components of the p-forms and from the off-diagonal components of the in-
ternal metric. Although their identification in terms of the d = 10 bulk fields
is model-dependent, they are described by a common Kähler potential with
well-defined scaling properties

We then expect, on the basis of the general discussion in section 1.2.2, that
no-scale models can be generated if W has a non-trivial dependence on four
moduli (zbk) and does not depend on three of them (zα). The origin of W
resides, at the perturbative level, in the possible geometrical fluxes that can
be turned on in the different models: these fluxes include the (p+1)-form field
strengths of the p-forms present in the model, as well as metric fluxes (we
neglect here non-geometrical fluxes, which can be introduced by exploiting
the correspondence between fluxes and the gauging of the duality symmetries
of extended supergravities). Indeed, it can be shown that the most general
N = 1 superpotential generated by fluxes is a polynomial of the form
W = a + i ak zk + akl zkzl + i aklm zkzlzm + . . . ,

where the real coefficients (a, ak, akl, aklm, . . .) (k < l < m < . . . = 1, . . . , 7)
are constrained by the possible fluxes that are compatible with the bosonic
field content of the model, with the orbifold and orientifold projections and
with the Bianchi identities (BI) of local symmetries gauged by either bulk
or brane-localized vectors. In the heterotic case, the available fluxes are 24
metric fluxes ω3 and 8 fluxes H3 of the NS-NS 3-form, subject to quadratic
constraints of the generic form ω3 · ω3 = 0 and ω3 · H3 = 0: the former
induce in W terms containing 1 TA and 0/1/2/3 UA, the latter induce terms
with no S, no TA and 0/1/2/3 UA. In this case, there are only bulk vector
fields and the BI are equivalent to the Jacobi identities of N = 4 gauged
supergravity [42]. A simple example of no-scale model generated by metric
