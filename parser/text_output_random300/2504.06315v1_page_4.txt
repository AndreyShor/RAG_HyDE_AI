been adjusted to 6.93 · 10−2 [mmHg · s · ml−1], capturing the additional resistance introduced by the retinal blood flow
dynamics.
Importantly, all other aspects of the cardiovascular system remain unchanged from the original model proposed
by Avanzolini et al. [2]. These modifications focus solely on integrating the eye-specific circulation while preserving
the original framework for the rest of the cardiovascular system. As such, the adopted strategy ensures consistency
with the validated physiological dynamics described in the original model.
Ocular System
A detailed description of the retinal circulation model and mathematical equations can be found in Guidoboni et al.
[10, 11]. This section provides a brief overview of the main features of the model. In this framework, the vasculature is
divided into five main compartments labeled accordingly: the central retinal artery (CRA), arterioles (art), capillaries
(cap), venules (ven), and the central retinal vein (CRV). Alphanumerical labels further distinguish between specific
segments within each compartment. The blood flow within the retina is driven by a pressure difference between the
inlet, Pcra,in, which is the blood pressure upstream of the CRA, and the outlet, Pcrv,out, the pressure downstream of the
CRV. External pressures affect different parts of the retinal network: intraocular segments are exposed to intraocular
pressure (IOP), while retrobulbar segments behind the eye experience retrolaminar tissue pressure (RLTp). This
combination of resistances and pressures provides a comprehensive blood flow model through the retinal vasculature.
The eye-heart model retains the retinal circulation framework established in the foundational work by Guidoboni
et al. [10], ensuring consistency with physiological values derived from experimental data. The original description
of retinal circulation and its parameters, including vascular resistance, compliance, and blood flow dynamics, remain
unchanged. In this manner, the model predictions remain consistent with validated physiological observations of
retinal hemodynamics.
Moreover, building upon the base model of the retinal circulation, we further introduce an additional parallel
circuit, referred to as the eye branch, which represents the blood flow directed toward non-retinal structures. Although
the term "eye branch" can be seen a simplification, it is intended to encompass all ocular vascular beds outside
the retina, such as the choroid and ciliary body. This extension enables the model to capture the broader ocular
circulation, accounting for the distinct hemodynamic properties and functional roles of these non-retinal structures.
By incorporating the eye branch, the model provides a more comprehensive representation of blood flow within the
eye and accounts for flow redistribution mechanisms under conditions of elevated external pressure.
Eye-Heart Coupling
The original eye-heart coupling component of the physiological model is designed to capture the dynamics of blood
circulation between the heart and a single eye. This focused approach simplifies the systemic circulatory model by
isolating the blood flow directed to the eye while incorporating the rest of the blood flow, including that towards the
brain and other systemic tissues, into a separate branch of the body circulation. This separation enables a targeted
analysis of ocular hemodynamics without compromising the systemic integrity of the model.
The direct connection between the heart and the eye is described using an aorta-to-eye and eye-to-vena cava
equivalent circuit, represented by resistive, capacitive, and inductive elements. These elements collectively simulate
the vascular resistance, compliance, and volumetric blood flow within the pathway from the aorta to the ocular circu-
lation and back to the venous system. By calibrating the R, C, and L parameters, the model captures the distinctive
hemodynamic properties of the eye, including its dependence on systemic blood pressure and flow rates originating
from the heart.
This simplification enhances computational efficiency and allows detailed exploration of the interplay of cardio-
vascular and ocular systems. It provides a robust framework for investigating eye-specific circulatory phenomena,
such as retinal blood flow regulation and pressure-induced vascular changes.
Model equations
The overall description results in the following set of ODEs, which models the coupling between the eye and heart
dynamics. These equations describe the hemodynamics between various compartments, including the aorta, body,
lungs, and the eye. The system of equations accounts for pressure and flow rates in the cardiovascular and ocular
systems, considering factors such as resistance, compliance, and inductance in each compartment. We gather below
the equations governing the overall dynamics of the coupled system:
