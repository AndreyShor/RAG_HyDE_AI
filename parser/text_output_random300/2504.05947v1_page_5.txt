Figure 3: (a) A diffraction pattern of a single scan point of a martensitic steel sample. (b) Diffraction
pattern summed over all 14091 scan points. (c) Transformation to polar coordinates of the summed
diffraction pattern via caking. (d) Resulting 1D integration with the 2Î¸ positions of martensite and
austenite indicated.
