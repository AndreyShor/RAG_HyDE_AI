where ˆOq represents the spatial operator. Its correspond-
ing specific forms are as follows: 1/q2, 1/q4, and exp[−q2]
represent the Coulomb, linear confinement, and hyperfine
potential, respectively. The ⃗k1 (⃗k2) is the initial (final)
three-momenta of the scattered constituent. We use the
⃗PB, ⃗PC, ⃗Pα, and ⃗Pβ to present the three-momenta of final
singly-charmed baryons B, C and initial doubly-charmed
hexaquark (cc) and ([qq][qq]) components, respectively.
For simplicity, we deal with the scattering problem in the
center-of-mass frame, so that ⃗PB = −⃗PC and ⃗Pα = −⃗Pβ.
By applying the above relationships, for the four quark
exchange diagrams in Fig. 2, the relationships of ⃗ki and
⃗Ki (i = B, C, α, β) expressed in terms of ⃗PB, ⃗Pα, ⃗k1, and
⃗k2 are shown in Table III. Here, the constituent quark
mass-dependent function fi (i = α, β1, β2, B, C) is:

The specific derivation of integral simplification for Eq.

are computed using Eq. (14) and presented in Tables IV-

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND
DISCUSSIONS
By solving the Schr¨odinger equation Eq. (12) with
the Gaussian expansion method, we systematically cal-
culated the mass spectra of the doubly-charmed hex-
aquark system. The mass range of the doubly-charmed
hexaquark system approximately spans 5000–6000 MeV.
The mass spectra and relevant configurations are listed
in Tables IV-VI. The internal contributions from each
part of the Hamiltonian:
kinetic energy ⟨T⟩, confine-
ment potential ⟨V Con⟩, and hyperfine interaction poten-
tial ⟨V SS⟩, are also presented in the same tables. The
results show that the kinetic energy ⟨T⟩and confine-
ment potential ⟨V Con⟩are of the same order of mag-
nitude. Additionally, it is found that the contribution
of hyperfine interaction potential ⟨V SS⟩—proportional
to (1/mimj)—significantly suppresses its mass contribu-
tion. Owing to its smaller mass contribution, the degree
of configuration mixing remains relatively low. As a re-
sult, configuration mixing does not induce obvious mass
shifts in physical states. Thus, each original configura-
tion maintains high purity in its corresponding physical
state. Meanwhile, the mass gaps between different color-
spin configurations of the same color configuration (|¯33⟩c
or |6¯6⟩c) are relatively small, leading to the existence of
some partner states in the doubly-charmed hexaquark
system.
Besides the mass spectra and internal mass contribu-
tions, we provide the corresponding RMS radii accord-
ing to Eq. (13). Based on the results from relevant ta-
bles, most of RMS radii are in the range from 1.2 to
1.6 fm, which are roughly the same order of magnitude.
If it is a molecular-state configuration, some distances
between charm quark (c) and diquark ([qq]) are much
greater than those between the two charm quarks (cc)
and between the two diquarks ([qq] −[qq]). Meanwhile,
the RMS radius of the molecular configuration can reach
several femtometers. Therefore, our calculation results
are consistent with the expectations of the compact hex-
aquark configuration.
Finally, based on Eq.
(14), we
presented the partial widths of each state decaying into
different two-body final states, as well as its total width.
It should be noted that the total decay width here ig-
nores the suppressed three-body strong decays, the two-
body strong decays with the final states: doubly-charmed
baryon+light-flavor baryon (ccq +qqq), as well as the ra-
diative decays and weak decays. Therefore, the actual
total widths of these states will be slightly larger than
our calculated values.
For clarity, according to Tables IV-VI, the relative
mass positions of each state, the total decay widths,
and the corresponding rearrangement decay channels
are plotted in Figs. 3-5. For convenience, we also label
all possible spin (isospin) quantum numbers of the rear-
rangement decay channels with subscripts (superscripts).
According to the above-mentioned figures, there is no
stable state in the doubly-charmed hexaquark system,
and they are all unstable states which can decay into
two singly-charmed baryons through two-body strong
interaction. The reason is that the pairwise attractive
interaction provided by ⟨V Con⟩is far smaller than that
of the two singly-charmed baryons in the decay final
states.
Therefore, their masses are higher than the
threshold of the decay final states. For simplicity, we use
the notation Hcontent(Mass, I, JP ) to label a particular
doubly-charmed hexaquark state.
A.
The cc[nn][nn] and cc[ss][ss] subsystems
In the following, we first discuss the cc[nn][nn] and
cc[ss][ss] subsystems. For the cc[nn][nn] subsystem, the
isospin of two [nn] diquarks can couple to I = 2, 1, and
0. According to the Spin-Statistics Theorem, the I = 2
states and the I = 0 states have the same symmetry
constraints for total wave functions, leading to their de-
generacy in mass spectra, RMS radii, and decay prop-
erties. A similar situation also occurs in doubly-heavy
pentaquark system. For the ccnn¯n and bbnn¯n subsys-
tems with Inn = 1, the same spectra are obtained for the
case of the total isospin I = 1/2 and 3/2 [75]. This arises
because both the confinement potential and hyperfine in-
teraction in the Hamiltonian are independent of isospin.
Of course,
there is also a special configuration:
