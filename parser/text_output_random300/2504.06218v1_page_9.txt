Appendix: Dressed states model
1.
Dressed single Rydberg atom
a.
Basis states
Considering a microwave field whose frequency is
close to the transition-frequency between atomic lev-
els 55D and 54F (∼14 GHz), the basis states consid-
ered for dressed individual Rydberg atoms are the quasi-
degenerate set of direct products of normalized atomic
states and single-mode microwave field states [33]:
B(1)(N) = {|55Dα⟩|N⟩, |54Fα′⟩|N −1⟩}
where α(α′) designates additional atomic quantum num-
bers. N is the photon number of the dressing microwave
field of frequency ω. Assuming that the MW field is in an
intense single mode coherent state (∆ˆn = ⟨ˆn⟩1/2 ≪⟨ˆn⟩),
we use N = ⟨ˆn⟩, ˆn being the photon number operator
[33].
We signal that atomic states whose energy differences
with the 55D states are comparable to integer multiples
of ℏω are not included in the basis although such states
may exist in the close-packed state-density characteristic
of Rydberg atoms.
In the following, we will frequently use a simplified
notation for the basis states in which the principal
quantum number, the additional atomic state numbers
α and the microwave photon number will be implicit.

Hamiltonian
In the Hilbert space sustained by B(1)(N) and in the
rotating frame evolving at frequency Nω the dressed
atom Hamiltonian is:
H(1) = H(1)
0
+ H(1)
MW
Where,
H(1)
0
= ℏ(ωF D −ω)

|Fα⟩⟨Fα|
(A.1)
ℏωF D ≡ℏ(ωF −ωD) is the energy difference between
states 54F and 55D. The energy of the uncoupled
dressed states |D, N⟩is taken as zero.
The uncou-
pled energies group into two branches, one of them
with zero energy and the other linearly dependent on
ω with slope -1. The two branches intercept at ω = ωF D.
The coupling with the microwave field is described by:
H(1)
MW = ℏΩMWˆz
(A.2)
here ΩMW ≡µξN 1/2/ℏis the microwave Rabi frequency
(µ = ⟨55D||D||54F⟩is the electric dipole reduced matrix
element for the transition, ξ is the single-photon electric
field amplitude for the MW mode). ˆz is a dimensionless
vector operator aligned with the microwave linear polar-
ization which is chosen as the quantization axis (ˆz ≡T (1)
0
where T (1) is a spherical tensor operator).
H(1)
MW is responsible for the avoided crossing of the
two energies branches and the mixing by the microwave
of |D⟩and |F⟩states.
c.
Optical excitation
The optical fields are responsible for the excitation
of states within the basis set B(1)(N) from the dressed
ground states {|5S1/2, N⟩} set. The MW field-state N is
not affected by the optical interaction.
Guided by the experimental conditions, we assume
that all optical fields involved in Rydberg levels excita-
tions are linearly polarized along the quantization axis z.
This assumption imply the conservation of the quantum
number mJ (total angular momentum component along
the quantization axis).
We effectively describe the optical excitation as equiva-
lent to the irradiation of the atoms with a monochromatic
optical wave of frequency ω′ and Rabi frequency ΩOpt.
In the rotating-wave approximation, the corresponding
interaction is described by:
V (1)
Opt = ℏΩOpt(|55Dα0⟩⟨g| e−iω′t
+ |g⟩⟨55Dα0| eiω′t) ⊗1N
(A.3)
with
|g⟩
designating
the
atomic
ground
state
(5S1/2, mJ
=
1/2) and α0 representing the quan-
tum numbers {J = 3/2, mJ = 1/2}.
1N is the unit
operator for MW field states.
Only one magnetic quantum number, mJ = 1/2, was
included in (A.3). The contribution of atoms in the mJ =
−1/2 states can be considered independently in a similar
way.
2.
Dressed Rydberg atom-pairs
a.
Basis states
We consider a pair of Rydberg atoms labeled 1 and 2.
The basis states set for dressed Rydberg pairs are the
products of single-atoms and single-mode field states:
