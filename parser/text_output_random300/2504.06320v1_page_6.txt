the input features. In Fig. 5a, the time series of a tank
feature (T2) is overlaid with latent node 1, revealing a strong
correlation. The negative sign of the correlation arises from
the tanh activation function’s symmetry and random weight
initialization but still encodes the temporal dynamics. During
the attack phase (T2 overflow), this relationship breaks down,
and the tank feature exhibits variability far beyond normal
operational ranges, highlighting the anomaly.
In Fig. 5b, a flow value at a junction (J298) is compared to
its corresponding latent node. While the correlation remains
strong, the latent representation incorporates contributions
from other features, reflecting the system’s interconnected
nature. As with T2, the attack phase disrupts this correlation,
underscoring the latent representation’s sensitivity to anoma-
lies.
Finally, Fig. 5c shows latent node 6, a statistical node
capturing non-deterministic features like pump activations.
The alignment validate our hypothesis that statistical nodes
encode abrupt, discrete behaviors.
These results suggest that the model starts to distinguish
and meaningfully represent both deterministic and statistical
features, indicating a potential step towards more interpretable
latent representations for anomaly detection in complex sys-
tems.
B. Detection Performance
To assess the overall performance impact of our training
approach, Tab. III compares the classification performance
metrics against state-of-the-art references. Our model achieves
a performance of 0.9555, closely matching the AE-based
benchmark of 0.9587 [23]. The leading approach in the
BATADAL challenge [27] performs slightly better but relies
on intricate physical modeling of the water distribution pro-
cess. While effective, this method requires substantial domain
expertise, making it less practical for real-world applications.
In a previous study [21], it was shown that an edge-based
approach could improve the mean time to detect anomalies.
With the introduction of the proposed algorithm, we fur-
ther enhance this detection time by an additional 3%. This
outperform the current benchmarks [21], [28]. Notably, our
model reduces the number of fully connected layers from three
to two, which not only simplifies the architecture but also
decreases computational requirements. This reduction aligns
with our broader goal of developing greener intrusion detection
systems and contribute to the overarching societal goals of
sustainability. Despite its simplicity and minimal reliance on
domain-specific knowledge, our model slightly outperforms
the challenge leader, offering a more generalizable and ac-
cessible solution for anomaly detection in water distribution
systems.
VI. DISCUSSION & OUTLOOK
In this paper, we introduced hTDC-AE, a novel approach
to structuring the latent space of an autoencoder for anomaly
detection by incorporating a temporal differential consistency
(TDC) loss term during training. Our approach demonstrates

latent nodes across 500 examples from the BATADAL test dataset, including
one attack phase (highlighted in grey). The input features were scaled, and
the offset was adjusted to facilitate the comparison.
stable and reproducible results across multiple training runs.
By organizing the latent space into deterministic and statistical
nodes, the model shows the potential to bridge the gap between
data-driven methods and the integration of physics-inspired
principles. Deterministic nodes show indications of encoding
features related to physical processes, while statistical nodes
capture non-deterministic, abrupt changes such as pump acti-
vations. Furthermore, our results suggest that a TDC-based
approach enhances the model’s ability to detect not only
gradual deviations but also more sudden anomalies, such as
tank overflows or abrupt pressure drops, making it applicable
to a wider range of real-world scenarios.
Dynamic nodes exhibit strong temporal correlations, ap-
proximating the causal link between system states and their
derivatives. We attribute the enhanced detection capability
to the breakdown of this approximated causal link, which
translates into a faster increase in reconstruction error, enabling
quicker and more reliable anomaly identification.
Our approach matches the classification performance of
state-of-the-art models while significantly improving the time
to detect anomalies, a key performance metric in real-world
cyber-physical systems, by 3%. This improvement is critical
