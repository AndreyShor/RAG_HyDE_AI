Extended Data Fig. 3 | Determination of twist angle for non-aligned R5G/BN samples. a,
Optical image of sample S2. b,c, AFM images measured on R5G and BN regions on sample S2,
with red and black lines indicating the armchair (AC) direction. The twist angle is determined to
be 36◦± 1◦from BN to R5G (d). e, Optical image of sample S3. f,g, Intensity maps measured at
energies of -0.3 eV and -2.8 eV on sample S3, with K points of R5G and BN indicated by red and
black dotted circles. The twist angle is determined to be 42◦± 2◦from BN to R5G (h).
