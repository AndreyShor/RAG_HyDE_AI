noise from measurement devices. The presence of noise can obscure critical flow structures
and increase the complexity of prediction models. A total of 4000 snapshots are available,
of which the last 1000 have been utilized for training and validation purposes using the
80-20 split.
Given the presence of noise in the experimental data set, the ground truth data have
been cleaned and reconstructed to enhance their fidelity and have only been used for
the comparison of the results. The training of both the HOSVD and SVD-based models
has been performed using the noisy dataset.
Figure 23 illustrates the original noisy
velocity components of the experimental wake flow at t = 3828 and the cleaned and
reconstructed components using SVD. Since only 5 modes have been used, it is only
possible to predict the evolution of the coherent flow structures. The cleaning process
