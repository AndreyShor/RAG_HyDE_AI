time measured by a clock along its world-tube in the
presence of the stochastic noise? If the clock occupies
a volume V in space, the ﬂuctuations will be given by
averaging over the volume of the clock the local expres-
sion provided in Eq. (6). The spatial average of the time
correlation function writes as ⟨δt2⟩V = τt, where τ sets
the strength of the ﬂuctuation. This quantity has the
dimension of time and is deﬁned in terms of the smeared
correlation function as

The explicit expression of the smeared correlation func-
tion D for CSL and DP models is obtained from the
relation D(x) = (gσ ∗D ∗gσ)(x), using Eqs. (4) and
(5), respectively. In the case of CSL, the calculation is
straightforward and yields

where x = |x|. For DP, it is convenient to perform the
calculation in Fourier space, where the convolution is eas-
ier to compute. One immediately gets the Fourier trans-
form

Then, the evaluation of τ can be carried out analyt-
ically by choosing, for instance, a spherical shape for
the clock.
The exact results are shown in Fig.
1 for
a speciﬁc range of the clock radius R and a choice of pa-
rameters corresponding to the standard reference values.
For both CSL and DP, the ﬂuctuation in time measure-
ment is maximal for clock sizes comparable to or smaller
than the smearing length σ. In contrast, larger clocks
become less sensitive to the uncertainty of spacetime as
R increases, leading to more precise measurements of the
mean time. This is because the clock measures the mean
time within the section V of its world-tube. The optimal
spatial resolution corresponds to the smallest size of V,
when time-keeping has the worst precision. Conversely,
as V increases, time-keeping precision improves at the
expense of spatial resolution. The asymptotic behavior
of the ﬂuctuation strength is as follows

In conclusion, the relativistic relation (6) combined
with the presence of a stochastic component in the grav-
itational ﬁeld implies an unavoidable uncertainty in any
time measurement. Regardless of how small τ may be,
if it is nonzero, this uncertainty inevitably increases over
time. Therefore, it is essential to consider whether this
uncertainty could lead to measurable eﬀects, potentially
imposing a fundamental limit on clock precision.
After a period of time t, the random component of
the gravitational ﬁeld induces a ﬂuctuation in the mea-
sured time given by ∆t :=
p
⟨δt2⟩V =
√
τt. We focus
on optimal clocks with respect to spatial resolution, de-
ﬁned as those with dimensions comparable to the smear-
ing length, for which the ﬂuctuation strength reaches its
maximum value τ max (Eqs. (12) and (13)). To provide
insight into the relevant orders of magnitude, we set the
collapse parameters to their reference values and ﬁnd, at
t = 1 year, the values

The DP case (blue) is plotted on the left axis, and the

The
smearing length and the collapse rate parameters are set
to the standard values λ = 10−16 s−1, σCSL = 10−7 m
