TABLE I: Extension of Reck’s and Clements’ schemes for n-photon m-mode Boson sampling and comparison
with our own proposal. For Reck and Clements’ circuits, the black boxes are the MZIs that are removed by eye
from the original scheme as they never encounter a photon.
• Adding another label: If we want to sort a third
label, we need to add a superdiagonal layer of
conditional swaps like in Fig 6c.
Starting from
a circuit sorting k labels, adding a superdiagonal
layer lets us sort one label among the first n −k
ones. Necessarily, one of them belongs to the first
k + 1 labels. We move it to the first wire with our
newly added layer of conditional swaps. Then the
remaining circuit is a sorting network for k labels,
it will sort the remaining unsorted k first labels.
During this process, the originally k + 1-th sorted
label cannot be moved outside the first k+1 wires.
Overall we have sorted the first k + 1 labels.
To sort n labels, we need
m −1 + m −2 + . . . + m −n = mn −n(n + 1)

MZIs, which is optimal. The depth of the circuit is m,
which is one unit more than the lower bound. Provided
that n << m, which is the case in boson sampling ex-
periments, this new scheme provides a substantial re-
duction in the number of linear optical components,
from O(m2) to O(mn), at the expense of potentially
inducing unbalanced loss across the modes.
B.
Coupling multiple interferometers
Whilst integrated photonics allows for large numbers
of components on-chip, this is not unbounded. There
is an upper limit on the size of interferometer manufac-
turable, which depends on the modal confinement, the
length of the phase-shifters, and the size of the chip.
To reach the size of interferometers required for tasks
like boson sampling, one can consider the networking of
many smaller integrated interferometers. This affords
us layers of arbitrary but fixed connectivity, as the fi-
bres connections can in-principle couple any mode to
any other. This comes at the cost of needing to couple
between chips, which induces loss. The fibre links will
also be susceptible to phase instability.
Combining several smaller chips to the design of a
larger chips is not new and relative works can be found
in [25, 27]. Some limitations of these works are that
they either rely on special linear optical components
that may not be easy to implement in practice, or
