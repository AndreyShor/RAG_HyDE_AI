ing the pulse measurement system on the bench. Rather
than utilize a fiber-coupled APD, which has a bandwidth
and performance defined by refractive optics, we opted
for a free-space APD with an SMA fiber adapter to allow
the fiber to shine freely on the APD. As a result, we don’t
expect the coupling to be highly efficient, but the APD
output with our nominal fiber setup was found to drive
the APD halfway to saturation as it was. We therefore
did not perform any additional efficiency enhancements
prior to the testing described here, and left the APD set
to its maximum gain setting.
The results of this testing are summarized in the main
text, with power throughput summarized for comparison
to the power meter in Table III. Our best throughput
in warm (300 K) testing of the MEMS setup, with the
spot aligned at the maximum responsitivity point, was a
power of about 100 nW. This is only about 20 nW lower
than the loopback test using the 10µm fiber in a 4 K
test, suggesting that additional losses in the warm APD
setup are small, and coupling efficiency into the output
fiber is fairly high. An excess loss of 16 dB was measured
compared to an expected loss of 2 dB or less, which we
now attribute to substantially higher than expected loss
in the 105 µm Thorlabs output fiber.
Appendix B: Expected Optical Performance
This paper describes the cryogenic performance of a
new optical scanning and chopping unit that uses a
broad-band optical focusing apparatus in place of the
refractive focuser used previously Ref [14]. The new de-
sign, with its separate focusing and collimation optics,
offers flexibility to define the scan range, spot size, and
chopping-pulse timing during scanner construction. Be-
low, we show in detail how specific component choices
affect these three MEMS-scanner metrics.
1.
Spot Size
First, consider the case where a perfectly collimated
monochromatic source is focused to a diffraction-limited
spot at its focal length, a distance f0 from the focusing
optic. After traveling a distance l, the beam is incident on
a movable MEMS mirror, which can cover its full angular
deflection in some time t, sweeping the beam across a
focal plane at distance f0 −l from the MEMS mirror.
This setup is pictured in Figure 1 in the main text.
Consider a simple model for the beam waist size when
diffraction-limited at the focal spot. The diameter do of
the beam, assuming perfect collimation, is given by:
d0 = 2fc · NA
(B1)
where NA ∼n sin θ is the fiber’s numerical aperture, n
index of refraction, and fc is the focal length of the re-
flective collimator mirror. For a diffraction limited spot,
the size of the central diffraction peak can be defined as:
ddiff = (1.22)λf0
d0
= f0
fc
1.22λ
2NA
(B2)
In practice, the divergence of the collimated beam lim-
its longer focal length optics, and we need to include the
impact of beam divergence on the spot size. For the fiber-
based reflective collimators we use, the divergence angle
of the beam is given as:
θc = df
fc
(B3)
where df is the core diameter of the input optical fiber.
To calculate the spot diameter at the focal length of the
focuser from a beam with a known divergence angle,
ddiv = θcf0 = df
f0
fc
(B4)
For gaussian beams, we expect the divergence and diffrac-
tive effects to add in quadrature, so we have the effective
spot size at the focus of
deff = f0
fc
q
d2
f + (1.22λ/2NA)2
(B5)
= f0
d0
q
(2NA · df)2 + (1.22λ)2.
(B6)
In the limit that the fiber is much larger than the diffrac-
tion limited spot, this is just a magnifier, where an image
of the fiber is projected at the focal point of the focusing
optic, scaled by the magnification ratio M = f0/fc.
2.
Scan Range
For scanning applications, we care about both the spot
size and scan range. The beam waist varies with distance
from the main focusing mirror as d = d0 l
f0 where d0 is
the initial size of the collimated beam. For a mirror with
reflector of size dr, the maximum distance from the focal
spot is:
la = (f0 −l)max = dr
d0
f0 =
dr
2NA

fc
(B7)
All mirrors considered here have small angular deflec-
tions, and we can thus approximate the scan range dis-
tance as:
dscan ≈2θdla = drθd
NA
f0
fc
(B8)
where θd is the angle the beam is reflected. The beam
angle is doubled for a given angular displacement of the
mirror θm, so we find θd = 2θm, and:
dscan ≈2drθm
NA
f0
fc
