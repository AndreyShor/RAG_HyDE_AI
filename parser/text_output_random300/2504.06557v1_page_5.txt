capitalism. Monetary exchange in capitalist markets cuts off social relationships, but 
baseline communism connects them. The evils of capitalism lie in its emphasis on 
individualism and economic values, and there is a need to shift towards community, 
social, and moral values. Although (iv) a concession economy is ideal, whether an 
actual economy can be established without assuming exchange or reciprocity is a 
question that needs to be addressed. 
 Deguchi proposed the We-turn philosophy as a shift in values [17]. The We-
turn is an argument that the “I” as an individual is unable to perform physical actions 
alone because it has a “fundamental incapability” and that the subject of physical action, 
responsibility, and freedom is turned to “We” as a multi-agent system, including the “I.” 
Owing to our “fundamental incapability,” “We” are supported by various people and 
nature, even without being conscious of reciprocity or return. Under the We-turn, each 
individual will recognize each other’s “fundamental incapability” and diverse values, 
form a community of shared destiny as co-adventurers, including humans, nature, and 
the future, and sublimate society into solidarity. In a We-turn society, if physical actions 
are considered labor, collective action becomes solidarity and cooperation. The We-
turn philosophy is connected to Karatani and Graeber’s (iv) concession economy. 
 Based on the above, this study aims to clarify the differences in the 
properties of the four economic modes of (i) the gift economy, (ii) the power economy, 
(iii) the market economy, and (iv) the concession economy to answer questions about 
the feasibility of (iv) the concession economy and to provide guidelines for 
transformation towards that end. The problems of capitalism stem from the enclosure 
of commons, and the breakdown of communities, and their solution requires the 
regeneration of communities, baseline communism, and social relationships of “We.”
