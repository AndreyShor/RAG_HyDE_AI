behavior similar to that of 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸, as shown in Figure 3c and Figure S10. Upon electron 
doping MoSe2, both rise timescales of AM and nET increase up to about 6 ps; as electron 
doping further increases, both timescales decrease to about 1 ps. The rise dynamics of 
AM  resonance reflects the electronic thermalization in MoSe2, during which hot 
excitons interact with the Fermi sea and thus hot electrons are generated. Since the 
dynamics of nET is the temporal convolution of the electronic thermalization and the 
hot-electron tunneling, the similarity of the rise timescales evidences that, the rise 
dynamics of nET can be mainly attributed to the electronic thermalization, and the hot-
electron tunneling itself should be much faster (<1 ps that corresponds to the shortest 
rise timescale of nET dynamics at 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷=6.45 V). Similar fast hot-electron tunneling has 
been observed in WS2/graphene heterostructures10,28. Hence, we propose a doping-
assisted mechanism illustrated in Figure 3e,f: Through the scatterings between excitons 
and electrons in MoSe2, the excess energy of hot excitons is converted to the excitations 
of the Fermi sea, which generate hot electrons with enough kinetic energy that can 
transfer to the higher-energy conduction band of WS2; higher electron doping leads to 
more frequent scatterings (i.e., faster electronic thermalization), which generate more 
hot electrons and lead to faster rise dynamics of 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸. Once the electronic quasi-
equilibrium is achieved with the formation of Fermi polaron, no more hot electrons get 
generated and the hot-electron extraction terminates. For neutral MoSe2 (Figure 3d), 
the scatterings among excitons can also generate hot electrons that can transfer to WS2,
