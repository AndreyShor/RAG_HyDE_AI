figure 2, consisting of two ferromagnetic layers separated by an oxide layer [24]. One layer has fixed magnetic 
orientation, referred to as the reference layer. The other layer’s orientation can be switched. If the reference layer and 
free layer have magnetic orientation in the same direction, it corresponds to low resistance referred to as the Parallel 
(P) state (‘0’). When the free layer has magnetic orientation in the opposite direction, it corresponds to higher resistance 
and is referred to as the Antiparallel (AP) state (‘1’) [35]. The two states are separated by an energy barrier Eb and 
corresponding retention time 𝜏𝜏= 𝜏𝜏0 exp ቀ𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏𝑘𝑘𝐵𝐵𝑇𝑇

ቁ. Here 𝑘𝑘𝐵𝐵 denotes the Boltzmann constant and T denotes 
temperature. The energy barrier is determined by the interfacial magnetic anisotropy in the case of perpendicular 
magnetic tunnel junctions [36]-[38]. If 𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏 is chosen to be small enough, then random thermally activated switching 
may occur at room temperature. For example, 𝐸𝐸𝑏𝑏< 16𝑘𝑘𝐵𝐵𝑇𝑇 resulted in bitstream generation at a rate of milliseconds in 
[24], although much faster bit generation has been demonstrated in devices with smaller energy barriers or devices 
where the energy barrier is temporarily reduced by voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) [24], [39]-[41].

Figure 1. (a) Generation of stochastic bitstream, (b) Generation of Binary Number from stochastic bitstream [42] 
In prior work, different bias voltages were applied to generate bitstreams corresponding to different input and weight 
values. It was shown that tunability from > 95% AP to > 95% P was achieved by bias voltages from -1V to +1V (figure 
2c) [24]. About 30 different bias voltages were used to generate 30 different bitstreams per MTJ. The products (XNOR) 
of two MTJs were then utilized to increase resolution of each bitstream [24] and used for inference (not for learning 
with backpropagation) of a neural network for recognition of handwritten digits from MNIST dataset. However, this 
work [24] did not consider quantization of synaptic weights and outputs, which is implemented in our current work 
with only 5 or 11 quantized states. Such quantization could lead to significant improvements in latency and energy 
efficiency for inference, without significantly sacrificing inference accuracy.
