Eye2Heart model for detailed in-silico experimentation, allowing for the testing of different physiological states and
their impact on ocular health and cardiovascular dynamics.
In terms of clinical applications, the Eye2Heart model holds significant potential for early detection of cardio-
vascular dysfunction, particularly through CRA waveform analysis. Previous work, such as that by the group [28],
has demonstrated how the analysis of the CRA waveform can yield valuable insights into cardiovascular health. The
integration of CRA waveform modeling within the Eye2Heart framework would allow for detailed and personalized
simulation and analysis of how cardiovascular dysfunction, such as impaired heart pumping efficiency, can manifest
in the retinal circulation.
Nevertheless, certain limitations are acknowledged. Discrepancies such as slight underestimations in EDV and
ESV, as well as deviations in Ees and Ea, likely stem from model simplifications, assumptions in pressure-volume
relationships, and the exclusion of individual variability. Additionally, the "eye branch" simplification, while com-
putationally efficient, does not fully represent the complexity of non-retinal ocular circulation and represents only a
single eye. Furthermore, the use of 0D modeling and assumptions regarding parameterization, such as differences
between males and females [34], introduces potential limitations in accuracy.
Despite these limitations, the Eye2Heart model represents a significant advancement in the integrated modeling
of cardiovascular and ocular systems. By providing a unified framework, this model offers a valuable tool for ex-
ploring the complex interactions between these systems and for investigating the potential impact of ocular dynamics
on overall cardiovascular health. Future work should focus on refining model parameters, incorporating individual
variability, and expanding the model to include more detailed representations of ocular substructures and both eyes.
This expansion would enable the investigation of personalized treatments and their differential effects on each eye. To
better account for individual variability, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification, as proposed in [24], should
be incorporated. Furthermore, extending the model to include a 4-chamber heart and both eyes would enhance its pre-
dictive capabilities, thereby improving its potential clinical applications for diagnosing and managing conditions that
affect both the eye and the heart.
In conclusion, this study opens new avenues for experimental research investigating the relationship between pa-
tients’ visual field deterioration and cardiac health. Understanding these connections could pave the way for new
diagnostic approaches that link ocular hemodynamics with systemic cardiovascular conditions. This novel coupling
of cardiovascular and retinal circulation models represents a significant step forward in exploring the interdisciplinary
relationship between heart function and ocular health, with the potential to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strate-
gies in both fields.
