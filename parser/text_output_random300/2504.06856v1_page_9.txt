We would like to thank Roman Chulkevich for his assistance
with the computing cluster and Ksenia Ushatskaya for her
help with the visualization of the generated textures used
in the paper teaser. Special thanks go to Maxim Kodryan,
whose mere existence made this research journey consider-
ably more enjoyable. This research was supported in part
through computational resources of HPC facilities at HSE
University.
