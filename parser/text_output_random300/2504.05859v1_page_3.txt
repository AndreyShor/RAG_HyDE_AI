When a semiconductor absorbs photons with energy above its band gap, hot carriers 
with excess kinetic energy are generated. One solution of harvesting such energy, 
termed as hot carrier solar cells (HCSCs)1, is to extract hot carriers to the higher-energy 
band of energy selective contacts (ESCs) before cooling, as illustrated in Figure 1c. The 
perfect HCSCs can increase the efficiency up to 66%2, about twice the Shockleyâ€“
Queisser (SQ) limit2,3. However, this approach is extremely challenging4, since most of 
the excess energy is quickly lost to the lattice by optical phonon emission typically 
within several picoseconds (ps). Although efforts have been devoted to slowing down 
the phonon-assisted cooling process, such as exploiting hot-phonon bottleneck effect5,6 
and trapping hot carriers in higher-energy side valleys7, no HCSCs beyond the SQ limit 
have been realized yet. 
Two-dimensional (2D) materials act as a promising platform for the hot-electron 
extraction owing to the strong carrier-carrier scattering, which can compete with the 
electron-phonon scattering due to the reduced screening effect6. In addition, 2D 
heterostructures can be fabricated by choosing plentiful types of material and possess 
the high electrical-tunability8, which could offer abundant opportunities in optimizing 
the efficiency of hot-electron extraction. For example, graphene can efficiently convert 
absorbed photon energy to hot carriers9, which can be extracted to the higher-energy 
band of adjacent semiconductor10,11. However, zero band gap of graphene is not favored 
for photovoltaic applications, since most of hot carriers will relax to the Dirac point
