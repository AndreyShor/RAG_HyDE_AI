Also, in our examples the point at z = ∞is always another MUM-point. The correspond-
ing local expansion is related to that around z = 0 by a coordinate and K¨ahler transformation

for some e1, e2 ∈N. For reasons that will become clear in a moment, we call ρ = e1/e2 the
regulator. The holomorphic ambiguity then takes the form

The lower and the upper bound of the last sum are respectively determined by the regularity
of the genus g ≥2 free energies in a large volume limit. The numerator pC
i for i = 1, . . . , nC
is a polynomial of degree (deg ∆C
i )2g−2 −1 and is ﬁxed by the gap condition at ∆C
i = 0 that
we will discuss in a moment. On the other hand, the numerator pHC
i
for i = 1, . . . , nHC is
a polynomial of degree (deg ∆HC
i
)g−1 −1. There does not appear to be an ordinary gap at
the hyperconifold points and therefore we ﬁx the pHC
i
, just like the coeﬃcients bn, by using
additional boundary conditions and the Castelnuovo vanishing condition.
Before we discuss the gap condition, let us brieﬂy recall that the monodromy around a
conifold point always takes the form
MC = Id4×4 −mΣT⃗v ⃗v T ,
m ∈N ,
⃗v ∈Z4 ,
(3.26)
where ⃗v is a primitive 3-cycle in the mirror Wk that shrinks at the conifold point, in the basis
AI, BJ from (3.10), and the symplectic intersection form Σ is given by
Σ =



The coeﬃcient m here is identical to the exponent ci that appears in (3.21) for the corre-
sponding discriminant component.
The so-called gap condition, ﬁrst described in [9, 56], amounts to the conjecture that
Fg(tc) = (−1)g−1B2g
2g(2g −2)
m
t2g−2
c
+ O(t0
c) ,
(3.28)
where tc is a local ﬂat coordinate around this conifold point. The coeﬃcient in (3.28), for
m = 1, has been determined in [57]. A correct choice for tc is the analytic continuation of the
period ⃗v · ⃗Π, normalized by a regular period that takes value 1 at the conifold point. More
details on the choice of normalization can be found in [9, 58].
