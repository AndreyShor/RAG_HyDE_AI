4.4. Lower Regularity of the Riemann Solutions with Four-Shock Interactions. The
final problem is the Riemann problem with four-shock interaction structure for the isentropic
Euler system. As discussed in [12] for the Riemann problem with four-shock interactions for
the potential flow, initially in the x–coordinates, the scale-invariant domains Λi ⊂R2, for
i = 1, 2, 3, 4, are defined by
Λ1 =

x ∈R2 : −θ14 < θ < θ12
	
,
Λ2 =

x ∈R2 : θ12 < θ < π −θ32
	
,
Λ3 =

x ∈R2 : π −θ32 < θ < π + θ34
	
,
Λ4 =

x ∈R2 : π + θ34 < θ < 2π −θ14
	
,
where θ is the polar angle of point x ∈R2 and the four parameters θ12, θ32, θ34, θ14 ∈(0, π
2 ). On
each Λi, suitable constant states (i) with values (ρi, vi) are given for the Riemann initial data
such that any two neighboring states are connected by exactly one planar shock discontinuity,
which satisfies the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions and the entropy condition for the isentropic
Euler system. As introduced in [12], under the symmetry assumption that θ12 = θ14 = θ1,
θ32 = θ34 = θ2, and states in Λ2 and Λ4 are the same constants, and under a structure assumption
that one forward shock is generated between states (1) and (j) and one backward shock is
generated between states (3) and (j), governed by the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions (2.9) and
the entropy condition (2.12), we expect the Riemann problem develops a Riemann solution with
the structure as shown in Fig. 4.8.
Figure 4.8. Riemann problem with four-shock interactions
On the symmetry line that is the dashed line shown in Fig. 4.8, the velocity satisfies (2.13)
with ν being the vertical direction. At the interaction points P1 and P4, based on an argument
similar to the one for the regular shock reflection problem at the reflection point P0, with the
symmetry line and state (2) in Fig. 4.8 corresponding to Γwedge and state (1) in Fig. 4.1, there
exists a detachment angle θd ∈(0, π
2 ) depending on the data such that, for θ1, θ2 ∈(0, θd
w), there
exist two constant states (5) and (6) in Λ5 and Λ6, respectively, satisfying the Rankine-Hugoniot
conditions (2.9) and the entropy condition (2.12). One corresponds to the strong shock and the
other to the weak shock. We always select the weak one because it expects to be stable in general.
Then there exists a sonic angle θs ∈(0, θd] such that the state at P1 (or P4) is pseudo-supersonic
if θ1 ∈(0, θs) (or θ2 ∈(0, θs)) and is pseudo-subsonic if θ1 ∈(θs, θd] (or θ2 ∈(θs, θd]).
When θ1 ∈(0, θs) at P1, there exist points P2 and P6 on Γ1
sonic (the sonic curve of state (6))
such that shocks P1P2 and P1P6 are straight shocks and the state in Λ6 with boundaries P1P2,
Γ1
sonic, and P1P6 is the constant state (6). Similarly, when θ2 ∈(0, θs) at P4, there exist points
P3 and P5 on Γ2
sonic (the sonic curve of state (5)) such that shocks P3P4 and P4P5 are straight
shocks and the state in Λ5 with boundaries P3P4, Γ2
sonic, and P4P5 is the constant state (5). On
the other hand, when θ1 ∈[θs, θd] at P1 (or when θ2 ∈[θs, θd] at P4), the sonic arc, the straight
shocks, and Λ6 (or Λ5) disappear near point P1 (or P4), and state (6) (or state (5)) is the limit
of solution (ρ, v) in Ωas the point tends to P1 (or P4). It is direct to see that
The tangents to Γ1
shock at P2 and P3 are not parallel to each other,
(4.6)
where P2 is replaced by P1 if state (6) is subsonic and P3 is replaced by P4 if state (5) is subsonic.
