where the q±
k = qk ± ¯qk. The basis elements can be separated in to two categories: Σ (total)
singlet, gluon g and Ti form the singlet sector; while we refer to V as (total) valence distribution
and to Vi non-singlet distributions. Here, we are considering the case of pure QCD evolution
and neglecting any photon PDF contribution, although a generalization is possible, see Ref. [11]
for details. For any phenomenological application also the top t, ¯t PDFs are always neglected.
In the evolution basis only Σ and g are coupled via

while the distributions V , Ti, Vi evolve all independently. The polarized DGLAP evolution is
analogue with all the quantities fi and Pij replaced by ∆fi and ∆Pij respectively.

In principle 7 different splitting functions combinations are possible, 4 in the singlet sector
Eq. (1.63) and 3 for the non-singlet Pns,−, Pns,+, Pns,s with the total valance and singlet-to-
singlet splitting given by
Pns,v = Pns,+ + Pns,s ,
(1.65)
Pqq = Pns,+ + Pqq,ps .
(1.66)
This separation facilitates to isolate perturbative suppressed contributions as Pns,s, which starts
at NNLO (i.e. O(a3
s)), while Pqq,ps is O(a2
s). Moreover, at LO one finds that Pqq = Pns,−= Pns,+.
Symmetry considerations imply that polarized non-singlet splitting functions coincide with the
spin-averaged ones to all orders after they are swapped as follows:
∆Pns,± = Pns,∓

The interpretation of Pij(x, µ), as the probability to find the parton i inside the parton of type
j with a given momentum fraction x and energy less than µ, allows us to formulate some
