which may be expressed in terms of particle number or density factors. For the kilonova and 
galactic mass rates we use the semiempirical models using a range of mass values to match 
observations and the three standard galactic functions to match spiral, elliptical, and dwarf 
galaxies [74,75].

where γv is the relativistic Lorentz factor. Here we have established a direct link between the 
MvdW EoS parameters and nucleosynthetic yields by modifying opacity equations and 
establishing a model that can be used to explore the element production rate differences with and 
without massive neutrinos. The neutrino energies, and mass values, are in the cross sections 
needed for each rate value λi . 
3. KN and Galactic Results 
The r process is a rapid neutron capture that occurs when the neutron flux is high and the capture 
is faster than the decay rate thereby producing a neutron rich environment that can be far from 
the valley of stability. In the actinides (89 < Z < 103) production of 232Th, and 238U occurs, with a 
peak near A~130, in the lanthanides (57 < Z < 71) 139La, 150Sm, and 152Eu are produced with a 
peak near A~87.  The s process dominates in low to moderate neutron flux regions capturing 
neutrons slowly so that beta decay may occur between captures. The details of the reaction chain 
used here are given in Appendix A. In Fig. 1 we show the production rates for light and heavy 
elements as the MvdW EoS parameters are varied for a kilonova event.
