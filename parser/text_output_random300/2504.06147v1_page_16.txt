i ̸= j. Some of these solutions will lead to the same e−t, some have to be discarded because they
correspond to some matter fields becoming massless10. Whenever σj = αj with α = e
2πi
k , whereby
σ1 + . . . + σk = 0, there is a Coulomb branch at ζ →−∞.
To show this, we follow the arguments in [9, §4.4]. In the strongly coupled phase at ζ < 0 the
determinantal U(1) subgroup U(1)0 is broken and the p-fields get a VEV. At large but finite −ζ
the gauge sector decouples because the broken U(1) dynamically generates t-dependent twisted
masses for the σ-fields everywhere except at ζ →−∞where the masses disappear. We have to
understand the effective potential on the Coulomb branch for large but finite −ζ. We give the field
strength large, distinct eigenvalues eσa such that

a=1
eσa = 0.

The eigenvalues set an energy scale m. The chiral matter fields ϕ all have masses of order m due
to the effective scalar potential having terms
Ueff = . . . + |eσϕ|2 + . . .
(2.46)
The massive fields must be integrated out at energy scales below m. The effective theory consists
of a theory of k chiral multiplets P α that are charged only under U(1)0. There is an effective
FI-parameter ζ0(m) = −ζ ≫0. When the energy is decreased, the FI-parameter ζ0 runs towards
smaller values11 and will become negative. In this region one can integrate out the P-fields. Doing
this, one gets an effective potential for the scalar component σ0 of the vector superfield Σ0 associated
to U(1)0 with the eσa being treated as parameters. Since on the Coulomb branch the other matter
fields have been massive in the first place, the effective potential is the same as (2.36) but we now
single out the field σ0 by defining
σa = eσa −σ0
k .
(2.47)
Integrating out σ0 yields
σ0 = f(e−t, eσ).
(2.48)
This should be interpreted as follows. The Higgsed U(1)0-sector dynamically creates twisted masses
σ0/k = f(e−t, eσ)/k for the chirals of the strongly coupled theory. Reinserting this into the effective
potential, creates a potential for the remaining σ-fields associated to the residual gauge symmetry.
This lifts the Coulomb branch as long as ζ ≪0 but finite.
Let us show how this works for our model. Following the discussion of [9], we denote by σ0 the
σ-field associated to the determinantal U(1). We define
σ1 = eσ1 −σ0,
σ2 = eσ2
σ3 = −eσ1 −eσ2.
(2.49)
Inserting this into (2.36) we get
Weff =tσ0 −3(eσ1 −σ0)(log(eσ1 −σ0) −1) −3eσ2(log(eσ2) −1)
−3(−eσ1 −eσ2)(log(−eσ1 −eσ2) −1) −3σ0(log(σ0) −1).
(2.50)
10For example, in the Rødland model one has to discard solutions fixed by the Weyl group action because those
would correspond to W-bosons being massless. This reasoning does not apply to our model which does not have
W-bosons, so solutions fixed by the Z3 must be kept.
11Note that the effective theory is not Calabi-Yau, so the effective FI parameter undergoes RG flow.
