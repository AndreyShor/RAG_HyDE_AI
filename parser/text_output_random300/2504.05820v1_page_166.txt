sponding publications. Specifically, full covariance matrices are provided only for the HERMES
measurement of [346] and for the STAR measurements of [357, 363, 359, 360, 358]. Most
notably, the latter include correlations between single-inclusive jet and dijet bins, a fact that
allows us to include all the measurements at the same time in the fit. Information on correlations
is generally not provided by other experiments, except for the highlight of a multiplicative, fully
correlated, uncertainty due to the beam polarization.
5.1.2. Perturbative accuracy
The perturbative accuracy of the theoretical predictions corresponding to the measurements
described in Section 5.1.1 relies on the perturbative accuracy of matrix elements and of DGLAP
splitting functions, which are both expanded as a series in the strong coupling as. In this context,
this work pursues two goals: first, to include corrections up to NNLO in both; and, second, to
include MHOUs arising from the truncation of the expansion series to a finite accuracy.
The first goal is achieved by deploying a set of computational tools, available as open-source
software, that we specifically designed for PDF fitting. As already mentioned, these include:
Yadism (Section 2.1.2) for the computation of the polarized inclusive structure function g1;
PineAPPL [114] (interfaced with the private pieces of software in [354, 361, 362] used to
compute the polarized proton-proton collision spin asymmetries) for the construction of PDF-
independent interpolation grids; EKO (Section 2.1.1) for PDF evolution. Each of these pieces
of software has been extended to handle the computation of the polarized observables at
