CAMulator
Figure 5: Regression of the anomalous Z500 field on the leading principal during DJF for the PNA region (left column,
20°–85°N, 120°E–120°W) and the NAO (right column, 20°–80°N, 90°W–40°E) over the years 1979–2014. Results are
shown for CAMulator (top row) and CAM6 (bottom row). The explained variance of each mode is shown in the top
right of each panel
model’s physical consistency and predictive skill. Machine learning models, particularly those trained to minimize mean
squared error, often struggle to capture extremes because they tend to favor the mean state over rare, high-magnitude
events. However, CAMulator does not exhibit a strong tendency to underpredict extremes. We hypothesize that this may
be due to its training methodology, which is limited to two prediction time steps (out to 12 hours), allowing it to better
preserve variability. Supporting this, CAMulator’s kinetic energy and potential temperature spectra (see Supplemental
Fig. 1S) show minimal smoothing at smaller spatial scales, a common issue in data-driven models [see, Rasp et al.,
2024] that can lead to weakened variability.
Figure 7 presents the annual maximum 6-hourly 2m temperature and precipitation at each grid point for CAM6 and
CAMulator, with differences shown in the bottom row. Overall, CAMulator successfully captures the spatial patterns
of extreme events, but some notable biases emerge. For 2m temperature, CAMulator overpredicts Arctic extreme
temperatures, particularly in regions dominated by sea ice and land ice. This bias is expected, as CAMulator lacks
explicit sea-ice and land-ice interactions—a limitation that will be addressed in future versions. For precipitation,
CAMulator underpredicts extremes in the deep tropics while overpredicting them in the mid-latitudes. Notably, the
region off the coast of Japan exhibits a strong positive bias in extreme precipitation, suggesting that CAMulator may be
overestimating the intensity of tropical cyclones in this region.
