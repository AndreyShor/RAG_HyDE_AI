The [U(1)] is put to take into account the case that U(1) exists as gauge symmetry and the
case that it is broken (see the breaking of SO(12) with scalar in the 77 rep in eq. (124))
leaving a U(1) as a remaining global symmetry.
On the other hand, as noted earlier,
SU(4) ⊃SU(2) × SU(2)
4 = (2, 1) + (1, 2) .
(125)
Therefore, after all the breakings, we obtain:
SU(2) × SU(2) × SO(10) × [U(1)]
{[(2, 1) + (1, 2)}{(16)(1) + (16)(−1)}
= 16L(1) + 16L(−1) + 16R(1) + 16R(−1)
(126)
and since 16R(1) = 16L(−1) and 16L(1) = 16R(−1), the above expression becomes:
= 2 × 16L(−1) + 2 × 16R(−1).
(127)
Finally, choosing to keep only the −1 eigenvalue of γ5 we obtain:
2 × 16L(−1) .
(128)
Similarly to the general discussion we presented earlier in this section concerning the
Weyl condition in D and 4 dimensions, namely that they are independent to each other,
the same holds for the Majorana condition. If we impose the Majorana condition in higher
dimensions we are still free to impose the Majorana condition once more in lower dimensions,
taking into account the rule for the non-compact groups SO(p, q) mentioned earlier in the
present section. Therefore if we impose in addition the Weyl also the Majorana condition in
higher dimensions we can still impose the same conditions in lower dimensions, respecting
the known rules for each case.
Therefore, given the above analysis the gauge group describing the Internal Interactions
is CSO(18)(SO(6)) = SO(10) × U(1)global, while the type of spinors that we have is governed
by the signature of (p −q) that permits the imposition of Weyl and Majorana conditions in
higher and four dimensions leading to one generation of 16L in SO(10). Obviously, the other
fermion generations are introduced as usual with more spinors in SO(2, 16).
An additional comment is necessary concerning the case of FG. As it was explained in
[44], when attempting to unify FG with internal interactions, along the lines of Unification of
CG with SO(10) [48], the difficulties that in principle one is facing are that fermions should
(a) be chiral in order to have a chance to survive in low energies and not receive masses as
the Planck scale, (b) appear in a matrix representation, since the constructed FG is a matrix
model. Then, given that the Majorana condition can be imposed, a solution satisfying the
conditions (a) and (b) above was suggested in [44]: We choose to start with SO(6) × SO(12)
as the initial gauge theory with fermions in the (4, 32) representation satisfying in this way
the criteria to obtain chiral fermions in tensorial representation of a fuzzy space. Another
important point is that using the gauge-theoretic formulation of gravity to construct the FG
model, one is led to gauge the SO(6) × U(1) ∼SO(2, 4) × U(1). Therefore, from this point
of view, there only exists a small difference in comparison to the CG case.
