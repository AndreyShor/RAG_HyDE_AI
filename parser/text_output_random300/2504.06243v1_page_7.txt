Thermal State
Now, consider the thermal state,
nk =
1
e|k|/T −1
.
(2.18)
At high energies, |k|/T ≫1 and nk decays exponentially: the beta function is simply the vacuum
beta function. On the other hand, in the high-temperature limit, |k|/T ≪1, the Bose-Einstein
distribution reduces to the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution,
nk = T
|k| ,
(2.19)
which is a power-law distribution with γ = 1. This means that the dimension of the interaction D
in (2.7) is D = D−5. The interaction is marginal in five spacetime dimension, where we can apply
the result (2.17) for the beta function,
µdλ
dµ =
3
32π2Tλ2 ,
(2.20)
where we added the normalization factor of T in nk, which was not included in the derivation of
(2.17).
To be clear: in four spacetime dimensions and at high energies (µ ≫T), the beta function in
the thermal state is the standard beta function for λϕ4 field theory. At low energies (µ ≪T), the
thermal state follows a power-law occupation number (2.19). In five spacetime dimensions, the
interaction in this state is marginal, with the beta function given by (2.20). While the vacuum beta
function describes the flow of the coupling due to interactions with quantum vacuum fluctuations,
the beta function (2.20) describes the running of the coupling due to interactions with thermal
bath fluctuations.
3. General Case
In this section, we consider a general complex scalar field with a quartic interaction governed
by a Hamiltonian of the form:
H =
Z
ddk
(2π)dωk|Ψk|2 +
Z

Y
i=1
ddpi
(2π)d(2π)dδ(⃗p12;34)λp1p2p3p4Ψ†
1Ψ†
2Ψ3Ψ4 ,
(3.1)
where ⃗k is the spatial momentum, d is the spatial dimension, and we introduced the notation
⃗p12;34 ≡⃗p1+⃗p2−⃗p3−⃗p4. Unlike the case in the previous section, here there is no assumption of
Lorentz invariance. The interaction and dispersion relation are homogeneous functions of degree
