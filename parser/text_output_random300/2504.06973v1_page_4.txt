Fig. 2: Comparison of CNO lines in the co-added spectra of
HIP 15429 (black) and the B5 supergiant standard star Eta Canis
Majoris (purple) presumed to be of similar temperature, surface
gravity and metallicity. Carbon and oxygen appear to be depleted
in HIP 15429.
of Fig. 1 shows three epoch spectra observed within a 10-day
period, illustrating the high variability of the central absorption
feature. The short variability timescale, corresponding to ≲5%
of the orbital period (see Sect. 4), suggests that these profile
changes are not due to the superposition of the narrow-lined
star’s spectrum, nor does the absorption feature trace the com-
panion star.
4. Orbital analysis
We measured RVs of the narrow-lined star by cross-correlating
the data with a synthetic template spectrum. We used a spectral
template from the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmo-
spheres grids for OB-type stars (Hainich et al. 2019, see Sect. 6
for a more detailed description of the code) with temperature
Teff = 15 kK, surface gravity log g = 2.6 and solar metallic-
ity. Cross-correlation was performed in eight wavelength regions
of equal size, each 250 Å wide, spanning the range of 4000 to
6000 Å. RVs were determined by averaging measurements from
all wavelength regions, with uncertainties derived as the standard
deviation of the RVs across these regions. The most important
spectral lines contributing to the RV measurements include He I
absorption lines (e.g., He I λ4026, λ4144, λ4388, λ4922, λ5116
and λ5876) and narrow metal lines such as Mg II, Ca II, Si II/III
and Fe II/III lines. We masked wavelength regions with known
telluric or interstellar features and the Balmer lines, where there
is substantial contribution from the companion star. We cross-
checked the measured RVs by fitting Voigt profiles to individ-
ual spectral lines, including multiple He I and metal lines (e.g.,
Mg II). Voigt profiles were chosen because they provided bet-
ter fits to the slightly broader line wings compared to Gaussian
profiles. The fitting was performed using the funcFit module
of the PyAstronomy Python package. To determine RVs and
their uncertainties, we averaged the RVs obtained from all fitted
lines and calculated the standard deviation among these mea-
surements as the RV uncertainty. Comparing the RVs from the
Voigt profile fitting and template cross-correlation, we found the
results to be consistent within 2-σ uncertainties.
We did not attempt to measure RVs for the companion star
because its only discernible feature is the emission component
in the Balmer lines, which is highly variable on short timescales
(see Fig. 1) and therefore not suitable for RV measurements.
We used a nested sampling framework to determine the
binary orbit. In particular, we used the algorithm MLFriends
(Buchner 2016, 2019) as part of the UltraNest package (Buch-
ner 2021) to infer posterior probability distribution functions
for orbital parameters. The RV curve is parameterized by
six orbital parameters (KB, P, M0, e, ω, vz), which we fitted to-
gether with an additional jitter term s to account for poten-
tially underestimated RV uncertainties. Here, KB is the RV
semi-amplitude of the narrow-lined star, P denotes the or-
bital period, and M0
=
2πt0/P is the mean anomaly at a
reference time t0. e and ω are the orbital eccentricity and
the argument of the pericenter, and vz denotes the system’s
barycentric velocity. The assumed prior distributions are un-
informative and uniform for all parameters with prior ranges
KB ∈[0, 200] km/s, P ∈[200, 250] d, M0, ω ∈[0, 2π], e ∈
[0.0, 0.99], s ∈[0.01, 10] km/s, vz ∈[−100, 100] km/s. The as-
sumed log-likelihood function has the form

ties σvrad,i and predicted RVs vrad,model, summed over all available
epochs ti. Given the different wavelength regime and higher res-
olution of the obtained spectra with respect to Gaia RVS spectra,
as well as the good orbital coverage, we opted not to include the
DR3 orbital solution in the prior or likelihood of the parameter
inference, but rather to get an independent estimate of the orbital
parameters.
In Fig. 3, the results of the orbital analysis are presented,
showing the posterior samples of period and eccentricity and
the maximum a posteriori (MAP) phase folded orbit model. The
posterior samples are clearly unimodal and clustered around an
orbital solution with a period of P = 221 ± 1 d and eccentricity
e = 0.52±0.03. The mean values and uncertainties for all orbital
parameters are listed in Table 1. The derived orbital solution is
broadly consistent with the spectroscopic solution published in
Gaia DR3. However, we infer slightly higher period and higher
eccentricity compared to the DR3 values; PDR3 = 217 ± 2 d,
eDR3 = 0.41 ± 0.05 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2023a).
5. Spectral disentangling
We performed spectral disentangling in an attempt to separate
the observed composite spectra into the intrinsic spectra of the
two stellar components. To increase the robustness of our re-
sults, we used two independent methods, namely the shift-and-
add technique (Marchenko et al. 1998; González & Levato 2006;
Shenar et al. 2020) and a method based on singular value decom-
position following Simon & Sturm (1994).
The shift-and-add technique has previously been used to dis-
entangle spectra in several bloated stripped star systems (e.g.,
Bodensteiner et al. 2020a; Villaseñor et al. 2023). This method
starts with an initial guess, typically a flat spectrum for the com-
panion and Doppler-shifted, coadded spectra for the primary
star, and iteratively refines both components. The algorithm is
