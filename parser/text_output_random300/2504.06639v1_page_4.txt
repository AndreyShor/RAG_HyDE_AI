was utilized to calculate the energy levels, radiative rates,
autoionization rates, and DR cross sections and rates as
implemented in the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) [43–45].
The relativistic distorted-wave approximation was em-
ployed to describe the continuum states. For the calcula-
tion of wave functions and energy levels corresponding to
the initial states, intermediate doubly excited states, and
radiative final states, contributions from electron correla-
tions, quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects, and Breit
interactions were systematically accounted for, ensuring
accurate determination of energy levels and wave func-
tions.
Figure 1 illustrates the total DR cross sections for
the recombination of Y+ into Y. The resolution width
is set to 100 meV, modeled as a Lorentzian profile con-
voluted with a Gaussian. The calculations include Ry-
dberg states up to n = 6, . . . , 35.
A strong DR reso-
nance is observed near the threshold, accompanied by rel-
atively weaker resonance peaks at approximately 0.3 eV
and 0.6 eV. These peaks are attributed to the 4d5s 3DJ
states (where J = 1, 2, 3).
Additionally, a small reso-
nance around 2 eV is associated with the 5s5p 3PJ states
(where J = 0, 1, 2).
The DR resonance strength for Y+ is approximately
an order of magnitude higher than that of previous ions
studied by our group [37, 45]. The presence of strong res-
onances at low energies suggests that DR is dominated
by optically allowed core excitations, and it is a dom-
inant recombination mechanism for Y+ under various
plasma conditions, particularly in astrophysical environ-
ments. Given the exceptionally strong resonance near the
threshold, Y+ is an excellent candidate for experimental
validation, as background effects are expected to be min-
imal, enhancing detection feasibility.

mental challenges remain, particularly in distinguishing
the DR signal from radiative recombination, which is typ-
ically prominent at near-threshold energies. Effectively
separating these contributions will be crucial for future
measurements. The findings of this work could facilitate
both observational and experimental studies of Y+ in the
near future.
The total DR spectrum for Sr+ recombining to neu-
tral Sr is presented in Figure 2, with a resolution width
set to 100 meV. The DR cross section exhibits charac-
teristic resonance peaks, arising from the capture of free
electrons into autoionizing Rydberg states via core exci-
tations (5s →5p, 4d). A strong DR resonance feature is
observed near zero energy; however, its exact origin re-
mains unidentified. There is a strong possibility that it
results from a theoretical artifact associated with the Ry-
dberg state n = 6, as observed in our calculations, since
no such excited states have been reported in the literature
at such low energies. Another prominent resonance ap-
pears at approximately 2.3 eV, primarily originating from
the 4p64d 2D5/2 and 2D3/2 states, with the 2D5/2 state
being the dominant contributor. Additionally, a strong
DR resonance is observed around 2.7 eV, attributed to
the 4p65p 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 states. These states are also
responsible for the knee-like resonances observed around
3 eV.
Among the ions studied in this work, the DR spec-
trum of Sr+ exhibits the weakest signal strength, possi-
bly presenting significant challenges for experimental ob-
servation with currently available setups. Its DR signal
strength is approximately one to two orders of magni-
tude smaller than that of the other ions studied in this
work as well as in previous works[37, 45]. To detect this
spectrum experimentally, it would be necessary to signif-
icantly reduce background noise.
