to circulate concessions while retaining the de-rule and de-obligation in the absence of 
guaranteed reciprocity. From the perspective of (a) the market economy, it is essential 
to mitigate the enclosure of the commons and recover community relationships. To put 
this into practice, evoking baseline communism and increasing We-turn is necessary. 
(d) Concession economy: More specifically, it is necessary to eliminate the 
enclosure in capitalism–that is, the division between the wealthy and poor–and share 
the means of production, funds, and research as concessions, thereby promoting 
community cooperation. To encourage and continue circulating concessions, using 
cooperative platforms [36,37], for example, is beneficial. With the support of 
information technology, building a network of security and trust is possible to connect 
each person’s contribution and reception as baseline communism and to compensate 
for “fundamental incapability” as “We” even without direct reciprocal relationships. 
 This is the first study to present the feasibility of a concession economy 
from the network model perspective. Note that this study is a mathematical evaluation 
based on a primitive model and remains to be verified in the real world. Future 
challenges include the development of a cooperative platform and empirical research 
through fieldwork to implement a concession economy. In parallel with these efforts, 
we would like to promote the transformation from a capitalist economy to a concession 
economy through social activities that spread baseline communism and We-turn to 
society.
