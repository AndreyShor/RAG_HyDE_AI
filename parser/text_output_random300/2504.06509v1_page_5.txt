1.3)/Ta(0.7)/[Pd(0.7)/Co(0.3)]4/Pd(5) (unit in nm). The core structure, illustrated in Fig. 1(b), 
consists of: (1) Fixed layer: CoFeB(1.3)/Ta(0.7)/[Pd(0.7)/Co(0.3)]4, providing a stable 
reference magnetization; (2) Free layer: CoFeB(1), positioned beneath the MgO barrier, whose 
magnetization is tunable via voltage; (3) Coupling layer: Co(0.3)/Pd(0.7)/Co(0.3), generating 
the interlayer exchange coupling field; (4) Spacer layer: Ru/Ta, mediating the interlayer 
exchange coupling between the free and coupling layers. A relatively thick MgO barrier (2 nm) 
was chosen to minimize current-driven effects while enabling the application of higher voltage. 
After rapid thermal annealing, the perpendicular anisotropy of the stack was confirmed via out-
of-plane M-H loop measurements (Fig. 1(c)). The three-step magnetization reversal process, 
occurring from +400 mT to -400 mT, corresponds to the sequential switching of the free layer, 
coupling layer, and fixed layer. The opposite signs of the free and coupling layers‚Äô switching 
field indicate antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange coupling at zero magnetic field. Patterned 
nanoscale pillars of various diameters (100‚Äì2000 nm) were fabricated via photolithography 
and electron-beam lithography (Methods). An oblique view of the patterned device is shown 
in the top-right corner of Fig. 1(b). To facilitate high-frequency electrical excitation, a specially 
designed electrode pattern was implemented to minimize overlap between the top and bottom 
electrodes, enabling efficient GHz frequency pulse injection into the MTJ pillar via a ground-
signal-ground (GSG) probe. Fig. 1(d) presents the resistance-field (R-H) loop of a 500 nm 
device, revealing distinct resistance states corresponding to different magnetization alignments. 
The measured tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio is ~11%, with a resistance-area (RA) 
product of 3.93√ó 104 Œ© ‚àôŒºùëö2. A size-dependent resistance analysis, presented in the Extended 
Data Fig. 1(b), aligns well with theoretical expectations.
