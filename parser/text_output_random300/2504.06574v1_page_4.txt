1. Initialise the system
— Set the pass count to 1
— Determine the initial condition of the state vector ⃗u1(t1) and the pass-specific parameters ⃗λ1
2. Simulate dynamics during a single pass scene
— During the n-th pass scene, ⃗un(tn) evolves according to a system of ODEs (1) with parameters ⃗θ and ⃗λn:
d⃗un/dtn = ⃗f(tn, ⃗un; ⃗θ,⃗λn) for tn ∈[0, T]
3. Terminate the simulation if a termination condition has been satisfied
— Check three conditions: pass intercept, ball-out, and the maximum number of passes
4. Transition to the next pass scene
— Determine the next pass-specific parameters ⃗λn+1 and the initial condition for ⃗un+1(tn+1) stochastically
based on the current parameters ⃗λn and the final state of the current pass scene ⃗un(T)
— Update the pass count from n to n + 1
5. Go back to step 2
Figure 2:
Overview of our model. (a) A game comprises a sequence of pass scenes and transitions between
successive pass scenes. (b) Our model breaks down into five steps, through which the state vector during the
n-th pass scene, ⃗un(tn), and the pass count evolve.
