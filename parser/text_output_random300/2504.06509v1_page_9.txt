We investigate the impact of voltage amplitude on switching under a fixed magnetic field 
(Methods). Fig. 4(a) illustrates the switching probability as a function of pulse width across 
multiple voltage levels for a 500 nm device, with all curves well-fitted by a sigmoid function. 
The switching behavior is deterministic, with the probability approaching 1 as the pulse width 
increases. Higher voltage amplitudes reduce the required pulse width for a given switching 
probability. Notably, the device remains switchable even at the minimum pulse width 
supported by the pulse generator (0.1 ns, generator 1 in Method). To further explore the 
switching speed limit, we employed a shorter pulse generator (generator 2 in Method) with 
fixed output of 5 V (yielding 10 V across the MTJ). This setup achieved a switching time of 
87.5 ps (Extended Data Fig. 2(a)), with a rise time of 40 ps, highlighting an exceptionally short 
incubation time. 
The pulse width corresponding to 50% switching probability is extracted and plotted as a 
function of voltage in Fig. 4(b). The data is well-described by:  
V = A
τ + B,
(1) 
where V represents the voltage and τ denotes the pulse width and A, B are fitting parameters. 
Similar trends are observed across different device sizes (Extended Data Fig. 3(a)). This 
relationship resembles the super-threshold STT regime, indicating a precessional switching 
mechanism41,42. Following a similar derivation in the STT case, we derive an analogous 
expression for voltage-induced torque based on the single-domain model, yielding the 
following equations (Supplementary Section 3): 
A =
(1 + α2
αγμ0 ) ∙ln ( π
2θ0)
|a + b|

(2) 
B  = Hk −Hext 
|a + b| ,
(3) 
where B is equivalent to the critical voltage, a and b are VCEC and VCMA coefficient, 
respectively, represented by the effective field per volt, α is the damping constant, γ is the 
gyromagnetic ratio, μ0 is the vacuum permeability, θ0 is the initial angle of magnetization from 
easy axis, Hk is the effective anisotropy field, and Hext is the applied magnetic field measured 
relative to the loop center field. We define the numerator on the right-hand side of equation 
(2) and (3) as A' and B'. The relationships A' and B' as a function of device size are plotted 
in Extended Data Fig. 3. In these terms, the size contributions of VCMA and VCEC are 
accounted for, ensuring they do not affect the observed variations. A' generally exhibits 
an increasing trend with device size, accompanied by minor fluctuations, while B' 
remains nearly constant with similar variations. According to equation (3), although Hk 
is supposed to be the same for all the devices, B’ depends on the manually selected applied 
field (Method), contributing to the variance. Since similar fluctuations are observed in A'–
