It is common in climate change studies to separate the horizontal and vertical compo-
nents of the budgets. We define the (diffusive) evaporation as,
E ≡−Ra−1/2
 
∂q
∂z

z=0
−∂q
∂z

z=1

,
i.e. the sum of the moisture source at the bottom boundary, and the moisture sink at
the top boundary, due to diffusion. We also define the (diffusive) sensible heat flux as,
Fsh ≡−Ra−1/2
 
∂T
∂z

z=0

Equations (17) & (18) can then be written as,
P = E +

By integrating equations (19) & (20) in the horizontal, and applying the divergence
theorem and periodic horizontal boundary conditions, the domain averaged budgets
simplify to
P = E,
(21)
r = γP + Fsh,
(22)
where · denotes the horizontal average of a quantity. The simplified water budget
implies that the precipitation (moisture sink) is balanced by the evaporation (moisture
source from diffusion), whilst the energy budget implies that the radiative cooling is
balanced by the sum of heating associated with the precipitation (γP) and the sensible
heat flux (heat source from diffusion). Assuming the fluxes of buoyancy and moisture
are small at the top of the domain (relative to the surface fluxes), the energy budget
(approximately) relates the radiative cooling to the surface fluxes:
r ≈γEsurf + Fssh,
(23)
Where
Esurf
=
−Ra−1/2∂q/∂z(z
=
0)
is
the
surface
evaporation,
and
Fssh = −Ra−1/2∂T/∂z(z = 0) is the surface sensible heat flux.
Note that, as Ra →∞, E, Fsh →0, so equation (21) ⇒P →0, and the sim-
plified energy budget equation (22) becomes inconsistent unless r →0 as Ra →∞,
indicating that (steady) equilibrium cannot exist in this limit.
