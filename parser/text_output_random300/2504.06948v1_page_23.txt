Figure 15. Comparison of the two methods for different precision requirements. The left plot compares the smallest k
needed to achieve the required precision for both methods, on average. The right plot compares the average condition
number of the linear systems derived from both methods with the smallest choice of k that achieves the required
precision. The shaded area represents the mean value plus or minus the standard deviation.
linear systems. We then evaluate the condition number of each linear system and calculate the mean value
and standard deviation across the one hundred samples. The results are shown in Fig. 15.
From the left plot of Fig. 15, we observe that the average magnitude of k∗required by the Padé
approximation-based method is roughly half that of the Taylor approximation-based method. This aligns
with the third point in our theoretical comparison. The smaller k benefits both the total query complexity
(see Eq. (43)) and the gate complexity (as shown in Eq. (44)). Additionally, the average condition number of
the linear system based on the Padé approximation is smaller, further supporting the efficiency of the Padé
approximation-based method.

CONCLUSION
We propose a quantum algorithm to solve linear autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the
form (3) using the Padé approximation. By discretizing the time step-by-step with step size h, the solution
to (3) can be expressed in terms of eAh. The proposed method then uses the Padé approximation, a rational
function of Ah, to approximate eAh. The matrix rational function is encoded into a large linear system
Lm,k,p(Ah), as shown in (22), which does not explicitly involve matrix inversion. The matrix Lm,k,p(Ah)
has a sparse block structure, allowing it to be efficiently block encoded using an oracle query to A. Details
of the quantum circuit for encoding Lm,k,p(Ah) can be found in Sec. III C. By applying this block-encoding
in QLSA, we obtain the overall quantum algorithm for solving the linear ODEs.
The complexity analysis of the proposed quantum algorithm is conducted in detail. The core of the anal-
ysis focuses on deriving asymptotic upper bounds for the condition number of Lm,k,p(Ah). Unlike existing
