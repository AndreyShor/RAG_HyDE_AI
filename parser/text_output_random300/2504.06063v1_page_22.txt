FIG. 18.
Quark-connected contribution dΓ¯cs/dω2 to the
physical differential decay.
The black points correspond to
the sum of the three quark-connected contributions dΓ(p)
¯cs /dω2
that are also shown in different colors. The error-bars corre-
spond to the total error, i.e. to the sum in quadrature of the
statistical errors and of the HLT, FSE, a 7→0 and σ 7→0
systematic errors.
tained on a restricted set of the parameter’s space, our
first-principles non-perturbative lattice results show that
the weak-annihilation contribution is strongly suppressed
w.r.t. the quark-connected one. In fact, within the er-
rors that we quote on the dominating quark-connected
dΓ¯cs/dω2 contribution, the weak-annihilation contribu-
tion can be safely neglected.
In Figure 19, the analogous of Figure 7, we show the five
amputated correlators ˆY(i)
¯cs (t, ω2) extracted from both
the quark-connected (blue) and weak-annihilation (red)
contractions of the correlator Cµν
¯cs (tsnk, t, tsrc, ω2) at the
same value of the momentum8, |ω| = 0.10. As it can
be seen, although much more noisy than the quark-
connected ones, the weak-annihilation correlators pro-
vide statistically significant physical information and are
nicely consistent with the expected asymptotic behavior
at large times, i.e. with the fact that the lightest hadronic
state in this channel is the neutral pion (black solid line).
A similar plot can be shown for the other considered value
of the momentum, |ω| = 0.20.
8 The data presented in the previous subsection have been ob-
tained by using twisted boundary conditions [45] in order to cal-
culate the quark-connected correlators at the values of momenta
listed in Table II. This is not possible in the case of the weak-
annihilation correlators that have been evaluated at two values
of the momentum allowed by periodic boundary conditions. In
order to have a direct comparison of the fermion connected and
disconnected contributions, we have generated the blue data in
Figure 19 at the same values of the momenta used in the calcu-
lation of the weak annihilation diagram.

Ds while the intercept has been tuned in the differ-
ent panels to match the value of one of the red points. From
the nice agreement of the behavior of the weak-annihilation
correlators at large times with the corresponding black lines
we deduce that, as expected, the lightest hadronic state prop-
agating in this channel is the neutral pion that, instead, does
not appear in the fermion connected channel where we have
the heavier η¯ss meson.
In Figures 20 and 21 we compare the HLT stability anal-
yses of the quark-connected and weak-annihilation con-
tributions to dΓ(p)
¯cs (σ)/dω2, for the two considered values
of ω and for σmDs = 140 MeV in the case of the sigmoid
smearing kernel. As it can be seen, at both the considered
values of the momenta (that cover up to the middle of the
phase-space integration interval of the quark-connected
contribution, see Figure 18), the weak-annihilation con-
tribution is a factor O(10−3) smaller than the connected
one. Similar results can be shown for different values of
