Introduction
Modeling the intricacies of complex fluid flows is essential for applications in numerous
natural and industrial processes. Advancements in numerical and computational tech-
niques have transformed the study of fluid flows, enabling precise simulations of phenom-
ena ranging from laminar to turbulent regimes. However, achieving high-fidelity fluid flow
simulations using numerical methods, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), of-
ten incurs a substantial computational cost. Conventional CFD methodologies, such as
direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES), involve solving com-
plex problems with high-dimensional systems but are computationally expensive [1, 2, 3].
These methods often require substantial computational resources and extensive processing
times to generate high-dimensional data, making them a difficult option to employ for
many real-world applications.
To address these challenges, researchers have increasingly turned to machine learn-
ing (ML) techniques and reduced order models (ROMs), which have shown remarkable
success in learning complex patterns and temporal dynamics from data. ML algorithms,
particularly deep learning (DL) models with artificial neural networks (ANN), can process
vast amounts of data to identify underlying structures and predict future states. Convo-
lutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are
two prominent ML optimization architectures that have been adeptly employed in vari-
ous applications, including image recognition, time-series forecasting, and, more recently,
fluid dynamics. Each offers unique advantages that address the specific challenges inher-
ent in fluid flow prediction. LSTMs are effective in capturing long-term dependencies in
sequential data [4]. In fluid dynamics, LSTMs are utilized to capture and predict the
temporal evolution of flow patterns and dynamic behaviors over time. Their ability to
process sequential data makes them particularly effective for handling the temporal com-
plexities of fluid flows, such as those seen in turbulent wake dynamics or oscillatory jet
flows. CNNs are particularly effective for classification and image recognition tasks [5].
The strengths of CNNs in feature extraction and pattern recognition make them highly
suitable for applications in the field of fluid mechanics [6]. Using their capacity to identify
local patterns, such as vortices or boundary layer structures, CNNs provide an essential
tool for analyzing the spatial characteristics of fluid flows. For example, Guastoni et al.
[7] used CNNs to predict wall-bounded turbulence, achieving substantial improvements in
predictive accuracy over traditional methods. Drikakis and Sofos [8] explored how deep
neural networks can model turbulent flows, showcasing the ability to capture intricate
flow patterns that traditional methods may miss. Similarly, Vinuesa et al. [9] discussed
in their paper how ML techniques have been used to improve the modeling of turbulence
and the overall performance of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. They
highlighted that ML approaches can efficiently handle the complex, high-dimensional data
typical in fluid mechanics, providing significant advances in predictive accuracy and com-
