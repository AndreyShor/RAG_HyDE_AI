To evaluate the importance of the Euclidean normalization, we trained the model without this physics 
constraint. Figure VI provides a visual comparison of phase component distributions for the neural 
networks with and without Euclidean normalization, where the grey dashed circle indicates 𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝜑+
𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝜑= 1. Figure VI-a shows that a large number of predicted component values (orange dots) 
deviated from the unit circle. These deviations indicate physically impossible phase values that violate 
the mathematical constraint governing the cosine-sine relationship. These predictions could introduce 
artifacts in practical applications. In contrast, Figure VI-b displays the phase components from the 
physics-constrained model with Euclidean normalization. The predicted sine-cosine components are 
tightly constrained to the unit circle due to the Euclidean normalization layer. This embedded physical 
knowledge in the network architecture reduces the aspects the model must learn solely from data, 
and thus leads to better generalization with less data.

A key strength of this network is its ability to achieve accurate prediction while preserving physical 
interpretability. Unlike black-box models, the physics-constrained network ensures that the network’s 
predictions respect fundamental electromagnetic principles like energy conservation and periodic 
nature of phase. By incorporating physical constraints that narrow the solution space to physically 
meaningful predictions, the model effectively generalizes small, imbalanced datasets.

We have presented a physics-constrained neural network that effectively predicts the amplitude and 
phase of transmitted light from metasurface, demonstrating strong performance across datasets of
