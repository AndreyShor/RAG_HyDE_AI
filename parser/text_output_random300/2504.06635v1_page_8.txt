Generalized BPS Monopoles and Dyons
We consider a simple case where H = H0 with H0 is a real constant.
4.1
BPS monopoles α = 0
First, let us consider the case when α = 0 or Ei = 0, which corresponds to the BPS
monopole scenario.
In this case, from Eq.
(3.26), the BPS monopole solution can be
obtained if H0 = tan(γ) Consequently, the Bogomolny’s equations become
Ei = 0,
Bi = cos(γ)G DiΦ,
D0Φ = 0,
(4.1)
where the relation between the scalar dependent couplings is now Gw =
1
cos2(γ). These
equations are more general compared to the result in [17]. Here, unlike in [17], the constant
γ is still not ﬁxed to γ = 0 or π. The presence of θ-term modiﬁes the Bogomolny’s equations
and determines whether the solutions are BPS monopoles, with H0 = tan(γ), or are BPS
dyons, with H0 ̸= tan(γ).
4.2
BPS Dyons α ̸= 0
In this case a constant H0 ̸= tan(γ) and thus Bogomolny’s equations are given by
Ei = (sin(γ) −H0 cos(γ)) G
w DiΦ,
Bi = cos(γ)G DiΦ,
D0Φ = 0,
V = 0,
(4.2)
with
G =
w
w2 cos2(γ) + (sin(γ) −H0 cos(γ))2 .
(4.3)
If H0 = 0 then we get back the Bogomolny’s equations and relation between the couplings
as in [17].

Conclusions and Outlooks
We have shown using the most general BPS Lagrangian density (3.1) results in similar
Bogomolnyi’s equations as obtained in [13], by scaling α →α/w and β →β/w. However
our result is slightly diﬀerent. Here surprisingly we still have undetermined auxiliary ﬁelds
X3, X5, X6, and X7. Although it seems we can take any solution to these auxiliary ﬁelds,
there are some restrictions to these solutions in order for the Bogomolnyi’s equations to
be regular such as X5 ̸= G, X6 ̸= w, and X7 ̸= (X3−2H)2
4(X6−w) −w. One should notice that the
results in [13] correspond to taking X3 = X5 = X6 = X7 = 0 that do not violate those
restrictions. Nevertheless, we do not need to know explicit solutions to these auxiliary
ﬁelds since they are canceled out and do not show up explicitly at the end of computation.
We obtain similar Bogomolnyi’s equations (4.2) for the magnetic ﬁelds Bi, in terms of
G, as in [13]. This would imply the total energy of BPS dyon solutions of the Bogomol-
nyi’s equations (4.2) is proportional to the topological charge as shown in [13]. However
Bogomolnyi equations (4.2) for the electric ﬁelds Ei get a diﬀerent multiplication factor
