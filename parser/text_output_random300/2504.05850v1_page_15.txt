GRAPHICAL FUNCTIONS WITH SPIN
15
For s = 0 we have ˆzs = 0 and the term (85) is in an entry of the vector graphical function which has
j factors of ˆz2. We need to invert □λ+j, corresponding to dimension D + 2j, in this sector. Because
m + m > −(D + j) ≥−(D + 2j) the inversion is unique in the space of scalar graphical functions. We
do not need any adjustments at s = 0.
For s = 1 the situation is more complex: The term (85) populates (with alternating signs) a selection
of entries in the vector graphical function. One entry, e.g., is the coefficient of ˆzβ1
1 · · · ˆzβj
1
on which ∆λ
needs to be inverted. If −D ≥m + m > −D −j, the inversion is not unique in the space of scalar
graphical functions and therefore ambiguous.
The ambiguity comes from the kernel of the scalar Laplace operator □λ in integer dimensions (λ =
1, 2, . . .). With the notation of [2] (Equations (9) and (10)) we have
(90)
□λ =
1
(z −z)λ ∆λ−1(z −z)λ,
∆λ−1 = ∂z∂z + λ(λ −1)
(z −z)2 .
(For consistency with [2] we use the notation ∆λ−1 which must not be confused with the D-dimensional
Laplace operator ∆z2 that was used above.)
The kernel of □λ is hence (z −z)−λ times the kernel of ∆λ−1. The latter was determined in Theorem
33 of [2]. We conclude that
(91)
ker □λ = (z −z)−λ(dλg(z) + dλh(z)),
where g(z) and h(z) are arbitrary holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions, respectively. The differ-
ential operator dλ is given by (dλ is the complex conjugate of dλ)
(92)
dλ =
1
(z −z)λ−1
λ−1
X
k=0
(−1)k (λ + k −1)!
(λ −k −1)!k!(z −z)λ−k−1∂λ−k−1
z
.
We find that (z −z)−λdλ is homogeneous in z and z of degree −2λ + 1. Poles ((z −1)(z −1))−k come
from functions h(z) = (z −1)−2k+2λ−1 (and h(z) = −g(z) by symmetry). For a non-zero result we need
−2k + 2λ −1 < 0 (otherwise no pole is generated by dλ). We conclude that poles in ker □λ are of order
≥2λ. The smallest example is the function ((z −s)(z −s))−λ ∈ker □λ for all s ∈C.
It is proved in Theorem 5 of [2] that the maximum pole orders in 0 and 1 of a scalar graphical function
fG1(z) in Figure 1 is less than 2λ. (The stronger statement that the pole order is ≤2λ −2 uses the fact
that a scalar graphical function has even pole order which is not true for a graphical function with spin,
see Example 19.) Because the proof only uses scaling arguments (which are identical in the presence of
spin) it carries over to f α
G1(z). We thus search for a regular function F α
reg(z) in the pre-image of □α
λ which
inherits the constraints from the singularity structure of the graphical function f α
G1(z).
Assume we generate a term (85) in the kernel of □α
λ. The expression (85) has a component with j
factors ˆz2. The coefficient of this part must be in the kernel of □λ+j. This implies that −m−m ≥2λ+2j.
It follows that the pole order −m −m −j of (85) is ≥2λ + j ≥2λ.
Because the graphical function has pole order strictly less than 2λ we can kill the kernel which arises
from singularities at z = 1 by subtracting all poles of order ≥2λ.
It is necessary to regularize functions by subtracting poles in z = 1 at each step before the inversion of
□λ+j is applied in order to calculate F α
j . This way, the inversion is well-defined in terms of the algorithm
that appends an edge to a scalar graphical function in D + 2j dimensions. The result will behave well
on the singularities at 0 and ∞. The subtraction in the individual steps change the result only by pole
terms which are canceled in the end when all poles of order ≥2λ are subtracted. Therefore, we need no
compensation for these individual subtractions. This subtraction algorithm generalizes without changes
to the regular case in non-integer dimensions. See Example 21 for a detailed illustration.
Example 20. An explicit calculation gives for s = 0, 1,
□λ((z −s)(z −s))n = n(n + λ)((z −s)(z −s))n−1,
(93)
δ1((z −s)(z −s))n = −ns((z −s)(z −s))n−1.
We consider the function (88) in four dimensions (λ = 1). We use (81) for f2(z) = −f1(z) = ((z −
1)(z −1))−2 and obtain from (93)
□−1
2 f2(z) = −((z −1)(z −1))−1
δ1 □−1
2 f2(z) = −((z −1)(z −1))−2.
