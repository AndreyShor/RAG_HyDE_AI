Figure 4.8: Same as Fig. 4.4, now comparing our aN3LO result to those of Ref. [303] (MSHT20)
and Refs. [298, 299, 300] (FHMRUVV). In all cases the uncertainty band correspond to the IHOU as
estimated by the various groups. For the MSHT20 results, we display both the prior and the posterior
parametrizations (see text).
quark sector the MSHT20 prior has significantly larger IHOUs due to the fact that it does not
include the more recent information on Mellin moments from Refs. [293, 298, 299, 300, 301],
which were not available at the time of the MSHT20 analysis [303]. At the level of posterior,
however, significant differences appear also for Pgg, while persisting for Pgq. This means that
the gluon evolution at aN3LO is being modified by the data entering the global fit, and it is
not fully determined by the perturbative computation. Further benchmarks of aN3LO splitting
functions are presented in Ref. [19].
4.2. N3LO partonic cross-sections
A PDF determination at N3LO requires, in addition to the splitting functions discussed in
Section 4.1, hard cross-sections at the same perturbative order. Exact N3LO massless DIS
coefficient functions have been known for several years [62, 61, 64, 65, 66, 63], while
massive coefficient functions are only available in various approximations [78, 88, 79]. For
hadronic processes, N3LO results are available for inclusive Drell-Yan (DY) production for the
