2018), and non-thermal processes such as magnetic
fields (Cen 2024) and cosmic rays (CRs) (Su et al.
2021).
These feedback processes exhibit highly
nonlinear behavior and couple with other feedback
mechanisms, influencing jet and wind launching,
ISM/CGM interactions, turbulence generation, and
multiphase gas mixing.
The complexity arising from this diversity in
scales and physics poses significant challenges for
comprehensive modeling of AGN feedback, par-
ticularly in cosmological and zoom simulations
of galaxy formation and evolution.
Sub-grid
models typically address unresolved AGN feed-
back processes, including gas accretion onto the
SMBH, jet and wind launching, and feedback en-
ergy/momentum interactions with the ISM and
CGM. However, implementation approaches vary
substantially across different simulations (Vogels-
berger et al. 2014; Dubois et al. 2014; Crain et al.
2015; Weinberger et al. 2017; Dav´e et al. 2019;
Wellons et al. 2023; Hopkins et al. 2023). For in-
stance, IllustrisTNG incorporates a kinetic mode
at low accretion rates and a thermal mode at high
accretion rates (Weinberger et al. 2017), while EA-
GLE employs a thermal feedback model with fixed
efficiency (Crain et al. 2015). SIMBA combines
both kinetic and thermal feedback, emphasizing
kinetic feedback at low accretion rates (Dav´e et al.
2019). FIRE-3 implements a comprehensive model
including radiation, mechanical winds, and cosmic
rays (Wellons et al. 2023; Hopkins et al. 2023). De-
spite these variations in implementation, consensus
exists regarding AGN feedback’s role in suppress-
ing star formation and quenching massive galaxies
through gas heating or outflow-driven gas removal.
Despite extensive observational evidence of AGN
activity across various scales, the detailed physi-
cal processes of AGN feedback and its evolution-
ary impact remain incompletely understood. No-
tably, limited observational evidence supports in-
stantaneous, negative feedback effects from AGNs
(Shin et al. 2019). Some observations suggest pos-
itive AGN feedback, indicated by correlations be-
tween AGN luminosity and host galaxy star forma-
tion rates – an apparent contradiction to theoret-
ical expectations of AGN-induced star formation
quenching (Cresci et al. 2015). On the other hand,
some simulations indicate that AGN feedback may
locally enhance star formation through gas com-
pression (Gaibler et al. 2012; Mercedes-Feliz et al.
2023).
Overall, the integrated impacts of AGN
feedback on global star formation remains debated.
Addressing these challenges requires imple-
menting a comprehensive, multi-dimensional, and
multi-physics model capturing essential AGN feed-
back processes, particularly precise determination
of central SMBH accretion rates that govern the
AGN power and concrete AGN outputs.
Moti-
vated by this need, Yuan et al. (2018) developed
the Massive AGN Controlled Ellipticals Resolved
(MACER, hereafter MACER2D) project - a two-
dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic frame-
work studying the evolution of elliptical galax-
ies with the effects of AGN feedback included.
MACER2D has several key features. It focuses on
galactic rather than cosmological scales thus it has
achieved very high spatial resolution. In fact, the
Bondi radius, which is the outer boundary of the ac-
cretion flow of the central AGN, is well resolved. In
this case, the mass flux within the Bondi radius can
be accurately calculated. Combined with the black
hole accretion theory, the mass accretion rate at the
black hole horizon and the accordingly computed
AGN outputs can be obtained, including the AGN
power and properties of radiation, jet, and wind.
These quantities are crucial for the study of AGN
feedback. Moreover, the interaction between these
outputs and ISM is calculated rather than parame-
terized as in almost all cosmological simulations.
Admittedly, we note that the model is still idealized
and misses the proper cosmological context, which
is discussed in more detail in the caveat of the con-
clusions. In addition, although the mass accretion
rate can be obtained more reliably than in cosmo-
logical simulations, the effects of the feedback are
still parameterized in a subgrid fashion based on
