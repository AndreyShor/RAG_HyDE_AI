In the case n = 3/2, we have ̺2T 2
2 ≪M2. Additionally, log(T2/T3)/(T2/T3) < 1 since
T2 > T3. We conclude that the induced magnetic ﬁeld also reaches its maximum when
n = 1, namely ̺T > λM. So we will focus on the case n = 1, where the induced magnetic
ﬁeld is

which is only marginally acceptable even if we adopt an extreme parameter set v = Mp and
T3 = Ta. We conclude that our formalism cannot generate enough cosmic magnetic ﬁeld
before the e+e−annihilation epoch. Nonetheless, it’s inspiring to see that we’re quite close
to a sizable seed magnetic ﬁelds. Naturally, we would expect that after the annihilation
epoch, the electric conductivity drops about ten orders of magnitude, and accordingly the
induced magnetic ﬁeld could be ten orders larger. Intuitively, suﬃcient magnetic ﬁeld can
be generated if the magnetogenesis happens after the annihilation epoch. We will verify
this assertion in the next section.

Magnetogenesis after the annihilation epoch

Magnetic ﬁeld generated during the tachyonic phase
The magnetic ﬁeld generated after the annihilation epoch can be evaluated in a same way.
We also start with the magnetogenesis during the tachyonic phase, where

We shall also express the magnetic ﬁeld in terms of r. After a quick examination we ﬁnd
