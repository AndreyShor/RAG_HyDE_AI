feedback structures are more clearly visible from this perspective, revealing high-velocity (> 104 km/s) cold winds in
bi-conical regions during cold-mode AGN feedback, with prominent shock fronts at the wind-ISM interface.
the feedback. At ùë°= 67 Myr, the transition from
cold to hot mode feedback is evident: low-density
bi-conical regions carved by previous cold winds
persist while nascent hot winds begin launching.
These observations demonstrate the complex, dy-
namic impact of AGN feedback on intermediate-
scale gas properties, which plays a crucial role in
regulating both gas dynamics and star formation of
the galaxy.
3.4. Cross-model comparison: temporal
evolution of AGN activity and star formation
To investigate the relative impacts of AGN and
SN feedback on galaxy evolution, we analyze the
temporal evolution of AGN luminosity ùêøBH and
specific star formation rate (sSFR) across our three
simulation models (Fig. 6). Each model exhibits
distinctly different evolutionary patterns, highlight-
ing the complex interplay between these feedback
mechanisms.
In the fiducial simulation, which incorporates
both feedback channels, AGN luminosity and sSFR
demonstrate strong temporal correlation. The evo-
lution is characterized by episodic bursts of activity
persisting for ‚àºMyr with characteristic intervals of
several hundred Myr. This behavior suggests co-
ordinated regulation of both black hole accretion
and star formation through the combined effects of
AGN and SN feedback.
The noSNfb simulation exhibits markedly differ-
ent behavior, with both quantities showing rapid
variability on ‚àºMyr timescales.
The burst du-
ration and intervals are substantially compressed
compared to the fiducial model.
This pat-
tern closely resembles the AGN luminosity evolu-
tion observed in previous MACER2D simulations
where SN feedback was spatially smoothed, indi-
cating that spatially-resolved SN feedback plays a
crucial role in modulating AGN activity. The un-
derlying mechanism likely involves SN feedback‚Äôs
influence on small-scale cold gas accretion dynam-
ics, though detailed investigation of this process is
deferred to future work.
