Figure 13: Comparison of the predicted temporal evolution of streamwise velocity com-

ground truth. The differences between HOSVD and SVD are minimal, with both methods
achieving a high degree of temporal accuracy across all architectures.
In terms of the LSTM architectures themselves, all three configurationsâ€”1 dense, 2
dense, and time-distributed perform robustly, demonstrating their ability to accurately
capture the flow dynamics when paired with robust dimensionality reduction techniques.
The results emphasize that even relatively simple architectures, when optimized with ap-
propriate hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and sequence length, can
achieve competitive results. This finding highlights the importance of proper parameter
selection and demonstrates that increasing model complexity does not always yield sig-
nificant improvements, especially when a simpler network can already provide sufficient
predictive accuracy.
