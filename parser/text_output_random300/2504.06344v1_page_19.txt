tuned) are shown on Figure 1 and Figure 3, for Q = −1

In order to further corroborate our findings, we also study the moduli space of these
constant-F solutions and show that the lattice minimum action configurations generated
from random initial conditions cover the entire moduli space (subject to the limitation that
we only generate a finite number of configurations).
We begin with k = r = 1, where there are only 4 moduli, the holonomies ϕC′=1

any solution with Q = 1/N, these moduli correspond to translations of the solution on T4.
The action density is independent of the moduli, but the winding Wilson loops depend on
them. A Wilson loop winding in xµ only depends on ϕ1
µ, as is clear from the explicit form
of the constant-F solutions (2.7, 2.8) and the relation (2.10). The Wilson loops, as functions
of ϕ1
µ (for fixed xµ) were studied in detail in [27] and were an important tool in figuring out
the shape and size of the moduli space. As the modulus ϕ1
µ, is varied, the Wilson loop in
