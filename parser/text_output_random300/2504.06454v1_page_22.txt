the orbital-limited upper critical ﬁeld. The calculated µ0Horb
c2
values, obtained from
magnetization measurements, are 17.9, 20.4, 17.0, 15.4, and 15.3 T, corresponding to
the as-cast, 400 ◦C, 600 ◦C, 800 ◦C, and 1000 ◦C samples, respectively. Similarly,
resistivity measurements yield values of 17.9, 21.5, 17.0, 15.4, and 15.3 T for the same
samples. These results indicate that µ0Horb
c2
is enhanced at lower annealing temper-
atures, with larger lattice strain correlating with elevated µ0Horb
c2 . The pronounced
lattice strain is associated with the ﬁne eutectic microstructure, which involves sig-
niﬁcant structural mismatches at the bcc–hcp phase interfaces. This combination of
lattice strain and structural mismatch strengthens ﬂux pinning, consistent with the
results of the Jc values discussed below. Strong ﬂux pinning mitigates Cooper pair
destruction caused by Lorentz forces, thereby enhancing µ0Horb
c2 .

The results of the isothermal magnetic hysteresis loops at 2 K and 4.2 K are sum-
marized in Figs. 20(a)-(e) for all samples. The hysteresis loops of samples annealed
at higher temperatures exhibit smaller areas compared to their as-cast and 400 ◦C
annealed counterparts. For the as-cast, 400 ◦C, and 600 ◦C annealed samples at 2 K,
abrupt changes in M occur at low ﬁelds, as shown in Fig. 20(a), (b), and (c), respec-
tively. In contrast, no such abrupt variations in M are discernible at 4.2 K in the same
ﬁgures. This behavior is attributed to the ﬂux jump phenomenon commonly observed
in various superconductors, including the aforementioned HEAs[49, 54]. Figures 21(a)
