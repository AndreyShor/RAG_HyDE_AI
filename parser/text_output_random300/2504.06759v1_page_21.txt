Low-energy local density of states. The low-energy electronic density of
states on the blue sublattice in layer J in the vicinity of the valley q for the a. AB|AB →AB|BC →
AB|CA →AB|AB sliding junction, and the b. AB|AC →AB|BA →AB|CB →AB|AC sliding junction.
Note that the AB|AC and AB|CB crystals are physically equivalent.
