Notably, many electronic health records (EHRs) are limited in their ability to capture full 
SDOH data for all patients. Ideally, data fields from standardized sources such as the PhenX 
Toolkit19,20 would be incorporated into EHRs and collected from all patients, but this is a difficult 
task to enact across health systems, especially retroactively. Recent work has reported that standard 
EHR demographic data of race, ethnicity, sex, age, and median annual income in census tracts 
correlate to dyads, triads, and tetrads of SDOH (food insecurity, social isolation, daily stress, and 
housing and utilities),7 resulting in ‘SDOH phenotype demographic correlates.’ Including the latter 
broadens the types and amount of data that can be studied by HD researchers. For simplicity, here 
we group together SDOH phenotypes and SDOH phenotype demographic correlates under the 
term ‘SDOH-related phenotypes.’  
Detecting SDOH-related phenotypes using alternative data sources, such as medical images, 
may also enhance research and development of services to address HDs. ‘Big data’ computational 
methods can yield, at scale via high-throughput means, computer-extracted radiomic features of 
medical images (termed radiomic phenotypes) across multiple large groups (i.e., thousands to 
millions of individuals) due to high-throughput segmentation and feature extraction algorithms. In 
addition to traditional radiomic features, which are human-engineered mathematical descriptors of 
medical images or image findings, features directly extracted from images using deep learning 
networks can also serve as ‘surrogate’ imaging-based features. In this work, for simplicity, we 
refer to any feature extraction from a medical image as a ‘radiomic feature.’ Radiomic features 
have been extensively studied, leading to robust, generalizable feature extraction methods for 
multiple 
purposes.21–23
