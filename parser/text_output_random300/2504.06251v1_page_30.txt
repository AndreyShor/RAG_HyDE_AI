Extended Data Fig. 6 | Comparison of electronic structure between non-aligned R5G/BN
sample S2 and S3. a, Dispersion image measured along Γ-K direction on sample S2. b, Same
image as a with calculated results appended as red dotted curves. c, Dispersion image measured
along Γ-K direction on sample S3. d, Same image as c with calculated results appended as red
dotted curves.
Extended Data Fig. 7 | Momentum range of the flat band in non-aligned R5G/BN. a, Ex-
perimental Fermi surface map on the non-aligned R5G/BN (sample S3). The red circle indicates
the flat band with a diameter of 0.10 ± 0.02 ˚A
−1. b-e, Experimental dispersion images measured
along directions indicated by short lines in a.
