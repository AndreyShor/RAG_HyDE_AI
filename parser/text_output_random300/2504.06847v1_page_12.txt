3.3. Vibrational spectra 
 
The vibrational spectra of 2-AmpH2PO3, both polymorphs of 2-AmpHSO4 and (2-
Amp)2SO4H2O, are depicted in Figs. 7-11. The assignment of the observed bands (see Tables 
2-5) is based on the quantum-chemical calculation concerning 2-Amp(1+) cation (see Table 
S12, Supplementary material), the detailed analysis of 2-AmpCl¬ΩH2O spectrum (see Table 
S13 and Fig. S9, Supplementary material) and the literature concerning vibrational 
manifestation of the involved inorganic anions [54-58]. Following the previously published 
assignment of vibrational spectra of the 2-Amp molecule [20], the formation of the 2-Amp(1+) 
cation in solution was studied using Raman spectroscopy ‚Äì see Fig. S10, Supplementary 
material. The obtained experimental results are consistent with quantum-chemical calculation 
and last but not least, the confirmation of the formation of the 2-Amp(1+) cation is also 
provided by the results of the X-ray structural analysis of 2-AmpCl¬ΩH2O, which crystallized 
as the only product from the studied equimolar aqueous solution of 2-Amp and hydrochloric 
acid. 
 
The assignment of the bands of stretching vibrations of N-H and O-H groups involved in 
hydrogen bonds is based on correlation curves [59, 60] concerning the position of the 
vibrational bands and appropriate hydrogen bond lengths. In the case of 2-AmpH2PO3, the 
results of solid-state DFT computations for the vibrational spectra assignment were also used - 
see Chapter 3.5. 
 The number of expected normal modes of the title crystals was determined by the nuclear site 
group analysis [61]. The crystals of 2-AmpH2PO3 belong to the space group P21 (ùê∂2
2, No. 4) 
with 19 atoms (Z=2) per asymmetric unit, which form one 2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) cation 
and one hydrogen phosphite anion. All atoms occupy two-fold Wyckoff positions a(C1). The 
polymorphs of 2-AmpHSO4 (I) and 2-AmpHSO4 (II) belong to the space group P21/c (ùê∂2‚Ñé
5 , 
No. 14).  The asymmetric units with 19 atoms (Z=4) are formed by one 2-
aminopyrimidinium(1+) cation and one hydrogen sulfate anion.  All atoms occupy four-fold 
Wyckoff positions e(C1). The crystals of (2-Amp)2SO4H2O belong to the space group P21/n 
(ùê∂2‚Ñé
5 , No. 14, cell choice 2) with 34 atoms (Z=4) per asymmetric unit, which form two 2-
aminopyrimidinium(1+) cations, one sulfate anion and one water molecule. All atoms occupy 
four-fold Wyckoff positions e(C1).
