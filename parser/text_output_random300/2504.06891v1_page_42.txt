The inverse Bremsstrahlung (free-free) absorption cross-section is computed following the ap-
proaches of Hummer122 and van Hoof123. The thermal averages are performed numerically, and
the resulting values are then ﬁtted by a two-dimensional Chebyshev expansion in temperature
and photon energy, both in a logarithmic scale. The included line-broadening mechanisms com-
prise inelastic collisions in the impact approximation, the Stark effect from neighboring ions in
the quasi-static approximation, the Doppler effect, and the natural line width. The elastic con-
tribution from electron collisions is neglected because it is much smaller than the inelastic one.
The Doppler effect is modeled using a Gaussian proﬁle, while inelastic collisions with electrons
are described by a Lorentzian proﬁle. Except for speciﬁc lines of one- and two-electron atoms
(as discussed below), the ionic Stark effect is modeled by a Gaussian proﬁle. The corresponding
half-widths at half maximum (HWHM) are denoted by γDoppler, γcoll, γStark and γnat, respectively.
The convolution of the Gaussian and Lorentzian proﬁles leads to a Voigt proﬁle:

Inelastic electron collisions
The electron collisions are described following Dimitrijevi´c and Konjevi´c125;126;127, which relies
on Baranger’s expression for the width of an isolated line128;129:
