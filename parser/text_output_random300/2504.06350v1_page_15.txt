√
2 −2 ≃0.82 [153]. This comes from Eq. (26) for ηA = ηB, independent on the
measurement nor on each other. Then ⟨MA|0⟩= 0 = ⟨NB|0⟩because the results will be uncorrelated (the
detected particle is in a maximally mixed state). It follows a list of less recent achievements: (i) The CDE
is lowered to 2/3 ≃0.66 [154], which comes at the cost of very low robustness to background noise as the
state is almost separable (see fig. 7b). (ii) For more general scenarios, involving more measurements, the
extra-outcome approach presents lower CDEs [147]. (iii) Overall, if ρ ∈B(Nn
i=1 Cd) is used, then higher d
and/or n implies lower (exponentially) CDE [155], but at the costs of more experimental complexity. For
example, an improvement for CHSH is only for d ≳1600. In asymmetric (symmetric) Bell tests η∗∼1

(η∗∼61.8%) [156]. (iv) For the BI I3322, with one ideal detection efficiency (ηA = 1), a CDE is ηB = 43%
(or ηB = 66.7%) for non-maximally (or maximally) entangled states [157]; (v) an LHV model cannot
describe p ∈Q when the number of measurement settings at each site mA and mB satisfy [158, 159]

Below more recent achievements: (i) a family of n-party BI with binary outcomes and m > 2 measurement
settings per party can obtain BI violation with lower CDE [160]; (ii) BI using multiple copies of the two-
qubit maximally entangled state and Pauli measurements, defining a Bell setup with m = 2n settings and
2n outcomes reduces the CDE below 0.8214 for n ≥2 [161]; (iii) An exponential reduction of CDE was
demonstrated in [162] by violating N BI in parallel using N entangled states shared by a single particle
pair. (iv) the BI I4
4422 is experimentally violated using four-dimensional entangled photons closing the
detection loophole with η ∼71.7% [163]10. (v) to experimentally increase detection efficiency (qubits
constructed in trapped ions, atoms, or nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond) is also used an “event-
ready” setup, in which the presence of particles at the measurement stations is heralded by an additional
event-ready protocol [164–166] (more detail in Sec. 6.3.2). In point-to-point photonic experiments, both
link losses and detector losses are more difficult to overcome. Superconducting single-photon detectors
(SNSPDs), achieving efficiencies of over 90%, have been instrumental in recent loophole-free experiments
[167–169].
Fair sampling loophole. – The losses that naturally appear (e.g., in optical fibers) and affect the particles
independently of the measurement settings, are solely responsible for |D| ≪|E|.
The fair sampling
assumption (FSA) is often invoked to justify ignoring the detection loophole.
Definition 5. A Bell tests in which |D| ≪|E invoked FSA when it imposes that p(D) ≃p(E).
Eve can exploit the fair sampling loophole by applying a biased coarse-graining µDL to the distribution
p(E), resulting in p(D) = µDL[p(E)] ̸= p(E). This manipulation skews the observed data p, making it
falsely appear that p ∈Q \ L, as if BI were violated. She can achieve this by influencing detection
efficiency, introducing selective transmission losses, or tampering with data processing. For instance, Eve
may ensure that only particles with hidden variables producing strong correlations are detected, while
others are discarded.
Proposition 2. Although high-efficiency detectors, with |D|/|E| ≃1, limit Eve’s manipulation, they do
not guarantee p(D) ≃p(E).
Even in experiments with η ∼1, hidden mechanisms can bias which particles are detected based on certain
hidden variables (e.g., emission angle or polarization). These variables could correlate with measurement
settings in a way that skews the detected sample to favour results violating BI. Thus, while nearly all
particles are detected (addressing the detection loophole), the sample may still not represent the full
emitted set (leaving the fair sampling loophole open). To avoid such bias, careful calibration is crucial
like using space-like separation and random detector calibration [170]. However, η ∼1 [171] makes it
easier to verify that the detected pairs are a fair representation of the emitted set, helping to close the
fair sampling loophole, e.g. in Ref. [171]11.
10In an atom-photon system for example, the atomic system can have ηA, ηB near the unity (see Sec. 6).
11Despite the detection loophole in Ref. [171] is closed, but the separation distance was not sufficient to close the locality
loophole.
