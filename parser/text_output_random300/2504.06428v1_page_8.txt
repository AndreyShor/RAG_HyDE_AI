⃗Q and ⃗P are in fact logarithmic coordinates of ⃗q ≡e ⃗
Q and ⃗p ≡e ⃗P respectively with a (randomly) chosen branch.
Each element in ⃗Q and ⃗P is a complex variable and they satisfy the Poisson brackets
{QI, PJ} = δIJ ,
∀I, J = 1, · · · , 15 .

(Ma, Pa) is a pair of holomorphic (logarithmic) Fock-Gontrarov (FG) coordinates associated to the 4-holed sphere
Sa (a = 1, · · · , 5), and (2Lab, Tab) is a pair of holomorphic (logarithmic) Fenchel-Nielsen (FN) coordinates associated
to the annulus (ab) connecting Sa and Sb. The position variable 2Lab is called the FN length, and its conjugate
momentum Tab is called the FN twist.
Another way to decompose ∂(S3\Γ5) is induced by the so-called ideal triangulation, denoted as T(S3\Γ5), of S3\Γ5,
on which the Chern-Simons partition function is well-known [21, 22]. The ideal triangulation of S3\Γ5, as illustrated
in fig.4 is composed of 5 ideal octahedra denoted as Oct(i) (i = 1, · · · , 5), each of which is further composed of 4 ideal
tetrahedra denoted as ∆xi, ∆yi, ∆zi, ∆wi with one internal edge. An ideal tetrahedron and an ideal octahedron are
illustrated in fig.5.
In an ideal tetrahedron ∆, each of its 6 edges are associated with holomorphic FG coordinates

FIG. 4: The decomposition of the ideal triangulation T(S3\Γ5) of S3\Γ5 into 5 ideal octahedra (in red).
Numbers ¯1, ¯2, ¯3, ¯4, ¯5 with bars denote the 4-holed spheres on ∂(S3\Γ3). In each ideal octahedron Oct(i),
x, y, z, w (labelled in red) are chosen to form the equator of the octahedron.
from the set {z, z′, z′′} in the way as in fig.5a as well as anti-holomorphic FG coordinates from the set {˜z, ˜z′, ˜z′′} in
the same way. These coordinates satisfy
zz′z′′ = −1,
˜z˜z′˜z′′ = −1
(27)
which eliminates one of the coordinates from each set, say z′ and ˜z′. Then (z, z′′) (resp. (˜z, ˜z′′)) is a pair of holomorphic
(resp. anti-holomorphic) symplectic coordinates of the Chern-Simons phase space P∂∆= Mflat(∂∆, SL(2, C)) on the
boundary ∂∆of ∆. The logarithmic variables Z = ln z, Z′′ = ln z′′, eZ = ln ˜z, eZ′′ = ln ˜z′′ satisfy the Poisson brackets
{Z, Z′′} = { eZ, eZ′′} = 1 ,
{Z, eZ} = {Z, eZ′′} = {Z′′, eZ} = {Z′′, eZ′′} = 0 .
