2.3 SPAD-DCS system and noise calculation 
As reported earlier20, the SPAD sensor ATLAS, with embedded on-chip autocorrelation 
computation optimized for DCS applications, has demonstrated deep and high-speed CBF 
monitoring. In this work, we operated ATLAS in the ensemble DCS mode, where all 128×128 
macropixels (each composed of 4×4 micropixels) were combined and averaged to output 31 lag 
times of the light intensity ACF. The pixel clock (PixClk) was set to 25 MHz, corresponding to a 
lag time range of 1.28–39.68 µs, enabling deeper/faster flow information capture. The iteration 
number was set to 4096, corresponding to an integration time of 5.24 ms. We used a continuous-
wave laser source (DL785-100-S, 785 nm, 100 mW, CrystaLaser) coupled with a multimode 
optical fiber (MMF, M143L01, Ø600 µm, 0.22 NA, Thorlabs) to illuminate tissues. The detector 
fiber (MMF, M59L01, Ø1000 µm, 0.50 NA, Thorlabs) tip was placed 23 mm from the SPAD chip, 
the optimal distance for maximizing speckle contrast20. Both fibers were held by a custom 3D-
printed probe, maintaining a 35 mm separation. The overall system setup is illustrated in Fig. 1. 
We processed SPAD ACF data using single-exponential fitting, a simplified model commonly 
preferred for real-time measurements. The analytical normalized light intensity ACF can be 
simplified to a single-exponential decay function at a small 𝜏𝜏 range44,45: 
𝑔𝑔2(𝜏𝜏) = 1 + 𝛽𝛽𝑒𝑒−2𝜏𝜏/𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐,
(7) 
where 𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 is the decorrelation time. The reciprocal of 𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐, known as the decorrelation speed, is 
directly proportional to blood flow rate and can be used to quantify blood flow changes13. In the 
following sections, we compare cerebral perfusion measured by DL and fitting methods through 
comparing rCBFi measured with the DL model and the relative change in single-exponential 
fitting-recovered decorrelation speed. 
 
Fig. 1 The SPAD-DCS system setup. The 785 nm continuous wave laser was coupled into a multi-mode fiber 
(MMF, M143L01, Ø600 µm, 0.22 NA, Thorlabs), the scattered photons was collected by another MMF (M59L01, 
Ø1000 µm, 0.50 NA, Thorlabs). The output of the SPAD array was received by an Opal Kelly FPGA board 
(XEM7310-A200) and transferred to the PC through a USB 3.0 cable. The on-chip computed ACF is sent to the 
trained DL model for real-time CBFi/rCBFi display. 
We applied this system to a healthy human adult (male, 29 years old) at the resting-state to collect 
the baseline autocorrelation. The probe was secured to the participant’s forehead using an 
adjustable Velcro strap to ensure stability and comfort. The test was repeated five times, recording 
1000 ACF frames per session, yielding a total of 5,000 baseline samples for noise estimation. We 
use 𝑋𝑋(𝜏𝜏) to represent the collected data. To prevent overestimation of noise due to pulsatile CBF
