data-driven decision-making [4][5] [6], stands to benefit significantly from enhanced data repre-
sentations offered by quantum encoding techniques [7]. Beyond discrete methods, continuous
variable encoding strategies such as Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) encoding, Dis-
placement embedding, sqeezing embedding provide greater expressibility and richer feature map-
pings, potentially improving model performance in ways not achievable with classical approaches
[8] [9] [10] . These methods introduce structured transformations in the quantum Hilbert space,
enabling new forms of feature representation that could refine classical machine learning models.
However, the impact of these encoding strategies on machine learning performance, as well as
their computational trade-offs, remains an open research question.
This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting a comparative analysis of advanced quan-
tum encoding methods and their influence on classical machine learning models. Unlike previous
works that primarily examined conventional encoding techniques, we expand the scope to include
next-generation quantum embeddings. Through rigorous experimentation across multiple ma-
chine learning algorithms—including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest
Neighbors, and ensemble methods such as Random Forest and LightGBM—we evaluate the
extent to which these encodings enhance classification accuracy, F1 scores, and overall model
efficiency. Additionally, we investigate the computational costs associated with each encoding
method, providing insights into their practical feasibility for real-world applications.
By systematically exploring these advanced quantum encoding strategies, this research con-
tributes to the growing body of knowledge at the intersection of quantum computing and clas-
sical machine learning. Our findings offer valuable perspectives for researchers and practitioners
seeking to harness quantum-inspired techniques for improved data analysis and predictive mod-
eling. Furthermore, this study sheds light on the scalability and potential adoption of quantum
encoding approaches in hybrid classical-quantum computational frameworks, paving the way for
future advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning.

Quantum Computing
Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in information processing, leveraging funda-
mental principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations that are infeasible for classical
systems. Unlike classical bits, which exist in discrete states of 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can
exist in a superposition of states, enabling simultaneous evaluation of multiple computational
paths [11] [12]. This inherent parallelism holds significant implications for enhancing machine
learning models, particularly in tasks involving high-dimensional data representations.
Continuous-Variable Quantum Computing (CVQC) and Discrete-Variable Quantum Comput-
ing (DVQC) are two prominent paradigms in quantum computing [13]. While DVQC typically
uses qubits to represent information in binary states (0 or 1), CVQC encodes information in
continuous variables, such as the amplitude and phase of light [14] [15] [16]. CVQC leverages
quantum states of light, such as squeezed states and Gaussian states, to perform computations
[17]. This continuous nature allows CVQC to efficiently handle certain types of data, particularly
those involving real-valued inputs, which are common in machine learning applications.
Entanglement, another cornerstone of quantum mechanics, establishes strong correlations be-
tween qubits regardless of spatial separation, facilitating more complex and efficient informa-
tion encoding [18]. This property is particularly relevant for advanced quantum data encoding
techniques, as it allows for richer feature mappings and interdependencies that classical repre-
