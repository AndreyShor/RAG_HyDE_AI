Figure 6: Mass fraction under the KP formalism as a function of the variance of the density perturbations

The numerical solution of (A.1) is shown in Fig. 6 as the continuous black curve labeled
βnum and as a function of the variance of the density perturbations σk. Also shown in
Fig. 6 is the analytical approximation β(k) ≃0.056σ5
k for small σk as the red dashed curve
labeled βold. One can observe that for σk ≳10−2, this analytical estimation deviates from
the numerical solution, with one order of magnitude of deviation for σk ∼O(1). Since in
this work, we study amplified perturbations, we find it useful to find a parametrization of
the numerical solution valid also for high values of σk. This new parametrization is shown
in Fig. 6 as the green dashed curve labeled as βnew, which fits better than βold. It is given
by
βnew(k) =

which asymptotes to the old estimation βold for small σk, and to the constant value A2/A3
for high σk. This last can be understood from the fact that strong anisotropy suppresses
