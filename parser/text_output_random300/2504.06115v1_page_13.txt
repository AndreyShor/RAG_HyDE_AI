The physical derivation of this modiﬁcation rests on the claim that the eﬀective super-
gravity associated to the M-theory compactiﬁcation on X exhibits a
G5d = Hom

H2( b

gauge symmetry and the ﬁve dimensional BPS-particles carry charges
(d, [p]N) ∈H2( b
X, Z) = Z × ZN .
(3.4)
As has been pointed out in [16], the relation of the homology groups under conifold transitions,
that we use to construct the geometries Xa for a = 1, . . . , 4, directly translates to a physics
proof of (3.3).
The original argument from [17, 18] then carries over with the only modiﬁcation being
that the invariants carry an additional label that keeps track of the torsion charge.
We
refer to [14–16] for more details, also on the mathematical deﬁnition of the torsion reﬁned
invariants.
It was pointed out in [14] that the topological string partition function does not distin-
guish the choices [k]N and [−k]N for α. This is related to the phenomenon, further discussed
in [15, 16], that M-theory on X appears to “see” all of the small resolutions simultaneously.
This has already been observed for the non-compact conifold in [53]. It is useful to keep this
in mind since it will also explain several factors of two that appear later on in our discussion.
3.2
The B-model at genus zero
Let us now assume that the Calabi-Yau background (X, [k]N) is mirror to a Calabi-Yau
background (Wk, βk), where Wk is a projective Calabi-Yau threefold and βk represents the
B-ﬁeld topology on Wk and takes values in some suitable group. The question of whether
or not Wk is smooth and whether βk is non-trivial are of course very interesting but we will
assume that this does not aﬀect the calculation of the periods. 11 We will therefore forget
about βk and will sometimes just talk about Wk as the mirror of (X, [k]N).
The K¨ahler potential that is associated to the special K¨ahler structure on the complex
structure moduli space Mcs of Wk takes the form
e−K(z,¯z) = i
Z
Wk
Ω∧¯Ω,
(3.5)
in terms of the holomorphic 3-form Ω, which is a section of the K¨ahler line bundle L. A
rescaling Ω→ef(z)Ω, in terms of a holomorphic function f(z) on Mcs, therefore corresponds
to a K¨ahler transformation
K(z, ¯z) →K(z, ¯z) −f(z) −¯f(¯z) .
(3.6)
11There is certainly a lot to be understood here, for example what happens if the B-ﬁeld topology on Wk
obstructs certain deformations.
This is beyond the scope of our paper but we hope to come back to this
question in future work.
