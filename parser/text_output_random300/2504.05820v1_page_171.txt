NNLO polarized PDFs with MHOU
157
The second term in Eq. (5.6), ΛintRint(θ), is a regularization term that enforces the lowest
moments of polarized PDFs to be finite. This requirement follows from the assumption that the
nucleon matrix element of the axial current is finite for each parton. Therefore, the small-x
behavior of polarized PDFs must obey
lim
x→0 x∆f(x, Q2) = 0
for f = g, Σ, T3, T8 ,
(5.9)
lim
x→0 x2∆f(x, Q2) = 0
for f = V3, V8 .
(5.10)
The first of these two conditions is fulfilled by construction for the polarized quark triplet and
octet PDF combinations, given the choice of normalization made in their parametrization, see
Eq. (5.4). The regularization term is therefore

where Q2
int = 1 GeV2 and xint = 10−5. The Lagrange multiplier Λint grows exponentially during
the fit and reaches the maximum value Λint = 100 at maximum training length.
The third term in Eq. (5.6), ΛposR(k)
pos(θ), is enforces PDFs to lead to positive cross-sections. This
implies that polarized PDFs are bound by their unpolarized counterparts for each parton f, for
each x, and for each Q2 [366]
|∆f(x, Q2)| ≤f(x, Q2) .
(5.13)
Whereas Eq. (5.13) is formally valid only at LO, it can be suitably used to enforce positivity
bounds on polarized PDFs at all orders. This is justified by the following observation: NLO
corrections to the positivity bounds only differ from its lowest order by an amount less than 10%
in the small-x regions (x ∼10−2) while the positivity bounds in Eq. (5.13) is only significant at
large-x, as for e.g. g1/F1 ∼x as x →0. Higher-order corrections to the positivity bounds are
negligible in comparison to the size of the PDF uncertainties in regions where they are found to
provide no constraints. The positivity regularization term is
