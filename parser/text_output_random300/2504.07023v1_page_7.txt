Figure 3. Maximal possible final fidelity F for the system of three fermions as a function of
the total protocol time T in the case of three different experimental limitations on external
strength g and for two different target interactions g2. The lowest bound of the fidelity is
presented by the bottom horizontal dashed line. The vertical dashed red line indicates the
estimated quantum speed limit time TQSL for obtaining fidelity on the level of 99.9% and 99%
(respectively for g2 = 1 and g2 = 2) indicated by an upper horizontal dashed line. In all plots,
time is measured in natural time-unit of harmonic oscillator 1/ω.
parameter g(t) is dimensionless. In the following, we focus on the experimentally relevant
scenario of mA/mB = 40/6 corresponding to the 40K-6Li mixture. However, all the results
can be straightforwardly generalized to other desired mass ratios similarly.
Properties of different systems described with generic Hamiltonian (5) are deeply
studied in many different contexts [29, 30, 31].
It is known that it can be relatively
easily diagonalized numerically for any interaction strength g. In our approach, we use
straightforward diagonalization in the Fock basis spanned by a set of the lowest single-
particle orbitals of the harmonic oscillator cut on some, sufficiently large excitation C. The
cut-off is determined operationally by checking the convergence of the final results after
a further increase of the basis.
We find that all our results presented in the following
are well-converged if the cut-off is C = 14. With our method, we are able to determine
numerically the lowest eigenstates of the Hamiltonian |Ψi(g)⟩and their eigenenergies E(g).
It is also possible to perform time propagation of any state |Ψ(t)⟩via the Runge-Kutta
method, provided that during the evolution one can neglect couplings to cut off Fock states.
Let us assume that initially the system is prepared in the non-interacting ground state of
