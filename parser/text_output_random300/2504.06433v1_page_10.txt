for constants Cs, Du ∈C.
We choose A, B such that for the assignment a = a(A, B), all the polynomials P (1)
s
(xs)
and P (2)
u (zu) are nonconstant and P(a) = 0. By Eqs. (4,5), we must have
T1, T2 ̸= 0,
T2 ̸= αd1,
T1 ̸= αc1.
By Eq. (2), this excludes two values for each of A and B.
Setting P(a) = 0 and using Eqs. (2,3), we get
(c1 + cs0A) (d1 + du0B) = αc1d1.
(6)
Now observe that for any A such that T1 = c1 + cs0A ̸= 0, there is a unique B that fulﬁlls (6),
namely
B =
αc1d1
du0(c1 + cs0A) −d1
du0
.
(7)
Moreover the mapping of A to solution B is injective. Recall that we have to avoid two values for
each of A and B. Hence, when we select A out of 5 values, say A ∈{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, one of the ﬁve
values for A must give an appropriate B according to (7) such that a = a(A, B) is a justifying
assignment for P and P(a) = 0.
The next two lemmas extend the polynomial P in Lemma 3.3 to more variables, but still being
multilinear. The ﬁrst extension introduces w-variables in T2.
Lemma 3.4. Let k, m, n ∈N be positive. Deﬁne the polynomials
T1(x) =
X
s
csxs
T2(z, w) =
X
u,v
du,vzuwv ,
where
• s, u, and v run over the strings in {0, 1}k, {0, 1}m, and {0, 1}n, respectively,
• xs is a variable for each s ∈{0, 1}k and similarly for the zu and wv, and
• cs, du,v ∈C are coeﬃcients such that
– c1 ̸= 0 and d1,1 ̸= 0,
– ∃s ̸= 1 cs ̸= 0,
– ∃u ̸= 1 ∃v du,v ̸= 0 and ∃u ∃v ̸= 1 du,v ̸= 0.
Fix a nonzero α ∈C and deﬁne
P = T1T2 −αc1d1,1x1z1w1 .
Then P is indecomposable and hence irreducible.
