Non-adiabatic and non-closed evolutionary paths play a significant role in the fidelity of quan-
tum gates. We propose a high-fidelity quantum control framework based on the quasi-topological
number (νqua), which extends the traditional Chern number to characterize geometric responses
in non-closed paths. By introducing a counterdiabatic gauge potential (AGP) that dynamically
suppresses non-adiabatic transitions and reconstructs path curvature, we demonstrate that νqua —a
relative homotopy invariant of compact manifolds in parameter space—quantifies the robustness
of geometric phases during open-path quantum evolution. This integer invariant ensures gauge-
invariant suppression of decoherence errors arising from dynamical phase coupling. By introducing
nonlinear parametric ring paths, we address the defects caused by intermediate states in the Rydberg
atomic system. Numerical simulations in the Kitaev superconducting chain and 2D transverse-field
Ising model confirm that our protocol achieves quantum gate fidelity exceeding F > 0.9999. We
bridges geometric quantum control with topological protection, offering a universal approach to
noise-resistant quantum computing.
Introduction—The pursuit of fault-tolerant quantum
computation faces a fundamental challenge: preserving
quantum state fidelity against environmental noise and
control errors. While geometric phases [1–3] offer inher-
ent resilience by encoding quantum information in global
properties of evolution paths, existing geometric gates
strictly require adiabatic evolution along closed paths in
parameter space [4–6], imposing impractical constraints
on realistic quantum control. Recent advances in coun-
terdiabatic driving (CD) [7] mitigate non-adiabatic er-
rors but remain confined to closed-path geometries, leav-
ing dynamical-phase-induced decoherence unresolved in
non-closed paths—a regime unavoidable in experiments
due to microwave crosstalk in superconducting circuits
[8, 9] or laser fluctuations in atomic systems [10–16].
In this letter, we transcend these limitations by estab-
lishing a non-adiabatic geometric quantum gate frame-
work via quasi-topological invariants and counterdia-
batic gauge potentials (AGP). We prove that the integer-
valued quasi-topological number νqua—a relative homo-
topy invariant—quantifies geometric phase robustness for
open paths in compact parameter manifolds.
By dy-
namically reconstructing path curvature through AGP
[17], our protocol suppresses non-adiabatic transitions
and achieves U(1)-gauge-invariant phase decoupling, en-
abling F > 0.9999 fidelity in Rydberg atom simulations.
This approach unifies geometric control with topologi-
cal protection, offering a hardware-agnostic solution for
noise-resilient quantum computation.
AGP achieves precise cancellation of non-adiabatic
terms—CD has been discussed widely, and we already
know its properties. We introduce a counterdiabatic po-
tential [17]

We expand it and obtain
Aλ = −i

m̸=n
|m⟩⟨m| ∂λH(λ) |n⟩⟨n|
(Em −En)

The wavefunction can separate phases and write them
out in the form of time evolution.
|ψ⟩= e−iϕ |n⟩
(3)
Analogous to the Berry phase method, we obtain that:
i ⟨m|∂λn⟩= ⟨m| Aλ |n⟩
(4)
We demonstrated that this is non-diagonal, and it can
maintain the form of geometric phase. So we consider
the transition probability from state |n⟩to |m⟩, which is
derived from non-adiabatic effects. After a series of calcu-
lations(see the supplementary), we can obtain a equation
as:
cm(t) =
Z t
0
exp[i
Z t′
0
(Em −En)dτ] ˙λ
× (i ⟨m|∂λn⟩−⟨m| Aλ |n⟩)dt′
= 0

So AGP can offset the effects of non-diabatic accurately,
as shown in Fig.1.
The topological properties of non-adiabatic non-closed
paths—The issues related to non-adiabatic effects were
addressed in the previous section. We now turn to con-
sider the case of non-closed paths(λ(t) ∈M,t ∈[0, T]).
Within the parameter space, the Berry connection and
Berry curvature can be well expressed along closed paths
[1]. For non-closed paths, it is important to recognize
that the expression form of the Berry curvature remains
unchanged, although the initial and final states are al-
tered. Therefore, we first stipulate that the initial and
final states are known and fixed. Non-closed paths are
difficult to handle, but we can choose a random path
