0 < |q| < qc, this dotted line would be to the left of qc/m0. The tanh-type A solutions
are realized in the shaded region with −p0 < p < p0, and the associated r(τ) trajectory
is given by the solid line in Figure 11. In the unshaded region p2 < p < p1, between the
diagonal lines and to the left of qc/m0, both tan-type A and B are realized; the associated
r(τ) trajectories are, respectively, given by the dotted and dashed lines in Figure 11. The
region p0 < p < p2 is forbidden.
In the supercritical region qc < |q| < qd, all values of p in the range −p0 < p < p1 are
allowed, and the associated phase-space trajectories are shown in the left panel of Figure 13.
The single-bounded motion N in the right panel of Figure 11 merges with the unbounded
motion A0 at |q| = qc to yield two new unbounded trajectories N1 (corresponding to the
unshaded region p2 < p < p1), and N2 (corresponding to the shaded region −p0 < p < p2)
in Figure 13. The remaining unbounded motions An and Bn (n = 1, 2, . . .) are all described
by, respectively, by the tan-type A and B solutions. In both Figures 11 and 13, the analogous
trajectories in ﬂat space electrodynamics (the dot-dashed curves) are shown to illustrate
the strongly deforming effects of gravity on the trajectories.

Figure 13. Phase-space trajectories for |q| > qc and H0/m0 = 3 Left: Unbounded motions for
|q|/m0 = 0.3. Right: Unbounded motions for |q|/m0 = 2. A comparison to the motion in ﬂat space
electrodynamics (κ = 0) is given in the left panel.
Finally, for |q| > qd, all solutions are tan-type A and B since p2 < −p0. Sample-phase
space trajectories are shown in the right panel of Figure 13. A characteristic cusp appears at
r = 0 in the N1 and N2 trajectories. For the B trajectories, the motion switches between B0
(for −p0 ≤p ≤p0) and B1 (for p2 ≤p ≤−p0 and p0 ≤p ≤p1); the full motion is denoted
B01. B12 is likewise composed of a combination of B1 and B2.
