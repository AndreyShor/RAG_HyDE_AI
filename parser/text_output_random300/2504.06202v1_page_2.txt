Introduction
The conformal loop ensemble (CLE) is introduced in [35] as a universal candidate for the scaling
limit of a large class of discrete statistical physics models at criticality, e.g. Bernoulli percolation
[37, 5], the Ising model [7, 4] and the random-cluster model with cluster weight q = 2 (also known
as FK Ising) [38, 18, 17]. For κ ∈(8/3, 4], CLEκ in a simply connected domain D ⊊C is almost
surely (a.s.) a countable collection of disjoint simple loops. For κ ∈(4, 8), the loops in CLEκ are
a.s. non-simple and can touch each other. In this paper, we work on the regime of simple CLE,
i.e. where κ ∈(8/3, 4]. Many basic properties of simple CLE are established in the foundational
work [36]. In particular, CLEκ was constructed there using the outer boundaries of the outermost
clusters in the Brownian loop soup with intensity α ∈(0, 1/2], where
α = (3κ −8)(6 −κ)/(4κ).

In this paper, we focus on estimates on four-arm events in a simple CLE, in particular with a
view to applying them to statistical physics models converging to such a CLE. More specifically, our
aim is to derive, from these estimates, a qualitative description of the set of contact edges between
clusters. For example, the clusters of a subcritical or a critical random walk loop soup (RWLS) are
known to converge to simple CLE [40, 29], and the upper bounds on four-arm probabilities for CLE
that we obtain in this paper serve as an input in [13], where we derive various properties in the
discrete setting, on four-arm events in the RWLS. The points where four arms occur in the RWLS
correspond exactly to the contact edges between two clusters. Plugging in the four-arm estimates
for the RWLS into a summation argument over all possible configurations of contact edges between
the clusters, we prove in [14] the existence of a phase transition for percolation of the level sets in
the occupation field of a subcritical RWLS, and an analogous result at criticality. This analysis,
via an isomorphism between the (critical) RWLS and the discrete Gaussian free field (GFF) [28],
then yields corresponding results for two-sided level sets in the discrete GFF.
Arm exponents often happen to be an important quantity to analyze statistical physics models.
The polychromatic arm exponents for Bernoulli percolation (and the one-arm exponent) have been
first predicted by theoretical physics methods (see in particular [1], and the references therein).
They were established rigorously in [39], shortly after the introduction of the Schramm-Loewner
evolutions (SLE) [33].
More precisely, in that paper, Smirnov and Werner computed the arm
exponents of SLEκ for κ = 6, and then they appealed to the relation between SLE6 and planar
Bernoulli percolation at criticality [37]. The proof in [39] relies on previous works [24, 25, 26], which
computed other closely related exponents for SLEκ for κ ∈(0, 8) by using suitable SLE martingales.
The values of the SLE arm exponents for all κ ∈(0, 8) were also derived by physicists through the
KPZ relation, see e.g. [10, 11]: For j ≥1, the interior 2j-arm exponent ξ2j and the boundary j-arm
exponent ξ+
j are given by
ξ2j = 16j2 −(κ −4)2
