We recall that ξ and η represent the real and imaginary parts of λ ∼Tr [ϱLk], satisfy the relation:
|λ|2 = n(n + 1), where n is the average particle number. Although we impose the above initial
condition as an illustrative example, the effects discussed here are not restricted to the squeezed
vacuum state. In fact, any initial conditions corresponding to more general initial states can be
considered. In a Minkowski background, the vacuum state is uniquely defined as n(0) = 0. For
n(0) ≥1 and arbitrary θ, the states correspond to excited states, which can be expressed as
squeezed vacuum states. Without interaction with the scalar field (α = 0), n0 remains constant,
and λ0 evolves as λ0 = e−2ixλ0(0). Thus, the graviton number remains independent of the internal
phase (i.e. the intrinsic phase of λ). In the left panel of Fig. 1, we plot the time evolution of n0, ξ0,
and η0 for n0(0) = ξ0(0) = η0(0) = 1.
When turning on interactions (α ̸= 0), the internal phase and number are coupled. For a typical
parameter choice relevant to LIGO/Virgo-like gravitational wave interferometers [1], we take:
• ℓ∼k−1 = O(106)m: the LIGO-Virgo detectable scale is O(100)Hz.
