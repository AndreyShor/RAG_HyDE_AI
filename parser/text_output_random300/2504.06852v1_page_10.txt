FIG. 6: Magnon bands of Kagome lattice with different D/J. Here, we take S = 1, J = 1 meV, gJµBBz = −3 meV.
Then as D/J increases, band gaps increase, and the low-
est band decrease.
Next, we study the variation of the magnon spin pho-
toconductivity with D through model calculation, and
discuss the relationship between the magnon spin photo-
conductivity and the topological property of the magnon
system.
In Fig.
7 (a), we take J = 1 meV, and as
D increases, when D <
√
3 meV (D/J <
√
3, cor-
responding to Fig.
6 (a)-(d)), the Chern number set
is (1, 0, −1); when D >
√
3 meV (D/J >
√
3, corre-
sponding to Fig. 6 (f) and (g)), the Chern number set
is (−1, 0, 1).
Similar to the case of Hexagonal lattice,
because magnons conform to the Bose distribution, rel-
atively more magnons cluster on the lowest band, the
Chern number of the lowest band has a greater contribu-
tion to the magnon spin photoconductivity. Therefore,
in Fig. 7 (c),
i
ωa2ν χe
xx(ω) is greater than zero when the
Chern number set is (1, 0, −1) (D/J <
√
3) and is less
than zero when the Chern number set is (−1, 0, 1). And
when D = 0 meV, the magnon spin conductivity is zero
because of the ETRS (detail see Sec.
III). In Fig.
6
(b)-(d), as D/J increase, the lowest band remains rela-
tively flat, and the lowest band basically does not rise
or fall as a whole.
So when D/J <
√
3 (Chern num-
ber set is (1, 0, −1)), the magnon spin photoconductivity
varies little with D, but it does change with tempera-
ture according to Eq. 40. However, when D/J >
√
3,
the lowest band as a whole fall with the increase of D.
