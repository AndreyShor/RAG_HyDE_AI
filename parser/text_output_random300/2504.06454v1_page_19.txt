In eutectic HEAs, the ability to modify the eutectic microstructure morphology is
anticipated to alter superconducting properties and enhance Jc. A Japanese research
team comprising members from the Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Tokyo Metropoli-
tan University, and Kyushu Sangyo University investigated NbScTiZr, a eutectic HEA
known to consist of (NbTi)-enriched bcc and (ScZr)-enriched hcp phases[88, 89]. The
superconducting properties of as-cast NbScTiZr were studied by Krnel et al.[89],
who reported bulk superconductivity in the bcc phase with Tc=7.3 K. The Japanese
team further explored the eﬀects of annealing on the fundamental superconducting
properties and Jc[55, 90].
5.2 Fundamental superconducting properties
Figure 17(a) depicts the XRD patterns of all prepared samples, which can be inter-
preted as a superposition of patterns corresponding to the bcc and hcp phases. The
lattice parameters (aexp) of the bcc phase are plotted as a function of annealing
temperature in Fig. 17(b), with the as-cast sample considered equivalent to anneal-
ing at 0 ◦C. The ideal lattice parameter (ahard) is calculated using the hard-sphere
model, which assumes the absence of lattice strain. The lattice strain is then quanti-
ﬁed using the lattice deviation, deﬁned as (aexp −ahard)/ahard × 100. The deviation
exhibits a shallow minimum of -6 % at 400 ◦C. Notably, the magnitude of this
deviation is larger compared to other HEA superconductors, such as HfMoNbTiZr (-
1.7 %)[29] and (Ti35Hf25)(Nb25Ta5)Re10 (-2.3 %)[30]. This suggests that, similar to
Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 and (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5, thermal annealing induces lat-
tice strain, which appears to be a common characteristic of Nb-based HEAs. While the
origin of the lattice strain induced by thermal annealing in Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6
and (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 remains unclear, interface strengthening is responsible for
