FIG. 2. Experimental setup and sample characterization. a, The polarization of the tunable
pump laser can be defined by a combination of half-waveplate (HWP) and a wire-grid polarizer
(WG). The laser is subsequently focused on the exfoliated WSe2 monolayer and the emitted NLO
signal is collimated in transmission geometry. Further, a combination of shortpass (SP) and long-
pass (LP) filters are used for spectral filtering of the signal. A second stage of polarization filtering
is done with a Glen-Thompson prism (GT). In a last step, the remaining signal is guided either to
a spectrometer or to a silicon avalanche photodiode (APD). The inset shows the bright- and dark-
field images of the WSe2 sample. b, PL spectrum of the exfoliated WSe2 monolayer (black). The
spectrum shows a pronounced peak centered around ∼750 nm, indicating its monolayer nature. c,
Raman spectrum showing the degenerate E1
2g and A1g modes as well as the second-order 2LA(M)
mode. Their frequency difference of ∼11 cm−1 and the absence of the B1
2g peak at ∼309 cm−1
underpins further the identification of a monolayer. d, Co-polarized polarization-dependent SHG
pattern, measuring the emitted SH signal parallel to the polarization of the incident pump. Black
dots represent the experimental data for a fundamental wavelength of 1500 nm and the red line is
a cos2-fit of the data.
