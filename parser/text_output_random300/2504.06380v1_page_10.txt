the coercive field value for the supposed switching of the magnetization direction of the
magnetic ordering from one to another with the change in the direction of the applied field
(SI- 2). Now, as soon as the field is stopped sweeping and is held at −12.5 mT for the next
300 seconds, Rxx rises sharply, forming a peak and subsequently relaxes transiently32 to a
steady state value (blue curve) with time, t. This transient effect is quite surprising, and one
may think this could be due to the settling of the moments of the TBG in the energetically
favored magnetic ordered state at the B||stop. When we start ramping the magnetic field
again after the stop interval from B||stop (i.e.,−12.5 mT) towards +300 mT we see the Rxx
curve traces the familiar path of RBW
xx
(black curve) as shown Figure. 1d (top panel) with
a Rxx peak appearing with t at a time when B|| = +17 mT. The Rxx vs. B|| for magnetic
field sweep performed as +300 mT →B||stop(−12.5) mT →stop interval→+300 mT is
shown in Figure. 3c. But what happens if we start sweeping the magnet from B||stop towards
−300 mT after the stop interval?
Strikingly in the time-space, we observe a broadened
peak (second red curve in Figure. 3b (top panel)) appearing as soon we start ramping the
magnet before settling to the similar values of RFW
xx
for −300 mT < B|| < −100 mT when
compared with the red curve in Figure. 1d (top panel). If the system is expected to have
already settled in a favorable ordered state under the aegis of B||stop for a sweep direction of
+300 mT →−300 mT, the appearance of the peak again in a sweep towards B||stop →−300
mT indicates an anomaly. The transient effect and observing the peak while sweeping both
the directions after B||stop raises a question about whether the observed hysteresis in Rxx
is related to intrinsic magnetic order or some external effects, which can give rise to such
hysteresis behavior in TBG with applied B. Similar ‘time-series’ behavior of other B||stop
values are shown in SI-Fig. 5,6,7.
