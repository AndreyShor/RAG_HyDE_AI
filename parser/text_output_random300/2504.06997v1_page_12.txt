Fig. 6 Pulsatile CBFi waveform recovered from the test dataset, with a smoothing function applied (default method: 
moving average, span=ceil(0.1×length(𝑥𝑥))). The green line represents the CBFi waveform estimated by the DL 
model, the red curve denotes the simulated brain 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏 ground truth, and the blue line corresponds to the simulated 
scalp 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏. 
Fig. 7 presents the recovered rCBFi using the proposed DL model alongside the relative change in 
decorrelation speed measured by single-exponential fitting. The results indicate that both the DL 
model and the fitting method can capture the relative change in the ground truth rCBFi, with the 
DL model providing a closer match to the ground truth than single-exponential fitting. 
Additionally, both methods show an increasing trend in recovered relative changes as SBFi 
increases, suggesting that they are influenced by SBFi variations. The quantitative analysis and 
comparison of these recovered relative blood flow changes is provided in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. 
 
Fig. 7 Recovered relative CBF changes using the DL model and single-exponential fitting on the simulated dataset, 
with a smoothing function applied. The green line represents the relative change in CBFi estimated by the DL 
model, the blue line corresponds to the relative change in decorrelation speed measured by single-exponential 
fitting, and the red line denotes the simulated ground truth. 
3.3 Model’s brain sensitivity compared with single-exponential fitting 
In this section, we quantified the model’s brain sensitivity calculated using Eq. (10). Baseline CBFi 
was obtained using the mean value of the recovered CBFi from 100 noise-added data. As described
