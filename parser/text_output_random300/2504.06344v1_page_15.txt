to be contracted with the appropriate quaternions. Here ¯Aω
µ is the component of ¯Aµ (2.5)
along ω, i.e. ¯Aµ = ω ¯Aω
µ.
Eqn. (2.18) is obtained by setting ∆= 0 in eqn. (4.15) in [1], where more details of the
straightforward but somewhat tedious derivation can be found. On the tuned T4, the meaning
of eqn. (2.18) is that its solutions, subject to the BCS (2.13, 2.14, 2.15) span the manifold
of self-dual configurations of charge Q = r/N on the tuned T4. Below, we shall study the
manifold of such self-dual configurations using a perturbation series in the nonlinearity λ.
To this end, we assume that a perturbative series of S and W exists such that
Wk×ℓ=
∞
X
a=0
λaW(a)k×ℓ,
S =
∞
X
a=0
λaS(a) ,
(2.20)
where S accounts for Sω, Sk, and Sℓ.
Expanding to O(λ0), we find that the linearized
self-dual fluctuations around the constant instanton obey the equations:15
O(λ0) :
¯DW(0)k×ℓ= 0 ,
2πℓ¯∂S(0)ωIk + ¯∂S(0)k = 0 ,
−2πk ¯∂S(0)ωIℓ+ ¯∂S(0)ℓ= 0 ,
(2.21)
where the solutions must be endowed with the appropriate BCS from (2.13, 2.14, 2.15).
These leading-order equations were solved in [1] and, in what follows, we shall make use of
the solutions given there, and reproduced in Appendix A. We now consider separately the
cases gcd(k, r) = r and gcd(k, r) ̸= r.

Moduli space of Q= r
N instantons on the tuned T4 with gcd(k, r) = r
We begin with the tuned T4, with ∆(k, r, ℓ) = 0 (1.3) and gcd(k, r) = r. Here, we shall
show that the equations defining the moduli space of Q = r/N self-dual instantons (2.18)
only admit constant-F solutions. In section 3.1, we show this analytically, to all orders in the
λ-expansion we set up above. Then, in section 3.2, we give numerical evidence, for N = 3,
k = r = 2 and k = r = 1 that, indeed, only constant field strength fractional instanton
solutions exist. We also show that the numerical minimization of the action, starting from
random configurations, covers the entire moduli space of the constant-F fractional instanton
solutions known from analytic studies.
15Eqns. (2.21) are obeyed by linearized self-dual fluctuations around the instanton, subject to the background
gauge condition (2.16). These equations are related to the adjoint-fermion Dirac equation in the instanton
background, see [1]. Recall that the dimension of the moduli space of self-dual solutions is related to (twice)
the index of the adjoint Dirac operator, see [50, 51, 61, 62] and the reviews [30, 63].
