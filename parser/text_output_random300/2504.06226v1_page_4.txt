One can quantify the randomness and fluctuation in ther-
mal charges reaching L by calculating Current-Current
auto correlation functions and defining a fano-factor at
this junction, which we will see in the next section.
Although junctions L and P are potential noise-spots,
we can only measure the noise at the contacts of the
device, which are S, D1, and D2. By exploiting the ro-
tational symmetry in the device, we can determine the
presence and absence of noise by only looking at the con-
tact S and the junction adjacent to it. The segments OL,
LH2 and LH contribute to transporting thermal charge
towards S. So, in the situation that the thermal charge
transport is Ballistic in all three segments, we can con-
clude that S will experience no noise. We construct an
array ([OL, LH2, LH1]) to represent the nature of flow in
these three segments while discussing individual cases in
later sections, where each element tells the nature of ther-
mal current flow in the corresponding segment, namely
ballistic (B), anti-ballistic (AB).

Auto and cross correlation fano-factors
The goal of this section is to provide an outline of the
calculations for auto and cross current-correlations, but
we highly recommend going through [40] for more details.
Measurable quantities in an experiment for a device as
shown in Fig. 1 are the variances in current measured at
both the drains D1 and D2. If current I1 and I2 end up
at the respective drains D1 and D2, then the variances
can be given by
δ2I1 = ⟨(I1 −⟨I1⟩)2⟩,
(6a)
δ2I2 = ⟨(I2 −⟨I2⟩)2⟩,
(6b)
δ2Ic = ⟨(I1 −⟨I1⟩)(I2 −⟨I2⟩)⟩,
(6c)
where we call δ2Ii (for i = 1, 2) as auto-current correla-
tions and δ2Ic as cross-current correlation. Here we can
call the quantities Ii−⟨Ii⟩as fluctuations in the respective
currents, which are given by net fluctuations in the seg-
ments leading up to the drains given by ∆ILH! + ∆IH!P
and ∆ILH2 + ∆IH2P respectively for i = 1, 2. Current
fluctuations in the system are primarily because of volt-
age fluctuations and thermal fluctuations, which are as
follows.

Using these quantities in Eq. (6) along with the
Johnson-Nyquist equations, which provide variance in
thermal fluctuations as functions of temperature, we find
the auto and cross correlation equations.
To complete the calculation, we need the noise at the
source (O) and ground (Q) (Fig. 1) and temperatures
of the hot-spots which are dependent on the nature of
transport in each of the three segments. Because they
determine the direction of electric and thermal current
leading to different conservation equations in each case.

for the ν = 12/5 sample and L is the geometric length of
the edge.

Case-by-case discussion of each state
After having developed the necessary tools to per-
form Auto and Cross-correlation calculations, we can
now talk about how to calculate them.
In this work,
we have proposed the use of three different filling frac-
tions in combination with 12/5 to completely distinguish
among the candidate states, which are {ν, νi} ={12/5,2},
{12/5, 7/3}, and {3, 12/5}. Unlike in the ν = 5/2 case
[44], for ν = 12/5 case, experimental or numerical stud-
ies on the thermal equilibration lengths and regimes are
not abundant. Therefore, to prepare a robust methodol-
ogy to reliably predict the candidate state, we need to be
able to identify the equilibation regime from the noise in
the system. But as it turns out in the case of ν = 12/5,
