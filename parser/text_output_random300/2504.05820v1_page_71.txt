Tools and methodology

Regarding the integrability conditions, the momentum sum rule and valence sum rule imply
respectively a vanishing small-x limit of the second moment of g, Σ and the first moment of
V, V3, V8. As observed in Ref. [109], to fulfill these conditions, it is sufficient to restrict the range
of the small-x preprocessing exponent Eq. (2.27) to: αi < 2 for g, Σ and αi < 1 for the other
non-singlet combinations. However, Regge theory arguments suggest also
lim
x→0 xfk(x, Q) = 0 ,
∀Q ,
fk = T3, T8 ,
(2.31)
which are then imposed using Lagrange multipliers, evaluated at x = 10−9 and penalize
configurations with T3, T8 non-vanishing moments.
2.3.2. Kinematic coverage
The data used in the NNPDF4.0 analysis [109], in the subsequent updates [6, 3, 11] and in
the related studies [1, 2] are discussed in details in [109, Sec. 2]. Here, we limit ourselves to
list the type of processes, the experiments and the tools used to compute the corresponding
predictions.
• Fixed-target DIS. We include neutral current (NC) structure function data from NMC [159,
160], SLAC [161] and BCDMS [162], fixed-target inclusive and dimuon charged current
(CC) cross-section data from CHORUS [163] and NuTeV [164, 165]. Theoretical predic-
tions are computed with Yadism at NNLO in QCD with massive corrections included as in
the FONLL scheme (cf. Section 1.4.2).
• Collider DIS. We consider collider NC and CC cross-section data from HERA [166]
together with the reduced charm and bottom cross-section from H1 and ZEUS [167, 168,
169]. To compute the theoretical predictions, we adopt the same setting as fixed-target
DIS data.
• Fixed-target DY. Among all the Fermilab data we select measurements from E605 [170]
and E866,E906 [171, 172, 173], as well as rapidity distributions from Tevatron CDF [174]
and D0 [175, 176, 177]. Corresponding FK-tables are computed with Vrap [146] at NLO
with the inclusion of NNLO K-factors.
• Collider gauge boson production. We encompass inclusive cross-sections, differential
distributions in the gauge boson invariant mass or rapidity from ATLAS [178, 179, 180,
181], CMS [182, 183, 184, 185] and LHCb [186, 187, 188, 189]. Data include central
rapidity regions as well as more forward production; in all the selected measurements the
electroweak boson decays leptonically. We also include Z-boson transverse momentum
production data from ATLAS [190] and CMS [191]. Data are described with NLO calcula-
tions from Mg5aMC@NLO [142, 143] supplemented with NNLO K-factors from FEWZ [192,
193, 194] and DYNNLO [195, 196].
