No-scale supergravity
which can be implemented in two different versions. In cases such as the sin-
gle extra dimension compactified on a circle considered in [33], the twist of
the boundary conditions leading to supersymmetry breaking corresponds to
a global continuous R-symmetry of the higher-dimensional action: the tree-
level spectrum depends on a single modulus R, the compactification radius,
and we can smoothly take the limit of small twist parameters, corresponding
to m3/2 ≪MC ∼1/R. However, when the compactification involves three
or more internal dimensions we can use general coordinate transformations
to twist boundary conditions [40]. This kind of Scherk–Schwarz compactifi-
cations are also known as twisted tori compactifications, since the boundary
conditions act on the geometry of the internal manifold, modifying its struc-
ture. After a field redefinition, twisted boundary conditions can be replaced
by a VEV for the spin connection, which leads to observable effects be-
cause the compact space is non-simply connected, in analogy with gauge
symmetry breaking by Wilson lines. As explained for example in [42], these
VEVs can be seen as ‘metric fluxes’, with quantized twist parameters and
m3/2 ∼MC ∼1/R. The reduced theory is then a mere consistent truncation
rather than a genuine effective theory [43, 44, 45]: this is obvious when the
compactification manifold remains a torus and supersymmetry appears to
be broken in the reduced truncated theory but is left unbroken in the full
compactified theory; however, this can also be the case when supersymmetry
is broken, since in the full compactified theory there can be physical states
truncated away and others included in the reduced theory with comparable
masses.
After the introduction of compactifications of the heterotic superstring, or
of the associated N = 4, d = 10 supergravity, preserving N = 1, d = 4 super-
symmetry, for example on Calabi-Yau manifolds [46] or on six-dimensional
toroidal orbifolds [47], it was soon realised that the reduced theories, contain-
ing only the finite number of massless degrees of freedom for unbroken super-
symmetry, have many of the features of no-scale models [48, 49, 50, 51, 52].
The only missing ingredient is a suitable superpotential triggering supersym-
metry breaking, which of course cannot be derived from compactifications
that preserve N = 1 supersymmetry by construction. In the first superstring-
inspired versions of N = 1, d = 4 no-scale models, this superpotential
was introduced as an ad hoc assumption, motivated by non-perturbative
effects [53, 54]. The first no-scale models actually derived from coordinate-
dependent compactifications of the heterotic superstring [55, 56, 57] à la
Scherk-Schwarz were obtained in [58, 59].
With the advent of flux compactifications of superstring theories, many
new possibilities for generating d = 4 no-scale models opened up [60, 61, 62,
