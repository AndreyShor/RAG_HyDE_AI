This is another Lifshitz transition: number of the Fermi points doubles {±kF,1} →{±kF,1, ±kF,2},
yielding a cusp of ¯n(µ) in the IC phase, seen in Fig. 2d. When µ reaches the upper critical
value
µc,2 = max ε± ,
(A6)
where the maxima of ε± occur at kmax, both bands become totally filled, and a quantum
transition of the second order occurs into the fully filled ¯n = 1 (polarized) gapped phase.
Explicitly:
kmax = ± arcsin

The gaps in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian close/open linearly near k = ±π/2 or ±kmax
at two critical points at the edges of plateaux:
∆= |µ −µc,♯|
−→
zν = 1 .
(A9)
At the critical points µc,1/2 the excitation spectrum is parabolic:
ε±(k) −µc,1/2 ∝(k −k♯)2 ,
(A10)
where k♯= π
2 and k♯= kmax for µc,1 and µc,2, respectively. In the gapless phase at µc,1 <
µ < µL the excitation spectrum is linear near kF,1 with the Fermi velocity vF,1, while at
µL < µ < µc,2 two linear spectra have different Fermi velocities vF,1 ̸= vF,2. They are defined
as:
vF,1/2 =
