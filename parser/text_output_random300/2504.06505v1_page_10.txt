FIG. 3. Comparison of coarse-grained (CG) models run with Brownian dynamics and all-atom (AA) simulations. 
Each panel shows results from two CG models initialized with different parameters, represented in orange and green. 
(A) Radial distribution function; (B) Three-body correlation; (C) Mean squared displacement. The results from the 
AA simulations are displayed in blue. Transparent curves indicate results from the initial models, while solid curves 
represent those from the trained models.  
 
The dynamical property that we focused on was the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the COM 
of each water molecule, which is defined as: 
 
𝑀𝑆𝐷(𝑡) = 〈|𝑹(𝑡) −𝑹(0)|<〉.

The MSD of the CG models is compared against the AA reference data in Fig. 3(c) (Brownian dynamics) 
and 4(c) (Langevin dynamics). Initially, the MSD profiles of the unoptimized CG models deviate markedly 
from the AA simulations, reflecting discrepancies in dynamic behavior. After optimization with the 
dynamic matching framework, the CG models exhibit MSD curves that align closely with the AA 
benchmarks. This agreement confirms that the CG models not only reproduce structural correlations (as 
seen in RDFs/ADFs) but also accurately capture the diffusion dynamics of the AA system. Notably, the 
length of trajectories used for training (0.4 ps) is shorter than the longest lag time shown in Fig. 3(c) and 
4(c) (4.0 ps). The training length in fact only goes a relatively small way into the transition to the diffusive 
regime. This demonstrates that the optimized CG models can extrapolate essential dynamical features of 
the reference system – even when trained on limited short-time data – while retaining predictive accuracy 
at longer timescales. 
 
For the system studied here, we observed no significant difference in the ability of CG models to 
reproduce dynamical properties – regardless of whether Brownian or Langevin dynamics was employed. 
This suggests that, for simple systems like water, the choice of dynamics equation of CG simulations has 
minimal impact on capturing diffusive behavior. However, we anticipate that the selection of dynamics 
(e.g., inertial vs. overdamped) may lead to divergent dynamical behavior in CG models of more complex 
systems, such as polymers, biomolecules, or biomolecular assemblies. A systematic investigation of these 
effects lies beyond the scope of this work and will be explored in future studies.
