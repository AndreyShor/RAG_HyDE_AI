GRAPHICAL FUNCTIONS WITH SPIN
7
Proof. As in the proof of Lemma 4 we consider {1, . . . , |α|} as vertex set of a graph Γ. For any π ∈Πα
1
the edges of Γ are the pairs of π0, while the elements in π1 are isolated vertices. We obtain a graph
with vertex degree ≤1. The graph of π1 ∪π2 with π1, π2 ∈Πα
1 has vertex degree ≤2. Loops in π1 ∪π2
contribute a factor of D to the bilinear form, whereas (after relabeling the indices) open strings contribute

Let L(π1, π2) be the number of loops in the graph of π1 ∪π2. We get (as in the proof of Lemma 4)
⟨π1, π2⟩1 = DL(π1,π2). In particular, ⟨π, π⟩1 = D|π0|. If π1 ̸= π2 with π0
1 ̸= ∅̸= π0
2, the degree of ⟨π1, π2⟩1
is strictly smaller than min(|π0
1|, |π0
2|). If π0
1 = ∅or π0
2 = ∅, the graph of π1 ∪π2 has no loops and we
get ⟨π1, π2⟩1 = 1. If we arrange this partition into the first slot, the matrix of ⟨·, ·⟩1 has first column and
row 1 and in all other columns and rows strictly the highest powers of D on the diagonal. Therefore,
det(⟨π1, π2⟩1) has leading coefficient 1 in D and thus is non-zero. The claim follows.
□
For even spin |α| one can proceed as in the period case and split the |α| vertices into |α|/2 upper vertices
and |α|/2 lower vertices. This promotes every π ∈Πα
1 to an element in the rook-Brauer algebra which
is also semisimple for generic parameter D [13]. The bilinear form ⟨·, ·⟩1 is the trace in the rook-Brauer
algebra.
By Lemma 8 every partition π ∈Πα
1 has a dual ˆπ = ˆπ(α) in the vector space of formal sums of
partitions with coefficients in Q(D),

By linearity we extend ˆπ to gˆπ0zˆπ1

From (30) we hence obtain

ν01(0, ˆz1),
where we define gˆπ0Qˆπ1
ν01(0, ˆz1) in analogy to gˆπ0zˆπ1
1
in (29). We choose ν01 as in (31) to ensure that
G ∪01 is a period graph. More precisely, G gˆπ0Qˆπ1
ν01(0, ˆz1) is a linear combination of graphs with total
spin 0. In particular, the vertices 0 and 1 can be chosen freely when calculating its period (see Lemma 3)
so that we can drop the labels in G gˆπ0Qˆπ1
ν01(0, ˆz1). Extending the period to the graph algebra, we obtain
(compare (24))
(39)
PG,π = PGˆπ.
Substitution into (30) gives the two-point function as sum over propagators with spin zero Feynman
period coefficients,

With this formula one can eliminate any two-point insertion in a Feynman integral by a sum over prop-
agators in numerator form (2) with coefficients which are a product of a Feynman period and metric
tensors.
Example 9. We write G(α)gπ0(α)Qπ1(α)
ν01
for the spin 0 graph that is G(α) contracted with gπ0(α) and
edge 01 of spin π1(α) and weight ν01 as in (31). For |α| = 1, we get G[
(∅,1) = G(α1)Qα1
ν01.
For |α| = 2 we have Πα
1 = {({12}, ∅), (∅, 12)} and
G \
({12},∅) = G(α)gα1,α2Qν01 −G(α)Qα1,α2

G \
(∅,12) = −G(α)gα1,α2Qν01 + D G(α)Qα1,α2

For |α| = 3 we have Πα
1 = {({12}, 3), ({13}, 2), ({23}, 1), (∅, 123)}. We obtain
G \
({12},3) = G(α)gα1,α2Qα3

plus two cyclic permutations of the first equation. Results up to |α| = 10 are in [23].
