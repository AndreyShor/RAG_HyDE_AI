Factorisation and Resummation of the Drell-Yan Cross Section
The full Drell-Yan pp →Z/γ∗+ X →l+l−+ X cross section with a veto on the rapidity-
dependent observable Tfj < T cut (f = B, C) is given by,

where the first term contains the resummed logarithms of T cut/Q, and dominates at small
values of T cut, while the second term contains the nonsingular corrections which are sup-
pressed by O(T cut/Q) and are required to ensure the sum at large T cut reproduces the
fixed-order result. The resummed cross section can be calculated from a SCET factorisa-
tion formula as defined in refs. [1, 16],

and the sum is over ij = {u¯u, d ¯d, c¯c, s¯s, b¯b, ¯uu, ...}. The factorized formula includes a hard
function H, beam functions B and a soft function S. To resum large (double) logarithms
of T cut/Q, the hard, beam and soft functions are first evaluated at their ‘natural’ scales
|µH| ∼Q, µB ∼
p
QT cut and µS ∼T cut where large logarithms are absent from the
perturbative series for each individual ingredient. They are then renormalisation group
(RG) evolved to a common scale µ via the respective evolution factors UH, UB and US
which sums up the large logarithms. Here we take this common scale to be the ‘fixed
order’ scale µFO, which should be chosen to be of order of the hard process scale µFO ∼Q.
Ultimately we will produce predictions only for a small range of Q values centred on MZ,
so for the purpose of scale setting we will replace Q by MZ and take the central value of
µFO to be MZ.
For NLL′ predictions, one needs the fixed-order expansion of B, H, S and (non-cusp)
anomalous dimensions of these quantities to one loop, whilst for NNLL′ we need all of
these quantities at two loops. For the Drell-Yan process, we obtained the one- and two-
loop coefficients for the hard function from refs. [1] and [41] respectively. We require the
quark beam function Bq, which at perturbative T cut can be written as the convolution
of perturbative matching coefficients Iqj and the standard parton distribution functions
(PDFs) [1]. The one-loop and two-loop matching coefficients can be obtained by taking the
cumulant of the virtuality-dependent quark beam function matching coefficients computed
