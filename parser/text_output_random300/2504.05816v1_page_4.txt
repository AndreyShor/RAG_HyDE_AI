Now, we introduce two 2-vectors,
q = (
1q,
2q)
T,
r = (
1r,
2r)
T
(2.17)
and rewrite the above equations in the vector form,
qx = u σ2 r,
rx = −v σ2 q
(2.18)
and
qt = iuvq + iux σ2 r,
rt = −iuv r + ivx σ2 q,
(2.19)
where σ2 =
 0
−i
i
0

.
The restriction (2.10) now becomes
r
Tq = 1.
(2.20)
By a simple algebra one can obtain the following consequence of (2.18) and
(2.19):
iqt + qxx + λq = 0,
(2.21)
−ir
T
t + r
T
xx + λr
T = 0
(2.22)
with λ = 2uv as well as the identities
λ = −ir
Tqt −r
Tqxx = ir
T
t q −r
T
xxq
(2.23)
It is easy to see that equations (2.21) and (2.22) together with (2.23)
are the Euler–Lagrange equations for the action S =
R
dx dt L with the
Lagrangian
L = ir
Tqt −r
T
xqx + λ (r
Tq −1)
(2.24)
describing the vector linear Schr¨odinger system under the bilinear restriction
(2.20). In other words, we have demonstrated that starting from (2.4) one
can obtain solutions of the ‘two-field’ version of our problem.
An interesting fact, which has no direct relevance to our problem, is that
u and v defined in (2.9) satisfy

iut + uxx + 2u2v = 0,
−ivt + vxx + 2uv2 = 0.
(2.25)
So, as a by-products, we have obtained solutions for the nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation (see section 9.2 of [12]).
