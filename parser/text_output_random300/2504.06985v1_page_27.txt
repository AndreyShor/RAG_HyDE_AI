It is also useful to recall the trace identities for the adjoint representation of SU(n) [57]
tra F 6 = 2n tr F 6 + 30 (tr F 4)(tr F 2) −20(tr F 3)2 ,
tra F 4 = 2n tr F 4 + 6 (tr F 2)2 ,
tra F 2 = 2n tr F 2 .

Ultimately, this abstract analysis boils down to the information gathered together in tables
9, 10, 11, and 12.
