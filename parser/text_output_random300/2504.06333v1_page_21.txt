6.2.1
SymTFT in terms of gauge ﬁelds
Let us discuss how to implement the anomaly resolution above via SymTFTs. The
starting point is the SymTFT for an anomalous Z2 symmetry, which is a twisted
Z2 Dijkgraaf-Witten theory
Sω
Z2 = ∫M3
(2π
2 a1 ∪δˆa1 + 2π
4 a1 ∪δa1).
(6.6)
As in the conventional SymTFT setup, we introduce two boundaries for this 3D
bulk theory, one physical and the other topological. The physical boundary de-
ﬁnes local information of our interested 2D QFT, while the topological boundary
imposes the following boundary condition
a1∣∂= A1.
(6.7)
This boundary condition speciﬁes a Z2 global symmetry for the 2D QFT. The back-
ground ﬁeld is given by the boundary condition ﬁeld proﬁle A1, and the anomaly
is captured by a 3D anomaly inﬂow exp[iπ ∫M3 A1 ∪δA1].
Extending this anomalous Z2 into a non-anomalous Z4 symmetry requires ex-
tend the 3D bulk by promoting the topological boundary for Sω
Z2 into a topological
interface between Sω
Z2 and the SymTFT for Z4. In order to make the underlying
group extension manifest, we express the Z4 SymTFT as a twisted Z2
2 Dijkgraaf-
Witten theory
SZ4 = ∫M3 (2π
2 a1 ∪δˆa1 + 2π
2 b1 ∪δˆb1 −2π
4 a1 ∪δˆb1).
(6.8)
In addition to the topological interface, we introduce a topological boundary for
this SymTFT. The Z4 symmetry in 2D is realized by the following boundary
condition
a1∣∂= A1, b1∣∂= B1.
(6.9)
Naively, this gives rise to a Z2
2 symmetry. However, notice the equation of motion
for ˆb1 reads
δb1 = 1
2δa1,
(6.10)
which reduces to equation (6.4) under the topological boundary condition. This
implies a group extension structure for the two Z2’s and, as a result, speciﬁes a Z4
symmetry.
The SZ4 and Sω
Z2 theories are connected via gauging/condensing topological line
operators. Start with SZ4 theory, one can gauge a certain Z(1)
2
1-form symmetry
to obtain SZω
2 theory. Thus, one can perform a half-space gauging for SZ4 theory,
