replaced using the closure relations (A.4). Working in the holomorphic limit this provides at each
genus
F(g)(φ) = P (g)(Sφφ, Sφ, S) + f(g)(φ),
(A.10)
where P (g) is a polynomial with no degree-0 monomials and f(g)(φ) is a rational function of φ,
which the HAE do not fix. f(g) is known as the holomorphic ambiguity, and it must be determined
by incorporating additional data.
Assign degrees 1, 2, 3 respectively to Sφφ, Sφ, S. As a consequence of (A.8), the highest order
monomials in the polynomials P (g)(Sφφ, Sφ, S) are of degree 3g −3.
F(g)(φ) can only be singular when the B-model geometry Y
φ becomes singular. Depending on the
type of singularity that Y
φ acquires at φ = φsing, there are known behaviours of F(g). This is
how we can constrain f(g)(φ), and for certain low genera these constraints are strong enough to
completely fix f(g)(φ). In our example, in the space of φ over which Y
φ is fibred there are two
MUM points φ ∈{0, ∞} and three conifold points φ ∈{±i/(3
√
3), 1/27}. To be precise, 1/27 is a
hyperconifold point because there is an S3/Z3 on Y that shrinks, instead of an S3.
In an expansion about the N = 1 MUM point φ = 0, one has the constant term due to [57, 64, 65]:

(A.11)
Given the difficulties we have experienced with the other MUM point ϕ =
1
729φ = 0, we shall
initially only impose (A.11) at φ = 0. The only constraint we place on the behaviour of F (g)(φ) at
φ = ∞is that F (g)(t∞) is nonsingular. We justify this assumption by the argument in [34], that
F (g) can only be singular at a point where new massless charged states emerge in the effective 4d
spacetime theory. As no D-branes become massless at φ = ∞, as can be seen from the logarithmic
structure of the periods ϖ(H), we therefore expect regular behaviour.

The number b0 is fixed by (A.11). We will shortly turn to explaining how to fix the numbers b(1/27)
k
and b(1/√−27)
k,a
using the conifold gap condition (A.16). We will subsequently explain how we have
used regularity of the free energy at the apparent singularity φ = 5/9 to fix the numbers b(App)
k
.
The only numbers not determined by a regularity requirement are the 2g −2 numbers bk. Note
however that the highest power of φ in (A.12) being 2g−2 is a consequence of regularity of F (g)(t∞).
To fix these remaining bk, we use the Castelnuovo criterion as studied in [34], see also [82]. We
aim to use the Gopakumar-Vafa formula (3.24) to read off GV invariants n(g)
β
from F (g)(t). The
Castelnuovo criterion is that these numbers vanish unless g ≤gCastelnuovo(β), where
