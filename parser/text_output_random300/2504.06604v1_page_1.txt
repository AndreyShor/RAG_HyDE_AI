ABSTRACT
This study proposes a systematic image registration approach to align 2D optical thin-section images
within a 3D digital rock volume. Using template image matching with differential evolution opti-
mization, we identify the most similar 2D plane in 3D. The method is validated on a synthetic porous
medium, achieving exact registration, and applied to Berea sandstone, where it achieves a structural
similarity index (SSIM) of 0.990. With the registered images, we explore upscaling properties based
on paired multimodal images, focusing on pore characteristics and effective elastic moduli. The
thin-section image reveals 50 % more porosity and submicron pores than the registered CT plane. In
addition, bulk and shear moduli from thin sections are 25 % and 30 % lower, respectively, than those
derived from CT images. Beyond numerical comparisons, thin sections provide additional geological
insights, including cementation, mineral phases, and weathering effects, which are not clear in CT
images. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal image registration to improve computed
rock properties in digital rock physics by integrating complementary imaging modalities.

Introduction
Understanding pore-scale processes is essential for various subsurface applications, including groundwater flow [Zhu
et al., 1999, Bear and Cheng, 2010], carbon dioxide sequestration [Chen et al., 2019, Chung et al., 2023, 2024a],
underground hydrogen storage [Hashemi et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2023], and radioactive waste disposal [Curti et al.,
2019, Chung et al., 2019]. Traditionally, these processes have been investigated through laboratory experiments using
core plugs, which are time-consuming and challenging to reproduce. Recently, digital rock physics (DRP) utilizes
high-resolution digital rock images to perform pore-scale analysis and simulate physical processes to compute effective
properties [Andrä et al., 2013a,b]. DRP provides a non-destructive and cost-effective alternative to conventional
laboratory measurements [Berg et al., 2017]. In particular, micro-CT imaging has become a widely used tool in DRP
for computing effective properties, offering 3D rock microstructures while preserving sample integrity. It enables
permeability estimation via pore-scale fluid flow simulations [Blunt et al., 2013] and elastic moduli estimation via micro-
scale mechanical simulations [Zhu et al., 2017, Saxena and Mavko, 2016]. More recently, deep learning approaches
