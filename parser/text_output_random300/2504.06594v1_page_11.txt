Figure 3: Extrapolation results (black circles) for rms point radii rp, rm and rn in the
6Li ground state with increasing training data sets including the NCSM results obtained
with Nmax ≤N u

green triangles, orange triangles and violet diamonds present respectively machine learning
extrapolations ISU-a [11], ISU-b [16] and TUDa [16], and red diamonds present TTE
extrapolations [32].

version is clearly worse and the ﬁnal ISU-a and ISU-b results at Nu

only slightly overlap if the uncertainties are taken into account. From our
experience, it is better to exclude small ℏΩvalues in the training datasets
for the radii extrapolations. Our predicted rms point-proton radius rp is in
agreement with the results of machine learning approaches ISU-a and TUDa.
As compared to the ground state, in the case of the ﬁrst excited state
(3+, 0) of the 6Li nucleus, the uncertainties of the extrapolated values of the
rms point radii rp, rm, and rn are signiﬁcantly larger (see Table 2). However,
