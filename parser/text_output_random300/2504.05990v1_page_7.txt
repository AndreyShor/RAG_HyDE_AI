information was not available. For this demonstration study, patients from race groups with less 
than 20 patients were removed (American Indian or Alaska Native, N = 3; Native Hawaiian/Other 
Pacific Islander, N = 2). Patients from the groups of ‘More than one race’ (N = 58) and ‘Not 
reported’ (N = 29) were also removed due to the lack of data available for their SDOH category 
of race. After these exclusions, our study had a final dataset of 1,571 unique patients (Table 1).

2.2 Determination of phenogroups 
In this demonstration study, we used a deep learning model that has been previously 
described33 to predict the likelihood of pneumonia for the standard and soft tissue chest 
radiographs for each patient. In this study, these likelihoods were used as surrogate features to 
describe the radiomic phenotypes of the lung parenchyma in these ‘normal’ patients. First, 
surrogate features were calculated directly from the two types of chest radiographs (regular and 
soft-tissue acquisitions) using the deep learning model (Figure 3). Second, the surrogate features 
derived from each image type were projected via unsupervised principal component analysis 
(PCA)34,35 in anticipation of future workflows that might include more than two features (e.g., 
more than two quantitative values extracted from images). Third, Hotelling’s t-squared statistic36 
was calculated and served as the single numerical output for each patient. This value served as the 
overall ‘parenchymal score’, i.e., R, the radiomic phenotype for each patient. Lastly, unsupervised
