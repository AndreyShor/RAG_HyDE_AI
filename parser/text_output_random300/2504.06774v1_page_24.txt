have been made with SVD-based models developed using the same methodology and
hyperparameters.
The temporal evolution of the predictions was compared with the
ground truth to assess how well the models captured dynamic behavior over time.
For UQ, the error probability distribution has been plotted for all velocity components,
with the streamwise component (u) marked in red, the normal component (v) in green,
and the spanwise component (w) in blue. These comparisons provide a comprehensive
analysis of the predictive capabilities of the architectures and the dimensionality reduction
methods across all test cases.
It will also be particularly interesting to observe how the same architecture behaves in
different test cases. To investigate this, each of the three LSTM architectures will be tested
with similar neurons and activation functions in all three cases. This approach allows for
a consistent evaluation of the architecturesâ€™ adaptability and effectiveness in handling
varying flow scenarios. The following tables summarize the tuned hyperparameters used
for the LSTM architectures across different test cases.

Case: Laminar Flow Past a Circular Cylinder (2D)
This test case focuses on the classic flow past a two-dimensional cylinder at Re = 130,
a regime in which laminar vortices form in the wake of the cylinder. The original data
