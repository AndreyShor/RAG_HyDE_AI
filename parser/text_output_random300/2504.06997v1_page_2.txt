Introduction 
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is a critical biomarker for brain health and function, supporting 
cognitive and neurological processes1. Existing techniques, such as transcranial Doppler 
ultrasound (TCD) is non-invasive but relies on experienced operators and is limited to larger 
arteries2. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography 
(PET), on the other hand, are bulky and provide only ‘snapshot’ observations; they are not suitable 
for bedside applications3,4. In contrast, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) offers non-invasive, 
continuous, high-temporal-resolution CBF index (CBFi) measurements at the bedside5. DCS 
analyzes light intensity fluctuations caused by red blood cell movement using the autocorrelation 
function (ACF), given by 𝑔𝑔2 = 〈𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡)𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡+ 𝜏𝜏)〉/〈𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡)〉2, to assess blood flow dynamics6,7. 
Over the past two decades, DCS has evolved from continuous-wave (CW-DCS) to time-domain 
(TD-DCS) and frequency-domain (FD-DCS) variants8,9. Analytical models for complex tissue 
structures have advanced from semi-infinite homogeneous medium to two-layer and the three-
layer models10,11. These developments have expanded DCS applications in brain health evaluation, 
neurovascular studies, cancer diagnosis, and therapy evaluation3. 
Traditionally, DCS maps measured 𝑔𝑔2 curves to the semi-infinite model, allowing real-time CBFi 
measurements12. However, this model underestimates CBFi and is susceptible to extracerebral 
layer interference13. Attempts to improve CBFi sensitivity by fitting 𝑔𝑔2 at short correlation times 
with the semi-infinite analytical model or increasing the source-detector separation (ρ) often 
reduce signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and lead to inaccurate CBFi estimates14. There is a trade-off 
between the detection depth and SNR15. While advanced DCS variants such as pathlength-resolved 
DCS or TD-DCS can mitigate this issue, their complexity limits widespread adoption16,17. 
Multichannel DCS (MDCS) improves SNR by an order of magnitude, enabling deeper blood flow 
measurement18,19. For example, the ATLAS SPAD sensor developed by the University of 
Edinburgh achieves ρ~5 cm20. In addition, the two-layer and three-layer analytical models enhance 
CBFi sensitivity and enable separation of cerebral and extracerebral blood flow but require 
multiple predefined parameters for fitting (e.g., layer thickness and optical properties). If these 
parameters are mis-specified, significant errors may occur21–23. Additionally, these models are 
computationally intensive, limiting real-time application24. Integrating MDCS with multi-layer 
analytical models could enable more accurate CBFi estimation. However, advanced data 
processing techniques are required to overcome the existing limitations. 
Deep learning (DL) has emerged as an efficient technique for DCS data processing in multiple 
studies25–29. It has demonstrated improved speed and robustness compared to traditional curve-
fitting approaches24,25. For example, Poon et al. achieved 23-fold speed improvement25, and Li et 
al. showed LSTM could improve BFi accuracy27. Nakabayashi et al. did explore an LSTM to 
separate shallow vs deep flow in a two-layer flow phantom, underlining the community’s interest 
in accounting for layers30. However, to date these DL models have been trained mostly on the 
semi-infinite homogeneous (single-layer) analytical data, Monte Carlo simulations, or phantom 
experimental data, which are not suitable for CBFi recovery. To our knowledge, no prior 
publication has utilized training data from the two-layer DCS analytical model. The two-layer 
analytical model can accurately recover CBFi and relative CBFi (rCBFi) than the semi-infinite 
model while requiring fewer parameters than the three-layer model22, making it an ideal candidate 
for training dataset generation.
