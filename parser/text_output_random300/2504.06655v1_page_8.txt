Where, Zve is the valence of the ions, C electrolyte concentration, σ surface charge density, ε 
is the dielectric constant of the bulk solvent. 
Hence the effective static electric field is given by EDC(z) = − d  Φ(z) where Φ(z) = Φ0e−κz. 
Where κ−1 = λ = Debye length. 
Again the oriented solvent molecules near the surface having particular alignment and the 
decaying electrostatic potential give rise to interference effects on the light interactions from the 
different layers of interface, modulating the overall coherence length of the processes (Fig. 1 b). 
So the optical field is dependent on the depth (z) from the surface and the phase mismatch for 
the nlo processes due to the optical dispersion and is given by ∆kz = |k1z + k2z − ksig,z|. Where

Recently people have tried to untwine the dynamic and the static part with the variation of 
both κ and the phase of mismatch ∆kz. Ohono etal have employed the Heterodyne detected SHG 
having control over the phase mismatch and applied different ionic strength to extract the static 
contribution as a function of the phase angle ϕ, as given by equation 6).54 The static contribution to 
the total nonlinear polarization SHG/SFG signal is controlled by both the electrical developments 
and phase-matching consequences, which is given below by Ohono etal.18,54
