Approximation to the hybridization matrix
elements
A given interlayer hybridization matrix element be-
tween two atomic sites is given by the overlap of their
local atomic orbital wavefunctions. Besides the orbital
character, it depends on the distance between the two
sites and can be roughly parametrized by a decaying
function
V (d) = V [az
d ]ζe−|d−az|/ξ .
(A29)
As explained in the main text, we could choose V = V1
as a single tuning parameter for a given distance d, while
ζ and ξ are simply implemented by some cutoﬀschemes.
The cutoﬀscheme we adopted here assumes that the
hybridization element decays smoothly and vanishes be-
yond some chosen cutoﬀsphere. For this purpose, we use
the following function form for the parameterization
V (d) = V θ(dcutoff −d)( dcutoff −d
dcutoff −az
)2 ,
(A30)
with θ(x) being the step function, and dcutoff ∼ξ the
radius of the cutoﬀsphere, which could be
dcutoff =
q
a2z + a2
0
(A31)
when the cutoﬀradius is within the nearest neighboring
(NN) sites on each layer, or
dcutoff =
q
a2z + 3a2
0
(A32)
when the cutoﬀradius is within the next nearest neigh-
boring (NNN) sites, or some other values. This function
can be considered as an approximation to the above expo-
nential decay function. A comparison between diﬀerent
cutoﬀradius is shown in the ﬁgures (Fig. 10 and Fig.
11) with ζ = 2.

Solve the four-band model
Let H4×4,kσ be 4 × 4 Hamiltonian matrix with eigen-
value x. By requiring that
det(yI4×4 −H4×4,kσ) = 0 ,
(B1)
we have
y4 + by3 + cy2 + dy + e = 0 ,

with the coeﬃcients being deﬁned as
