Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are highly sought after because of their ability to host non-
abelian anyons, whose braiding statistics make them excellent candidates for qubits in topological
quantum computing. Multiple theoretical studies on the ν = 12
5 FQH state predict various quasi-
particle states hosted by the 12
5 plateau, which include Z3 parafermions and Majorana modes. In this
work, we provide a systematic protocol to distinguish among four possible candidate wavefunctions
of the
12
5 plateau using zero-frequency short noise experiments on a filter-geometry. Qualitative
comparisons of Fano-Factors provide a robust way to predict the candidate state across both the full
and partial thermal equilibration regimes without prior knowledge of the experimental information,
like thermal equilibration length, to allow for more realistic experiments.

INTRODUCTION
In the modern history of condensed matter physics,
the quantum Hall effect and fractional quantum Hall ef-
fect have a remarkable contribution [1–4]. This was our
first known example of a topological insulator [5]. The
fractional quantum Hall effect produces one of the most
natural playgrounds of strong interaction in a topolog-
ical setting. Since its discovery, one new aspect of the
two-dimensional system was proposed, namely anyons
which was unseen before [6].
These anyons can be of
two types — 1) abelian (seen in most common frac-
tions like 1/3, 2/3, etc.), 2) non-abelian anyons (pro-
posed to be seen in fractions like 5/2, 12/5, etc.) [7, 8].
Among the two most studied fillings corresponding to
non-abelian excitations, 5/2 has been proposed to have
Majorana modes [9], and 12/5 has been proposed to have
parafermions [10, 11]. In the recent interest of quantum
computing, these provide a playground to create quan-
tum qubits and gates. It has been proposed that 5/2 can
help to create a NOT gate, and 12/5 can be used to cre-
ate any universal gate [12]. However, this first requires
the identification of the bulk state. There has been quite
some work for the 5/2 case. In this work, we extend the
idea of Ref. [13] in 5/2 for 12/5 and provide an exact
protocol for the experimentalist to decode the bulk state
purely by electrical noise measurements.
Though we discuss the principles for the conventional
two-dimensional electron gas here, this idea can be ex-
tended to graphene and its sister materials.
In recent
times, due to its extreme controllability, we can now
see more fractions [14–17] that were invisible in the case
of 2DEG. This protocol can provide insights into those
states, too.

Details on the ν = 12/5 FQH state
One of the most prominent candidates for a topological
qubit is ν = 12/5. This is because there are predictions
of one of the possible states to hold what are called the
Fibonacci anyons [19]. However, as of now, the numer-
ical evidence is hardly prominent.
Though from prior
experiences with ν = 5/2 [20–31], one has to take the
limitations of the limited system size numerical calcula-
tions with a grain of salt. There are many candidates
for the 12/5 wavefunction, but we will focus on only 4 of
