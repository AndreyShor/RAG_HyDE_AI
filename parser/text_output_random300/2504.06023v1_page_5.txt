FIG. 2. The pairwise potentials ν(r, 1) (black in the top) generated
by a unit charge at the origin and its difference from the Coulomb
potential, ν(r, 1) −1/r (red at the bottom) along three typical direc-
tions: r = sL(1, 0, 0) (solid lines), r = sL(1, 1, 0) (dashed lines),
and r = sL(1, 1, 1) (dot-dashed lines). Here, s is a dimensionless
variable and L = 1 is the length of the cubic box centered at the ori-
gin. Both potentials, νe3dtf(r, 1) (left) and νaa(r, 1) (right), exhibit
flattening near the surface of the box. Similar behaviors can be found
for νcd(r, L) in the Appendix.
and (21)] and real [Eqs. (12) and (16)] spaces. These com-
plementary representations facilitate the concise derivation of
exact results through algebraic operations such as substitution,
differentiation, and integration. The interactions νe3dtf(r, L),
νaa(r, L) and νcd(r, L) share several fundamental properties
that collectively characterize electrostatic systems with PBC.
For simplicity, we will henceforth use ν(r, L) to generically
denote any of these interactions—νe3dtf(r, L), νaa(r, L), or
νcd(r, L)—with specific distinctions provided where neces-
sary.
(i) Symmetry and Positivity. ν(r, L) is even and strictly
positive,
ν(r, L) = ν(−r, L) > 0
∀r ∈R3.
(22)
The positivity of ν(r, L) imply that the effective interaction
retains the long-range nature of the bare Coulomb interaction.
As is well known, this long-range Coulomb interaction leads
to the divergence of the electrostatic energy for a homoge-
neous non-neutral system in the thermodynamic limit.
(ii) Lattice Periodicity.
The interaction exhibits discrete
translational symmetry,
ν(r, L) = ν(r + nL, L)
∀n ∈Z3.
(23)
Consequently, for any r ∈R3, there exists a minimum image
rm ∈[−L/2, L/2]3 such that,
ν(rm, L) = ν(r, L),
(24)
which allows mapping any interaction to the case where the
source charge is located at the center of the primary cell and
the target point lies within the cell.
(iii) Dominance over the Coulomb interaction.
ν(r, L) ⩾1/r
∀r ∈R3.
(25)
By property (ii), it suffices to verify this relation for r ∈
[−L/2, L/2]3. Fig 2 reveals that the difference, ν(r, L)−1/r,
along typical directions approaches 0 at r →0 and reaches its
maximum at the surface of the primary cell.
(iv) Cancellation of Electric Field.
The electric field at
r = (x, y, z) in the x, y, or z direction vanishes at the sur-
face normal to the direction,
−ex · ∇ν(r, L) = 0
for
x = ±L/2,
(26)
with analogous relations for y and z. This cancellation of the
electric field can be rigorously proved using the Fourier-space
expressions given in Eqs. (5), (17) and (21). It implies the
symmetric arrangement of charges around the target point in
one or more particular directions.
(v) Constant Average Potential.

τ([νcd]) = τcd. (28)
This constancy originates from the orthogonality of Fourier
series. Specifically, the integral of any non-constant trigono-
metric function (e.g. sin(2πn1x/L) or cos(2πn1x/L)) over
any length of the period L vanishes identically,

and

leaving only the constant component in the Fourier expan-
sion of ν(r, L) [Eqs. (5), (17) and (21)]. In the context of
the symmetry-preserving mean-field theory, Eq. (29) enables
systematic reduction of degrees of freedom while preserving
the intrinsic symmetries of the system[15, 16].

Eqs. (27) and (30) offer clear physical interpretations of the
constant τ([ν]). ξ/L represents either the bulk potential av-
eraged over the primary cell, generated by a unit point charge
located at an arbitrary position, or the bulk potential at an arbi-
trary point, generated by a uniform charge density 1/V , under
PBC. The other two constants, 9/(5rs) and τcd, follow analo-
gously.
