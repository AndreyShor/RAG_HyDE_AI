The rightmost formula above introduces an integral symplectic basis of periods {FI, XI} that can
be computed by integrating the holomorphic three form of X along an integral symplectic basis
{AI, BI} of three-cycles on X:
FI =
Z
BI
Ω(φ),
XI =
Z
AI Ω(φ).

Special geometry implies [27, 61] that the FI can be expressed as derivatives of the genus 0 B-model
free energy F, which is a function of the conjugate periods XI.
Higher genus B-model free energies F(g) can be computed by solving the holomorphic anomaly
equations [38, 39]. Higher genus A-model free energies, by the Gopakumar-Vafa formula [57, 58],
encode the higher genus GV invariants n(g)

Here c(t) is the polynomial part of the genus 0 free energy (3.20). l(t) = −c2
24t is the classical part
of the genus 1 free energy (which is only defined up to an additive constant).
By using the solution approach to the holomorphic anomaly equations developed in [34], and then
applying (3.13) and comparing with (3.24), it becomes possible to compute the n(g)
k
to as high a
genus as available boundary data allows. The boundary data coming from the gap behaviour at the
three conifold points, plus the constant term in the expansion about φ = 0, plus the Castelnuovo
vanishing of the invariants n(g)
β
of Y , are sufficient for us to compute A-model topological string free
energies for Y up to genus 4. We display the resulting n(g)
β
in the first row of Table 2, Appendix §B.

N > 1 MUM points
It can happen that there is no choice of κ111 and c2 such that there is an integral basis of solutions as
described in the previous N = 1 discussion, under the assumption that the same Euler characteristic
should be attached to all MUM points within a common moduli space. Moreover, the n(g)
k
prescribed
in (3.24) may not be integers. This phenomenon has been addressed in [2], and later in [4] where
the authors study the possibility that the mirror geometry X associated to a MUM point is not
smooth. Instead, to a MUM point one can associate a singular threefold X with some number of
nodal singularities, together with a topologically nontrivial flat B-field which obstructs the complex
structure deformations that would remove these singularities.
These singularities have the property that there is no global resolution that is Calabi-Yau and
K¨ahler. The article [4] considers resolutions b
X which are Calabi-Yau, non-K¨ahler, and have ex-
ceptional curves which are torsional.
On b
X, the B-field is a two-form valued in H2( b
X, U(1)).
It is explained in [4] that the distinct choices of such a flat B-field are labelled by the ele-
ments of H3( b
X, Z)Torsion ∼= H2( b
X, Z)Torsion.
The authors of [4] consider the A-model topolog-
ical string on backgrounds ( b
X, [k]), where b
X is a non-K¨ahler resolution, with vanishing first
