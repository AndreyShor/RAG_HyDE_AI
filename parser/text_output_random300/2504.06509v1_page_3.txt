further reveal an inverse relationship between voltage amplitude and pulse width for durations 
below 1 ns—analogous to the super-threshold regime in STT switching—indicating a voltage-
induced precessional switching mechanism. We observe that smaller devices exhibit more 
efficient switching, which is further supported by macrospin simulations. The simulations 
indicate that the switching is primarily driven by a voltage-induced damping-like torque. In 
smaller devices, the coupled layer exhibits a stronger dynamic response, leading to faster 
energy dissipation in the free layer. This manifests as an effective increase in damping, 
providing a possible explanation for the improved switching efficiency observed 
experimentally.
