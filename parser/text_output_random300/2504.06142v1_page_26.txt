From SO(2,16) to the Standard Model
In this section four distinct models that begin from the SO(2, 16) ∼SO(18) gauge group
and result in the SM are examined, as well as their observation potential in experiments that
search for gravitational wave signals and proton decay.
7.1
Field content and estimation of scales of spontaneous symme-
try breakings
First, we determine (following [60]) the full field content of the initial SO(18) gauge theory,
from which we ultimately obtain EG and SO(10) × [U(1)]global.
We follow the breaking
directions and necessary field content employed in [85], in order to finally result in the SM.
More specifically, SO(10) breaks into an intermediate gauge group, which in turn breaks
into the SM group. The intermediate gauge groups are the Pati-Salam, SU(4)C × SU(2)L ×
SU(2)R, with or without a discrete left-right symmetry, D and the minimal left-right group,
SU(3)C ×SU(2)L ×SU(2)R ×U(1)B−L, with or without a discrete left-right symmetry. From
now on, we denote them 422, 422D, 3221 and 3221D, respectively. Naturally, we have four
different field contents at the SO(18) level, one for each specific lower-energy model.
As explained in detail in the previous section, SO(18) breaks into SO(6) × SO(12) by
the (1, 1) of a scalar 170 rep, while we choose scalars in the 15 rep of SO(6) to break the
CG group, which can be drawn from the SO(18) rep 153:
153 = (15, 1) + (6, 12) + (1, 66) ,
(129)
The SO(12) gauge group is broken (spontaneously) by scalars in the 77 rep, which can result
from a 170 rep of the parent group. Therefore, in SO(6) × SO(12) notation, the scalars
responsible for the breakings of the two groups belong to (15, 1) and (1, 77). In order to
have fermions in the 16 rep of SO(10), we need three copies of a 256 rep of SO(18) (which
will result in the 16 through (4, 32) in SO(6) × SO(12) notation). The SO(10) GUT is
broken by a scalar in the 210 rep into the 422 and the 3221D gauge groups, by a scalar in
the 54 rep into the 422D gauge group and by a scalar in the 45 rep into the 3221 gauge
group.
All intermediate gauge groups break spontaneously into the SM with scalars in a 126
rep and the electroweak Higgs boson is accommodated in a 10 rep5 (stil in SO(10) lan-
guage). From now on, the scale at which the SO(10) gauge group breaks will be called
GUT scale, MGUT, As the gauge couplings unify at that scale, while the scale at which the
422(D)/3221(D) groups break will be called intermediate scale, MI. The respective breakings
are given below:
5In order for the Higgs boson to be in a 10 rep instead of a 120 and to avoid an additional Yukawa term,
a U(1) Peccei-Quinn symmetry must be taken into account [85]. This could be identified with the global
U(1) of SO(10) × [U(1)]global, which also breaks at the unification scale. For the purposes of the present
study this global U(1) will be ignored from now on.
