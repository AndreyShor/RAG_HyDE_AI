This provides us with the refined invariants up to genus 4 listed in tables Table 3 and Table 4.
Proceeding beyond genus 4
We can go further, and obtain the rest of the invariants in our three tables Table 2, Table 3, and
Table 4. To do this we need additional boundary conditions, as the constraints we have imposed
so far do not allow us to go beyond genus 4. With our identification of Xdef, we can impose new
constraints in expansions about the MUM point Ï• = 0.
The first of these is Castelnuovo vanishing of the refined invariants n(g)
Î²,k. The authors of [4] identified
that the refined invariants they computed vanished unless g â‰¤gdef
Castelnuovo(Î²), where

(A.31)
It may be the case that more generally a stronger bound holds for Î² < Îº(Xdef)
111
, as in the top line
of (A.13). Deriving such a formula through the use of PT-GV relations and wall crossing formula
[85â€“91], as carried out in [82] to obtain (A.13), would be of great interest. This is a moot point for
our example, as Îº(Xdef)
111
= 2 is too small for an equation like the top line in (A.13) to provide any
new constraints beyond genus 4.
Incorporating (A.31) as additional boundary data allows us to expand to genus 10. For genus 11
we need one additional boundary datum. For this, we will use the constant term (3.39).
In fact, we wish to draw attention to the fact that the expansions at genera 5 to 10 that result from
including (A.31) have the constant terms (3.39), without us imposing this on the expansions. Al-
though seeing integral invariants is reassuring, it is certainly possible in several examples of compact
CY3 to make mistakes in the topological string computations so as to produce incorrect invariants
that are nonetheless integral. However, reproducing the precise rational numbers prescribed by
(3.39) serves as a nontrivial check on our work. We also propose that this justifies our assumption
of Castelnuovo vanishing in the Ï• = 0 expansion, and further we propose that this serves as a
justification of our use of the top line in (A.13) as boundary data in the Ï† = 0 expansions.
To illustrate this point, we display the explicit constant terms for genera 2 to 11 predicted by (3.39):
