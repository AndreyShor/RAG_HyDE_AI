Many open questions remain regarding
the transition to immiscibility (Papp et al., 2008), the
dynamics of phase separation, and the formation of
composite topological structures such as massive vortices
(Richaud et al., 2021, 2020). This section discusses these
potential directions, focusing on the interplay between
nonlinear interactions, inter-component coupling, and
hydrodynamic instabilities.
A two-component quantum fluid of light consists of two
interacting optical fields that propagate through a non-
linear medium, behaving analogously to a binary Bose-
Einstein condensate (Baroni et al., 2024). One possible
implementation is to use the polarization degree of free-
dom. Indeed, when deriving the NLSE in Section II.A, we
considered a linearly polarized field hence neglecting the
tensorial nature of the third-order susceptibility. How-
ever, if we consider the more general case of an ellip-
tically polarized beam, still propagating in an isotropic
medium, then the atomic polarization is given by (Boyd,
2008):
P = 6ε0χ1122(E · E∗)E + 3ε0χ1221(E · E)E∗.
(116)
We decompose the electric field in the circular polar-
ization basis: E = E+ˆσ+ + E−ˆσ−, where ˆσ+ (resp. ˆσ−)
is the unitary circular left (resp. right) vector. Then the
nonlinear susceptibility can be rewritten as
P = P+ˆσ+ + P−ˆσ−
(117)
where P± = ε0χ±E±, with
χ± = A|E±|2 + (A + B)|E∓|2,
(118)
with A = 6χ1122 and B = 6χ1221.
Injecting this ex-
pression into the Helmholtz propagation equation, one
finds that in the paraxial approximation, the evolution
of the envelopes of the two circular polarization compo-
nents, E+ and E−, is described by two coupled nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equations (CNLSE):
i∂zE± =

−∇2
⊥
2k0
+ g|E±|2 + g12|E∓|2

E±,
(119)
where g = −k0A is the intra-component interaction co-
efficient, g12 = −k0(A + B) is the inter-component in-
teraction coefficient. We have neglected absorption out
of simplicity. Similarly as for the single-component case,
these equations are formally equivalent to the coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations governing binary Bose mix-
tures, with the propagation coordinate z playing the role
of time (Pethick and Smith, 2008).
The sign and relative weight of g and g12 determine the
accessible interaction regime of the system (Pitaevskii
and Stringari, 2016). g > 0 (resp. g < 0) implies re-
pulsive (resp.
attractive) intra-component interaction,
and similarly, g12 > 0 (resp. g12 < 0) implies repulsive
(resp. attractive) inter-component interaction. The fluid
is stable against collapse as long as the total resulting
interaction is repulsive. Then, if g > |g12| > 0, the two
components are miscible and they remain homogeneously
mixed. If g12 > |g| > 0, the system is non-miscible and
undergoes phase separation, leading to spontaneous do-
main formation.
1. Spin and density modes in the miscible regime
In the miscible regime, it has been predicted that two-
component fluids of light support two distinct collective
modes (Martone et al., 2021; Martone and Cherroret,
2023), the density and the spin mode, just like two-
component BECs (Cominotti et al., 2022; Pethick and
Smith, 2008).
The density mode corresponds to exci-
tations of the sum of the densities of the two compo-
nents, and the spin mode to excitations of the difference
of the densities of the two components. They correspond
to two distinct branches of dispersion, both having a
Bogolioubov shape but with different speeds of sound.
Recent experiments have demonstrated a miscible two-
component fluid of light using a red-detuned laser from
the D1 line of rubidium 87, and have observed the two
branches of dispersions (see Fig. 20), with the density
speed of sound

|E|2,
(120)
and the spin speed of sound
c2
s = g −g12
2k0
|E|2,
(121)
where |E|2 = |E+|2 +|E−|2. Interestingly, two-component
fluids of light have also provided a novel effect compared
to two-component BECs:
an inversion of the relative
value of the two sound velocities due to interaction terms
beyond two-body contact interactions. As described in
Section V.A.2, higher order terms in the nonlinear atomic
response will lead to a saturation and a decrease of the
effective photon-photon interactions. In two-component
fluids this leads to an unconventional inversion of the
two speeds of sound, which mimics attractive interactions
between the two species. This novel degree of freedom
should open interesting directions in the study of fluid-
mixture hydrodynamics with light.
2. Non-miscible regime and coarsening dynamics
When g12 > g, the spin mode becomes imaginary, lead-
ing to an instability that drives the separation of the
two components. This transition gives rise to a coarsen-
ing dynamics, a topic that remains largely unexplored in
