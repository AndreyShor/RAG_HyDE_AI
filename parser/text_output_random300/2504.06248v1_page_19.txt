Altogether, by returning to the original variables, the joint invariants of L−1, L0 and L1 are such that
η(z) = ρc(1 −ρd)

that is, the joint invariants are cross-ratios.
If the cross-ratios are not known to be conserved in the Kuramoto model a priori, the presented procedure provides
a systematic way to construct them from the Koopman generator. Clearly, for n = N, this means that the cross-ratios
are constants of motion for identical oscillators with generator K = p(z)L−1 + iωL0 −p(z)L1. Yet, it is also true in
more general cases where 4 ≤n < N and K = PN
j,k=1(Ajkzk −¯Ajk¯zkz2
j )∂j: the requirements to conserve a cross-ratio
are stated in Thm. 2 (Thm. S12). Before getting to the proof of Thm. 2 (Thm. S12), we present a lemma on the
functional independence of cross-ratios.
C.
Functional independence of cross-ratios
In this subsection, to make the presentation more self-contained, we demonstrate a known result (e.g., Ref. [61,
Example 2.35] or Appendix of Ref. [62]) about the functional independence of cross-ratios using the classical criterion
on the rank of a Jacobian matrix [60, Theorem 2.16]. We will use the result not only for globally coupled oscillators
(n = N), but for any subgraph of 4 ≤n < N vertices with a certain number of functionally independent cross-ratios.
Each cross-ratio cabcd depends on four indices {a, b, c, d} with a, b, c, d ∈{1, ..., n}, where the order of the indices a,
b, c, and d may change the cross-ratio. Since there are n!/(n −4)! (falling factorial (n)4) ways to select an ordered
list of 4 distinct elements from a set of n items (number of 4-permutations in a set of size n), there are n!/(n −4)!
cross-ratios. Yet, only some of them are independent as stated in the next lemma.
Lemma S6. Among the n!/(n −4)! cross-ratios cabcd such that a, b, c, d ∈{1, ..., n} with a ̸= b ̸= c ̸= d, only n −3
cross-ratios form a functionally independent set, such as
{c1234, c2345, ..., c(n−3)(n−2)(n−1)n} .
(S45)
Proof. A large portion of the proof is taken from Ref. [62]. First, it is straightforward to show that all cross-ratios
with permutations of the same 4 indices are functionally dependent. For a given cross-ratio cabcd,
cbadc(z) = cabcd(z) ;
(S46)
ccdab(z) = cabcd(z) ;
(S47)
cdcba(z) = cabcd(z) ;
(S48)
cabdc(z) =
1
cabcd(z) ;
(S49)
cacbd(z) = 1 −cabcd(z) ;
(S50)
cacdb(z) =
1
cacbd(z) =
1
1 −cabcd(z)
by Eqs. (S49-S50) ;
(S51)
cadcb(z) = 1 −cacdb(z) = 1 −
1
1 −cabcd(z) =
cabcd(z)
cabcd(z) −1
by Eqs. (S50-S51) ;
(S52)
cadbc(z) =
1
cadcb(z) = cabcd(z) −1
cabcd(z)
by Eqs. (S49-S52) .
(S53)
The 15 other permutations can be obtained by permuting the indices of the cross-ratios in Eqs. (S49-S53) according
to Eqs. (S46-S48). Thus, cross-ratios with all 24 permutations of the same 4 indices are functionally dependent. For
the rest of the proof, permutations can therefore be omitted without loss of generality.
Next, demonstrate the functional independence of the n −3 cross-ratios
{c1234, c2345, ..., c(n−3)(n−2)(n−1)n} .
Consider the function ζ : Tn 7→Rn−3 defined as
ζ(z) = (c1234(z), c2345(z), ..., c(n−3)(n−2)(n−1)n(z)) .
