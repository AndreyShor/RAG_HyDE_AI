Kelvin temperatures, it becomes crucial to differentiate between the hysteresis in resistance
occurring due to intrinsic magnetic ordering and the possible impact of change in resistance
due to a rise and fall of the effective temperature of the sample itself facilitated extrinsically
by the continuous sweep of the magnetic field, intrinsic to the sample holder, influencing the
experimental results. Thus, observation of hysteresis in resistance to the magnetic field in
‘twisted’ mesoscopic devices requires careful deliberation to uncover the exact intrinsic or
extrinsic nature to infer any meaningful conclusion.
In this letter, we present an experimental study on the observation of hysteresis in lon-
gitudinal resistance (Rxx) under an in-plane magnetic field (B||) in a near magic-angle TBG
(θ = 0.95◦) that hosts a superconducting (SC) phase when it is electron-doped to a moir´e
filling factor of ν ∼2 −3.24 This hysteresis phase is largely prominent around the SC phase,
with Rxx hysteresis vanishing deep inside the superconducting region.
Additionally, the
hysteresis phase is recovered once superconductivity is diminished, as seen with increased
temperature around superconducting critical temperature, Tc.24 We have found that the
magnitude of reduced magnetoresistance (rMR) and coercive fields strongly depends on how
rapidly (ramp-rate, dB/dt) the magnetic field is cycled through a closed loop. Also, Rxx is
found to have a transient relaxation profile in a ‘time-series’ experiment. Compared with
an independently calibrated temperature sensor similarly mounted to the sample stage, we
find a similar hysteresis behavior under the applied magnetic field in the temperature of
the sample stage itself that matches qualitatively in an analogous fashion with that of the
near magic-angle TBG. Our results suggest that the observed hysteresis in Rxx(B||) could
be due to the result of an extrinsic effect guided by the change in the temperature profile of
the sample stage subjected to the continuous change of the magnetic field, and indicates a
