Local structure of extremal points

We also observe that thanks to (4.9), on the event Ek, there exists a constant c > 0 such that
{M0,k(Υk,g) ≤λ −c(log k)2} ⊆{M0,k(Υb,g) ≤λ} .
Therefore, the right-hand side of (4.23) can be lower bounded by the following probability
P0,u,b

M0,k(Υk,g) ≤λ −c(log k)2, Ek,
b−1
\
j=k
{Bj ≥λ + Rk(j)}

.
We note that the first event inside the above probability is conditionally independent from the second
and third events given σ(Bk). In particular, the conditional probability of the first event given
{Bk = z}, for some z ≥λ + Rk(k), increases as z increases. Therefore, it can bounded from below
by a constant c1(k) > 0.
Since by definition {Kb ≤k} ⊆Ek, to conclude it suffices to estimate the following probability
P0,u,b

Kb ≤k,
b−1
\
j=k
{Bj ≥λ + Rk(j)}

.
(4.24)
To this end, by using Lemma 4.10, we get that there exist constants c2, c3 > 0 such that
P0,u,b

Kb > k,
b−1
\
j=k
{Bj ≥λ + Rk(j)}

≤c2e−c3(log k)2 u
b ,
and so, the probability in (4.24) can be lower bounded by the following sum
P0,u,b
b−1
\
j=k
{Bj ≥λ + Rk(j)}

−c2e−c3(log k)2 u
b .
Furthermore, by using the lower bound in (A.2) and Lemma A.11, we get that the above probability is
lower bounded by
P0,u,b
b−1
\
j=1
{Bj ≥−λ −Rk(j)},
b−1
\
j=k
{Bj ≥λ + Rk(j)}

for some constant c4 > 0. Hence, putting everything together, we showed that there exist constants
c1(k), c2, c3, c4 > 0 such that
P0,u,b(M0,b(Υb,g) ≤λ) ≥c1(k)u
b (c4(1 −k−1
16 ) −c2e−c3(log k)2) ,
from which the claim follows.
We finish this subsection with the following lemma.
