Thus, the final SREM energy for the three-parameter ansatz is given by
ESREM
JKL
= EEM
JKL +(E

JKL −EJKL)

= EJKL +∆ref
JKL +(E

JKL −EJKL)
= (ESREM

This completes the mitigation process for the three-parameter circuit and ESREM
JKL
is used as noiseless energy for training in
GNM model. The noisy energy Enoisy
JKL for three parameter circuit which is used as training data for GNM model is obtained by
optimizing all three parameters θJ, θK and θL starting from the initial point zero.
Enoisy
JKL = ⟨φHF|e−τJ(θJ)e−τK(θK)e−τL(θL) ˆHeτL(θL)eτK(θK)eτJ(θJ) |φHF⟩(initial −point = [0,0,0])

The detailed algorithm for the SREM technique is shown in Fig. S1.
Fig. S2: The energy error relative to the noiseless value is plotted for both noisy and SREM energies across various
snippet circuit combinations. The pink region corresponds to the one-parameter circuit, the light yellow region
represents the two-parameter circuit, and the white region denotes the three-parameter circuit. The mitigated
expectation values show larger spread as one moves from one to two to three parameter snippet circuits.
