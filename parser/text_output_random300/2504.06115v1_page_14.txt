The Weil-Petersson metric on the moduli space is then given by Gz¯z = ∂z∂¯zK.
We will now assume that the limit z →0 corresponds to a point of maximally unipotent
monodromy (MUM-point) that is mirror to the large volume limit t →i∞on (X, [k]N). One
can then choose a basis of rational 3-cycles on Wk such that the corresponding periods of
Ω(z) take the form
Π′(z) =





̟0(z)
̟0(z) log(z) + ̟1(z)
̟0(z) log(z)2 + 2̟1(z) log(z) + ̟2(z)
̟0(z) log(z)3 + 3̟1(z) log(z)2 + 3̟2(z) log(z) + ̟3(z)

in terms of locally analytic functions ̟0(z) = 1 + O(z) and ̟i(z) = O(z) for i = 1, 2, 3. We
refer to ̟0(z) as the fundamental period and it is a section of L.
As a consequence of Griﬃths transversality, the holomorphic 3-form – and therefore also
the periods – are annihilated by the so-called Picard-Fuchs operator
D =
4
X
i=0
pi(z)θi ,
θ = z∂z .
(3.8)
The coeﬃcients pi(z), i = 0, . . . , 4 are polynomials in z. The Picard-Fuchs operator can be
reconstructed from the fundamental period ̟0(z) by making an ansatz for D and solving
D̟0(z) = 0.
For a suitable choice of coordinate z, the mirror map that relates this to the complexiﬁed
K¨ahler parameter t of (X, [k]N) is given by
t(z) =
1
2πi

log(z) + ̟1(z)
̟0(z)

(3.9)
The mirror map can be inverted around z = 0 to obtain the inverse mirror map z(t).
One can then choose an integral symplectic basis of 3-cycles

AI · BJ = −BJ · AI = δI

in terms of a prepotential F(t). The appearance of the factor of N has ﬁrst been observed
in [15, 16], for N = 2, and we generalize the results here for arbitrary N.
As was also discussed in [15, 16], generalizing the well known results for N = 1 from [1–3],
the prepotential F(t) takes the form
F(t) = −κ
