SINGULARITY AND REGULARITY OF THE CRITICAL 2D SHF

More precisely, denoting by rrxss the point in Z2
even closest to x P R2, the following convergence
in distribution was proved in [CSZ23a, Theorem 1.1]: for any t ą 0

which are regarded as random variables taking values in the space of locally finite measures
on R2 equipped with the vague topology, i.e., the one generated by the integrals

φ dµ for
continuous and compactly supported test functions φ : R2 Ñ R.
We strengthen this result to a convergence in distribution of random variables taking
values in negative Hölder spaces C´ε for any ε ą 0.
Theorem 1.7 (Improved convergence to the SHF). Fix ϑ P R and consider βcrit

the critical regime (1.19). For any t ą 0, the following convergence in distribution holds:

This result directly implies Theorem 1.5 on the regularity of the SHF. The proof is given in
Section 3 by exploiting moment bounds from [CSZ23a] (see Proposition 3.7).
We next look back at the log-normality of the SHF averaged on vanishing balls as ϑ Ñ ´8,
see Theorem 1.2. We obtain this result via discrete approximations, namely we deduce it
from an analogue result for directed polymer partition functions, which we state next.
In order to compare the SHF as ϑ Ñ ´8 with directed polymers, we need to tune the
disorder strength β in a quasi-critical regime recently investigated in [CCR23], where we
replace ϑ in (1.19) by a sequence ϑN “ ´|ϑN| Ñ ´8 at an arbitrarily slow rate:
σ2
βquasi-crit
N
:“

1 ´ |ϑN|
log N
˙
where 1 ! |ϑN| ! log N .
(1.22)
We call this regime quasi-critical because it interpolates between the critical regime (1.19),
corresponding to |ϑN| “ Op1q, and the sub-critical regime [CSZ17, CSZ20, CC22, CD24],
corresponding to |ϑN| « log N, see (1.26) below.
Let us consider directed polymer partition functions Zβ
Npφq with initial conditions φ that
are uniformly distributed on discrete balls, denoted by UBpz,Rq (same as their continuum
counterparts (1.8), with some abuse of notation):

We can now state our log-normality result for directed polymers.
Theorem 1.8 (Quasi-critical log-normality). Consider βquasi-crit

regime (1.22) for a given sequence 1 ! |ϑN| ! log N. Define the scale δN by
