A representative QCD LO Feynman diagram is shown in Fig. 1.3; we observe that this process is
mainly driven by the q¯q or qq channels for NC and CC providing additional sensitivity to the
quark flavor separation.
Jet and Dijet production.
Inclusive single jet and dijet production, Fig. 1.4, are among
the processes with the largest cross-section in hadron-hadron collisions. They involve the
reconstruction of one or two jets originated by any hard emission of q,¯q or g in the partonic

Here the characteristic scale of the process is given by the transverse momentum of the single
jet or dijet system which is related to the proton momentum fraction via:
