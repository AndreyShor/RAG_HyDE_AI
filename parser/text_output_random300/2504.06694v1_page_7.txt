deﬁned by ψ( uΩ
f p+1 ) := u is a bijection. In the proof of [3, Theorem 10.6] it is shown that the subspace
H0(P, ˆΩm
P(pX)) + dH0(P, ˆΩm−1
P
(pX)) ⊂H0(P, ˆΩm
P((p + 1)X))
maps via ψ to
J(f)pβ ⊂Spβ
for any p ≥0.
• Suppose p ≥m + 1. If
R(f)pβ = Spβ/J(f)pβ =
H0(P, ˆΩm
P((p + 1)X))
H0(P, ˆΩm
P(pX)) + dH0(P, ˆΩm−1
P
(pX))
were non-zero, then H0(P,ˆΩm
P ((p+1)X))
dH0(P,ˆΩm−1
P
(pX)) would be non-zero contributing non-trivially7 to Hm(P \
X), which contradicts the isomorphism (2.4).
• Suppose p = m. Then [3, Theorem 10.6] gives an isomorphism
R(f)mβ ∼= Gr0
F Hm(P \ X).
By [3, Corollary 10.12], there is a natural isomorphism
Gr0
F Hm(P \ X) ∼= H−1,m
pr
(X) = 0,
which implies that R(f)mβ = 0.

Corollary 2.7. Under the same assumption with Theorem 2.5, there is a graded vector space isomor-
phism (depending on Ω)
φΩ: A(f)
∼
=
−→Hm−1
pr
(X, C).
Now by Theorem 2.5, we have isomorphisms C ∼= R(f)0 ∼= Hm−1,0
pr
(X) and R(f)(m−1)β ∼= dimC H0,m−1
pr
(X).
Since dimC Hm−1,0
pr
(X) = dimC H0,m−1
pr
(X) by the Hodge symmetry, we conclude that dimC R(f)(m−1)β =
1. Thus there is an isomorphism R(f)(m−1)β
∼
=
−→C. We have the following analogue of Proposition 2.2.
Proposition 2.8. We further assume that X is a non-degenerate hypersurface in P (for example, see
[12, Deﬁnition 3.1]). There exists an isomorphism TrLG : R(f)(m−1)β
∼
=
−→C such that the following
diagram
R(f)aβ × R(f)bβ
R(f)(m−1)β
C
Hm−1−a,a
pr
(X) × Hm−1−b,b
pr
(X)
Hm−1,m−1
pr
(X)

TrLG

commutes, where
mul(u, v) = (−1)bu · v
for
u ∈R(f)aβ, v ∈R(f)bβ.
whenever a + b = m −1.8
For the proof, we will need Villaﬂor’s toric Carlson–Griﬃths theorem (see Theorem 3.5), so we defer
the proof to the end of Subsection 3.2; in particular, see (3.4) for an explicit deﬁnition of TrLG.
Now, motivated by Proposition 2.8, we deﬁne a bilinear pairing (analogous to the CY deﬁnition (2.2)
and Proposition 2.2)
R(f)aβ × R(f)bβ
mul
−−→R(f)(m−1)β
TrLG
−−−→C
by
⟨u, v⟩LG := TrLG(u · v)
7The de Rham complex of P with poles of arbitrary order along X has the pole order ﬁltration and this ﬁltered complex
is quasi-isomorphic to the de Rham complex of P \ X.
8Note that the bilinear map mul is symmetric (respectively, skew-symmetric) if m −1 is even (respectively, m −1 is
odd).
