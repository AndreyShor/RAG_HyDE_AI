]]S, T[[ = {(ω, t) ∈Ω× [0, ∞) | S(ω) < t < T(ω)}.
The set of semimartingales on a manifold M will be denoted by S (M). At times we will slightly abuse notation
and write Γt to refer to a semimartingale Γ. The lifetime of Γ will be denoted by ξΓ. For simplicity, unless
otherwise mentioned, semimartingales will be assumed to have infinite lifetime. Given a semimartingale Γ we let
Γ = Γ0 + MΓ + AΓ denote the Doob-Meyer decomposition of Γ, where MΓ is a local martingale and AΓ is a finite
variation process. Given a Borel set A in a manifold M and a semimartingale Γ, we define the first hitting
time for A as the random variable
τ h
A(Γ)(ω) = inf{t ∈[0, ∞]| Γ(ω) ∈A}
and the first exit time from A as the random variable
τ e
A(Γ)(ω) = inf{t ∈[0, ∞]| Γ(ω) /∈A}.
τ h
A(Γ) and τ e
A(Γ) are stopping times and they are predictable stopping times if A is a closed set (see, for example,
Emery [12]). If the process Γ is understood from context then we will use the notation τ h
A and τ e
A for first hitting
time and first exit time, respectively. We will also define τ (h,e)
A
(Γ) or τ (h,e)
A
to be τ e

If τ is a stopping time, we define the stopped process Γ|τ by Γ|τ
t (ω) = Γt∧T (ω)(ω), where t ∧T(ω) denotes the
minimum of t and T(ω), for all ω ∈Ω.
Given Γ ∈S (M) and a locally bounded predictable T ∗M-valued process Z over Γ (that is, Z projects to
Γ), the Stratonovich integral of Z along Γ is denoted by
R
Z ◦dΓ and the Itˆo integral of Z along Γ is denoted by
R
ZdIΓ. If α is a 1-form on M and Z = α(Γ) then
R
α ◦dΓ :=

Z ◦dΓ and

referred to Emery [12] for more details on Stratonovich and Itˆo integrals.
We will refer to Arnaudon and Thalamier [4] for the topology of semimartingales on S (M) and the topology
of uniform convergence on compacts in probability (ucp) on the space Dc(M) of M-valued continuous, adapted
processes. Endow Ck(M) with the topology of uniform convergence of compacts upto derivatives of order k.
Definition 2.1. Let M, N be smooth manifolds and E = Ck(M) × Dc(M) or Ck(M) × S (M) or Dc(M) or
S (M), and F = Dc(N) or S (N). A map ϕ : E →F is said to be lower semicontinuous if for every sequence
(Xn) in E converging to X ∈E, the sequence ϕ(Xn)|ξϕ(X)−converges to ϕ(X)
Remark 2.1. If we assume that semimartingales have infinite lifetime then ϕ is lower semicontinuous if and
only if ϕ is continuous.
For the proof of the next lemma we refer to Proposition 2.6 in [4].
Lemma 2.1.
1. The map
Ck(M) × Dc(M) →Dc(R)
(f, X) 7→f(X)
is lower semicontinous.
2. The maps
Ck(M) × S (M) →S (R)
(f, X) 7→f(X),
where k ≥2, and
S (Rn) →S (R)
X = (X1, · · · , Xn) 7→MXi or AXi or {MXi, MXj},
where {·, ·} denotes the quadratic variation, is lower semicontinous, are lower semicontinuous.
