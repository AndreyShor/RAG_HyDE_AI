experiments, anomalous Hall effect (AHE)/ferromagnetism and QAH states have already
been realized at moir´e filling factors of ν = 1, 2, 3 in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene

to hBN,19 twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBLG) proximitized to WSe2,20 twisted mono-
layer bilayer graphene21 and many more.
Owing to the vanishing spin-orbit coupling of graphene, the ferromagnetic order of spin
origin is not expected in the superlattice structures formed exclusively from graphene lay-
ers. As a result, the orbital component becomes the driving force behind the ferromagnetic
behavior observed in these moir´e platforms and is identified as ‘orbital magnetism’.5,21 The
AHE and orbital ordering are identified through the hysteresis observed in the transverse
and (/or) longitudinal magnetoresistance under an applied perpendicular magnetic field.
The hysteresis in resistance (Rxy/Rxx) is a direct consequence of the hysteresis of the mag-
netization of the (Ferro) magnetic ordering under a magnetic field, similar to what is found
in traditional ferromagnets. Recently, such hysteresis curves have been reported in other
graphene-based systems like suspended rhombohedral trilayer graphene (s-RTG)22 and a
superconducting magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATLG)23 under the application
of parallel magnetic field (B||), suggesting existence of magnetic ordering of spin nature in
these van der Waals platforms.
The hysteresis in Rxy (and/or Rxx) magnetoresistance is characterized by: i) sharp/step
jumps in measured resistance at the coercive field (|Bco|), which depends on the direction
of the magnetic field sweep and properties of the sample, and ii) a mismatch in the residual
resistance at zero magnetic fields under a complete magnetization loop.
