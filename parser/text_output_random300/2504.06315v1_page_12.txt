dynamics. Here, we extend the analysis to include ocular circulation, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of
how changes in LVc influence both systemic and retinal hemodynamics.
The simulation results in Table 6 show a decrease in SP/DP and CO, as well as an increase in both EDV and ESV
as LVc is reduced. These changes can be attributed to the decreased ability of the left ventricle to expand and contract
effectively when its compliance is reduced. Lower LV compliance leads to less efficient filling and ejection, lowering
pressures and cardiac output. At the same time, the reduced compliance causes the ventricle to hold more blood at
both the end of diastole and systole, which is reflected in the increase in EDV and ESV. These results highlight how
impaired ventricular compliance can significantly affect both the pumping efficiency and volume dynamics of the
heart (see Fig. 5).
On the ocular side, changes in LV compliance also impact the retinal blood flow. As LVc decreases, there is a
reduction in CRA and CRV blood flows. These changes are more pronounced in CRA blood flow, which decreases in
response to lower cardiac output. CRV flow is also affected, especially when LVc is reduced by 50%. These results
suggest that cardiovascular alterations may influence the ocular circulation, reflecting the dependencies between the
heart and ocular dynamics.

Simulation C: combined effects of LVc reduction and IOP increase
Finally, Simulation C explores the combined effects of reducing LVc while simultaneously varying IOP. Variations
in IOP, similarly to Scenario A, affect the ocular system primarily at a local level, without significant impact on the
overall cardiovascular dynamics. As reported in Tables 7, 8, and 9, the overall cardiovascular functions - SP/DP,
EDV/ESV and CO, respectively - remain largely unchanged at varying IOP. This confirms the hypothesis that IOP-
related effects are confined to the local ocular circulation, while global system parameters remain stable.
However, the combination of reduced LVc and increased IOP has a marked effect on ocular hemodynamics.
