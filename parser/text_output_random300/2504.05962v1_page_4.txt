 
listed in parentheses below the corresponding observed 
datetime. In the training and validation sets, the pixel 
sampling in the slit direction and integration time 
parameters were set to 0.1585 and 4.8, respectively, 
while these parameters were generally set to 0.317 and 
1.6, respectively. For the test set, the observation mode, 
integration time, and scan step size parameters were set 
to ‘FL’, 0.8, and 2, respectively, unlike the ‘QT’, 1.6, 
and 1 setup used in all other cases. Despite these 
variations in observation modes, which result in 
differing noise levels across the data, the deep learning 
model is expected to perform robustly under these 
diverse conditions. 
2.3. Training and evaluation 
All the data preprocessing and the model training 
setups follow [6]. The SP maps used for training were 
resized to achieve a more focused field of view (FOV) 
on ARs. The total pixel counts for the eight resized SP 
maps used for training and the five SP maps used for 
validation were 911,860 and 875,940, respectively. We 
normalized the dataset for model training using min-
max scaling for Stokes I and zero-mean scaling for 
Stokes V. The training process utilized a batch size of 
512 over 1000 epochs, with the Adam optimizer and a 
reduced learning rate on the plateau parameter set with 
a patience of 50 epochs. Early stopping was also 
implemented with a patience of 100 epochs. The 
reconstruction loss function during training is defined as 
the sum of the mean absolute errors (MAEs) for the 
Stokes I and V profiles, as shown in Equation 1: 
𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠= 𝑀𝐴𝐸𝐼+ 𝑀𝐴𝐸𝑉.  
   (1) 
To evaluate the model’s performance, similar to [6], 
we separately calculated the root mean square error 
(RMSE) between the original input profiles and the 
reconstructed output profiles of Stokes I and V spectra. 
The RMSE value calculated for each pixel in the SP 
maps serves as a measure of reconstruction accuracy, 
with pixels exhibiting higher RMSE values being more 
likely to be anomalous. 
3. RESULTS 
3.1. Model performance 
Using the pre-trained compression model, we 
reconstructed the test spectra from three pre-flare SP 
maps and one during-flare SP map and computed the 
reconstruction error as RMSE for each pixel across all 
four SP maps. Table 2 presents the observational error 
(𝜎𝑜𝑏𝑠), calculated as the mean standard deviation of the 
continuum within the wavelength pixel range from 0 to 
15, along with the resulting mean reconstruction error 
(𝜇𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸) values for both Stokes spectra across all four 
test SP maps.  
Table 2. Comparison of observational error and mean 
reconstruction error values. 
In all four cases, the mean RMSEs were lower than the 
observational errors for both Stokes parameters, 
indicating the model’s satisfactory performance. As an 
example, Figure 2 presents the Stokes V spectra at four 
different spatial positions within AR 13663 (top-left 
plot), along with their reconstruction error (RMSEV) 
values (top-right plot) and reconstructed profiles 
(bottom 
plot) 
in 
the

coded in the continuum image as follows: quiet Sun 
(red), pore (yellow), penumbra (magenta), and umbra 
(green), with these colors also representing their 
respective information in the other plots of Figure 2. The 
reconstructed profiles closely match the true Stokes V 
profiles, demonstrating a significant reduction in noise 
levels where applicable.
