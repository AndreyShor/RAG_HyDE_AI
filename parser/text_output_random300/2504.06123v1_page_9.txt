Proof of Theorem 2
In order to prove Theorem 2 of the main paper, we first develop the following Lemma 2.
Lemma 2: The error η(γ)
n
= ∥|χ(γ)
n ⟩−|ϕn⟩]∥averaged over a uniform distribution of γ after n steps of SRGD
with steps size ∆β = β
n is upper bounded by
˜bn =

and for any ˜δ > 0 we have that

Proof : We define |∆(γ)
k ⟩= |χ(γ)
k ⟩−|ϕk⟩so that the random variable η(γ)
k
= ∥|∆(γ)
k ⟩∥is given as the Euclidean
norm of the (unnormalized ) ket vector |∆(γ)
k ⟩. The error η(γ)
k
describes the norm difference between the state |χ(γ)
k ⟩
prepared by k steps of stochastic Riemannian gradient descent (SRGD) defined by the update rule
|χ(γ)
k (s)⟩= esg(γ)

k−1⟩,
(42)
where g(γ)
k
= DTr

[H, |χ(γ)
k−1⟩⟨χ(γ)

iPk is the stochastic Riemannian gradient, and the state |ϕk⟩obtained by
k steps of Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) defined by
|ϕk(s)⟩= esGk |ϕk−1⟩,
(43)
where Gk = [H, |ϕk−1⟩⟨ϕk−1|] is the Riemannian gradient. The update occurs for a step size s = ∆β and D is the
number of orthonormal Pauli basis elements Pk, satisfying Tr(PkPk′) = δk,k′ and P 2
k = 1
d, that we sample from.
In general D = d2 −1 = 22N −1, but we may pick D to be smaller as long as Gk can be decomposed with fewer
basis elements. The following proof holds in either case.
In order to prove Lemma 2, we make use of Jensen’s inequality to find
Eγ[η(γ)
n ] = Eγ∥|∆(γ)
n ⟩∥≤
q
Eγ∥|∆(γ)
n ⟩∥2
(44)
Var(η(γ)
n ) = Eγ[η(γ)2
n
] −(Eγ[η(γ)
n ])2 ≤Eγ∥|∆(γ)
n ⟩∥2,
(45)
and thus both the variance and average can be bounded by bounding Eγ∥|∆(γ)
n ⟩∥2.
The proof proceeds similarly to how Theorem 1 was addressed, in particular we derive something analogous to (37),
but construct the recursion relation in the square η(γ)2
k
of the Euclidean norm of |∆(γ)
k ⟩, instead of a recursion relation
in the norm. For η(γ)2
k
averaged over the paths γ we can perform a Taylor series expansion, up to first order in s, to
obtain
Eγ[η(γ)2

] = Eγ⟨∆(γ)

where “c.c.” denotes the complex conjugate and in the second line we used that the average EPk in the k-the step
over the Pauli Pk is given by
EPk[g(γ)
