KEY SUBROUTINE ANALYSIS
With primitives all set, we now establish theorems for the key quantum subroutine used for multivariate mean value
estimation. Intuitively, the idea is to build from the oracle in Definition II.36, combined with the phase estimation
procedure used in Ref. [5]. Eventually, we build several programs that give us insights into the expectation value of
the random variable with high probability.
A.
Spectrum Analysis of The Grover Gate
As we will see later, a successful univariate estimator is built upon an estimator for the univariate case. First,
following the insight made by Ref. [2], we construct the Grover gate with access to the phase oracle of a univariate
random variable:
Definition III.1 (Univariate Grover Gate). Given the phase oracle O for the univariate random variable θ, the
Grover gate for θ is
G = RO
(34)
where R is the reflection gate with
R = P(2 |0⟩⟨0| −I)P† = 2 |1⟩⟨1| −I
(35)
In Sec. 3.7 of Ref. [2] the authors provide a geometric understanding of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Here, we
would like to provide a more explicit form.
Fix a univariate random variable θ. Consider an eigenvector of the Grover gate with eigenvalue eiα. Say it is an
associated quantum state of the complex random variable ψ. Applying Grover gate gives
G |ψ⟩= (2 |1⟩⟨1| −I) U |ψ⟩= 2 |1⟩

The eigenvalue equation is thus

In terms of the random variables:

Despite the look, this equation is solvable. We find that ignoring edge cases, α needs to satisfy

and then the eigenvector, in random variable form, is given by

The details of calculation is found in the following theorem.
Theorem III.2 (Spectrum of Grover Gate). The spectrum of the Grover gate G for a real univariate variable θ
contains all eigenvalues of the form eiα where −π < α ⩽π satisfies Eq. (39) (assuming tan θk−α

do not blow up
for any k ∈Ω). Corresponding to α, the eigenvector, specified by |ψ⟩where ψ is a complex random variable, satisfy
Eq. (40).
In the event that there are multiple outcomes in θ that share the same value (mod 2π). For each possible such value
φ ∈(−π, π], let S = {k ∈Ω: θk = φ (mod 2π)}. We find, in addition, an eigenvalue eiα satisfying φ −α = π
(mod 2π), and eigenvectors |ψ⟩(where ψ is a complex random variable) with
ψk = 0
∀k ̸∈S
E [ψ] = 0
