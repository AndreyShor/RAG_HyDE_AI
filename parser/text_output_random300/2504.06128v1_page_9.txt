1.4. Moment bounds. A key tool in our analysis are moment bounds on the partition
function Zβ
Lpφq, see (1.17) (we denote the system size by L in place of N for later convenience).
Such bounds, based on a functional operator approach, have been exploited in several contexts,
see [GQT21, CSZ23a, LZ23, CCR23, CZ23, CZ24, CN25]. We provide here a universal bound
of independent interest, which applies to all regimes of β mentioned so far (sub-critical,
quasi-critical and critical) and to general initial conditions φp¨q supported on sub-diffusive
or diffusive scales Op
?
Lq.
We focus on initial conditions which are probability mass functions on Z2,† i.e.
φp¨q ě 0 ,

φpxq “ 1 ,
with finite mean-squared displacement from its center of mass:

We require two natural bounds on φ.

(the factor 2 in the exponent is for later convenience). This allows φp¨q to be localised
on a diffusive or sub-diffusive scale, as it implies

(1.31)
which means that the peaks of φ are comparable to those of a uniform distribution
(note that φ puts most of its mass in a ball of radius
a
Drφs, by Chebyshev).
We do not restrict β to any particular regime, but we consider partition functions with
uniformly bounded variance: for some c3 ă 8

Lpφqs ď c3 .
(1.32)
We will show that, together with (1.29), this implies that β lies within or below the critical
regime as L Ñ 8, see Lemma 5.4.
We are ready to state our general moment bound.
Theorem 1.11 (General moment bound). Given h P N and ˆt, c1, c2, c3 P p0, 8q, there
are constants Lh, Ch ă 8 (depending also on ˆt, c1, c2, c3) such that

†Since φ ÞÑ Zβ
Lpφq is linear, any φ ě 0 with ř
xPZ2 φpxq ă 8 can be normalised to a probability mass
function.
