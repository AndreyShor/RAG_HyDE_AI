To sum up, in our work, E0 is the amplitude of the electric field components of light, E is the electric field complex
amplitude, and ˜E is the effective electric field.
Appendix B: Phenomenological representation of magnon photo-transport
As we discussed in Subsec. II D 3, the magnon spin photoconductivity and magnon energy photoconductivity can
be expressed as χ(E)

Appendix C: Calculation details of the density matrix

Quantum Liouville equation
The density matrix of single-magnon is ˆρ(t), we can calculate the correction of the density matrix by quantum
Liouville equation (Eq. 11)61–64

Then we take Γ = 1
τ , in which τ is the relaxation time of magnons42,46. And we assume that light (time-dependent
electric field) is applied when t = 0, and we ignore the effect of scattering on the transport when t < 064. ˆρ(0) is
the equilibrium density matrix. For ease of derivation, we take damping density matrix ˆ˜ρ(t) = eΓtˆρ(t)62,64. In the
interaction picture, the operator can be expressed as ˆOI(t) = ei ˆ
H0t/ℏˆOe−i ˆ
H0t/ℏ. We consider the quantum Liouville
equation in the picture of interaction64
