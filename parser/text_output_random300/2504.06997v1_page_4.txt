The normalized electric field temporal ACF, 𝑔𝑔1(𝜏𝜏), is related to the normalized light intensity 
ACF, 𝑔𝑔2(𝜏𝜏), through the Siegert equation37: 
𝑔𝑔2(𝜏𝜏) = 1 + 𝛽𝛽|𝑔𝑔1(𝜏𝜏)|2,
(5) 
where 𝛽𝛽 depends on the laser stability, coherence length, and the number of speckles detected34. 
The experimentally measured light intensity ACF can be calculated as: 
𝑔𝑔2(𝜏𝜏) = 〈𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡)𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡+ 𝜏𝜏)〉
〈𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡)〉2
,

where 〈… 〉 denotes the average over the integration time 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, and 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡) is the measured light 
intensity fluctuation. By fitting the measured light intensity ACF to the analytical solution, the BFi 
(𝛼𝛼𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏) can be extracted. 
2.2 Training dataset preparation 
The clean training dataset was generated using the two-layer DCS analytical model. Based on 
previous studies10,38, we varied only the dominant parameters of the model. Specifically, we varied 
the brain 𝜇𝜇𝑎𝑎 and 𝜇𝜇𝑠𝑠
′, the extracerebral layer thickness, and the extracerebral layer 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏 (𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒) and 
brain 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏 (𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏), while keeping other parameters constant. The brain 𝜇𝜇𝑎𝑎 varied linearly from 
0.005 to 0.025 mm-1 with a step size of 0.005 mm-1, and the brain 𝜇𝜇𝑠𝑠
′ varied from 0.9 to 1.3 mm-1 
(the step size: 0.1 mm-1). The extracerebral layer thickness varied from 8 to 15 mm (the step size: 
1 mm). 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 varied linearly from 5×10-7 to 5×10-5 mm2/s with a step of 5×10-7 mm2/s (100 
steps). Each 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 corresponded to 20 steps of 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏_𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 , with the extracerebral-to-brain 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏 
fraction ranging from 0.05 to 0.3. This relationship was estimated from previous reports39,40. In 
total, we simulated 400,000 clean 𝑔𝑔2 data (5×5×8×100×20). The 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏, physiological and optical 
properties for the two-layer analytical model were adopted from previous studies10,14,38,39,41–43, to 
ensure a thorough coverage of relevant ranges. 𝜌𝜌 was fixed at 35 mm, 𝛽𝛽 was assumed to be 0.5, 
and the lag time 𝜏𝜏 ranged from 1.28 to 39.68 µs (step size: 1.28 µs) to align with the hardware 
settings (see Sec. 2.3). We fixed 𝛽𝛽 as a constant because scaling the 𝑔𝑔2 curve to the same range 
will eliminate the influence of 𝛽𝛽 variance at a given flow rate. As a result, it is unnecessary to vary 
𝛽𝛽 to account for potential hardware instability (see Sec. 2.3 for details). The parameter 
configurations are summarized in Table 1.
