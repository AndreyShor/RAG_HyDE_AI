Model and Theoretical Framework 
2.1 Lead-Conductor Nanojunction 
We begin with the schematic nanojunction shown in Fig. 1, where a one-
dimensional (1D) non-magnetic conductor is connected to two 1D leads, referred to as 
the source and drain. Electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions 
are considered within the conductor, while the side-attached leads are assumed to be 
free from these interactions. To model the source-conductor-drain nanojunction, we 
adopt a tight-binding (TB) framework. Since the electrodes are free from e-e and e-ph 
interactions, their TB Hamiltonians are straightforward and are not explicitly present-
ed here. Instead, we focus on the conductor that bridges the two electrodes. 
 
2.2 TB Hamiltonian of the conductor 
For a conductor associated with e-e and e-ph interactions, the TB Hamiltonian can 
be written following the Hubbard-Holstein model as, 
 
         ℋch = ∑𝜀𝑖𝜎𝐶𝑖𝜎
+𝐶𝑖𝜎

                                   (1) 
where  𝐶𝑖𝜎
+ and  𝐶𝑖𝜎 are the conventional Fermionic creation and annihilation opera-
tors at site i, 𝑡 is the nearest-neighbor hopping strength, 𝑢 is the Hubbard interaction 
strength, g denotes the e-ph coupling parameter, and  𝑏𝑖
+, 𝑏𝑖 are Bosonic operators 
associated with phonons.  
The on-site potential of each site of the conductor is taken following the AAH 
model. For both up and down spin electrons, the site energies at any site i are given 
by,  
                                                     𝜀𝑖↑= 𝜀𝑖↓= 𝑊𝑐𝑜𝑠(2𝛱𝑏ⅈ+ 𝜙𝜈),              
(2) 
where 𝑊 denotes the AAH modulation strength, commonly referred to as the corre-
lated disorder strength. The parameter b is an irrational number, which makes the site 
energies correlated, and  𝜙𝜈  is the AAH phase factor. To have a disorder-free system, 
we set W=0. 
Through the Lang-Firsov unitary transformation [6, 9] followed by a zero-phonon 
averaging, the e-ph coupled Hamiltonian can be mapped onto an effective electronic 
Hamiltonian:
