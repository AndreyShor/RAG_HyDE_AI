Response rate of a static detector in the HHI state
The pullback of the two-point function shown in Eq. (22) along the trajectory of a static detector is given by,

Here, we have used U = −2Rse−u/2Rs and V = 2Rsev/2Rs, where u = tS −r∗and v = tS + r∗with r = r′ in the second
line. For a static detector, dτ =

1 −Rs/r dtS = κ dtS (say). Therefore, the above expression becomes

Using the periodicity in the imaginary time of the above expression one can see the KMS thermality of the HHI state.
Substituting for W HHI
