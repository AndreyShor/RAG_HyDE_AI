ABSTRACT
To connect supergravity with the real world, a highly non-trivial require-
ment is complete spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in an approximately
flat four-dimensional space-time. In no-scale supergravity models, this nat-
urally happens at the classical level: the gravitino mass, setting the scale of
supersymmetry breaking, slides along a flat direction of the potential with
vanishing energy. This contribution briefly describes, with a personal selec-
tion of simple illustrative examples, some qualitative features of no-scale
models that relate them to a possible dynamical generation of the hierar-
chies between the vacuum energy scale, the weak scale and the Planck scale.
It includes comments on their versions with extended supersymmetry, on
their higher-dimensional origin and on how their still unsolved problems of
quantum stability can already be addressed, with some results, at the level
of supergravity compactifications, although their solution (if any) will even-
tually require a better understanding of superstring theories.
