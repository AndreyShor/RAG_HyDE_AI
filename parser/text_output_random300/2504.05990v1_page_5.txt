Figure 1a (left): Conventional health disparities studies including discovery between SDOH and medical tests to 
yield health disparity as observed in terms differences of health rates. Note also that medical images often present 
indicators of differences of health rates, with interpretations (radiology reports) sometimes included in the EHR. 
However, such radiologic interpretations are (i) manual, (ii) are not performed at scale, (iii) are retained only for 
the disease/conditions in question, and are not within the EHR at the pixel level. 
Figure 1b (right): On the other hand, ‘big data’-extracted image-based phenotypes from AI analysis can yield, at 
scale, objective characteristics of both abnormal and normal presentations in medical images, which can be 
substituted for existing EHR plus additional data in health disparities discovery studies. Thus, we propose in this 
paper to create a medical imaging-based platform (probe & dashboard) to support health disparities researchers. 
 
Medical images could provide unique data for identifying and monitoring a number of HDs, 
but this potential is currently untapped. We propose that routine clinical medical images —
especially, those deemed negative for a given diagnostic task — can be repurposed as an innovative 
valuable data source for HD researchers. These images can support ongoing efforts to understand 
and mitigate HDs, by enabling large scale AI analysis of clinical medical images as an HD probe 
(Figure 2).
