The Path to aN3LO Parton Distributions
• The effect of MHOUs at N3LO is very small for quarks but not negligible for the gluon PDF.
• Evidence for intrinsic charm is somewhat increased already at NNLO by the inclusion of
MHOUs, and somewhat increased again when going from NNLO to N3LO.
• The impact of N3LO corrections on the total cross-section for Higgs in gluon fusion is very
small on the scale of the PDF uncertainty.
All in all, these results underline the importance of the inclusion of N3LO corrections and
MHOUs for precision phenomenology at sub-percent accuracy.
Future NNPDF releases will include by default MHOUs, will be at all orders up to aN3LO, and
will include a photon PDF. Specifically, we aim to extend to aN3LO with MHOUs our recent
construction of NNPDF4.0QED PDFs [11, 325]. Indeed, aN3LO PDFs including a photon PDF
(such as those recently released by MSHT20 [326]) will be a necessary ingredient for theory
predictions based on state-of-the art QCD and electroweak (EW) corrections.
Another important line of future development involves the all-order resummation of potentially
large perturbative contributions in the large x and small x regions [327, 328]. This will involve
matching resummed and fixed-order cross-sections and (at small x) perturbative evolution
in the new streamlined NNPDF theory pipeline. Such resummed PDFs will be instrumental
for precision phenomenology: specifically at small x, forward neutrino production at the LHC
and scattering processes for high-energy astroparticle physics, and at large x, searches for new
physics in high-mass final states at the LHC and future hadron colliders.
