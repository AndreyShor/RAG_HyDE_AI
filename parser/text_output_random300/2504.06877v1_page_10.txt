where Jn(x) is the n-th Bessel function. The first sum in Eq. (20) describes the current due
to the drive in the absence of probe signal. The response to the probe tone at frequency ωp
contains frequencies ωp + nΩfor every integer n due to the nonlinear frequency mixing in the
junction. Thus, each frequency shift nΩhas a corresponding admittance:

The plots of the frequency-preserving component of the admittance YJ,0(ω;ϕ0, V0,Ω) are shown
in Fig. 4. First, we observe that the residue of the inductive pole at zero frequency has changed,
which is a manifestation of the ac-Stark effect. We also clearly see that frequency mixing gives
rise to multiple singularities located at frequencies ω = ±∆Σ/ħh + nΩ. Each of these singulari-
ties corresponds to enabling or disabling of a Cooper pair breaking process involving n photons
from the drive and a single photon from the probe: Cooper pair breaking with absorption of n
photons from the drive and absorption or emission of a single probe photon at frequency ω is
allowed if nΩ> ∆Σ/ħh ∓ω, respectively. We also notice that the character of the singularities
depends on the dc phase bias: for the unbiased and π-biased junction the Cooper pair breaking
is more efficient for processes involving odd and even number of drive photons, respectively.
The highly non-trivial dependence of the admittance on the probe frequency may result
in complex dynamics of the electromagnetic field in the superconducting circuits and mem-
ory effects. The latter should be especially well pronounced if a normal mode of the circuit
has a frequency close to the singularity of the admittance. Another important effect is that
the balance between the photon-absorption and photon-emission processes involving differ-
ent numbers of drive photons determines the population of the normal modes in the steady
state. Such a phenomenon can be used in applications for cooling and heating the photonic
system. In the following Section, we confirm this qualitative reasoning with direct calculations
for a simple example of an LC-circuit shunted with a driven Josephson junction.

Low-impedance resonator
We consider a circuit shown in Fig. 5 shunted with a Josephson junction to the ground through
an ideal voltage source. The junction is biased by an external flux and the resonator is probed
through a capacitively coupled transmission line. We assume the coupling capacitance Cp to
be infinitesimally small, so the dissipation induced by the probe is negligible relative to the one
induced by the junction. We consider the limit of a low-impedance circuit, where the charac-
teristic impedance Zr =
p
Lr/Cr meets the condition Zr ≪RQ and the Josephson inductance
is much higher than the intrinsic inductance of the resonator Φ2
0/EJ ≫Lr. These assumptions
