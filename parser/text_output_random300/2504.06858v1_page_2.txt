In this paper our aim is to obtain an estimate for complex eigenvalues of the
operator
(1.1)
WV(b) = W0(b) −V,
where the potential V is a complex-valued function.
In order to describe our result, we first assume that V ∈L1(R) is real-valued. The
scalar inequality 2 cosh(2πbk) −2 ≥(2πbk)2 implies the operator inequality
W0(b) −2 ≥−b2 d2
dx2
(1.2)
on dom(W0(b)). By Sobolev’s inequality, we can conclude that the operator
(1.1) is bounded from below on the common domain of W0(b) and V. We can
thus consider its Friedrichs extension, which we continue to denote by WV(b).
By applying Weyl’s theorem (in a version for quadratic forms) and Rellich’s
lemma together with the fact that the form domain of W0(b) is continuously em-
bedded in H1(R) we conclude that the spectrum of WV(b) consists of essential
spectrum [2, ∞) and discrete finite-multiplicity eigenvalues below. Details of
this argument in the similar case of a Schr¨odinger operator can be found in the
book [14].
Any eigenvalue λ of the operator (1.1) with real-valued V can be written as λ =
−2 cos(ω), with ω ∈[0, π) for λ ∈[−2, 2] and ω ∈i [0, ∞) for λ ≤−2. Under
the condition that all eigenvalues λj = −2 cos(ωj) are larger than or equal to −2,
the authors of [22] proved a Lieb–Thirring inequality

As discussed in [22, Remark 1.2], the proof in general does not apply if there are
multiple eigenvalues below −2. However, in the special case that single one of
the eigenvalues is below −2 the proof remains applicable. Furthermore, it can
also be used to establish that any real eigenvalue λ = −2 cos(ω), regardless of
whether it lies above or below −2, must satisfy

In recent years there has been an increasing interest in eigenvalue estimates for
complex-valued potentials. The authors in [1] developed an elegant observa-
tion that allows to locate complex eigenvalues for Schr¨odinger operators with
complex-valued potentials. Such an approach and its generalisations were used
