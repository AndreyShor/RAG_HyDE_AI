The determinant of a general (n+1)×(n+1) matrix can similarly be deﬁned in terms of
the Segre embedding of Pn ×Pn into P(n+1)2−1. For example, let X = P1 ×P1 with respective
homogeneous coordinates [x1 : x2] and [y1 : y2] and consider the Segre embedding
σ : [x1 : x2] × [y1 : y2] 7→[x1y1 : x1y2 : x2y1 : x2y2] ∈P3 .
(5.7)
Denoting the homogeneous coordinates on the dual P3 by [a1 : a2 : a3 : a4] the intersection of
the corresponding hyperplane with X is given by
I = {⃗y T A⃗x = 0 } ⊂X ,
A =
 
a1 a3
a2 a4
!
,
(5.8)
and the projective dual variety again takes the form X∨= { det A = 0 } ⊂P3.
If A has full rank then I is just a rational curve since the projection to any of the P1
factors of X is a bijection. On the other hand, if the rank of A drops to one, then I consists
of two rational curves that intersect transversely in a point. To see this, note that when ⃗x is
the up to scale unique (right) zero-eigenvector of A then the condition on ⃗y is trivial while
for generic ⃗x we again have a bijective projection to the ﬁrst P1 factor of X.
Hypermatrices and hyperdeterminants
In the case of an (n + 1) × (m + 1) matrix,
with n ̸= m, the analogous construction using the Segre embedding of Pn × Pm leads to a
projective dual variety that is not a hypersurface and therefore the determinant of a non-
square matrix can be deﬁned to be 1. However, when applied to the Segre embedding of more
general products Pk1 × . . . × Pkr, the deﬁning equation of the projective dual variety leads to
the concept of hyperdeterminants of (k1 + 1) × . . . × (kr + 1) hypermatrices.
One refers to the dimensions (k1 + 1) × . . . × (kr + 1) as the format of the corresponding
hypermatrix. In the following we will denote by Det A the hyperdeterminant of a hypermatrix
A and reserve det A for the case when A is of format m × m.
Hyperdeterminants of format 2 × 2 × 2 have ﬁrst appeared in the work of Cayley [64]
and for general format they have been systematically introduced over a century later in [65]
(for a nice review see also [66]). While the determinant of an n × m matrix is non-trivial
only if n = m, [65, Theorem 1.3] states that more generally the hyperdeterminant of format
(k1 × 1) × . . . × (kr + 1) is non-trivial if and only if
kj ≤
X
i̸=j
ki ,
(5.9)
for all j = 1, . . . , r. The degree of the hyperdeterminant of format 2×n×n as a homogeneous
polynomial in the entries of the hypermatrix is given by 2n(n −1).
A hypermatrix A of format (k1 + 1) × . . . × (kr + 1) can be interpreted as a multilinear
map fA : Ck1+1 × . . . × Ckr+1 →C. It is called degenerate if there exist non-zero vectors
⃗x(i) ∈Cki+1, i = 1, . . . , r such that

⃗x(1), . . . , ⃗x(i−1), ⃗y, ⃗x(i+1), . . . , ⃗x(r)
