This action is gauge invariant under the following gauge transformations,
a1 Ð→a1 + dλ0,
b1 Ð→b1 + dµ0,
˜a1 Ð→˜a1 + d˜λ0 −µ1,
˜b1 Ð→˜b1 + d˜µ0,
b0 Ð→b0 −˜µ0,
c2 Ð→c2 + dµ1.
(6.39)
The local equation of motions are,
b1 ∶da1 = 0,
˜a1 ∶d˜b1 = 0,
b0 ∶dc2 = 0
c2 ∶db0 + ˜b1 = 0,
˜b1 ∶d˜a1 −1
2da1 + c2 = 0,
a1 ∶db1 + da1 −1
2d˜b1 = 0.

Once again, we realize the line operators that end on point operators in the bulk.
If we now want to gauge the full Z4, we can do it by imposing boundary
conditions (6.36), along with Dirichlet conditions for c2 and Neumann conditions
for b0. However, unlike the non-anomalous case, we do not get decomposition in
this situation. The reason is that the b0 point operators sit at the ends of ˜X lines
which no longer vanish at the boundary. Instead, ˜X is essentially ˜X′Y . At the
boundary ˜X′ vanishes, but Y does not, so the b0 point operators are not genuine.

General picture in quasi-Hopf algebras
Next, we turn to the algebraic approach. We describe the original global symmetry
G with ’t Hooft anomaly α ∈H3(G,U(1)) in terms of a quasi-Hopf algebra H such
that
Rep(H) ≅Vec(G,α).
(6.41)
In this fashion, the quasi-Hopf algebra implicitly encodes the anomaly. Then, the
idea of the resolution is to ﬁnd fusion categories C, K for which there is an exact
sequence
K Ð→C Ð→Vec(G,α)
