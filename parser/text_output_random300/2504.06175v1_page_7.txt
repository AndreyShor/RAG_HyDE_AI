FIG. 5. Results from simulation of ZX3B distillation with circuit noise given in Fig. 3b. Plots (5a) and (5b) show fractional
change in Bell fidelity, r plotted against initial Bell fidelity Fb for various gate and measurement errors. The region of the plot
above r = 1 indicates where the noisy distillation circuit is beneficial. Plots (5c) and (5d) focus on low noise Bell pairs and
show the percentage decrease in Bell infidelity plotted against initial fidelity Fb for various gate and measurement errors.

Global Depolarizing noise
In this section, we apply circuit noise to Bell pairs and
degrade them under a global depolarizing noise channel
Nλ (see Fig. 11 in App. G); this global noise is consistent
with Clifford twirling [46, 47], which we will do experi-
mentally in Sec. IV A.
1.
Two Bell Distillation
We numerically study the performance of the recur-
rence distillation protocol (Z2B) after the Bell pairs are
degraded by a global depolarizing channel. The distil-
lation circuit under study modifies the one in Fig. 3a
by replacing local with global depolarizing noise during
waiting (circuit available as Fig. 11a in App. G) In the
first plot, see Fig. 6a, the Bell pairs are created with equal
Bell fidelity, F1 = F2. As the global depolarizing noise
parameter λ is increased, the fidelity of Bell pairs prior
to distillation decreases.
For any fixed gate and mea-
surement error, as λ is increased the ratio r, plotted on
the y-axis, first increases reaches a maximum and then
decreases to one. This ratio can be as high as 1.2, and
it remains above one for a wider range of gate and mea-
surement error values. This represents broad improve-
ment from distillation. The improvements shrink as the
gate and measurement error are increased. In Fig. 6b the
Bell pairs have unequal Bell fidelity prior to distillation.
This asymmetry is created by noise channel Λp on qubit
labelled 0 in Fig. 11a. A key qualitative effect of this
asymmetry is in the ratio r. This ratio remains below
one for higher initial Bell fidelities, thus shrinking the
range of gate and measurement error values over which
distillation presents an improvement. The improvement
is also smaller in comparison to those reported in Fig. 6a.

Three Bell Distillation
Here we continue from the previous section, but indi-
cate results from the double selection (ZX3B) protocol.
