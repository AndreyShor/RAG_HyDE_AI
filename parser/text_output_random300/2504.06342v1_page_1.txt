ABSTRACT
We present MACER3D (Multiscale AGN-regulated Cosmic Ecosystem Resolver in 3D), a
new suite of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that study active galactic nuclei
(AGN) feedback on galactic scales over Gyr duration, with major enhancement in subgrid
models and gas physics over its predecessor – MACER (Massive AGN Controlled Ellipticals
Resolved) which is in two dimensions (hereafter MACER2D). MACER3D resolves gas dy-
namics from within the Bondi radius (∼25 pc) to halo scales. Combined with black hole
accretion theory, it enables an accurate calculation of AGN outputs and subsequently their
large-scale feedback effects. We present results from simulating an isolated elliptical galaxy
with different feedback configurations. In the fiducial model with both AGN and supernova
(SN) feedback, the temporal evolution of AGN luminosity and star formation rate are strongly
correlated, suggesting shared dependence on the availability of gas supply for SMBH accre-
tion and star formation. AGN duty cycles of several percent with a single-cycle timescale
of ∼102 Myr agree with observations, while models with only AGN or SN feedback fail
to reproduce observed cycles. While all models maintain a quiescent galaxy state, fiducial
AGN+SN feedback model results in higher star formation than no-SN feedback, suggesting
SN feedback, when acting synergistically with AGN feedback, may positively impact star for-
mation. Combined AGN and SN feedback enhances halo-scale metal enrichment compared
to single-feedback models. The simulated X-ray properties match observations and predict
transient cavities produced by cold-mode AGN winds from past burst events. The differences
between the results obtained by MACER2D and MACER3D are also discussed.
