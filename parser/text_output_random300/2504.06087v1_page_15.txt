Because we use this system as a simple benchmark system, we have not re-optimized the geometry for each
geometry and spin state. Thus, these energy differences may change when considering fully relaxed geometries.
Convergence of CCSD(T) calculations is nontrivial for this system due to strong spin contamination in unre-
stricted Hartree Fock calculations. We find that only when using unrestricted Kohn Sham orbitals as a reference
state –where spin contamination is much less severe – does CCSD(T) converge to the correct solution.

Model ablations
We investigate the importance of crucial hyperparameters of our neural wave function beyond the cutoff radius
c. For this, we investigate the singlet-triplet gap in naphthalene as in Fig. 3c. We compare four models, our
standard FiRE with hyperparameters as defined in App. L, one with only a single determinant Ndet = 1, one
with 16 determinants Ndet = 16, and one without the attention Jastrow factor from Sec. 4.2. The absolute
energy for both states and the relative energy independence on the optimization steps are shown in Fig. S3.
While enlarging the number of determinants to 16 improves absolute energies, convergence is slower, and the
relative energy takes longer to converge. Notably, FiRE accurately reconstructs the relative energy between
the two states within 50k optimization steps, even with a single determinant. Crucially, the attention Jastrow
factor is important in accurately reconstructing the relative energy.

Measuring speedups
To test the effect of these speed-ups in practice, we compare the runtime of our ansatz against FermiNet [2],
Psiformer [6] and LapNet [7]. For all three architectures we use the implementations in the LapNet codebase
and use the forward Laplacian to accelerate kinetic energy computations [7]. We use cumulenes, fully double-
bonded hydrocarbon chains of the form CH2 Cn CH2 as test systems.
We determine the runtime of all
components required for a single optimization step: MCMC sampling, calculation of the kinetic energy, and
