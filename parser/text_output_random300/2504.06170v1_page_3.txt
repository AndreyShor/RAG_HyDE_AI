details). The CHIMPS 13CO(J = 3–2) line data (hav-
ing critical density ≥104 cm−3 at temperature ≤20 K;
Rigby et al. 2016) were also examined toward the se-
lected target area. The σ(TA), the velocity separation
between the channels, and the angular resolution of the
CHIMPS 13CO(J = 3–2) line data are about 0.6 K, 0.5
km s−1, and 15′′, respectively. To enhance the visibil-
ity of faint or diffuse features, the CHIMPS line data
were smoothed using a Gaussian function, resulting in
an angular resolution of ∼27′′ and σ(TA) ∼0.15 K. In
addition, we also examined the RAMPS NH3(1–1) line
data (having critical density ∼3 × 103 cm−3; Hogge
et al. 2018) in this study. The rms noise level, the ve-
locity separation between the channels, and the angu-
lar resolution of the RAMPS NH3(1–1) data are about
0.16 K, 0.2 km s−1, and 32′′, respectively. We smoothed
the RAMPS line data using a Gaussian function with
Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of about 6′′. In
the direction of the selected target area, the ATLAS-
GAL clumps at 870 µm (from Urquhart et al. 2018) and
the positions of YSOs from the Spitzer/IRAC Candi-
date YSO (SPICY) Catalog (Kuhn et al. 2021) were col-
lected. The Herschel dust temperature (Td) and H2 col-
umn density (N(H2)) maps (resolution ∼12′′) were ob-
tained from Marsh et al. (2017). These maps were gen-
erated using the Bayesian PPMAP procedure (Marsh
et al. 2015), applied to the Herschel 70–500 µm images
from the Hi-GAL survey (Molinari et al. 2010a). The
photometric magnitudes of point-like sources at 3.6, 4.5,
and 5.8 µm were obtained from the Spitzer GLIMPSE-I
Spring ′07 catalog (Benjamin et al. 2003). The data sets
utilized in this work can be downloaded from the links
provided in Section 6.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Existence of an extended filamentary structure
Figure 1a presents the Spitzer 8.0 µm image overlaid
with MAGPIS 20 cm continuum emission contours. As
mentioned earlier, the Spitzer 8.0 µm image reveals an
extended IRDC, as indicated by arrows. The MAGPIS
radio continuum contours offer information on the distri-
bution of ionized emission toward the IRDC. Previously
reported structures, such as N59 and N59-North, are
also labeled in the figure. Figure 1b offers a closer view
of this IRDC, including N59-North. Asterisks mark sev-
eral IRDC candidates identified by Pari & Hora (2020)
through a semi-automated computational analysis of
Spitzer/GLIMPSE data. This filamentary structure, as
observed in absorption, spans about 28 pc at the dis-
tance of 4.66 kpc and exhibits a disruption of nearly 3.8
pc at the location of the bubble N59-North. This ex-
tended filamentary structure has not been extensively
studied to date. To confirm its existence as a single en-
tity, we analyzed the GRS 13CO(J = 1–0) line data and
generated an integrated intensity (moment-0) map over
the velocity range of [94.5, 107.3] km s−1. Figure 1c dis-
plays the GRS moment-0 map, which reveals the molec-
ular gas associated with the IRDC and highlights a sim-
ilar filamentary morphology. The moment-0 map is also
overlaid with the positions of the ATLASGAL 870 µm
continuum clumps (see stars in Figure 1c), situated at
same distance (∼6.5 kpc) and exhibiting velocities be-
tween [99.2, 103.9] km s−1 (from Urquhart et al. 2018).
The alignment in velocity range and distance of the AT-
LASGAL clumps along the filamentary structure con-
firm its existence as a single physical entity, despite ap-
parent disruptions near N59-North.
Yang et al. (2018) studied the outflow activity associ-
ated with the ATLASGAL clumps using the CHIMPS
13CO/C18O(J = 3–2) line data.
Clumps exhibiting
outflow activity are indicated by black stars in Fig-
ure 1c. No outflow activity was detected by Yang et al.
(2018) for the ATLASGAL clump at l = 33.◦134. The
C18O(J = 3–2) emission observed toward the clump
at l = 33.◦238 was insufficient to search outflow activ-
ity. These two clumps are marked in magenta in Fig-
ure 1c. The physical paremeters of these ATLASGAL
clumps are listed in Table A1. Notably, the ATLAS-
GAL clump located at l = 33.◦288 (hereafter, ATL-5)
is situated at the center of the filamentary cloud. To
determine whether these clumps satisfy the empirical
mass–size criterion for MSF, we have plotted the mass
of the ATLASGAL clumps against their effective radius
(see Figure 2). In Figure 2, the blue dashed line rep-
resents the Kauffmann & Pillai condition for MSF, ex-
pressed as M(R) = 870 M⊙(R/pc)1.33 (Kauffmann &
Pillai 2010). Urquhart et al. (2018) adjusted the mass
coefficient by a factor of 1.5 to account for the differ-
ence in dust absorption coefficient used in their study.
This modification yields the modified Kauffmann & Pil-
lai criterion (referred to as mKP-10) for MSF, defined as
M(R) > 580 M⊙(R/pc)1.33 (see Urquhart et al. 2018).
The white area above the gray-shaded region in the plot
represents clumps that satisfy the mKP-10 condition. It
is important to note that all ATLASGAL clumps meet
the mKP-10 criterion for MSF, even after their masses
and effective radii are adjusted to the distance of 4.66
kpc.
3.2. Investigation of a HFS candidate, C-HFS
Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that ATL-5 meets the
empirical mass–size criterion for MSF. However, no
MAGPIS 20 cm continuum emission is detected to-
ward this clump.
