illustrated in Fig. 2. Generally, the measurement process is denoted as MA|X, a map depending on the
specific X = x and A = a. A Bell test serves as a causal instrument, represented by an inequality that
must be satisfied to ensure the compatibility of certain causal structures, e.g. in Fig. 5 with the statistics
p in the affine subspace of correlations of dimension 8 [18](for example replace p from Fig. 2b in Eq. (5)
gives Eq. (42)).

Figure 5: Bell-test causal structure – directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with nodes for random variables and arrows for

with 5b where nonlocal correlations arise from the entangled state; for v ≤1 the nonlocal correlations in 5c come from a
post-quantum common cause (correlations stronger than quantum are represented as a wavy connection between A and B,
but satisfying no-signalling); for v > 1 faster–than–light signals are allowed, e.g. X directly influences B or between A and
B (the wavy connection can signalize).
(LHV) model. The node A (B) represents the output random variable and is influenced only by classical
random variables X and Λ (Y and Λ). Therefore pA|XΛ and pB|Y Λ are the probability distributions
associated with variables A and B, influenced respectively by X, Λ and Y, Λ. The distributions PX, PY ,
and PΛ represent the probability distributions of X, Y , and Λ, respectively. BI can be obtained from the
causal structure in 5a. Locality means that no arrow occurs between the two cones of Fig. 2, i.e. between
{A, X} and {B, Y }. Then:
pAB|XY Λ = pA|BXY Λ pB|XY Λ
Loc

Note that this condition also implies no-signaling

Therefore the entries of the local correlation p are the marginal of pABΛ|XY = pAB|XY ΛpΛ. From (6)

The common source is described by a joint probability distribution PΛ(λ) = PΛAΛB(λA, λB). Note that,
local correlations pAB|XY can be reproduced by parties equipped only with shared randomness in pΛ
so that Alice (Bob) samples from the distribution PA|XΛ (PB|XΛ). Λ can be any system with arbitrary
dimension but for A, B, X, Y ∈{0, 1}, the cardinality of Λ is 16 (see [117] min. 48:30).
Definition 1 (Realism). The outcome of A represents an element of reality, namely it satisfies the realism
condition if it is pre-determined by a function f(X, ΛA)
real
= A. This can be rewritten as λA(X) = A once
redefining f = λA as a pre-existing outcome of ΛA.
The role of the measurement process, once X is chosen, is to select a specific function MA|X =
λA(X) = A. Given that X is dichotomous, the possible functions are λA ∈{r0, r1, fp, id} represent all
possible deterministic functions (discard and replace a 7→rk(a) = k, flip a 7→¯a and identity a 7→a)
unveiling a pre-defined element of reality. Similarly, for NB|Y = λB(Y ) = B, thus with the assumption
of realism, Eq. (8) becomes:
