: Transient effect of the hysteresis response in TBG
As shown in Figure 3b of the main text, measured longitudinal magnetoresistance transiently relaxes to a
steady state magnitude of Rxx when we stop sweeping the magnetic field at a given B||stop. As highlighted
in the main text, the transient recovery behavior after the ‘stop interval’ are markedly different for two
different sweeping protocols. Below we elaborate on this behavior for different B||stop values.
I. Transient/ Time series experiment protocol in hysteresis
1. Choosing a point in the accessible filling factor, ν, phase space where we see a fully developed BMR
response, i.e., magnetoresistance hysteresis, with a significant magnitude of ∆Rxx.
2. We magnetize and de-magnetize the sample by performing a closed loop cycle of +B|| →−B||
(+300 mT to −300 mT) and −B|| →+B|| (−300 mT to +300 mT).
3. We start ramping the magnet from B|| = +300 mT towards −300 mT, but instead of completing the
forward sweep, we stop the magnet ramping at different magnetic field values designated by B||stop.
4. We sit at B||stop for 300 seconds (‘stop interval’) and keep measuring continuously Rxx with time, t,
at that ν with the applied in-plane magnetic field of B||stop during that interval.
5. After the interval of 300 seconds the magnet is again started ramping; this can be performed in two
ways: (i) we ramp backward, i.e., B||stop →+300 mT, (ii) we can complete the forward sweep from
B||stop →−300 mT.
Below we discuss the results of these transient experiments.
II. Transient behavior of Rxx in +300 mT →B||stop →+300 mT
SI-Fig. 5a-f show the results for the time series measurement for different B||stop values at ν = 2.2.
We have plotted the measured Rxx (top panel), B|| (middle panel), and temperature of dilution MC plate,
TMC (bottom panel) with time, t, adding the 300 second stop interval for each B||stop. The inset in the Rxx
vs. t plots show the Rxx vs. B|| trace along the sweep direction of +300 mT →B||stop →+300 mT. SI-Fig.
5a shows Rxx, B|| and TMC with time, t, for B||stop = 0. We see that even though in the continuous sweep
Rxx follows the path of RFW
xx (B||) (at a given ν) continuously, as soon as we stop ramping and hold the
magnet at B||stop, Rxx quickly starts decreasing and settles at a steady state value 5 in a very short time scale
within the stop interval of 300 seconds. When we re-start ramping the magnet in the B||stop →+300 mT
direction, we recover a peak in the Rxx. We observe that the magnitude of Rxx peak depends on the B||stop,
