tiquarks ¯q¯q in T +
cc(3875) with two light diquarks [qq][qq]
would yield a hexaquark configuration (ccqqqq), poten-
tially mirroring properties of its tetraquark counterpart.
Establishing such connections theoretically reveals uni-
versal features of multiquark systems, including poten-
tial shared properties like binding mechanisms and decay
modes. Experimentally, it provides guidance for detect-
ing elusive hexaquarks by leveraging known tetraquark
signatures.
In this work, we systematically investigate the doubly-
charmed hexaquark system ccqqqq (q = n, s; n = u, d)
using the Gaussian expansion method within the frame-
work of the constituent quark model. Our calculations
include: the mass spectra for all flavor configurations,
corresponding internal mass contributions, root-mean-
square (RMS) radii, and partial (total) decay widths.
The paper is organized as follows. After the Introduc-
tion, Section II details the theoretical framework, includ-
ing the effective Hamiltonian, hexaquark configuration,
and the calculation methods for root-mean-square radii
and two-body strong decays.
Then in Section III, we
present results for mass spectra, internal structure, and
decay properties. Finally, the key findings and implica-
tions for future studies are summarized in Section IV.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR
DOUBLY-CHARMED HEXAQUARK SYSTEM
A.
The effective Hamiltonian
In the constituent quark model, the nonrelativistic
Hamiltonian incorporates three key components to de-
scribe quark interactions and calculate the properties
of ground-state hadrons: a linear confinement potential
(modeling long-range quark confinement), a Coulomb-
like potential (accounting for short-range chromoelectric
interactions), and a hyperfine interaction potential (aris-
ing from spin-dependent forces). The Hamiltonian is thus
expressed as:
H =

Here, mi represents the mass of the i-th constituent
quark; Ti = p2
i /(2mi) stands for the kinetic energy of
the i-th quark; Tcm denotes the center-of-mass kinetic
energy of the corresponding hexaquark system; and λc
i is
the SU(3) color operator associated with the i-th quark.
The confinement potential V Con

and spin-spin interac-
tion potential V SS

are defined as

where rij = |ri −rj| is the interquark distance between
the i-th and the j-th quarks, and σi denotes the SU(2)
spin operator of the i-th quark. The parameters r0ij and
κ′ incorporate explicit mass dependence
r0ij = 1/(α + β mimj
mi + mj
),
κ′ = κ0(1 + γ mimj
mi + mj
).

The numerical values of the parameters in Eqs. (2)-
(3) are listed in Table I. For completeness, the table also
includes the calculated mass of singly-charmed baryons
within the heavy-quark-diquark configuration, alongside
their experimental values for comparative analysis.

Hexaquark configuration
When two light quarks are treated as a tightly bound
diquark, the doubly-charmed hexaquark system reduces
to a four-body system in the [diquark-diquark]-[quark-
quark] configuration.
The total wave function comprises flavor, spatial, color,
and spin components.
In the flavor structure, six dis-
tinct flavor configurations exist for the doubly-charmed
hexaquark system:
[nn][nn]cc,
[ss][ss]cc,
[ns][ns]cc,
[nn][ns]cc, [nn][ss]cc, and [ns][ss]cc.
In the color structure, a diquark in the color-antitriplet
representation ((qq)¯3c) is considered “good” due to its
attractive confinement potential, while the color-sextet
(qq)6c (“bad” diquark) exhibits repulsive interactions.
Only color-singlet configurations are physically admissi-
ble. The color decomposition proceeds as:
([3 ⊗3] ⊗[3 ⊗3]) ⊗(3 ⊗3)
= ([¯3 ⊕6] ⊗[¯3 ⊕6]) ⊗(¯3 ⊕6) →(¯3 ⊗¯3) ⊗(¯3 ⊕6)
= (3 ⊕¯6) ⊗(¯3 ⊕6) = (3 ⊗¯3) ⊕(¯6 ⊗6) ⊕· · ·
(4)
From Eq. (4), two color-singlet configurations emerge:
Ψ1 = |[(qq)
¯3c(qq)
¯3c]3c(cc)
¯3c⟩,
Ψ2 = |[(qq)
¯3c(qq)
¯3c]
¯6c(cc)6c⟩.
(5)
In the notation |[(q1q2)¯3c(q3q4)¯3c]color1(cc)color2⟩, color1
and color2 stand for the color representations of diquark
pair and charm-quark pair, respectively.
In the spin structure, the system admits 20 spin con-
figurations. The general spin wave function is expressed
as |[(q1q2)spin1(q3q4)spin2]spin3(cc)spin4⟩spin5, where spin1
and spin2 represent the spins of the light diquarks (q1q2)
and (q3q4), respectively. While, spin3 and spin4 are the
total spin of charm-quark pair (cc) and diquark pair
[q1q2][q3q4], respectively.
Finally, spin5 represents the
total spin of the doubly-charmed hexaquark state. All
possible spin wave functions are tabulated in Table II.
Based on the symmetrized configurations of flavor,
color, and spin spaces, we systematically construct
