Introduction
Two dimensional integrable models play special roles in many branches of physics. In particle
physics they serve as toy models, where strongly interacting, non-perturbative effects can be
tested in simplified circumstances. In some fortunate situations they can even solve four dimen-
sional quantum gauge theories exactly [1]. In statistical physics they provide paradigmic models
where fundamental questions related to phase transitions, thermalization or non-equilibrium dy-
namics can be exactly analysed. Besides the theoretical interest they can also describe strongly
anisotropic solid state systems and show up in cold atom experiments [2, 3].
One of the simplest interacting integrable models is the Lieb–Liniger model [4], which de-
scribes the pointlike interaction of one dimensional bosons. This model served as a guiding ex-
ample of statistical physics, being simple enough to be exactly soluble and complicated enough
to describe non-trivial, in some cases even typical behaviour. This model was the first, where
new ideas and methods were developed and tested the first time. The model was solved by
Bethe ansatz and the ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit was determined in terms
of a linear integral equation [4] supporting Bogulyubov’s theory. The finite temperature prop-
erties in terms of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz were developed in [5], which sparked a lot
of interest and research. The investigation of other observables, such as correlation functions,
initiated fundamental developments and an arsenal of new methods [6], which were later used in
many other circumstances. The Lieb–Liniger model is not only a useful toy model of academic
interests, but it can be actually realized in cold atom experiments [2, 3].
One of the main observables is the rapidity density in the zero temperature groundstate,
which satisfies a linear integral equation. Its zeroth moment provides the density, second moment
gives the groundstate energy density, while higher moments are related to the expectation value
of higher conserved charges. The rapidity density also controls the asymptotic behaviour of the
correlation functions [7, 8]. Surprisingly, the very same quantity is directly related to the surface
charge density of the coaxial circular plate capacitor [9]. It also appears in the relativistic O(3)
sigma model, in the case when the model is coupled to an external field. It describes the rapidity
density in the groundstate, when the field is large enough and particles condense [10].
There is no hope to solve analytically the linear integral equation for the rapidity density.
It is straightforward, however to perform a low density expansion. The resulting series has a
finite radius of convergence and gives a good approximation for modest densities. The large
density expansion of the rapidity density is a notoriusly difficult problem, which was achieved
only recently [11, 12] based on the pioneering results of Volin for the O(N) non-linear sigma
models [13, 14]. This expansion, however is only asymptotic, which signals non-perturbative,
exponentially suppressed corrections. The complete answer for the physical quantities is a double
series, i.e. a transseries, which goes in the perturbative and the non-perturbative corrections.
These corrections were analysed in details for relativistic observables in the related O(3) model
in [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. The aim of the present paper is to develop the analysis of the
non-relativistic observables to the same depth. These include the complete determination of the
trans-series for the moments of the rapidity density and the investigation of its properties.
The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we revise the perturbative large density
expansion in terms of the Fermi momentum of the particles, and generalize it to the higher
