FIG. 3. The globally-aggregated weighted widths WdT shown hour-
by-hour for the two quiet days in 2022, i.e. 006, 007. In (a) we bin
the dTEC events in two-hour slices “D” by UTC, but in (b) we show
them by local/solar time two-hour slices “S”. Widths are indicated
for each magnetic latitude zone individually, and smaller markers
indicate widths based on poorer fits to the data.

FIG. 4. The globally-aggregated weighted widths WdT shown hour-
by-hour for a ten-day period in November 2022. In (a) we bin the
dTEC events in two-hour slices by UTC, but in (b) we show them by
local/solar time. Although these plots contain a great wealth of detail,
here we only intend them to indicate general trends and behaviours.
The take-home message here is simply the increased regularity and
periodicity of the local time data slices, especially at low latitudes.
Widths are indicated for each magnetic latitude zone individually and
smaller symbols indicate poorer fits.
LT version also moderates the effect of the uneven geographic
sampling.
Notably, we see here that the LT classification is likely to be
invaluable when (e.g.) making predictions based on day/night
cycles. However, the recasting into LT does obscure tempo-
rally localised events (e.g. in 2022 doy 311 on Fig. 4, and
2023 doys 113/114 on Fig. 5 ) are obscured.
This use of local time aggregation is most useful when look-
ing at a global picture, but it is also possible to break down that
coverage into magnetic latitude and longitudes, as we do in the
next section. However, it is also possible to disassemble the
distribution widths themselves into their gaussian, exponen-
tial, or power-law subcomponents. Such detailed breakdowns
will be discussed elsewhere, but in the following we will con-
centrate on latitude and longitude divisions, and in a log scale
index based on the fitted widths that will aid end-user inter-
pretation.

LOG-SCALE INDEX: LdT
Although it is scientifically interesting to look at a very
detailed breakdown of the dTEC statistics, what a forecaster
or end-user will want to know is arguably restricted to two
things: how bad is it (was it) in general, and what was it like
at worst? The distinction is relevant since GNSS-effective ac-
tivity tends to be localised, all-longitude averages typically
contain large regions of low activity even on active days, thus
meaning an average measure does not represent the actual
strength of the disruption where it was strongest. Accordingly,
although an average activity measure is nevertheless useful,
we also would like to know the maximum, albeit being under
the caution that relying on a single fitted width might some-
times be misleading and that some longitudes have better cov-
erage than others. Further, since we are now interested in tem-
porally localised behaviour, here we show results based data
arranged by UTC and not by local time, although this is not a
requirement for computing an LdT measure.
Although the combined width measures WdT or WdT∗are
scientifically useful, being in units of dTEC/s, for more gen-
eral usage it is likely that a logarithmic scale, could pro-
vide a better summary for any wider audience. This is be-
cause logarithmic scales can encompass a wider range of ac-
tivity without a similarly wide range of values, where the
wide range provides detail unnecessary and distracting for the
non-specialist. Further, careful choice of scaling can reduce
our new logarithmic“LdT” activity measure (defined below) to
easily-quotable integer values, removing the need to quote ac-
tivity using decimals, such as we would have to do if quoting
WdT values.
As noted above, choosing appropriate scalings will help
make the LdT values more user-friendly. Here we pick a scale
intended to have a minumum value of 0 – except, possibly,
under extremely quiet conditions – and which increments by
2 for each doubling in width. Note, however, that here any
"user experienced effects" most directly related to our dTEC
index will be positioning error and scintillation strength; but
this index has not yet been formally calibrated against those.
We saw previously that the G2E fitting process returns three
