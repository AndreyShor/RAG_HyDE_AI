influence. Additionally, we applied this approach to evaluate brain activity and demonstrated its 
utility in monitoring rCBFi changes in a healthy subject. With further hardware improvements 
(e.g., wider lag ranges, faster readouts), more extensive noise modeling, and expanded training 
datasets (including more noise levels), we anticipate even more accurate and robust performance 
in the future.
