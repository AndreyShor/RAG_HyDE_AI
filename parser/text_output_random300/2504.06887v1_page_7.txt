the left and right exteriors of the event horizon, in this state, to be connected by an Einstein-Rosen bridge which makes
them entangled. To define this state, one quantizes the field using modes in terms of positive frequency with respect to
both past and future horizon generators ∂U and ∂V . The energy-momentum tensor here has a relatively low magnitude
[61], and the geometry closely resembles the classical Schwarzschild solution. Additionally, a static observer far from the
event horizon experiences both outgoing and ingoing fluxes of radiation in thermal equilibrium.
Since all two-dimensional metrics are related by conformal transformation, imposing the condition of conformal
invariance of the action (5) for a massless Dirac field (m = 0), for which the field should transform as ψ →Ω(1−n)/2(x)ψ
under a conformal transformation of the metric, gµν(x) →Ω2(x)gµν(x), allows one to write down a two-point function,
Eq.(15), in the metric given in Eq.(3), using the known two-point function in Minkowski spacetime. We can also get the
same by substituting 2-beins 3

Here and throughout, we introduce a second subscript in W α
ψ , i.e., W α
ψ,c, to indicate which 2-bein is being used. The
timelike component of the 2-bein shown in Eq.(17) represents the four-velocity of a reference frame that is neither freely
falling nor static (see Fig 1). Converting the four-velocity in t-r plane by usual tetrad transformation and integrating
one gets the following trajectory:

with proper acceleration

(20)
where r∗= r + Rs ln |r/Rs −1| is the usual tortoise coordinate and C1 is an integration constant.
For illustration
purposes, we show the plots for trajectory and acceleration for a particular C1 in Fig. 1.
However, the choice of reference frame at any specific point in a curved manifold is entirely arbitrary. One can apply
a local, spacetime-dependent Lorentz transformation to Eq.(17) to obtain a 2-bein describing the same geometry but
whose zeroth component represents the four-velocity of a desired reference frame. The 2-bein corresponding to a static
observer in the metric Eq.(3) is given by:
bµ
0 =


1−Rs/r

The above 2-bein is related to Eq.(17) by just a local Lorentz transformation. Using the 2-bein, Eq.(21), in the Eq.(99),
we obtain the following two-point function for the scalar density of the Fermionic field in the HHI vacuum:

where ∆U = (U −U ′) and ∆V = (V −V ′). The 2-bein moving with a freely falling detector is given by
