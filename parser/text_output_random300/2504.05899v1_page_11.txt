experimental transmission spectrum. A slight deviation is observed between the resonance
frequencies obtained from the experiment and simulation at higher resonance modes, the
origin of which is unknown. Additionally, note that the current density used in the main
text analysis represents the spatial average over an area of approximately 200 × 100 nm2
adjacent to the corner to avoid the effects of current crowding in the simulation (Fig. S2(d)).

Electromagnetic field simulation.
(a) Resonator shape used in the simulation.
The
red waveguide is a perfect conductor, and the green nanowire is a superconductor with a sheet
inductance due to the kinetic inductance. The simulation environment is also shown. (b) Simulated
resonance frequencies of the first mode as a function of the total kinetic inductance of the nanowire.
The data are fitted assuming fr ∝1/√Lk. (c) Simulated transmission spectrum of the resonator
for Lk = 0.65 µH (red line) compared with the experimental transmission spectrum (blue line).
(d) Treatment of current crowding at the corner. The normalized current density, averaged over a
200 × 100 nm2 area, is used for the analysis in the main text.
