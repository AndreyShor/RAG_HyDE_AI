FIG. 3. Top: contributions to the differential decay rate of
the dominant ¯cs and ¯cd channels (multiplied by the squared
moduli of the corresponding CKM elements), shown together
with a cubic-spline interpolation to the simulated momenta.
Middle/Bottom: error budgets for the ¯cs and ¯cd channels, re-
spectively. Red and blue points represent the total (∆tot) and
statistical (∆stat) errors, while the green, purple, yellow, and
black points represent the error associated with the infinite-
volume (∆L), continuum-limit (∆a), σ 7→0 (∆σ) extrapola-
tion, and with the HLT-reconstruction (∆HLT), respectively.
The dominant source of error is statistical.

FIG. 4. Comparison between the experimental results from
Refs. [32–34, 44] and our theoretical prediction (red points),
for the decay rate (left-panel) and for the first (middle-panel)
and second (right-panel) lepton moment.
sults by the CLEO and BES-III collaborations are:
M CLEO
1
= 0.456(11) GeV,
(11)
M BES−III
1
= 0.439(9) GeV,
(12)
M average
1
= 0.446(7) GeV,
(13)
for M1, and
M CLEO
2
= 0.239(12) GeV2,
(14)
M BES−III
2
= 0.222(5) GeV2,
(15)
M average
2
= 0.2245(46) GeV2,
(16)
for M2. We have obtained these results by repeating also
in the case of the BES-III data the analysis performed in
Ref. [44] in the case of the CLEO results. Like for the
decay rate, the agreement of our theoretical predictions
of Eq. (7) with the experimental results is excellent, as
the middle- and right-panel of Figure 4 show.
A complementary analysis that can be carried out is to
convert the comparison between lattice and experiments
into a determination of the CKM matrix elements. In
principle, the relations in Eq. (7) about M1 and M2, af-
ter setting the left-hand side respectively to M average
1
or
M average
2
, can be solved for the ratio |Vcd|2/|Vcs|2. How-
ever, since for both l = 1, 2 the ΓMl,¯cs/Γ¯cs contribution
alone (which is CKM-independent) already agrees with
the experimental result M average
l
within uncertainties
(see Table I), there is essentially no remaining “room” for
extracting |Vcd|2/|Vcs|2 at better than the 100%-level of
precision. In other words, the measured moments are en-
tirely saturated, within errors, by the CKM-independent
part of the theoretical predictions.
This also implies
that, currently, the comparison between lattice and ex-
periments for these two observables remains essentially
unaffected by moderate variations in the CKM param-
eters.
Therefore, since this is the very first time that
lattice QCD confronts experiments on these quantities,
the observed agreement is remarkable.
