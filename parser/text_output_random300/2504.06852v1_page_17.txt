in which ρnm(k, t) = ⟨ψn(k)| ˆρ |ψm(k)⟩is the matrix element of density matrix and vmn(k) = ⟨ψm(k)| ˆv |ψn(k)⟩is
the matrix element of velocity (detail see Appendix C 2 b and Appendix D 1). The density matrix can be expanded
according to the order of the electric field ρnm(k, t) = ρ(0)
nm(k, t) + ρ(1)
nm(k, t). The α-order magnon current can be

is Bose-Einstein distribution.
When bands satisfy εn(k) = εn(−k), Bose-
Einstein distribution satisfy fn(k) = fn(−k). So j(0) = 0.

The first-order magnon current
Because the first-order density matrix can be divided into intraband part and interband part ρ(1)
mn(k, t) = ρ(1)i
mn (k, t)+
ρ(1)e
