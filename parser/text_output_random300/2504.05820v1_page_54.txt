Tools and methodology
Target.
Yadism supports computations with nuclei with mass number A and Z protons as
targets in the scattering process. By acting on the coefficients associated to up and down partons
Yadism implements the isospin symmetry of the form:



c′
u
c′
d


= 1
A



Z
A −Z
A −Z
Z






cu
cd



(2.5)
where c′
i and ci are the effective and the proton coefficient associated with the parton i. This
rotation is particularly useful in the context of proton PDF fitting where it can be used to relate
neutron, deuteron, and heavier nuclear structure functions to the proton ones. In this way,
isospin is used as a first approximation of nuclear correction by just swapping up and down
contribution for the amount specified by the target nuclei. In particular for:
• proton targets (A = 1, Z = 1): up and down are kept as they are.
• neutron targets (A = 1, Z = 0): up and down components are fully swapped, such that
the up coefficient function is matched to the down PDF and conversely.
• isoscalar targets, i.e.
deuteron (A = 2, Z = 1): the effective coefficient functions
are mixed such that c′
u is half the original cu and half the original cd.
Yadism is completely general with respect to the nuclear target allowing a user to provide values
for A and Z as input to the computation. Alternatively, for a number of targets, the name itself
can also be provided as input. The readily available targets are: iron (A = 49.618, Z = 23.403),
used to describe NuTeV data; lead (A = 208, Z = 82), used to describe CHORUS data; neon and
marble (CaCO3) with both A = 20, Z = 10, used to describe respectively the BEBCWA59 [136]
and CHARM [137] data.
Cross-sections.
Yadism supports the computation of both structure functions and (reduced)
cross-sections. In particular, we implement the structure functions:
F2, FL, xF3, g4, gL, 2xg1 ,
(2.6)
where the normalization is chosen such that at LO, all the structure functions are proportional
to different PDF combinations of the form xf(x). Generally, we can write the (reduced)
cross-sections for a DIS process in terms of the structure functions as
σ(x, Q2, y) = N

F2(x, Q2) −dLFL(x, Q2) + d3xF3(x, Q2)

where N, dL, and d3 may depend on the experimental setup or the scattered lepton. The
different reduced cross-sections implemented in Yadism, and their definitions in terms of N,
dL, and d3 can be found in the online documentation. 4 The implemented definitions can be
