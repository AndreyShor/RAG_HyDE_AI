Abstract:
We study the dynamics of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state in a thermal radia-
tion background. Unlike traditional treatments that rely on the Boltzmann equation, we employ
the Heisenberg equation and average it over general quantum states.
In contrast to the usual
Boltzmann-based descriptions, our approach captures the subtleties arising from quantum coher-
ence in different number eigenstates, which is essential for soft graviton modes in the squeezed
vacuum state. Our new method successfully reproduces the previous one-loop results within the
in-in formalism when the expansion parameter is small and deviates significantly as the parameter
increases, indicating that our results extend beyond the one-loop in-in formalism. We examine
the implications of graviton emission effects stimulated by quantum coherence in both flat and
expanding backgrounds. In the flat background, it is found that backreaction of radiation on the
spacetime dynamics is crucial for significant stimulated emission. In the expanding background, to
avoid the subtleties associated with superhorizon modes, we investigate the effect of emission within
the horizon immediately after reheating and find a significant effect. We examined the IR graviton
evolution from a symmetry perspective and propose a regularization prescription to eliminate the
secular growth problem.
