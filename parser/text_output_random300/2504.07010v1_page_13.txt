and cannot be used to calibrate the intervals. More generally, estimating the
empirical quantile of the conditional distribution for any z ∈Z when Z ⊆Rd
is impossible if N < ∞because the probability of having N samples with
z = ZN+1 in the calibration set is zero. (Vovk, 2012). Here we focus on our
specific setup and approximate conditional validity based on two observations
1. We may be able to extract from ˆY an ordinal feature, S = ϕ(ˆY ), such
that
dTV(BCn, BCn′) ∝f(|Sn −Sn′|),
Sn = ϕ(ˆYn),
∂tf(t) > 0
(15)
For example, S may be a weighted sum of a circuit’s depth and number
of interacting qubits.
2. Since the object attributes are distributions, we can infer an arbitrar-
ily high-dimension feature map, ϕ(ˆY ) ∈Rq, such that BC(Yn, ˆYn) ≈
wTϕ(ˆY ) obeys
˜A(ˆY ) = BC(Y, ˆY ) −wTϕ(ˆY ) ∼P ˜
A
for all ˆY
(16)
for some w ∈Rq3
We formalize these assumptions to derive two non-exchangeability mitigation
algorithms in Sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. In the experiments, we combine the
algorithms and test them empirically against a baseline CP algorithm, i.e.
the standard Split CP approach without non-exchangeability mitigation.
2.5.1
Sample selection with an ordinal feature
The idea is to rank the calibration samples according to an ordinal feature
extracted from the output distributions. Assuming the test samples rank
higher, we show that discarding low-rank calibration samples may reduce
the validity gap in (10). In this section, we make the following
Assumption 2.2. Let Y, ˆY and Y ′, ˆY ′ be any two noiseless and noisy dis-
tributions of two devices, A = BC(Y, ˆY ), and A′ = BC(Y ′, ˆY ). There exists
a one-dimensional score, ϕ(ˆY ) ∈R+, such that the Total Variation distance
between A and A′ obeys
dTV(A, A′) ∝|ϕ(ˆY ) −ϕ(ˆY ′)|
(17)
3More formally, ˜A is such that the joint distribution of ˜A and ˆY factorizes, that is
P ˜
A ˆY = P ˜
AP˜ˆY
