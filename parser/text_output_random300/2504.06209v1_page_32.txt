However, for future reference we point out that the proof and in particular the construction of the predictive
agent model can be simplified since, for unifilar source environments, there exist unifilar models whose hidden state
z′ = u(s, z) are a function of the current percept s and the current hidden state z but not of the action. Thus, the
decomposition of Θ in Figure 17 can be replaced by the simpler decomposition in Figure 18 and, in analogy to the
proof of theorem 7, one can show that agtM is predictive.

Appendix G: The extractable work in percept-action loops
In this framework, memory is represented by a physical system coupled to a thermal reservoir at temperature T.
The system possesses a few degrees of freedom, the information-bearing degrees of freedom, which are assumed to
be meta-stable, i.e., their equilibration time τinfo is much larger than that of the system’s other degrees of freedom,
τothers. Information processing on the information-bearing degrees of freedom is carried out through an isothermal
protocol, i.e., a protocol executed at constant temperature T, with a time scale such that τothers ≪τprotocol ≪τinfo.
The protocol has access to a work reservoir for storing (or retrieving) work.

Derivation of work capacity
Let X be a finite set of information-bearing degrees of freedom of an information reservoir [37], pXin an arbitrary
initial distribution over X, and Φ = (ϕ(j|i))j,i an arbitrary transition matrix where i, j ∈X. Then, given that the
available knowledge of about the information-bearing degrees of freedom X is pXin, the work W which one can expect
(with respect to pXin) to extract by implementing an isothermal process realizing Φ on X is upper-bounded by the
second law of thermodynamics as [7, 8]
W ≤H (Xout) −H (Xin)
(G1)
where W is in units of kBT ln 2, and Xout is distributed as
pXout(xout) =
