influence through social networks. Some agents may have shifted into the preg-
nant state due to feedback from their peers, where behaviors such as substance
abuse or lack of contraceptive use spread through social groups, amplifying the
impact of catastrophic factors. Violence, deprivation, and substance abuse play
a roles as catastrophic shocks (Z-axis), increasing over time in the simulation
the risk of pregnancy for some agents, leading to a bifurcation where these
individuals cross a critical threshold and become pregnant. The steep decline
in the cusp surface reflects this catastrophic transition.
Figure 2 (right) shows the system transitioning into a more complex and
dynamic state, with some agents falling into pregnancy due to the interaction
of catastrophic socio-economic shocks and latent factors. The cusp catastrophe
model explains how these agents shift from the stable region (non-pregnant)
to the unstable region (pregnant) when critical control parameters (such as
deprivation or substance abuse) surpass threshold values.
The cusp catastrophe dynamics effectively illustrates the non-linear nature
of fertility dynamics. In reality, teenagers may remain in a non-pregnant state
despite small fluctuations in environmental conditions, but once critical factors
(like poverty or violence) reach a tipping point, pregnancy occurs suddenly and
unpredictably. This illustrates the catastrophic nature of teenage pregnancy
in vulnerable socioeconomic environments, where a combination of negative
factors can lead to dramatic and often irreversible consequences.
In terms of policy implications, the results highlight the need for targeted
interventions aimed at mitigating catastrophic shocks like socioeconomic de-
privation and violence, which, according to the model, play a critical role in
pushing teenagers toward pregnancy. Preventive measures such as improving
access to contraceptives and educational programs, can help maintain the
system in a stable, low-pregnancy state.

Discussion
A fertility catastrophe model—based on Thom’s nonlinear differential equations
of morphogenesis—offers a novel framework for understanding reproductive
health dynamics across macrodemographic, mesodemographic, and microdemo-
graphic levels. This model provides a structured approach to examining both
gradual and abrupt shifts in fertility patterns, emphasizing how systemic latent
factors interact with sudden perturbations to produce non-linear demographic
transitions.
At the macrodemographic level, the model conceptualizes a three-dimensional
catastrophe surface, mapping the interplay between latent fertility deter-
