Figure 1: Schematic diagram of two-dimensional laminar boundary layer under static
magnetic field.
The balance between viscous and inertial forces in the boundary layer is disturbed when
other body forces are present in the fluid. In magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) (Fu et al. 2025),
this body force, also known as the Lorentz force, inevitably affects the dynamic properties
of the boundary layer. Zhang et al. (2011) reduced the steady MHD convergence boundary
layer to the Falkner-Skan equation and derived an analytical solution. For the unsteady MHD
boundary layer problem, Takhar & Nath (1997) provides a numerical solution of the ordinary
differential equation for axisymmetric stagnation flow based on Ma’s Lie group method (Ma
1990). Few scholars have explored analytical solutions for unsteady MHD boundary layer
flow. Therefore, there is a lack of a precise theoretical explanation for the strong magnetic
field’s influence on the boundary layer’s physical parameters.
The second section proposes a Stokes stream function similarity transformation method
applicable to multiple flow types. The third section derives analytical solutions for the
unsteady MHD boundary layer and, based on these analytical solutions, investigates the
scaling relationship between the significant magnetic field strength and the velocity or its
gradient. The fourth section extends the analytical solution to the boundary layer issue of
converging flow under a non-uniform magnetic field. The collective analysis of these sections
will elucidate the physical mechanism underlying the influence of strong magnetic fields on
boundary layer flow.
2. Dynamic Equation
A model of two-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic unsteady boundary layer flow is
formulated. A Cartesian coordinate system 𝑜−𝑥𝑦𝑧is established, wherein the flow is confined
to the 𝑥−𝑦plane as illustrated in figure 1. At time 𝑡, 𝑢and 𝑣represent the tangential (parallel
to wall) and normal (perpendicular to wall) velocities of the fluid, 𝑝pressure, and 𝜙electrical
potential. The Navier-Stokes equation in laminar momentum boundary layer for the viscous
incompressible conductive fluid with Lorentz force and mass continuity equation is written
as follows under a spanwise magnetic field 𝑩= 𝐵𝒆𝒛

where 𝜎, 𝜇and 𝜌denote the conductivity, viscosity and density of the fluid, respectively.
The validity of the aforementioned three equations is contingent upon the large Reynolds
