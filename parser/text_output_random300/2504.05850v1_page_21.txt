GRAPHICAL FUNCTIONS WITH SPIN
21
The star-triangle identity preserves the total weights on the external vertices in four dimensions. Every
vertex has weighted degree four. This implies that the fermion propagator of weight 1+1/2λ = 3/2+O(ϵ)
on the left-hand side changes to weight 1 −1/2λ = 1/2 + O(ϵ) while the boson weight changes from 1 to
1/λ = 1 + O(ϵ). (The full formula, which includes all terms of O(ϵ), has three more graphs on the right-
hand side.) In position space, each application of the star-triangle identity eliminates one integration.
Hence, we want to use the star-triangle identity as often as possible. Because it is not clear in which
sequence and for which vertices we should use the star-triangle identity to get maximum reduction, we
apply the identity in every possible way. However, we do not use it from right to left (as a triangle-
star identity) which, in certain situations, may be necessary to obtain maximum reductions. A similar
situation exists in ϕ3 theory where the graph-theoretic structure of star-triangle reductions was analyzed
in [10].
In this section, we only skim the results for primitive graphs (graphs without subdivergence). The
amplitudes of primitive graphs have a pole in ϵ of order one whose residue is given as a finite integral in
four dimensions. This (primitive) Feynman period (Feynman residue) is universal, it does not depend on
the renormalization scheme. The Feynman period contributes to the corresponding beta function. The
highest transcendental weight part of the beta function at a given loop order only comes from primitive
graphs.
Feynman periods can be calculated in exactly four dimensions (ϵ = 0). In the presence of conformal
symmetry this simplifies their computation. This compensates somewhat for the intrinsic difficulty of
primitive graphs. Still, the calculation of Feynman periods is often the hardest step in completing a loop
order. In ϕ4 theory and in six-dimensional ϕ3 theory, e.g., it was possible to calculate the beta function
to the highest loop orders in which all Feynman periods are known (7 loops and 6 loops, respectively
[21, 25]).
There exists a long history of calculating Feynman periods in ϕ4 theory [4, 15].
Mathematically,
Feynman periods are particularly interesting. They are conjectured to be a comodule under the motivic
Galois coaction [11, 8, 9], which led to the discovery of motivic Galois structures in QFTs (the cosmic
Galois group).
The purpose of this section is to show that the concept is consistent and efficient in a non-trivial
physical QFT. We chose Yukawa-ϕ4 theory because, due to conformal symmetry, one has a large class
of constructible completed graphs (see Section 11.2). We hence get more results in higher loop orders.
The complete theory of graphical functions in primitive Yukawa-ϕ4 theory is quite intricate and will be
presented in a separate article.
11.1. Inversion. We consider the following inversion on x ∈RD,
(103)
x 7→˜x = x
x2 ,
which keeps the direction of x but reverses its length, ||x|| 7→1/||x||. For any weight ν ∈R this leads to
the identities
(104)

||˜x −˜y||2λν 7→||x||2λν

||x −y||2λν ||y||2λν
for spin 0 and
(105)
˜x/ −˜y/
||˜x −˜y||2λν+1 7→−ˆx/ ||x||2λν
x/ −y/
||x −y||2λν+1 ||y||2λν ˆy/
for spin 1/2. Here, ˆx = x/||x|| is a unit vector, so that ˆx/2 = ˆy/2 = 1. If the fermion vertex does not carry
a γ-matrix (like in Yukawa theory but unlike QED), then the left and right factors ˆx/ and ˆy/ square to 1 in
a fermion line and the fermion behaves (up to boundary terms) like a signed boson line. In such theories
we can use inversion to simplify the calculation of Feynman integrals.
11.2. Completion. Inversion was already used by D. Broadhurst and D. Kreimer in [4] to obtain identi-
ties between Feynman periods in ϕ4 theory. This method was systematized in [15]. It was shown that all
graphs that have the same Feynman period by inversion form an equivalence class which can graphically
be represented by a single ‘completed’ graph. In the completed graph the external legs of the vertex
graphs are connected to an extra vertex ∞. After completion we forget the label ∞and all vertices are of
the same type. Completed graphs are 4-regular in ϕ4 theory and 3-regular in ϕ3 theory. Whatever vertex
one chooses to open in a completed graph, one gets primitive graphs with the same Feynman period.
