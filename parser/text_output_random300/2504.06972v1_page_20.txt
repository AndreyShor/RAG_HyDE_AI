Fig. 3 | Quantized anomalous Hall plateaus and superconductivity in 3.83° tMoTe2. a, 
Temperature dependence of symmetrized ρxx (a) and anti-symmetrized ρxy (b) versus νh under 
B = ±0.1 T at D = 0. Both the RIQAH states and the superconducting state have smaller energy 
scale than the FQAH states. c, The zoomed-in view of b, highlighting that ρxy approaches zero 
in the superconducting state at low temperatures. The temperature points in a-c include 100 mK 
to 900 mK in steps of 100 mK, and 1.1 K, 1.3 K. d, Temperature dependence of ρxx versus νh 
at B = 0 and D = 0. The temperature points range from 100 mK to 900 mK, in 50 mK steps. e, 
ρxx map as a function of T and νh at B = 0 and D = 0, showing the superconducting dome. f, 
Linecuts of e at representative νh. The onset transition temperature of superconductivity Tonset 
is indicated by arrows, where the measured ρxx deviates from the projected normal-state 
resistivity (dashed lines).
