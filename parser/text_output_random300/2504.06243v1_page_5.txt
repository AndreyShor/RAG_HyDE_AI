Denoting the scaling dimension of the interaction
R
dDx ηϕ3 by D we have,
D = 3∆ϕ + ∆η −D = D −4 −γ .
(2.7)
Notice that if we are in the vacuum (γ = 0), the interaction is marginal in four dimensions.
Likewise, if γ > 0, the interaction is relevant in four dimensions. Let us therefore suppose that we
are in dimensions greater than four, so that D −4 −γ = 0 and the interaction is marginal. Notice
that (2.6) then gives ∆ϕ = 1, regardless of the spacetime dimension.
2.1. One-loop beta function
Focusing on the ηϕ3 term in the Lagrangian (2.3), in the case that it is marginal, we now
compute the one-loop beta function to determine whether it is marginally relevant or marginally
irrelevant. We do this in the context of Wilsonian RG.
A correlation function of some operator O, which is e.g., a product of fields ϕ and η at some
momenta, is given by the path integral,
⟨O⟩=
Z Y
p
dϕpdηp OeiS .
(2.8)
It is useful to first perform the path integral over all momenta greater than some scale µ, where µ
is greater than the scale of any momenta appearing in O. We denote the resulting action by Sµ,
⟨O⟩=
Z
µ
Y
p=0
dϕpdηp OeiSµ =

dϕpdηp OeiSµ−δµ ,
(2.9)
where in the second equality we further integrated over a shell of momenta µ−δµ < p < µ. We let
the couplings in the action Sµ be labeled by λ(µ). Our goal is to find the behavior of λ(µ).
We now do this explicitly for the ηϕ3 term in (2.3), which in momentum space takes the form,
Sµ = −1
