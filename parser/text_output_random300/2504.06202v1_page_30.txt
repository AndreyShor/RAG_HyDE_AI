Figure 6.2: Illustration of the proof of Lemma 6.4. The grey area is U.
Assumption 1. There exist a0 ∈∂D \ {1} and r0 ∈(0, 1), such that for all C > 0 and ε0 > 0,
there exists ε ∈(0, ε0), such that P[W4(a0, ε, r0)] ≥Cεξ4.
We produce a contradiction under Assumption 1, which will prove the upper bound in Theo-
rem 1.3.
Lemma 6.4. Suppose that Assumption 1 holds. Then for all a ∈∂D \ {1} and r ∈(0, r0/8], for
all C > 0 and ε0 > 0, there exists ε ∈(0, ε0), such that P[W4(a, ε, r)] ≥Cεξ4.
Proof. Fix C > 0 and ε0 > 0. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that a is on the clockwise
arc from 1 to a0, see Figure 6.2 (left). If a is on the counterclockwise arc from 1 to a0, then it
suffices to consider the mirror symmetry of this picture w.r.t. the real axis. Note that the image
of a chordal SLE curve under such a mirror symmetry is still a chordal SLE (whose endpoints are
the images of the endpoints of the original curve).
Suppose a0 = exp(iθ0) and a = exp(iθ) for 0 < θ0 < θ < 2π. Let δ0 ∈(0, min(θ0, 2π−θ)/4). Let
δ1 ∈(0, 1/2) be a sufficiently small quantity that we will adjust later. Let U be the area bounded
between the arcs {eit, θ0 −δ0 ≤t ≤θ + δ0}, {(1 −δ1)eit, θ0 −δ0 ≤t ≤θ + δ0} and the segments
{tei(θ0−δ0), 1 −δ1 ≤t ≤1}, {tei(θ+δ0), 1 −δ1 ≤t ≤1}. Let η be the SLEκ in D from a to 1. Let
E0 be the event that η first exits U through the segment S0 := {tei(θ0−δ0), 1 −δ1 ≤t ≤1}. We
claim that there exists p0 > 0 which depends only on δ0, δ1, a0 such that P(E0) ≥p0. Indeed, by
Lemma 2.6, we can let η stay in some given tube with positive probability. We can choose this
tube in a way that if η stays in this tube, then E0 occurs.
We parametrize η according to its radial capacity, namely |f′
t(0)| = et, where ft is the conformal
map from D \ η([0, t]) onto D which leaves 0, 1 fixed. Let T be its total time length, and T1 be the
first time that η exits U. Let Xt denote the image under ft of the tip η(t). Let T0 be the first time
t that Xt = a0. Let us now prove that on E0, we have T0 < T1 a.s. Note that X0 = a and Xt is
continuous in t. Since Xt ̸= 1 for all t ∈[0, T1], it suffices to show that XT1 is on the clockwise arc
from a0 to 1. To see that latter point, let S be the segment from ei(θ0−δ0) to η(T1) and let A be the
clockwise arc from ei(θ0−δ0) to 1. The length of the clockwise arc from XT1 to 1 is less than 2πω,
where ω is the harmonic measure of S ∪A seen from 0 in the domain D \ (η([0, T1]) ∪S). Indeed,
