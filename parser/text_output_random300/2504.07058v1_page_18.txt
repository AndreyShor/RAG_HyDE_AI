where
𝑅(𝑡, 𝑥) = 𝑒−𝑢(𝑡,𝑥) + 1
2𝑒−2𝑢(𝑡,𝑥).

The exact solution is:
𝑢(𝑡, 𝑥) = log(𝑥+ 𝑡+ 2).

Figure 8 showcases a graphical comparison between the approximate solutions obtained using PINN and the exact
solution for the model given by Eq. (3.5). The results demonstrate that the PINN-based approximation remains
highly consistent with the exact solution, highlighting its stability. Moreover, Fig. 8 clearly depicts the increase in
tumor cell density as time 𝑡progresses. A three-dimensional visualization comparing the PINN and exact solutions
is presented in Fig. 9. Additionally, Table 3 provides the relative error E𝑟
𝐺and training error E𝑇along with the
chosen hyper-parameters. A zoom view of the plot at 𝑡= 0.5 reveals that the PINN prediction aligns more closely
with the exact solution compared to the Fibonacci and Haar wavelet methods [38].
