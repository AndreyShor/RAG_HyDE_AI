Appendix A.2. A Chain of Ising Spins with Exchange Interactions
We consider a chain of 2S classical two-state spins with periodic boundary conditions,
which will be always in one of 22S possible ontological states. The latter are specified by the
two-state variables sk = ±1, k = 1, . . . , 2S, 2S + 1, with s2S+1 ≡s1.
Interactions are defined as transpositions of the two-state variables (spin exchange) of
nearest neighbors:
ˆPij|si, sj⟩:= |sj, si⟩,
ˆP2S 2S+1 ≡ˆP2S 1,
(A5)
with the following properties of the exchange operators:
ˆP2 = 1, [ ˆPij, ˆPjk] ̸= 0,
ˆPij = (ˆσi · ˆσj + 1)/2,
(A6)
where the last equation recalls the relation between exchange operators and vectors formed
by the three Pauli matrices, e.g., ˆσk acting on the spin at site k; a generalization for larger
than two-state spins exists as well.
The dynamics of the chain are then defined by permutations of the chain states which
are generated by multiple applications of the exchange operators:
ˆU :=
S
∏
k=1
ˆP2k−1 2k
S
∏
k′=1
ˆP2k′ 2k′+1 =: exp(−i ˆHT),
(A7)
indicating once more the definition of the corresponding Hamiltonian. The latter can be
obtained analytically as a polynomial in ˆU and ˆU† [23].
We note that, reading the product of transpositions in Equation (A7) from the right to
the left, first, all even transpositions are performed and then all odd ones, which commute
among each other, respectively—here, even/odd refers to whether the first index k in ˆPk<l
is even/odd. This separation of the even/odd transpositions implements a finite signal
velocity in the model, such that a perturbation of a particular spin reaches only its nearest
neighbors in one update step, which is effected by applying the unitary ˆU once on the state
of the chain.
The evolution of an arbitrary initial state of the spin chain is very simple and obeys
a number of conservation laws [23]. Writing down explicitly a few update steps for a
short chain, it can be seen as a composition of Cogwheel like motions of left-movers and
right-movers, concerning the spin variables on the odd and even chain sites, respectively.
Recalling the periodic boundary condition on the chain, we obtain ( ˆU)S = 1 for a chain of
2S spins. The behavior of this cellular automaton is illustrated in Figure A2 (top).
