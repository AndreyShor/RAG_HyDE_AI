where the last term C represents a constant energy shift. In addition to the number operator, we
introduce

(2.18)
The expectation value of L characterizes the coherence between different number eigenstates, which
does not appear in standard kinetic theory formulated in terms of separable number eigenstates.

Heisenberg equation
In this section, we derive the Heisenberg equation averaged over given quantum states. We do
not call this equation Boltzmann equation to emphasize that we retain the quantum field theory
perspective without fully reducing the system to kinetic theory. The following equations describe
the equations of motion for field operators in QFT where the “size” of each graviton is too large to
regard them as point particles.

Free theory
Let us start with the free theory. The free Heisenberg equation is given by
dO
dτ = i[H0, O] + ∂O
∂τ .
(3.1)
In an expanding universe, operators depend explicitly on time via the scale factor, which gives rise
to the last term.
Using Eq. (2.14), we obtain
