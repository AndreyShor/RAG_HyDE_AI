hand, contradictory results were also reported. It was found that radio depressions at the centimeter and millimeter
bands were of a similar scale to Hα filaments, indicating that they were both caused by the absorption of cold and
dense plasma (Kundu & McCullough 1972; Raoult et al. 1979; Alissandrakis et al. 2013; Alissandrakis 2020).
In this paper, we report metric-decimetric radio imaging observations of a quiescent filament eruption using the
DAocheng Radio Telescope (DART, formerly known as the DSRT; Yan et al. 2023). For simplicity, the filament-related
radio brightness depression, i.e., Radio Depression, is adopted in the following. Our observations show that, unlike the
fragmentation of the filament observed at the Hα and EUV bands, the radio depression appears more coherently, even
becoming darker during the eruption. Based on the comparison with a magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of
an MFR eruption, we suggest that the radio depression originates from the absorption of cold plasma and can serve as
a tracer of the erupting MFR. The data and methods are introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, we present the results,
which are followed by a brief summary and discussion in Section 4.
2. INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS
The metric-decimetric radio imaging data are from the DART that operates at frequencies between 150 MHz and
450 MHz. Depending on the frequency, the field of view (FOV) and the spatial resolution range from 7◦and 1′.7 (at
450 MHz) to 20◦and 5′.2 (at 150 MHz), respectively. The time cadence of radio images we used is 10.5 s. DART is a
circular array of 1 km diameter with 313 element antennas, each with an aperture of 6 m. Cross correlation between
each pair of antennas represents a spatial frequency component in the u-v domain. These measurements, referred to as
visibilities, sample Fourier harmonics of the brightness distribution within the FOV. By acquiring a sufficient number
of visibilities (approximately 100,000 in dual polarizations for DART), a solar image can be reconstructed using Fourier
inversion. At present, although the calibration of absolute brightness temperature is still under way, the normalized
brightness temperature is reliable for further analysis after a comparison with the data from the NRH and Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA) (see Section 3.1). Here, the radio image 20 mins before the filament eruption was used to do
normalization. The EUV data are from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The spatial resolution and time cadence are about 1′′.5 and 12 s, respectively. To
trace the evolution of the filament, we also took advantage of the data from the Hα Imaging Spectrograph (HIS) of the
Chinese Hα Solar Explorer (CHASE; Li et al. 2022), which provides full-disk Hα spectroscopic images through the
scanning mode at the Hα band of 6559.7-6565.9 ˚A with the spectral sampling of 0.0484 ˚A and the spatial resolution of
∼2′′ (Qiu et al. 2022). The Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) on board
the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) provides the white-light images of associated CME.
To determine the nature of the radio depression, we also synthesize the radio and EUV images of a simulated filament
eruption. Here, we only consider the Bremsstrahlung emission because it dominates the emissivity of filaments at the
metric and decimetric bands (Nindos 2020). This is justified by the following two facts: (1) the filament-associated flare
is very weak and the population of non-thermal electrons is small; the induced coherent emissions may be insignificant;
(2) the filament eruption is from the region with a relatively weak magnetic field, and thus the gyromagnetic emission
can be further neglected (Shibasaki et al. 2011). We follow Dulk (1985) and Draine (2011) to calculate the radio
radiation as follows: the bremsstrahlung emissivity coefficient jff

Based on the formula above, we use the Radiation Synthesis Tools (Fu et al. 2025) to synthesize the optically thick
images of the simulated filament at the 171 ˚A and 300 MHz in multiple perspectives. The optically thick radiation
synthesis at the EUV passbands is also achieved by RST. More details about the radiation synthesis methods can be
found in Fu et al. (2025).
