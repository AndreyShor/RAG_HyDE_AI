Three-way branching process evolving from a single state at t = 0 to 3t states in

Time periods are labeled by t = 0, 1, 2, . . ., corresponding to physical times τ0 < τ1 < τ2 <

branches in each period t = 1, 2, 3, . . .. At each branching point, the squared norm of the
state vector splits between the branches according to ﬁxed ratios. For illustration, we show
the case of three-way branching (K = 3) in Figure 3.
The Kt decoherent states created by time t can be uniquely labeled by b = (b1, . . . , bt) ∈

We denote the corresponding state vector as ψt(b) with squared amplitude
φt(b) = ⟨ψt(b)|ψt(b)⟩. The squared amplitude of the initial state at t = 0 is denoted φ0 =
