5.2 MFR-OCE on 5% gelatin phantom 
 
Figure 7 presents the results for one of the 5% gelatin phantom samples. To visualize its internal 
structure, a pie cut was made in the 3D maps. The 3D B-mode scan of the phantom is shown in 
Fig. 7(a). The preload from the multi-pronged arms caused small displacements at various 
boundary locations, which can be observed on the phantom's surface in Fig. 7(a). The wave 
fields for each individual frequency were extracted from the multi-frequency reverberant shear 
wave field using bandpass frequency filters, each with a 10 Hz bandwidth centered at the 
corresponding excitation frequency. Figures 7(b) through 7(f) illustrate the 3D reverberant 
shear wave fields at frequencies of 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 2500 Hz, 
respectively. The wavelength in the wave fields decreases as the frequency increases. The shear 
wave propagation originating from the multi-pronged arms is particularly evident. For a more 
detailed visualization of each extracted wave field, a 2D cross-section in the xy-plane at a depth 
of 0.3 mm is shown in Supplement 1.
