passing the test, ts ≤1 −δδ′/(3N). For fixed δ, δ′ we can choose N ≫1, M ∼N 3/4, and ϵ ∼N −1/4 such
that
1 −1/(2MNϵ) < ts ≤1 −δδ′/(3N)

breaks down. If λ in (38) is local, then Eq.(39) holds and Eve’s knowledge is not bounded.
Note that, CHSH in E91 is used to ensure the purity of the shared state. In contrast, in this protocol,
the BI violation limits Eve’ knowledge (vanishing for N →∞) about the players’ systems [55, 215].
However, this protocol has zero key rate (defined in Sec. 3.4) ascribing correlations with noiseless states. A
more practical scheme, but without tackling the most powerful adversary, was proposed in [30] (extended
version [56]) and improved with higher noise tolerance and key rate in [216].
3.4. CHSH Protocol – against individual no-signalling attacks
Individual attacks. While in general attacks, as discussed in Sec. 3.3, Eve prepares a collective state
involving her system and 2n particles sent to Alice and Bob, in the CHSH protocol [30, 56], she is limited
to individual attack, i.e., Eve can only gather independent knowledge about each bit of the key, without
correlating different instances. The following joint distribution characterizes an individual attack
pABE|XY Z = pE|XY ZpAB|XY ZE = pE|ZpAB|XY ZE
(40)
such that when Eve inputs Z (before error correction and privacy amplification) and obtains outcome
E = e, she generates the distribution p(ab|xyze).
Consequently, the following marginal distribution
reproduces the observed correlation p between Alice and Bob with entries
p(ab|xy) =
X
e
p(abe|xyz)
X
e
p(ab|xyze)p(e|z).
(41)
The no-signalling condition in Eq. (7) is applied in pE|XY Z = pE|Z. Being NS a convex polytope,
pAB|XY ZE can be expressed as a convex combination of extremal points, but in Eq. (40), pAB|XY ZE is
taken extremal because individual attacks satisfy two key properties: (i) the interconvertibility property
[146, 145] ensures that extremal points p(ab|xyze) describe the most general individual attack; (ii) local
operations and public communication between Alice and Bob do not enhance their security (for proof
see Sec. 2.C of Ref. [217]). For binary a, b the extreme points {pAB|XY ZE} = pext ∈NS are fully
characterized (binary input [55, 146], arbitrary input [145]). For binary input and output Eve’s strategy
is sketched in Fig. 2c. Let us analyze it in detail.
Proposition 3. For p ∈NS ⊂[0, 1]16 with binary input and output the no-signaling conditions requires
that P
a p(ab|xy) = p(b|y) and P
b p(ab|xy) = p(a|x) so that
