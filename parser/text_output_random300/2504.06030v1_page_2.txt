NQG III - Two-Centre Problems, Whirlpool Galaxy and Toy Neutron Stars

shed new light on galaxies such as the Whirlpool suggesting new places to look for dark
matter. Here we were very lucky to find a quantum Liouville condition (the analogue of
the classical one) making our semi-classical equations easy to solve in terms of elliptic
integrals.
In Section 3 of this work we emphasise the role of “effective potentials” in simplifying
the analysis of the roots of quartics originally due to Cardano et al. Although this
analysis is somewhat intractable algebraically, when combined with ideas on “potential
wells” for fixed energies, it does point up the importance of a convenient time-change,
z. This is the “potential well-time”.
We first encountered this in our work on the KLMN problem for toy neutron stars
and equatorial orbitals. In this set-up for P a unit mass, unit charged particle in the
gravitational field of a µ unit point mass and electro-magnetic field due to a constant
magnetic dipole moment m representing a neutron star centred at the origin O, rotating
about ˆm as axis. For −→
OP = r and dr
dt = ˙r etc., t being the physical time,
¨r = −µr−3r + ˙r × H,
|r| = r,
(KLMN)
with H = 3(m.r)r−5r ± mr−3, ± sign depending upon charge which we assume is
positive. We assume that m.r = 0, m = (0, 0, B), giving the equation of the equatorial
plane.
Taking the dot product with ˙r gives immediately,

So for constant energy, E = ˙r2

Further, taking the vector product with r gives, for m.r = 0,
r × ¨r = ±r−3(r × (˙r × m)) = ±r ˙rr−3m,
ˆm = (0, 0, 1) in cartesians. So for + sign,
