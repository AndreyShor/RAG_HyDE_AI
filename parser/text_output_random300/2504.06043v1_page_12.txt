Fig. 8 The reactions e+e−→J/ψππ (left panel) and e+e−→D∗¯Dπ (right panel) calculated in the molecular model. The red solid line
shows the results of the full model of Ref. [117], while for the blue dashed line the effect of the ψ(4160) was switched of. The data are
from Refs. [18] and [19] for the left and right panel, respectively.
model is employed to connect a predicted P-wave D ¯D∗resonance with the well established X(3872) and Zc(3900) as well as the Tcc(3875)
all having a mass very close to the D ¯D∗threshold.
The key characteristic of a hadronic molecule is that it has a strong coupling to its constituents. Therefore, the nearby pole must lead
to some imprint of the pertinent continuum threshold in observables. This is illustrated in Fig. 8 on the example of two decay channels
of Y(4230). The lines are from a model study that includes the D1 ¯D molecular dynamics—in particular the effect of the D1 ¯D channel
is included fully dynamically [117]. Moreover, the data (also in other channels) called for the inclusion of not only the Y(4230) but
also the ψ(4160). With these ingredients it was possible to describe almost all available data for the Y(4230) with a consistent model.
Especially, no extra exotic state near 4320 MeV is necessary to describe the data, contrary to the analyses of e.g. Refs. [18, 118], since
the highly asymmetric line shape of the J/ψππ channel is generated from the D1 ¯D cut. The line-shape that emerged for the D∗¯Dπ channel
is characteristic for the decay for a hadronic molecule with an unstable constituent having a width of the same order of magnitude as the
binding energy [119, 120].
Typically the interaction of two heavy mesons is in principle modelled analogously to the nucleon-nucleon interaction, reviewed in
Ref. [56]. However, since the data situation is a lot worse than for the two-nucleon system, there is no consensus yet on the most relevant
contribution to the binding potential. While many follow Ref. [4] which suggest that vector meson exchanges should provide the bulk of
the binding [121, 122], others follow Ref. [5] assuming the one-pion exchange as the prime contribution to the binding [123]. Other works
include both mechanism together with others [124–126]—clearly the list of references is not exhaustive.
In addition to model calculations there are effective field theory (EFT) studies for doubly heavy molecular states. It should be clear that
they suffer from less predictive power than model predictions. For example
•
meson-meson and meson-antimeson scattering are not related in an non-relativistic EFT,
•
the short ranged operators for different total isospin channels are not related and thus the existence of e.g. an isovector partner of a
molecular X(3872) can be deduced only from an analysis of high quality data [127] and
•
it is not even possible to exploit heavy quark flavor symmetry for doubly heavy systems [128].
However, EFTs allow one to fully and systematically exploiting the implications of the symmetries of the underlying theory (here QCD) on
the hadronic observables and thus allow for model independent insights. There are in general three different classes of approaches available
in the literature, namely pionless EFT [129, 130], EFT with perturbative pions [131–136], and EFT with non-perturbative pions [137–144].
Again, also those find their analogs in studies of the nucleon-nucleon interaction [56].
One prediction of those effective field theories is that, if the bottomonium like exotic states Zb(10610) and Zb(10650) with I(JP) =
1(1+) are both hadronic molecules with a decomposition B ¯B∗and B∗¯B∗, respectively, then there are necessarily two multiplets of spin
partner states at least in the heavy mass limit, one containing the Zb(10650) and a scalar state, which disappears as soon as finite mass
corrections are included for the B mesons, and one containing the Zb(10650) together with 3 WbJ states, J = 0, 1, 2 [133, 142, 145]. As
spin symmetry violation is introduced into the system, the degeneracy within the multiplets is lifted and the different states get attached to
certain thresholds—see Fig. 9 (while one of the scalar states gets unbound). What is also clear from the figure is that for the spectrum the
pionless and the pionfull theory give very similar results, however, the presence of pions gives the Wb2 a significant width. It should be
stressed that the tight connection between the spin symmetry violation of the hadronic molecules and that of the constituents is a unique
prediction of molecular models.
4 Hidden-charm pentaquarks
Multiquarks are expected not only in the meson sector but also in the baryon sector, where the simplest structures are pentaquarks. The
observation of a broad Pc¯c(4380) and a narrow Pc¯c(4450) [146] in 2015 at LHCb was the first undebated observation of pentaquarks. They
