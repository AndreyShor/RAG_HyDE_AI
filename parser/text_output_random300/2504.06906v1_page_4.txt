bi are the eigenvalues of ˆB and cj are the eigenvalues
of ˆC [56] we conclude that the only eigenvalue of ˆH is
2E0 with algebraic multiplicity α = m.
Our second basic assumption is that each degeneracy
exhibits a dominate EP. The order of the EP, 2 ≤nA ≤
mA and 2 ≤nB ≤mB, can be different. We place no lim-
itations on the geometric multiplicity of each degeneracy,
other than the apparent constraints γA ≤αA −nA + 1
and γB ≤αB −nB + 1, which result from the possible
existence of additional EPs.
We introduce the traceless part of the Hamiltonians
ˆnA :=
ˆHA −E01A,
(18)
ˆnB :=
ˆHB −E01B,
(19)
ˆH′ :=
ˆH −2E01
(20)
with the identity 1 = 1A ⊗1B for the composite sys-
tem. As the spectrum of system A is degenerate with a
dominant EP of order nA, the matrix ˆnA is nilpotent of
order nA. The same logic implies that ˆnB is nilpotent of
order nB.
In terms of the traceless parts, Eq. (1) can be rewritten
as
ˆH′ = ˆnA ⊗1B + 1A ⊗ˆnB.
(21)
With the basic rules of the tensor product [56], we cal-
culate monomials, such as
( ˆH′)2 = ˆn2
A ⊗1B + 2ˆnA ⊗ˆnB + 1A ⊗ˆn2
B.
(22)
Using the binomial coefficient and the nilpotency of ˆnA
and ˆnB, it follows with the auxiliary quantity n := nA +
nB −1 that
( ˆH′)n−1 =
(n −1)!
(nA −1)!(nB −1)! ˆnnA−1
A
⊗ˆnnB−1
B
(23)
and
( ˆH′)n = 0.
(24)
Hence, ˆH′ is nilpotent of order n. Note that the binomial
expansion (23) contains only one term, as all other terms
vanish because either ˆnA or ˆnB appear with an exponent
greater than nA −1 or nB −1, respectively.
Given that the eigenvalues of ˆH′ are zero, the expan-
sion in Eq. (12) is
ˆH′ =
X
l
ˆNl.
(25)
From Eqs. (13)-(14) follow
ˆNj ˆNl = 0 if j ̸= l
(26)
which we then apply in Eq. (25) to obtain
( ˆH′)n−1 =
X
l
ˆN n−1
l
.
(27)
Using the fact that ˆnnA−1
A
and ˆnnB−1
B
are rank-1 matrices
and that the tensor product of two rank-1 matrices is a
rank-1 matrix [56], we conclude that the right-hand side
(RHS) of Eq. (23) is a rank-1 matrix.
And so is the
left-hand side.
This in turn implies that the RHS of
Eq. (27) must be of rank 1 as well. Moreover, since each
of the nonzero ˆN n−1
l
is of rank 1 and the ˆNl are linearly
independent because of Eq. (26), only one such term on
the RHS of Eq. (27) exists. Hence, in the expansion (12)
is an operator ˆNl being nilpotent of order nl = n. This
leads to one of our key results: The composite system
has a dominant EP of order
n = nA + nB −1
(28)
with eigenvalue 2E0.
Since nA and nB are larger or
equal 2, the order n is larger than both nA and nB. For
determining the eigenstate of this EP, we mention that
the image of operators such as ˆnnA−1
A
and ˆnnB−1
B
is the
respective EP-eigenstate, i.e., |ψA⟩and |ψB⟩, see, e.g.,
Ref. [39]. From Eq. (23) we then conclude
|ψEP⟩= |ψA⟩⊗|ψB⟩.
(29)
Additional EPs may be present, but their order must
be smaller than n. The geometric multiplicity therefore
obeys
γ ≤α −n + 1.
(30)
The number of eigenstates of ˆH that can be written as
a tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of systems A and
B is γAγB. If γ > γAγB there are additional eigenstates
that must be entangled.
In our illustrative example in Sec. III we have for sys-
tems A and B the dimensions mA = mB = 2, the EP
orders nA = nB = 2, and the multiplicities αA = αB = 2
and γA = γB = 1. According to Eq. (28) the resulting
higher-order EP has the order n = 3. Since n is smaller
than the algebraic multiplicity α = αAαB = 4, the ge-
ometric multiplicity γ must be larger than 1 and with
inequality (30) we conclude γ = 2 > γAγB = 1. Hence,
there is one tensor-product EP-eigenstate and one en-
tangled eigenstate.
This is entirely in agreement with
the direct calculation in Sec. III.
It is noted that the class of systems considered here
differs from that in Ref. [44].
In the latter, two cou-
pled bosonic oscillators with gain and loss are tuned to
a second-order EP. Populating them with photons leads
to higher-order EPs.
