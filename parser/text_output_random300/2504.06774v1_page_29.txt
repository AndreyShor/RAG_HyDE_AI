Figure 14: Comparison of the predicted temporal evolution of normal velocity compon-
ents for (a) HOSVD (left column) and (b) SVD (right column) across different LSTM
architectures. From top to bottom: LSTM 1 Dense, LSTM 2 dense, and LSTM Time-
Distributed.
Further analysis is conducted on the performance of the predictive models by evaluat-
ing uncertainty quantification for the HOSVD and SVD approaches. UQ provides insights
into the reliability of the predicted snapshots.
Figure 15 presents the UQ results for the velocity components across the LSTM archi-
tectures. In general, HOSVD demonstrates more concentrated error distributions around
zero compared to SVD. For instance, in the 1 dense and 2 dense architectures, the HOSVD
error distributions exhibit narrower and more peaked profiles, indicating reduced vari-
ability and higher prediction reliability. The HOSVD-based LSTM 2 dense and time-
distributed models show the best results with both the components following a normal
distribution profile and a probability of about 80% for 0 error. In contrast, SVD displays
wider and skewed error distributions, suggesting slightly lower accuracy and consistency
