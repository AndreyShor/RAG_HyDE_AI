Supplementary Figure 14. 
Fig. S18. KPFM measurement of device 3 at Vg = 0 V. a, Topography of the tetralayer 
graphene. b, SNOM image of the green dashed area in (a). Domains with distinct 
stackings are labeled by different symbols in color. At Vg = 0 V, the two polar stackings 
(indicated by triangles) show different near-field optical contrast, since this sample is 
hole doped at Vg = 0 V. The stacking assignments in (b) are also supported by our Raman 
spectra in Fig. S12 and the KPFM result in (c). c, KPFM mapping of the same area as 
in (a) at Vg = 0 V. For the two nearby polar stackings, the one that is darker (brighter) 
in SNOM image appears to be brighter (darker) in KPFM, indicative of the downward 
polarization (downward triangle in (b)) and upward polarizations (upward triangle in 
(b)), respectively. The blue dashed line marks the boundary of the ABCB domain, and 
the yellow dashed line marks the boundary of the ABAC domain. The KPFM results of 
device 3 are consistent with those of device 1 (Fig. S6), device 2 (Fig. S10) and device 
4 (Fig. S15). All the scale bars in (a), (b) and (c) are 1 Âµm.
