of annealing eﬀects in HEAs with elemental combinations beyond those discussed in
this review.
In eutectic HEA superconductors, the quinary systems remain underexplored. It
is anticipated that introducing an additional element into NbScTiZr could reduce
ξGL(0), thereby elevating µ0Hc2(0), which is advantageous for practical applications
as superconducting wires. A ﬁner eutectic microstructure generally correlates with a
higher critical current. Achieving thermally induced eutectic microstructures in single-
phase HEA superconductors in the as-cast state could potentially yield ultra-ﬁne
microstructures through precise annealing temperature control.
For improving Jc at higher magnetic ﬁelds, the nanoscale precipitates observed
in
(TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5
and
Nb-Ti
alloys are
promising. However, designing
such precipitates poses signiﬁcant challenges. In Ta1/6Nb2/6Hf1/6Zr1/6Ti1/6 and
Nb2/5Hf1/5Zr1/5Ti1/5 samples synthesized via ball-milling and SPS methods, high-
ﬁeld Jc performance improves relative to arc-melted samples, attributed to Fe-based
intermetallic precipitates serving as ﬂux-pinning sites. The Fe source is the stainless-
steel jar and balls used in ball milling. Similar artiﬁcial pinning sites have been reported
in Nb-Ti alloys. For instance, Mousavi et al. investigated Jc in Nb-Ti synthesized
by high-energy ball milling of Nb, Ti, and Y2O3 powders, where heat treatment at
800 ◦C precipitated Y2Ti2O7 particles (2–5 nm), achieving Jc∼5×105 A/cm2 at 5
T[96]. Thus, the ball-milling method holds the potential for intentionally introducing
nanoscale pinning sites in HEAs.
Higher Tc values than those reported in this review are essential for practi-
cal superconducting applications. Empirically, bcc superconducting alloys follow the
Matthias rule, suggesting that Tc strongly correlates with the density of states, repre-
sented by valence electron concentration (VEC)[97]. Conventional binary and ternary
bcc alloys exhibit a universal trend described by the solid line in Fig. 27. Results
