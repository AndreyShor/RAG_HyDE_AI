Returning to the ϕ(x)4 model, renormalons relate to factorially divergent series6 obtained by
evaluating Feynman diagrams with many insertions of the same sub-diagram (the fish-diagram).
The origin of the factorial n! (where n is the perturbation theory order) stems from the loga-
rithmic high-energy behavior of the fish-diagram (sub-diagram) inserted n times. While we
refer to [31] for a complete derivation of the n! renormalon behavior (see [32] for an alternative
approach), here we illustrate its origin with a simple example. Consider the integral:
Z µ
µ0
log( p
µ0
)nd4p .
(43)
This expression mimics a so-called bubble diagram, i.e. a loop integral with n nested occur-
rences of the 4-point correlator (fish diagram), which has logarithmic UV behavior in standard
QFT.
Renormalons are calculated from the finite part of the loop, so focusing on the finite part of
(43) as µ →∞, we obtain:

−1
4
1+n
µ4
0 n! .
(44)
This suffices to trace the factorial divergence of the series due to renormalons back to the loga-
rithmic UV behavior of the running coupling.
Here lies the improvement provided by dimensional reduction theory. Due to (41), the
behavior for µ →∞is not logarithmic, unlike standard QFT. This suffices to eliminate the
renormalon ambiguities.
It is important to emphasize that the absence of UV renormalons and the absence of the
UV Landau pole are distinct phenomena that need not occur together. Typically, one might
encounter situations where renormalons emerge from the perturbative evaluation of bubble di-
agrams even when the Landau pole is absent due to nonperturbative dynamics, as discussed
in [33, 34]. However, our current framework provides a more comprehensive solution: within
the perturbative approach itself, both the UV Landau pole and renormalons simultaneously dis-
appear, highlighting the theoretical consistency of our model.
A comment is finally in order. In [35], we conjecture that since UV renormalons indicate a
failure of self-consistent perturbative renormalization, they might be reinterpreted as ignorance
of the no-go provided by the Haag theorem. Standard perturbative divergences might also signal
a warning about this no-go, though perturbative renormalization addresses this problem. How-
ever, renormalized perturbation theory needs resummation for self-consistency, which renor-
malon ambiguities prevent. The present work supports this interpretation: we show that when
the Haag theorem’s no-go disappears, so do renormalons (and perturbative divergences).
6Independently of the instantons that notwithstanding leading to a n! large order behavior of the perturbation
theory series, their existence does not imply any inconsistency in the theory, as explained in [29].
