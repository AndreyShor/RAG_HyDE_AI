The second term on the right hand side follows straightforwardly from expanding p2 around E = 0. It should be stressed that the sign of
this term is fixed from unitarity. In other words, the effect of heavier channels on the effective range is necessarily negative and can thus
mimic the presence of a compact component of a studied shallow resonance. In case of the X(3872) or the Tcc(3875) the distances between
the two pertinent thresholds are with δ2=mD++m ¯D∗−−mD0−m ¯D∗0=8 MeV and δ2=mD++mD∗0−mD0−mD∗+=1.4 MeV, respectively, very small,
since both emerge from the isospin violating mass differences between the charged and neutral D(∗)-mesons. Accordingly, the second term
above is e.g. with −1.4 fm for the X(3872) quite sizeable and should be subtracted before the Weinberg criterion is applied. In Ref. [81] it
is argued that the recent analysis of the line shape of X(3872) by LHCb [86] only allows for an extraction of a lower bound for g(1) 2
0
and
accordingly one is to conclude from current line shape studies that the parameters of the X(3872) are fully consistent with a pure molecule.
The underlying physics of the above mentioned range corrections is the exchange of mesons of a finite mass. Mathematically spoken
these exchanges introduce a left-hand (energies smaller than 0) branch-point and with it a left-hand cut (lhc) into the amplitude, located
at [87]

for the exchange of a particle of mass mx and a mass difference of the external particles in the process of the emission of ∆M. This branch-
point introduces a non-analyticity into the amplitude that invalidates the ERE in the simple form provided in Eq. (21). The left-hand branch
point is closest to the physical axis for light exchange particles. Accordingly, the leading lhc in case of nucleon-nucleon scattering (as long
as we neglect the exchange of photons), where ∆M = 0, comes from the one-pion exchange and is located at Eπ
lhc[NN] = −5 MeV—in this
case the ERE can be used to extract the pole of the deuteron located at −2.2 MeV. In case of BB∗scattering, where ∆M=M∗
B−MB=45 MeV
(in the process of a pion emission a B gets converted into a B∗), we get Eπ
lhc[BB∗] = −2 MeV. For DD∗scattering there is no lhc, since
here ∆M=M∗
D−MD=140.6 MeV> mπ and a positive value for Ex
lhc indicates the presence of a three-body cut instead of a lhc. However,
for slightly larger than physical pion masses, as is studied in lattice QCD, the left-hand cut is located very close to the physical axis. For
examply, for mπ = 280 MeV and 1927 and 2049 MeV for the masses of the D and the D∗meson as used in Ref. [88], the left-hand branch
point is located at −8 MeV while the pole extracted from the lattice data using the ERE is located at −10 MeV. Thus, in this case the ERE in
its original formulation should not be employed—see Ref. [89]. Moreover, to extract phase shifts from the lattice energy levels the L¨uscher
method was employed that also calls for a modification in the presence of left-hand cuts [90–92]. Moreover, the pole trajectories in this
case look a lot more complicated than what is discussed in Refs. [67–69] as detailed in Refs. [93, 94].
As demonstrated above, important information on the nature of the state is encoded in the effective coupling g2
0 or, more concretely,
the related residue, gNR(λ2)2, which gets maximal for λ2 = 0. Having that said it becomes clear that only those observables where one
is sensitive to the mentioned residue can be sensitive to the molecular component. However, this is not always given. For example, the
decays X(3872) →γψ, where ψ is either ψ(2S ) or J/ψ, can either go via a D∗¯D →γD(∗) ¯D(∗) →γJ/ψ triangle diagram, which scales with
gNR(λ2), or a contact transition, which does not. The latter type of diagram is necessary to absorb the divergence of the former. Thus, the
total rate of this transition cannot be sensitive to the molecular component of the X(3872) [95] in a model independent way, contrary to
what is claimed, e.g., in Refs. [96, 97]. However, clearly these radiative decays are excellent observables to test model predictions [96, 98–
102] (see also the compilation provided in Ref. [103]). On the other hand for some other decays non-trivial predictions are possible. For
example, if Y(4230) and Zc(3900) are both molecular made of D1 ¯D and D∗¯D, respectively, there is no leading order counter term for the
transition Y(4230) →πZc(3900), which starts at one loop level [104]—see left diagram in Fig. 6. Moreover, this transition is enhanced
by a nearby triangle singularity [105]. If, in addition, also the X(3872) is a D∗¯D molecular state, then the same topology contributes to
Y(4230) →γX(3872) (see right diagram of Fig. 6) such that its rate could be predicted [106]. The prediction was confirmed shortly after
by BESIII [107].
After the quite general discussion about hadronic molecules we now come to the direct implications of a molecular structure for doubly
heavy systems. For the rest of this chapter we focus on the hypothesis that the states studied are in fact purely molecular and ask what
imprint that has on observables. We start with the spectrum. First of all it is important to note that only narrow hadrons can form hadronic
molecules, since typically the widths of the constituents set a lower limit to the width of the molecule [109]—the width can get smaller than
that of the constituents only, if the reduction in phase space provided by the bound state mass being smaller that the nominal threshold of
the constituents is relevant as is the case for the Tcc. Another view on this situation is to acknowledge that the time scale of the formation
of the molecule needs to be much shorter than the life-time of the constituents [110]. Thus we have at our disposal as building blocks for
