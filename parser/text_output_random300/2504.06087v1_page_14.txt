Figure S1: Impact of cutoff on accuracy for H10 hydrogen-chain a) error in absolute energy relative

sampled energies
To investigate the effect of the cutoff radius c on accuracy, we compute energies for H10 hydrogen chains at
inter-atomic spacings d = 1.8 a0 and d = 2.8 a0. This toy system has been used to benchmark many high-
accuracy methods [1] because, despite its small size, even methods like CCSD(T) miss relative energies by up
to 15 mHa. Fig. S1 depicts the errors in absolute energy, relative energy, and energy standard deviation. We
find that all quantities rapidly converge with increasing cutoff, reaching convergence at c ≈3 −5 a0, which is
much smaller than the length of the molecule (16-26 a0). We also find our energies to be in good agreement
with other high-accuracy methods, like FermiNet [2] and AFQMC [1]. For cutoffs c ≥5 a0, we even obtain lower
absolute energies than FermiNet despite being range-limited and having fewer determinants. For the impact of
hyperparameters other than the cutoff, see the ablation study in App. C.
Notably, in a densely packed system and for a sufficiently large nel, the average number of neighbors of any
electron nnb scale linearly in the volume, i.e., O(c3). Consequently, the wave function update sacles O(c9).
We fix the cutoff to c = 3a0 for comparing ionization potentials and singlet-triplet gaps and c = 5a0 when
computing interaction energies to optimize the tradeoff between compute time and accuracy. We found this to
be a favorable tradeoff between the accuracy of relative energies and compute time.

Non-local interactions in hydrocarbons: cumulene
Cumulenes form an interesting test system because they contain long-range interactions. For short chains, the
equilibrium geometry is planar with a singlet ground state. The twisted geometry, with the methylene groups
at each end twisted by 90 degrees, is higher in energy with a triplet ground state. This system has been used to
investigate long-range interactions in neural-network potentials [3], and ethylene, the smallest of these molecules,
has been used as a benchmark system for neural wave functions [4]. We compute the energy difference between
the twisted and planar geometry Etwisted −Eplanar for cumulenes of increasing size from n = 2 to n = 16 carbon
atoms, using the S+ spin operator [5] to enforce singlet and triplet states respectively. Fig. S2 depicts the
energy difference as a function of the number of carbon atoms n, compared to several other quantum chemistry
methods. We find that we can still accurately resolve this energy difference even with a small cutoff of c = 3 a0,
which is substantially smaller than the distance between the two methylene groups. For short chain lengths
where it is possible to run a CCSD(T) calculation, we find our method to be in good agreement with CCSD(T)
with a maximum deviation of 2 mHa.
