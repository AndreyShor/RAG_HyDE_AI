of work capacity. Our framework admits a quanti-
zation by replacing classical channels with quantum
combs, enabling analysis of percept-action loops
in the quantum domain.
This allows for study-
ing fundamental quantum limits on work extrac-
tion and the design of quantum-enhanced agents
[20–23, 54, 55].
More broadly, our work opens the door to a search for
new energetic design principles tailored to percept–action
loops with feedback.
Such considerations may inform
novel organizational principles for biological and artificial
agents [56], moving beyond the predictive paradigm [19,
30, 57].
