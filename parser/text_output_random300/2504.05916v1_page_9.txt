random variables X, Y ∼N (0, 1/2). The coupling matrix Λ would then be said to
belong to the Ginibre ensemble class of matrices [16].
Rather than analyzing the singular value distribution of the coupling matrix
directly, we use the result that the largest singular value of Λ corresponds to the largest
eigenvalue κ1 of the associated Wishart matrix W = ΛΛT. Since the distribution of
κ1 is well-approximated by a known form [17], this approach provides a practical and
accurate way to characterize λ1. Since the singular values of Λ are defined as the square
roots of the eigenvalues of W = ΛΛT, we have:
λ1 = √κ1.
(13)
This transformation allows us to approximate the distribution of λ1 using the well-
characterized properties of κ1.
The approximate distribution for the largest eigenvalue of a Wishart matrix [17]
(see Eq. B.1 for an explicit expression) expresses the eigenvalue distribution of W in
terms of a scaled and shifted Gaussian distribution, itself derived as an approximation to
the Tracy-Widom distribution [18] which is asymptotically exact for n, m →∞. Using
this, we find that the normalised probability density function (PDF) of the largest
singular value λ1 defined for y > 0 (or y > √µ −ρα if µ −ρα > 0,) is approximately
given by

where k = 79.6595, θ = 0.101037 and α = 9.81961 are fitting parameters chosen to
match the first 3 moments of the approximated Gaussian distribution to the type-2
Tracy Widom distribution [17].
The scaling and centering parameters of the Tracy

where U is Tricomi’s confluent hypergeometric function. This expression turns out to
be accurate even for small m, n, however in the asymptotic regime n →∞with m = n,
we recover the result that the average largest singular value scales as
E[λ1] ∼2√n,
(17)
which has also been derived directly via the Marchenko-Pastur distribution of the
eigenvalues of large rectangular matrices [22,23].
Using Eq.
14, we find that the variance of the largest singular values is
approximately given by
Var[λ1] ≈ρ[θ(k + 1) −α] + µ −E[λ1]2,
