cs,tdu,v x1◦s2y1◦t2z1◦u2w1◦v2 = P ,
where P is given by Eq. (11) of Lemma 3.8 with α = 2. Assuming the hypotheses of that lemma
hold, P is irreducible. One cannot write |ϕ⟩as a tensor product |ϕ⟩C ⊗|ϕ⟩D then, for otherwise,
P = polyHAC,HBC(|ϕ⟩C)·polyHAD,HBD(|ϕ⟩D) with each factor being nonconstant, contradicting the
irreducibility of P. Since C and D were chosen arbitrarily subject to the constraints of Case (1), it
follows that |ϕ⟩is S-entangled. It remains to show that the hypotheses of Lemma 3.8 hold in this
case.
Our assumption that CSZ does not simplify on |ψ⟩puts constraints on the coeﬃcients cs,t and
du,v. Since CSZ does not disappear, the expression for |ψ⟩in Eq. (12) must include at least one
term in the sum with all 1’s being fed into CSZ, that is, there is some nonzero term of the form
cs,tdu,v |1 ◦s2⟩⊗|1 ◦t2⟩⊗|1 ◦u2⟩⊗|1 ◦v2⟩.
Thus cs,t ̸= 0 and du,v ̸= 0 for this choice of s, t, u, v.
This matches the hypotheses 2(a, b) of
Lemma 3.8.
We also assume that CSZ does not simplify to CT Z on |ψ⟩for any T ⊊S. Such a simpliﬁcation
occurs when there is some position p ∈S such that |ψ⟩factors into a state with |1⟩on qubit p,
unentangled with the state of the other qubits, in which case we have T ⊆S \ {p}. For this not
to happen then, for every p ∈S, there is a nonzero term in the sum of Eq. (12) whose basis
state |s⟩⊗|t⟩⊗|u⟩⊗|v⟩has 0 in position p. Since S has nonempty intersection with all four sets
A ∩C, A ∩D, B ∩C, B ∩D (because we are in Case (1)), hypotheses 2(c, d) of Lemma 3.8 must
hold. This concludes the proof for Case (1).
Cases (2) and (4) are simpler but completely analogous to Case (1). Instead of using Lemma 3.8,
Case (2) uses Lemma 3.7 and Case (4) uses Lemma 3.6. We omit the details.
Rather than using Lemma 4.3 directly, we will use the following stronger corollary.
Lemma 4.4. Let r and S ⊆[r] be as in Lemma 4.3, and let {A, B} and {C, D} be two partitions
of [r]. Let |ψ⟩A , |ψ⟩B , |ϕ⟩C , |ϕ⟩D be states in HA, HB, HC, HD, respectively. If CSZ(|ψ⟩A⊗|ψ⟩B) =
|ϕ⟩C ⊗|ϕ⟩D, then either CSZ disappears on |ψ⟩A ⊗|ψ⟩B or CSZ simpliﬁes to CT Z on |ψ⟩A ⊗|ψ⟩B,
where T ⊆S is a subset of one of the sets A, B, C, D.
Proof. Let |ψ⟩:= |ψ⟩A ⊗|ψ⟩B and |ϕ⟩:= |ϕ⟩C ⊗|ϕ⟩D. Suppose CSZ does not disappear on |ψ⟩.
If S is a subset of one of A, B, C, D, then we can set T := S and we are done. Otherwise, both
|ψ⟩and |ϕ⟩are S-separable. Therefore by Lemma 4.3, CSZ simpliﬁes to CT1Z on |ψ⟩for some
T1 ⊊S. If T1 is a subset of one of A, B, C, D, then we are done. Otherwise, |ψ⟩and |ϕ⟩are both
T1-separable, and applying Lemma 4.3 again, we get that CT1Z (hence also CSZ) simpliﬁes on |ψ⟩
to CT2Z for some T2 ⊊T1, etc., eventually getting CSZ to simplify to CTjZ on |ψ⟩for some j such
that Tj is a subset of one of A, B, C, D. Set T := Tj.
