The Path to aN3LO Parton Distributions
contributions can be extracted from the high-energy resummation at LLx [308, 309, 310] and
NLLx [311] accuracy. This allows for a determination of the coefficients of the leading

gg and of the next-to-leading

qg . The remaining entries can be obtained from these by using the color-charge (or Casimir
scaling) relation γiq = CF

Although only the leading pole of γgq satisfies Eq. (4.16) exactly, at NNLO this relation is only
violated at the sub-percent level [55], so this is likely to be an adequate approximation also at
this order: this approximation is also adopted in Ref. [300, 302]. An important observation
is that both NLO and NNLO coefficients of the leading poles,
1
(N−1)2 and
1
(N−1)3 respectively,
vanish accidentally. Hence, at N3LO the leading poles contribute for the first time beyond
leading order. The subleading poles can be determined up to NNLL accuracy [293] and, thus, fix
the coefficients of the

N7 ,
1
N6 and
1
N5 subleading poles for all entries of the singlet anomalous
dimension matrix. All these contributions are included in γ(3)
ij,N→1(N) and γ(3)
ij,N→0(N).
In the singlet sector, large-x contributions, whose Mellin transform is not suppressed in the
large-N limit, only appear in the diagonal qq and gg channels. In the quark-to-quark channel
these are already included in γ(3)
ns,+, N→∞(N), according to Eq. (4.12), while γ(3)
qq,ps is suppressed
in this limit. In the gluon-to-gluon channel they take the same form as in the non-singlet and
diagonal quark channel. Hence, we expand, as in Eq. (4.12),

The coefficients Ag

4 are the counterparts of those of Eq. (4.12): the gluon cusp
anomalous dimension was determined in Ref. [294] and the constant in Ref. [295], while the
Cg

4 coefficients can be determined using results from Refs. [313, 300].
Off-diagonal qg and qg splitting functions have logarithmically enhanced next-to-leading power

For l = 0 the coefficients of the higher logs k = 4, 5, 6 can be determined from N3LO coefficient
functions, based on a conjecture [297, 314] on the large-x behavior of the physical evolution
kernels that give the scale dependence of structure functions. The coefficient with the highest
