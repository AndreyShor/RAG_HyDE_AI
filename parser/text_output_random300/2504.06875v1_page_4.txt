casting at high emission angle) and lateral inhomogeneity (like grain boundaries) on depth profiling is considered 
negligible in the following. 
For a comparison, XRR data has been analyzed, as shown in Figure 2f, which yields a thickness of the oxide overlayer 
of 𝑑𝑋𝑅𝑅≈2.5 nm. The layer stack underlying the model and the resulting scattering length density (SLD) plot is shown 
in the inset. It includes an intermediate SnO layer between the film and the substrate’s SiO2 surface, which has been 
confirmed by AES, too, as will be discussed. Although the presumption of the oxide layers significantly improves the 
accuracy of the XRR model, the exact values are highly unreliable, especially as SnO and SnTe have very similar nominal 
bulk (electron-)densities (𝜌𝑡−𝑆𝑛𝑂≈6.29 g/cm3 ≙1.63 e−/Å3 and 𝜌𝑐−𝑆𝑛𝑇𝑒≈6.32 g/cm3 ≙1.59 e−/Å3 according 
to materialsproject.org[27]). There are multiple parametrizations that are physically plausible and still mostly consistent 
with the data (the fit parameters for the model shown in Figure 2f are given in Table S1 in the SI).  
 
Figure 2. Characterization of the SnTe thin film sample: (a) Schematic illustration of the sample cross-section. The depth 
distribution functions of XPS signal intensity are illustrated as red bars for the pristine (blue dotted line) and sputtered 
(green dotted line) sample surface. Mind that the information depth is different for each emission peak and for each 
emission angle.  (b) SEM image of the surface. (c-e) TEM cross-section images. The top image (c) is a magnification of the 
region indicated by the white rectangle in the image below (d), which is itself a magnification of the narrow image below 
that (e). (f) XRR data and model based on the layer stack illustrated in the inset. (g) XPS wide-scan spectra of the pristine 
oxidized surface (blue) and sputtered-etched reference measurement (green). 
The XPS wide-scans in Figure 2g show multiple emission peaks from Sn and Te as well as O 1s and C 1s (adventitious 
carbon on the pristine surface). As a reference, one sample was sputtered, such that its surface contains no carbon 
and oxygen. This allows for an accurate peak assignment, as well as determination of binding energies and line shapes 
of the metallic component peaks. All peak models shown in Figure 3 except for Te 3d, Sn 3d, and O 1s are, to the best 
of our knowledge, novel and have so far not been thoroughly analyzed in existing literature. 
In the pristine sample, the signal contribution of oxidized Sn 𝐼𝑆𝑛2+ is very high compared to that of metallic Sn 𝐼𝑆𝑛0, 
indicating a rather thick SnO layer. The nominal concentration of Te is less than 25 at% at 𝜃= 0° and less than 10 at% 
at 𝜃= 75°. Its signal is completely metallic, indicating that there is no significant amount of Te in the oxide layer. The 
reference spectrum of the sample after sputtering had a Sn:Te atomic ratio of 1:1, as calculated from the Te 3d and 
Sn 3d emission peaks, within the uncertainty of the background subtraction. 
The nominal oxide layer thickness 𝑑 can be calculated using the measured intensity ratio 𝐼𝑆𝑛2+/𝐼𝑆𝑛0 of any given 
emission peak, typically the one with the highest intensity:
