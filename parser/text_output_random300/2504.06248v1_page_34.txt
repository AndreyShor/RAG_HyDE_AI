henceforth considering that all sums run from 1 to N. Given some observable f ∈O, the expression can be rearranged
to yield

From the definition of the Koopman generator (S82), the relation ∂tf = U[f] −P
i Fi∂if holds and implies
[U, v]f = U[ξ]U[f] +

Writing ∂tξ Fi as P
j( ˙ξδij)Fj explicitly gives a sum over the N equations of the infinitesimal symmetry condition:
[U, v] = U[ξ]U +

On the one hand, if the N infinitesimal conditions of symmetry in Eqs. (S85) are satisfied, then
[U, v] −U[ξ]U = 0 .
On the other hand, if [U, v] −U[ξ]U = 0, then

ϕj∂jFi)∂i = 0 .
But each term of the sum over i is independent, meaning that Eqs. (S85) are satisfied and thus completing the
proof.
Remark S27. When ξ(t, u) = 0, the infinitesimal condition of symmetry is simplified to the simple form
[U, v] = 0 .

(S86)
Adapting Lem. S8 for coordinates of time and the N-torus, it is necessary and sufficient that the generator S satisfies
[U, S] −U[ξ(t, z)] U = 0 .
(S87)
It is easy to verify that
S1 = iL0 ,
S2 = K ,
S3 = f(t)U
are Lie symmetries of the Kuramoto dynamics. Note that the time translation generator ∂t is obtained with U −K
and is a symmetry generator, as expected of any autonomous dynamical system. In fact, denoting S = Sξ + Sϕ
with Sξ = ξ(t, z)∂t and Sϕ = PN
ℓ=1 ϕℓ(t, z)∂ℓ, the infinitesimal criterion for the Kuramoto model becomes [U, Sϕ] −
U[ξ(t, z)] K = 0, that is, the form of the condition for autonomous dynamical systems.
