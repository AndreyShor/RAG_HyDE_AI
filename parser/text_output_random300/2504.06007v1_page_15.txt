CAMulator
Figure 11: Annual mean zonal wind at the second model level in CAM6 (middle row) and CAMulator (top row) for
three sea surface temperature (SST) climatologies: 2000+0K (left column), 2000+2K (middle column), and 2000+4K
(right column). The bottom row shows the difference (CAMulator - CAM), highlighting deviations between the
two models. The color scale represents zonal wind speed (m/s), with positive/negative values (red/blue) indicating
stronger/weaker values in CAMulator.
The difference maps (Figs. 11g–i) further highlight systematic deviations, particularly in the North Atlantic and over
regions of strong land-sea contrast, such as the western boundary currents. While these biases remain relatively small
in magnitude compared to temperature biases, they suggest that CAMulator does not fully capture the dynamical
adjustments that drive localized changes in low-level winds. This implies that some aspects of the wind field may be
inherently more difficult for a ML-based emulator to reproduce from CAM6.
Overall, these results indicate that CAMulator successfully replicates large-scale low-level wind features, particularly in
regions where wind anomalies are tightly coupled to SST changes. However, for dynamically driven patterns such as
the NAO, its response diverges from CAM6, potentially due to challenges in learning internally generated variability
from training data alone. Future work should assess whether incorporating additional predictors—such as large-scale
pressure anomalies or eddy kinetic energy—could improve CAMulator’s ability to mimic dynamically driven circulation
responses to warming.

CAMulator Deficiencies, Future Work, and Conclusions
In this work, we introduce CAMulator, an auto-regressive, machine-learned (ML) emulator of the Community At-
mosphere Model version 6 (CAM6). CAMulator is forced by sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and incoming solar
radiation and is explicitly constrained to conserve global mass, water, and energy. It exhibits numerical stability
over indefinite roll-outs and accurately reproduces the surface and integrated atmospheric heating response to within
sample SST variations. The annual climatology is well captured, and dominant modes of variability, such as El Niño
Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Pacific North American (PNA) pattern,
emerge naturally, with slightly muted amplitudes in some cases. Additionally, CAMulator’s physical constraints
alleviate some of the drizzle problem commonly found in traditional climate models (Fig. 8). Beyond these physical
attributes, CAMulator is computationally efficient and differentiable, making it a promising tool for a range of scientific
applications.
