comparatively large 𝛼values, even if they are not optimal.

All QAOA runs were done as follows:
• The parameters were optimized using COBYLA.
• For each circuit, the QAOA optimization loop was ran 10 times, each time with a different starting initial-
ization of the parameters. If 𝑝= 1, these were drawn uniformly. If 𝑝> 1, 9 of the 10 initializations were
drawn uniformly and the other was the best performing (cost wise) initial parameters from depth 𝑝−1.
• The final output of a circuit was the optimized parameters (out of the set of 10) with the largest cost.
• All simulations were computed with a custom QAOA simulator based on [35].
