Fig. S3 Fitted decay spectra. A set of decay spectra, with accompanying fits, acquired with
photon energies either side of the on-resonance condition (ℏω = 245.3 eV).
Fig. S4 Variation of delocalisation time with photon energy. There is a monotonic decrease in
τD with increasing photon energy in this range. We have fitted a linear dependence. Other functional
forms could in principle also be used to fit the data, including an exponential decay in line with
the dependence of tunnelling rate on effective barrier height, but are difficult to justify due to the
magnitude of the uncertainties.
