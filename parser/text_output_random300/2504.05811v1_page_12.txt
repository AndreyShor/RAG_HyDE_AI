good, as shown in Fig. 8. Furthermore, the total χ2/(Ndata −Npar.) is 1.408, demonstrating the
overall high quality of the fitted results. In conclusion, both in terms of individual observables and
the overall picture, the quality of our fitted results is satisfactory. Achieving this is challenging for
coupled-channel fits that involve two different reactions and data sets from various measurements,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our theoretical model.
Moreover, as mentioned in Sec. II, the masses of the molecules are fixed in our theoretical
model. To verify the stability of the fitted results with fixed molecular masses presented above, we
further use this set of fitted values as initial values to perform the fitting with the molecular masses
above the KΣ threshold released. The convergent fitted values for the masses of N(1875)3/2−,
N(2080)1/2−& 3/2−, N(2270)1/2−, 3/2−& 5/2−are listed in Table V. The variation range for
most of these masses is within 100 MeV. Notably, for N(2270)3/2−, its mass varies by only 12
MeV, indicating a particularly strong tendency for N(2270)3/2−to contribute in this region. In
contrast, the variation in the mass of N(2270)1/2−is relatively larger, and as shown in the following
Fig. 5(b), its contribution is also comparatively small, suggesting that the experimental data does
not strongly favor it.

Cross-sections
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 present the theoretical and experimental results for the differential cross-
sections of γp →K+Σ0 and γp →K0Σ+, respectively. Our theoretical numerical results, corre-
sponding to the parameters listed in Table II, are compared with nearly all available experimental
data. Additionally, the individual contributions from s-channel molecule exchanges, s-channel gen-
eral resonance exchanges, and all the other terms—collectively referred to as the background—are
displayed to facilitate the analysis of the reaction mechanisms.
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 present the theoretical and experimental results for the total cross-sections of
these two reactions, along with the individual contributions from single particle exchanges displayed
below. The experimental data for the total cross-sections shown in the figures were not used in
the fitting database, and are just compared with our theoretical predicted results. In addition,
