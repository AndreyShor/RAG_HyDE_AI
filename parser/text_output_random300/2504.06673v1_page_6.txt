as can be directly checked in Fig. 2. Though not scal-
able to more realistic basis sets and/or larger systems,
one can therefore in principle prove the coincidence with
the maximal extrinsic curvature point of the FCI binding
curve.
Outlook—While our study focuses on the simple hydro-
gen dimer, it would be instructive to extend this anal-
ysis to more complex molecules. The methodology we
employed – combining ab initio methods with quantum
resource-theoretic measures – can be extended to other
molecules and more sophisticated basis sets. One could,
for instance, analyze the magic content in a stretched wa-
ter molecule or in a transition metal dimer where multi-
reference character is strong.
We expect that systems
requiring multi-reference descriptions will generally show
non-zero mana.
Furthermore, it is worth emphasizing that the min-
imal STO-3G basis set, despite its simplicity, already
reproduces the correct well-depth of H2 with remark-
able accuracy [37, 39]. This suggests that the essential
physics of bond formation, the delicate balance between
ionic and covalent contributions and the resulting rise in
quantum correlations, is well captured even at this ba-
sic level of description.
Consequently, we expect that
the pronounced peak in magic proxies observed at the
bond formation region is a robust feature that will per-
sist when our approach is extended to heavier atoms and
larger, more realistic basis sets. While such extensions
may refine the quantitative details of both the binding
energy curve and the magic measures, the qualitative be-
havior and specifically, the correlation between enhanced
non-stabilizerness and the onset of covalent bonding, con-
ceptually remain. One natural obstacle to scaling up to
larger system lies in the exponential scaling of the num-
ber of Majorana string, i.e. of the fermionic phase space.
However this could be handle through the evaluation of
the magic proxies using Monte Carlo estimates [31].
The observed interplay between electronic structure
and quantum computational resources suggests that
quantum simulations of chemistry could benefit from in-
corporating magic measures as diagnostic tools. Under-
standing how magic is generated and consumed during
chemical reactions could indeed inform the design of more
efficient quantum algorithms for molecular modeling. For
instance these insights may lead to the design of more ef-
ficient quantum algorithms that adapt to the changing
resource demands along reaction coordinates.
Although magic is a computational resource concept,
there may be indirect experimental signatures—such as
changes in entanglement spectra or spectroscopic fea-
tures—that correlate with the onset of high magic. Ex-
ploring these connections could provide a new exper-
imental window into quantum correlations and non-
stabilizerness in chemical systems.
Our results indeed
hint at a broader framework where concepts from quan-
tum information theory beyond pure entanglement en-
tropy measures (like non-stabilizerness) can serve as in-
dicators of physical phenomena like bonding in molecu-
lar systems. It would be enlightening to examine how
mana scales with system size for a given chemical family,
for example does adding more electrons in similar bonds
increase the mana proportionally, or can mean-field cap-
ture most of it? Do peaks in magic proxies universally
signal the formation of covalent bonds or reaction barri-
ers? Investigating larger systems could therefore illumi-
nate whether the degree of non-stabilizerness correlates
with chemical reactivity or catalytic efficiency.
Finally,
an
intriguing
perspective
emerges
when
we
consider
harnessing
the
observed
surge
in
non-stabilizerness as a resource for quantum com-
putation. Imagine a protocol in which a dimer, initially
at its equilibrium position, is adiabatically stretched,
perhaps via coupling to an external field, to deliberately
enhance the non-stabilizerness stored in its ground
state. In this scenario, the dimer effectively serves as a
reservoir of quantum magic that could later be coupled
to an external device. Extending this idea to an array of
dimers, one could control not only the spatial orientation
and individual bond lengths but also the inter-dimer
couplings, thereby engineering a system in which both
non-stabilizerness and quantum correlations are actively
leveraged for computational tasks.
Interestingly, our
observation that the peak in non-stabilizerness shifts
slightly relative to the point of maximal extrinsic curva-
ture when using a more realistic basis set is particularly
promising.
This shift implies that the system can be
tuned to maximize magic without reaching the ‘risky’
regime where the covalent bond irreversibly breaks,
ensuring that the dimer remains intact and reusable.
Such a controlled extraction and subsequent utilization
of non-stabilizerness could open up novel avenues for
quantum simulation and computation.
