Next, we promote ˆϕ(p) as an operator, finally writing it in terms of the ladder operator. Specifi-
cally, we have,
ϕ(x, M) =
1
(2π)3
Z s
r(p, M)
2ωp

a(⃗p)e−ipx + a†(⃗p)eipx
d3⃗p ,
(17)
where the standard dispersion relation is implemented into r(p, M):
r(p, M) := r(p0 = ωp, ⃗p, M) ,
(18)
with ωp =
p
⃗p2 + m2. As it will be clear later, this is a necessary condition.
One implements the standard canonical commutation relations (CCR) but on the field ˆϕ in
(15),
[a(⃗p), a†(⃗p′)] = δ(⃗p −⃗p′)
⇔
[ˆϕ(t,⃗x), ˆπ(t, ⃗y)] = iδ(⃗x −⃗y) ,
(19)
where ˆπ = ˙ˆϕ is the conjugate variable of ˆϕ, and the square brackets denote the commutator.
One may also define,
a(⃗p, M) =
p
r(⃗p, M)a(⃗p) ,
(20)
such that CCR can be rewritten as,
[a(⃗p, M), a†(⃗p′, M)] = r(⃗p, M)δ(⃗p −⃗p′) = r(p, M)δ(⃗p −⃗p′) ,
(21)
where the last equality comes from (18). The action on the vacuum becomes
a†(⃗p, M)|0⟩=
p
r(⃗p, M)|1⃗p⟩
a(⃗p, M)|0⟩= 0 .
(22)
Therefore, the action of the field on the vacuum leads to a plane wave but with a scale-dependent
prefactor:
ϕ(x, M)|0⟩=
1

r(⃗p, M)eipx|1⃗p⟩.

The generalization of the quantization, in the presence of dimensional reduction, of vector and
fermion fields is straightforward. It is sufficient to decompose the fields as in (15) and then
write covariant CCR, for vector fields, and anti-commutation relations (ACR) for fermions.
The Reader might worry about the quantization of vector fields, then of gauge bosons, in the
presence of a dimensional scale (M) since this may resemble a cutoff, thus inconsistent with
gauge invariance. However, this is not the case. A sharp cutoff rules out the high momentum
modes breaking the gauge invariance, conversely, the Fourier transforms of the fields, e.g., (17),
ranges up to infinite energy.
