Alternatively, it can be interpreted as describing the differences in the entropy of 
folding (which is largely dictated by solvation effects), while the potential-like 
methods primarily approximate the enthalpic contribution to the folding. 
 
We thus tested whether our approach is able to generalize across different methods,  
considering the predictions of 48 methods on S461 dataset taken from Reeves and 
Kalyaanamoorthy30 and supplemented by the Pythia data. To fit the two scale values 
related to the method and to the Rose scale (see Methods equation 8) we used the 
prediction reported by the same authors on the Ssym dataset33.  
Fig. 4 reports the obtained results, grouping the methods into MBC-aware (i.e. 
trained with some mass-balance correction) and non-MBC-aware approaches (such 
as PLMs, which does not account for the mass balance). As expected, the MBC 
approach notably improved the performance of non-MBC-aware methods. 
 
 
Fig.3 Correlation among the residue coefficients of the different methods and two hydrophobicity 
scales (Kyte-Doolittle25 and Rose26). DDGun3D contains explicitly the difference of the Kyte-Doolittle 
values. ddmbc_aa_ridge is highly correlated with the Rose scale
