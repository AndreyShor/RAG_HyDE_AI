The tight-binding models
Besides the two-band models introduced above, we can also realize Brillouin platycosms in lattice models with
proper flux configuration. We present possible lattice realization for all Biebarbach groups, except the trivial P1, in
Fig. S10.
As illustrated in Fig. S10(a), (b), and (e), which correspond to k-space Pc, Cc, and P21, these models are constructed
from monoclinic lattices, each containing 8 sites in the unit cell. As shown in Fig. S10(a), π fluxes are distributed
diagonally in the x-z plane, while no fluxes are present in the other two directions. This configuration causes the
mirror symmetry Mx to anti-commute with the translation symmetry Lz. In Fig. S10(b), π fluxes are arranged in
a stripe distribution that passes through the y-z plane. Similar to Fig. S10(a), this configuration also contributes
to the anti-commutation of mirror symmetry and the translation symmetry Lz. The difference is that this lattice is
base-centered monoclinic. The lattice model of k-space P21, as shown in Fig. S10(e), exhibits stripe-distributed π
fluxes through the x-z plane. Thus, the 2-fold rotation symmetry around the z-axis anti-commutes with Lz.
Figures S10(c), (d), and (i) correspond to the k-space Pca21, Pna21, and P212121, respectively. These models
are constructed from primitive orthorhombic lattices, each containing 8 sites in the unit cell. The lattices shown in
Figs. S10(c) and (d) both exhibit real space Pmm2 symmetry. The lattice model for k-space Pca21, depicted in
Fig. S10(c), features diagonally distributed π fluxes in the x-z plane, as well as stripe-distributed π fluxes through the
x-y plane. In contrast, Fig. S10(d), corresponding to k-space Pna21, displays π fluxes arranged in a stripe distribution
that passes through both the x-z and x-y planes. Additionally, the lattice model for k-space P212121, illustrated
in Fig. S10(i), has real space P222 symmetry and exhibits stripe-distributed π fluxes through the x-z, x-y, and y-z
planes.
