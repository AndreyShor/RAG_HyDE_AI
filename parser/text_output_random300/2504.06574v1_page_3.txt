Comparison of experimental results between high- and low-level teams.
The histograms show
empirical distributions of (a) the number of passes for the high-level team, (b) the number of passes for the
low-level team, (c) the average OF area, i.e. the average area of a triangle formed by OFs, for the high-level
team, and (d) the average OF area for the low-level team. A vertical dashed line in each panel indicates the
mean value.
area and the number of passes, with the experiment. Finally, possible influence of interventions in behaviour on
ball possession performance is examined through sensitivity analysis. Our work provides researchers studying
team sports, in particular team performance in football, with a model for 3v1 ball possession game whose details
can be adjusted according to their interest. Moreover, we illustrate the potential of the modelling approach for
investigating causal effects of certain aspects of behaviour on team effectiveness in broader contexts.
Results
Empirical differences between high- and low-level teams
Fig. 1 shows the result of the 3v1 ball possession game experiments. Participants, all of whom had over 10 years
of competitive experience, were grouped into high- and low-level teams. They performed 59 (70, respectively)
ball possession games among the high-level (low-level) team members. To characterise the motion of the offensive
team, the temporal average of OF area, which was the area of the triangle formed by OFs, was recorded for
each game. The number of consecutive passes was recorded as well to measure team performance. Comparison
between Fig. 1a (high-level) and Fig. 1b (low-level) indicates the higher competence of the high-level team. That
is, the team performed better than the low-level one on average. Panels c and d (Fig. 1) indicate that the two
teams also differed with regard to their motion represented by the OF area. The high-level team maintained
a larger formation on average.
The extended formation is intuitively expected to lower the probability of
intercepts, because then DF has to run more intensely to reach the ball. Motivated by these observations, we
proceeded to construct a model capable of reproducing the characteristics of both teams.
Dynamical model for three-versus-one ball possession game
We constructed a dynamical model for 3v1 ball possession game, which is summarised in Fig. 2. A single game
consists of a sequence of pass scenes and transitions between successive passes (Fig. 2a). The model governs
the motion of five agents: the ball (B), one DF (D), and three OFs. Among OFs, one is Passer (P) making a
pass, another is Receiver (R) receiving the ball, and the other is called Mover (M), who does not touch the ball
during the pass scene. The state variables of the system, which are positions and velocities of the agents, evolve
according to the algorithm summarised in Fig. 2b.
