and a reference path, such as a straight line connecting
the initial and final states between two states, forming
a closed path again.

in M connecting fixed endpoints. The quasi-topological

D[ψ]is a functional describing the coupling between pa-
rameter variations and path variations.

Consider gauge transformations satisfying U(1) symetry

Near the endpoints, if the corrected Berry curvature is a
constant, it can be found that the variation of the geo-
metric action is zero, indicating that the boundary states
at the energy gap exhibit robustness in their geometric
response during the evolution process.

νquais a integer.When the wavefunction phases at the
endpoints are fixed (i.e., the phase difference of the wave-
function remains unchanged), the quasi-topological num-
ber exhibits gauge invariance.
Upon closing the path,
the quasi-topological number nuqua = n automatically
reduces to the Chern number. Under a gauge transfor-
mation, we obtain
|ψ(λ)⟩→eiθ(λ) |ψ(λ)⟩
(20)
and the connection is corrected as Aµ →Aµ +∂µθ,so the
system exhibits gauge invariance.In the above arguments,
we find that the geometric action introduced by AGP can
be well quantized, which is exactly what we expected.
K—thoery in the corrected topology—Any two such
paths are homotopic, as they can be continuously trans-
formed into one another without altering their topologi-
cal properties. Consequently, two non-closed paths shar-
ing the same endpoints can be assigned a common quasi-
topological number. Thus, we incorporate K-theory into
this framework. A relative K-Group

generators of a group. The geometric properties of pa-
rameter space are characterized by principal fiber bundles
P(M, G),where G is a symmetric group.Different non-
closed paths in parameter space can be classified via rela-
tive homotopy groups. Paths belonging to non-trivial ho-
motopy classes accumulate geometric phases during their
traversal. Let M be a compact manifold. Define the rel-
ative homotopy group for paths with endpoints fixed on
∂M:
