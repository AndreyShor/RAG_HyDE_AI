2.0 METHODS 
 
To determine the effect of geotechnical measurements on erosion rate and crater 
formation from PSI events, regolith simulants were exposed to subsonic, non-reacting flows of 
compressed air in a small-scale, splitter plate setup, as shown in Figure 1. This setup features a 
24.8 cm x 19.7 cm x 19.1 cm aluminum regolith bin, with a clear acrylic splitter plate on one 
side for camera observations during PSI measurements. A 600-liter, high-pressure steel cylinder 
of compressed atmospheric air, with a maximum pressure of 19,305 kPa, provided 
uninterrupted flow through a 20,684 kPa, single-staged, pressure regulator when connected to 
the experimental setup. This compressed air regulator was then connected to an inline 
Measureman digital pressure gauge (with a reported accuracy of +/- 6.9 kPa) and purge valve, 
to a 500 cm flexible high-pressure hose (with an inner diameter of 2.5 cm), before passing 
through a Parker Skinner electronic solenoid valve (with an inner diameter of 0.32 cm), a Siargo 
inline mass flow gauge (with an inner diameter of 1.3 cm and reported accuracy of 0.2 slpm), 
and finally through a 200 cm-long, aluminum pipe (with an inner diameter of 1.0 cm). The pipe 
was used as the exhaust outlet, without a converging-diverging exit nozzle or device. The exit 
nozzle was fixed at a height of 5.0 cm above each regolith sample.

Prior to measurements with regolith simulants, exhaust velocity profiles were directly 
measured using pitot-static devices as a function of exhaust height, and desired mass flow was 
accomplished by adjusting upstream chamber pressures. These velocity measurements were 
taken using a 10.0 cm pitot-static tube (with an inner diameter of 0.15 cm), connected to a 
XGMP3v3 pressure differential sensor and Arduino Uno to characterize the flow exiting the 
collimation pipe with a sample rate of 1,000 Hz. Velocity measurements were taken across 
multiple X-Y planes at various heights, as shown in Figure 2, using 3-dimensional manual 
translation stages to change pitot-static tube positions relative to the pipe exit in 0.1 cm 
increments.  
From these initial measurements, when conducting PSI experiments with regolith 
simulants, upstream chamber pressures were set between 275 â€“ 551 kPa using the purge valve 
and inline digital pressure gauge. Before each PSI measurement, the ambient atmospheric
