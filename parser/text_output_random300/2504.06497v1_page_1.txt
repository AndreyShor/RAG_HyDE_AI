Abstract
This study explores the intersection of continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC)
and classical machine learning, focusing on CVQC data encoding techniques, including Dis-
placement encoding and squeezing encoding, alongside Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial
(IQP) encoding from discrete quantum computing. We perform an extensive empirical anal-
ysis to assess the impact of these encoding methods on classical machine learning models,
such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and ensemble
methods like Random Forest and LightGBM. Our findings indicate that CVQC-based encod-
ing methods significantly enhance feature expressivity, resulting in improved classification
accuracy and F1 scores, especially in high-dimensional and complex datasets. However, these
improvements come with varying computational costs, which depend on the complexity of
the encoding and the architecture of the machine learning models. Additionally, we examine
the trade-off between quantum expressibility and classical learnability, offering valuable in-
sights into the practical feasibility of incorporating these quantum encodings into real-world
applications. This study contributes to the growing body of research on quantum-classical
hybrid learning, emphasizing the role of CVQC in advancing quantum data representation
and its integration into classical machine learning workflows.

Introduction
The rapid advancement of quantum computing has opened new frontiers in computational sci-
ence, particularly in the realm of data representation and processing. Quantum technologies
leverage fundamental principles such as superposition and entanglement, offering the potential
to surpass classical computational limits [1][2]. A key area of interest in this paradigm shift is
the encoding of classical data into quantum statesâ€”a process that directly influences the ef-
fectiveness of quantum-assisted machine learning models. While earlier studies have primarily
focused on standard quantum encoding techniques such as basis encoding, angle encoding, and
amplitude encoding [3], the exploration of more advanced quantum data representations remains
an evolving and promising avenue of research.
