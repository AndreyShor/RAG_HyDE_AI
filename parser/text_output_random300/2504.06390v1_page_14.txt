defined peak before gradually decreasing.
This bell-shaped response is characteristic of
interband optical transitions near the zero Landau level, and both the magnetic and electric
fields strongly influence the peak intensity and position.
Two key effects are observed as the magnetic field increases: (i) the peak intensity rises,
and (ii) the peak position shifts toward higher photon energies.
This trend reflects the
widening of the polaron-induced energy gap under stronger magnetic confinement, which
increases the energy required for optical transitions. These findings align with prior studies on
magneto-polarons in confined systems,32,33 where similar field-induced shifts and broadenings
were reported.
When the electric field is applied (Figure 2(b)), the absorption peaks become broader and
more intense across all substrates. This effect results from the enhanced localization of charge
carriers and the strengthening of their coupling with substrate SO phonons under combined
electric and magnetic fields. In particular, the field-enhanced interaction increases polaron
binding energy, which contributes to the greater optical transition probability observed.
The relative behavior among the substrates is also notable. Substrates such as SiO2
and SiC, which exhibit stronger effective polaronic coupling (balanced η and ℏωSO), show
the most pronounced absorption enhancement. In contrast, HfO2 demonstrates a weaker
response, likely due to its low phonon energy reducing the effectiveness of the polaron for-
mation despite its high polarization parameter.
Figure 3 displays the third-order nonlinear optical absorption coefficient as a function of
photon energy for four different polar substrates: h-BN, SiC, SiO2, and HfO2. Panel (a)
corresponds to the case without an electric field (F = 0), while panel (b) includes the effect
of an applied in-plane electric field (F = 0.3 V/nm). Both panels show results for increasing
magnetic field strengths (B = 0.05, 0.07, and 0.1 T).
Across all panels, the absorption coefficient exhibits a negative peak (typical for saturable
absorption) that becomes sharper and more intense as the magnetic field increases. This
behavior originates from the enhancement of the polaron-induced energy gap, which modifies
