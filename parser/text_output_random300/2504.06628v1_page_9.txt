where ∆r(t) = r(t) −r(t−), and the Marcus integrals are converted to Itˆo integrals using standard techniques [S1,
Theorem 4.4.28]. The remaining derivation for the entropy production decomposition formula will follow the same
way in the Letter.
Fluctuation theorem and irreversibility
We now utilize the framework of stochastic analysis to derive the fluctuation theorem. We rewrite the Langevin
equation (S.1) as the form of stochastic differential equation

with initial probability distribution r(0) ∼P0(r) and Wt is a standard Brownian motion in Rd, and N( dt, dz) is an
independent Poisson random measure. Its L´evy measure is given by ν( dz) dt (state-independent for N).
The probability density P(r, t) describe the distribution of r(t) at time t, and it satisfies the following L´evy-Fokker–
Planck equation:

where Wt and N( dt, dz) are identical to those of (S.4) in distribution, see also [S2]. It is important to see that, the
process rpf(t) only shares the same probability flow with the one of r(t) of (S.4) backward in time. When the active
noise vanishes, this process rpf(t) is indeed the time reversal process ˜r(t) := r(T −t) of r(t), however for general
active fluctuation systems, they are not the same in path space while only share the same probability flows. When
we consider the system (S.4) start at its steady state, the associated backward flow process (S.5) turns into
