Figure S9: Simulations of 𝐽-oscillators operating on coupled 15N-1H two spin system. Simula-
tions assume a scalar 𝐽coupling constant of 15 Hz, OPM rms noise of 0.1 pT and identical system
geometry to previous experiments. The SABRE-pumped population imbalances are set such that the
integral of peak in the conventional zero-field NMR measurement equals to 50 pT. The nuclear spin
relaxation are accounted using random fluctuating field model, resulting in resonance linewidths
(FWHM) of 0.2 Hz in conventional 𝐽-spectra. The external feedback gain is fixed at 𝐺ext = −3000
for all simulation. Each spectrum corresponds to a 1-minute acquisition, with Fourier transforma-
tion applied to the time-domain data from 20–60 seconds to generate the stacked spectra. The top
spectrum shows a simulation of conventional zero-field NMR spectrum of the system, for reference.
