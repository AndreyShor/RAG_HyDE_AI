narrower delay range of 60–138 ms. For positive external feedback gain (𝐺ext = 20, Fig. 2D), the
1-𝐽oscillator emerges spontaneously at delays ranging from 325 to 400 ms (400 ms being the
maximum sampled delay in our system). Meanwhile, the 2-𝐽oscillator is sustained under delays
spanning from 157 ms to 288 ms. Thus, the emergence of 1-𝐽and 2-𝐽quantum oscillators exhibit
different dependencies on the externally applied feedback delays. The fact of digital (as opposed
to analog) feedback can open up more possibilities in the future to control phase lag/advance for
different peaks separately.
This behavior arises due to the frequency-dependent phase shifts introduced by the delays. To
gain more insight, the delay (𝜏) is converted to the corresponding feedback phase lag (𝜑) at the
operating 𝐽-transition frequency 𝑓, calculated as 𝜑= 2𝜋𝑓𝜏as presented in Table 1. Combining
the results from both plots, it was found that the 1-𝐽quantum oscillator is sustained across the
range of phase lags from around 3.45 to 6.05 radians. Similarly, the 2-𝐽oscillator remains active
within a comparable phase lag interval, approximately between 3.33 and 6.10 radians. Notably,
these intervals appear symmetric around the 3𝜋/2 phase lag.
The phase dependence arises because the feedback field component that is shifted by approx.
±𝜋/2 (relative to the signal generated by the sample) contributes to amplifying the selected 𝐽-
transitions. The feedback component aligned directly in-phase (0) or opposite (𝜋) does not drive the
amplification. We characterize this contribution by defining an “effective external feedback gain,”
𝐺ext sin 𝜑(32). For sustained quantum oscillations to emerge, the absolute value of this effective
gain must exceed a specific threshold (discussed below). Moreover, the sign of the effective gain
must match the direction of the hyperpolarized population imbalances: in the current case, a
negative effective gain is required, corresponding to a population inversion between the selected
𝐽-transitions. Consequently, the dependence of quantum oscillator emergence on the externally
imposed phase lag provides a convenient method to selectively amplify individual 𝐽-transitions at
specific frequencies, demonstrating the capability for on-demand spectral editing (see Fig. 3).
