Therefore, π1(S3\Γ5) = {{lab}a̸=b|Eqn.(7)}. Already from the definition, one can immediately notice an isomorphism
Y : π1(sk1(4-simplex)) →π1(S3\Γ5) that maps Y (pab) = lab for (¯a¯b) ̸= (¯1¯3) or (¯3¯1) and Y (p13) = l(1)

each corresponding to a tetrahedron on the boundary of the 4-simplex and (8f) relates the holonomy H(1)
13 around
△13 as the boundary of tetra1 and the holonomy H(3)
13 around the same triangle as the boundary of tetra3. ρ and ρ′
effectively associate connections ωflat and ωspin respectively to the 4-simplex and S3\Γ5 respectively. We then have a
similar commuting map as (3) but in one higher dimension represented in SL(2, C).

where the quotient is by the conjugate action of SL(2, C).
Note that (8) does not define the geometry of a 4-simplex as eHab ∈SL(2, C) instead of SU(2). However, eHab ∈
SU(2) , ∀(¯a¯b) would be a too strong requirement for identifying the geometry of a 4-simplex. We will see in the next
section that a looser restriction, which will be shown to be given by the spinfoam boundary condition in Section V,
is enough for reconstructing the geometry of a 4-simplex from (8).
III.
FROM FLAT CONNECTION TO CURVED GEOMETRY
Let us now specify how imposing restrictions on the holonomies { eHab} allows us to describe the geometry of a
constantly curved 4-simplex. We require that each SL(2, C) holonomy eHab of the flat connection defined in (8) is
restricted to that conjugate to an SU(2) holonomy, denoted as Oab, and its eigenvalue gives the area aab of △ab. More
precisely, let
eHab = gaOabg−1

where ga, gb ∈SL(2, C) and Oab, Oba ∈SU(2). ga can be geometrically interpreted as parallel transporting the base
point b in S3\Γ5 to the base point ba on the 4-holed sphere Sa ⊂∂(S3\Γ5) defining {Oac}c.
Then Oab is the
holonomies on Sa based at ba around the hole as a boundary of the annulus connecting to Sb, denoted as (ab)1,
oriented in the outgoing direction of Sa. In this way, the constrained versions of closure conditions (8a)–(8e) are
O13O12O15O14 = 1 ,
(11a)
1 We remind the readers that (ab) should not be confused with (¯a¯b). The former denotes the 2-dimensional annulus connecting 4-holed
spheres Sa and Sb while the latter denotes the edge in the 4-simplex that connects vertices ¯a and ¯b.
