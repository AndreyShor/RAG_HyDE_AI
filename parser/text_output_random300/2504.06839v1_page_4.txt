The kinetic theory for the periodic Lorentz gas in the Boltzmann-Grad limit.
Going back to (1.0.4),
one may also ask whether it is possible to obtain such a kinetic equation in the periodic case. The answer is no:
using the heavy tail of the distribution of the free path length, Golse [10] proved that in any dimension d ≥2 there
exists an initial datum µin : Td × Sd−1 →[0, +∞) such that if the obstacles are balls of radius ε
1
d−1 located in Zd,
no subsequence of the densities {µ t
ε }ε (with initial datum µin) can converge to the solution of the linear Boltzmann
equation.
In [6, 7] the authors obtained an equation, rigorously derived in [14], for the time evolution of the limiting density.
We restate it in dimension d = 2, even if in [14] any dimension d ≥2 has been considered. Denoting by µin the
limiting probability density of the initial data, the equation writes as

∂s (x, v, s, h) =

µt(x, v, s, h)|t=0 = µin(x, v)E(s, h)
.
(1.1.4)
Let us comment the above expression. The key argument used by the authors to understand the time evolution of the
Boltzmann-Grad limit of a probability density on the phase space was to extend the phase space itself by adding the
couple (s, h) =(time to the next collision, impact parameter of the next collision) defined before. Indeed the random
flight (Xt, Vt)t≥0 in the Boltzmann-Grad limit obtained in [14] is not a Markov process (in (x, v)), therefore it is not
possible to find a memoryless equation for the limiting density µt(x, v). Thus, the probability measure on the new
expanded phase space R2 × S1 × [0, +∞) × [−1, 1] is to be understood as the probability of having at time t position
x and velocity v, hitting the next obstacle within time s (i.e., at time t + s) and with impact parameter h.
There are still some quantities to be commented in (1.1.4). One of them is E, that is, the invariant probability
measure for the time evolution of the density in (s, h), obtained as
Definition 1.2.
E(s, h) :=

dh′Q(s′, h|h′).
Lastly R[θ(h′)] rotates a vector v = (cos θ, sin θ) ∈S1 by angle θ(h′) = π −2 arcsin(h′), that is
R[θ(h′)]v = (cos(θ + θ(h′)), sin(θ + θ(h′))).
Let us stress, finally, that in the previous equation x can be a point in T2 or in R2. This ambiguity comes from the
obstacles’ lattice being periodic.
The time evolution equation (1.1.4) raises the problem of studying the long time behavior of the solution µt.
To begin with, let us notice that one can introduce randomness also in the new parameters (s, h), getting thus the
following equation for the time evolution of a density

∂µt
∂t (x, v, s, h) + v · ∇xµt(x, v, s, h) −∂µt
∂s (x, v, s, h) =
R 1
−1 dh′Q(s, h|h′)µt(x, R[θ(h′)]v, 0, h′)
µt(x, v, s, h)|t=0 = µ0(x, v, s, h)
.
(1.1.5)
For our purpose using θ ∈T1
2π := R/(2πZ) as a parameter is more comfortable rather than v ∈S1, therefore hereafter
we will denote
µ(x, θ, s, h) := µ(x, v(θ), s, h)
if
v(θ) = (cos θ, sin θ),
and writing µt as a function of θ instead of v, the equation (1.1.5) writes as

∂µt
∂t (x, θ, s, h) + v(θ) · ∇xµt(x, θ, s, h) −∂µt
∂s (x, θ, s, h) =
R 1
−1 dh′Q(s, h|h′)µt(x, θ + π −2 arcsin(h′), 0, h′)
µt(x, θ, s, h)|t=0 = µ0(x, θ, s, h)
.(1.1.6)
In [14] existence and uniqueness for the solutions of (1.1.6) have been proved, as well as the fact that the L1 distance
between two solutions is non increasing in time. As pointed out by the authors, a solution of (1.1.6) can be represented
by
µt(x, θ, s, h)
=
µ0(x −tv(θ), θ, s + t, h)

(1.1.7)
so that the solution turns out to be the sum of two contributions: the first one can be understood as the probability
density of the particles which collide for the first time at time t, while the second one represents the probability density
of the particles which have collided at least one time before time t. Moreover, if we evaluate the equation (1.1.7) at
s = 0 we get
µt(x, θ, 0, h) = µ0(x −tv(θ), θ, t, h)
