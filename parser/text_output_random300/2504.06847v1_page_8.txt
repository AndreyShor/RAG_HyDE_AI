on a prism with incidence face (h0l). For the measurement of refractive indices of 2-
AmpH2PO3, besides a single crystal prism with incidence face (010), a second prism with 
incidence face (001) was prepared and used. Refractive index data were collected at 9 discrete 
wavelengths between 435.8 nm and 1083.0 nm. The measured data nmeas. were corrected with 
respect to the refractive index of air according to ncorr. = nmeas.·nair using data for standard air 
from [44]. All data in the following are corrected refractive index data. A modified Sellmeier 
equation was fitted to the refractive index data, which characterizes the wavelength dispersion 
of the refractive indices of 2-AmpH2PO3:

From the mixed index n' the orientation angle  was calculated according to   =  +  - 90°

The orientation angle  was also checked and verified by direct observation of the extinction 
angle of a (010) crystal plate with respect to the a axis with a polarization microscope between 
crossed polarizers. 
  
2.6. SHG measurements 
Initial SHG measurements on polar 2-AmpH2PO3 were performed by the modified Kurtz-
Perry powder method [45] using 800 nm pulses of Ti: sapphire laser (MaiTai, Spectra-Physics). 
The first experiments were performed on powdered samples (100-150 m particle size). The 
phase matching measurements were then carried out on the size fractioned samples (particle
