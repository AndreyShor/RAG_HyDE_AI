Figures 3(c) and (d) show the Si-based spectra under TM and TE polarizations. Unlike the Ti 
cases, the spectra here contain dense, sharp resonances that shift in wavelength as the refractive 
index varies. These features reflect Mie-type behavior typical of high-index dielectric 
nanostructures. The field analysis representing the physical phenomena underlying such 
resonances is thoroughly discussed in our prior work27. Because the peak shifts are narrow and 
localized, the intensity at most fixed wavelengths remains relatively constant unless a resonance 
aligns with that location. This creates a more complex spectral behavior that is less compatible 
with simple linear modeling. By contrast, the Ti spectra display smoother and more predictable 
global changes in intensity, which are better suited for linear regression. These observations 
establish the foundation for comparing full-spectrum machine learning performance across 
different structural and spectral regimes. 
Figure 4 provides magnified views of the selected spectral regions from the Ti-based meta-
grating, focusing on wavelengths with high variations of intensity across refractive indices. Figures 
4(aâ€“d) show the spectral response at four different wavelengths, chosen based on visually 
identifiable intensity changes across refractive indices. These wavelengths were selected because 
they appear to vary in a monotonic and relatively consistent manner, which aligns with the 
assumptions of linear modeling. Figures 4(a) and (c) show TM polarization results, while Figures 
4(b) and (d) correspond to TE polarization. Each of these points is used to assess how well a single-
wavelength intensity value can serve as a predictor for refractive index using conventional 
regression. 
Figures 4(e) and (f) present the same Ti-based spectra, zoomed in around the single spectral 
peak in TM and TE polarizations, respectively. These plots demonstrate that, unlike the Si-based 
structures, the single peak position does not shift noticeably with changes in refractive index. The 
spectral shape remains fixed, and the only observable variation is in the amplitude of absorption. 
This highlights a key distinction in the sensing behavior of the Ti structure. While the intensity-
based features allow for straightforward linear modeling, there is no resonant wavelength tracking 
involved. These observations confirm that intensity modulation is the dominant mechanism for 
index detection in Ti-based configurations.
