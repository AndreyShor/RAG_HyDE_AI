By inspecting Eq. (2.7) we ﬁnd the usual BRST breaking (cf. [20, 21, 23]) in D-
dimension located in the evanescent kinetic term of the right-handed fermions,

Determining the ﬁnite two-loop counterterms and non-
Abelian obstacles
This section serves as a brief discussion of our approach to determining the spurious
symmetry breaking and restoring the symmetry via counterterms. For a thorough account
see Ref. [17]. The main focus will be to highlight diﬀerences stemming from non-Abelian
interactions. The structure constants are no longer zero, which e.g. makes for interaction
terms between ghosts and gauge bosons. Although this has been the case for related works
in non-Abelian models at one-loop as well, some of these complications appear ﬁrst at the
two-loop level, while others are technical issues due to the necessity of implementing the
external source operators in computer calculations. We shall begin with a brief exposition
of Slavnov-Taylor identities and the quantum action principle which are our means of
quantifying and computing the symmetry breaking while also allowing us to shed light
on some non-Abelian aspects. In the second part we explain how we implemented both
the breaking ∆-vertices and external ﬁelds in FeynArts.

Slavnov-Taylor identities and the quantum action principle in DReg
The appropriate tool for studying BRST symmetry in the renormalized theory is the
Slavnov-Taylor identity, which expresses BRST invariance on the level of 1PI Green func-
tions. The ultimate Slavnov-Taylor identity required to hold after renormalization is
LIM
D→4 SD(ΓDRen) = 0,
(3.1)
where the limit includes setting evanescent objects to zero.
Here the Slavnov-Taylor
operator is deﬁned as
S(ΓDRen) =

(3.2)
where we follow the notation of Ref. [17] for the 1PI quantum eﬀective action Γ, and
where φ and Kφ denote the quantum ﬁelds and the sources introduced in Eq. (2.13),
respectively. We further introduce a linearized Slavnov-Taylor operator,
