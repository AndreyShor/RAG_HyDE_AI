Johanna Müller-Horn et al.: HIP 15429: a newborn Be star on an eccentric binary orbit
To match the spectroscopic mass more closely, models with an
initial donor mass around ∼4 M⊙would be required. However,
such models would under-predict the observed luminosity.
Assuming this initial mass for the stripped star, we have var-
ied initial masses and mass transfer efficiencies for the accreting
companion star. Overall we find a good match between the es-
timated parameters of the binary stars in HIP 15429 and those
of the MESA simulated binary during the bloated stripped star
phase. When the simulated stripped star (again model M3, see
Fig. 13) reaches an effective temperature of ≈13.5 kK, it has
log g = 2.47, radius R = 9.5 R⊙and L = 2750 L⊙, all consis-
tent within the uncertainties with the observed values. At this
point the now more massive companion star has a tempera-
ture of ≈17.9 kK, it has log g = 3.9, radius R = 4.4 R⊙and
L = 1790 L⊙. The mass ratio q = 0.16 and the period P = 247 d
are comparable to observational estimates as well.
Without having conducted an extensive parameter search, we
cannot put tight constrains on the properties of the progenitor
system, and there may well be other regions of parameter space
that can reproduce observed parameter values. However, the fact
that we can construct a model in good agreement with observa-
tions also with a small grid speaks to the feasibility and plausi-
bility of the evolutionary scenario.
9. Discussion on orbital eccentricity
Fig. 15 places the orbital eccentricity of HIP 15429 in the context
of physically related systems. We find it to be empirically excep-
tional, warranting a detailed discussion. There are a number of
conceivable mechanisms to explain the high eccentricity, which
we discuss in turn without identifying an obvious favourite.
We compare HIP 15429 to other bloated stripped stars with
constrained periods and eccentricities and O/Be companions
(red diamond markers), namely LB-1 (Shenar et al. 2020) and
HR 6819 (El-Badry & Quataert 2021) in the lower mass regime
and VFTS 291 (Villaseñor et al. 2023), 2dFS 2553, Sk -71◦35
(Ramachandran et al. 2024) and AzV 476 (Pauli et al. 2022) in
the intermediate mass range. HIP 15429 stands out as the bloated
stripped star with the longest period and by a factor of more
than two the highest eccentricity. The as yet only other identified
bloated stripped star binary with substantial eccentricity is AzV
476 (e = 0.24 ± 0.002; Pauli et al. 2022).
As a likely progenitor of a subdwarf + Be binary system it-
self, we also compare HIP 15429 to other such binaries that have
constrained orbital solutions (Mourard et al. 2015; Chojnowski
et al. 2018; Peters et al. 2008, 2013; Klement et al. 2022, 2024;
Wang et al. 2023). For most of these systems, the orbits are con-
sistent with being circular (see the light blue triangles in Fig. 15).
The two notable exceptions are the binaries 59 Cyg and 60 Cyg
with eccentricities of 0.141 ± 0.008 and 0.2 ± 0.01, respectively
(Peters et al. 2013; Klement et al. 2024). For 59 Cyg an outer
third component has been detected that may have tidally affected
the inner Be + subdwarf binary. For 60 Cyg the origin of the non-
zero eccentricity remains unknown (Klement et al. 2024).
Fig. 15 further shows a selection of subdwarf binaries with
lower-mass main sequence or white dwarf companions. The or-
bital period distribution of this population is bi-modal, with a
short-period subset (≲10 d) compiled by Edelmann et al. (2005)
and Kupfer et al. (2015), and a group of long-period (≳500 d)
subdwarf binaries (Deca et al. 2012; Barlow et al. 2013; Vos
et al. 2013, 2017). The short-period binaries are thought to result
from common envelope evolution, leading to near-circular orbits
(Paczynski 1976), while the long-period systems likely formed
via stable mass transfer, with low but non-zero eccentricity. For
subdwarfs formed via stable Roche-lobe overflow, final orbital
periods depend on the onset of mass transfer and the mecha-
nisms of angular momentum loss, producing a wide range of
predicted periods (Han et al. 2002, 2003). The intermediate pe-
riod of HIP 15429 is therefore not unexpected, but its unusually
high eccentricity (the highest by more than a factor of two) is.
We describe several mechanisms that have been proposed to
explain eccentric orbits in post-interaction binary systems and
discuss their applicability to HIP 15429.
9.1. Phase-dependent Roche-lobe overflow
One possible mechanism to excite eccentricity in mass-
transferring binaries is phase-dependent mass loss during Roche-
lobe overflow. If the binary is in a somewhat eccentric orbit to
begin with, a varying mass loss rate that is greater during the
periastron than the apastron can increase the orbital eccentricity
(Vos et al. 2015). The strength of eccentricity pumping will de-
pend on the mass loss rate and the fraction of mass accreted by
the companion. The mechanism has been invoked, for example,
by Bonaˇci´c Marinovi´c et al. (2008) to explain the observed ec-
centricity of post-AGB binaries. Simulations of Vos et al. (2015)
show the potential to increase eccentricities to e ≈0.15 at peri-
ods of close to a thousand days. However, it is unclear whether
the mechanism is sufficient to excite eccentricities as high as
that of HIP 15429 at shorter orbital periods. Furthermore, there
would need to be a specific reason why HIP 15429 is more ec-
centric than other similar systems.
9.2. Circumbinary disk evolution
An alternative mechanism for eccentricity pumping is the tem-
porary formation of a circumbinary disk (CBD) during the mass
transfer phase. Interactions between binary and CBD, including
gas and momentum exchange and gravitational torques, can sig-
nificantly alter the binary orbital parameters (e.g., Goldreich &
Tremaine 1980).
CBDs have been observed around post-AGB binaries with
periods of hundreds to thousands of days (Kluska et al. 2022).
Many post-AGB binaries exhibit substantial eccentricities de-
spite the expected orbital circularization during the AGB phase
(Van Winckel 2018; Oomen et al. 2018), potentially arising from
gravitational interactions with a CBD (Dermine et al. 2013).
The outcome of disk-binary interactions depends on the bi-
nary parameters, in particular the mass ratio and eccentricity
(e.g., Goldreich & Tremaine 1980; Artymowicz et al. 1991). Hy-
drodynamical simulations indicate that disk-binary interactions
drive the system toward an equilibrium eccentricity, determined
by a balance between Lindblad and co-rotation resonances (Valli
et al. 2024). For binaries with mass ratios near unity, the equi-
librium eccentricity is predicted to be roughly 0.5 but it may be
lower for systems with unequal mass ratios (Siwek et al. 2023).
The timescale to reach the equilibrium state is estimated to be on
the order of a few Myr.
For HIP 15429, a CBD may have formed temporarily from
the mass lost through the donor’s L2 Lagrange point (or possibly
also the accretor star in case of high mass transfer rates; Lu et al.
2023). Dynamical interactions could have excited the orbital ec-
centricity, although the observed value of 0.52 exceeds the pre-
dicted equilibrium eccentricity for the low mass ratio of the sys-
tem (q ≲0.1), which is closer to 0.2 (Siwek et al. 2023). Further-
more, the short duration of the mass transfer phase (≲0.4 Myr)
may have been insufficient to significantly increase eccentricity.
