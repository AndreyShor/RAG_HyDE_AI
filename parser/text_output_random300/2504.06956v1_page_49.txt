Figure 2: A diagram illustrating the decomposition of the cube [0, 1]d used in the proof of Lemma 6.3, in
the case d = 2. For R ≥1, we suppose that along each edge of the d edges of [0, 1]d, there are exactly
(es + 1)(R + 1)−1 smaller closed boxes, which are drawn in white and that we enumerate by (Ai)i∈[I], for
some I ∈N. For each i ∈[I], the box Ai has side length equal to Re−s. The shaded region is the buffer
zone BR,s = [0, 1]d \ ∪i∈[I]Ai. By construction, the buffer zone separates the smaller cubes by a distance
of at least e−s.
where (Ai)i∈[I] and BR,s are as described in the caption of Figure 2.
The reason why the decomposition (6.3) turns out to be useful is due to the short-range correlation
properties of the fields Xt and Wt. Indeed, since we are assuming that the seed covariance function K
satisfies condition (K2), as we have observed in Section 3.3, for 0 ≤s < t, it holds that Xs,t(x) and
Xs,t(y) are independent for |x −y| > e−s. Similarly, thanks to (W3), for 0 ≤s < t, we have that
(Wi,t(x))i∈[n] and (Wi,t(y))i∈[n] are independent for |x −y| > e−s.
As mentioned earlier, the idea is to split the field X into two scales. Roughly speaking, we first focus
on the small scales conditioned on the large scales. More precisely, we consider the sequence of
measures (µγ,s,t)0≤s<t on Rd, defined as follows,

The role of the large scales is played by a deterministic5 function χ : Rd →R. Given a function χ,
we define the measure ρχ by letting

We now have all the necessary ingredients to state the following key proposition, which is a
generalisation of [MRV16, Proposition 3.2]. The key difference is that we allow Fγ,t to take the
general form given in (6.1), rather than restricting it to be a constant. More importantly, we explicitly
identify the multiplicative constant C(γ) that appears in the statement of [MRV16, Proposition 3.2].
The proof of this proposition is postponed to Section 7.
Proposition 6.1. Fix ε > 0, let Fγ and Tγ be as in (6.1), and consider the constant ea⋆> 0 introduced
in Proposition 2.17. Then, for all s > 0 large enough and for all t ≥s large enough, the following
5At this level, we are assuming that we are conditioning on the large scales. That is why, we are thinking of the large scales
as being described by a deterministic function.
