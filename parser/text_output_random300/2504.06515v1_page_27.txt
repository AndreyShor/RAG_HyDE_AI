if |q| is ﬁxed, then a similar transition takes place at a threshold value of H0 = Hc; for the
particular choice given here, Hc/m0 = 7.21249.
Figure 10. A comparison of sub-critical repulsive motion from two perspectives. Left: Plots for various
values of |q|/m0 for H0 = 3m0—the threshold value for escape is |q|/m0 = 0.2700907567. Right: Plots
for various values of H0/m0 for |q|/m0 = 0.1—the threshold value for escape is H0/m0 = 7.21249.
The existence of two types of motion for ﬁxed H and q has no non-relativistic analogue,
and is a qualitatively new aspect of relativistic gravitation. An illustration is provided in
Figure 11, showing r(τ) for H0 = 3m0 and |q|/m0 = 0.25 < qc/m0. Both bounded motion
and a sequence of possible unbounded motions can exist. The tanh-type A and B motions
have the speciﬁc feature that r(τ) diverges (the particles attain inﬁnite separation) at ﬁnite
proper time (but at inﬁnite coordinate time).
Figure 11. An illustration of the possible bounded motion (solid) and unbounded motions (dotted
and dashed) for the same values of H0 = 3m0 and |q|/m0 = 0.25 < qc/m0 depicted in position space
(left) and phase space (right). The initial value r(0) determined which of these motions is realized. The
flat-space (κ = 0 ) electrodynamic phase space trajectory is shown in the right panel for comparison.
The repulsive case: e1 = e2 = q, |q| > qc
Only unbounded motion is permitted in this case since the electromagnetic repulsive
force overwhelms the attractive gravitational force if |q| > qc. The r(τ) trajectories are
qualitatively similar to the unbounded motions depicted in Figure 11; to understand the
distinctions between unbounded motion for this case and that for the |q| ≤qc case, it is
instructive to consider the phase space plots.
First, consider the physical region of the (|q|, p) parameter space, as shown in Figure 12
for H0 = 3m0. From (106), the shaded area is the region J 2 > 0 and B > 0, where the
tanh-type A and tanh-type B give the actual trajectories. The boundary of this area is
ﬁxed by p = −√
2/κ |q| + H0/2 and p = ±p0 = ±
p
(H0/2)2 −m2 (= ±
√
5m0/2 for the
speciﬁc choice in Figure 12). The values of |q| at the intersections of these boundary lines
are qd (for the negative solution) and qc (the critical value (136)) for the positive one. The
tanh-type B solution is realized in a very narrow region between the dashed (J −B = 0)
and solid (p = −√
2/κ |q| + H0/2) curves in the shaded region. The tan-type A and B
trajectories are realized in the unshaded J 2 < 0 region.
The dotted line in Figure 12 denotes a constant |q|/m0 line whose intercepts with
the diagonal lines p = ±√
2/κ |q| + H0/2 are p1/m0 and p2/m0. In the subcritical region
