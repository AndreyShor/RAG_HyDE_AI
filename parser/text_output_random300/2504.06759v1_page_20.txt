Distance dependence of hopping parameter. Vppσ used in the sliding
calculations as a function of distance between atoms, taken to be zero beyond
√
c2 + a2. The abrupt
changes visible in Fig. 3b of the main paper are due to of this sharp cut-off, and would not occur with a
more smoothly decaying hopping. Here γ3 and γ4 are values of the interlayer coupling between atoms of
differing and like sublattice in the bulk respectively. Their numerical values are taken from literature2–5.
