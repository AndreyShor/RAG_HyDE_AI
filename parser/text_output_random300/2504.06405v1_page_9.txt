and similarity to our previous work on mechanically mediated polymerization responded to 
electrical inputs of frequency, voltage, and exposure time. Using this method, we demonstrated 
the creation of electric-field-adaptive multi-stiffness gel and electro-adhesive. We foresee 
applications for adaptive damping and variable-rigidity materials, adhesives, soft robotics, and 
potentially tissue engineering. 
 
Methods 
Material 
Tri(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether (TEGDE), 2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)diethanethiol (EDT), 1,3,5-
triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione (TTT), 5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)pentanamide (DPA), 
methyl methacrylate (MMA), tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Et4NBF4), potassium iodide 
(KI), 4-p-methoxyphenol  (MEHQ), zinc tetrafluoroborate hydrate, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 
99%), indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass slide (70-00 Ω/sq, rectangular) were obtained from 
Sigma-Aldrich. Chloroform-d (CDCl3, 99.8 %) and 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (99.96 %) 
TraceCERT® standards for quantitative NMR were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals 
were used as received. Dry DMF was obtained after purification using an in-house solvent 
purification system. ZnO (18 nm, 99.95%), BaTiO3 (200 nm, 99.9%, tetragonal), ZnO-silane 
coated (18 nm, 99.95%), and TiO2 (100 nm, rutile 99.9+%) were purchased from US Research 
Nanomaterials Inc. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT, 100-150 nm, 99.9%) and Bismuth Ferrite 
(BiFeO3, 80-100 nm, 99.9%) were purchased from Nanoshel LLC. Polypropylene cuboid vials 
(1.70 cm × 1.35 cm × 3.78 cm) were purchased from United States Plastic Corp. Platinum foils 
(0.1mm thick, 99.99%) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Gorilla super glue 
cyanoacrylate gel was purchased from Amazon.com, Inc. and Hardman double/bubble epoxy glue 
was obtained from Ellsworth Adhesive. 
 
Measurements 
1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE II+ (500 
MHz) spectrometer at 25 °C and processed them in MestReNova 14.2.0.  
 
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was conducted in a Shimadzu Prominence LC instrument 
equipped with Shimadzu Prominence LC-one Agilent PLgel 5 μm MiniMix-D separation column, 
eluent: stabilized THF (BHT 250 ppm), flow rate: 1 ml min-1, temperature T = 25 °C, a Shimadzu 
UV-VIS detector, a Wyatt DAWN HELEOS II multi-angle light scattering detector (658 nm laser), 
a Wyatt ViscoStar III detector and a Wyatt OptiLab T-rEX RI detector. The GPC system was 
calibrated with polystyrene (PS) standards.   
 
Zeta potential measurement was conducted via a Mobius Zeta Potential Analyzer at the sample 
concentration of 0.2 mg ml–1 in DMF under DC voltage from 5 to 50 V. 
 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NEXSA G2 Keck-II XPS with monochromatic Al Kα X-ray 
radiation, emission current of 15 mA and hybrid lens mode, Manchester, UK) was used for the 
analysis of the surface of nanoparticles. Wide and narrow spectra were measured with pass energy 
of 80 eV and 20 eV, respectively. XPS spectra were analyzed using Avantage software version 
6.6.0 Beta. All spectra were calibrated using C 1s peaks with a fixed value of 284.8 eV.
