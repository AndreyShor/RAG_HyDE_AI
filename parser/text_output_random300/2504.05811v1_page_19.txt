Polarization observables
Fig. 7 to Fig. 15 display the polarization observables for γp →K+Σ0 and γp →K0Σ+ obtained
in our theoretical calculations corresponding to the parameters listed in Table II and Table III.
Almost all of the available experimental data shown in these figures can be well described, which
is truly encouraging and demonstrates the effectiveness of our theoretical model. We also present
predictions for some regions currently lacking experimental data, which can be compared with
future experimental results. There are two points that need further explanation below.
First, as mentioned in Sec. IV A, the χ2/Ndata of Σ for γp →K+Σ0 is relatively high, primarily
due to the rather small error bars associated with the data points. In Fig. 8, we can see that our
theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental data in most regions. However, due
to the quite small error bars in the experimental data from CLAS 2016 [32], even slight deviations
can lead to a significant increase in the value of χ2. So we do not adjust the weight of it to improve
its χ2.
Second, the amount of experimental data for the polarization observables is still relatively lim-
ited, particularly for the reaction γp →K0Σ+, and the precision of some available experimental
data is also insufficient. These result in the experimental data still not being adequately con-
straining for our model parameters. We just provide a potential theoretical result based on the
currently available experimental data for the reactions γp →K+Σ0 and γp →K0Σ+. However,
more abundant and high-precision experimental data, particularly for the reaction γp →K0Σ+,
are necessary to further strengthen the constraints on the theoretical models.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Our previous studies revealed evidence of the strange molecular partners of Pc states, N(2080)3/2−
and N(2270)3/2−, in the γp →K∗+Σ0/K∗0Σ+ and γp →ϕp reactions [16, 17]. Inspired by the
experimental data of differential cross-sections for γp →K+Σ0 from CLAS 2010 [24], which reveal
some bump structures around W = 1875, 2080 and 2270 MeV—corresponding to the Breit-Wigner
masses of N(1875)3/2−, N(2080)1/2−& 3/2−, N(2270)1/2−, 3/2−& 5/2−—we decided to extend
our previous work by investigating the effects of these six molecules, along with N(1535)1/2−,
as strange partners of Pc molecular states in the reactions γp →K+Σ0 and γp →K0Σ+. Our
theoretical model is based on an effective Lagrangian approach in the tree-level Born approxima-
tion [40, 41], and contains the contributions from s-channel with exchanges of N, ∆, N∗(including
