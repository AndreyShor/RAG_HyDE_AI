THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS
The three DR reactions studied in the present work
are:
(i) for Y II to Y I, (for l â‰¤9 and n = 6, . . . , 35)
Y+[5s2(i)] + eâˆ’â†’

Yâˆ—[5s 5p nlj(d)]
Yâˆ—[5s 4d nlj(d)]

(ii) for Sr II to Sr I, (for l â‰¤9 and n = 6, . . . , 35)

Te2+[5s2 5p2(i)] + eâˆ’â†’

Te+âˆ—[5s2 5p 5d nlj(d)]

Here, i denotes the ground state, d represent the inter-
mediate states, and f indexes the final states. The Ryd-
berg electron is represented as nlj, where n is the prin-
cipal quantum number of the captured electron. Here,
n is determined based on convergence. Including more
n-values (e.g., in the hundreds) would have some minor
effect on the results, but the difference should not be very
significant compared to the values used in the present
case. This contributes to some uncertainty in the cal-
culation, which has been accounted for when addressing
the overall uncertainty. The emitted decay photons are
denoted by hÎ½. For a given n, angular momentum states
l = 0, 1, . . . , 9 and j = |l Â± 1
2| are included. Radiative de-
cay involves all electric dipole transitions to lower-lying
states resulting in a significant number of states to con-
sider. Except for the 4d state of Sr+ and 4f state of Ce2+,
all transitions occur within the same shell (âˆ†n = 0),
while the 5s â†’4d transition in Sr+ and 4f â†’5d transi-
tion in Ce2+ involves inter-shell excitation (âˆ†n = 1).
For a dielectronic recombination channel, i.e. for a two-
step transition i â†’d â†’f, the cross section is expressed
as a function of the electron kinetic energy E in the inde-
pendent resonances approximation as (see, e.g. [32, 38â€“
41])

The initial state of the DR process which consists of
the ground-state ion and a continuum electron with an
asymptotic momentum âƒ—p and spin projection ms. In ad-
dition, Î“d is the total natural width of the intermediate
autoionizing state, which is the sum of the radiative and
autoionization widths: Î“d = Ad

units with Â¯h = 1). Ld(E) is the Lorentzian line shape

(E/c)2 âˆ’c2 is the modulus of the free-electron
momentum associated with the kinetic energy E.
The dielectronic capture rate is related to the rate of
its time-reversed process, i.e., the Auger process, by the
principle of detailed balance:

Here, Jd and Ji are the total angular momenta of the
intermediate and the initial states of the recombination
process, respectively. Neglecting the energy-dependence
of the electron momentum in the vicinity of the reso-
nance, the dielectronic resonance strength, defined as the
integrated cross section for a given resonance peak,

channels and averaging over the Maxwellian distribution
of electron energies [42]. In this expression, k denotes
the Boltzmann constant, h is the Planck constant that
we write explicitly here, T represents the electron tem-
perature, and E is the resonance energy.
