Appendix A: Position Initialization
Here, we describe the generation of initial configurations. As the tweezer positions are given in the 2D plane, a
configuration X for m qubits is given by X = [x1, . . . xm] ∈Rm×2. The qubits are placed randomly within a box
[−Rmax, Rmax]2, where the qubit positions get resampled whenever the euclidean distance between any two qubits
is below Rmin > 0.
The first atom can thus be placed anywhere in [−Rmax, Rmax]2 and each subsequent atom
will be repeatedly placed at random in [−Rmax, Rmax]2 until it is at least distance Rmin from the already placed atoms.
As mentioned in Sec. III, configurations tend to contract under the consensus algorithm. This leads to lower in-
teratomic distances and thus facilitates more entanglement.
Therefore, it is not entirely fair to compare initial
configurations to the final ones. By only varying the target Hamiltonian Htarg, we get a large collection of similar
problems. We can find the kernel density estimate of interatomic distances to get the gold curve in Fig. 6. We can then
optimize for a new Rmin and Rmax to get a distribution of interatomic distances (Fig. 6 green) that most resembles
that of the final configurations (Fig. 6 gold). This is done by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence [41] between
the two distributions.
Appendix B: Rydberg neutral atoms
This section introduces basic Rydberg physics to identify what control pulses and especially interactions can look like
for this system, as discussed in Sec. III. This will yield both the control Hamiltonian Hc[z] depending on the pulses,
and the interaction Hamiltonian HV [X] depending on the configuration, see (1). We consider a neutral atom quantum
computing platform consisting of individual neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezers, where the electronic states
encode for the qubit manifold [42]. Generally, three states are considered for neutral atom systems, a well-isolated
manifold consisting of the ground state |g0⟩and a meta-stable state |g1⟩, as well as an auxiliary Rydberg state |r⟩
used for interaction.
Single qubit rotations on qubit j between states |a⟩and |b⟩are facilitated by a laser interacting with the atom to
realize the Hamiltonian [28, 42]

On atom j, Ωab,j(t) denotes the coupling strength, φab,j(t) the phase of the coupled laser, and ∆b,j(t) = ωab,j(t)−˜ωab
the detuning of the laser frequency ωab,j(t) from the energy level difference ˜ωab. In current Rydberg systems, one has
less control over φ than over Ωand ∆, [43], and subsequently we set φ = 0. For our systems, we assume transitions
|g0⟩↔|g1⟩and |g1⟩↔|r⟩. This renders control pulses z(t) ∈{Ωg0g1,j(t), ∆g1,j(t), Ωg1gr,j(t), ∆gr,j}. Notice that having
both coupling and detuning allows full control on the Bloch sphere of each individual qubit, allowing rotational control
[44]. For all pulse optimizations in this work, we consider full control over all coupling strengths Ωj and detunings
∆j available in this system.
The Rydberg states |r⟩are highly excited states that have a passive ‘always-on’ interaction, which is described by
a configuration-dependent Hamiltonian HV [X] [28] as a Van der Waals interaction (VdW) [45] or a Dipole-Dipole
(Dip.) interaction (where g1 needs to be chosen as another Rydberg state), depending on the specific Rydberg states
chosen [42]

where ∥xi −xj∥is the interatomic distance between atoms i and j and C3,6 is an interaction coefficient. The VdW
interaction |rr⟩ij⟨rr|ij shifts the energy level of the doubly excited state scaling with ∥xi −xj∥6. For close enough
atoms, this shift becomes high enough that the doubly excited state becomes unadressable, resulting in a so-called
Rydberg-blockade [46].
For gg-qubits (ground-ground) we make the identification |0⟩= |g0⟩, |1⟩= |g1⟩, and the Rydberg state is used as
an auxiliary state interacting via VdW interactions. The state space now becomes that of a qutrit with dimension
