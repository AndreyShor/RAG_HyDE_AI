nature of spacetime, with classical smoothness emerging only as a low-energy approximation.
We have shown how to quantize fields in a spacetime with multifractal properties and how
this automatically implies dimensional reduction, ensuring consistency with established field
theory constraints. Notably, not only is quantization compatible with a varying dimension, but
such variation significantly enhances QFT’s robustness, enabling rigorous S-matrix construc-
tion in the interaction picture (perturbation theory). This results in a finite theory without loop
divergences and improves the perturbative series’ behavior. The significance of our contribu-
tion lies in demonstrating that non-differentiable spacetime structures are not only compati-
ble with quantum field theory but actively improve its mathematical foundation. All this is
achieved while retaining all known behaviors and predictions of standard QFT at low energies,
yet predicting new behaviors at large energies, mainly through “asymptotic safety” and small
anisotropies at high energy scatterings.
When comparing our work with existing literature, some apparent similarities arise be-
tween our quantization in section 3 and the works in [39, 40], where the author proposes
scale-dependent QFT. However, the concept of scale dependence in those works has no con-
nection to our fractality and dimensional reduction. The conceptual framework, technical de-
tails, and outcomes are fundamentally different. Some analogy in intent exists with our earlier
proposal [41]. However, important differences exist concerning what we proposed in this work.
The approach in [41] requires modifications due to defining the action via Stieltjes integrals, en-
tailing modifications to the equations of motion that must be addressed with certain constraints.
The Stieltjes-integral action approach in [41] is more technically involved and becomes incon-
sistent when introducing Lagrangians with additional fields, particularly fermions. Conversely,
our present approach requires only a specific quantization of the standard action, incorporating
a dimensional reduction scale, and it remains unaltered with the addition of new fields, fermions
included. A radically different route to model fractal spaces is the one in [42], based on frac-
tional calculus. A final parallel can be drawn with [43, 44]; however, these references attempt
to address varying topological dimensions, rendering the framework genuinely distinct.
Looking beyond particle physics, we should also comment on the possible impact of (30)
on the standard cosmological model. First, the vacuum energy density becomes finite, like any
integral in the theory, but remains remarkably large – approximately O(M 4). Standard QFT
requires regularization and renormalization to control divergences; conversely, in fractal space-
time QFT, integrals are inherently finite, though the renormalization group equation remains
applicable. This property is generally independent of divergences. Thus, even in a universe with
running dimensions, QFT does not produce a small cosmological constant. The smallness must
instead be understood within the renormalization group framework, where parameter values are
in principle arbitrary and cannot be predicted.
