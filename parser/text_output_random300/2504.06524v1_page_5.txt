which shows excellent agreement with the numerical re-

systems indeed originates from the energy gap of the
ABSs.

Finally, we describe
anomalous charge transport induced by the N1D-fold de-
generate ZESs. We consider a junction consisting of three
segments: a ballistic NM segment for −∞≤j < 1, a
dirty NM segment for 1 ≤j ≤LD/a, and a SC segment
for LD/a < j ≤∞. For numerical calculations, the BdG
Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) is reformulated in a real-space

ζ,η and rhe
ζ,η denote a normal and an Andreev re-
ﬂection coeﬃcient at energy E, respectively. The indices
ζ and η correspond to the outgoing and incoming chan-
nels.
These reﬂection coeﬃcients are calculated using
recursive Green’s function techniques [76, 77]. For nu-
merical calculations, the parameters are ﬁxed as µ = t,
∆= 0.2t, vimp = 0.5t, and W = 30a. The conductance
is averaged over 5 × 103 samples with diﬀerent random
potential conﬁgurations.
In Fig. 5(a), we plot the diﬀerential conductance at
zero bias as a function of the length of the dirty NM seg-
ment. The colored (white) dots correspond to λ = 0.5t
(λ = 0). In the absence of SOC, the zero-bias conduc-
tance decreases monotonically with increasing LD.
In
contrast, for λ = 0.5t, the zero-bias conductance remains
perfectly quantized, independent of LD:
G(0) = 2e2
