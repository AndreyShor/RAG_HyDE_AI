the aligned sample in Fig. 4a,b (pointed by blue arrow) when cutting parallel to the Γ-K direction,
while absent in the non-aligned sample (Fig. 4c,d). More importantly, the flat band intensity is
strongly enhanced in the aligned sample (indicated by red arrow in Fig. 4a,b) as compared to the
non-aligned sample (Fig. 4c,d), which is supported by the intensity curve shown in Fig. 4e (see
more comparison in Extended Data Fig. 8). The stronger flat band is also clearly revealed when
comparing dispersion images measured by cutting perpendicular to the Γ-K direction (pointed by
red arrows in Fig. 4f-h and Fig. 4i-k). In particular, in the EDC stacks in Fig. 4l, the flat band in the
aligned sample shows a much stronger intensity near EF (highlighted by red dots and shadings),
while in the non-aligned sample, weaker peaks are only barely detectable near EF (Fig. 4m). The
enhancement of the flat band intensity clearly demonstrates that the moir´e potential does play an
important role in modifying the flat band electronic structure of aligned R5G/BN, even though the
moir´e interface on the backside is far away from the top surface exposed in NanoARPES measure-
ments.
The observation of clear moir´e bands and stronger flat band in aligned R5G/BN suggests
that electrons located on the top surface (moir´e-distant surface) experience a spatially modulated
potential, whose periodicity follows that of the moir´e superlattice. We note that in various theoret-
ical calculations6,7,12,13,16,17, a moir´e potential of no more than 30 meV is often applied only to the
moir´e-proximal surface, and its main effect is to gap or isolate the topological flat band from other
bands (Extended Data Fig. 9). Although such gap opening is beyond the state-of-art NanoARPES
experimental resolution, the mini-gap opening could be part of the reason for the enhancement of
the flat band intensity in our experimental results. However, other than this, the effect of moir´e
