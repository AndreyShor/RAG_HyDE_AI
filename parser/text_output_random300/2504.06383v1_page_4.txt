sphere during geomagnetic activity, our experiments sustain anisotropic electron populations
through continuous microwave heating. These driven systems exhibit a self-regulating cycle:
an external driver progressively builds up the electron anisotropy until it exceeds the thresh-
old for whistler instability, at which point whistler waves are excited. The waves then rapidly
scatter electrons in the parallel direction, reducing the anisotropy below the threshold, after
which the cycle repeats as anisotropy gradually rebuilds. This cyclic pattern of whistler
emissions is further validated by experiment-motivated particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations.
The experiments are conducted in the upgraded Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at the Ba-
sic Plasma Science Facility of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). LAPD is a
linear device with a 20 m long plasma column produced by a pulsed DC discharge. Figures
1(a) and 1(b) show the side and end views of the experimental setup. Thermal electrons
emitted from a heated cathode are accelerated by a mesh anode and collide with helium gas
in the chamber, producing ionized plasma [Figure 1(a)]. The experiments are performed in
the quiescent plasma that remains after the DC discharge is switched off (plasma afterglow).
The typical afterglow plasma density is ∼4 × 1011 cm−3, with an electron temperature of
∼0.5 eV. A static magnetic mirror, controlled by 10 sets of independently programmable coil
systems surrounding the vacuum chamber, is used to set the magnetic profile in the exper-
iments. The mirror section extends approximately 3.5 m, measured between regions where
B = 0.95Bmax. A 2.45 GHz magnetron heats electrons through electron-cyclotron-resonance
heating (ECRH). Microwaves propagate in the transverse electric mode with ˆEmicrowaves ∥ˆy
in the waveguide and become evanescent extraordinary (X-mode) waves as they enter the
plasma radially. This process preferentially heat electrons in the perpendicular direction,
sustaining an anisotropic population that serves as an energy source for whistler wave exci-
tation [34]. A three-axis high-frequency magnetic probe (commonly referred to as a B-dot
probe [35]) measures the resulting magnetic field fluctuations, positioned outside the mag-
netic mirror region at z = 3.2 m.
Two series of experiments are performed, as indicated in Figures 1(c) and 1(d). In EXP-A,
the end of the waveguide is positioned at x = −31 cm. Different magnetic mirror field profiles
are tested (see the Supplemental materials [36]), with ECR heating found to be most efficient
when the field minimum is 305 G (fmicrowave ≃3fce). The B-dot probe data is acquired at 3,
5, 7, 9 and 13 ms after microwave pulse initiation, with each shot lasting 200 µs. Throughout
these experiments, the frequency range of the excited waves remains nearly the same. Figure
