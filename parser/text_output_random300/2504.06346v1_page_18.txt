Figure 11: Rate-averaged angular observables as a function of q2. The measured values are
compared with SM predictions obtained using Ref. [47]. The SM predictions for ⟨A′
6⟩and ⟨A9⟩
are indistinguishable from zero.
time. Values of the angular observables measured in B0
s →ϕµ+µ−decays [20] are also
shown for comparison. The results are seen to be consistent with both the SM predictions
and the more precise measurements with B0
s →ϕµ+µ−decays. Further improvement in
precision, which will allow more stringent tests of the SM, can be anticipated with larger
data samples in future.
