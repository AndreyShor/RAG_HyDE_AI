FIG. 5. Density of states. Side-by-side comparison of the density of states of (a) d-wave and (b) nodeless anisotropic s-wave
superconductors computed using the RSum – (a1) and (b1) – and the mRes – (a2) and (b2) – methods for different numbers
of subdivisions N. In the d-wave case, the density of states for low values of N using the RSum accidentally and erroneously
resembles the result for the anisotropic nodeless s-wave system. This is not the case when computing the density using the
mRes prescription, which outperforms RSum in all cases. The densities are shifted such that the dashed horizontal lines mark
the zeros.

E −|∆θ| + iη and
we can straightforwardly carry out its integration by ap-
plying our mRes prescription. The results for d-wave and
nodeless anisotropic s-wave superconductors are shown
in Fig. 5, where the mRes method is shown to outper-
form the RSum. It can be seen even in this case that
the RSum at low N gives results that cannot distinguish
between the nodal and nodeless scenarios. This is better
resolved with mRes.

ERROR ANALYSIS
In this section, we quantify the error in our approxi-
mation. While the improvement in the cases discussed
here is visibly evident, it is important to understand the
bounds within which this prescription operates. Observe
that the main change of our method from the Riemann-
sum prescription is that the uniform weight δ of each
interval m is modified as
δ →
Sm(ω)
s(ω, ¯xm) ≈



δ
if m ̸= m∗,
S(ω, m∗)
s(ω, m∗)
otherwise.

As stated earlier, the prescription implements the Rie-
mann sum in all non-singular sub-intervals and replaces
the Riemann weight in the singular sub-interval with the
modified-residue weight. This weight removes the singu-
larity of I(ω, x) and leads to a finite result. A similar
substitution would apply for incorporation with other
integration methods.
Thus, what would have conven-
tionally required further subdivision of the sub-interval
to arrive at the right result, this prescription achieves
without the extra subdivisions. This is the source of the
improvement.
In fact, in Fig. 6, we show the normalized root mean
square error (RMSE) of the two methods as function of
N for all the cases presented in Figs. 1 to 3. Observe that
for N ranging from small to sufficiently large (∼103), we
have the residue prescription outperform the Riemann
sum by an order of magnitude in many cases. However,
observe that there is a crossover point (that is not reached
in all the panels) beyond which the Riemann sum outper-
forms the residue prescription. Although this happens at
N ∼103, which is already a relatively large number of
sub-intervals that will seldom be necessary in practice
and the error still decreases, it is incumbent on the pre-
senters of the prescription to address this tendency. This
is discussed next.
A.
Constraint on the sub-interval size
We first point out that there can be two types of
non-singular sub-intervals in our prescription.
One
where I(ω, x) is slowly varying (which is what was dis-
cussed above) and another where I(ω, x) is not singu-
lar, but medium-to-fastly varying. Ideally, if we chose
an appropriate size of the sub-interval, we would not
encounter these non-singular medium-fast-varying sub-
intervals. But as we reduce δ, we are bound to increase
the number of these sub-intervals. See Fig. 7 where this
