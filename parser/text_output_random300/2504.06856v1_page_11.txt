A. Evaluation Protocol Details
A.1. Blender parameters
We render images using Blender 3.3.21 with the Cycles rendering engine. Eval camera positions are taken from a sphere with
a radius of 1.4, where the spherical coordinates φ (azimuth angle) and θ (polar angle) are derived from the setup described in
Text2Tex. The HDRI light map from polyhaven used in our experiments is visualized in Figure 7(a); we set the environment
map strength to 0.7.

A.2. Details of User Study
Every assessor was asked to evaluate the setup shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8. Assessor’s evaluation setup. Professional assessors were tasked with evaluating the quality of the generated textures and selecting
the texture that best aligned with the suggested prompt. To ensure unbiased evaluations, the order of the methods was randomly shuffled for
each setup.
