The number of nodes, that is, the number of people in the community, was set to 𝑛=
100, based on Dunbar’s number (the maximum number of people in a group that can 
maintain a stable social state) [32,33]. The mean degree was set to a relatively small 
value, 𝑘𝜇= 4, based on the degree of social networks [34]. If the mean degree (or total 
degree = number of nodes × mean degree) is too large, all models will approach a 
complete graph, making it difficult to observe differences in their properties. In the 
calculation flow shown in Fig 2, two edges are generated per step, and the upper limit 
of the total degree (𝑛∙𝑘𝜇= 400) is reached at the 200-th step. Therefore, the maximum 
number of steps is set to 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥= 600, sufficiently larger than 200. 
 Fig 3A1 shows the results of the network graph of (a) the market economy 
at step 𝑡= 80. Similarly, 3B1 shows (b) the power economy, 3C1 shows (c) the gift 
economy, and 3D1 shows (d) the concession economy. Fig 3A2 shows (a) the market 
economy at step 𝑡= 400, 3B2 shows (b) the power economy, 3C2 shows (c) the gift 
economy, and 3D2 shows (d) the concession economy. The spring-electrical 
embedding method (a method that minimizes energy by setting the edges as springs and 
the nodes as electric charges) was used for the drawing.
