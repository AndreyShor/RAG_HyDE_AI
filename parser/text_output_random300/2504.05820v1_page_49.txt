Figure 2.1: Relative differences between the outcome of NNLO QCD evolution as implemented in EKO
with 20, 30, and 60 points to 120 interpolation points respectively. We used NNPDF4.0 as input PDF, the
upper and lower borders of the envelope correspond respectively to the 0.16 and 0.84 quintiles of the
replicas set, while the dashed lines correspond to one standard deviation. The distributions are evolved
in the range µF = 1.65 →102 GeV.
strategies and, specifically, the oscillating behavior is caused due to these difficulties. The spikes
for x →1 are not relevant since the PDFs are intrinsically small in this region (f(x) →0) and
thus small numerical differences are enhanced.
Solution strategies.
The formal solution of Eq. (1.75) in terms of evolution kernel operators
is given by Eq. (1.77). If the anomalous dimension γij is diagonal in flavor space, i.e. it is
in the non-singlet sector, it is always possible to find an analytical solution to Eq. (1.77). In
the singlet sector, however, this is only true at LO and to obtain a solution beyond, we need
to apply different approximations and solution strategies, on which EKO offers currently eight
implementations, which may differ only by the strategy in a specific sector. All provided
strategies agree at fixed order, but differ by higher order terms.
In Fig. 2.2 we show a comparison of a selected list of solution strategies: 2
• iterate-exact: In the non-singlet sector we take the analytical solution of Eq. (1.75)
up to the order specified. In the singlet sector we split the evolution path into segments
and linearize the exponential in each segment [60]. This provides effectively a straight
numerical solution of Eq. (1.75). In Fig. 2.2 we adopt this strategy as a reference.
• perturbative-exact: In the non-singlet sector it coincides with iterate-exact. In the
singlet sector we make an ansatz to determine the solution as a transformation U(as) of
the LO solution (see [119, Eq. 2.23]). We then iteratively determine the perturbative
coefficients of U.
