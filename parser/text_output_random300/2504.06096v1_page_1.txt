Observation of the very rare
Σ+ →pµ+µ−decay
LHCb collaboration†
Abstract
The first observation of the Σ+ →pµ+µ−decay is reported with high significance
using proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
5.4 fb−1, collected with the LHCb detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. A
yield of 237±16 Σ+ →pµ+µ−decays is obtained, where the uncertainty is statistical
only. A branching fraction of (1.08±0.17)×10−8 is measured, where the uncertainty
includes statistical and systematic sources. No evidence of resonant structures is
found in the dimuon invariant-mass distribution. All results are compatible with
Standard Model expectations. This represents the rarest decay of a baryon ever
observed.
