12 Determining the Ar-Ag(111) separation:
Supplementary density functional theory
methods
In addition to the LDA PAW-DFT results described in the main paper, we have
carried out an extensive set of DFT calculations at various levels of theory in order to
predict the separation of the encapsulated argon atom from the Ag(111) surface for the
Ar@C60 monolayer sample. The results are summarised in Table 3. Remarkably, we
find best agreement with the experimentally measured (i.e. NIXSW derived) value of
the Ar-Ag(111) separation from the most modest level of theory, i.e. LDA. Despite our
expectation that good agreement would require careful implementation of dispersion
force corrections, this surprisingly turned out to give substantially poorer agreement
with experiment (as is clear from Table 3). A set of images of the various molecular
adsorption configurations is available at the data repository for this paper.

Table 3 The Ar-Ag separations (in ˚A) calculated using different DFT functionals. The labels
of the columns use the nomenclature molecular orientation-binding site. The experimentally
determined value (see Fig. 3 of the main paper and associated discussion) is 5.54 ± 0.04 ˚A.
