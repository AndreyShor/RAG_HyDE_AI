where |0⊥⟩is an unnormalized state orthogonal to the projection onto the zero state of the first qubit. The
rescaling factor is λs
det = P
α |cs
α(Rs,0)| and the state can be amplified to near unity. Since there are usually
only a few non-zeros coefficients, this rescaling is fairly benign in practical settings (λs
det ≤√ndet in the
worst case) and the number of amplitude amplification rounds, which scales as O(λdet), is limited. A final
quantum Fourier transform (QFT) can be used to move to the plane-wave basis.
Pseudoion coordinate transformation
Defining the full set of pseuodion normal coordinates Ξs = (Rs
CoM, Ss, qs) for a species s and the function
f(Ξs, ls) = ftrans(Rs
CoM)frot(αs, cos βs, γs)fvib(qs, ls),
(76)
for ease, we have so far constructed the initial state (suppressing the species superscript),
|ΨPI
0 ⟩=
X
Ξ,l
f(Ξ, l)|Ξ⟩|l⟩.
We must transform from the normal mode basis |Ξ⟩to the plane-wave basis |P⟩= |P1, ..., Pηs
ion⟩. Denoting
the inverse Fourier transform of the plane wave basis (for pseudoions) as |R⟩= |R1, ..., Rηs
ion⟩, we use a sparse
oracle Ocoord that provides an injective map Ξ →R via Ocoord|Ξ⟩= |R⟩, constructed from a classically-
computed table that utilizes a grid matching description (see Sec. 4.4.2). This requires data loading with
a cost O(ηs
ion|G|) in the worst case. By an argument similar to the one made for electrons, this cost is a
subleading contribution in the overall cost of the algorithm. Performing the coordinate change, we obtain
(Ocoord ⊗I)

f(Ξ, l)|Ξ⟩|l⟩=

f(Ξ(R), l)|R(Ξ)⟩|l⟩≡

˜f(R, l)|R⟩|l⟩
where ˜f(R, l) := f(Ξ(R), l). We then perform a Quantum Fourier Transform to move to the plane-wave
basis |P⟩,
|ΨPI
0 ⟩=
X
P,l
f0(P, l)|P⟩|l⟩,
where f0 and ˜f are related by Fourier transform. This completes the construction of the approximate initial
state in the desired basis as needed for time-evolution.

Classical precomputations
We describe the classical pre-processing that must be performed in order to provide the requisite information
to construct the initial state.
Potential Energy Surface analysis and shape coordinates
We first find an appropriate minimum of the ground-state potential energy surface (PES) for fixed s, Es(Rs),
where Rs = {RI}I∈Is represents configurations of the chemical species described under the BO approxi-
mation Eq. (50). This can be accomplished, for example, by constructing the appropriate electronic energy
gradients by repeatedly computing approximate electronic energies for fixed pseudoion positions with a con-
ventional method such as DFT, and using gradient descent or other standard optimization techniques to find
a minimum Rs,0 = {Rs,0
I }I∈Is. Expanding the PES to second order around the equilibrium configuration
(the minimum),
Es(Rs) ≈Es(Rs,0) + 1
