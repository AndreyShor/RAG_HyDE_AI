where p0 is the initial momentum at τ = τ0.
In Figure 2, the trajectory r is plotted for various values of H0 as a function of the
mutual proper time of the two equal mass particles, with the corresponding phase space
trajectories plotted underneath. For a small H0, we see the distorted oval-shaped trajectory
similar to that in Figure 1. The corresponding motion (shown as the solid curve in the
upper diagram) is oscillatory, corresponding to the two particles ﬂying apart to some
maximal separation and then merging together to repeat the motion with their positions
interchanged. As H0 increases, we observe considerable distortion in the phase-space
trajectory. The motion becomes increasingly asymmetric over a given half-period, with the
maximal separation occurring at relatively smaller values of τ. For most of the motion,
p > 0; once p < 0, the particles rapidly merge together to then repeat the motion with their
positions switched.
Figure 2. Top: A plot of the relativistic trajectories of neutral particles of equal mass as a function of
their mutual proper time for various values of the conserved energy H0. All motions begin at r = 0
with an initial momentum given by solving (93). Bottom: The corresponding phase-space plots for the
top diagram. Note that the curves for the largest value of H0 extend outside the range of the figure.
