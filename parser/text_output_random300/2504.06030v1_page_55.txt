These results show that the particle paths spiral on to the circular orbit with radius

, in the plane z = 0.
To get a sense of the spiral orbit we consider those particles for which z0 = 0 and thus
z(t) = 0 for t > 0. In this case we look at the polar distance ρ =

show that,

The equation for ρ is identical to the equation for r from which we deduce that as
t →∞, ρ →rc, as expected. For the polar equation ρ = ρ(ϕ) we note that,
dρ
dϕ = −

λ(λ + σ2)(ρ2 −rcρ),

where ρ0 = ρ(t = 0) and ϕ = 0 when t = 0. Again, as expected, ρ →rc as ϕ →∞.
If we assume ρ > ρ0 > rc i.e we are looking for particles approaching from the outer
parts of the system then the above solution gives,
ρ = ρ(ϕ) =
rc
(1 −be−αϕ),
ϕ > 0,
where b = ρ0 −rc

and α = (λ −σ2)
(λ + σ2).
Could this be a suitable model for the spiral arm of a spiral galaxy? To test this idea
we develop a simple test involving the arc length of a spiral arm between ϕ0 and ϕ. The
arc length, L, of a polar curve, ρ = ρ(ϕ), is given by
