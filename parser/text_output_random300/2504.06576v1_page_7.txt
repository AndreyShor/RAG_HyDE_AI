3.3. Coupling Effects of Magnetic Field and Flow
The most concerning physical problem is how an external magnetic field impacts the flow
characteristics within the boundary layer. In this section, the velocity profile, the damping
force acting on the wall, flux of the boundary layer are investigated, respectively. The influence
of the magnetic field on these factors is analyzed. The most significant first analytical solution
will be the focus of further discussion.
3.3.1. Velocity Distribution
Figure 2 illustrates the effect of the Stuart number on the velocity profile of the boundary
layer. The overall velocity gradient of the boundary layer increases with an increase in the
Stuart number. This observation signifies that an increase in the Lorentz force results in a
reduction of the boundary layer thickness. Furthermore, the response of the boundary layer
to the strength of the magnetic field demonstrates nonlinear characteristics.
3.3.2. Friction and Thickness
The damping effect on the wall, known as friction, caused by the viscosity of boundary
layer flow, is an important physics problem that has received special attention. Based on the
discussions above, it can be concluded that the normal gradient of flow velocity is influenced
by the magnetic field, as indicated by the trend in boundary layer thickness. A quantitative
and straightforward relationship needs to be derived to address this issue. Additionally, this
relationship will help determine the extent to which magnetic field strength impacts friction.
