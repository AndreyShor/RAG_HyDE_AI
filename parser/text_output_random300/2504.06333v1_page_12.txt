compose (or has a unique ground state as a topological phase), the theory resulting
from the Rep(G) resolution may decompose or have multiple vacua. Due to one of
the key properties of ’t Hooft anomaly is obstruction to the trivially gapped phase,
therefore, in this paper, we focus on the resolution where the resulting theory does
not decompose (before doing any gauging). That is to say, with respect to the
larger nonanomalous symmetry, the anomalous theory we start with is a igSPT
phase [10].

General case: Quasi-Hopf algebra formulation
Before discussing how one resolves anomalies in an algebraic setting, let us begin
by characterizing obstructions to gauging noninvertible symmetries. Brieﬂy, given
a noninvertible symmetry deﬁned by some fusion category, in order to gauge it
the fusion category needs to contain a special symmetric Frobenius algebra ob-
ject. One way to guarantee the existence of a special symmetric Frobenius algebra
object is if the fusion category admits a ﬁber functor. However, there exist exam-
ples of fusion categories without ﬁber functors that still admit special symmetric
Frobenius algebra objects (for example, the Fibonacci category).
So, existence of a ﬁber functor is not the same thing as gaugeability.
That said, for our purposes, we will focus on cases where anomalies can be
understood as a lack of a ﬁber functor obstructing existence of a special symmetric
Frobenius algebra object, and hence obstructing gaugeability. Then, as deﬁned in
Section 3, an anomaly resolution is an exact sequence1 of fusion categories
K Ð→C Ð→D,

1As explained in Appendix C, the deﬁnition of an exact sequence of fusion categories we adopt
in this paper is that of [12]. However, there exists a more general deﬁnition, due to [13], which
does not require K to admit a ﬁber functor.
