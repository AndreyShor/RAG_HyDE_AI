Fig. 3. Zonally- and time-averaged surface temperature profiles for two different values of 𝐹0: 𝐹0 = 0 m.s-1.day-1
(control run, blue curve) and 𝐹0 = 4 m.s-1.day-1 (superrotating state, orange curve). The value of the globally-
averaged surface temperature in each case is given in the legend.

surface warming that can only be explained by the radiative response of the atmosphere to the
imposed circulation change. These radiative forcings and feedbacks are explored in Section 4.
c. Precipitation
The zonally- and time-averaged precipitation rates and the globally-averaged precipitation rates
for the different values of 𝐹0 and different experiment setups are shown in Figure 4.
In the
interactive-SST control run (Fig. 4, a), the precipitation rate exhibits the standard meridional
structure with a dominant peak located at the equator (i.e., the ITCZ) and two minima in subtropical
regions, centered around 30◦, coinciding with the descending branches of the Hadley cells (Fig. 1).
There are two secondary peaks in the mid-latitudes, at approximately 45◦, on the poleward flanks
of the jet stream; poleward of 45◦the precipitation rate decreases sharply. The control run in the
fixed-SST case is very similar (Fig. 4, b), with the only exception being that there is a split ITCZ
with two roughly symmetric peaks located approximately 5◦north and south of the equator. The
globally-averaged precipitation rates for the interactive- and fixed-SST cases are similar.
