Using this definition, the main theorem in [254] is expressed as the following theorem.
Theorem 10. Consider a DI-QKD protocol based on a two-player non-local game G2 between Alice and
Bob, with quantum winning probability ω2. Suppose an adversary (Eve) holds quantum side information
and may launch general coherent attacks, which can be modeled by extending the game to a three-party
non-local game G3 with quantum winning probability ω3 < ω2. Then, there exists an affine min-tradeoff
function f : [0, 1] →R, defined for any β ∈[ω3, ω2] by
f(p) = p −β
ln 2 (1 −β + ω3) −log(1 −β + ω3),
(117)
such that the smooth min-entropy of Alice’s raw key conditioned on Eve’s quantum side information and
public communication, satisfies
Hε
min(A|E) ≥nf(pexp) −O(√n),
(118)
where pexp ∈[0, 1] is the observed winning probability in the testing rounds.
The monogamy-of-entanglement property in this setting is reflected in the fact that the optimal quantum
winning probability ω2 of the two-player non-local game (played between Alice and Bob) exceeds the
tripartite quantum winning probability ω3 of the extended game, in which a third party receives both
inputs and attempts to guess the key bit produced by Alice and Bob.
Theorem 10 implies that it is indeed possible to construct DI-QKD — and prove their security —
from any two-player non-local game that exhibits a sufficiently large gap ω2 > ω3 between the two-party
and three-party instances of the game.
(G)EAT vs. iid and non-iid techniques. (G)EAT is more general in the sense that it does not need
to assume that the rounds of the experiment are independent and identically distributed (iid). This, in
particular, implies that (i) the measurement devices are memoryless, i.e. they behave independently
and in the same way in every round of the protocol;(ii) the distributed state is the same for every
round ρAn

1 E = ρ⊗n
ABE.
The iid simplification can be justified, for example, in experimental setups
where Alice and Bob control, to some extent, the source and measurement devices, but do not have a
full characterization of their working devices. In this case, Hε
min(Kn
1 | En
1 ) can be directly related to
the single-round conditional von Neumann entropy H(Ki|Ei) and (G)EAT is equivalent to the quantum
asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) [268] yielding

1 ) ≥nH(Ki | Ei) −cε
√n,
(119)
where cε is dependent only on ε and H(Ki | Ei) ≤1 −χ0 of Eq. (69) for CHSH protocol.
(G)EAT improves the traditional DI-QKD security proofs under coherent attacks [65, 66]. This, in
particular, assumes that Eve exploits all dof of the quantum systems, applying global operations across all
protocol rounds ρABE = ρAnBnE and a global measurement ME on ρE.Let us consider CHSH protocol

to security proofs obtained via (G)EAT.
