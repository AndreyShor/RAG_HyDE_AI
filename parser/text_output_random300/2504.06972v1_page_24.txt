Extended Data Fig. 3 | Temperature dependence of magnetic hysteresis scans for the 
IQAH, FQAH, and reentrant IQAH states. B-dependent ρxx and ρxy measured at varying 
temperatures of the IQAH state (a,b), the RIQAH states (c-f), and the FQAH states (g-l). In 
these plots, ρxx has been symmetrized with respect to B, while ρxy is shown after subtracting an 
offset from the raw data, without being anti-symmetrized. The specific νh, D values are labeled 
in each figure correspondingly.
