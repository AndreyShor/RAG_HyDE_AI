Figure 4. The power dependence of hot-electron extraction with electron doped and 
neutral MoSe2. (a, b) The 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 dynamics with pump fluence varying from 5.2 to 83 
μJ/cm2, corresponding to 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 from about 0.2 to 3.3×1012 cm-2. 𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷 is set to 6.45 V 
and 0 V, corresponding to electron doped MoSe2 with 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 about 4.6 ×1012 cm-2 and 
neutral MoSe2, respectively. 𝑉𝑉𝐸𝐸 is kept at 0 V. The dynamics is fitted with a two-
exponential function (dashed). (c, d) The power dependence of 𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸,𝑚𝑚 (c) and hot-
electron extraction efficiency (d) for the two doping scenarios. The straight dashed line 
is to highlight sub-linear behavior.
