Hawking evaporation
As seen in Fig. 2, once the Gaussian peak has entered the horizon, the fractional energy
density of PBH reaches the plateau and gets fixed to a constant value. For reasons obvious
in the following, we call this time the “initial” time and label it as
tin = tkpeak/8.
(3.6)
According to Hawking [59], PBH evaporates and emits particles with an approximate
thermal spectrum corresponding to the temperature TPBH = M2
pl/MPBH (based on Hawking
evaporation). However, due to this particle emission, the PBH loses mass at a rate given
by [64, 86, 87]

where the constant A is given by

480 gH,
(3.8)
with gH being the spin-weighted degrees of freedom, which we assume to be gH ≃108
(corresponding to standard model degrees of freedom) for MPBH ≪1011g. In our case,
we have an extended mass distribution, contrary to the standard monochromatic case. To
simplify, we assume that the mean PBH mass corresponds to the mass of the PBH formed
at the peak of the distribution, that is
MPBH,0 = Mf(kpeak).

By integrating eqn. (3.7), one obtains the following time-dependence of the mass

Boltzmann equations for the evolution of the energy densities
Considering now the energy transfer from the inflaton field to the PBH and then to ra-
diation, we consider the following Boltzmann equations for the evolution of the energy
densities [64]:
˙ρPBH + (3H + ΓPBH) ρPBH = 0
˙ρϕ + (3H + Γϕ) ρϕ = 0
˙ρr + 4Hρr −ΓPBH ρPBH −Γϕ ρϕ = 0,
(3.12)
where ρPBH, ρϕ, and ρr represent the energy densities of PBH, scalar field, and radiation,
respectively. To solve the system (3.12) we use the following set of initial conditions
ρPBH(tin) = ΩPBH(tin)ρT (tin)
ρϕ(tin) = (1 −ΩPBH(tin))ρT (tin)
ρr(tin) = 0,
