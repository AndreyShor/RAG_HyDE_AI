Figure 3: The first set of examples comparing the ground truth and predictions of the physics-informed KAN PointNet for
the velocity, pressure, and temperature fields. The Jacobi polynomial used has a degree of 2, with 𝛼= 𝛽= −0.5. Here,
𝑛𝑠= 0.5.
6.1. General analysis
6.1.1. Visual comparison and overall outcomes
To begin with, we consider the setup of PI-KAN-PointNet, where the degree of the Jacobi polynomial is set to
2, and 𝛼= 𝛽= −0.5 (i.e., the Chebyshev polynomial), with 𝑛𝑠= 0.5. The error analysis of this configuration for
simultaneously solving the inverse problem over 135 geometries (𝑚= 135) is reported in the second column of Table
2. As observed, the average relative pointwise error (𝐿2 norm) for the velocity, pressure, and temperature fields, as
well as the temperature on the surface of the inner cylinder, is below 10.9%. Specifically, this error for the pressure and
temperature fields remains under 3%. Moreover, PI-KAN-PointNet successfully estimates the unknown temperature
on the surface of the inner cylinder, with a maximum relative pointwise error (𝐿2 norm) of less than 1%.
As a few examples, the velocity, pressure, and temperature fields for domains with inner cylinders in the shapes of
an octagon, heptagon, and nonagon are visualized in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, and Fig. 5, respectively. In each of these figures, the
predictions by PI-KAN-PointNet, the numerical solver solution (serving as the ground truth), and the corresponding
absolute pointwise error are shown. This visual comparison demonstrates a good agreement between the predicted
and ground truth solutions. The maximum error for all variables occurs near or on the surface of the inner cylinders.
This is primarily due to the fact that, across different domains in the dataset, the most significant geometric variations
occur along the inner surface. Moreover, from a mathematical perspective, since the temperature at the surface of the
inner cylinder is unknown in the defined inverse problem, the temperature variable exhibits the highest error along this
surface. This local temperature error propagates to the surface of the inner cylinder at the velocity and pressure fields
as well, given that these variables are coupled (see Eqs. 1–3).
To better understand the effects of the inner cylinders’ geometry on the performance of PI-KAN-PointNet, we
plot the absolute pointwise errors for the domains where the maximum and minimum relative pointwise errors of
each quantity occur in Fig. 6. Interestingly, the maximum error for all variables occurs in the domain where the inner
cylinder has a hexagonal shape. Conversely, the minimum error for all variables is observed in the domain where the
inner cylinder has a nonagonal shape. This observation demonstrates that sharper corners introduce greater challenges
