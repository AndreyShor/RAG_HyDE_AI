Figure 2: Fractional energy density of PBH for a) kpeak = 10−2kend and b) kpeak = 10−1kend as a function
of the number of efolds N. Here, kend = 5.7 × 1024Mpc−1 is the scale corresponding to the end of inflation,
which exits the horizon approximately Nend = 60 e-folds after the pivot scale. The vertical dashed line to
the left corresponds to the point where the peak enters the horizon and the one to the left when the scale
kpeak/8 enters the horizon. The horizontal dashed line corresponds to ΩPBH(t) = 1.
where the lower limit represents the moment in cosmic time t at which the wavenumber
k crosses the horizon, c.f. eqn. (3.2), and the factor of 3 comes from the relation between
d ln(Mf) and d ln(k), see eqn. (3.4). The results for the numerical integration of (3.5) are
shown in Fig. 2 as a function of the number of efolds N from the end of inflation (Nend) for
two values of the position of the Gaussian peak, 10−2kend, and 10−1kend, with its amplitude
ranging from 10−3 to 1. We observe that as we move the Gaussian peak towards higher
scales, it takes more time for ΩPBH to grow and (potentially) dominate. Moreover, we also
observe the appearance of a plateau for high values of N, whose amplitude depends on
Apeak, see App. B for details. This clearly reflects the fact that the inflationary spectrum
Pinf
R hardly contributes to the mass fraction, and once the peak has entered the horizon,
ΩPBH stays fixed to a constant value. We consider that the totality of the peak has entered
the horizon when the scale kpeak/8 enters, which approximately corresponds to a distance of
10σ from the peak. This is the reason why the numerical computation of (3.3) is terminated
at the moment tkpeak/8, represented by the vertical dashed line to the right, when the scale
kpeak/8 enters the horizon and ΩPBH is fixed on the plateau. However, we remark that the
choice of 10σ is just orientative, and one could, in principle, choose either higher or lower
values for this scale. In App. B, we show some analytical approximations to the fractional
energy density of PBH (3.5), where the dependence with the parameters of the model,
specifically with Apeak, is revealed.
In principle, one could consider other non-spherical effects in the formation probability
of the PBH under the KP formalism, such as the inhomogeneity effect [22, 26, 84], or the
angular momentum of the black holes [85]. If that is the case, the total mass fraction is
computed as the product of the individual mass fractions associated with each effect. We
however restrict this work to the anisotropy effect, as it is the dominant one.
