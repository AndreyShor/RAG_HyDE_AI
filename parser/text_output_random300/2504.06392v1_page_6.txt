The dressed ﬁeld equations E(φυ) = 0 have the same
functional expression of the bare ones, E(φ) = 0 (given
in [31]) and they are susy-invariant at 1st order. They
are deterministic, meaning that they uniquely determine
the evolution of the relational d.o.f. of the theory. This
showcases the relational version of the N = 2, D = 4
pure sugra model, where susy-invariance is implemented
at 1st order.
Since all the ﬁelds in the model are now dressed in such
a way as to be invariant under susy transformations, it
follows that
[δε, δε′] (V a)υ = 0,
[δε, δε′] (ψA)υ = 0,
[δε, δε′] (A)υ = 0,
[δε, δε′] (ωab)υ = 0,
(34)
which in fact circumvents the issue of the on-shell closure
of susy transformations on the (bare) ﬁelds.
Observe that the dressed ﬁelds still transform under
the residual gauge symmetries of the 1st kind remaining
after susy has been reduced, that is under Lorentz trans-
formations, SO(2) gauge transformations, and bosonic
spacetime diﬀeomorphisms. Calling the residual gauge
group J , we can thus say that the model in which susy
has been reduced is thus a J -theory.
Let us ﬁnally mention that the same procedure of susy
reduction via the DFM can be applied to the N = 2 su-
persymmetric extension of the MacDowell-Mansouri the-
ory presented in [39], where a boundary term is added
to the bulk N = 2, D = 4 sugra theory to restore susy
invariance of the action in the presence of a non-trivial
boundary of spacetime – that is, when the ﬁelds do not
asymptotically vanish at the boundary. This situation,
whereby the presence of non-trivial boundaries in M
break Diﬀ(M) (or superdiﬀeomorphisms, in supersym-
metric ﬁeld theory in superspace) or H-gauge symme-
tries, also commonly referred to as the boundary problem,
has the same conceptual structure as a hole argument,
and can be therefore dissolved by the point-coincidence
argument – see, e.g., [40] and references therein. This
is technically implemented via the DFM [24, 41]. The
boundary problem dissolves once it is recognised that
a physical spacetime boundaries are relationally deﬁned,
and therefore are invariant.
Regardless of this, observation, and as we have dis-
cussed in Section III B, one can dress the ﬁeld content as
discussed above and consider another Lagrangian func-
tional of the dressed variables for the N = 2, D = 4 sugra
theory, such as the supersymmetric MacDowell-Mansouri
functional.

DISCUSSION
We have shown that applying the DFM to supersym-
metric ﬁeld theory allows one to circumvent the problem
of on-shell closure of susy transformations. This leads
to a new, manifestly invariant and relational approach to
supersymmetric theories, in which susy is reduced. Typi-
cally, the procedure involves non-local dressing ﬁelds, yet
the resulting formulation may prove more amenable to
quantization, as it achieves manifest invariance without
the need for auxiliary ﬁelds. In doing so, we have focused
primarily on point (ii) discussed in the introduction.
As for point (i), the issue of matching bosonic and
fermionic d.o.f. oﬀ-shell (and of course on-shell) may be
addressed by circumventing the traditional no-go theo-
rem of susy [16], which asserts the impossibility of oﬀ-
shell formulations without an inﬁnite number of auxil-
iary ﬁelds. A viable strategy involves introducing a ﬁnite
number of auxiliary ﬁelds by making use of the so-called
(dual formulation of) hidden superalgebras underlying
supersymmetric theories in the presence of tensor ﬁelds
– namely, higher-degree diﬀerential forms. Alternative
oﬀ-shell formulations, potentially involving a ﬁnite set of
auxiliary ﬁelds, could in fact emerge from superspace ex-
tensions distinct from the standard harmonic or projec-
tive ones. A promising avenue in this direction is indeed
oﬀered by the hidden superalgebra framework [42], which
deﬁnes an extension of superspace incorporating not only
additional even directions but also new odd directions
associated with spin-3/2 ﬁelds [42–47]. Such an exten-
sion might allow one to evade the assumptions of the no-
go theorem, which traditionally only considers auxiliary
spin-1/2 ﬁelds, as anticipated in [18], in particular think-
ing of (re-)constructing the theory directly in terms of
the extra forms involved. Preliminary results supporting
this approach can be found in [48, 49].
Since these frameworks involve higher-degree diﬀeren-
tial forms (see also [50]), it is natural to expect that the
notion of higher dressing will become relevant in this
context [38]. Moreover, to construct the full spectrum
of higher structures within a superspace formalism, re-
cent developments in the literature – such as the use of
the Poincar´e–Hilbert series and the Molien–Weyl formula
[51, 52] – may oﬀer particularly powerful tools.
Another possibility consists in reducing susy by imple-
menting alternative dressing functional constraints, dif-
ferent from those presented so far for standard susy –
for instance, the one considered in [29]. These allow for
a diﬀerent reduction and rearrangement of bosonic and
fermionic d.o.f., already at the purely kinematical level,
which may assist in achieving a matching of bosonic and
fermionic d.o.f. oﬀ-shell. For example, one may think of
reducing the oﬀ-shell d.o.f. of the extra fermionic 1-form
ﬁelds appearing in the dual form of the hidden superal-
gebra to spin-1/2 ﬁelds, reducing the symmetry trans-
formations naturally induced by the presence of these
objects. A similar argument may also be applied to the
(extra) bosonic 1-form ﬁelds.
