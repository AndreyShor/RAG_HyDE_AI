Specific humidity flux w′q′ at criticality, plotted for varying: surface temperature (top left), surface
relative humidity (top right), and radiative cooling (bottom). Dashed lines mark the LFCs and dotted lines
mark the LCLs of the different environments. The eigenvectors are normalised such that max(wr) = 5 × 10−4
and wi = 0.
imposed by varying the climate parameters, namely the surface temperature, the
radiative cooling rate and the surface relative humidity: we illustrate a typical climate
change scenario by doubling the radiative cooling in response to a 10K increase in
surface temperature, keeping the surface relative humidity fixed.
The fundamental linear behaviour of the Rainy-B´enard model has been studied
using a basic state analysis (Section 3) and a linear stability analysis (Section 4),
and quantified using both moisture and conditional instability diagnostics. The basic
state solution was found analytically to higher accuracy than in Oishi and Brown
(2024), so that the condensation and precipitation are non-zero (consistent with
the budgets derived in Section 2.3). The pseudoadiabtic boundary conditions taken
at the top boundary allow realistic adjustment in the basic state solution to close
to the neutral parcel profile (Figure 4), which is a well-observed feature of tropical
convective environments (e.g. Betts (1986)) and was not possible in the previous
studies by Vallis et al. (2019), Agasthya et al. (2025), and, Oishi and Brown (2024).
The basic state analysis reveals that the radiative cooling parameter is primarily
responsible for changes in the (basic state) conditional instability, whereas the surface
temperature and surface relative humidity are responsible for changes in the (basic
state) precipitation (Figures 5 and 6).
We used a linear instability analysis to calculate the critical Rayleigh number
