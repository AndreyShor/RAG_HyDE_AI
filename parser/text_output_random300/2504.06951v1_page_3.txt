is sufficient. However, as stressed in the conclusions, the natural setting would require either d > 1 or r > 1.
Definition 1. (Singular Value and Eigenvalue Distribution of a Matrix-Sequence). Let {An}n be a matrix-
sequence, with An of size dn, and let ψ : D ⊂Rt →C be a measurable function defined on a set D with
0 < µt(D) < ∞.
• We say that {An}n has an (asymptotic) singular value distribution described by ψ, and we write
{An}n ∼σ ψ, if

• If ψ describes both the singular value and eigenvalue distribution of {An}n, we write {An}n ∼σ,λ ψ.
When {An}n ∼λ ψ, the function ψ is referred to as the eigenvalue (or spectral) symbol of {An}n.

Zero-distributed sequences
Zero-distributed sequences are defined as matrix-sequences {An}n such that {An}n ∼σ 0. The following
theorem, taken from [14], provides a useful characterization for detecting this type of sequence. We use the
natural convention 1/∞= 0.
Theorem 1. Let {An}n be a matrix-sequence, with An of size dn and let p ∈[1, ∞], with ∥X∥p being the
Schatten p norm of X, that is the lp norm of the vector its singular values. Let ∥· ∥= ∥· ∥∞be the spectral
norm. Then
• {An}n ∼σ 0 if and only if An = Rn + Nn with rank(Rn)/dn →0 and ∥Nn∥→0 as n →∞;
• {An}n ∼σ 0 if there exists p ∈[1, ∞] such that ∥An∥p/d1/p
n
→0 as n →∞.

Unilevel scalar Toeplitz matrices
Given n ∈N, a matrix of the form
[Ai−j]n
i,j=1 ∈Cn×n,
with entries Ak ∈C, k ∈[−(n −1), . . . , n −1], is called Toeplitz matrix.
Given a matrix-valued function f : [−π, π] →C belonging to L1([−π, π]), the n-th Toeplitz matrix associated
with f is defined as
Tn(f) := [ ˆfi−j]n
i,j=1 ∈Cn×n,
