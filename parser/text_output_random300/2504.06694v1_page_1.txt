COMPARISON OF FROBENIUS ALGEBRA STRUCTURES
ON CALABI–YAU TORIC HYPERSURFACES
JEEHOON PARK AND PHILSANG YOO
Abstract. We establish an isomorphism between two Frobenius algebra structures, termed CY and
LG, on the primitive cohomology of a smooth Calabi–Yau hypersurface in a simplicial Gorenstein toric
Fano variety. As an application of our comparison isomorphism, we observe the existence of a Frobe-
nius manifold structure on a ﬁnite-dimensional subalgebra of the Jacobian algebra of a homogeneous
polynomial which may exhibit a non-compact singularity locus.

1. Introduction
Let f ∈C[z] = C[z1, · · · , zr] be a homogeneous polynomial satisfying f(0) = 0. Let us assume that f
has an isolated singularity at the origin, i.e., the critical locus of f
Crit(f) :=

is a singleton consisting of the origin. Then the Jacobian algebra,
R(f) := C[z]/J(f)
where
J(f) =

is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space over C, and it is well-known that K. Saito’s theory of primitive
forms and higher residue pairings ([17], [18], and [19]) provides a (formal) non-trivial Frobenius manifold
structure on the Jacobian algebra R(f).1
A natural question is whether a Frobenius manifold can be associated with a polynomial f that has
a non-isolated singularity. Clearly, Saito’s theory cannot be applied; after all, R(f) is not even ﬁnite-
dimensional unless the critical locus consists of ﬁnitely many points. Earlier works [16], [14] explored the
case of non-isolated critical loci using characteristic p methods. More recently, Li and Wen [11] introduced
Hodge-theoretic methods to construct a Frobenius manifold for polynomials with compact critical loci,
drawing parallels to the work of Barannikov and Kontsevich [2]. These approaches overlap in some cases
but also address scenarios not covered by others. In this article, through a comparison isomorphism
between two Frobenius algebra structures (Theorem 1.1) we provide an indirect way of showing the
existence of Frobenius manifold structures for a class of polynomials with possibly non-compact critical
loci.

1In fact, Saito’s construction yields a stronger result: an analytic Frobenius manifold structure, rather than just a
formal one. This is achieved by solving a Birkhoﬀfactorization problem.
