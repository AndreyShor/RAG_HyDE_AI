exhibits a remarkable crossover behavior: As a function of time, the quantity exhibits a
clear crossover between two distinct dynamical regimes. At short times t ≪1/λ, coherent
dynamics dominate, and P1(t) displays pronounced Rabi-like oscillations. At longer times,
decoherence effects prevail, leading to an exponential decay of the form P1(t) ∼exp(−λt), see
Fig. 2. Here, as discussed above, λ is the inverse of the average time between two subsequent
application of pulses.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our model in detail in
Subsection 2.1 and proceed towards analyzing it using the stochastic Liouville equation
approach described above. Here, our objective is to compute the stay-put probability P1(t),
which we take up in Subsection 2.2. The subsection is further divided into several small
subsections, Section 2.2.1 – Section 2.2.4, each of which is devoted to computation of various
terms that contribute to the final expression for P1(t) in the Laplace domain, Eq. (31). We then
check in Subsection 2.2.5 certain known limiting cases of our derived result. The following
subsection is devoted to analyzing and discussing the behavior of the stay-put probability and
highlighting in particular the coherence-to-decoherence crossover behavior that it exhibits.
The paper ends with conclusions in Section 3.
2. Our model system and its analysis
2.1. The model
We now come to the specifics of our model system. Consider a three-level closed quantum
system at zero temperature, with energy levels |1⟩, |2⟩, and |3⟩, and with |1⟩⟨1| + |2⟩⟨2| +
|3⟩⟨3| = I, the 3 × 3 identity operator. Also, the states |1⟩, |2⟩, and |3⟩form a complete set
of orthornormal states. The system under its unitary evolution can access only levels 1 and
2, and not level 3. However, at random instants of time distributed according to a Poisson
distribution, the system is subject to pulses of infinitesimal duration that induce transitions
between levels 2 and 3. In other words, if the system prior to the application of a pulse is in
level 2, the pulse would project the system to level 3, and vice versa. In the framework of
Eq. (2), we have
H0 ≡ε1|1⟩⟨1|+ε2|2⟩⟨2|+ε3|3⟩⟨3|+∆(|1⟩⟨2|+|2⟩⟨1|)

as the bare Hamiltonian of the system that leads to its coherent evolution between two time
instants of the application of pulses, with ε1, ε2 and ε3 being the energies of the three levels.
The term proportional to ∆results in transitions between levels 1 and 2. On the other hand,
the operators Vp are given by
Vp = θp(|2⟩⟨3|+|3⟩⟨2|) = θpS; S ≡|2⟩⟨3|+|3⟩⟨2|.
(10)
Here, θp, a random variable, denotes the strength of the pulse that is applied at time instant tp.
We take the random variables θp to be completely uncorrelated for different p’s. The random
times tp and the random pulse strengths θp are the two sources of (classical) randomness in
the dynamics, besides the quantum randomness arising due to inherent quantum fluctuations.
