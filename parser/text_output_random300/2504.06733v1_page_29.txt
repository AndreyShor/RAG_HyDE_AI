Fig. S6 Doniach-Sunjic asymmetry in monolayer photoemission lineshapes. The (a) Ar 2p
and (b) C 1s photoemission lineshapes (ℏω = 400 eV) for the Ar@C60 monolayer show a pronounced
asymmetry to higher binding energy that arises from the response of the metallic conduction electron
gas to the creation of the core hole[13, 14]. We have fitted the asymmetric lineshape in each case to
a Doniach-Sunjic function[13], but also have to account for an additional asymmetry due to a small
amount of additional adsorbed endofullerene above the first monolayer (shaded in purple in the fits
above). Each peak compromises two components: one for the monolayer (fitted with an asymmetric
DS profile), and a second, much lower intensity, contribution at higher binding energy arising from
physisorbed endofullerene on top of the chemisorbed monolayer. The contributions from the phys-
iorbed molecules are each fitted with a symmetric Voigt lineshape. The asymmetry parameters, α,
for the C 1s and Ar 2p spectra, 0.243 ± 0.007 and 0.28 ± 0.02, respectively, are very similar. (The
error bars are determined from the covariance matrix of the fit.)

Fig. S7 Comparison of C 1s spectrum for monolayer C60 and Ar@C60 on Ag(111).
Red line: C 1s spectrum for ∼1 ML Ar@C60 on Ag(111) artificially broadened by convolution with
a Gaussian of 0.4 eV FWHM to match experimental resolution of Pedio et al.[15], who reported C 1s
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra for a variety of C60-on-metal systems, including
C60 on Ag(111). Pedio et al.’s spectrum is shown as the filled-circles-with-line curve and has been
digitally cut from Fig. 4 of their paper[15], scaled appropriately, aligned, and superimposed on the
broadened spectrum for Ar@C60. (The original, unbroadened C 1s spectrum for ∼1 monolayer of
Ar@C60 on Ag(111) is shown in the inset.)
