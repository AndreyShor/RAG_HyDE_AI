FIG. 10. (a) Population density of A particles as a function of σA and λA at pω = 0.015. A particles becomes extinct in
low σA and λA region and coexist with B, C particles in the high σA and λA region. Within the coexistence region, lower
σA corresponds to higher density of A and vice versa. (b) The density of three different types of particles as a function of
σA at λA = 1.0. (c, d, e) Three different types of behaviour of the system at σA = 1.0, 0.5, 0.0 respectively, corresponding to
symmetric coexistence, asymmetric coexistence where A has increased density and extinction where all three types of particles
become extinct. All simulations are performed with L = 300 and T = 105.

Particle Demographic Data
These data for particle hunger levels are interesting
for the ecological context of this model, because large
numbers of hungry particles are optimal for the species
population, even though these particles have individu-
ally lower fitness (lower reproduction rate) [93–96]. Mo-
tivated by this observation, we analyse individual parti-
cles’ properties in more detail.
As discussed in Sec. II A, we keep track of three
particle-specific quantities: age, predation count, and re-
production count. These quantities accumulate through-
out the lifetime of individual particles.
When a par-
ticle dies, we record these quantities and collect their
statistics. For any steady state, the average reproduc-
tion count is always unity (because every particle dies
exactly once, and a steady state must have the number
of births matching the number of deaths).
We run simulations on L × L = 300 × 300 systems of
3 × 105 MCS. During the first 105 MCS we allow the
system to relax into its steady state. We collect particle
statistics for the following 2 × 105 MCS.
Figure 11(a,c,d) shows histograms for predation count,
particle lifetime, and reproduction count.
Fig. 11(b)
shows the histogram for the fraction f ′′
X of particles in the
highest hunger level. (We compare the symmetric case
with (σA, λA) = (0.5, 1.0) similar to Table IV.) Similar
data for pω = 0.005 is shown in Appendix A for com-
pleteness. These results have several features. First, the
non-symmetric case does indeed have reduced predation
counts for A. Second, the fraction of A particles in hunger
level 2 is correspondingly increased, consistent with Ta-
ble IV; the corresponding fraction of B particles is also
enhanced (presumably because their prey species C are
suppressed). The fraction of C particles in this hunger
level is reduced because their prey species A is numerous.
Third, the lifetime of the A particles is enhanced, which
we attribute to the low population of their predators (C).
Similarly, B is also enhanced, because their predators (A)
have reduced predation rate λA. Fourth, the distribution
