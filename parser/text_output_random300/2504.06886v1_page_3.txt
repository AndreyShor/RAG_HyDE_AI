Numerical results.
We investigate QCD thermody-
namics employing a 2+1 flavor LEFT within the fRG
approach. As demonstrated in Ref. [43], this approach
yields an equation of state (EoS) and baryon number fluc-
tuations consistent with lattice QCD calculations. The
setup of our LEFT is also recapitulated in the supple-
mental materials of this letter.
To proceed, we systematically calculate the tempera-
ture derivatives of pressure:
χn = T n−4 ∂np
∂T n ,
(11)
which is dimensionless by means of normalization with
appropriate powers of T. From the state function Ωin
Eq. (1), we identify the first and second order deriva-
tives, χ1 and χ2, are just related to the entropy and
heat capacity, respectively. Higher-order χn (n ≥2) can
be interpreted as entropy fluctuations of different orders.
The numerical results of χn from the first to sixth or-
ders calculated in the 2+1 flavor LEFT-fRG framework
are presented in the supplement. We found that the en-
tropy fluctuations increase and oscillate near the chiral
crossover, and the strength and amplitude of the oscilla-
tion increase with the order of fluctuations or the value
of baryon chemical potential.
The temperature fluctuations in Eq. (8) can be refor-
mulated in terms of χn, defined in Eq. (11).
For the
lowest-order cumulants, we obtain
c2 = 1

c3 = −χ3
