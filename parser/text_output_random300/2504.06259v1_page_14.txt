plitude of the drives to generate the necessary entangle-
ment at that detuning. In practice, this involves finding
the ratio ζbr such that the coherence of the gate is max-
imized. We utilize the microwave Ramsey-echo sequence
described in Fig. 6 to find the appropriate ζbr for each
ion. Once that ratio has been selected per ion, we then
sit at the desired detuning per MS gate pair and apply an
overall scaling factor, κ for the the red and blue ampli-
tudes to generate equal zero and two bright populations,

pulse amplitude scaling that is applied uniformly to both
IA tones (note, that the global beam tone is used to then
scale down to arbitrary θ). The coarse and fine sweeps
are measured sequentially with the scaling updated be-
tween scans, hence the scaling of the fine scan very near

to find the final amplitude scaling.
Lastly, we compensate for any residual light shifts by
applying a frame rotation as described in Section IV. Be-
ginning in the |00⟩state a sequence of M × MS(π/M)
gates of duration τ is applied to a pair of ions to find
the value of the frame rotation ϕf,i(τ) that maximizes
the |11⟩population. Figure 14d shows an example of a
frame rotation calibration for a MS(π/2) (M=2). Two
MS gates are applied sequentially and the populations
are recorded versus the frame rotation angle. The peak
of a Gaussian fit specifies the calibrated frame rotation,
ϕf,i(τ) for an MS(π/2). The process is repeated for all
ion pairs.
We also perform the same measurement at
M=32, and then linearly interpolate between the two cal-
ibrations to determine the necessary ϕf,i(τ) for any θ.
Two-qubit gate fidelities, as described in Section III are
characterized by both a spin probability scan and parity
scans. Figure 15a a parity measurement with populations
in Fig. 15b yielding a fidelity of 0.972+0.003

APPENDIX B: FIDELITIES FOR VARIOUS
CHAIN LENGTHS
The following tables were compiled using population
measurement only fidelity estimations as described in
Ref. [25, 40]. Ion ordering sets the center of the chain
(or left-center in an even chain) to be q0, see Fig. 16.
The radial motional sideband mode indexing presented
here is different than the mode indexing used in Fig. 1
and the fourth-order light shift discussion. Here, the in-
dex starts with the highest frequency mode (the center
of mass mode) within the radial manifold of interest and
works towards the lowest frequency. For example, in a
