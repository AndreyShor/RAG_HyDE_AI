Arbitrary Input or Output Size
Consider boxes with binary inputs, but with outputs taken from arbitrary
ﬁnite sets. Let dx denote the number of inputs and da the number of outputs
on Alice’s side, similarly dy denotes the number of inputs and db the number
of outputs on Bob’s side. Such boxes correspond to deﬁnition 1 but where x ∈
{0, . . . , dx−1}, y ∈{0, . . . , dy−1}, a ∈{0, . . . , da−1} and b ∈{0, . . . , db−1}.
We will refer to these as generalized boxes.
7.1.1
d-Output Boxes
The class of generalized boxes with dx = dy = 2 form a polytope P described
by Barrett et al. [1]. It’s dimension is 4dadb −2da −2db. So if da = db = d,
the dimension is 4d2 −4d and when d = 2 we ﬁnd the dimension of the
non-signalling polytope of section 2.
They also found that the non-local vertices of this polytope are all equiv-
alent under reversible local operations. A result analogous to the fact that
all non-local vertices of the two-input two-output polytope are equivalent to
the PR-box.
Theorem 17. Every non-local vertex of P is equivalent under reversible local
operations to
P(a, b|x, y) =

for some k ∈{2, . . . , min{da, db}} where x, y ∈{0, 1} and a, b ∈{0, . . . , k −
1}.
Actually, for every k, the box described above is a representative of an
equivalence class of non-local vertices.
When da = db = k = d, this box violates the d-dimensional generalization
of the CHSH inequality [11] up to it’s algebraic maximum. We will refer to
such boxes as d-output boxes.
7.1.2
d-Input Boxes
Jones and Masanes [15] characterized the set of generalized boxes for da =
db = 2 and arbitrary dx and dy. Every class of non-local vertices for a given dx
and dy is represented by a box parameterized by two integers gx ∈{2, . . . , dx}
