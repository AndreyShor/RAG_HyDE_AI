S0 independent of σ, which it turns out is the fluid viscosity. The Burgers-Zeldovich
fluid model arises from the Hopf-Cole transformation,
vσ(x, t) = −σ2∇ln (uσ(x, t)),

We assume T0 > 0 and

conservation of probability. The link is the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, in the
limiting case as σ →0 of

As in our treatment of the original Schr¨odinger equation, we need the existence of our
diffeomorphism, Dt, which, to avoid confusion with convected derivative D
dt, we denote
by Φt : Rd →Rd, where in the limit as σ →0, (∗) reads

t ∈(0, T) for sufficiently small T.
We need some elementary results from classical mechanics. If ˜S(y) is defined as
