Now we integrate out σ0. Computing ∂σ0Weff = 0 gives
t + 3 log(eσ1 −σ0) −3 log(σ0) = 0.
(2.51)
Solving the equation above for σ0 we obtain
σ0 =
1
1 + e−t
3 eσ1 =: f(e−t)eσ1.
(2.52)
This goes to zero as ζ →−∞, consistent with the fact that the determinantal U(1) gets Higgsed
at this point. Away from this limit we get a potential for eσ1, eσ2, lifting the Coulomb branch. To
analyse this in more detail we reinsert σ0 back into (2.50).
Weff(eσ1, eσ2) =feσ1 [t + 3 log(eσ1(1 −f)) −3 log(feσ1)]
−3eσ1 log(eσ1(1 −f)) + 3(eσ1 + eσ2) log(−eσ1 −eσ2) −3eσ2 log(eσ2).
(2.53)
The term in the brackets vanishes by (2.52). There is still a Coulomb branch at the critical locus
of Weff(eσ1, eσ2). Using log(−x) = log(−1) + log(x) = iπ + log(x) we compute
∂eσ1Weff(eσ1, eσ2) =3iπ −3 log(eσ1(1 −f)) + 3 log(eσ1 + eσ2),
∂eσ2Weff(eσ1, eσ2) =3iπ −3 log(eσ2) + 3 log(eσ1 + eσ2).
(2.54)
Taking the difference of the two equations, we get a condition we can solve for eσ2:
−3 log(eσ1(1 −f)) + 3 log eσ2 = 0
→
f
σ2 = (1 −f)eσ1.
(2.55)
Inserting this back into the equations for the critical locus we get
(2 −f)3
(1 −f)3 = −1.
(2.56)
Note that
1 −f = e−t
2 f,
2 −f = (1 + 2e−t
3 )f
→
(2 −f)3
(1 −f)3 = et(1 + 2e−t
3 )3.
(2.57)
Solving this leads to the three Coulomb branches we have identified at the phase boundary and
no further singularities. So the Coulomb branch in the strongly coupled phase is lifted for finite
negative ζ but gets pushed to ζ →−∞.

Tentative conclusion for the ζ ≪0-phase
Let us summarise the partial results for the strongly coupled phase X at ζ < 0. As long as ζ is large
and negative, the low energy theory is a hybrid-model with a base P2 and a Landau-Ginzburg-type
fibre with a cubic potential. Since we have an unbroken (U(1) × U(1)) ⋊Z3-symmetry this is an
interacting gauge theory. Quantum effects related to the broken symmetry imply that at finite
negative values of ζ the gauge degrees of freedom decouple. The chiral fields are massless but
interact via a cubic superpotential. The couplings are governed by a rank three tensor Aijk(⟨p⟩)
depending on the base coordinates of the fibration. It seems natural to suspect that the physics
of the theory changes when some of the couplings vanish. This information is determined by the
