Figure 8: The predicted δCP versus mββ for
IH in the case of A1 with infinite M3 by
putting the constraint the positive cosmolog-
ical baryon number YB > 0 for the case of
M1 > M2.
As for the case of M3 = ∞, we find that only the inverted hierarchy (IH) is realized. In
Fig. 7, we show the prediction of δCP and mββ for M3 = ∞. We see the broad region for the
δCP while mββ ≃49meV. In Fig. 8, we show also the predictions of δCP and mββ imposing the
positive baryon asymmetry in the universe. From both figures, we see the positive cosmological
baryon asymmetry, YB > 0, in the present universe implies that the first family right-handed
neutrino is heavier than the second one, M1 > M2.
We also comment that the almost same results are obtained in the other two cases, A2, A3
even in the case of two right-handed neutrinos.

Conclusions
We have constructed two zeros textures of the down-type quark mass matrices based on the
T 2/Z3 orbifold in the six dimensional space-time. We have realized a diagonal mass matrix
for the up-quark mass matrices, taking the size L of compactification a bit larger than the
fundamental cut-off scale M∗(LM∗> 30 [1]). Here, we have put all 10i on the separate three
fixed points in the extra two dimensions. All 5∗
i are living in the bulk. To generate zeros in
mass matrices for the down-type quarks, we have imposed a flavor discrete symmetry Z2. Here,
all of them have four zeros in the textures. All elements are real, since we have assumed the
CP invariance at the fundamental level.
We have introduced two vevs of the complex scalar bosons η and η′ to break the CP- and
Z2 symmetries, which makes two zeros textures of the down-type quark mass matrices. Then,
