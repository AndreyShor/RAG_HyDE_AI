Clearly, (Wk×ℓ

CB′ obeys the conditions following from complex conjugating (2.15).
Our goal now is to study the space of self-dual configurations with Q = r/N in the neighbor-
hood of the constant-F solution of (2.5), parameterized by the general fluctuations of (2.12).
To this end, we impose the self-duality condition on (2.12) as well as the background gauge
condition, ensuring that the fluctuations are orthogonal to small gauge transformations:
D( ¯A)µAµ = 0,
(2.16)
where D( ¯A) is the adjoint-representation covariant derivative in the ¯Aµ background. The self-
duality condition is equivalent (see e.g. [30]) to imposing the constraint on the field strength
of (2.12):
¯σµνFµν = 0 .
(2.17)
where13 ¯σµν =
1
2(¯σµσν −¯σνσµ).
To write the self-duality condition, we use quaternionic
notation: for every four-vector Vµ, we define the quaternions V ≡σµVµ and ¯V ≡¯σµVµ. Then,
we compute the SU(N) field strength of (2.12), use the gauge condition (2.16), and obtain
the self-duality conditions for each of the k × k, ℓ× ℓand k × ℓblocks of the SU(N) matrix
in (2.12) as follows:14

Above, we introduced a parameter λ multiplying the nonlinear terms, since our goal is to solve
these equations using an expansion around the linearized equations (the ones with λ = 0).

13Here, σµ ≡(i⃗σ, 1), ¯σµ ≡(−i⃗σ, 1), ⃗σ are the Pauli matrices which determine the µ = 1, 2, 3 components of
the four-vectors σµ, ¯σµ.
14The definition of quaternions was already given in the paragraph after (2.17).
We warn the reader,
temporarily not denoting explicitly that these are k × ℓmatrices, to keep in mind the difference between the
quaternions, W ≡Wµσµ, ¯
W = ¯σµWµ, and the four-vector Wµ and, furthermore, note that W† = σµW†
µ and
¯
W† = ¯σµW†
µ. Here and below, the terms that have sums over µ should be multiplied by unit quaternion σ4,
which we have omitted for brevity.
