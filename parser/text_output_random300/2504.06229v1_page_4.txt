and ∆˜βk,k′ = ∆βl,l′ −(λk + λk′).
The JSSA of Eqs (8) and (9) is symmetric, i.e. it is
invariant under the change of indices k ↔k′. Using this
property, the solution to Equation (7) can be simplified
through a full nonlinear supermode basis ˆC, given by
ˆCm = PN
k=1 Υ†
m,k(z) ˆBk, where Υ(z) is an unitary ma-
trix which diagonalizes f(z) by a congruence transforma-
tion – the Autonne-Takagi transformation– obtaining a
real diagonal matrix with non-negative entries Λ(z) [43].
Equation (7) in terms of nonlinear supermodes is thus
simply given by
ˆCm(z) = cosh[rm(z)] ˆCm(0) + sinh[rm(z)] ˆC†
m(0),
(10)
with m = 1, . . . , N, and where rm(z) = Γ(z)Λm,m(z) are
the downconversion gains at a propagation distance z.
Each spatio-spectral nonlinear supermode thus appears
as a broadband non-local single-mode squeezed state.
In terms of the individual spatio-spectral modes, the
solution to the nonlinear system is

This is one of the main results of our contribution: the
full diagonalization of the system yields the general solu-
tion of the system in spatio-spectral modes j (localized,
single band) given by Equation (11). Indeed, the solution
for any pump configuration and geometry of the lattice
is obtained calculating Υk,m(z) and rm(z) from Equa-
tion (8). Importantly, the modes j can be distributed in
a quantum network. On the other hand, the full non-
linear supermode basis m (delocalized, broadband) with
solution given by Equation (10) is not experimentally
practical as the local oscillator in a homodyne measure-
ment stage should be shaped in a specific spatio-spectral
nonlinear supermode and they can not be distributed in
a quantum network. In general, Equation (8) can not be
decoupled in spatial and spectral parts as the sinus car-
dinal couples spectral and spatial modes [18]. Neverthe-
less, the system can be decoupled in specific cases when
the sinus cardinal can be approximated by a separable
function like a Gaussian function [44, 45]. Moreover, the
effect of propagation losses can be easily included in our
model [46].
In the following we illustrate this framework using a
relevant example. We analyze the following case: a pump
with a flat spatial distribution such that ηj = |η|eiϕ and
ηk,k′ = |η|δk,k′eiϕ, spectrally Gaussian
Ω(ωs + ωi) = ((2π)1/2∆p)−1/2e
−
(ωh−(ωs+ωi))2

,
and narrowband –its linewidth (full width half maxi-
mum) in intensity 2
p
2 ln(2)∆p much lower than the
frexel resolution ∆F .
This pump distribution is cou-
pled in each waveguide producing pairs of photons spec-
trally symmetric with respect to ωh/2.
We set |η| =
1/
√
N and for simplicity we choose ϕ = −π/2 –this is
a global phase that will just change the squeezing an-
gle such that ˜Lk,k′(z) = −iδk,k′ e−2iλkz/
√
N.
In type
0 (or I) downconversion the wavevector phase-mismatch
can be approximated at first order in frequency by
∆β(ωs, ωi) ≈∆β(ωh/2, ωh/2) + γ(ωh −ωs + ωi) with
γ = (∂β/∂ω|ωh−∂β/∂ω|ω(s/i)) [26]. The phase mismatch
at the degenerate frequency can be phasematched by, for
instance, quasi-phasematching and suitable temperature
setting.
Thus, for a narrowband pump Ω(ωs + ωi) =
δ(ωh −ωs −ωi) and ˜Ll,l′(z) = δL+1−l,l′ in the bandwidth
of interest. The joint spatio-spectral distribution is thus
Lk,k′(z) = −ig√phδk,k′δL+1−l,l′ e−2iλkz where ph is here
the pump power per waveguide ph ≡Ph/N, such that the
spatial modes are decoupled –squeezed– and the spectral
modes are coupled two by two –entangled–. Equation (2)
can then be written as
d ˆBk
dz = g√ph e−2iλkz ˆB†

(12)
with k ≡k(k, l) and k′ ≡k′(k, L + 1 −l). This is the
equation of a two-mode squeezer between modes k and
k′ with gain G ≡rkz = [(g√ph)2 −λ2
k]1/2z. In the indi-
vidual mode basis, the solution of Equation (12) for each
value of l is given by

and where we have taken l ≡s (signal) and L + 1 −l ≡i
(idler). Note that the different shape of Equations (11)
and (13)-(14) is related to the change of basis back to the
individual-mode single-band basis from a fully-decoupled
and from a partially-decoupled supermode basis, respec-
tively.
The solution of Equations (13)-(14) showing only en-
tanglement between symmetric frexels around the cen-
tral frequency is the limit of a pump spectrally Gaussian
when its linewidth is much lower than the frexel reso-
lution [47]. A broader pump would include terms mod-
ulated by the Gaussian spectral distribution entangling
symmetric frexels around l±1, l±2, etc; generating corre-
lations mainly between the central frexels with a strength
that follows a Gaussian distribution [15, 16].
