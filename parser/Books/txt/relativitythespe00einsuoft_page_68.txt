50      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
latter  effect  manifests  itself  in  a  slight  displacement 
of  the  spectral  lines  of  the  light  transmitted  to  us  from 
a  fixed  star,  as  compared  with  the  position  of  the  same 
spectral  lines  when  they  are  produced  by  a  terrestrial 
source  of  light  (Doppler  principle).  The  experimental 
arguments  in  favour  of  the  Maxwell-Lorentz  theory, 
which  are  at  the  same  time  arguments  in  favour  of  the 
theory  of  relativity,  are  too  numerous  to  be  set  forth 
here.  In  reality  they  limit  the  theoretical  possibilities 
to  such  an  extent,  that  no  other  theory  than  that  of 
Maxwell  and  Lorentz  has  been  able  to  hold  its  own  when 
tested  by  experience. 
But  there  are  two  classes  of  experimental  facts 
hitherto  obtained  which  can  be  represented  in  the 
Maxwell-Lorentz  theory  only  by  the  introduction  of  an 
auxiliary  hypothesis,  which  in  itself — i.e.  without 
making  use  of  the  theory  of  relativity — appears  ex 
traneous. 
It  is  known  that  cathode  rays  and  the  so-called 
/2-rays  emitted  by  radioactive  substances  consist  of 
negatively  electrified  particles  (electrons)  of  very  small 
inertia  and  large  velocity.  By  examining  the  deflection 
of  these  rays  under  the  influence  of  electric  and  magnetic 
fields,  we  can  study  the  law  of  motion  of  these  particles 
very  exactly. 
In  the  theoretical  treatment  of  these  electrons,  we  are 
faced  with  the  difficulty  that  electrodynamic  theory  of 
itself  is  unable  to  give  an  account  of  their  nature.  For 
since  electrical  masses  of  one  sign  repel  each  other,  the 
negative  electrical  masses  constituting  the  electron  would 
necessarily  be  scattered  under  the  influence  of  their 
mutual  repulsions,  unless  there  are  forces  of  another 
kind  operating  between  them,  the  nature  of  which  has
