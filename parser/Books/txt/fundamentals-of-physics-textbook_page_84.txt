In Fig. 3-31, a cube of edge
length a sits with one corner at the ori-
gin of an xyz coordinate system. A
body diagonal is a line that extends
from one corner to another through
the center. In unit-vector notation,
what is the body diagonal that extends
from the corner at (a) coordinates (0,
0, 0), (b) coordinates (a, 0, 0), (c) coor-
dinates (0, a, 0), and (d) coordinates (a, a, 0)? (e) Determine the

An explorer is caught in a whiteout (in which the
snowfall is so thick that the ground cannot be distinguished from
the sky) while returning to base camp. He was supposed to travel
due north for 5.6 km, but when the snow clears, he discovers that
he actually traveled 7.8 km at 50° north of due east. (a) How far
and (b) in what direction must he now travel to reach base camp?

An ant, crazed by the Sun on a hot Texas afternoon, darts
over an xy plane scratched in the dirt. The x and y components of
four consecutive darts are the following, all in centimeters: (30.0,
40.0), (bx, $70.0), ($20.0, cy), ($80.0, $70.0). The overall displace-
ment of the four darts has the xy components ($140, $20.0).What
are (a) bx and (b) cy? What are the (c) magnitude and (d) angle
(relative to the positive direction of the x axis) of the overall
displacement?

Two beetles run across flat sand, starting at the same point.
Beetle 1 runs 0.50 m due east, then 0.80 m at 30° north of due east.
Beetle 2 also makes two runs; the first is 1.6 m at 40° east of due
north. What must be (a) the magnitude and (b) the direction of its
second run if it is to end up at the new location of beetle 1?

Typical backyard ants often create a network of
chemical trails for guidance. Extending outward from the nest, a
trail branches (bifurcates) repeatedly, with 60° between the
branches. If a roaming ant chances upon a trail, it can tell the
way to the nest at any branch point: If it is moving away from
the nest, it has two choices of path requiring a small turn in
its travel direction, either 30° leftward or 30° rightward. If
it is moving toward the nest, it has only one such choice.
Figure 3-29 shows a typical ant trail, with lettered straight sec-
tions of 2.0 cm length and symmetric bifurcation of 60°. Path v is
parallel to the y axis. What are the (a) magnitude and (b) angle
(relative to the positive direction of the superimposed x axis) of
