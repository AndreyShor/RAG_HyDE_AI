trical potential energy. The general principle is that the change in
the energy is the force times the distance that the force is pushed,
and that this is a change in energy in general:

We will return to many of these other kinds of energy as we con-
tinue the course.
The principle of the conservation of energy is very useful for de-
ducing what will happen in a number of circumstances. In high
school we learned a lot of laws about pulleys and levers used in dif-
ferent ways. We can now see that these “laws” are all the same thing,
and that we did not have to memorize 75 rules to ﬁgure it out. A
simple example is a smooth inclined plane which is, happily, a
three-four-ﬁve triangle (Fig. 4-3). We hang a one-pound weight on
the inclined plane with a pulley, and on the other side of the pulley,
a weight W. We want to know how heavy W must be to balance the
one pound on the plane. How can we ﬁgure that out? If we say it
is just balanced, it is reversible and so can move up and down, and
we can consider the following situation. In the initial circumstance,
(a), the one-pound weight is at the bottom and weight W is at the
top. When W has slipped down in a reversible way, we have a one-
pound weight at the top and the weight W the slant distance, (b),
or ﬁve feet, from the plane in which it was before. We lifted the one-
pound weight only three feet and we lowered W pounds by ﬁve feet.
