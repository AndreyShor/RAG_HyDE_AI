CHAPTER 10
ROTATION
Work and Rotational Kinetic Energy
As we discussed in Chapter 7, when a force F causes a rigid body of mass m to ac-
celerate along a coordinate axis, the force does work W on the body. Thus, the
body’s kinetic energy 
can change. Suppose it is the only energy of the

After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
10.29 Calculate the work done by a torque acting on a rotat-
ing body by integrating the torque with respect to the an-
gle of rotation.
10.30 Apply the work–kinetic energy theorem to relate the
work done by a torque to the resulting change in the rota-
tional kinetic energy of the body.
10.31 Calculate the work done by a constant torque by relat-
ing the work to the angle through which the body rotates.
10.32 Calculate the power of a torque by finding the rate at
which work is done.
10.33 Calculate the power of a torque at any given instant by
relating it to the torque and the angular velocity at that instant.

body that changes.Then we relate the change "K in kinetic energy to the work W
with the work–kinetic energy theorem (Eq. 7-10), writing
(work–kinetic energy theorem).
(10-49)
For motion confined to an x axis, we can calculate the work with Eq. 7-32,
(work, one-dimensional motion).
(10-50)
This reduces to W ! Fd when F is constant and the body’s displacement is d.
The rate at which the work is done is the power, which we can find with Eqs. 7-43
and 7-48,
(power, one-dimensional motion).
(10-51)
Now let us consider a rotational situation that is similar. When a torque
accelerates a rigid body in rotation about a fixed axis, the torque does work W
on the body. Therefore, the body’s rotational kinetic energy 
can
change. Suppose that it is the only energy of the body that changes. Then we
can still relate the change "K in kinetic energy to the work W with the
work–kinetic energy theorem, except now the kinetic energy is a rotational 
kinetic energy:
(work–kinetic energy theorem).
(10-52)
Here, I is the rotational inertia of the body about the fixed axis and vi and vf are
the angular speeds of the body before and after the work is done.
