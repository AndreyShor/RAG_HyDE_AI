Checkpoint 1
The figure shows a circular path taken by a particle.
If the instantaneous velocity of the particle is 
, through which quadrant is the par-
ticle moving at that instant if it is traveling (a) clockwise
and (b) counterclockwise around the circle? For both
cases, draw 
on the figure.

CHAPTER 4
MOTION IN TWO AND THREE DIMENSIONS
The direction of the instantaneous velocity 
of a particle is always tangent to the
particle’s path at the particle’s position.
v
:
The result is the same in three dimensions:
is always tangent to the particle’s path.
To write Eq. 4-10 in unit-vector form, we substitute for 
from Eq. 4-1:
This equation can be simplified somewhat by writing it as
(4-11)
where the scalar components of 
are
(4-12)
For example, dx/dt is the scalar component of 
along the x axis.Thus, we can find
the scalar components of 
by differentiating the scalar components of .
Figure 4-4 shows a velocity vector 
and its scalar x and y components. Note
that 
is tangent to the particle’s path at the particle’s position. Caution: When a
position vector is drawn, as in Figs. 4-1 through 4-3, it is an arrow that extends
from one point (a “here”) to another point (a “there”). However, when a velocity
vector is drawn, as in Fig. 4-4, it does not extend from one point to another.
Rather, it shows the instantaneous direction of travel of a particle at the tail, and
its length (representing the velocity magnitude) can be drawn to any scale.
