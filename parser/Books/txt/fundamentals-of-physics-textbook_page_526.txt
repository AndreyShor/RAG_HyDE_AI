CHAPTER 17
WAVES—II
Detector Moving, Source Stationary
In Fig. 17-19, a detector D (represented by an ear) is moving at speed vD toward
a stationary source S that emits spherical wavefronts, of wavelength l and
frequency f, moving at the speed v of sound in air.The wavefronts are drawn one
wavelength apart. The frequency detected by detector D is the rate at which D
intercepts wavefronts (or individual wavelengths). If D were stationary, that rate
would be f, but since D is moving into the wavefronts, the rate of interception is
greater, and thus the detected frequency f, is greater than f.
Let us for the moment consider the situation in which D is stationary
(Fig. 17-20). In time t, the wavefronts move to the right a distance vt. The num-
ber of wavelengths in that distance vt is the number of wavelengths intercepted
by D in time t, and that number is vt/l. The rate at which D intercepts wave-
lengths, which is the frequency f detected by D, is
(17-48)
In this situation, with D stationary, there is no Doppler effect—the frequency
detected by D is the frequency emitted by S.
Now let us again consider the situation in which D moves in the direction
opposite the wavefront velocity (Fig. 17-21). In time t, the wavefronts move to
the right a distance vt as previously, but now D moves to the left a distance vDt.
Thus, in this time t, the distance moved by the wavefronts relative to D is vt "
vDt. The number of wavelengths in this relative distance vt " vDt is the number
of wavelengths intercepted by D in time t and is (vt " vDt)/l. The rate at which
D intercepts wavelengths in this situation is the frequency f,, given by
.
(17-49)
From Eq. 17-48, we have l # v/f.Then Eq. 17-49 becomes
.
(17-50)
Note that in Eq. 17-50, f, > f unless vD # 0 (the detector is stationary).
Similarly, we can find the frequency detected by D if D moves away from
the source. In this situation, the wavefronts move a distance vt $ vDt relative to
D in time t, and f, is given by
.
(17-51)
In Eq. 17-51, f, < f unless vD # 0.We can summarize Eqs. 17-50 and 17-51 with
(detector moving, source stationary).

Figure 17-19 A stationary source of
sound S emits spherical wavefronts,
shown one wavelength apart, that
expand outward at speed v. A sound
detector D, represented by an ear,
moves with velocity 
toward the
source. The detector senses a higher
frequency because of its motion.
