drifting downward in the wire (the actual case) or positive charges drifting up-
ward. The direction of the deflecting force on the wire is the same. We are safe
then in dealing with a current of positive charge, as we usually do in dealing with
circuits.
Find the Force. Consider a length L of the wire in Fig. 28-15.All the conduc-
tion electrons in this section of wire will drift past plane xx in Fig. 28-15 in a time
t ! L/vd.Thus, in that time a charge given by
will pass through that plane. Substituting this into Eq. 28-3 yields
or
FB ! iLB.
(28-25)
Note that this equation gives the magnetic force that acts on a length L of straight
wire carrying a current i and immersed in a uniform magnetic field 
that is per-
pendicular to the wire.
If the magnetic field is not perpendicular to the wire, as in Fig. 28-16, the
magnetic force is given by a generalization of Eq. 28-25:
(force on a current).
(28-26)
Here 
is a length vector that has magnitude L and is directed along the wire
segment in the direction of the (conventional) current.The force magnitude FB is
FB ! iLB sin f,
(28-27)
where f is the angle between the directions of 
and 
. The direction of 
is
that of the cross product 
because we take current i to be a positive quan-
tity. Equation 28-26 tells us that 
is always perpendicular to the plane defined
by vectors 
and , as indicated in Fig. 28-16.
Equation 28-26 is equivalent to Eq. 28-2 in that either can be taken as the
defining equation for 
. In practice, we define 
from Eq. 28-26 because it is
much easier to measure the magnetic force acting on a wire than that on a single
moving charge.
Crooked Wire. If a wire is not straight or the field is not uniform, we can
imagine the wire broken up into small straight segments and apply Eq. 28-26 to
each segment. The force on the wire as a whole is then the vector sum of all the
forces on the segments that make it up. In the differential limit, we can write
(28-28)
and we can find the resultant force on any given arrangement of currents by
integrating Eq. 28-28 over that arrangement.
In using Eq. 28-28, bear in mind that there is no such thing as an isolated
current-carrying wire segment of length dL.There must always be a way to intro-
duce the current into the segment at one end and take it out at the other end.
