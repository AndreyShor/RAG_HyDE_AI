the orbit size. In this statement the period is the time interval it
takes a planet to go completely around its orbit, and the size is mea-
sured by the length of the greatest diameter of the elliptical orbit,
technically known as the major axis. More simply, if the planets
went in circles, as they nearly do, the time required to go around
the circle would be proportional to the 3/2 power of the diameter
(or radius). Thus Kepler’s three laws are:
I. Each planet moves around the sun in an ellipse, with the sun
at one focus.
II. The radius vector from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal
areas in equal intervals of time.
III. The squares of the periods of any two planets are proportional
to the cubes of the semimajor axes of their respective orbits:
T μ a3/2.
Development of dynamics
While Kepler was discovering these laws, Galileo was studying the
laws of motion. The problem was, what makes the planets go
around? (In those days, one of the theories proposed was that the
planets went around because behind them were invisible angels,
beating their wings and driving the planets forward. You will see
that this theory is now modiﬁed! It turns out that in order to keep
the planets going around, the invisible angels must ﬂy in a different
