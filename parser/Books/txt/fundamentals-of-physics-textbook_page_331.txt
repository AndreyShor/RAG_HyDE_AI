11.18 Identify that the fixed point about which an angular 
momentum is calculated must always be specified.
11.19 Calculate the angular momentum of a particle by taking
the cross product of the particle’s position vector and its

Key Ideas
Angular Momentum
Recall that the concept of linear momentum 
and the principle of conservation
of linear momentum are extremely powerful tools. They allow us to predict
the outcome of, say, a collision of two cars without knowing the details of the col-
lision. Here we begin a discussion of the angular counterpart of 
, winding up in
Module 11-8 with the angular counterpart of the conservation principle, which
can lead to beautiful (almost magical) feats in ballet, fancy diving, ice skating, and
many other activities.
Figure 11-12 shows a particle of mass m with linear momentum 
as
it passes through point A in an xy plane. The angular momentum
of this parti-
cle with respect to the origin O is a vector quantity defined as
(angular momentum defined),
(11-18)
where 
is the position vector of the particle with respect to O. As the particle
moves relative to O in the direction of its momentum 
, position vector
rotates around O. Note carefully that to have angular momentum about O, the
particle does not itself have to rotate around O.Comparison of Eqs.11-14 and 11-18
shows that angular momentum bears the same relation to linear momentum that
torque does to force. The SI unit of angular momentum is the kilogram-
meter-squared per second (kg)m2/s), equivalent to the joule-second (J)s).
Direction. To find the direction of the angular momentum vector
in Fig. 11-
12, we slide the vector 
until its tail is at the origin O.Then we use the right-hand
rule for vector products, sweeping the fingers from 
into 
. The outstretched
thumb then shows that the direction of
is in the positive direction of the z axis in
Fig.11-12.This positive direction is consistent with the counterclockwise rotation of
position vector 
about the z axis, as the particle moves. (A negative direction of
would be consistent with a clockwise rotation of 
about the z axis.)
Magnitude. To find the magnitude of
, we use the general result of Eq. 3-27
to write
(11-19)
where f is the smaller angle between 
and 
when these two vectors are tail
