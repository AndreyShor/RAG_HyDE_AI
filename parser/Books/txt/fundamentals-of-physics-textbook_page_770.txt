8.00 mF) connected to a 12.0 V battery.When switch S is closed so as
to connect uncharged capacitor 4 (C4
6.00 mF), (a) how much
charge passes through point P from the battery and (b) how much
charge shows up on capacitor 4? (c) Explain the discrepancy in
those two results.
62
Two air-filled, parallel-plate capacitors are to be connected to a
10 V battery, first individually, then in series, and then in parallel. In
those arrangements, the energy stored in the capacitors turns out to
be, listed least to greatest: 75 mJ, 100 mJ, 300 mJ, and 400 mJ. Of the
two capacitors, what is the (a) smaller and (b) greater capacitance?
63
Two parallel-plate capacitors, 6.0 mF each, are connected
in series to a 10 V battery. One of the capacitors is then squeezed
so that its plate separation is halved. Because of the squeezing,
(a) how much additional charge is transferred to the capacitors by
the battery and (b) what is the increase in the total charge stored
on the capacitors (the charge on the positive plate of one capacitor
plus the charge on the positive plate of the other capacitor)?

stored on the capacitors and (b) the
charge on capacitor 4?
65
In Fig. 25-56, the parallel-plate
capacitor of plate area 2.00
10#2 m2
is filled with two dielectric slabs, each
with thickness 2.00 mm. One slab has di-
electric constant 3.00, and the other,
4.00. How much charge does the 7.00 V
battery store on the capacitor?
66
A cylindrical capacitor has radii a
and b as in Fig. 25-6. Show that half the
stored electric potential energy lies
within a cylinder whose radius is
67
A capacitor of capacitance C1 !
6.00 mF is connected in series with a capacitor of capacitance C2 !
4.00 mF, and a potential difference of 200 V is applied across the
pair. (a) Calculate the equivalent capacitance.What are (b) charge
q1 and (c) potential difference V1 on capacitor 1 and (d) q2 and (e)
V2 on capacitor 2?
68
Repeat Problem 67 for the same two capacitors but with them
now connected in parallel.
69
A certain capacitor is charged to a potential difference V. If
you wish to increase its stored energy by 10%, by what percentage
should you increase V?
70
A slab of copper of thickness
b ! 2.00 mm is thrust into a parallel-
plate capacitor of plate area A ! 2.40
cm2 and plate separation d ! 5.00
mm, as shown in Fig. 25-57; the slab is
exactly halfway between the plates.
(a) What is the capacitance after the
slab is introduced? (b) If a charge 
q ! 3.40 mC is maintained on the
plates, what is the ratio of the stored energy before to that after the
slab is inserted? (c) How much work is done on the slab as it is in-
serted? (d) Is the slab sucked in or must it be pushed in?

Repeat Problem 70, assuming that a potential difference V !
85.0 V, rather than the charge, is held constant.
72
A potential difference of 300 V is applied to a series
connection of two capacitors of capacitances C1 ! 2.00 mF and
C2 ! 8.00 mF. What are (a) charge q1 and (b) potential difference
V1 on capacitor 1 and (c) q2 and (d) V2 on capacitor 2? The charged
capacitors are then disconnected from each other and from the
battery. Then the capacitors are reconnected with plates of the
same signs wired together (the battery is not used). What now are
(e) q1, (f) V1, (g) q2, and (h) V2? Suppose, instead, the capacitors
charged in part (a) are reconnected with plates of opposite signs
wired together.What now are (i) q1, (j) V1, (k) q2, and (l) V2?
73
Figure 25-58 shows a four-
capacitor arrangement that is con-
nected to a larger circuit at points A
and B. The capacitances are C1 !
10 mF and C2 ! C3 ! C4 ! 20 mF.
The charge on capacitor 1 is 30 mC.
What is the magnitude of the poten-
tial difference VA # VB?
74
You have two plates of copper, a sheet of mica (thickness !
0.10 mm, k ! 5.4), a sheet of glass (thickness ! 2.0 mm, k ! 7.0),
and a slab of paraffin (thickness ! 1.0 cm, k ! 2.0). To make a
parallel-plate capacitor with the largest C, which sheet should you
place between the copper plates?
75
A capacitor of unknown capacitance C is charged to 100 V and
connected across an initially uncharged 60 mF capacitor. If the final
potential difference across the 60 mF capacitor is 40 V,what is C?
76
A 10 V battery is connected to a series of n capacitors, each of
capacitance 2.0 mF. If the total stored energy is 25 mJ, what is n?
77
In Fig. 25-59, two parallel-
plate capacitors A and B are con-
nected in parallel across a 600 V
battery. Each plate has area 80.0 cm2;
the plate separations are 3.00 mm.
Capacitor A is filled with air; capaci-
tor B is filled with a dielectric of dielectric constant k
2.60.
Find the magnitude of the electric field within (a) the dielectric of
capacitor B and (b) the air of capacitor A.What are the free charge
densities s on the higher-potential plate of (c) capacitor A and
(d) capacitor B? (e) What is the induced charge density s- on the
top surface of the dielectric?
78
You have many 2.0 mF capacitors, each capable of with-
standing 200 V without undergoing electrical breakdown (in which
they conduct charge instead of storing it). How would you assem-
ble a combination having an equivalent capacitance of (a) 0.40 mF
and (b) 1.2 mF, each combination capable of withstanding 1000 V?
79
A parallel-plate capacitor has charge q and plate area A.
(a) By finding the work needed to increase the plate separation
from x to x % dx, determine the force between the plates. (Hint:
See Eq. 8-22.) (b) Then show that the force per unit area (the elec-
trostatic stress) acting on either plate is equal to the energy density
´0E2/2 between the plates.
80
A capacitor is charged until its stored energy is 4.00 J. A sec-
ond capacitor is then connected to it in parallel. (a) If the charge
distributes equally, what is the total energy stored in the electric
fields? (b) Where did the missing energy go?
