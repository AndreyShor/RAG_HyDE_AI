An ion source is producing 6Li ions, which have charge &e
and mass 9.99

difference of 10 kV and pass horizontally into a region in which
there is a uniform vertical magnetic field of magnitude B ! 1.2 T.

over the same region, that will allow the 6Li ions to pass through
undeflected.

At time t1, an electron is
sent along the positive direction of
an x axis, through both an electric
field 
and a magnetic field 
, with
directed parallel to the y axis.
Figure 28-33 gives the y component
Fnet,y of the net force on the electron
due to the two fields, as a function of
the electron’s speed v at time t1. The
scale of the velocity axis is set by
vs ! 100.0 m/s. The x and z compo-
nents of the net force are zero at t1.

tude E and (b)

A strip of copper 150 mm thick and 4.5 mm wide is placed in
a uniform magnetic field 
of magnitude 0.65 T, with 
perpendi-
cular to the strip. A current i ! 23 A is then sent through the strip
such that a Hall potential difference V appears across the width of
the strip. Calculate V. (The number of charge carriers per unit vol-
ume for copper is 8.47
