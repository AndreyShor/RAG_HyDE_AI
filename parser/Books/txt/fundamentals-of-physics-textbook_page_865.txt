29-1 MAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT
Proof of Equation 29-4
Figure 29-6, which is just like Fig. 29-1 except that now the wire is straight and of
infinite length, illustrates the task at hand. We seek the field 
at point P, a per-
pendicular distance R from the wire. The magnitude of the differential magnetic
field produced at P by the current-length element i
located a distance r from P
is given by Eq. 29-1:
The direction of 
in Fig. 29-6 is that of the vector  
—namely, directly
into the page.
Note that 
at point P has this same direction for all the current-length
elements into which the wire can be divided. Thus, we can find the magnitude of
the magnetic field produced at P by the current-length elements in the upper half
of the infinitely long wire by integrating dB in Eq. 29-1 from 0 to ..
Now consider a current-length element in the lower half of the wire, one that
is as far below P as 
is above P. By Eq. 29-3, the magnetic field produced at P
by this current-length element has the same magnitude and direction as that from
element i
in Fig. 29-6. Further, the magnetic field produced by the lower half
of the wire is exactly the same as that produced by the upper half. To find the
magnitude of the total magnetic field 
at P, we need only multiply the result of
our integration by 2.We get
(29-5)
The variables u, s, and r in this equation are not independent; Fig. 29-6 shows
that they are related by
and
With these substitutions and integral 19 in Appendix E, Eq. 29-5 becomes
(29-6)
as we wanted. Note that the magnetic field at P due to either the lower half or the
upper half of the infinite wire in Fig. 29-6 is half this value; that is,
(semi-infinite straight wire).

Magnetic Field Due to a Current in a Circular Arc of Wire
To find the magnetic field produced at a point by a current in a curved wire, we
would again use Eq. 29-1 to write the magnitude of the field produced by a single
current-length element, and we would again integrate to find the net field
produced by all the current-length elements. That integration can be difficult,
depending on the shape of the wire; it is fairly straightforward, however, when the
wire is a circular arc and the point is the center of curvature.
Figure 29-7a shows such an arc-shaped wire with central angle f, radius R,
and center C, carrying current i. At C, each current-length element i
of the
wire produces a magnetic field of magnitude dB given by Eq. 29-1. Moreover, as
Fig. 29-7b shows, no matter where the element is located on the wire, the angle u
