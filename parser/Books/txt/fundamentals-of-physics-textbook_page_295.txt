10-3 RELATING THE LINEAR AND ANGULAR VARIABLES
The Position
If a reference line on a rigid body rotates through an angle u, a point within the
body at a position r from the rotation axis moves a distance s along a circular arc,
where s is given by Eq. 10-1:
s ! ur
(radian measure).
(10-17)
This is the first of our linear–angular relations. Caution: The angle u here must be
measured in radians because Eq. 10-17 is itself the definition of angular measure
in radians.
The Speed
Differentiating Eq. 10-17 with respect to time—with r held constant—leads to
However, ds/dt is the linear speed (the magnitude of the linear velocity) of the
point in question, and du/dt is the angular speed v of the rotating body. So
v ! vr
(radian measure).
(10-18)
Caution: The angular speed v must be expressed in radian measure.
Equation 10-18 tells us that since all points within the rigid body have the
same angular speed v, points with greater radius r have greater linear speed v.
Figure 10-9a reminds us that the linear velocity is always tangent to the circular
path of the point in question.
If the angular speed v of the rigid body is constant, then Eq. 10-18 tells
us that the linear speed v of any point within it is also constant. Thus, each point
within the body undergoes uniform circular motion. The period of revolution T
for the motion of each point and for the rigid body itself is given by Eq. 4-35:
.
(10-19)
This equation tells us that the time for one revolution is the distance 2pr traveled
in one revolution divided by the speed at which that distance is traveled.
Substituting for v from Eq. 10-18 and canceling r, we find also that
(radian measure).
(10-20)
This equivalent equation says that the time for one revolution is the angular dis-
tance 2p rad traveled in one revolution divided by the angular speed (or rate) at
which that angle is traveled.
The Acceleration
Differentiating Eq. 10-18 with respect to time—again with r held constant—
leads to
(10-21)
Here we run up against a complication. In Eq. 10-21, dv/dt represents only the
part of the linear acceleration that is responsible for changes in the magnitude v
of the linear velocity . Like , that part of the linear acceleration is tangent to
the path of the point in question.We call it the tangential component at of the lin-
ear acceleration of the point, and we write
at ! ar

shown in cross section viewed from above.
Every point of the body (such as P) moves
in a circle around the rotation axis. (a) The
linear velocity 
of every point is tangent to
the circle in which the point moves. (b) The
linear acceleration 
of the point has (in
general) two components: tangential at and
radial ar.
