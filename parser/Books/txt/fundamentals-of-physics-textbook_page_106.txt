4.19 Apply the relationship between a particle’s position, ve-
locity, and acceleration as measured from two reference
where 
is the velocity of B with respect to A. Both 
observers measure the same acceleration for the particle:

Key Idea
●When two frames of reference A and B are moving relative
to each other at constant velocity, the velocity of a particle 
P as measured by an observer in frame A usually differs from
that measured from frame B. The two measured velocities are
related by
Relative Motion in Two Dimensions
Our two observers are again watching a moving particle P from the origins of refer-
ence frames A and B, while B moves at a constant velocity 
relative to A. (The
corresponding axes of these two frames remain parallel.) Figure 4-19 shows a cer-
tain instant during the motion.At that instant, the position vector of the origin of B
relative to the origin of A is 
.Also,the position vectors of particle P are 
rela-
tive to the origin of A and 
relative to the origin of B. From the arrangement of
heads and tails of those three position vectors,we can relate the vectors with
(4-43)
By taking the time derivative of this equation, we can relate the velocities 
and 
of particle P relative to our observers:
(4-44)
By taking the time derivative of this relation, we can relate the accelerations 
and 
of the particle P relative to our observers. However, note that because
is constant, its time derivative is zero.Thus, we get
(4-45)
As for one-dimensional motion, we have the following rule: Observers on differ-
ent frames of reference that move at constant velocity relative to each other will
measure the same acceleration for a moving particle.

Sample Problem 4.08 Relative motion, two dimensional, airplanes
In Fig. 4-20a, a plane moves due east while the pilot points
the plane somewhat south of east, toward a steady wind that
blows to the northeast. The plane has velocity 
relative
to the wind, with an airspeed (speed relative to the wind)
of 215 km/h, directed at angle u south of east. The wind
has velocity 
relative to the ground with speed 
65.0 km/h, directed 20.0° east of north. What is the magni-
tude of the velocity 
of the plane relative to the ground,
and what is ?

KEY IDEAS
The situation is like the one in Fig. 4-19. Here the moving par-
ticle P is the plane, frame A is attached to the ground (call it
G), and frame B is “attached” to the wind (call it W).We need
a vector diagram like Fig. 4-19 but with three velocity vectors.
Calculations: First we construct a sentence that relates the
three vectors shown in Fig. 4-20b:
