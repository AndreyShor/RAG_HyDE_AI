36    SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
imaginary.  From  this  we  conclude  that  in  the  theory 
of  relativity  the  velocity  c  plays  the  part  of  a  limiting 
velocity,  which  can  neither  be  reached  nor  exceeded 
by  any  real  body. 
Of  course  this  feature  of  the  velocity  c  as  a  limiting 
velocity  also  clearly  follows  from  the  equations  of  the 
Lorentz  transformation,  for  these  become  meaningless 
if  we  choose  values  of  v  greater  than  c. 
If,  on  the  contrary,  we  had  considered  a  metre-rod 
at  rest  in  the  #-axis  with  respect  to  K,  then  we  should 
have  found  that  the  length  of  the  rod  as  judged  from 
K'  would  have  been  J~Lâ€”VZ/CZ ;  this  is  quite  in  accord 
ance  with  the  principle  of  relativity  which  forms  the 
basis  of  our  considerations. 
A  priori  it  is  quite  clear  that  we  must  be  able  to 
learn  something  about  the  physical  behaviour  of  measur 
ing-rods  and  clocks  from  the  equations  of  transforma 
tion,  for  the  magnitudes  x,  y,  z,  t,  are  nothing  more  nor 
less  than  the  results  of  measurements  obtainable  by 
means  of  measuring-rods  and  clocks.  If  we  had  based 
our  considerations  on  the  Galilei  transformation  we 
should  not  have  obtained  a  contraction  of  the  rod  as  a 
consequence  of  its  motion. 
Let  us  now  consider  a  seconds-clock  which  is  per 
manently  situated  at  the  origin  (x'=o)  of  K'.  f=o 
and  t'=i  are  two  successive  ticks  of  this  clock.  The 
first  and  fourth  equations  of  the  Lorentz  transformation 
give  for  these  two  ticks  : 
t  =  Q 
and
