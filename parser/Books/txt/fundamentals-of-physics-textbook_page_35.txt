PROBLEMS

You can easily convert common units and measures electroni-
cally, but you still should be able to use a conversion table, such as
those in Appendix D. Table 1-6 is part of a conversion table for a
system of volume measures once common in Spain; a volume of 1
fanega is equivalent to 55.501 dm3 (cubic decimeters).To complete
the table, what numbers (to three significant figures) should be en-
tered in (a) the cahiz column, (b) the fanega column, (c) the cuar-
tilla column, and (d) the almude column, starting with the top
blank? Express 7.00 almudes in (e) medios, (f) cahizes, and (g) cu-
bic centimeters (cm3).

Hydraulic engineers in the United States often use, as a
unit of volume of water, the acre-foot, defined as the volume of wa-
ter that will cover 1 acre of land to a depth of 1 ft. A severe thun-
derstorm dumped 2.0 in. of rain in 30 min on a town of area 26
km2.What volume of water, in acre-feet, fell on the town?

Time

Until 1883, every city and town in the United States kept its
own local time. Today, travelers reset their watches only when the
time change equals 1.0 h. How far, on the average, must you travel
in degrees of longitude between the time-zone boundaries at
which your watch must be reset by 1.0 h? (Hint: Earth rotates 360°
in about 24 h.)

For about 10 years after the French Revolution, the French
government attempted to base measures of time on multiples of
ten: One week consisted of 10 days, one day consisted of 10 hours,
one hour consisted of 100 minutes, and one minute consisted of 100
seconds.What are the ratios of (a) the French decimal week to the
standard week and (b) the French decimal second to the standard
second?

across the Charles River, has a length of 364.4 Smoots plus one
ear. The unit of one Smoot is based on the length of Oliver Reed
Smoot, Jr., class of 1962, who was carried or dragged length by
length across the bridge so that other pledge members of the
Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity could mark off (with paint) 
1-Smoot lengths along the bridge.The marks have been repainted
biannually by fraternity pledges since the initial measurement,
usually during times of traffic congestion so that the police can-
not easily interfere. (Presumably, the police were originally up-
set because the Smoot is not an SI base unit, but these days they
seem to have accepted the unit.) Figure 1-4 shows three parallel
paths, measured in Smoots (S), Willies (W), and Zeldas (Z).
What is the length of 50.0 Smoots in (a) Willies and (b) Zeldas?

Antarctica is roughly semicircular, with a radius of 2000 km
(Fig. 1-5). The average thickness of its ice cover is 3000 m. How
many cubic centimeters of ice does Antarctica contain? (Ignore

do not have simultaneous readings of zero. Figure 1-6 shows si-
multaneous readings on pairs of the clocks for four occasions. (At
the earliest occasion, for example, B reads 25.0 s and C reads 92.0
s.) If two events are 600 s apart on clock A, how far apart are they
on (a) clock B and (b) clock C? (c) When clock A reads 400 s, what
does clock B read? (d) When clock C reads 15.0 s, what does clock B
read? (Assume negative readings for prezero times.)

A fortnight is a charming English measure of time equal to
2.0 weeks (the word is a contraction of “fourteen nights”).That is a
nice amount of time in pleasant company but perhaps a painful
string of microseconds in unpleasant company. How many mi-
croseconds are in a fortnight?

Time standards are now based on atomic clocks. A promis-
ing second standard is based on pulsars, which are rotating neu-
tron stars (highly compact stars consisting only of neutrons).
Some rotate at a rate that is highly stable, sending out a radio
beacon that sweeps briefly across Earth once with each rotation,
like a lighthouse beacon. Pulsar PSR 1937 # 21 is an example; it
rotates once every 1.557 806 448 872 75 % 3 ms, where the trailing
%3 indicates the uncertainty in the last decimal place (it does not
mean %3 ms). (a) How many rotations does PSR 1937 # 21 make
in 7.00 days? (b) How much time does the pulsar take to rotate ex-
actly one million times and (c) what is the associated uncertainty?
