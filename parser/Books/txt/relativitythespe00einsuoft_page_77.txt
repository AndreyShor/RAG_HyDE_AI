PART   II 
THE  GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
XVIII 
SPECIAL  AND  GENERAL  PRINCIPLE  OF 
RELATIVITY 
THE  basal  principle,  which  was  the  pivot  of  all 
our    previous   considerations,    was    the    special 
principle  of  relativity,  i.e.  the  principle  of  the 
physical  relativity  of  all  uniform  motion.     Let  us  once 
more  analyse  its  meaning  carefully. 
It  was  at  all  times  clear  that,  from  the  point  of  view 
of  the  idea  it  conveys  to  us,  every  motion  must  only 
be  considered  as  a  relative  motion.  Returning  to  the 
illustration  we  have  frequently  used  of  the  embankment 
and  the  railway  carriage,  we  can  express  the  fact  of  the 
motion  here  taking  place  in  the  following  two  forms, 
both  of  which  are  equally  justifiable  : 
(a)  The  carriage  is  in  motion  relative  to  the  embank 
ment. 
(b)  The  embankment  is  in  motion  relative  to  the 
carriage. 
In  (a)  the  embankment,  in  (b)  the  carriage,  serves  as 
the  body  of  reference  in  our  statement  of  the  motion 
taking  place.  If  it  is  simply  a  question  of  detecting
