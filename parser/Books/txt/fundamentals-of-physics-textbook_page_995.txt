Assume that an electron of mass m and charge magnitude e
moves in a circular orbit of radius r about a nucleus. A uniform
magnetic field 
is then established perpendicular to the plane of
the orbit. Assuming also that the radius of the orbit does not
change and that the change in the speed of the electron due to field
is small, find an expression for the change in the orbital magnetic
dipole moment of the electron due to the field.

A sample of the paramagnetic salt to which the magnetization
curve of Fig. 32-14 applies is to be tested to see whether it obeys
Curie’s law.The sample is placed in a uniform 0.50 T magnetic field
