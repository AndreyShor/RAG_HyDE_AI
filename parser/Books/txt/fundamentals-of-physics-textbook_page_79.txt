3-3 MULTIPLYING VECTORS
Continuing to expand Eq. 3-26, you can show that

" (aybz $ byaz) # (azbx $ bzax) # (axby $ bxay) .
(3-27)
A determinant (Appendix E) or a vector-capable calculator can also be used.
To check whether any xyz coordinate system is a right-handed coordinate
system, use the right-hand rule for the cross product '
"
with that system. If
your fingers sweep (positive direction of x) into (positive direction of y) with
the outstretched thumb pointing in the positive direction of z (not the negative
direction), then the system is right-handed.
