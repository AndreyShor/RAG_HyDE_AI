PROBLEMS

Consider the fission of 238U by fast neutrons. In one
fission event, no neutrons are emitted and the final stable end
products, after the beta decay of the primary fission fragments, are
140Ce and 99Ru. (a) What is the total of the beta-decay events in the
two beta-decay chains? (b) Calculate Q for this fission process.
The relevant atomic and particle masses are

Assume that immediately after the fission of 236U accord-
ing to Eq. 43-1, the resulting 140Xe and 94Sr nuclei are just touching
at their surfaces. (a) Assuming the nuclei to be spherical, calculate
the electric potential energy associated with the repulsion between
the two fragments. (Hint: Use Eq. 42-3 to calculate the radii of the
fragments.) (b) Compare this energy with the energy released in a
typical fission event.
••14
A 236U nucleus undergoes fission and breaks into two mid-
dle-mass fragments, 140Xe and 96Sr. (a) By what percentage does
the surface area of the fission products differ from that of the origi-
nal 236U nucleus? (b) By what percentage does the volume change?
(c) By what percentage does the electric potential energy change?
The electric potential energy of a uniformly charged sphere of ra-
dius r and charge Q is given by

A 66 kiloton atomic bomb is fueled with pure 235U (Fig.
43-14), 4.0% of which actually undergoes fission. (a) What is the
mass of the uranium in the bomb? (It is not 66 kilotons—that is
the amount of released energy specified in terms of the mass of
TNT required to produce the same amount of energy.) (b) How
many primary fission fragments are produced? (c) How many fis-
sion neutrons generated are released to the environment? (On av-
erage, each fission produces 2.5 neutrons.)

TNT required to produce the same energy release. One megaton
of TNT releases 2.6
1028 MeV of energy. (a) Calculate the rating,
in tons of TNT, of an atomic bomb containing 95.0 kg of 239Pu, of
which 2.5 kg actually undergoes fission. (See Problem 4.) (b) Why
is the other 92.5 kg of 239Pu needed if it does not fission?

In a particular fission event in which 235U is fis-
sioned by slow neutrons, no neutron is emitted and one of the pri-
mary fission fragments is 83Ge. (a) What is the other fragment? The
disintegration energy is Q ! 170 MeV. How much of this energy
goes to (b) the 83Ge fragment and (c) the other fragment? Just af-
ter the fission, what is the speed of (d) the 83Ge fragment and (e)
the other fragment?

The Nuclear Reactor
•18
A 200 MW fission reactor consumes half its fuel in 3.00 y.
How much 235U did it contain initially? Assume that all the energy
generated arises from the fission of 235U and that this nuclide is
consumed only by the fission process.
••19
The neutron generation time tgen in a reactor is the average
time needed for a fast neutron emitted in one fission event to be
slowed to thermal energies by the moderator and then initiate an-
other fission event. Suppose the power output of a reactor at time 
t ! 0 is P0. Show that the power output a time t later is P(t), where
and k is the multiplication factor. For constant
power output, k ! 1.
••20
A reactor operates at 400 MW with a neutron generation
time (see Problem 19) of 30.0 ms. If its power increases for 5.00
min with a multiplication factor of 1.0003, what is the power output
at the end of the 5.00 min?
••21
The thermal energy generated when radiation from radionu-
clides is absorbed in matter can serve as the basis for a small power
source for use in satellites, remote weather stations, and other iso-
lated locations. Such radionuclides are manufactured in abundance
in nuclear reactors and may be separated chemically from the spent
fuel. One suitable radionuclide is 238Pu (T1/2 ! 87.7 y), which is an
alpha emitter with Q ! 5.50 MeV. At what rate is thermal energy
generated in 1.00 kg of this material?
••22
The neutron generation time tgen (see Problem 19) in a par-
ticular reactor is 1.0 ms. If the reactor is operating at a power level
of 500 MW, about how many free neutrons are present in the reac-
tor at any moment?
••23
The neutron generation time (see Problem 19)
of a particular reactor is 1.3 ms.The reactor is generating energy at
the rate of 1200.0 MW.To perform certain maintenance checks, the
power level must temporarily be reduced to 350.00 MW. It is de-
sired that the transition to the reduced power level take 2.6000 s.
To what (constant) value should the multiplication factor be set to
effect the transition in the desired time?
••24
(See Problem 21.) Among the many fission products that
may be extracted chemically from the spent fuel of a nuclear reac-
tor is 90Sr (T1/2 ! 29 y).This isotope is produced in typical large re-
actors at the rate of about 18 kg/y. By its radioactivity, the isotope
generates thermal energy at the rate of 0.93 W/g. (a) Calculate the
effective disintegration energy Qeff associated with the decay of a
90Sr nucleus. (This energy Qeff includes contributions from the de-
cay of the 90Sr daughter products in its decay chain but not from
neutrinos, which escape totally from the sample.) (b) It is desired
to construct a power source generating 150 W (electric power) to
use in operating electronic equipment in an underwater acoustic
