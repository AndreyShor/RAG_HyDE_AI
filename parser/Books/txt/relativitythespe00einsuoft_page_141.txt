THE  EXPERIMENTAL  CONFIRMATION  OF  THE 
GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
FROM  a  systematic  theoretical  point  of  view,  we 
may  imagine  the  process  of  evolution  of  an  em 
pirical  science  to  be  a  continuous  process  of  in 
duction.  Theories  are  evolved  and  are  expressed  in 
short  compass  as  statements  of  a  large  number  of  in 
dividual  observations  in  the  form  of  empirical  laws, 
from  which  the  general  laws  can  be  ascertained  by  com 
parison.  Regarded  in  this  way,  the  development  of  a 
science  bears  some  resemblance  to  the  compilation  of  a 
classified  catalogue.  It  is,  as  it  were,  a  purely  empirical 
enterprise. 
But  this  point  of  view  by  no  means  embraces  the  whole 
of  the  actual  process  ;  for  it  slurs  over  the  important 
part  played  by  intuition  and  deductive  thought  in  the 
development  of  an  exact  science.  As  soon  as  a  science 
has  emerged  from  its  initial  stages,  theoretical  advances 
are  no  longer  achieved  merely  by  a  process  of  arrange 
ment.  Guided  by  empirical  data,  the  investigator 
rather  develops  a  system  of  thought  which,  in  general, 
is  built  up  logically  from  a  small  number  of  fundamental 
assumptions,  the  so-called  axioms.  We  call  such  a 
system  of  thought  a  theory.  The  theory  finds  the
