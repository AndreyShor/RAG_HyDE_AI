Inelastic Collisions in One Dimension
One-Dimensional Inelastic Collision
Figure 9-14 shows two bodies just before and just after they have a one-
dimensional collision. The velocities before the collision (subscript i) and after
the collision (subscript f ) are indicated.The two bodies form our system, which is
closed and isolated.We can write the law of conservation of linear momentum for
this two-body system as
,
which we can symbolize as
(conservation of linear momentum).
(9-50)
Because the motion is one-dimensional, we can drop the overhead arrows for
vectors and use only components along the axis, indicating direction with a sign.
Thus, from p ! mv, we can rewrite Eq. 9-50 as
m1v1i & m2v2i ! m1v1f & m2v2f.
(9-51)
If we know values for, say, the masses, the initial velocities, and one of the final ve-
locities, we can find the other final velocity with Eq. 9-51.
One-Dimensional Completely Inelastic Collision
Figure 9-15 shows two bodies before and after they have a completely inelastic
collision (meaning they stick together).The body with mass m2 happens to be ini-
tially at rest (v2i ! 0).We can refer to that body as the target and to the incoming
body as the projectile. After the collision, the stuck-together bodies move with
velocity V. For this situation, we can rewrite Eq. 9-51 as
m1v1i ! (m1 & m2)V
(9-52)
or
.
(9-53)
If we know values for, say, the masses and the initial velocity v1i of the projectile,
we can find the final velocity V with Eq. 9-53. Note that V must be less than v1i be-
cause the mass ratio m1/(m1 & m2) must be less than unity.
Velocity of the Center of Mass
In a closed, isolated system, the velocity 
of the center of mass of the system
cannot be changed by a collision because, with the system isolated, there is no net
external force to change it. To get an expression for
