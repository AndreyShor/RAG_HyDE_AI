15-5 DAMPED SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION
Substituting dx/dt for v and d2x/dt 2 for a and rearranging give us the differential
equation
.
(15-41)
The solution of this equation is
x(t) $ xm e!bt/2m cos(v#t % f),
(15-42)
where xm is the amplitude and v# is the angular frequency of the damped oscilla-
tor.This angular frequency is given by
(15-43)
If b $ 0 (there is no damping), then Eq. 15-43 reduces to Eq. 15-12 (
)
for the angular frequency of an undamped oscillator, and Eq. 15-42 reduces to
Eq. 15-3 for the displacement of an undamped oscillator. If the damping constant
is small but not zero (so that b &
), then v# % v.
Damped Energy. We can regard Eq.15-42 as a cosine function whose amplitude,
which is xm e!bt/2m, gradually decreases with time, as Fig. 15-17 suggests. For an un-
damped oscillator, the mechanical energy is constant and is given by Eq. 15-21 (E $
kx2
m).If the oscillator is damped,the mechanical energy is not constant but decreases
with time. If the damping is small, we can find E(t) by replacing xm in Eq. 15-21 with 
xm e!bt/2m,the amplitude of the damped oscillations.By doing so,we find that
E(t) % kx2
me!bt/m,
(15-44)
which tells us that, like the amplitude, the mechanical energy decreases exponen-
tially with time.

Here are three sets of values for the spring constant, damping constant, and mass
for the damped oscillator of Fig. 15-16. Rank the sets according to the time re-
quired for the mechanical energy to decrease to one-fourth of its initial value,
greatest first.
