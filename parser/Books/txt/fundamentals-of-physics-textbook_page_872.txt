We can further simplify the quantity B cos u in Eq. 29-15 by noting that 
is
tangent to the loop at every point along the loop, as is 
. Thus,
and 
are
either parallel or antiparallel at each point of the loop, and we shall arbitrarily
assume the former. Then at every point the angle u between 
and 
is 0°, so
cos u ! cos 0° ! 1.The integral in Eq. 29-15 then becomes
Note that - ds is the summation of all the line segment lengths ds around the
circular loop; that is, it simply gives the circumference 2pr of the loop.
Our right-hand rule gives us a plus sign for the current of Fig. 29-14.The right
side of Ampere’s law becomes &m0i, and we then have
B(2pr) ! m0i
or
(outside straight wire).
(29-17)
With a slight change in notation, this is Eq. 29-4, which we derived earlier—with
considerably more effort—using the law of Biot and Savart. In addition, because
the magnitude B turned out positive, we know that the correct direction of 
must be the one shown in Fig. 29-14.
Magnetic Field Inside a Long Straight Wire with Current
Figure 29-15 shows the cross section of a long straight wire of radius R that
carries a uniformly distributed current i directly out of the page. Because the
current is uniformly distributed over a cross section of the wire, the magnetic
field 
produced by the current must be cylindrically symmetrical. Thus, to find
the magnetic field at points inside the wire, we can again use an Amperian loop of
radius r, as shown in Fig. 29-15, where now r + R. Symmetry again suggests that 
is tangent to the loop, as shown; so the left side of Ampere’s law again yields
(29-18)
Because the current is uniformly distributed, the current ienc encircled by the loop
is proportional to the area encircled by the loop; that is,
(29-19)
Our right-hand rule tells us that ienc gets a plus sign. Then Ampere’s law gives us
or
(inside straight wire).
(29-20)
Thus, inside the wire, the magnitude B of the magnetic field is proportional to r,
is zero at the center, and is maximum at r ! R (the surface). Note that Eqs. 29-17
and 29-20 give the same value for B at the surface.
