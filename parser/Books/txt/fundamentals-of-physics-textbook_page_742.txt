Figure 24-68 shows a hemi-
sphere with a charge of 4.00 mC dis-
tributed uniformly through its vol-
ume. The hemisphere lies on an xy
plane the way half a grapefruit might
lie face down on a kitchen table.
Point P is located on the plane, along a radial line from the hemi-
sphere’s center of curvature, at radial distance 15 cm. What is the
electric potential at point P due to the hemisphere?

Three %0.12 C charges form an equilateral triangle 1.7 m

A solid copper sphere whose radius is 1.0 cm has a very
thin surface coating of nickel. Some of the nickel atoms are
radioactive, each atom emitting an electron as it decays. Half
of these electrons enter the copper sphere, each depositing 100 keV
of energy there.The other half of the electrons escape, each carrying
away a charge #e.The nickel coating has an activity of 3.70 $ 108 ra-
dioactive decays per second. The sphere is hung from a long, non-
conducting string and isolated from its surroundings. (a) How long
will it take for the potential of the sphere to increase by 1000 V? (b)
How long will it take for the temperature of the sphere to increase
by 5.0 K due to the energy deposited by the electrons? The heat
capacity of the sphere is 14 J/K.
