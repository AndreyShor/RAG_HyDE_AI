July 17, 1981, Kansas City: The newly opened Hyatt
Regency is packed with people listening and dancing to a band
playing favorites from the 1940s. Many of the people are crowded
onto the walkways that hang like bridges across the wide atrium.
Suddenly two of the walkways collapse, falling onto the merrymak-
ers on the main floor.
The walkways were suspended one above another on vertical
rods and held in place by nuts threaded onto the rods. In the origi-
nal design, only two long rods were to be used, each extending
through all three walkways (Fig. 5-24a). If each walkway and the
merrymakers on it have a combined mass of M, what is the total
mass supported by the threads and two nuts on (a) the lowest
walkway and (b) the highest walkway?
Apparently someone responsible for the actual construction
realized that threading nuts on a rod is impossible except at the
ends, so the design was changed: Instead, six rods were used, each
connecting two walkways (Fig. 5-24b). What now is the total mass
supported by the threads and two nuts on (c) the lowest walkway,
(d) the upper side of the highest walkway, and (e) the lower side of
the highest walkway? It was this design that failed on that tragic
night—a simple engineering error.

Two horizontal forces,
pull a banana split across a friction-
less lunch counter. Without using a
calculator, determine which of the
vectors in the free-body diagram of
Fig. 5-20 best represent (a) 
and
(b) 
. What is the net-force compo-
nent along (c) the x axis and (d) the y
axis? Into which quadrants do (e) the
net-force vector and (f) the split’s ac-
celeration vector point?

In Fig. 5-21, forces 
and 
are applied to a lunchbox as it
slides at constant velocity over a
frictionless floor. We are to de-
crease angle u without changing the
magnitude of 
. For constant ve-
locity, should we increase, decrease,
or maintain the magnitude of 
?

At time t " 0, constant 
begins
to act on a rock moving through
deep space in the +x direction. (a)
For time t . 0, which are possible functions x(t) for the rock’s posi-
tion: (1) x " 4t $ 3, (2) x " $4t2 # 6t $ 3, (3) x " 4t2 # 6t $ 3? (b)
For which function is 
directed opposite the rock’s initial direction
of motion?

Figure 5-22 shows overhead views of four situations in which
forces act on a block that lies on a frictionless floor. If the force
magnitudes are chosen properly, in which situations is it possible
that the block is (a) stationary and (b) moving with a constant
velocity?
