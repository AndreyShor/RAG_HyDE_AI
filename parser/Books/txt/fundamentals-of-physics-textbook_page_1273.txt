The Stern–Gerlach Experiment
•13
What is the acceleration of a silver atom as it passes
through the deflecting magnet in the Stern–Gerlach experiment of
Fig. 40-8 if the magnetic field gradient is 1.4 T/mm?
•14
Suppose that a hydrogen atom in its ground state moves 80
cm through and perpendicular to a vertical magnetic field that has
a magnetic field gradient dB/dz ! 1.6 " 10 2 T/m. (a) What is the
magnitude of force exerted by the field gradient on the atom due
to the magnetic moment of the atom’s electron, which we take to
be 1 Bohr magneton? (b) What is the vertical displacement of the
atom in the 80 cm of travel if its speed is 1.2 " 105 m/s?
•15
Calculate the (a) smaller and (b) larger value of the semiclas-
sical angle between the electron spin angular momentum vector
and the magnetic field in a Stern–Gerlach experiment. Bear in
mind that the orbital angular momentum of the valence electron in
the silver atom is zero.
•16
Assume that in the Stern–Gerlach experiment as described for
neutral silver atoms, the magnetic field 
has a magnitude of 0.50 T.
(a) What is the energy difference between the magnetic moment ori-
entations of the silver atoms in the two subbeams? (b) What is the
frequency of the radiation that would induce a transition between
these two states? (c) What is the wavelength of this radiation,and (d)
to what part of the electromagnetic spectrum does it belong?

Magnetic Resonance
•17
In an NMR experiment, the RF source oscillates at 34 MHz
and magnetic resonance of the hydrogen atoms in the sample being in-
vestigated occurs when the external field 
has magnitude 0.78 T.
Assume that 
and 
are in the same direction and take the pro-
ton magnetic moment component mz to be 1.41
10#26 J/T. What is
the magnitude of 
?
•18
A hydrogen atom in its ground state actually has two possi-
ble, closely spaced energy levels because the electron is in the mag-
netic field 
of the proton (the nucleus). Accordingly, an energy is
associated with the orientation of the electron’s magnetic moment
relative to , and the electron is said to be either spin up (higher
energy) or spin down (lower energy) in that field. If the electron is
excited to the higher-energy level, it can de-excite by spin-flipping
and emitting a photon. The wavelength associated with that
photon is 21 cm. (Such a process occurs extensively in the Milky
Way galaxy, and reception of the 21 cm radiation by radio tele-
scopes reveals where hydrogen gas lies between stars.) What is the
effective magnitude of 
as experienced by the electron in the
ground-state hydrogen atom?
•19
What is the wavelength associated with a photon that will induce
a transition of an electron spin from parallel to antiparallel orientation
in a magnetic field of magnitude 0.200T? Assume that
