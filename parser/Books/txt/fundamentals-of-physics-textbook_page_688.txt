The loop on the integral sign indicates that we must integrate over the entire closed
surface, to get the net flux through the surface (as in Fig. 23-5, flux might enter on
one side and leave on another side). Keep in mind that we want to determine the
net flux through a surface because that is what Gauss’ law relates to the charge en-
closed by the surface.(The law is coming up next.) Note that flux is a scalar (yes,we
talk about field vectors but flux is the amount of piercing field, not a vector itself).
The SI unit of flux is the newton–square-meter per coulomb 
.

GAUSS’ LAW
Checkpoint 1
The figure here shows a Gaussian cube of face area A
immersed in a uniform electric field 
that has the positive
direction of the z axis. In terms of E and A, what is the flux
through (a) the front face (which is in the xy plane), (b) the
rear face, (c) the top face, and (d) the whole cube?

gives the cap’s area A ($ pR2). Similarly, for the
right cap, where 
0 for all points,
Finally, for the cylindrical surface, where the angle u is 90% at
all points,
Substituting these results into Eq. 23-5 leads us to
& $ 'EA " 0 " EA $ 0.
(Answer)
The net flux is zero because the field lines that represent the
electric field all pass entirely through the Gaussian surface,
from the left to the right.

Sample Problem 23.01
Flux through a closed cylinder, uniform field
Figure 23-6 shows a Gaussian surface in the form of a
closed cylinder (a Gaussian cylinder or G-cylinder) of
radius R. It lies in a uniform electric field 
with the
cylinder’s central axis (along the length of the cylinder)
parallel to the field. What is the net flux & of the electric
field through the cylinder?
KEY IDEAS
We can find the net flux & with Eq. 23-4 by integrating the
dot product 
over the cylinder’s surface. However,
we cannot write out functions so that we can do that with
one integral. Instead, we need to be a bit clever: We break
up the surface into sections with which we can actually eval-
uate an integral.
Calculations: We break the integral of Eq. 23-4 into three
terms: integrals over the left cylinder cap a, the curved cylin-
drical surface b,and the right cap c:
(23-5)
Pick a patch element on the left cap. Its area vector 
must be perpendicular to the patch and pointing away from
the interior of the cylinder. In Fig. 23-6, that means the angle
between it and the field piercing the patch is 180%.Also, note
that the electric field through the end cap is uniform and
thus E can be pulled out of the integration.So,we can write the
flux through the left cap as
