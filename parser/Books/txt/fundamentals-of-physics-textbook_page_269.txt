Integrating leads to
in which Mi is the initial mass of the rocket and Mf its final mass. Evaluating the
integrals then gives
(second rocket equation)
(9-88)
for the increase in the speed of the rocket during the change in mass from Mi to
Mf. (The symbol “ln” in Eq. 9-88 means the natural logarithm.) We see here the
advantage of multistage rockets, in which Mf is reduced by discarding successive
stages when their fuel is depleted. An ideal rocket would reach its destination
with only its payload remaining.

REVIEW & SUMMARY
rocket’s mass. However, M decreases and a increases as fuel
is consumed. Because we want the initial value of a here, we
must use the intial value Mi of the mass.
Calculation: We find
(Answer)
To be launched from Earth’s surface, a rocket must have
an initial acceleration greater than 
. That is, it
must be greater than the gravitational acceleration at the
surface. Put another way, the thrust T of the rocket engine
must exceed the initial gravitational force on the rocket,
which here has the magnitude Mig, which gives us 
(850 kg)(9.8 m/s2) ! 8330 N.
Because the acceleration or thrust requirement is not met
(here T ! 6400 N), our rocket could not be launched from
Earth’s surface by itself; it would require another, more
powerful, rocket.

Rocket engine, thrust, acceleration
In all previous examples in this chapter, the mass of a system
is constant (fixed as a certain number).Here is an example of
a system (a rocket) that is losing mass.A rocket whose initial
mass Mi is 850 kg consumes fuel at the rate 
The
speed vrel of the exhaust gases relative to the rocket engine is
2800 m/s.What thrust does the rocket engine provide?
KEY IDEA
Thrust T is equal to the product of the fuel consumption
rate R and the relative speed vrel at which exhaust gases are
expelled, as given by Eq. 9-87.
Calculation: Here we find
(Answer)
(b) What is the initial acceleration of the rocket?
KEY IDEA
We can relate the thrust T of a rocket to the magnitude a of
the resulting acceleration with 
, where M is the
