132  APPENDIX  in 
Mean  displacements  of  lines  towards  the  less  re 
frangible  end  of  the  spectrum  are  certainly  revealed  by 
statistical  investigations  of  the  fixed  stars  ;  but  up 
to  the  present  the  examination  of  the  available  data 
does  not  allow  of  any  definite  decision  being  arrived  at, 
as  to  whether  or  not  these  displacements  are  to  be 
referred  in  reality  to  the  effect  of  gravitation.  The 
results  of  observation  have  been  collected  together, 
and  discussed  in  detail  from  the  standpoint  of  the 
question  which  has  been  engaging  our  attention  here, 
in  a  paper  by  E.  Freundlich  entitled  "  Zur  Priifung  der 
aligemeinen  Relativitats-Theorie "  (Die  Naturwissen- 
schaften,  1919,  No.  35,  p.  520  :  Julius  Springer,  Berlin). 
At  all  events,  a  definite  decision  will  be  reached  during 
the  next  few  years.  If  the  displacement  of  spectral 
lines  towards  the  red  by  the  gravitational  potential 
does  not  exist,  then  the  general  theory  of  relativity 
will  be  untenable.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  cause  of 
the  displacement  of  spectral  lines  be  definitely  traced 
to  the  gravitational  potential,  then  the  study  of  this 
displacement  will  furnish  us  with  important  informa 
tion  as  to  the  mass  of  the  heavenly  bodies.
