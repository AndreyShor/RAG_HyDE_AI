Figure 22-13a shows a plastic rod with a uniform charge
%Q. It is bent in a 120° circular arc of radius  r and symmet-
rically paced across an x axis with the origin at the center of
curvature P of the rod. In terms of Q and r, what is the elec-
tric field 
due to the rod at point P?
KEY IDEA
Because the rod has a continuous charge distribution,we must
find an expression for the electric fields due to differential ele-
ments of the rod and then sum those fields via calculus.
An element: Consider a differential element having arc
length ds and located at an angle u above the x axis (Figs.
22-13b and c). If we let l represent the linear charge density of
the rod,our element ds has a differential charge of magnitude
dq ! l ds.
(22-18)
The element’s field: Our element produces a differential
electric field 
at point P, which is a distance r from the 
element. Treating the element as a point charge, we can

as
(22-19)
The direction of 
is toward ds because charge dq is negative.
Symmetric partner: Our element has a symmetrically 
located (mirror image) element ds, in the bottom half of the
rod. The electric field 
set up at P by ds, also has the
magnitude given by Eq. 22-19, but the field vector points to-
ward 
as shown in Fig. 22-13d. If we resolve the electric
field vectors of ds and 
into x and y components as shown
in Figs. 22-13e and f, we see that their y components cancel
(because they have equal magnitudes and are in opposite
directions). We also see that their x components have equal
magnitudes and are in the same direction.
Summing: Thus, to find the electric field set up by the rod,
we need sum (via integration) only the x components of the
differential electric fields set up by all the differential ele-
ments of the rod. From Fig. 22-13f and Eq. 22-19, we can write
