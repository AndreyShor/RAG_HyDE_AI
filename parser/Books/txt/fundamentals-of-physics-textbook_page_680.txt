of the dipole’s electric field at point P, located at distance r

In Fig. 22-42, the three particles are
fixed in place and have charges q1 ! q2 !
#e and q3 ! #2e. Distance a ! 6.00 mm.
What are the (a) magnitude and (b) direc-
tion of the net electric field at point P due to
the particles?

Figure 22-43 shows a plastic ring of
radius R ! 50.0 cm. Two small charged
beads are on the ring: Bead 1 of charge
#2.00 mC is fixed in place at the left side;
bead 2 of charge #6.00 mC can be
moved along the ring. The two
beads produce a net electric field of
magnitude E at the center of the
ring. At what (a) positive and (b)
negative value of angle u should
bead 2 be positioned such that E !
2.00 $ 105 N/C?

Two charged beads are on
the plastic ring in Fig. 22-44a. Bead
2, which is not shown, is fixed in
place on the ring, which has radius
R ! 60.0 cm. Bead 1, which is not fixed in place, is initially on the x
axis at angle u ! 0". It is then moved to the opposite side, at angle
u ! 180", through the first and second quadrants of the xy
coordinate system. Figure 22-44b gives the x component of the net
electric field produced at the origin by the two beads as a function
of u, and Fig. 22-44c gives the y component of that net electric field.
The vertical axis scales are set by Exs ! 5.0 $ 104 N/C and Eys !
%9.0 $ 104 N/C. (a) At what angle u is bead 2 located? What are
the charges of (b) bead 1 and (c) bead 2?

Equations 22-8 and 22-9 are approximations of the magnitude
of the electric field of an electric dipole, at points along the dipole
axis.Consider a point P on that axis at distance z ! 5.00d from the di-
pole center (d is the separation distance between the particles of the
dipole). Let Eappr be the magnitude of the field at point P as approxi-
mated by Eqs.22-8 and 22-9.Let Eact be the actual magnitude.What is
the ratio Eappr/Eact?
•••21
Electric quadrupole. Fig-
ure 22-46 shows a generic electric
quadrupole. It consists of two dipoles
with dipole moments that are equal in
magnitude but opposite in direction.
Show that the value of E on the axis
of the quadrupole for a point P a dis-
tance z from its center (assume z
d) is given by
in which Q (! 2qd 2) is known as the quadrupole moment of the
charge distribution.

tributed along a circular arc of radius 4.00 cm, which subtends an
angle of 40".What is the linear charge density along the arc? (b) A
charge %300e is uniformly distributed over one face of a circular
disk of radius 2.00 cm.What is the surface charge density over that
face? (c) A charge %300e is uniformly distributed over the surface
of a sphere of radius 2.00 cm. What is the surface charge density
over that surface? (d) A charge %300e is uniformly spread through
the volume of a sphere of radius 2.00 cm. What is the volume
charge density in that sphere?

Figure 22-47 shows two paral-
lel nonconducting rings with their
central axes along a common line.
Ring 1 has uniform charge q1 and ra-
dius R; ring 2 has uniform charge q2
and the same radius R. The rings are
separated by distance d ! 3.00R.The
net electric field at point P on the
common line, at distance R from ring
1,is zero.What is the ratio q1/q2?

The Electric Field Due to a Dipole
••18
The electric field of an electric dipole along the dipole axis is
approximated by Eqs. 22-8 and 22-9. If a binomial expansion is
made of Eq. 22-7, what is the next term in the expression for the di-
pole’s electric field along the dipole axis? That is, what is Enext in
the expression
