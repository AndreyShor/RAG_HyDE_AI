18    SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
intellectual  difficulties  ?     Let   us  consider   how  these 
difficulties  arise. 
Of  course  we  must  refer  the  process  of  the  propaga 
tion  of  light  (and  indeed  every  other  process)  to  a  rigid 
reference-body  (co-ordinate  system).  As  such  a  system 
let  us  again  choose  our  embankment.  We  shall  imagine 
the  air  above  it  to  have  been  removed.  If  a  ray  of 
light  be  sent  along  the  embankment,  we  see  from  the 
above  that  the  tip  of  the  ray  will  be  transmitted  with 
the  velocity  c  relative  to  the  embankment.  Now  let 
us  suppose  that  our  railway  carriage  is  again  travelling 
along  the  railway  lines  with  the  velocity  v,  and  that 
its  direction  is  the  same  as  that  of  the  ray  of  light,  but 
its  velocity  of  course  much  less.  Let  us  inquire  about 
the  velocity  of  propagation  of  the  ray  of  light  relative 
to  the  carriage.  It  is  obvious  that  we  can  here  apply  the 
consideration  of  the  previous  section,  since  the  ray  of 
light  plays  the  part  of  the  man  walking  along  relatively 
to  the  carriage.  The  velocity  W  of  the  man  relative 
to  the  embankment  is  here  replaced  by  the  velocity 
of  light  relative  to  the  embankment,  w  is  the  required 
velocity  of  light  with  respect  to  the  carriage,  and  we 
have 
w  â€”  c  -  v. 
The  velocity  of  propagation  of  a  ray  of  light  relative  to 
the  carriage  thus  comes  out  smaller  than  c. 
But  this  result  comes  into  conflict  with  the  principle 
of  relativity  set  forth  in  Section  V.  For,  like  every 
other  general  law  of  nature,  the  law  of  the  transmission 
of  light  in  vacuo  must,  according  to  the  principle  of 
relativity,  be  the  same  for  the  railway  carriage  as1 
reference-body  as  when  the  rails  are  the  body  of  refeil
