FEYNMAN’S PREFACE
(from The Feynman Lectures on Physics)
These are the lectures in physics that I gave last year and the year
before to the freshman and sophomore classes at Caltech. The lec-
tures are, of course, not verbatim—they have been edited, some-
times extensively and sometimes less so. The lectures form only part
of the complete course. The whole group of 180 students gathered
in a big lecture room twice a week to hear these lectures and then
they broke up into small groups of 15 to 20 students in recitation
sections under the guidance of a teaching assistant. In addition,
there was a laboratory session once a week.
The special problem we tried to get at with these lectures was to
maintain the interest of the very enthusiastic and rather smart stu-
dents coming out of the high schools and into Caltech. They have
heard a lot about how interesting and exciting physics is—the
theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and other modern ideas.
By the end of two years of our previous course, many would be
very discouraged because there were really very few grand, new,
modern ideas presented to them. They were made to study inclined
planes, electrostatics, and so forth, and after two years it was quite
stultifying. The problem was whether or not we could make a
course which would save the more advanced and excited student
by maintaining his enthusiasm.
The lectures here are not in any way meant to be a survey course,
but are very serious. I thought to address them to the most intelli-
gent in the class and to make sure, if possible, that even the most
