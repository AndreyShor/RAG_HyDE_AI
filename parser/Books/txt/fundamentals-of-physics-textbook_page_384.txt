CHAPTER 13
GRAVITATION
Force 
12 is directed in the positive direction of the y axis (Fig.
13-4b) and has only the y component F12. Similarly,
13 is di-
rected in the negative direction of the x axis and has only the x
component %F13 (Fig. 13-4c). (Note something important:We
draw the force diagrams with the tail of a force vector an-
chored on the particle experiencing the force. Drawing them
in other ways invites errors,especially on exams.)
To find the net force 
1,net on particle 1, we must add
the two forces as vectors (Figs. 13-4d and e).We can do so on
a vector-capable calculator. However, here we note that
%F13 and F12 are actually the x and y components of 
1,net.
Therefore, we can use Eq. 3-6 to find first the magnitude and
then the direction of 
1,net.The magnitude is
! 4.1 $ 10%6 N.
(Answer)
Relative to the positive direction of the x axis, Eq. 3-6 gives
the direction of 
1,net as
Is this a reasonable direction (Fig. 13-4f)? No, because the 
direction of 
1,net must be between the directions of 
12 and
13. Recall from Chapter 3 that a calculator displays only
one of the two possible answers to a tan%1 function.We find
the other answer by adding 180°:
%76° # 180° ! 104°,
(Answer)
which is a reasonable direction for 
1,net (Fig. 13-4g).

Sample Problem 13.01
Net gravitational force, 2D, three particles
Figure 13-4a shows an arrangement of three particles, parti-
cle 1 of mass m1 ! 6.0 kg and particles 2 and 3 of mass m2 !
m3 ! 4.0 kg, and distance a ! 2.0 cm. What is the net gravi-
tational force 
1,net on particle 1 due to the other particles?
KEY IDEAS
(1) Because we have particles, the magnitude of the gravita-
tional force on particle 1 due to either of the other particles is
given by Eq. 13-1 (F!Gm1m2/r2). (2) The direction of either
gravitational force on particle 1 is toward the particle responsi-
ble for it. (3) Because the forces are not along a single axis, we
cannot simply add or subtract their magnitudes or their compo-
nents to get the net force.Instead,we must add them as vectors.
Calculations: From Eq. 13-1, the magnitude of the force 
12
on particle 1 from particle 2 is
(13-7)
! 4.00 $ 10%6 N.
Similarly, the magnitude of force 
13 on particle 1 from 
particle 3 is
(13-8)
! 1.00 $ 10%6 N.

on the particle.In this limit,the sum of Eq.13-5 becomes an integral and we have
(13-6)
in which the integral is taken over the entire extended object and we drop the
subscript “net.” If the extended object is a uniform sphere or a spherical shell, we
can avoid the integration of Eq. 13-6 by assuming that the object’s mass is
concentrated at the object’s center and using Eq. 13-1.

Checkpoint 2
The figure shows four arrangements of three particles
of equal masses. (a) Rank the arrangements according
to the magnitude of the net gravitational force on the
particle labeled m, greatest first. (b) In arrangement 2, is
the direction of the net force closer to the line of length
d or to the line of length D?
