and a phase angle b relative to the phasor representing E1 of
We can now write, for the resultant wave E(t),
(Answer)
Be careful to interpret the angle b correctly in Fig. 35-14: It is
the constant angle between ER and the phasor representing
E1 as the four phasors rotate as a single unit around the 
origin. The angle between ER and the horizontal axis in
Fig. 35-14 does not remain equal to b.

Sample Problem 35.04
Combining three light waves by using phasors
Three light waves combine at a certain point where their
electric field components are
Find their resultant component E(t) at that point.
KEY IDEA
The resultant wave is
E(t) ! E1(t) ' E2(t) ' E3(t).
We can use the method of phasors to find this sum, and we
are free to evaluate the phasors at any time t.
Calculations: To simplify the solution, we choose t
0, for
which the phasors representing the three waves are shown
in Fig. 35-14. We can add these three phasors either directly
on a vector-capable calculator or by components. For the
component approach, we first write the sum of their hori-
zontal components as
Eh ! E0 cos 0 ' E0 cos 60° ' E0 cos(&30°) ! 2.37E0.
The sum of their vertical components, which is the value of
E at t ! 0, is
Ev ! E0 sin 0 ' E0 sin 60° ' E0 sin(&30°) ! 0.366E0.
The resultant wave E(t) thus has an amplitude ER of

35-4 INTERFERENCE FROM THIN FILMS 
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
35.29 Sketch the setup for thin-film interference, showing
the incident ray and reflected rays (perpendicular to the
film but drawn slightly slanted for clarity) and identifying
the thickness and the three indexes of refraction.
35.30 Identify the condition in which a reflection can result in
a phase shift, and give the value of that phase shift.
35.31 Identify the three factors that determine the interfer-
ence of the reflected waves: reflection shifts, path length
difference, and internal wavelength (set by the film's index
of refraction).
35.32 For a thin film, use the reflection shifts and the desired
result (the reflected waves are in phase or out of phase, or
the transmitted waves are in phase or out of phase) to
determine and then apply the necessary equation relating
the thickness L, the wavelength l (measured in air), and
the index of refraction n of the film.
35.33 For a very thin film in air (with thickness much less
than the wavelength of visible light), explain why the film
is always dark.
35.34 At each end of a thin film in the form of a wedge, deter-
mine and then apply the necessary equation relating the
thickness L, the wavelength l (measured in air), and the
index of refraction n of the film, and then count the number
of bright bands and dark bands across the film.
