If you set up the seventh harmonic on a string, (a) how many
nodes are present, and (b) is there a node, antinode, or some inter-
mediate state at the midpoint? If you next set up the sixth harmonic,
(c) is its resonant wavelength longer or shorter than that for the sev-
enth harmonic, and (d) is
the 
resonant 
frequency
higher or lower?

Figure 16-28 shows
phasor diagrams for three
situations in which two
waves travel along the
same string. All six waves
have the same amplitude. Rank the situations according to the am-
plitude of the net wave on the string, greatest first.

The following four waves are sent along strings with the same
linear densities (x is in meters and t is in seconds). Rank the waves
according to (a) their wave speed and (b) the tension in the strings
along which they travel, greatest first:
(1) y1 # (3 mm) sin(x $ 3t),
(2) y2 # (6 mm) sin(2x $ t),

In Fig. 16-24, wave 1 consists of a rectangular peak of height 4 units
and width d, and a rectangular valley of depth 2 units and width d.The
wave travels rightward along an x axis. Choices 2, 3, and 4 are similar
waves,with the same heights,depths,and widths,that will travel leftward
along that axis and through wave 1. Right-going wave 1 and one of the
left-going waves will interfere as they pass through each other. With
which left-going wave will the interference give, for an instant, (a) the
deepest valley,(b) a flat line,and (c) a flat peak 2d wide?

The amplitudes and phase differences for four pairs of
waves of equal wavelengths are (a) 2 mm, 6 mm, and p rad;
(b) 3 mm, 5 mm, and p rad; (c) 7 mm, 9 mm, and p rad; (d) 2 mm,
2 mm, and 0 rad. Each pair travels in the same direction along the
same string. Without written calculation, rank the four pairs ac-
cording to the amplitude of their resultant wave, greatest first.

A sinusoidal wave is sent along a cord under tension, transport-
ing energy at the average rate of Pavg,1.Two waves, identical to that
first one, are then to be sent along the cord with a phase difference
f of either 0, 0.2 wavelength, or 0.5 wavelength. (a) With only men-
tal calculation, rank those choices of f according to the average
rate at which the waves will transport energy, greatest first. (b) For
the first choice of f, what is the average rate in terms of Pavg,1?
8 (a) If a standing wave on a string is given by
y,(t) # (3 mm) sin(5x) cos(4t),
is there a node or an antinode of the oscillations of the string at 
x # 0? (b) If the standing wave is given by
y,(t) # (3 mm) sin(5x " p/2) cos(4t),
is there a node or an antinode at x # 0?

Strings A and B have identical lengths and linear densities, but
string B is under greater tension than string A. Figure 16-27 shows
four situations, (a) through (d), in which standing wave patterns
exist on the two strings. In which situations is there the possibility
that strings A and B are oscillating at the same resonant frequency?
(3) y3 # (1 mm) sin(4x $ t),
(4) y4 # (2 mm) sin(x $ 2t).

Figure 16-25a gives a snapshot of a wave traveling in the direc-
tion of positive x along a string under tension. Four string elements
are indicated by the lettered points. For each of those elements, de-
termine whether, at the instant of the snapshot, the element is
moving upward or downward or is momentarily at rest. (Hint:
Imagine the wave as it moves through the four string elements, as if
you were watching a video of the wave as it traveled rightward.)
Figure 16-25b gives the displacement of a string element located
at, say, x # 0 as a function of time. At the lettered times, is the
element moving upward or downward or is it momentarily at rest?

are separately sent along a string that is

an x axis. Rank the waves according to
their (a) wavelengths, (b) speeds, and
(c) angular frequencies,greatest first.

If you start with two sinusoidal
waves of the same amplitude travel-
ing in phase on a string and then
somehow phase-shift one of them by
