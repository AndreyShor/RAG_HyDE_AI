8-4 WORK DONE ON A SYSTEM BY AN EXTERNAL FORCE
KEY IDEA
The turning point is where the force momentarily stops and
then reverses the particle’s motion. That is, it is where the
particle momentarily has 
and thus 
.
Calculations: Because
K
is the difference between
, we want the point in Fig. 8-10a where the plot of
U rises to meet the horizontal line of 
, as shown in Fig.
8-10b. Because the plot of U is a straight line in Fig. 8-10b,
we can draw nested right triangles as shown and then write
the proportionality of distances
,
which gives us 
.Thus, the turning point is at
.
(Answer)
(c) Evaluate the force acting on the particle when it is in the
region 
.
KEY IDEA
The force is given by Eq. 8-22 (F(x)! $dU(x)/dx):The force
is equal to the negative of the slope on a graph of U(x).
Calculations: For the graph of Fig. 8-10b, we see that for
the range 
the force is
.

F ! $ 20 J $ 7.0 J
1.0 m $ 4.0 m ! 4.3 N
1.0 m * x * 4.0 m
1.9 m * x * 4.0 m
x ! 4.0 m $ d ! 1.9 m

Thus, the force has magnitude 4.3 N and is in the positive 
direction of the x axis. This result is consistent with the fact
that the initially leftward-moving particle is stopped by the
force and then sent rightward.

particle speed is zero).
8-4 WORK DONE ON A SYSTEM BY AN EXTERNAL FORCE
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
8.13 When work is done on a system by an external force
with no friction involved, determine the changes in kinetic
energy and potential energy.
8.14 When work is done on a system by an external force
with friction involved, relate that work to the changes in
kinetic energy, potential energy, and thermal energy.
●Work W is energy transferred to or from a system by means
of an external force acting on the system. 
●When more than one force acts on a system, their net work
is the transferred energy. 
●When friction is not involved, the work done on the system
and the change %Emec in the mechanical energy of the system
are equal:
W ! %Emec ! %K " %U.
●When a kinetic frictional force acts within the system, then
the thermal energy Eth of the system changes. (This energy is
associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules
in the system.) The work done on the system is then
W ! %Emec " %Eth.
●The change %Eth is related to the magnitude fk of the frictional
force and the magnitude d of the displacement caused by the
external force by
%Eth ! fkd.
