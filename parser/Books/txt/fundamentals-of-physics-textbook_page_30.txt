By 1983, however, the demand for higher precision had reached such a point
that even the krypton-86 standard could not meet it,and in that year a bold step was
taken.The meter was redefined as the distance traveled by light in a specified time
interval.In the words of the 17th General Conference on Weights and Measures:

CHAPTER 1
MEASUREMENT
The meter is the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum during a time
interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.

This time interval was chosen so that the speed of light c is exactly
c " 299 792 458 m/s.
Measurements of the speed of light had become extremely precise, so it made
sense to adopt the speed of light as a defined quantity and to use it to redefine
the meter.
Table 1-3 shows a wide range of lengths, from that of the universe (top line)
to those of some very small objects.
Significant Figures and Decimal Places
Suppose that you work out a problem in which each value consists of two digits.
Those digits are called significant figures and they set the number of digits that
you can use in reporting your final answer. With data given in two significant 
figures, your final answer should have only two significant figures. However,
depending on the mode setting of your calculator, many more digits might be 
displayed.Those extra digits are meaningless.
In this book, final results of calculations are often rounded to match the least
number of significant figures in the given data. (However, sometimes an extra
significant figure is kept.) When the leftmost of the digits to be discarded is 5 or
more, the last remaining digit is rounded up; otherwise it is retained as is. For 
example, 11.3516 is rounded to three significant figures as 11.4 and 11.3279 is
rounded to three significant figures as 11.3. (The answers to sample problems in
this book are usually presented with the symbol " instead of % even if rounding
is involved.)
When a number such as 3.15 or 3.15 ' 103 is provided in a problem,the number
of significant figures is apparent, but how about the number 3000? Is it known to
only one significant figure (3 ' 103)? Or is it known to as many as four significant
figures (3.000 ' 103)? In this book, we assume that all the zeros in such given num-
bers as 3000 are significant,but you had better not make that assumption elsewhere.
Don’t confuse significant figures with decimal places. Consider the lengths
35.6 mm, 3.56 m, and 0.00356 m. They all have three significant figures but they
have one, two, and five decimal places, respectively.
ball’s builder most unhappy. Instead, because we want only
the nearest order of magnitude, we can estimate any quanti-
ties required in the calculation.
Calculations: Let us assume the ball is spherical with radius 
R " 2 m. The string in the ball is not closely packed (there
are uncountable gaps between adjacent sections of string).
To allow for these gaps, let us somewhat overestimate
Sample Problem 1.01 Estimating order of magnitude, ball of string
The world’s largest ball of string is about 2 m in radius. To
the nearest order of magnitude, what is the total length L
of the string in the ball?
KEY IDEA
We could, of course, take the ball apart and measure the to-
tal length L, but that would take great effort and make the
