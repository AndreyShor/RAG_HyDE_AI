CHAPTER 24
ELECTRIC POTENTIAL
Since the charge on the rod is positive and we have taken V $ 0 at infinity, we
know from Module 24-3 that dV in Eq. 24-34 must be positive.
We now find the total potential V produced by the rod at point P by integrat-
ing Eq. 24-34 along the length of the rod, from x $ 0 to x $ L (Figs. 24-15d and e),
using integral 17 in Appendix E.We find
We can simplify this result by using the general relation ln A
ln B
ln(A/B).
We then find
(24-35)
Because V is the sum of positive values of dV, it too is positive, consistent with
the logarithm being positive for an argument greater than 1.
Charged Disk
In Module 22-5, we calculated the magnitude of the electric field at points on the
central axis of a plastic disk of radius R that has a uniform charge density s on
one surface. Here we derive an expression for V(z), the electric potential at any
point on the central axis. Because we have a circular distribution of charge on the
disk, we could start with a differential element that occupies angle du and radial
distance dr. We would then need to set up a two-dimensional integration.
However, let’s do something easier.
In Fig. 24-16, consider a differential element consisting of a flat ring of radius
R. and radial width dR.. Its charge has magnitude
dq $ s(2pR.)(dR.),
in which (2pR.)(dR.) is the upper surface area of the ring. All parts of this
charged element are the same distance r from point P on the disk’s axis.With the
aid of Fig. 24-16, we can use Eq. 24-31 to write the contribution of this ring to
the electric potential at P as
(24-36)
We find the net potential at P by adding (via integration) the contributions of all
the rings from R. $ 0 to R. $ R:
(24-37)
Note that the variable in the second integral of Eq. 24-37 is R. and not z, which
remains constant while the integration over the surface of the disk is carried out.
(Note also that, in evaluating the integral, we have assumed that z - 0.)
