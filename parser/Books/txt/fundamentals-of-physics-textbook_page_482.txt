The Wave Equation
As a wave passes through any element on a stretched string, the element moves
perpendicularly to the wave’s direction of travel (we are dealing with a trans-
verse wave). By applying Newton’s second law to the element’s motion, we can
derive a general differential equation, called the wave equation, that governs the
travel of waves of any type.
Figure 16-11a shows a snapshot of a string element of mass dm and length !
as a wave travels along a string of linear density m that is stretched along a hori-
zontal x axis. Let us assume that the wave amplitude is small so that the element
can be tilted only slightly from the x axis as the wave passes. The force 
2 on the
right end of the element has a magnitude equal to tension t in the string and is
directed slightly upward. The force 
1 on the left end of the element also has
a magnitude equal to the tension t but is directed slightly downward. Because of
the slight curvature of the element, these two forces are not simply in opposite di-
rection so that they cancel. Instead, they combine to produce a net force that
causes the element to have an upward acceleration ay. Newton’s second law writ-
ten for y components (Fnet,y # may) gives us
F2y $ F1y # dm ay.
(16-34)
Let’s analyze this equation in parts, first the mass dm, then the acceleration com-
ponent ay, then the individual force components F2y and F1y, and then finally the
net force that is on the left side of Eq. 16-34.
Mass. The element’s mass dm can be written in terms of the string’s linear
density m and the element’s length ! as dm # m!. Because the element can have
only a slight tilt, ! % dx (Fig. 16-11a) and we have the approximation

16.17 For the equation giving a string-element displacement
as a function of position x and time t, apply the relationship
between the second derivative with respect to x and the
second derivative with respect to t.

Here the waves travel along an x axis and oscillate parallel to
the y axis, and they move with speed v, in either the positive x
direction or the negative x direction.
