If we square each side of this relation, we obtain
(35-29)
Intensity. Now, from Eq. 33-24, we know that the intensity of an electromag-
netic wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude.Therefore, the waves we
are combining in Fig. 35-13b, whose amplitudes are E0, each has an intensity I0
that is proportional to 
, and the resultant wave, with amplitude E, has an inten-
sity I that is proportional to E 2.Thus,
Substituting Eq. 35-29 into this equation and rearranging then yield
which is Eq. 35-22, which we set out to prove.
We still must prove Eq. 35-23, which relates the phase difference f between
the waves arriving at any point P on the screen of Fig. 35-10 to the angle u that
serves as a locator of that point.
The phase difference f in Eq. 35-21 is associated with the path length differ-
ence S1b in Fig. 35-10b. If S1b is 
, then f is p; if S1b is l, then f is 2p, and so on.
This suggests
(35-30)
The path length difference S1b in Fig. 35-10b is d sin u (a leg of the right triangle);
so Eq. 35-30 for the phase difference between the two waves arriving at point P
on the screen becomes
which is Eq. 35-23, the other equation that we set out to prove to relate f to the
angle u that locates P.
Combining More Than Two Waves
In a more general case, we might want to find the resultant of more than two 
sinusoidally varying waves at a point. Whatever the number of waves is, our 
general procedure is this:
1. Construct a series of phasors representing the waves to be combined. Draw
them end to end, maintaining the proper phase relations between adjacent
phasors.
2. Construct the vector sum of this array. The length of this vector sum gives
the amplitude of the resultant phasor. The angle between the vector sum
and the first phasor is the phase of the resultant with respect to this first pha-
sor.The projection of this vector-sum phasor on the vertical axis gives the time
variation of the resultant wave.

INTERFERENCE
Checkpoint 4
Each of four pairs of light waves arrives at a certain point on a screen.The waves have
the same wavelength.At the arrival point, their amplitudes and phase differences are
(a) 2E0, 6E0, and p rad; (b) 3E0, 5E0, and p rad; (c) 9E0, 7E0, and 3p rad; (d) 2E0, 2E0,
and 0 rad. Rank the four pairs according to the intensity of the light at the arrival
point, greatest first. (Hint: Draw phasors.)
