14-7 BERNOULLI’S EQUATION
Figure 14-18 As water falls from a tap, its speed in-
creases. Because the volume flow rate must be the
same at all horizontal cross sections of the stream,
the stream must “neck down” (narrow).

... the volume flow
per second here.
KEY IDEA
The volume flow rate through the higher cross section must
be the same as that through the lower cross section.
Calculations: From Eq. 14-24, we have
A0v0 ! Av,
(14-26)
where v0 and v are the water speeds at the levels correspon-
ding to A0 and A. From Eq. 2-16 we can also write, because
the water is falling freely with acceleration g,
(14-27)
Eliminating v between Eqs. 14-26 and 14-27 and solving for
v0, we obtain
! 0.286 m/s ! 28.6 cm/s.
From Eq. 14-24, the volume flow rate RV is then
RV ! A0v0 ! (1.2 cm2)(28.6 cm/s)
! 34 cm3/s.

Sample Problem 14.05
A water stream narrows as it falls
Figure 14-18 shows how the stream of water emerging from a
faucet “necks down” as it falls. This change in the horizontal
cross-sectional area is characteristic of any laminar (non-
turbulant) falling stream because the gravitational force 
increases the speed of the stream. Here the indicated cross-
sectional areas are A0 ! 1.2 cm2 and A ! 0.35 cm2. The two
levels are separated by a vertical distance h ! 45 mm. What
is the volume flow rate from the tap?

Bernoulli’s Equation
Figure 14-19 represents a tube through which an ideal fluid is flowing at a steady
rate. In a time interval 't, suppose that a volume of fluid 'V, colored purple in
Fig. 14-19, enters the tube at the left (or input) end and an identical volume,
