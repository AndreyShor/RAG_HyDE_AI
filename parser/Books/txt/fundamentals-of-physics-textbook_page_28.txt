to exactly 1.0 m, is the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a certain
fraction of a second.We can define a unit and its standard in any way we care to.
However, the important thing is to do so in such a way that scientists around the
world will agree that our definitions are both sensible and practical.
Once we have set up a standard—say, for length—we must work out proce-
dures by which any length whatever, be it the radius of a hydrogen atom, the
wheelbase of a skateboard, or the distance to a star, can be expressed in terms of
the standard. Rulers, which approximate our length standard, give us one such
procedure for measuring length. However, many of our comparisons must be
indirect. You cannot use a ruler, for example, to measure the radius of an atom
or the distance to a star.
Base Quantities. There are so many physical quantities that it is a problem to
organize them. Fortunately, they are not all independent; for example, speed is the
ratio of a length to a time. Thus, what we do is pick out—by international agree-
ment—a small number of physical quantities, such as length and time, and assign
standards to them alone. We then define all other physical quantities in terms of
these base quantities and their standards (called base standards).Speed,for example,
is defined in terms of the base quantities length and time and their base standards.
Base standards must be both accessible and invariable. If we define the
length standard as the distance between one’s nose and the index finger on an
outstretched arm, we certainly have an accessible standard—but it will, of course,
vary from person to person.The demand for precision in science and engineering
pushes us to aim first for invariability. We then exert great effort to make dupli-
cates of the base standards that are accessible to those who need them.
The International System of Units
In 1971, the 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures picked seven
quantities as base quantities, thereby forming the basis of the International
System of Units, abbreviated SI from its French name and popularly known as
the metric system.Table 1-1 shows the units for the three base quantities—length,
mass, and time—that we use in the early chapters of this book. These units were
defined to be on a “human scale.”
Many SI derived units are defined in terms of these base units. For example,
the SI unit for power, called the watt (W), is defined in terms of the base units
for mass, length, and time.Thus, as you will see in Chapter 7,
1 watt " 1 W " 1 kg ! m2/s3,
(1-1)
where the last collection of unit symbols is read as kilogram-meter squared per
second cubed.
To express the very large and very small quantities we often run into in
physics, we use scientific notation, which employs powers of 10. In this notation,
3 560 000 000 m " 3.56 ' 109 m
(1-2)
and
0.000 000 492 s " 4.92 ' 10$7 s.
(1-3)
Scientific notation on computers sometimes takes on an even briefer look, as in
3.56 E9 and 4.92 E–7, where E stands for “exponent of ten.” It is briefer still on
some calculators, where E is replaced with an empty space.
As a further convenience when dealing with very large or very small mea-
surements, we use the prefixes listed in Table 1-2. As you can see, each prefix
represents a certain power of 10, to be used as a multiplication factor. Attaching
a prefix to an SI unit has the effect of multiplying by the associated factor. Thus,
we can express a particular electric power as
1.27 ' 109 watts " 1.27 gigawatts " 1.27 GW
