ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS AND ALTERNATING CURRENT
(for inductor), and in it the letter I (for current) comes after
the letter E (for emf or voltage). Thus, for an inductor, the
current lags (comes after) the voltage. Similarly, ICE (which
contains a C for capacitor) means that the current leads
(comes before) the voltage.You might also use the modified
mnemonic “ELI positively is the ICE man” to remember
that the phase constant f is positive for an inductor.
If you have difficulty in remembering whether XC is
equal to vdC (wrong) or 1/vdC (right), try remembering that
C is in the “cellar”—that is, in the denominator.
Problem-Solving Tactics
Leading and Lagging in AC Circuits: Table 31-2 summa-
rizes the relations between the current i and the voltage v
for each of the three kinds of circuit elements we have con-
sidered. When an applied alternating voltage produces an
alternating current in these elements, the current is always
in phase with the voltage across a resistor, always leads the
voltage across a capacitor, and always lags the voltage
across an inductor.
Many students remember these results with the
mnemonic “ELI the ICE man.” ELI contains the letter L

KEY IDEA
In an ac circuit with a purely inductive load, the alternating
current iL(t) in the inductance lags the alternating potential
difference vL(t) by 90°. (In the mnemonic of the problem-
solving tactic, this circuit is “positively an ELI circuit,”
which tells us that the emf E leads the current I and that f is
positive.)
Calculations: Because the phase constant f
for the 
current is $90°, or $p/2 rad, we can write Eq. 31-29 as
iL ! IL sin(vdt ' f) ! IL sin(vdt ' p/2).
(31-54)
We can find the amplitude IL from Eq. 31-52 (VL ! ILXL) if
we first find the inductive reactance XL. From Eq. 31-49 
(XL ! vdL), with vd ! 2pfd, we can write
Then Eq. 31-52 tells us that the current amplitude is
(Answer)
Substituting this and vd ! 2pfd ! 120p into Eq. 31-54, we
have
iL ! (0.415 A) sin(120pt ' p/2).

Sample Problem 31.05
Purely inductive load: potential difference and current
In Fig. 31-12, inductance L is 230 mH and the sinusoidal 
alternating emf device operates at amplitude #m ! 36.0 V
and frequency fd ! 60.0 Hz.
(a) What are the potential difference vL(t) across the induc-
tance and the amplitude VL of vL(t)?
KEY IDEA
In a circuit with a purely inductive load, the potential differ-
ence vL(t) across the inductance is always equal to the
potential difference #(t) across the emf device.
Calculations: Here we have vL(t) ! #(t) and VL ! #m.
Since #m is given, we know that
VL ! #m ! 36.0 V.
(Answer)
To find vL(t), we use Eq. 31-28 to write
vL(t) ! #(t) ! #m sin vdt.
(31-53)
Then, substituting #m ! 36.0 V and vd ! 2pfd ! 120p into
Eq. 31-53, we have
vL ! (36.0 V) sin(120pt).
(Answer)
(b) What are the current iL(t) in the circuit as a function of
time and the amplitude IL of iL(t)?
