A ton is a measure of volume frequently used in ship-
ping, but that use requires some care because there are at
least three types of tons: A displacement ton is equal to 7 barrels
bulk, a freight ton is equal to 8 barrels bulk, and a register ton is
equal to 20 barrels bulk. A barrel bulk is another measure of vol-
ume: 1 barrel bulk " 0.1415 m3. Suppose you spot a shipping order
for “73 tons” of M&M candies, and you are certain that the client
who sent the order intended “ton” to refer to volume (instead of
weight or mass, as discussed in Chapter 5). If the client actually
meant displacement tons, how many extra U.S. bushels of the can-
dies will you erroneously ship if you interpret the order as (a) 73
freight tons and (b) 73 register tons? (1 m3 " 28.378 U.S.
bushels.)

Two types of barrel units were in use in the 1920s in the
United States.The apple barrel had a legally set volume of 7056 cu-
bic inches; the cranberry barrel, 5826 cubic inches. If a merchant
sells 20 cranberry barrels of goods to a customer who thinks he is
receiving apple barrels, what is the discrepancy in the shipment
volume in liters?

An old English children’s rhyme states, “Little Miss Muffet
sat on a tuffet, eating her curds and whey, when along came a spi-
der who sat down beside her. . . .”The spider sat down not because
of the curds and whey but because Miss Muffet had a stash of 11
tuffets of dried flies. The volume measure of a tuffet is given by
1 tuffet " 2 pecks " 0.50 Imperial bushel, where 1 Imperial bushel
" 36.3687 liters (L). What was Miss Muffet’s stash in (a) pecks,
(b) Imperial bushels, and (c) liters?

Table 1-7 shows some old measures of liquid volume. To
complete the table, what numbers (to three significant figures)
should be entered in (a) the wey column, (b) the chaldron column,
(c) the bag column, (d) the pottle column, and (e) the gill column,
starting from the top down? (f) The volume of 1 bag is equal to
0.1091 m3. If an old story has a witch cooking up some vile liquid
in a cauldron of volume 1.5 chaldrons, what is the volume in cubic
meters?

A typical sugar cube has an edge length of 1 cm. If you had a
cubical box that contained a mole of sugar cubes, what would its
edge length be? (One mole " 6.02 ' 1023 units.)

An old manuscript reveals that a landowner in the time
of King Arthur held 3.00 acres of plowed land plus a live-
stock area of 25.0 perches by 4.00 perches. What was the total
area in (a) the old unit of roods and (b) the more modern unit of
square meters? Here, 1 acre is an area of 40 perches by 4 perches,
1 rood is an area of 40 perches by 1 perch, and 1 perch is the
length 16.5 ft.

A tourist purchases a car in England and ships it home to
the United States.The car sticker advertised that the car’s fuel con-
sumption was at the rate of 40 miles per gallon on the open road.

The tourist does not realize that the U.K. gallon differs from the
U.S. gallon:
1 U.K. gallon " 4.546 090 0 liters
1 U.S. gallon " 3.785 411 8 liters.
For a trip of 750 miles (in the United States), how many gallons of
fuel does (a) the mistaken tourist believe she needs and (b) the car
actually require?

Using conversions and data in the chapter, determine
the number of hydrogen atoms required to obtain 1.0 kg of
hydrogen.A hydrogen atom has a mass of 1.0 u.
41
A cord is a volume of cut wood equal to a stack 8 ft
long, 4 ft wide, and 4 ft high. How many cords are in 1.0 m3?
42
One molecule of water (H2O) contains two atoms of hydrogen
and one atom of oxygen.A hydrogen atom has a mass of 1.0 u and an
atom of oxygen has a mass of 16 u, approximately. (a) What is the
mass in kilograms of one molecule of water? (b) How many mole-
cules of water are in the world’s oceans,which have an estimated total
mass of 1.4 ' 1021 kg?
43
A person on a diet might lose 2.3 kg per week. Express the
mass loss rate in milligrams per second, as if the dieter could sense
the second-by-second loss.

What mass of water fell on the town in Problem 7? Water has
a density of 1.0 ' 103 kg/m3.

(a) A unit of time sometimes used in microscopic physics is
the shake. One shake equals 10$8 s. Are there more shakes in a
second than there are seconds in a year? (b) Humans have ex-
isted for about 106 years, whereas the universe is about 1010 years
old. If the age of the universe is defined as 1 “universe day,”
where a universe day consists of “universe seconds” as a normal
day consists of normal seconds, how many universe seconds have
humans existed?

A unit of area often used in measuring land areas is the hectare,
defined as 104 m2. An open-pit coal mine consumes 75 hectares of
land, down to a depth of 26 m, each year. What volume of earth, in
cubic kilometers,is removed in this time?
47
An astronomical unit (AU) is the average distance
between Earth and the Sun, approximately 1.50
108 km. The
speed of light is about 3.0 ' 108 m/s. Express the speed of light in
astronomical units per minute.
48
The common Eastern mole, a mammal, typically has a mass of
75 g, which corresponds to about 7.5 moles of atoms. (A mole of
atoms is 6.02 ' 1023 atoms.) In atomic mass units (u), what is the
average mass of the atoms in the common Eastern mole?
49
A traditional unit of length in Japan is the ken (1 ken "
1.97 m). What are the ratios of (a) square kens to square meters
and (b) cubic kens to cubic meters? What is the volume of a cylin-
drical water tank of height 5.50 kens and radius 3.00 kens in (c) cu-
bic kens and (d) cubic meters?

You receive orders to sail due east for 24.5 mi to put your sal-
vage ship directly over a sunken pirate ship. However, when your
divers probe the ocean floor at that location and find no evidence of
a ship,you radio back to your source of information,only to discover
that the sailing distance was supposed to be 24.5 nautical miles, not
regular miles. Use the Length table in Appendix D to calculate how
far horizontally you are from the pirate ship in kilometers.
