Interference and Double-Slit Intensity
•29
Two waves of the same frequency have amplitudes 1.00
and 2.00. They interfere at a point where their phase difference is
60.0°.What is the resultant amplitude?
•30
Find the sum y of the following quantities:
y1 ! 10 sin vt
and
y2 ! 8.0 sin(vt ' 30°).
••31
Add the quantities y1 ! 10 sin vt, y2 ! 15 sin(vt ' 30 ),
and y3
5.0 sin(vt
45 ) using the phasor method.
••32
In the double-slit experiment of Fig. 35-10, the electric
fields of the waves arriving at point P are given by
E1 ! (2.00 mV/m) sin[(1.26 ( 1015)t]
E2 ! (2.00 mV/m) sin[(1.26 ( 1015)t ' 39.6 rad],
where time t is in seconds. (a) What is the amplitude of the
resultant electric field at point P? (b) What is the ratio of the
intensity IP at point P to the intensity Icen at the center of the inter-
ference pattern? (c) Describe where point P is in the interference
pattern by giving the maximum or minimum on which it lies, or the
maximum and minimum between which it lies. In a phasor diagram
of the electric fields, (d) at what rate would the phasors rotate
around the origin and (e) what is the angle between the phasors?
••33
Three electromagnetic waves travel through a certain point
P along an x axis.They are polarized parallel to a y axis, with the fol-
lowing variations in their amplitudes.Find their resultant at P.
E1 ! (10.0 mV/m) sin[(2.0 ( 1014 rad/s)t]
E2 ! (5.00 mV/m) sin[(2.0 ( 1014 rad/s)t ' 45.0°]
E3 ! (5.00 mV/m) sin[(2.0 ( 1014 rad/s)t & 45.0°]
••34
In the double-slit experiment of Fig. 35-10, the viewing
screen is at distance D ! 4.00 m, point P lies at distance y ! 20.5
cm from the center of the pattern, the slit separation d is 4.50 mm,
and the wavelength l is 580 nm. (a) Determine where point P is in
the interference pattern by giving the maximum or minimum on
which it lies, or the maximum and minimum between which it lies.
(b) What is the ratio of the intensity IP at point P to the intensity
Icen at the center of the pattern?

Interference from Thin
Films
•35
We wish to coat flat glass (n !
1.50) with a transparent material (n
1.25)
so that reflection of light at wavelength 600
nm is eliminated by interference. What mini-
mum thickness can the coating have to do
this?
•36
A 600-nm-thick soap film (n ! 1.40) in
air is illuminated with white light in a direc-
tion perpendicular to the film. For how many
different wavelengths in the 300 to 700 nm
range is there (a) fully constructive interfer-
ence and (b) fully destructive interference in
the reflected light?
•37
The rhinestones in costume jewelry are
glass with index of refraction 1.50. To make
them more reflective, they are often coated

with a layer of silicon monoxide of index of refraction 2.00.What is
the minimum coating thickness needed to ensure that light of
wavelength 560 nm and of perpendicular incidence will be re-
flected from the two surfaces of the coating with fully constructive
interference?
•38
White light is sent downward onto a horizontal thin film that
is sandwiched between two materials. The indexes of refraction
are 1.80 for the top material, 1.70 for the thin film, and 1.50 for the
bottom material. The film thickness is 5.00 ( 10&7 m. Of the visi-
ble wavelengths (400 to 700 nm) that result in fully constructive
interference at an observer above the film, which is the (a) longer
and (b) shorter wavelength? The materials and film are then
heated so that the film thickness increases. (c) Does the light re-
sulting in fully constructive interference shift toward longer or
shorter wavelengths?
•39
Light of wavelength 624 nm is incident perpendicularly
on a soap film (n
1.33) suspended in air. What are the (a) least
and (b) second least thicknesses of the film for which the reflec-
tions from the film undergo fully constructive interference?
••40
A thin film of acetone (n
1.25) coats a thick glass plate 
(n ! 1.50). White light is incident normal to the film. In the reflec-
tions, fully destructive interference occurs at 600 nm and fully
constructive interference at 700 nm. Calculate the thickness of the
acetone film.

Reflection by thin layers. In Fig. 35-42,
light is incident perpendicularly on a thin
layer of material 2 that lies between
(thicker) materials 1 and 3. (The rays are
tilted only for clarity.) The waves of rays
r1 and r2 interfere, and here we consider
the type of interference to be either
maximum (max) or minimum (min). For
this situation, each problem in Table 35-
2 refers to the indexes of refraction n1, n2, and n3, the type of in-
terference, the thin-layer thickness L
in nanometers, and
the wavelength l in nanometers of the light as measured in air.
Where l is missing, give the wavelength that is in the visible
range. Where L is missing, give the second least thickness or the
third least thickness as indicated.
