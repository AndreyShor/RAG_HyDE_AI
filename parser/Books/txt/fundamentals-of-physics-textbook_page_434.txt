tical upstream face of a dam of
width W ! 314 m. Find (a) the net
horizontal force on the dam from
the gauge pressure of the water and
(b) the net torque due to that force
about a horizontal line through O
parallel to the (long) width of the dam.This torque tends to rotate the
dam around that line, which would cause the dam to fail. (c) Find the
moment arm of the torque.

In one observation, the column in a mercury barometer (as is

perature is %5.0(C, at which temperature the density of mercury r is

Pascal’s Principle

A piston of cross-sectional
area a is used in a hydraulic press to
exert a small force of magnitude f on
the enclosed liquid. A connecting
pipe leads to a larger piston of cross-
sectional area A (Fig.14-36).(a) What
force magnitude F will the larger pis-
ton sustain without moving? (b) If
the piston diameters are 3.80 cm and
53.0 cm, what force magnitude on the small piston will balance a 20.0
kN force on the large piston?

In Fig. 14-37, a spring of spring
constant 3.00 $ 104 N/m is between a
rigid beam and the output piston of a
hydraulic lever. An empty container
with negligible mass sits on the input
piston.The input piston has area Ai,and
the output piston has area 18.0Ai.
Initially the spring is at its rest length.
How many kilograms of sand must be
(slowly) poured into the container to compress the spring by 5.00 cm?

A 5.00 kg object is released from rest while fully submerged
in a liquid. The liquid displaced by the submerged object has a
mass of 3.00 kg. How far and in what direction does the object
move in 0.200 s, assuming that it moves freely and that the drag
force on it from the liquid is negligible?

downward force on the top of the

the cube using Archimedes’ principle. What relation exists among
all these quantities?

Two identical cylindrical ves-
sels with their bases at the same level each
contain a liquid of density 1.30 $ 103
kg/m3. The area of each base is 4.00 cm2,
but in one vessel the liquid height is 0.854
m and in the other it is 1.560 m. Find the
work done by the gravitational force in
equalizing the levels when the two vessels are connected.

g-LOC in dogfights.When a pilot takes a tight turn at high
speed in a modern fighter airplane, the blood pressure at the brain
level decreases, blood no longer perfuses the brain, and the blood in
the brain drains.If the heart maintains the (hydrostatic) gauge pressure
in the aorta at 120 torr (or mm Hg) when the pilot undergoes a hori-
zontal centripetal acceleration of 4g, what is the blood pressure (in
torr) at the brain, 30 cm radially inward from the heart? The perfusion
in the brain is small enough that the vision switches to black and white
and narrows to “tunnel vision” and the pilot can undergo g-LOC (“g-
induced loss of consciousness”).Blood density is

In analyzing certain geo-
logical features, it is often appro-
priate to assume that the pressure
at some horizontal level of com-
pensation, deep inside Earth, is the
same over a large region and is
equal to the pressure due to the
gravitational force on the overly-
ing material. Thus, the pressure on
the level of compensation is given
by the fluid pressure formula. This
model requires, for one thing, that
mountains have roots of continen-
tal rock extending into the denser
mantle (Fig. 14-34). Consider a mountain of height H ! 6.0 km
on a continent of thickness T ! 32 km. The continental rock has
a density of 2.9 g/cm3, and beneath this rock the mantle has a
density of 3.3 g/cm3. Calculate the depth D of the root. (Hint: Set
the pressure at points a and b equal; the depth y of the level of
compensation will cancel out.)
