This prediction of kinetic theory agrees well with experiment, not only for
monatomic gases but also for gases in general, as long as their density is low
enough so that we may treat them as ideal.

to find Q. To evaluate Cp we go to Eq. 19-49, which tells us
that for any ideal gas, Cp # CV " R. Then from Eq. 19-43, we
know that for any monatomic gas (like the helium here),
Thus, Eq. 19-50 gives us

Sample Problem 19.07
Monatomic gas, heat, internal energy, and work
A bubble of 5.00 mol of helium is submerged at a certain depth
in liquid water when the water (and thus the helium) undergoes
a temperature increase %T of 20.0 C- at constant pressure.As a
result, the bubble expands.The helium is monatomic and ideal.
(a) How much energy is added to the helium as heat during
the increase and expansion?
KEY IDEA
Heat Q is related to the temperature change %T by a molar
specific heat of the gas.
Calculations: Because the pressure p is held constant dur-
ing the addition of energy, we use the molar specific heat at
pressure process 
. Note that for the latter, the value of Q is higher
(Q # 5
2nR %T)
by the amount W, the work done by the gas in the expansion. Note also that for
the constant-volume process, the energy added as Q goes entirely into the change
in internal energy %Eint and for the constant-pressure process, the energy added
as Q goes into both %Eint and the work W.
