Combining this result with Eq. 26-7 
in magnitude form, yields
(26-20)
which we can write as
(26-21)
Comparing this with Eq. 26-11 
in magnitude form, leads to
(26-22)
Equation 26-22 may be taken as a statement that metals obey Ohm’s law if we
can show that, for metals, their resistivity r is a constant, independent of the
strength of the applied electric field 
Let’s consider the quantities in Eq. 26-22.
We can reasonably assume that n, the number of conduction electrons per vol-
ume, is independent of the field, and m and e are constants.Thus, we only need to
convince ourselves that t, the average time (or mean free time) between colli-
sions, is a constant, independent of the strength of the applied electric field.
Indeed, t can be considered to be a constant because the drift speed vd caused by
the field is so much smaller than the effective speed veff that the electron speed—
and thus t—is hardly affected by the field. Thus, because the right side of 
Eq. 26-22 is independent of the field magnitude, metals obey Ohm’s law.

26-4 OHM’S LAW
Using these results and substituting for the electron mass m,
we then have
(Answer)
(b) The mean free path l of the conduction electrons in a
conductor is the average distance traveled by an electron
between collisions. (This definition parallels that in
Module 19-5 for the mean free path of molecules in a gas.)
What is l for the conduction electrons in copper, assuming
that their effective speed veff is 1.6 $ 10 6 m/s?
KEY IDEA
The distance d any particle travels in a certain time t at a
constant speed v is d ! vt.
Calculation: For the electrons in copper, this gives us
(26-24)
(Answer)
This is about 150 times the distance between nearest-
neighbor atoms in a copper lattice. Thus, on the average,
each conduction electron passes many copper atoms before
finally hitting one.

Sample Problem 26.05
Mean free time and mean free distance
(a) What is the mean free time t between collisions for the
conduction electrons in copper?
KEY IDEAS
The mean free time t of copper is approximately constant,
and in particular does not depend on any electric field that
might be applied to a sample of the copper. Thus, we need
not consider any particular value of applied electric field.
However, because the resistivity r displayed by copper
under an electric field depends on t, we can find the mean
free time t from Eq. 26-22 (r ! m/e2nt).
Calculations: That equation gives us
(26-23)
The number of conduction electrons per unit volume in cop-
per is 8.49 $ 1028 m#3.We take the value of r from Table 26-1.
