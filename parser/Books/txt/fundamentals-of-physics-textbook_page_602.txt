CHAPTER 19
THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES
1
For four situations for an
ideal gas, the table gives the
energy transferred to or from
the gas as heat Q and either the
work W done by the gas or the
work Won done on the gas, all in
joules. Rank the four situations in terms of the temperature change
of the gas, most positive first.

Ideal Gas
An ideal gas is one for which the pressure p, volume
V, and temperature T are related by
pV # nRT
(ideal gas law).
(19-5)
Here n is the number of moles of the gas present and R is a constant
(8.31 J/mol9K) called the gas constant. The ideal gas law can also be
written as
pV # NkT,
(19-9)
where the Boltzmann constant k is
(19-7)
Work in an Isothermal Volume Change
The work done
by an ideal gas during an isothermal (constant-temperature)
change from volume Vi to volume Vf is
(ideal gas, isothermal process).
(19-14)
Pressure, Temperature, and Molecular Speed
The pres-
sure exerted by n moles of an ideal gas, in terms of the speed of its
molecules,is
(19-21)
where 
is the root-mean-square speed of the mole-
cules of the gas.With Eq. 19-5 this gives
(19-22)
Temperature and Kinetic Energy
The average transla-
tional kinetic energy Kavg per molecule of an ideal gas is
(19-24)
Mean Free Path
The mean free path l of a gas molecule is its
average path length between collisions and is given by
(19-25)
where N/V is the number of molecules per unit volume and d is the
molecular diameter.
Maxwell Speed Distribution
The Maxwell speed distri-
bution P(v) is a function such that P(v) dv gives the fraction
of molecules with speeds in the interval dv at speed v:

and the rms speed defined above in Eq. 19-22.
Molar Specific Heats
The molar specific heat CV of a gas at
constant volume is defined as
(19-39, 19-41)
in which Q is the energy transferred as heat to or from a sample of
n moles of the gas, %T is the resulting temperature change of the
gas, and %Eint is the resulting change in the internal energy of the
gas. For an ideal monatomic gas,
(19-43)
The molar specific heat Cp of a gas at constant pressure is defined to be
(19-46)
in which Q, n, and %T are defined as above. Cp is also given by
Cp # CV " R.
(19-49)
For n moles of an ideal gas,
Eint # nCVT
(ideal gas).
(19-44)
If n moles of a confined ideal gas undergo a temperature change %T
due to any process,the change in the internal energy of the gas is
%Eint # nCV %T
(ideal gas, any process).
(19-45)
Degrees of Freedom and CV
The equipartition of energy
theorem states that every degree of freedom of a molecule has an
energy 
per molecule (
per mole). If f is the number of
degrees of freedom, then Eint

For monatomic gases f # 3 (three translational degrees); for di-
atomic gases f # 5 (three translational and two rotational degrees).
