35.6 kN. (a) What is the weight of the water this boat displaces
when floating in salt water of density 1.10 $ 103 kg/m3? (b) What is
the difference between the volume of fresh water displaced and
the volume of salt water displaced?

Three children, each of weight 356 N,
make a log raft by lashing together logs of
diameter 0.30 m and length 1.80 m. How
many logs will be needed to keep them
afloat in fresh water? Take the den-
sity of the logs to be 800 kg/m3.

In Fig. 14-39a, a rectan-
gular block is gradually pushed
face-down into a liquid. The block
has height d; on the bottom and
top the face area is A ! 5.67 cm2.
Figure 14-39b gives the apparent
weight Wapp of the block as a func-
tion of the depth h of its lower
face. The scale on the vertical axis
is set by Ws ! 0.20 N. What is the
density of the liquid?
••37
A hollow spherical iron shell floats almost completely sub-
merged in water.The outer diameter is 60.0 cm,and the density of iron
is 7.87 g/cm3. Find the inner diameter.
••38
A small solid ball is 
released from rest while fully sub-
merged in a liquid and then its kinetic
energy is measured when it has moved
4.0 cm in the liquid. Figure 14-40 gives
the results after many liquids are used:
The kinetic energy K is plotted versus
the liquid density rliq, and Ks ! 1.60 J
sets the scale on the vertical axis.
What are (a) the density and (b) the volume of the ball?
••39
A hollow sphere of inner radius 8.0 cm and outer
radius 9.0 cm floats half-submerged in a liquid of density 800 kg/m3.
(a) What is the mass of the sphere? (b) Calculate the density of the
material of which the sphere is made.

Lurking alligators.An al-
ligator waits for prey by floating with
only the top of its head exposed, so
that the prey cannot easily see it.
One way it can adjust the extent of
sinking is by controlling the size of its
lungs. Another way may be by swallowing stones (gastrolithes) that
then reside in the stomach. Figure 14-41 shows a highly simplified
model (a “rhombohedron gater”) of mass 130 kg that roams with its
head partially exposed.The top head surface has area 0.20 m2. If the
alligator were to swallow stones with a total mass of 1.0% of its body
mass (a typical amount),how far would it sink?
••41
What fraction of the volume of an iceberg (density 917 kg/m3)
would be visible if the iceberg floats (a) in the ocean (salt water,den-
sity 1024 kg/m3) and (b) in a river (fresh water, density 1000 kg/m3)?
(When salt water freezes to form ice, the salt is excluded. So, an ice-
berg could provide fresh water to a community.)

A flotation device is in the shape of a right cylinder, with a
height of 0.500 m and a face area of 4.00 m2 on top and bottom, and
its density is 0.400 times that of fresh water. It is initially held fully
submerged in fresh water, with its top face at the water surface.Then

work does the buoyant force do on the device during the ascent?

When researchers find a rea-
sonably complete fossil of a di-
nosaur, they can determine the mass
and weight of the living dinosaur
with a scale model sculpted from
plastic and based on the dimensions
of the fossil bones. The scale of the
model is 1/20; that is, lengths are 1/20
actual length, areas are (1/20)2 actual
areas, and volumes are (1/20)3 actual
volumes. First, the model is suspended from one arm of a balance
and weights are added to the other arm until equilibrium is
reached. Then the model is fully submerged in water and enough
weights are removed from the second arm to reestablish equilib-
rium (Fig. 14-42). For a model of a particular T. rex fossil, 637.76 g
had to be removed to reestablish equilibrium. What was the vol-
ume of (a) the model and (b) the actual T. rex? (c) If the density of
T. rex was approximately the density of water, what was its mass?

A wood block (mass 3.67 kg, density 600 kg/m3) is  fitted
with lead (density 1.14 $ 104 kg/m3) so that it floats in water with
0.900 of its volume submerged. Find the lead mass if the lead is fit-
ted to the block’s (a) top and (b) bottom.

An iron casting containing a number of cavities weighs
6000 N in air and 4000 N in water. What is the total cavity volume
in the casting? The density of solid iron is 7.87 g/cm3.

Suppose that you release a small ball from rest at a depth
of 0.600 m below the surface in a pool of water. If the density of the
ball is 0.300 that of water and if the drag force on the ball from the
water is negligible, how high above the water surface will the ball
shoot as it emerges from the water? (Neglect any transfer of en-
ergy to the splashing and waves produced by the emerging ball.)

The volume of air space in the passenger compartment of an
1800 kg car is 5.00 m3. The volume of the motor and front wheels is
0.750 m3,and the volume of the rear wheels,gas tank,and trunk is 0.800
m3; water cannot enter these two regions.The car rolls into a lake. (a)
At first,no water enters the passenger compartment.How much of the
car, in cubic meters, is below the water surface with the car floating
(Fig.14-43)? (b) As water slowly enters,the car sinks.How many cubic
meters of water are in the car as it disappears below the water surface?
(The car,with a heavy load in the trunk,remains horizontal.)

Figure 14-44 shows an iron ball suspended by thread of
negligible mass from an upright cylinder that
floats partially submerged in water. The cylin-
der has a height of 6.00 cm, a face area of 12.0
cm2 on the top and bottom, and a density of
0.30 g/cm3, and 2.00 cm of its height is above
the water surface.What is the radius of the iron
ball?
