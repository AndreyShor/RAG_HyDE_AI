Energy Transport and the Poynting Vector
All sunbathers know that an electromagnetic wave can transport energy and
deliver it to a body on which the wave falls.The rate of energy transport per unit
area in such a wave is described by a vector , called the Poynting vector after
physicist John Henry Poynting (1852–1914), who first discussed its properties.
This vector is defined as
(Poynting vector).
(33-19)
Its magnitude S is related to the rate at which energy is transported by a wave
across a unit area at any instant (inst):
(33-20)
From this we can see that the SI unit for 
is the watt per square meter (W/m2).

33-2 ENERGY TRANSPORT AND THE POYNTING VECTOR
The direction of the Poynting vector 
of an electromagnetic wave at any
point gives the wave’s direction of travel and the direction of energy transport
at that point.

Because 
and 
are perpendicular to each other in an electromagnetic
wave, the magnitude of 
is EB.Then the magnitude of 
is
(33-21)
in which S, E, and B are instantaneous values. The magnitudes E and B are so
closely coupled to each other that we need to deal with only one of them; we
choose E, largely because most instruments for detecting electromagnetic waves
deal with the electric component of the wave rather than the magnetic compo-
nent. Using B ! E/c from Eq. 33-5, we can rewrite Eq. 33-21 in terms of just the
electric component as
(instantaneous energy flow rate).

Intensity. By substituting E ! Em sin(kx ' vt) into Eq. 33-22, we could ob-
tain an equation for the energy transport rate as a function of time. More useful
in practice, however, is the average energy transported over time; for that,
we need to find the time-averaged value of S, written Savg and also called the
intensity I of the wave.Thus from Eq. 33-20, the intensity I is
(33-23)
From Eq. 33-22, we find

Over a full cycle, the average value of sin2 u, for any angular variable u, is (see
Fig. 31-17). In addition, we define a new quantity Erms, the root-mean-square
value of the electric field, as
