THE    PRINCIPLE    OF    RELATIVITY    (IN    THE 
RESTRICTED  SENSE) 
IN  
order  to  attain  the  greatest  possible  clearness, 
let  us  return  to  our  example  of  the  railway  carriage 
supposed  to  be  travelling  uniformly.  We  call  its 
motion  a  uniform  translation  ("  uniform  "  because 
it  is  of  constant  velocity  and  direction,  "  translation  " 
because  although  the  carriage  changes  its  position 
relative  to  the  embankment  yet  it  does  not  rotate 
in  so  doing).  Let  us  imagine  a  raven  flying  through 
the  air  in  such  a  manner  that  its  motion,  as  observed 
from  the  embankment,  is  uniform  and  in  a  straight 
line.  If  we  were  to  observe  the  flying  raven  from 
the  moving  railway  carriage,  we  should  find  that  the 
motion  of  the  raven  would  be  one  of  different  velo 
city  and  direction,  but  that  it  would  still  be  uniform 
and  in  a  straight  line.  Expressed  in  an  abstract 
manner  we  may  say  :  If  a  mass  m  is  moving  uni 
formly  in  a  straight  line  with  respect  to  a  co-ordinate 
system  K,  then  it  will  also  be  moving  uniformly  and  in  a 
straight  line  relative  to  a  second  co-ordinate  system 
K',  provided  that  the  latter  is  executing  a  uniform 
translatory  motion  with  respect  to  K.  In  accordance 
with  the  discussion  contained  in  the  preceding  section, 
it  follows  that  :
