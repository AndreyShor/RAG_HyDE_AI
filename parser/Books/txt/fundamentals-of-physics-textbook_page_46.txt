Acceleration
When a particle’s velocity changes, the particle is said to undergo acceleration (or
to accelerate). For motion along an axis, the average acceleration aavg over a time
interval -t is
(2-7)
where the particle has velocity v1 at time t1 and then velocity v2 at time t2. The
instantaneous acceleration (or simply acceleration) is
(2-8)
In words, the acceleration of a particle at any instant is the rate at which its velocity
is changing at that instant. Graphically, the acceleration at any point is the slope of
the curve of v(t) at that point.We can combine Eq.2-8 with Eq.2-4 to write
(2-9)
In words, the acceleration of a particle at any instant is the second derivative of
its position x(t) with respect to time.
A common unit of acceleration is the meter per second per second: m/(s ! s)
or m/s2. Other units are in the form of length/(time ! time) or length/time2.
Acceleration has both magnitude and direction (it is yet another vector quan-
tity). Its algebraic sign represents its direction on an axis just as for displacement
and velocity; that is, acceleration with a positive value is in the positive direction
of an axis, and acceleration with a negative value is in the negative direction.
Figure 2-6 gives plots of the position, velocity, and acceleration of an ele-
vator moving up a shaft. Compare the a(t) curve with the v(t) curve—each
point on the a(t) curve shows the derivative (slope) of the v(t) curve at the
corresponding time. When v is constant (at either 0 or 4 m/s), the derivative is
zero and so also is the acceleration. When the cab first begins to move, the v(t)

2.12 Given a graph of a particle’s velocity versus time, deter-
mine the instantaneous acceleration for any particular time
and the average acceleration between any two particular
times.
●Average acceleration is the ratio of a change in velocity -v
to the time interval -t in which the change occurs:
