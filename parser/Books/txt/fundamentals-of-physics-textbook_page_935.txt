31-1 LC OSCILLATIONS
Canceling Q cos(vt $ f) and rearranging lead to
Thus, Eq. 31-12 is indeed a solution of Eq. 31-11 if v has the constant value
. Note that this expression for v is exactly that given by Eq. 31-4.
The phase constant f in Eq. 31-12 is determined by the conditions that exist
at any certain timeâ€”say, t ! 0. If the conditions yield f ! 0 at t ! 0, Eq. 31-12
requires that q ! Q and Eq. 31-13 requires that i ! 0; these are the initial con-
ditions represented by Fig. 31-1a.
Electrical and Magnetic Energy Oscillations
The electrical energy stored in the LC circuit at time t is, from Eqs. 31-1 and 31-12,
(31-16)
The magnetic energy is, from Eqs. 31-2 and 31-13,
Substituting for v from Eq. 31-4 then gives us
(31-17)
Figure 31-4 shows plots of UE(t) and UB(t) for the case of f ! 0. Note that
1. The maximum values of UE and UB are both Q2/2C.
2. At any instant the sum of UE and UB is equal to Q2/2C, a constant.
3. When UE is maximum, UB is zero, and conversely.

Checkpoint 2
A capacitor in an LC oscillator has a maximum potential difference of 17 V and a
maximum energy of 160 mJ.When the capacitor has a potential difference of 5 V and
an energy of 10 mJ, what are (a) the emf across the inductor and (b) the energy stored
in the magnetic field?
Calculations: At any time t during the oscillations, the loop
rule and Fig. 31-1 give us
vL(t) ! vC(t);
(31-18)
that is, the potential difference vL across the inductor must
always be equal to the potential difference vC across the
capacitor, so that the net potential difference around the
circuit is zero. Thus, we will find vL(t) if we can find vC(t),
and we can find vC(t) from q(t) with Eq. 25-1 (q ! CV).
Because the potential difference vC(t) is maximum
when the oscillations begin at time t ! 0, the charge q on the
capacitor must also be maximum then. Thus, phase constant
f must be zero; so Eq. 31-12 gives us
q ! Q cos vt.

Sample Problem 31.01
LC oscillator: potential change, rate of current change
A 1.5 mF capacitor is charged to 57 V by a battery, which is
then removed.At time t ! 0, a 12 mH coil is connected in se-
ries with the capacitor to form an LC oscillator (Fig. 31-1).
(a) What is the potential difference vL(t) across the inductor
as a function of time?
KEY IDEAS
(1) The current and potential differences of the circuit (both
the potential difference of the capacitor and the potential
difference of the coil) undergo sinusoidal oscillations.
(2) We can still apply the loop rule to these oscillating
potential differences, just as we did for the nonoscillating
circuits of Chapter 27.
