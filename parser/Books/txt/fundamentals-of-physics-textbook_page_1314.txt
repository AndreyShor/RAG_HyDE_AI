Checkpoint 2
The nuclide 131I is radioactive,with a half-life of 8.04 days.At noon on January 1,the ac-
tivity of a certain sample is 600 Bq.Using the concept of half-life,without written calcu-
lation,determine whether the activity at noon on January 24 will be a little less than 200
Bq,a little more than 200 Bq,a little less than 75 Bq,or a little more than 75 Bq.
should get a straight line. Further, the slope of the line
should be equal to #l.
Figure 42-9 shows a plot of ln R versus time t for the
given measurements. The slope of the straight line that fits
through the plotted points is
Thus,

l ! 0.0276 min#1 % 1.7 h#1.
(Answer)
The time for the decay rate R to decrease by 1/2 is re-
lated to the disintegration constant l via Eq. 42-18 (T1/2 !
(ln 2)/l). From that equation, we find

The table that follows shows some measurements of the
decay rate of a sample of 128I, a radionuclide often used
medically as a tracer to measure the rate at which iodine is
absorbed by the thyroid gland.

Find the disintegration constant l and the half-life T1/2 for
this radionuclide.
KEY IDEAS
The disintegration constant l determines the exponential rate
at which the decay rate R decreases with time t (as indicated by
Eq. 42-16, R ! R0e#lt). Therefore, we should be able to deter-
mine l by plotting the measurements of R against the mea-
surement times t.However,obtaining l from a plot of R versus
t is difficult because R decreases exponentially with t,according
to Eq. 42-16. A neat solution is to transform Eq. 42-16 into a
linear function of t, so that we can easily find l. To do so, we
take the natural logarithms of both sides of Eq.42-16.
Calculations: We obtain
(42-19)
Because Eq. 42-19 is of the form y ! b ' mx, with b and m
constants, it is a linear equation giving the quantity ln R as a
function of t.Thus, if we plot ln R (instead of R) versus t, we
