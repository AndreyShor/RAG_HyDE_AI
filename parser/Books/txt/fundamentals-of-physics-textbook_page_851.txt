The Magnetic Dipole Moment
As we have just discussed, a torque acts to rotate a current-carrying coil placed in
a magnetic field. In that sense, the coil behaves like a bar magnet placed in the
magnetic field.Thus, like a bar magnet, a current-carrying coil is said to be a mag-
netic dipole. Moreover, to account for the torque on the coil due to the magnetic
field, we assign a magnetic dipole moment
to the coil.The direction of 
is that
of the normal vector 
to the plane of the coil and thus is given by the same right-
hand rule shown in Fig. 28-19.That is, grasp the coil with the fingers of your right
hand in the direction of current i; the outstretched thumb of that hand gives the
direction of .The magnitude of 
is given by
m ! NiA
(magnetic moment),
(28-35)
in which N is the number of turns in the coil, i is the current through the coil, and
A is the area enclosed by each turn of the coil. From this equation, with i in
amperes and A in square meters, we see that the unit of 
is the ampere–square
meter (A!m2).
Torque. Using , we can rewrite Eq. 28-33 for the torque on the coil due to a
magnetic field as
t ! mB sin u,
(28-36)
in which u is the angle between the vectors 
and .
We can generalize this to the vector relation
(28-37)
which reminds us very much of the corresponding equation for the torque
exerted by an electric field on an electric dipole—namely, Eq. 22-34:
In each case the torque due to the field—either magnetic or electric—is equal to
the vector product of the corresponding dipole moment and the field vector.
Energy. A magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field has an energy that
depends on the dipole’s orientation in the field. For electric dipoles we have
shown (Eq. 22-38) that
In strict analogy, we can write for the magnetic case
(28-38)
In each case the energy due to the field is equal to the negative of the scalar prod-
uct of the corresponding dipole moment and the field vector.
A magnetic dipole has its lowest energy (! %mB cos 0 ! %mB) when its di-
pole moment 
is lined up with the magnetic field (Fig. 28-20). It has its highest
energy (
mB cos 180
mB) when 
is directed opposite the field. From 
Eq. 28-38, with U in joules and 
in teslas, we see that the unit of 
can be the
joule per tesla (J/T) instead of the ampere–square meter as suggested by 
Eq. 28-35.
Work. If an applied torque (due to “an external agent”) rotates a magnetic
dipole from an initial orientation ui to another orientation uf, then work Wa is
done on the dipole by the applied torque. If the dipole is stationary before and
after the change in its orientation, then work Wa is
Wa ! Uf % Ui,
(28-39)
where Uf and Ui are calculated with Eq. 28-38.
