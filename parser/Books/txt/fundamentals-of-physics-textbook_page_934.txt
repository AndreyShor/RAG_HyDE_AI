ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS AND ALTERNATING CURRENT
in which X is the amplitude of the mechanical oscillations (xm in Chapter 15), v is
the angular frequency of the oscillations, and f is a phase constant.
The LC Oscillator
Now let us analyze the oscillations of a resistanceless LC circuit, proceeding
exactly as we just did for the blockâ€“spring oscillator. The total energy U present
at any instant in an oscillating LC circuit is given by
(31-9)
in which UB is the energy stored in the magnetic field of the inductor and UE is the
energy stored in the electric field of the capacitor. Since we have assumed the cir-
cuit resistance to be zero,no energy is transferred to thermal energy and U remains
constant with time.In more formal language,dU/dt must be zero.This leads to
(31-10)
However, i ! dq/dt and di/dt ! d2q/dt2. With these substitutions, Eq. 31-10 becomes
(LC oscillations).
(31-11)
This is the differential equation that describes the oscillations of a resistanceless
LC circuit. Equations 31-11 and 31-7 are exactly of the same mathematical form.
Charge and Current Oscillations
Since the differential equations are mathematically identical, their solutions must
also be mathematically identical. Because q corresponds to x, we can write the
general solution of Eq. 31-11, by analogy to Eq. 31-8, as
q ! Q cos(vt $ f)
(charge),
(31-12)
where Q is the amplitude of the charge variations, v is the angular frequency of
the electromagnetic oscillations, and f is the phase constant. Taking the first de-
rivative of Eq. 31-12 with respect to time gives us the current:
(current).
(31-13)
The amplitude I of this sinusoidally varying current is
I ! vQ,
(31-14)
and so we can rewrite Eq. 31-13 as
i ! 'I sin(vt $ f).
(31-15)
Angular Frequencies
We can test whether Eq. 31-12 is a solution of Eq. 31-11 by substituting Eq. 31-12
and its second derivative with respect to time into Eq. 31-11. The first derivative
of Eq. 31-12 is Eq. 31-13. The second derivative is then
Substituting for q and d 2q/dt2 in Eq. 31-11, we obtain
