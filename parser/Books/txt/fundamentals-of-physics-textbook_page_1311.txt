42-2 SOME NUCLEAR PROPERTIES
The radius r is given by Eq. 42-3 (r
r0A1/3), where r0 is
1.2 fm (! 1.2 " 10#15 m). Substituting for r then leads to
Note that A has canceled out; thus, this equation for density
r applies to any nucleus that can be treated as spherical with
a radius given by Eq. 42-3. Using 1.67 " 10#27 kg for the
mass m of a nucleon, we then have

This is about 2 " 1014 times the density of water and is the
density of neutron stars, which contain only neutrons.

Sample Problem 42.03
Density of nuclear matter
We can think of all nuclides as made up of a neutron–
proton mixture that we can call nuclear matter. What is the
density of nuclear matter?
KEY IDEA
We can find the (average) density r of a nucleus by dividing
its total mass by its volume.
Calculations: Let m represent the mass of a nucleon (either a
proton or a neutron, because those particles have about the
same mass).Then the mass of a nucleus containing A nucleons is
Am.Next,we assume the nucleus is spherical with radius r.Then
its volume is 
and we can write the density of the nucleus as
r ! Am

must also add 50 electrons on the right side to balance
Eq. 42-9. Those 50 electrons can be combined with the 50
protons, to form 50 neutral hydrogen atoms.We then have
(42-10)
From the mass column of Table 42-1, the mass MSn of a 120Sn
atom is 119.902 197 u and the mass mH of a hydrogen atom
is 1.007 825 u; the mass mn of a neutron is 1.008 665 u. Thus,
Eq. 42-7 yields
where Eq. 42-5 (c 2 ! 931.494 013 MeV/u) provides an easy
unit conversion. Note that using atomic masses instead of
nuclear masses does not affect the result because the mass
of the 50 electrons in the 120Sn atom subtracts out from the
mass of the electrons in the 50 hydrogen atoms.
Now Eq. 42-8 gives us the binding energy per nucleon as

Sample Problem 42.02
Binding energy per nucleon
What is the binding energy per nucleon for 120Sn?
KEY IDEAS
1.
We can find the binding energy per nucleon )Eben if we
first find the binding energy )Ebe and then divide by
the number of nucleons A in the nucleus, according to
Eq. 42-8 ()Eben ! )Ebe/A).
2.
We can find )Ebe by finding the difference between the
mass energy Mc 2 of the nucleus and the total mass en-
ergy '(mc 2) of the individual nucleons that make up the
nucleus, according to Eq. 42-7 ()Ebe ! '(mc 2) # Mc 2).
Calculations: From Table 42-1, we see that a 120Sn nucleus
consists of 50 protons (Z ! 50) and 70 neutrons (N !
A # Z ! 120 # 50 ! 70). Thus, we need to imagine a 120Sn
nucleus being separated into its 50 protons and 70 neutrons,
(42-9)
and then compute the resulting change in mass energy.
For that computation, we need the masses of a 120Sn nu-
cleus, a proton, and a neutron. However, because the mass
of a neutral atom (nucleus plus electrons) is much easier to
measure than the mass of a bare nucleus, calculations of
binding energies are traditionally done with atomic masses.
Thus, let’s modify Eq. 42-9 so that it has a neutral 120Sn atom
on the left side. To do that, we include 50 electrons on the
left side (to match the 50 protons in the 120Sn nucleus). We
