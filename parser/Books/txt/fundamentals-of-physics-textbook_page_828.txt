The following table gives the
electric 
potential 
difference 
VT
across the terminals of a battery as a
function of current i being drawn
from the battery. (a) Write an equation that represents the rela-
tionship between VT and i. Enter the data into your graphing calcu-
lator and perform a linear regression fit of VT versus i. From the
parameters of the fit, find (b) the battery’s emf and (c) its internal
resistance.

A three-way 120 V lamp bulb that contains two filaments is
rated for 100-200-300 W. One filament burns out. Afterward, the
bulb operates at the same intensity (dissipates energy at the same
rate) on its lowest as on its highest switch positions but does not
operate at all on the middle position. (a) How are the two fila-
ments wired to the three switch positions? What are the (b) smaller
and (c) larger values of the filament resistances?

#1 ! 16 V and #2 ! 8.0 V. What are the (a) size and (b) direction
(up or down) of current i1 and the (c) size and (d) direction of
current i2? What is the energy transfer rate in (e) battery 1 and
(f) battery 2? Is energy being supplied or absorbed in (g) battery 1
and (h) battery 2?

A 120 V power line is protected by a 15 A fuse. What is the
maximum number of 500 W lamps that can be simultaneously op-
erated in parallel on this line without “blowing” the fuse because
of an excess of current?

through the resistor when the charge on the capacitor is 8.0 mC?

A group of N identical batteries of emf # and internal re-

allel (Fig. 27-80b) and then across a resistor R. Show that both
arrangements give the same current in R if R ! r.
