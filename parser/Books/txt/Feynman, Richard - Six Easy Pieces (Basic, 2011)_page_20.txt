SPECIAL PREFACE
(from The Feynman Lectures on Physics)
Toward the end of his life, Richard Feynman’s fame had tran-
scended the conﬁnes of the scientiﬁc community. His exploits as a
member of the commission investigating the space shuttle Chal-
lenger disaster gave him widespread exposure; similarly, a best-selling
book about his picaresque adventures made him a folk hero almost
of the proportions of Albert Einstein. But back in 1961, even before
his Nobel Prize increased his visibility to the general public, Feyn-
man was more than merely famous among members of the scientiﬁc
community—he was legendary. Undoubtedly, the extraordinary
power of his teaching helped spread and enrich the legend of
Richard Feynman.
He was a truly great teacher, perhaps the greatest of his era and
ours. For Feynman, the lecture hall was a theater, and the lecturer
a performer, responsible for providing drama and ﬁreworks as well
as facts and ﬁgures. He would prowl about the front of a classroom,
arms waving, “the impossible combination of theoretical physicist
and circus barker, all body motion and sound effects,” wrote The
New York Times. Whether he addressed an audience of students,
colleagues, or the general public, for those lucky enough to see
Feynman lecture in person, the experience was usually unconven-
tional and always unforgettable, like the man himself.
He was the master of high drama, adept at riveting the attention
of every lecture-hall audience. Many years ago, he taught a course
in Advanced Quantum Mechanics, a large class comprised of a few
