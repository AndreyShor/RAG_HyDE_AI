To do so, we rewrite Eq. 9-63 as
m1(v1i % v1f) ! m2v2f
(9-65)
and Eq. 9-64 as*
(9-66)
After dividing Eq. 9-66 by Eq. 9-65 and doing some more algebra, we obtain
(9-67)
and
(9-68)
Note that v2f is always positive (the initially stationary target body with mass m2
always moves forward). From Eq. 9-67 we see that v1f may be of either sign (the
projectile body with mass m1 moves forward if m1 - m2 but rebounds if m1 + m2).
Let us look at a few special situations.
1. Equal masses
If m1 ! m2, Eqs. 9-67 and 9-68 reduce to
v1f ! 0
and
v2f ! v1i,
which we might call a pool playerâ€™s result. It predicts that after a head-on colli-
sion of bodies with equal masses, body 1 (initially moving) stops dead in its
tracks and body 2 (initially at rest) takes off with the initial speed of body 1. In
head-on collisions, bodies of equal mass simply exchange velocities. This is
true even if body 2 is not initially at rest.
2. A massive target
In Fig. 9-18, a massive target means that m2
m1. For
example, we might fire a golf ball at a stationary cannonball. Equations 9-67
and 9-68 then reduce to
(9-69)
This tells us that body 1 (the golf ball) simply bounces back along its incom-
ing path, its speed essentially unchanged. Initially stationary body 2 (the
cannonball) moves forward at a low speed, because the quantity in paren-
theses in Eq. 9-69 is much less than unity.All this is what we should expect.
3. A massive projectile
This is the opposite case; that is, m1
m2. This time, we
fire a cannonball at a stationary golf ball.Equations 9-67 and 9-68 reduce to
v1f % v1i
and
v2f % 2v1i.
(9-70)
Equation 9-70 tells us that body 1 (the cannonball) simply keeps on going,
scarcely slowed by the collision. Body 2 (the golf ball) charges ahead at twice
the speed of the cannonball. Why twice the speed? Recall the collision de-
scribed by Eq. 9-69, in which the velocity of the incident light body (the golf
ball) changed from &v to %v, a velocity change of 2v. The same change in ve-
locity (but now from zero to 2v) occurs in this example also.
Moving Target
Now that we have examined the elastic collision of a projectile and a stationary
target, let us examine the situation in which both bodies are moving before they
undergo an elastic collision.
For the situation of Fig. 9-19, the conservation of linear momentum is written as
m1v1i & m2v2i ! m1v1f & m2v2f,

CHAPTER 9
CENTER OF MASS AND LINEAR MOMENTUM
*In this step, we use the identity a2 % b2 ! (a % b)(a & b). It reduces the amount of algebra needed to
solve the simultaneous equations Eqs. 9-65 and 9-66.
