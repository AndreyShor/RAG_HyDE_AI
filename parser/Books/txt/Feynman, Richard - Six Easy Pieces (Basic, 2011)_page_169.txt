detector up and down in the x-direction about the distance from a
maximum to its nearest minimum. Such a random shift is just
enough to smear out the pattern so that no interference is observed.
The uncertainty principle “protects” quantum mechanics.
Heisenberg recognized that if it were possible to measure the mo-
mentum and the position simultaneously with a greater accuracy,
the quantum mechanics would collapse. So he proposed that it
must be impossible. Then people sat down and tried to ﬁgure out
ways of doing it, and nobody could ﬁgure out a way to measure
the position and the momentum of anything—a screen, an elec-
tron, a billiard ball, anything—with any greater accuracy. Quantum
mechanics maintains its perilous but accurate existence.
