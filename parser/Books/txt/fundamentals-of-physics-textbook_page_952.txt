(Answer)
(b) What is the phase constant f of the current in the 
circuit relative to the driving emf?
KEY IDEA
The phase constant depends on the inductive reactance, the
capacitive reactance, and the resistance of the circuit,
according to Eq. 31-65.
Calculation: Solving Eq. 31-65 for f leads to
(Answer)
The negative phase constant is consistent with the fact that
the load is mainly capacitive; that is, XC - XL. In the com-
mon mnemonic for driven series RLC circuits, this circuit is
an ICE circuit—the current leads the driving emf.

Current amplitude, impedance, and phase constant
In Fig. 31-7, let R ! 200 ", C ! 15.0 mF, L ! 230 mH,
fd ! 60.0 Hz, and #m ! 36.0 V. (These parameters are those
used in the earlier sample problems.)
(a) What is the current amplitude I?
KEY IDEA
The current amplitude I depends on the amplitude #m of the
driving emf and on the impedance Z of the circuit, accord-
ing to Eq. 31-62 (I ! #m/Z).
Calculations: So, we need to find Z, which depends on resis-
tance R, capacitive reactance XC, and inductive reactance XL.
The circuit’s resistance is the given resistance R. Its capacitive
reactance is due to the given capacitance and, from an earlier
sample problem, XC ! 177 ". Its inductive reactance is due
to the given inductance and, from another sample problem,
XL ! 86.7 ".Thus,the circuit’s impedance is

To make physical sense of Fig. 31-16, consider how the reactances XL and
XC change as we increase the driving angular frequency vd, starting with a value
much less than the natural frequency v. For small vd, reactance XL (! vdL) is
small and reactance XC (! 1/vdC) is large. Thus, the circuit is mainly capacitive
and the impedance is dominated by the large XC, which keeps the current low.
As we increase vd, reactance XC remains dominant but decreases while reac-
tance XL increases. The decrease in XC decreases the impedance, allowing the
current to increase, as we see on the left side of any resonance curve in Fig. 31-16.
When the increasing XL and the decreasing XC reach equal values, the current is
greatest and the circuit is in resonance, with vd ! v.
As we continue to increase vd, the increasing reactance XL becomes pro-
gressively more dominant over the decreasing reactance XC. The impedance
increases because of XL and the current decreases, as on the right side of any
resonance curve in Fig. 31-16. In summary, then: The low-angular-frequency side
of a resonance curve is dominated by the capacitor’s reactance, the high-angular-
frequency side is dominated by the inductor’s reactance, and resonance occurs in
the middle.
Checkpoint 6
Here are the capacitive reactance and inductive reactance, respectively, for three
sinusoidally driven series RLC circuits: (1) 50 ", 100 "; (2) 100 ", 50 "; (3) 50 ", 50 ".
(a) For each, does the current lead or lag the applied emf, or are the two in phase?
(b) Which circuit is in resonance?
