Figure 9-23 shows an overhead
view of three particles on which ex-
ternal forces act.The magnitudes and
directions of the forces on two of the
particles are indicated. What are the
magnitude and direction of the force
acting on the third particle if the cen-
ter of mass of the three-particle sys-
tem is (a) stationary, (b) moving at a
constant velocity rightward,and (c) accelerating rightward?

Figure 9-24 shows an over-
head view of four particles of
equal mass sliding over a fric-
tionless surface at constant
velocity. The directions of the
velocities are indicated; their
magnitudes are equal. Consider
pairing the particles. Which
pairs form a system with a cen-
ter of mass that (a) is stationary,
(b) is stationary and at the ori-
gin,and (c) passes through the origin?

Consider a box that explodes into two pieces while moving with
a constant positive velocity along an x axis. If one piece, with mass
m1, ends up with positive velocity 
, then the second piece, with
mass m2, could end up with (a) a positive velocity 
(Fig. 9-25a), (b)
a negative velocity 
(Fig. 9-25b), or (c) zero velocity (Fig. 9-25c).
Rank those three possible results for the second piece according to
the corresponding magnitude of ,greatest first.

boxes move over a frictionless confectioner’s counter. For each box,
is its linear momentum conserved along the x axis and the y axis?

Figure 9-28 shows four groups of three or four identical particles
that move parallel to either the x axis or the y axis,at identical speeds.
Rank the groups according to center-of-mass speed,greatest first.

A block slides along a frictionless floor and into a stationary sec-
ond block with the same mass. Figure 9-29 shows four choices for a

represents (b) an elastic collision and (c) an inelastic collision?

Figure 9-30 shows a snapshot of
block 1 as it slides along an x axis on a
frictionless floor, before it undergoes
an elastic collision with stationary
block 2.The figure also shows three possible positions of the center of
mass (com) of the two-block system at the time of the snapshot.(Point
B is halfway between the centers of the two blocks.) Is block 1 station-
ary,moving forward,or moving backward after the collision if the com
is located in the snapshot at (a) A,(b) B,and (c) C?
