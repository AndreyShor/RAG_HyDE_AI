gether or blow apart? The nuclide 239Pu is spherical with radius 6.64
fm. For this nuclide, what are (b) the electric potential energy U ac-
cording to the equation, (c) the electric potential energy per proton,

ber of the nucleus in question. (b) Show that the energy associated
with the Coulomb force between protons in a nucleus is propor-

Because the neutron has no charge, its mass must be found
in some way other than by using a mass spectrometer.When a neu-
tron and a proton meet (assume both to be almost stationary), they
combine and form a deuteron, emitting a gamma ray whose energy
is 2.2233 MeV. The masses of the proton and the deuteron are
1.007 276 467 u and 2.013 553 212 u, respectively. Find the mass of
the neutron from these data.

A periodic table might list the average atomic mass of mag-
nesium as being 24.312 u, which is the result of weighting the
atomic masses of the magnesium isotopes according to their natu-
ral abundances on Earth. The three isotopes and their masses are
24Mg (23.985 04 u), 25Mg (24.985 84 u), and 26Mg (25.982 59 u).
The natural abundance of 24Mg is 78.99% by mass (that is, 78.99%
of the mass of a naturally occurring sample of magnesium is due
to the presence of 24Mg). What is the abundance of (a) 25Mg and
(b) 26Mg?

(a) Show that the total binding energy Ebe of a
given nuclide is
Ebe ! Z)H ' N)n # ),
where )H is the mass excess of 1H, )n is the mass excess of a neutron,
and ) is the mass excess of the given nuclide. (b) Using this method,
calculate the binding energy per nucleon for 197Au.Compare your re-
sult with the value listed in Table 42-1. The needed mass excesses,
rounded to three significant figures, are )H ! '7.29 MeV, )n !
'8.07 MeV,and )197 ! #31.2 MeV.Note the economy of calculation
that results when mass excesses are used in place of the actual
masses.

be required to separate all the neutrons and protons in this coin
from one another. For simplicity, assume that the penny is made en-
tirely of 63Cu atoms (of mass 62.929 60 u).The masses of the proton-
plus-electron and the neutron are 1.007 83 u and 1.008 66 u,

Radioactive Decay

Cancer cells are more vulnerable to x and gamma radiation
than are healthy cells. In the past, the standard source for radiation
therapy was radioactive 60Co, which decays, with a half-life of 5.27
y, into an excited nuclear state of 60Ni.That nickel isotope then im-
mediately emits two gamma-ray photons, each with an approxi-
mate energy of 1.2 MeV. How many radioactive 60Co nuclei are
present in a 6000 Ci source of the type used in hospitals?
(Energetic particles from linear accelerators are now used in radia-
tion therapy.)
