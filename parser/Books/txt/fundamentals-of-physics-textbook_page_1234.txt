can move. The three quantum numbers, along with their names and the values
that they may have, are shown in Table 39-2.
Each set of quantum numbers 
identifies the wave function of a
particular quantum state. The quantum number n, called the principal
quantum number, appears in Eq. 39-34 for the energy of the state. The orbital
quantum number
is a measure of the magnitude of the angular momentum
associated with the quantum state. The orbital magnetic quantum number
is related to the orientation in space of this angular momentum vector. The re-
strictions on the values of the quantum numbers for the hydrogen atom, as
listed in Table 39-2, are not arbitrary but come out of the solution to
Schrödinger’s equation. Note that for the ground state (n ! 1), the restrictions
require that

has zero angular momentum, which is not predicted by Eq. 39-23 in the Bohr
model.

The Wave Function of the Hydrogen Atom’s Ground State
The wave function for the ground state of the hydrogen atom, as obtained by solv-
ing the three-dimensional Schrödinger equation and normalizing the result,is
(ground state),
(39-39)
where a
is the Bohr radius. This radius is loosely taken
to be the effective radius of a hydrogen atom and turns out to be a convenient
unit of length for other situations involving atomic dimensions.
As with other wave functions, c(r) in Eq. 39-39 does not have physical mean-
ing but c2(r) does, being the probability density—the probability per unit 
volume—that the electron can be detected. Specifically, c2(r) dV is the probabil-
ity that the electron can be detected in any given (infinitesimal) volume element
dV located at radius r from the center of the atom:
(39-40)
Because c2(r) here depends only on r, it makes sense to choose, as a volume
element dV, the volume between two concentric spherical shells whose radii are r
and r ' dr.That is, we take the volume element dV to be
dV ! (4pr 2) dr,
