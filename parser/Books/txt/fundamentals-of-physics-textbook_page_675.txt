22-7 A DIPOLE IN AN ELECTRIC FIELD
energy in its equilibrium orientation—at its lowest point.To rotate the dipole or
the pendulum to any other orientation requires work by some external agent.
In any situation involving potential energy, we are free to define the zero-
potential-energy configuration in an arbitrary way because only differences in po-
tential energy have physical meaning.The expression for the potential energy of an
electric dipole in an external electric field is simplest if we choose the potential en-
ergy to be zero when the angle u in Fig. 22-21 is 90".We then can find the potential
energy U of the dipole at any other value of u with Eq.8-1 (/U ! %W) by calculat-
ing the work W done by the field on the dipole when the dipole is rotated to that
value of u from 90".With the aid of Eq. 10-53 (W ! *t du) and Eq. 22-35, we find
that the potential energy U at any angle u is
(22-36)
Evaluating the integral leads to
U ! %pE cos u.
(22-37)
We can generalize this equation to vector form as
(potential energy of a dipole).
(22-38)
Equations 22-37 and 22-38 show us that the potential energy of the dipole is least
(
) when 
(
and 
are in the same direction); the potential energy is
greatest (
) when 
180 (
and 
are in opposite directions).
When a dipole rotates from an initial orientation ui to another orientation uf,
the work W done on the dipole by the electric field is
W ! %/U ! %(Uf % Ui),
(22-39)
where Uf and Ui are calculated with Eq. 22-38. If the change in orientation is
caused by an applied torque (commonly said to be due to an external agent), then
the work Wa done on the dipole by the applied torque is the negative of the work
done on the dipole by the field; that is,
Wa ! %W ! (Uf % Ui).

Microwave Cooking
Food can be warmed and cooked in a microwave oven if the food contains water
because water molecules are electric dipoles.When you turn on the oven, the mi-
crowave source sets up a rapidly oscillating electric field 
within the oven and
thus also within the food. From Eq. 22-34, we see that any electric field 
pro-
duces a torque on an electric dipole moment 
to align 
with 
. Because the
oven’s 
oscillates, the water molecules continuously flip-flop in a frustrated at-
tempt to align with .
Energy is transferred from the electric field to the thermal energy of the water
(and thus of the food) where three water molecules happened to have bonded to-
gether to form a group. The flip-flop breaks some of the bonds. When the mole-
cules reform the bonds, energy is transferred to the random motion of the group
and then to the surrounding molecules. Soon, the thermal energy of the water is
enough to cook the food.
