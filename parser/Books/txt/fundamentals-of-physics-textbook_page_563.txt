18-6 HEAT TRANSFER MECHANISMS
The rate Pabs at which an object absorbs energy via thermal radiation from its
environment, which we take to be at uniform temperature Tenv (in kelvins), is
Pabs # s´AT 4
env.
(18-39)
The emissivity ´ in Eq.18-39 is the same as that in Eq.18-38.An idealized blackbody
radiator, with ´ # 1, will absorb all the radiated energy it intercepts (rather than
sending a portion back away from itself through reflection or scattering).
Because an object both emits and absorbs thermal radiation, its net rate Pnet
of energy exchange due to thermal radiation is
Pnet # Pabs $ Prad # s´A(T 4
env $ T 4).
(18-40)
Pnet is positive if net energy is being absorbed via radiation and negative if it is
being lost via radiation.
Thermal radiation is involved in the numerous medical cases of a dead rat-
tlesnake striking a hand reaching toward it.Pits between each eye and nostril of a rat-
tlesnake (Fig.18-21) serve as sensors of thermal radiation.When,say,a mouse moves
close to a rattlesnake’s head,the thermal radiation from the mouse triggers these sen-
sors,causing a reflex action in which the snake strikes the mouse with its fangs and in-
jects its venom.The thermal radiation from a reaching hand can cause the same re-
flex action even if the snake has been dead for as long as 30 min because the snake’s
nervous system continues to function. As one snake expert advised, if you must re-
move a recently killed rattlesnake,use a long stick rather than your hand.
Figure 18-21 A rattlesnake’s face has thermal 
radiation detectors, allowing the snake to
strike at an animal even in complete darkness.

KEY IDEAS
(1) Temperature T4 helps determine the rate Pd at which en-
ergy is conducted through the brick, as given by Eq. 18-32.
However, we lack enough data to solve Eq. 18-32 for T4.
(2) Because the conduction is steady, the conduction rate Pd
through the brick must equal the conduction rate Pa through
the pine.That gets us going.
Calculations: From Eq. 18-32 and Fig. 18-22, we can write
Setting Pa # Pd and solving for T4 yield
Letting Ld # 2.0La and kd # 5.0ka, and inserting the known
temperatures, we find
# $8.0-C.

Sample Problem 18.06
Thermal conduction through a layered wall
Figure 18-22 shows the cross section of a wall made of
white pine of thickness La and brick of thickness Ld
(# 2.0La), sandwiching two layers of unknown material
with identical thicknesses and thermal conductivities. The
thermal conductivity of the pine is ka and that of the brick
is kd (# 5.0ka). The face area A of the wall is unknown.
Thermal conduction through the wall has reached the
steady state; the only known interface temperatures 
are T1 # 25-C, T2 # 20-C, and T5 # $10-C. What is inter-
face temperature T4?
