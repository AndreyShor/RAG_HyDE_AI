Diffraction Gratings
One of the most useful tools in the study of light and of objects that emit and
absorb light is the diffraction grating. This device is somewhat like the double-slit
arrangement of Fig. 35-10 but has a much greater number N of slits, often called
rulings, perhaps as many as several thousand per millimeter.An idealized grating
consisting of only five slits is represented in Fig. 36-18. When monochromatic
light is sent through the slits, it forms narrow interference fringes that can be
analyzed to determine the wavelength of the light. (Diffraction gratings can also
be opaque surfaces with narrow parallel grooves arranged like the slits in
Fig. 36-18. Light then scatters back from the grooves to form interference fringes
rather than being transmitted through open slits.)
Pattern. With monochromatic light incident on a diffraction grating, if we
gradually increase the number of slits from two to a large number N, the intensity
plot changes from the typical double-slit plot of Fig. 36-15c to a much more compli-
cated one and then eventually to a simple graph like that shown in Fig. 36-19a.The
pattern you would see on a viewing screen using monochromatic red light from,

Learning Objectives
●A diffraction grating is a series of “slits” used to separate
an incident wave into its component wavelengths by separat-
ing and displaying their diffraction maxima. Diffraction by N
(multiple) slits results in maxima (lines) at angles u such that
