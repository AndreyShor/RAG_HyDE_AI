To illustrate this idea, let us consider another example. If we go
into a ﬁeld of small violets, we know what “that smell” is. It is some
kind of molecule, or arrangement of atoms, that has worked its way
into our noses. First of all, how did it work its way in? That is rather
easy. If the smell is some kind of molecule in the air, jiggling around
and being knocked every which way, it might have accidentally
worked its way into the nose. Certainly it has no particular desire
to get into our nose. It is merely one helpless part of a jostling
crowd of molecules, and in its aimless wanderings this particular
chunk of matter happens to ﬁnd itself in the nose.
Now chemists can take special molecules like the odor of violets,
and analyze them and tell us the exact arrangement of the atoms in
space. We know that the carbon dioxide molecule is straight and
symmetrical: O—C—O. (That can be determined easily, too, by
physical methods.) However, even for the vastly more complicated
arrangements of atoms that there are in chemistry, one can, by a
long, remarkable process of detective work, ﬁnd the arrangements
of the atoms. Figure 1-9 is a picture of the air in the neighborhood
of a violet; again we ﬁnd nitrogen and oxygen in the air, and water
vapor. (Why is there water vapor? Because the violet is wet. All
plants transpire.) However, we also see a “monster” composed of
carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and oxygen atoms, which have
picked a certain particular pattern in which to be arranged. It is a
much more complicated arrangement than that of carbon dioxide;
