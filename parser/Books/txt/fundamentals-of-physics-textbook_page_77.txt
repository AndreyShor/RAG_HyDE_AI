3-3 MULTIPLYING VECTORS
If the angle 
between two vectors is 0°, the component of one vector along the
other is maximum, and so also is the dot product of the vectors. If, instead,
is 90°,
the component of one vector along the other is zero, and so is the dot product.

The Scalar Product
The scalar product of the vectors 
and 
in Fig. 3-18a is written as 
and
defined to be
" ab cos f,
(3-20)
where a is the magnitude of , b is the magnitude of , and 
is the angle between
and 
(or, more properly, between the directions of 
and ).There are actually
two such angles:
and 360°
. Either can be used in Eq. 3-20, because their
cosines are the same.
Note that there are only scalars on the right side of Eq. 3-20 (including the
value of cos ).Thus 
on the left side represents a scalar quantity. Because of
the notation,
is also known as the dot product and is spoken as “a dot b.”
A dot product can be regarded as the product of two quantities: (1) the mag-
nitude of one of the vectors and (2) the scalar component of the second vector
along the direction of the first vector. For example, in Fig. 3-18b,
has a scalar
component a cos 
along the direction of ; note that a perpendicular dropped
from the head of 
onto 
determines that component. Similarly,
has a scalar
component b cos 
along the direction of .

Multiplying these gives
the dot product.
Or multiplying these
gives the dot product.
Equation 3-20 can be rewritten as follows to emphasize the components:
"
" (a cos f)(b) " (a)(b cos f).
(3-21)
The commutative law applies to a scalar product, so we can write
"
"
" .
When two vectors are in unit-vector notation, we write their dot product as
"
" (ax # ay # az )"(bx # by # bz ),
(3-22)
which we can expand according to the distributive law: Each vector component
of the first vector is to be dotted with each vector component of the second vec-
tor. By doing so, we can show that
"
" axbx # ayby # azbz.
