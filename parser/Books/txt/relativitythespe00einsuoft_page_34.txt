VI 
THE  THEOREM  OF  THE  ADDITION  OF  VELOCI 
TIES  EMPLOYED  IN  CLASSICAL  MECHANICS 
LET  
us  suppose  our  old  friend  the  railway  carriage 
to  be  travelling  along  the  rails  with  a  constant 
velocity  v,  and  that  a  man  traverses  the  length  of 
the  carriage  in  the  direction  of  travel  with  a  velocity  w. 
How  quickly  or,  in  other  words,  with  what  velocity  W 
does  the  man  advance  relative  to  the  embankment 
during  the  process  ?  The  only  possible  answer  seems  to 
result  from  the  following  consideration  :  If  the  man  were 
to  stand  still  for  a  second,  he  would  advance  relative  to 
the  embankment  through  a  distance  v  equal  numerically 
to  the  velocity  of  the  carriage.  As  a  consequence  of 
his  walking,  however,  he  traverses  an  additional  distance 
w  relative  to  the  carriage,  and  hence  also  relative  to  the 
embankment,  in  this  second,  the  distance  w  being 
numerically  equal  to  the  velocity  with  which  he  is 
walking.  Thus  in  total  he  covers  the  distance  W=v-\-w 
relative  to  the  embankment  in  the  second  considered. 
We  shall  see  later  that  this  result,  which  expresses 
the  theorem  of  the  addition  of  velocities  employed  in 
classical  mechanics,  cannot  be  maintained  ;  in  other 
words,  the  law  that  we  have  just  written  down  does  not 
hold  in  reality.  For  the  time  being,  however,  we  shall 
assume  its  correctness.
