Cheerios (mass mC " 1.0 kg) and a
box of Wheaties (mass mW
3.0
kg) are accelerated across a hori-
zontal surface by a horizontal force
applied to the Cheerios box. The
magnitude of the frictional force on the Cheerios box is 2.0 N,
and the magnitude of the frictional force on the Wheaties box is
4.0 N. If the magnitude of 
is 12 N, what is the magnitude of the
force on the Wheaties box from the Cheerios box?

An initially stationary box of sand is to be pulled across a
floor by means of a cable in which the tension should not exceed
1100 N. The coefficient of static friction between the box and the
floor is 0.35. (a) What should be the angle between the cable and
the horizontal in order to pull the greatest possible amount of sand,
and (b) what is the weight of the sand and box in that situation?

In Fig. 6-23, a sled is held on an inclined plane by a cord
pulling directly up the plane. The sled is to be on the verge of
moving up the plane. In Fig. 6-
28, the magnitude F required of
the cord’s force on the sled is
plotted versus a range of values
for the coefficient of static fric-
tion ms between sled and plane:
F1 " 2.0 N, F2 " 5.0 N, and m2 "
0.50.At what angle u is the plane

You testify as an expert witness in a case involving an acci-
dent in which car A slid into the rear of car B, which was stopped at
a red light along a road headed down a hill (Fig. 6-25). You find
that the slope of the hill is u " 12.03, that the cars were separated
by distance d " 24.0 m when the driver of car A put the car into a
slide (it lacked any automatic anti-brake-lock system), and that the
speed of car A at the onset of braking was v0 " 18.0 m/s.With what
speed did car A hit car B if the coefficient of kinetic friction was
(a) 0.60 (dry road surface) and (b) 0.10 (road surface covered with
wet leaves)?

hand on one side and the fingers on the opposite
side (Fig. 6-21). Sincosky’s mass was 79 kg. If the
coefficient of static friction between hand and
rafter was 0.70, what was the least magnitude of
the normal force on the rafter from each thumb
or opposite fingers? (After suspending himself,
Sincosky chinned himself on the rafter and then
moved hand-over-hand along the rafter. If you do
not think Sincosky’s grip was remarkable, try to
repeat his stunt.)

A worker pushes horizontally on a 35 kg
crate with a force of magnitude 110 N.The coeffi-
cient of static friction between the crate and the
floor is 0.37. (a) What is the value of fs,max under
the circumstances? (b) Does the crate move?
(c) What is the frictional force on the crate from
the floor? (d) Suppose, next, that a second worker
pulls directly upward on the crate to help out.
What is the least vertical pull that will allow the
first worker’s 110 N push to move the crate? (e)
If, instead, the second worker pulls horizontally to help out, what is
the least pull that will get the crate moving?

Figure 6-22 shows the cross
section of a road cut into the side of
a mountain. The solid line AA/ rep-
resents a weak bedding plane along
which sliding is possible. Block B
directly above the highway is sepa-
rated from uphill rock by a large
crack (called a joint), so that only
friction between the block and the
bedding plane prevents sliding. The
mass of the block is 1.8 ' 107 kg, the dip angle u of the bedding
plane is 243, and the coefficient of static friction between block
and plane is 0.63. (a) Show that the block will not slide under
these circumstances. (b) Next, water seeps into the joint and ex-
pands upon freezing, exerting on the block a force 
parallel to
AA/. What minimum value of force magnitude F will trigger a
slide down the plane?
