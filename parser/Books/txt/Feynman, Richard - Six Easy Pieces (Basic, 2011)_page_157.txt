points at which very few electrons arrive when both holes are open,
but which receive many electrons if we close one hole, so closing one
hole increased the number from the other. Notice, however, that at
the center of the pattern, P12 is more than twice as large as P1 + P2.
It is as though closing one hole decreased the number of electrons
which come through the other hole. It seems hard to explain both
effects by proposing that the electrons travel in complicated paths.
It is all quite mysterious. And the more you look at it the more
mysterious it seems. Many ideas have been concocted to try to ex-
plain the curve for P12 in terms of individual electrons going around
in complicated ways through the holes. None of them has suc-
ceeded. None of them can get the right curve for P12 in terms of P1
and P2.
Yet, surprisingly enough, the mathematics for relating P1 and P2 to
P12 is extremely simple. For P12 is just like the curve I12 of Fig. 6-2,
and that was simple. What is going on at the backstop can be de-
scribed by two complex numbers that we can call 
and 
(they
are functions of x, of course). The absolute square of 
gives the
effect with only hole 1 open. That is, P1 = 
. The effect with
only hole 2 open is given by 
in the same way. That is, P2 = 
 .
And the combined effect of the two holes is just P12 = 
.
The mathematics is the same as what we had for the water waves!
(It is hard to see how one could get such a simple result from a
complicated game of electrons going back and forth through the
plate on some strange trajectory.)
We conclude the following: The electrons arrive in lumps, like
particles, and the probability of arrival of these lumps is distributed
like the distribution of intensity of a wave. It is in this sense that
an electron behaves “sometimes like a particle and sometimes like
a wave.”
Incidentally, when we were dealing with classical waves we de-
ﬁned the intensity as the mean over time of the square of the wave
amplitude, and we used complex numbers as a mathematical trick
to simplify the analysis. But in quantum mechanics it turns out
that the amplitudes must be represented by complex numbers. The
