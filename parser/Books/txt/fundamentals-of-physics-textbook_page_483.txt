16-4 THE WAVE EQUATION
Acceleration. The acceleration ay in Eq. 16-34 is the second derivative of the
displacement y with respect to time:
(16-36)
Forces. Figure 16-11b shows that 
2 is tangent to the string at the right end
of the string element.Thus we can relate the components of the force to the string
slope S2 at the right end as
(16-37)
We can also relate the components to the magnitude F2 (# t) with
or
(16-38)
However, because we assume that the element is only slightly tilted, F2y + F2x and
therefore we can rewrite Eq. 16-38 as
t # F2x.
(16-39)
Substituting this into Eq. 16-37 and solving for F2y yield
F2y # tS2.
(16-40)
Similar analysis at the left end of the string element gives us
F1y # tS1.
(16-41)
Net Force. We can now substitute Eqs. 16-35, 16-36, 16-40, and 16-41 into
Eq. 16-34 to write
or
(16-42)
Because the string element is short, slopes S2 and S1 differ by only a differential
amount dS, where S is the slope at any point:
(16-43)
First replacing S2 $ S1 in Eq. 16-42 with dS and then using Eq. 16-43 to substitute
dy/dx for S, we find
and
.
(16-44)
In the last step, we switched to the notation of partial derivatives because on
the left we differentiate only with respect to x and on the right we differenti-
ate only with respect to t. Finally, substituting from Eq. 16-26 (v #
), we
find
(wave equation).

This is the general differential equation that governs the travel of waves of all
types.
