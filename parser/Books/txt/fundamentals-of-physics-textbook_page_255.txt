9-4 COLLISION AND IMPULSE
Impulse: The impulse is then
(Answer)
which means the impulse magnitude is
The angle of

(Answer)
which a calculator evaluates as 75.4#. Recall that the physi-
cally correct result of an inverse tangent might be the
displayed answer plus 180#.We can tell which is correct here
by drawing the components of 
(Fig. 9-11c).We find that u
is actually 75.4# & 180# ! 255.4#, which we can write as
u ! %105#.
(Answer)
(b) The collision lasts for 14 ms. What is the magnitude of
the average force on the driver during the collision?
KEY IDEA
From Eq. 9-35 (J ! Favg "t), the magnitude Favg of the aver-
age force is the ratio of the impulse magnitude J to the dura-
tion "t of the collision.
Calculations: We have
.
(Answer)
Using F ! ma with m ! 80 kg, you can show that the magni-
tude of the driver’s average acceleration during the collision
is about 3.22 $ 103 m/s2 ! 329g, which is fatal.
Surviving: Mechanical engineers attempt to reduce the
chances of a fatality by designing and building racetrack
walls with more “give,” so that a collision lasts longer. For
example, if the collision here lasted 10 times longer and the
other data remained the same, the magnitudes of the aver-
age force and average acceleration would be 10 times less
and probably survivable.

Sample Problem 9.04
Two-dimensional impulse, race car–wall collision
Figure 9-11a is an overhead view of
the path taken by a race car driver as his car collides with the
racetrack wall. Just before the collision, he is traveling at
speed vi ! 70 m/s along a straight line at 30# from the wall.
Just after the collision, he is traveling at speed vf ! 50 m/s
along a straight line at 10# from the wall. His mass m is 80 kg.
(a) What is the impulse 
on the driver due to the collision?
KEY IDEAS
We can treat the driver as a particle-like body and thus apply
the physics of this module. However, we cannot calculate 
directly from Eq.9-30 because we do not know anything about
the force 
on the driver during the collision.That is, we do
not have a function of 
or a plot for it and thus cannot
integrate to find .However,we can find 
from the change in
the driver’s linear momentum via Eq.9-32 
.

The impulse on the car
is equal to the change
in the momentum.
The collision
changes the 
momentum.

before the collision (at angle 30# from the positive x direction)
and his momentum 
after the collision (at angle 10#).From
Eqs.9-32 and 9-22 
,we can write
(9-41)
We could evaluate the right side of this equation directly on
a vector-capable calculator because we know m is 80 kg,
is 50 m/s at %10#, and 
is 70 m/s at 30#. Instead, here we
evaluate Eq. 9-41 in component form.
