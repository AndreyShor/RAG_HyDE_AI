The smiling face of Fig. 24-
49 consists of three items:
1. a thin rod of charge '3.0 mC that
forms a full circle of radius 6.0 cm;
2. a second thin rod of charge 2.0 mC
that forms a circular arc of radius
4.0 cm, subtending an angle of 90%
about the center of the full circle;
3. an electric dipole with a dipole

In Fig. 24-46, three thin plas-
tic rods form quarter-circles with a
common center of curvature at the
origin. The uniform charges on the
three rods are Q1 $ "30 nC, Q2 $
"3.0Q1, and Q3 $ '8.0Q1. What is
the net electric potential at the ori-
gin due to the rods?

Calculating the Field from the Potential

Two large parallel metal plates are 1.5 cm apart and have
charges of equal magnitudes but opposite signs on their facing sur-
faces. Take the potential of the negative plate to be zero. If the
potential halfway between the plates is then "5.0 V, what is the
electric field in the region between the plates?

The electric potential at points in an xy plane is given by 
V $ (2.0 V/m2)x2 ' (3.0 V/m2)y2. In unit-vector notation, what is
the electric field at the point (3.0 m, 2.0 m)?
•36
The electric potential V in the space between two flat parallel
plates 1 and 2 is given (in volts) by V $ 1500x2, where x (in meters)
is the perpendicular distance from plate 1. At x $ 1.3 cm, (a) what
is the magnitude of the electric field and (b) is the field directed to-
ward or away from plate 1?
••37
What is the magnitude of the electric field at the point

given by V
2.00xyz2, where V is in volts and coordinates x, y,
and z are in meters?

Figure 24-47 shows a thin plastic rod of length L $ 13.5 cm
and uniform charge 43.6 fC. (a) In terms of distance d, find an ex-
pression for the electric potential at point P1. (b) Next, substitute
variable x for d and find an expression for the magnitude of the
component Ex of the electric field at P1. (c) What is the direction of
Ex relative to the positive direction of the x axis? (d) What is the
value of Ex at P1 for x $ d $ 6.20 cm? (e) From the symmetry in
Fig. 24-47, determine Ey at P1.

An electron is placed in an xy plane where the electric po-
tential depends on x and y as shown, for the coordinate axes, in
Fig. 24-51 (the potential does not depend on z). The scale of the
vertical axis is set by Vs
500 V. In unit-vector notation, what is
the electric force on the electron?
