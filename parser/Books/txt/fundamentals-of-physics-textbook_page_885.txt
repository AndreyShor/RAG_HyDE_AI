radius R and two radial lengths; it carries current i1 ! 2.0 A in the
direction indicated.Wire 2 is long and straight; it carries a current i2
that can be varied; and it is at distance R/2 from the center of the
arc. The net magnetic field 
due to the two currents is measured
at the center of curvature of the arc. Figure 29-56b is a plot of
the component of

a function of current i2. The horizontal scale is set by i2s ! 1.00 A.
What is the angle subtended by the arc?

In Fig. 29-57, four long straight wires are perpendicular
to the page, and their cross sections form a square of edge length
a ! 20 cm. The currents are out of the page in wires 1 and 4 and
into the page in wires 2 and 3, and each wire carries 20 A. In
unit-vector notation, what is the net magnetic field at the
square’s center?

Figure 29-61 shows
a cross section of a long thin ribbon
of width w ! 4.91 cm that is carrying
a uniformly distributed total current 
i ! 4.61 mA into the page.In unit-vec-
tor notation, what is the magnetic
field 
at a point P in the plane of the
ribbon at a distance d ! 2.16 cm from
its edge? (Hint: Imagine the ribbon as
being constructed from many long,
thin,parallel wires.)

Figure 29-62 shows,
in
cross section, two long straight wires
held against a plastic cylinder of ra-
dius 20.0 cm. Wire 1 carries current 
i1 ! 60.0 mA out of the page and is
fixed in place at the left side of the
cylinder. Wire 2 carries current i2 !
40.0 mA out of the page and can be
moved around the cylinder. At what
(positive) angle u2 should wire 2 be
positioned such that, at the origin,
the net magnetic field due to the two
currents has magnitude 80.0 nT?

Two long straight thin wires with current lie against an
equally long plastic cylinder, at radius R ! 20.0 cm from the cylin-
der’s central axis. Figure 29-58a shows, in cross section, the cylinder
and wire 1 but not wire 2.With wire 2 fixed in place, wire 1 is moved
around the cylinder, from angle u1 ! 0° to angle u1 ! 180°, through
the first and second quadrants of the xy coordinate system.The net
magnetic field 
at the center of the cylinder is measured as a
function of u1. Figure 29-58b gives the x component Bx of that field
as a function of u1 (the vertical scale is set by Bxs ! 6.0 mT), and Fig.
29-58c gives the y component By (the vertical scale is set by Bys ! 4.0
mT). (a) At what angle u2 is wire 2 located? What are the (b) size and
(c) direction (into or out of the page) of the current in wire 1 and the
(d) size and (e) direction of the current in wire 2?

net magnetic field at the center of curvature versus angle u. The
vertical scale is set by Ba ! 10.0 mT and Bb ! 12.0 mT. What is
the radius of the smaller semicircle?
loop in Fig. 29-60a lies all in one plane
and consists of a semicircle of radius 10.0
