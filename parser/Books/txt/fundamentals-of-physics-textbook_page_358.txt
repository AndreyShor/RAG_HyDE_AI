Some Examples of Static Equilibrium
Here we examine several sample problems involving static equilibrium. In
each, we select a system of one or more objects to which we apply the equa-
tions of equilibrium (Eqs. 12-7, 12-8, and 12-9).The forces involved in the equi-
librium are all in the xy plane, which means that the torques involved are par-
allel to the z axis. Thus, in applying Eq. 12-9, the balance of torques, we select
an axis parallel to the z axis about which to calculate the torques. Although
Eq. 12-9 is satisfied for any such choice of axis, you will see that certain choices
simplify the application of Eq. 12-9 by eliminating one or more unknown force
terms.

origin (about which to calculate torques) can simplify the
calculations by eliminating one or more unknown forces
from the torque equation.
●A rigid body at rest is said to be in static equilibrium. For
such a body, the vector sum of the external forces acting on it
is zero:
(balance of forces).
If all the forces lie in the xy plane, this vector equation is
equivalent to two component equations:
Fnet,x ! 0
and
Fnet,y ! 0
(balance of forces).
F
:
net ! 0
●Static equilibrium also implies that the vector sum of the
external torques acting on the body about any point is zero, or
(balance of torques).
If the forces lie in the xy plane, all torque vectors are parallel
to the z axis, and the balance-of-torques equation is equiva-
lent to the single component equation
tnet,z ! 0
(balance of torques).

The right side of this equation gives the coordinate xcom of the body’s center of
mass (Eq. 9-4).We now have what we sought to prove. If the acceleration of grav-
ity is the same at all locations of the elements in a body, then the coordinates of
the body’s com and cog are identical:
xcog ! xcom.
