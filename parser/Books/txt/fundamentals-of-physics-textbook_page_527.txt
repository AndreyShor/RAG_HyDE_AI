17-7 THE DOPPLER EFFECT
Source Moving, Detector Stationary
Let detector D be stationary with respect to the body of air, and let source S
move toward D at speed vS (Fig. 17-22).The motion of S changes the wavelength
of the sound waves it emits and thus the frequency detected by D.
To see this change, let T (# 1/f) be the time between the emission of any
pair of successive wavefronts W1 and W2. During T, wavefront W1 moves a dis-
tance vT and the source moves a distance vST. At the end of T, wavefront W2 is
emitted. In the direction in which S moves, the distance between W1 and W2, which
is the wavelength l, of the waves moving in that direction, is vT $ vST. If D detects
those waves,it detects frequency f, given by
.
(17-53)
Note that f, must be greater than f unless vS # 0.
In the direction opposite that taken by S, the wavelength l, of the waves is
again the distance between successive waves but now that distance is vT " vST. If
D detects those waves, it detects frequency f, given by
.
(17-54)
Now f, must be less than f unless vS # 0.
We can summarize Eqs. 17-53 and 17-54 with
(source moving, detector stationary).

General Doppler Effect Equation
We can now derive the general Doppler effect equation by replacing f in
Eq. 17-55 (the source frequency) with f, of Eq. 17-52 (the frequency associated
with motion of the detector). That simple replacement gives us Eq. 17-47 for the
general Doppler effect.That general equation holds not only when both detector
and source are moving but also in the two specific situations we just discussed.
For the situation in which the detector is moving and the source is stationary, sub-
stitution of vS # 0 into Eq. 17-47 gives us Eq. 17-52, which we previously found.
For the situation in which the source is moving and the detector is stationary,
substitution of vD # 0 into Eq. 17-47 gives us Eq. 17-55, which we previously
found.Thus, Eq. 17-47 is the equation to remember.

Figure 17-22 A detector D is stationary,
and a source S is moving toward it at
speed vS. Wavefront W1 was emitted
when the source was at S1, wavefront
W7 when it was at S7. At the moment
depicted, the source is at S. The
detector senses a higher frequency
because the moving source, chasing
its own wavefronts, emits a reduced
wavelength l, in the direction of its
motion.
