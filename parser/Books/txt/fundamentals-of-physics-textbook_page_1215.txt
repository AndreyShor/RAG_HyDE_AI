39-1 ENERGIES OF A TRAPPED ELECTRON
kinetic energy. Hence, we can write the de Broglie wavelength of this electron as
(39-3)
If we substitute Eq. 39-3 into Eq. 39-1 and solve for the energy E, we find that E
depends on n according to
for n ! 1, 2, 3, . . . .
(39-4)
The positive integer n here is the quantum number of the electron’s quantum
state in the trap.
Equation 39-4 tells us something important: Because the electron is confined to
the trap, it can have only the energies given by the equation. It cannot have an en-
ergy that is, say, halfway between the values for n ! 1 and n ! 2. Why this restric-
tion? Because an electron is a matter wave.Were it, instead, a particle as assumed in
classical physics,it could have any value of energy while it is confined to the trap.
Figure 39-3 is a graph showing the lowest five allowed energy values for an
electron in an infinite well with L ! 100 pm (about the size of a typical atom).
The values are called energy levels, and they are drawn in Fig. 39-3 as levels, or
steps, on a ladder, in an energy-level diagram. Energy is plotted vertically; nothing
is plotted horizontally.
The quantum state with the lowest possible energy level E1 allowed by
Eq. 39-4, with quantum number n ! 1, is called the ground state of the electron.
The electron tends to be in this lowest energy state. All the quantum states with
greater energies (corresponding to quantum numbers n ! 2 or greater) are called
excited states of the electron.The state with energy level E2, for quantum number
n ! 2, is called the first excited state because it is the first of the excited states as
we move up the energy-level diagram.The other states have similar names.
Energy Changes
A trapped electron tends to have the lowest allowed energy and thus to be in its
ground state. It can be changed to an excited state (in which it has greater energy)
only if an external source provides the additional energy that is required for the
change. Let Elow be the initial energy of the electron and Ehigh be the greater
energy in a state that is higher on its energy-level diagram. Then the amount of
energy that is required for the electron’s change of state is
)E ! Ehigh # Elow.
(39-5)
An electron that receives such energy is said to make a quantum jump (or tran-
sition),or to be excited from the lower-energy state to the higher-energy state.Figure
39-4a represents a quantum jump from the ground state (with energy level E1) to
the third excited state (with energy level E4).As shown, the jump must be from one
energy level to another,but it can bypass one or more intermediate energy levels.
Photons. One way an electron can gain energy to make a quantum jump up
to a greater energy level is to absorb a photon. However, this absorption and
quantum jump can occur only if the following condition is met:

If a confined electron is to absorb a photon, the energy hf of the photon must
equal the energy difference )E between the initial energy level of the electron
and a higher level.
