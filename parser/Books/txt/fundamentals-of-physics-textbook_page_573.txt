(a) Calculate the rate at which body heat is conducted
through the clothing of a skier in a steady-state process, given the
following data: the body surface area is 1.8 m2, and the clothing is
1.0 cm thick; the skin surface temperature is 33 C and the outer
surface of the clothing is at 1.0 C; the thermal conductivity of the
clothing is 0.040 W/m9K. (b) If, after a fall, the skier’s clothes be-
came soaked with water of thermal conductivity 0.60 W/m9K, by
how much is the rate of conduction multiplied?

A 2.50 kg lump of aluminum is heated to 92.0 C and then
dropped into 8.00 kg of water at 5.00 C. Assuming that the
lump–water system is thermally isolated, what is the system’s equi-
librium temperature?
86
A glass window pane is exactly 20 cm by 30 cm at 10 C. By
how much has its area increased when its temperature is 40 C, as-
suming that it can expand freely?
87
A recruit can join the semi-secret “300 F” club at the
Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station only when the outside tem-
perature is below $70 C. On such a day, the recruit first basks in a
hot sauna and then runs outside wearing only shoes. (This is, of
course, extremely dangerous, but the rite is effectively a protest
against the constant danger of the cold.)
Assume that upon stepping out of the sauna, the recruit’s skin
temperature is 102 F and the walls, ceiling, and floor of the sauna
room have a temperature of 30 C. Estimate the recruit’s surface
area, and take the skin emissivity to be 0.80. (a) What is the ap-
proximate net rate Pnet at which the recruit loses energy via ther-
mal radiation exchanges with the room? Next, assume that when
outdoors, half the recruit’s surface area exchanges thermal radia-
tion with the sky at a temperature of $25 C and the other half
exchanges thermal radiation with the snow and ground at a tem-
perature of $80 C. What is the approximate net rate at which the
recruit loses energy via thermal radiation exchanges with (b) the
sky and (c) the snow and ground?

A steel rod at 25.0 C is bolted at both ends and then cooled.
At what temperature will it rupture? Use Table 12-1.

An athlete needs to lose weight and decides to do it by
“pumping iron.” (a) How many times must an 80.0 kg weight be
lifted a distance of 1.00 m in order to burn off 1.00 lb of fat, assum-
ing that that much fat is equivalent to 3500 Cal? (b) If the weight is
lifted once every 2.00 s, how long does the task take?

Soon after Earth was formed, heat released by the decay of ra-
dioactive elements raised the average internal temperature from 300
to 3000 K, at about which value it remains today.Assuming an aver-
age coefficient of volume expansion of 3.0 ' 10$5 K$1, by how much
has the radius of Earth increased since the planet was formed?
91
It is possible to melt ice by rubbing one block of it against
another. How much work, in joules, would you have to do to get
1.00 g of ice to melt?
92
A rectangular plate of glass initially has the dimensions 0.200 m
by 0.300 m. The coefficient of linear expansion for the glass is
9.00 ' 10$6/K.What is the change in the plate’s area if its tempera-
ture is increased by 20.0 K?
93
Suppose that you intercept 5.0 ' 10$3 of the energy radiated
by a hot sphere that has a radius of 0.020 m, an emissivity of 0.80,
and a surface temperature of 500 K. How much energy do you in-
tercept in 2.0 min?

0.300 kg of water, and it comes to the same final temperature as
the water. If the thermometer then reads 44.4 C, what was the tem-
perature of the water before insertion of the thermometer?

A sample of gas expands from
V1 # 1.0 m3 and p1 # 40 Pa to V2 #
4.0 m3 and p2 # 10 Pa along path B in
the p-V diagram in Fig. 18-58. It is
then compressed back to V1 along
either path A or path C. Compute the
net work done by the gas for the
complete cycle along (a) path BA and
(b) path BC.

Figure 18-59 shows a composite
bar of length L # L1 " L2 and con-
sisting of two materials. One mate-
rial has length L1 and coeffi-
cient of linear expansion a1;
the other has length L2 and
coefficient of linear expan-
sion a2. (a) What is the coeffi-
cient of linear expansion a for
the composite bar? For a particular composite bar, L is 52.4 cm,
material 1 is steel, and material 2 is brass. If a # 1.3 ' 10$5/C-,
what are the lengths (b) L1 and (c) L2?

On finding your stove out of order, you decide to boil the wa-
ter for a cup of tea by shaking it in a thermos flask. Suppose that
you use tap water at 19-C, the water falls 32 cm each shake, and
you make 27 shakes each minute. Neglecting any loss of thermal
energy by the flask, how long (in minutes) must you shake the flask
until the water reaches 100-C?

The p-V diagram in Fig. 18-60
shows two paths along which a sample
of gas can be taken from state a to state
b, where Vb
3.0V1. Path 1 requires
that energy equal to 5.0p1V1 be trans-
ferred to the gas as heat. Path 2 requires
that energy equal to 5.5p1V1 be trans-
ferred to the gas as heat. What is the ra-
tio p2/p1?

emissivity 0.75, and temperature $100-C
floats in an environment at $150-C.What
is the cube’s net thermal radiation transfer rate?

A flow calorimeter is a device used to measure the specific
heat of a liquid. Energy is added as heat at a known rate to a
stream of the liquid as it passes through the calorimeter at a
known rate. Measurement of the resulting temperature difference
between the inflow and the outflow points of the liquid stream en-
ables us to compute the specific heat of the liquid. Suppose a liquid
of density 0.85 g/cm3 flows through a calorimeter at the rate of 8.0
cm3/s. When energy is added at the rate of 250 W by means of an
electric heating coil, a temperature difference of 15 C- is estab-
lished in steady-state conditions between the inflow and the out-
flow points.What is the specific heat of the liquid?

An object of mass 6.00 kg falls through a height of 50.0 m
and, by means of a mechanical linkage, rotates a paddle wheel
that stirs 0.600 kg of water. Assume that the initial gravitational
potential energy of the object is fully transferred to thermal en-
ergy of the water, which is initially at 15.0 C.What is the temper-
ature rise of the water?
