as before, forming a body of liquid water, but now we also see the
surface of the water. Above the surface we ﬁnd a number of things:
First of all there are water molecules, as in steam. This is water
vapor, which is always found above liquid water. (There is an equi-
librium between the steam vapor and the water which will be de-
scribed later.) In addition we ﬁnd some other molecules—here two
oxygen atoms stuck together by themselves, forming an oxygen mol-
ecule, there two nitrogen atoms also stuck together to make a ni-
trogen molecule. Air consists almost entirely of nitrogen, oxygen,
some water vapor, and lesser amounts of carbon dioxide, argon,
and other things. So above the water surface is the air, a gas, con-
taining some water vapor. Now what is happening in this picture?
The molecules in the water are always jiggling around. From time
to time, one on the surface happens to be hit a little harder than
usual, and gets knocked away. It is hard to see that happening in
the picture because it is a still picture. But we can imagine that one
molecule near the surface has just been hit and is ﬂying out, or per-
haps another one has been hit and is ﬂying out. Thus, molecule by
molecule, the water disappears—it evaporates. But if we close the
vessel above, after a while we shall ﬁnd a large number of molecules
of water amongst the air molecules. From time to time, one of these
vapor molecules comes ﬂying down to the water and gets stuck
again. So we see that what looks like a dead, uninteresting thing—
a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps
