already done this on an astronomical scale because all stars and galaxies appear
to consist largely of matter and not antimatter. This is a perplexing observation
because it means that when the universe began, some feature biased the con-
ditions toward matter and away from antimatter. (For example, electrons are
common but positrons are not.) This bias is still not well understood.
An Interlude
Before pressing on with the task of classifying the particles, let us step aside for a
moment and capture some of the spirit of particle research by analyzing a typical
particle event—namely,that shown in the bubble-chamber photograph of Fig.44-2a.
The tracks in this figure consist of bubbles formed along the paths of 
electrically charged particles as they move through a chamber filled with liquid
hydrogen. We can identify the particle that makes a particular track by—
among other means—measuring the relative spacing between the bubbles. The
chamber lies in a uniform magnetic field that deflects the tracks of positively

chamber from the left. (b) The tracks redrawn and labeled for clarity. (c) The tracks are curved because a magnetic
field present in the chamber exerts a deflecting force on each moving charged particle.
