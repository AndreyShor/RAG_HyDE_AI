A particle oscillates left
and right in simple
harmonic motion.
Rotating the figure reveals
that the motion forms a
cosine function.
This is a graph of the motion,
with the period T indicated.
The speed is zero at
extreme points.
The speed is greatest
at x = 0.
The speed 
is zero at the 
extreme points.
The speed is greatest
at the midpoint.
Figure 15-2 (a) A sequence of “freeze-frames”(taken at equal time intervals) showing the position of a par-
ticle as it oscillates back and forth about the origin of an x axis,between the limits #xm and %xm.(b) The
vector arrows are scaled to indicate the speed of the particle.The speed is maximum when the particle is at
the origin and zero when it is at 7xm.If the time t is chosen to be zero when the particle is at #xm,then the
particle returns to #xm at t ! T,where T is the period of the motion.The motion is then repeated.(c)
Rotating the figure reveals the motion forms a cosine function of time,as shown in (d).(e) The speed (the
slope) changes.
