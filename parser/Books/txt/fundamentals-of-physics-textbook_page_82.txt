Figure 3-25 shows vector 
and
four other vectors that have the same
magnitude but differ in orientation.
(a) Which of those other four vectors
have the same dot product with ? (b)
Which have a negative dot product
with
?

In a game held within a three-
dimensional maze, you must move
your game piece from start, at xyz co-
ordinates (0, 0, 0), to finish, at coordinates ($2 cm, 4 cm, $4 cm).
The game piece can undergo only the displacements (in centime-
ters) given below. If, along the way, the game piece lands at coordi-
nates ($5 cm, $1 cm, $1 cm) or (5 cm, 2 cm, $1 cm), you lose the
game. Which displacements and in what sequence will get your
game piece to finish?
" $7 # 2 $ 3
" 2 $ 3 # 2
" 2 $ # 4
" 3 # 5 $ 3 .

The x and y components of four vectors ,
, ,and 
are given
below. For which vectors will your calculator give you the correct an-
gle u when you use it to find u with Eq. 3-6? Answer first by examin-
ing Fig.3-12,and then check your answers with your calculator.
ax " 3
ay " 3
cx " $3
cy " $3
bx " $3
by " 3
dx " 3
dy " $3.

Questions
1
Can the sum of the magnitudes
of two vectors ever be equal to the
magnitude of the sum of the same
two vectors? If no, why not? If yes,
when?
2
The two vectors shown in Fig. 3-21
lie in an xy plane. What are the signs
of the x and y components, respec-
tively, of (a)
, (b) 
, and
(c) 
?

Being part of the “Gators,” the
University of Florida golfing team
must play on a putting green with an
alligator pit. Figure 3-22 shows an
overhead view of one putting chal-
lenge of the team; an xy coordinate
system is superimposed. Team mem-
bers must putt from the origin to the
hole, which is at xy coordinates (8 m,
12 m), but they can putt the golf ball
using only one or more of the fol-
lowing displacements, one or more
times:
,
.
The pit is at coordinates (8 m, 6 m). If a team member putts the
ball into or through the pit, the member is automatically trans-
ferred to Florida State University, the arch rival. What sequence
of displacements should a team member use to avoid the pit and
the school transfer?

Equation 3-2 shows that the addition of two vectors 
and 
is
commutative. Does that mean subtraction is commutative, so that

Which of the arrangements of axes in Fig. 3-23 can be labeled
“right-handed coordinate system”? As usual, each axis label indi-
cates the positive side of the axis.
