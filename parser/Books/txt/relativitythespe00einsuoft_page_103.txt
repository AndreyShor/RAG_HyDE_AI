EUCLIDEAN  AND  NON-EUCLIDEAN      85 
be  cases  in  which  the  experiment  would  be  unsuccessful. 
We  shall  suppose  that  the  rods  "  expand  "  by  an  amount 
proportional  to  the  increase  of  temperature.  We  heat 
the  central  part  of  the  marble  slab,  but  not  the  peri 
phery,  in  which  case  two  of  our  little  rods  can  still  be 
brought  into  coincidence  at  every  position  on  the  table. 
But  our  construction  of  squares  must  necessarily  come 
into  disorder  during  the  heating,  because  the  little  rods 
on  the  central  region  of  the  table  expand,  whereas 
those  on  the  outer  part  do  not. 
With  reference  to  our  little  rods — denned  as  unit 
lengths — the  marble  slab  is  no  longer  a  Euclidean  con 
tinuum,  and  we  are  also  no  longer  in  the  position  of  de 
nning  Cartesian  co-ordinates  directly  with  their  aid, 
since  the  above  construction  can  no  longer  be  carried 
out.  But  since  there  are  other  things  which  are  not 
influenced  in  a  similar  manner  to  the  little  rods  (or 
perhaps  not  at  all)  by  the  temperature  of  the  table,  it  is 
possible  quite  naturally  to  maintain  the  point  of  view 
that  the  marble  slab  is  a  "  Euclidean  continuum." 
This  can  be  done  in  a  satisfactory  manner  by  making  a 
more  subtle  stipulation  about  the  measurement  or  the 
comparison  of  lengths. 
But  if  rods  of  every  kind  (i.e.  of  every  material)  were 
to  behave  in  the  same  way  as  regards  the  influence  of 
temperature  when  they  are  on  the  variably  heated 
marble  slab,  and  if  we  had  no  other  means  of  detecting 
the  effect  of  temperature  than  the  geometrical  be 
haviour  of  our  rods  in  experiments  analogous  to  the  one 
described  above,  then  our  best  plan  would  be  to  assign 
the  distance  one  to  two  points  on  the  slab,  provided  that 
the  ends  of  one  of  our  rods  could  be  made  to  coincide 
with  these  two  points  ;  for  how  else  should  we  define
