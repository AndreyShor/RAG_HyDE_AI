In Fig. 28-40, an electron with an
initial kinetic energy of 4.0 keV enters re-
gion 1 at time t ! 0.That region contains a
uniform magnetic field directed into the
page, with magnitude 0.010 T.The electron
goes through a half-circle and then exits
region 1, headed toward region 2 across a
gap of 25.0 cm. There is an electric poten-
tial difference 'V ! 2000 V across the
gap, with a polarity such that the electron’s
speed increases uniformly as it traverses
the gap. Region 2 contains a uniform magnetic field directed out of
the page, with magnitude 0.020 T.The electron goes through a half-
circle and then leaves region 2. At what time t does it leave?

paths lying in a plane perpendicular to . How long after the decay
