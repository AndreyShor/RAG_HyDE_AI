off, what is the magnitude of the force exerted by the ship on its pi-
lot, who weighs 735 N on Earth?

tion and as (b) a magnitude and

object of mass m1 an acceleration

horizontal (case 1) or with

frigerator’s speed in case 2 to its speed in case 1 if you pull for a cer-

A 52 kg circus performer is to slide down a rope that will
break if the tension exceeds 425 N. (a) What happens if the per-
former hangs stationary on the rope? (b) At what magnitude of ac-
celeration does the performer just avoid breaking the rope?

An object is hung from a spring balance attached to the ceil-
ing of an elevator cab. The balance reads 65 N when the cab is
standing still. What is the reading when the cab is moving upward
(a) with a constant speed of 7.6 m/s and (b) with a speed of 7.6 m/s
while decelerating at a rate of 2.4 m/s2?

Imagine a landing craft approaching the surface of Callisto,
one of Jupiter’s moons. If the engine provides an upward force
(thrust) of 3260 N, the craft descends at constant speed; if the en-
gine provides only 2200 N, the craft accelerates downward at
0.39 m/s2. (a) What is the weight of the landing craft in the vicinity
of Callisto’s surface? (b) What is the mass of the craft? (c) What is
the magnitude of the free-fall acceleration near the surface of
Callisto?

A 1400 kg jet engine is fastened to the fuselage of a passenger
jet by just three bolts (this is the usual practice).Assume that each
bolt supports one-third of the load. (a) Calculate the force on each
bolt as the plane waits in line for clearance to take off. (b) During
flight, the plane encounters turbulence, which suddenly imparts an
upward vertical acceleration of 2.6 m/s2 to the plane. Calculate the
force on each bolt now.

An interstellar ship has a mass of 1.20 ' 106 kg and is initially at
rest relative to a star system.(a) What constant acceleration is needed
to bring the ship up to a speed of 0.10c (where c is the speed of light,
3.0 ' 108 m/s) relative to the star system in 3.0 days? (b) What is that

tion? (d) If the engines are shut down when 0.10c is reached (the
speed then remains constant), how long does the ship take (start to
finish) to journey 5.0 light-months, the distance that light travels in
5.0 months?

For sport, a 12 kg armadillo runs onto a large pond of level,
frictionless ice. The armadillo’s initial velocity is 5.0 m/s along the
positive direction of an x axis. Take its initial position on the ice as
being the origin. It slips over the ice while being pushed by a wind
with a force of 17 N in the positive direction of the y axis. In unit-
vector notation, what are the animal’s (a) velocity and (b) position
vector when it has slid for 3.0 s?

Suppose that in Fig. 5-12, the masses of the blocks are 2.0 kg
and 4.0 kg. (a) Which mass should the hanging block have if the
magnitude of the acceleration is to be as large as possible? What

in the cord?

A nucleus that captures a stray neutron must bring the neu-
tron to a stop within the diameter of the nucleus by means of the
strong force. That force, which “glues” the nucleus together, is ap-
proximately zero outside the nucleus. Suppose that a stray neutron
with an initial speed of 1.4 ' 107 m/s is just barely captured by a
nucleus with diameter d " 1.0 ' 10$14 m. Assuming the strong
force on the neutron is constant, find the magnitude of that force.
The neutron’s mass is 1.67 ' 10$27 kg.
