Magnetic Field 
A magnetic field
is defined in terms of the
force 
acting on a test particle with charge q moving through the
field with velocity :
(28-2)
The SI unit for 
is the tesla (T):1 T ! 1 N/(A)m) ! 104 gauss.
The Hall Effect
When a conducting strip carrying a current i is
placed in a uniform magnetic field 
, some charge carriers (with
charge e) build up on one side of the conductor, creating a poten-
tial difference V across the strip.The polarities of the sides indicate
the sign of the charge carriers.

Review & Summary
Magnetic Force on a Current-Carrying Wire
A straight
wire carrying a current i in a uniform magnetic field experiences a
sideways force
(28-26)
The force acting on a current element i
in a magnetic field is
(28-28)
The direction of the length vector 
or 
is that of the current i.
Torque on a Current-Carrying Coil
A coil (of area A and N
turns, carrying current i) in a uniform magnetic field 
will
experience a torque 
given by
(28-37)
Here 
is the magnetic dipole moment of the coil, with magnitude
NiA and direction given by the right-hand rule.
Orientation Energy of a Magnetic Dipole
The orienta-
tion energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is
(28-38)
If an external agent rotates a magnetic dipole from an initial orien-
tation ui to some other orientation uf and the dipole is stationary
both initially and finally, the work Wa done on the dipole by the
agent is
Wa ! 'U ! Uf % Ui.

(a) Rank the six choices according to the
potential difference set up across the
solid, greatest first. (b) For which choice
is the front face at lower potential?

Figure 28-25 shows the path of a
particle through six regions of uniform
magnetic field, where the path is either
a half-circle or a quarter-circle. Upon leaving the last region, the
particle travels between two charged, parallel plates and is
deflected toward the plate of higher potential. What is the
direction of the magnetic field in each of the six regions?

and experiences a magnetic force 
In each situation, determine
whether the orientations of the vectors are physically reasonable.

Figure 28-23 shows a wire that car-
ries current to the right through a uni-
form magnetic field.It also shows four
choices for the direction of that field.
(a) Rank the choices according to the
magnitude of the electric potential
difference that would be set up across
the width of the wire, greatest first. (b) For which choice is the top
side of the wire at higher potential than the bottom side of the wire?

Figure 28-24 shows a metallic, rectangular solid that is to move
at a certain speed v through the uniform magnetic field 
. The
dimensions of the solid are multiples of d, as shown. You have six
