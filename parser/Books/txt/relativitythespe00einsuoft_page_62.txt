GENERAL  RESULTS  OF  THE  THEORY 
IT  
is  clear  from  our  previous  considerations  that  the 
(special)  theory  of  relativity  has  grown  out  of  electro 
dynamics  and  optics.  In  these  fields  it  has  not 
appreciably  altered  the  predictions  of  theory,  but  it 
has  considerably  simplified  the  theoretical  structure, 
i.e.  the  derivation  of  laws,  and — what  is  incomparably 
more  important — it  has  considerably  reduced  the 
number  of  independent  hypotheses  forming  the  basis  of 
theory.  The  special  theory  of  relativity  has  rendered 
the  Maxwell-Lorentz  theory  so  plausible,  that  the  latter 
would  have  been  generally  accepted  by  physicists 
even  if  experiment  had  decided  less  unequivocally  in  its 
favour. 
Classical  mechanics  required  to  be  modified  before  it 
could  come  into  line  with  the  demands  of  the  special 
theory  of  relativity.  For  the  main  part,  however, 
this  modification  affects  only  the  laws  for  rapid  motions, 
in  which  the  velocities  of  matter  v  are  not  very  small  as 
compared  with  the  velocity  of  light.  We  have  experi 
ence  of  such  rapid  motions  only  in  the  case  of  electrons 
and  ions  ;  for  other  motions  the  variations  from  the  laws 
of  classical  mechanics  are  too  small  to  make  themselves 
evident  in  practice.  We  shall  not  consider  the  motion 
of  stars  until  we  come  to  speak  of  the  general  theory  of 
relativity.  In  accordance  with  the  theory  of  relativity
