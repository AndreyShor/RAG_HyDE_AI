Figure 25-35 shows a
variable “air gap” capacitor for
manual tuning. Alternate plates
are
connected together; one
group of plates is fixed in posi-
tion, and the other group is
capable of rotation. Consider a
capacitor of n ! 8 plates of al-
ternating polarity, each plate
having area A ! 1.25 cm2 and
separated from adjacent plates by distance d ! 3.40 mm.What is the
maximum capacitance of the device?
••21
In Fig. 25-36, the
capacitances are C1
1.0 mF and
C2
3.0 mF, and both capacitors are
charged to a potential difference of
V ! 100 V but with opposite polar-
ity as shown. Switches S1 and S2 are
now closed. (a) What is now the po-
tential difference between points a and b? What now is the charge
on capacitor (b) 1 and (c) 2?
••22
In Fig. 25-37, V ! 10 V, C1 ! 10
mF, and C2 ! C3 ! 20 mF. Switch S is
first thrown to the left side until capac-
itor 1 reaches equilibrium. Then the
switch is thrown to the right. When
equilibrium is again reached, how
much charge is on capacitor 1?

tors of capacitances C1

V, C2
3.0 mF, C4
4.0 mF, and all the capacitors are initially un-
charged. When switch S is closed, a total charge of 12 mC passes
through point a and a total charge of 8.0 mC passes through point

Capacitor 3 has a capacitance of 0.80 mF. What are the capaci-
tances of (a) capacitor 1 and (b) capacitor 2?

The capacitors in Fig. 25-38 are ini-
tially uncharged. The capacitances are 
C1 ! 4.0 mF, C2 ! 8.0 mF, and C3 ! 12 mF,
and the battery’s potential difference is 
V ! 12 V. When switch S is closed, how
many electrons travel through (a) point a,
(b) point b, (c) point c, and (d) point d? In
the figure, do the electrons travel up or down through (e) point b and
(f) point c?

Figure 25-39 represents two air-filled cylindrical capacitors
connected in series across a battery with potential V
10 V.
Capacitor 1 has an inner plate radius of 5.0 mm, an outer plate radius
of 1.5 cm,and a length of 5.0 cm.Capacitor 2 has an inner plate radius
of 2.5 mm, an outer plate radius of 1.0 cm, and a length of 9.0 cm.The
outer plate of capacitor 2 is a conducting
organic membrane that can be stretched,
and the capacitor can be inflated to in-
crease the plate separation. If the outer
plate radius is increased to 2.5 cm by in-
flation, (a) how many electrons move
through point P and (b) do they move to-
ward or away from the battery?

In Fig. 25-40, two parallel-plate
capacitors (with air between the plates)
are connected to a battery. Capacitor 1
has a plate area of 1.5 cm2 and an electric
field (between its plates) of magnitude
2000 V/m. Capacitor 2 has a plate area of
0.70 cm2 and an electric field of magnitude 1500 V/m. What is the
total charge on the two capacitors?

Capacitor 3 in Fig. 25-41a is a variable capacitor (its
capacitance C3 can be varied). Figure 25-41b gives the electric po-
tential V1 across capacitor 1 versus C3.The horizontal scale is set by
C3s = 12.0 mF. Electric potential V1 approaches an asymptote of
10 V as C3 : ,. What are (a) the electric potential V across the
battery, (b) C1, and (c) C2?
