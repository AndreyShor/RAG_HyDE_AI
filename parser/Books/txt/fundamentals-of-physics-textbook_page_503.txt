Two 
sinusoidal 
120 Hz
waves, of the same frequency
and amplitude, are to be sent in
the positive direction of an x axis
that is directed along a cord un-
der tension. The waves can be
sent in phase, or they can be
phase-shifted.

Body armor. When a high-speed projectile such as a
bullet or bomb fragment strikes modern body armor, the fabric of
the armor stops the projectile and prevents penetration by quickly
spreading the projectile’s energy over a large area. This spreading
is done by longitudinal and transverse pulses that move radially
from the impact point, where the projectile pushes a cone-shaped
dent into the fabric. The longitudinal pulse, racing along the fibers
of the fabric at speed vl ahead of the denting, causes the fibers to
thin and stretch, with material flowing radially inward into the
dent. One such radial fiber is shown in Fig. 16-48a. Part of the pro-
jectile’s energy goes into this motion and stretching.The transverse
