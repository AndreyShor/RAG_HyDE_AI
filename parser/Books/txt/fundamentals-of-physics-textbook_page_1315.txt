600 mg of potassium) and M is the molar mass of potassium.
Combining those two equations to eliminate n, we can write 
(42-21)
From Appendix F, we see that the molar mass of potassium
is 39.102 g/mol. Equation 42-21 then yields 
Substituting this value for N40 and the given half-life of
1.25 " 109 y for T1/2 into Eq. 42-20 leads to
(Answer)
This is about 0.51 nCi. Your body always has about 160 g of
potassium. If you repeat our calculation here, you will find
that the 40K component of that everyday amount has an ac-
tivity of 5.06 " 103 Bq (or 0.14 mCi). So, eating a banana
adds less than 1% to the radiation your body receives daily
from radioactive potassium.

Sample Problem 42.05
Radioactivity of the potassium in a banana
Of the 600 mg of potassium in a large banana, 0.0117% is
radioactive 40K, which has a half-life T1/2 of 1.25 " 109 y.
What is the activity of the banana?
KEY IDEAS
(1) We can relate the activity R to the disintegration con-
stant l with Eq. 42-17, but let’s write it as R ! lN40, where
N40 is the number of 40K nuclei (and thus atoms) in the ba-
nana. (2) We can relate the disintegration constant to the
known half-life T1/2 with Eq. 42-18 (T1/2! (ln 2)/l).
Calculations: Combining Eqs. 42-18 and 42-17 yields
(42-20)
We know that N40 is 0.0117% of the total number N of potas-
sium atoms in the banana. We can find an expression for N
by combining two equations that give the number of moles n
of potassium in the banana. From Eq. 19-2, n ! N/NA, where
NA is Avogadro’s number (6.02 " 1023 mol#1).From Eq.19-3,
n ! Msam/M, where Msam is the sample mass (here the given

42.23 For a given alpha decay, calculate the mass change

42.24 Determine the change in atomic number Z and mass
number A of a nucleus undergoing alpha decay.
42.25 In terms of the potential barrier, explain how an alpha
particle can escape from a nucleus with less energy than
the barrier height.
●Some nuclides decay by emitting an alpha particle (a helium nucleus, 4He). Such decay is inhibited by a potential energy
barrier that must be penetrated by tunneling.

Key Idea
Alpha Decay
When a nucleus undergoes alpha decay, it transforms to a different nuclide by
emitting an alpha particle (a helium nucleus, 4He). For example, when uranium
238U undergoes alpha decay, it transforms to thorium 234Th:
(42-22)
This alpha decay of 238U can occur spontaneously (without an external
source of energy) because the total mass of the decay products 234Th and 4He is
less than the mass of the original 238U. Thus, the total mass energy of the decay
238U : 234Th ' 4He.
