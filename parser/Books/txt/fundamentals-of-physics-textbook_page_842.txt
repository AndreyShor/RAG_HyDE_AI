Checkpoint 3
The figure here shows the circular paths of two particles that travel
at the same speed in a uniform magnetic field , which is directed
into the page. One particle is a proton; the other is an electron
(which is less massive). (a) Which particle follows the smaller circle,
and (b) does that particle travel clockwise or counterclockwise?

Calculating the electron’s speed v from its kinetic energy, we
find that v ! 2.81 $ 106 m/s, and so Eq. 28-21 gives us

Sample Problem 28.03
Helical motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field
An electron with a kinetic energy of 22.5 eV moves into a
region of uniform magnetic field 
of magnitude 4.55 $
10%4 T. The angle between the directions of 
and the elec-
tron’s velocity 
is 65.5°. What is the pitch of the helical
path taken by the electron?
KEY IDEAS
(1) The pitch p is the distance the electron travels parallel to
the magnetic field 
during one period T of circulation.
(2) The period T is given by Eq. 28-17 for any nonzero angle
between and .

Helical Paths
If the velocity of a charged particle has a component parallel to the (uniform) mag-
netic field, the particle will move in a helical path about the direction of the field
vector. Figure 28-11a, for example, shows the velocity vector 
of such a particle

MAGNETIC FIELDS

a uniform magnetic field , the particle’s

making an angle f with the field
direction. (b) The particle follows a helical
path of radius r and pitch p. (c) A charged
particle spiraling in a nonuniform magnetic
field. (The particle can become trapped in
this magnetic bottle, spiraling back and
forth between the strong field regions at
either end.) Note that the magnetic force
vectors at the left and right sides have a
component pointing toward the center of

resolved into two components,one parallel to 
and one perpendicular to it:
(28-20)
The parallel component determines the pitch p of the helix—that is, the distance
between adjacent turns (Fig. 28-11b). The perpendicular component determines
the radius of the helix and is the quantity to be substituted for v in Eq. 28-16.
Figure 28-11c shows a charged particle spiraling in a nonuniform magnetic
field. The more closely spaced field lines at the left and right sides indicate that
the magnetic field is stronger there.When the field at an end is strong enough, the
particle “reflects” from that end.
