convenience, Fig. 26-5 shows the equivalent drift of positive charge carriers in the
direction of the applied electric field 
Let us assume that these charge carriers
all move with the same drift speed vd and that the current density J is uniform
across the wireâ€™s cross-sectional area A. The number of charge carriers in a length
L of the wire is nAL, where n is the number of carriers per unit volume.The total
charge of the carriers in the length L, each with charge e, is then
q ! (nAL)e.
Because the carriers all move along the wire with speed vd, this total charge
moves through any cross section of the wire in the time interval
Equation 26-1 tells us that the current i is the time rate of transfer of charge
across a cross section, so here we have
(26-6)
Solving for vd and recalling Eq. 26-5 (J ! i/A), we obtain
or, extended to vector form,
(26-7)
Here the product ne, whose SI unit is the coulomb per cubic meter (C/m3), is the
carrier charge density. For positive carriers, ne is positive and Eq. 26-7 predicts
that 
and 
have the same direction. For negative carriers, ne is negative and 
and 
have opposite directions.

Sample Problem 26.02
Current density, uniform and nonuniform
(a) The current density in a cylindrical wire of radius R
2.0 mm is uniform across a cross section of the wire and is J !
2.0 $ 105 A/m2.What is the current through the outer portion
of the wire between radial distances R/2 and R (Fig.26-6a)?
KEY IDEA
Because the current density is uniform across the cross
section, the current density J, the current i, and the cross-
sectional area A are related by Eq. 26-5 (J ! i/A).
Calculations: We want only the current through a reduced
cross-sectional area A- of the wire (rather than the entire
!
area), where
