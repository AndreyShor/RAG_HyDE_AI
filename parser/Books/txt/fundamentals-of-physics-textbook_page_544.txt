The Celsius and Fahrenheit Scales
So far, we have discussed only the Kelvin scale, used in basic scientific work. In
nearly all countries of the world, the Celsius scale (formerly called the centigrade
scale) is the scale of choice for popular and commercial use and much scientific
use. Celsius temperatures are measured in degrees, and the Celsius degree has
the same size as the kelvin. However, the zero of the Celsius scale is shifted to a
more convenient value than absolute zero. If TC represents a Celsius temperature
and T a Kelvin temperature, then
TC # T $ 273.15-.
(18-7)
In expressing temperatures on the Celsius scale, the degree symbol is commonly
used. Thus, we write 20.00-C for a Celsius reading but 293.15 K for a Kelvin
reading.
The Fahrenheit scale, used in the United States, employs a smaller degree than
the Celsius scale and a different zero of temperature. You can easily verify both
these differences by examining an ordinary room thermometer on which both scales
are marked.The relation between the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales is
(18-8)
where TF is Fahrenheit temperature. Converting between these two scales can be
done easily by remembering a few corresponding points, such as the freezing and
boiling points of water (Table 18-1). Figure 18-7 compares the Kelvin, Celsius,
and Fahrenheit scales.
