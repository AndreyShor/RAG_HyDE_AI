self together as far as it can! If we go even further, the earth is not
exactly a sphere because it is rotating, and this brings in centrifugal
effects which tend to oppose gravity near the equator. It turns out
that the earth should be elliptical, and we even get the right shape
for the ellipse. We can thus deduce that the sun, the moon, and the
earth should be (nearly) spheres, just from the law of gravitation.
What else can you do with the law of gravitation? If we look at
the moons of Jupiter we can understand everything about the way
they move around that planet. Incidentally, there was once a certain
difficulty with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on.
These satellites were studied very carefully by Roemer, who noticed
that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and
sometimes behind. (One can ﬁnd their schedules by waiting a very
long time and ﬁnding out how long it takes on the average for the
moons to go around.) Now they were ahead when Jupiter was par-
ticularly close to the earth and they were behind when Jupiter was
farther from the earth. This would have been a very difficult thing
to explain according to the law of gravitation—it would have been,
in fact, the death of this wonderful theory if there were no other ex-
planation. If a law does not work even in one place where it ought
to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very
simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter
because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth.
