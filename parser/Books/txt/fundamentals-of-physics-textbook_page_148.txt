antioxidants (m1 " 1.0 kg) on a fric-
tionless inclined surface is con-
nected to a tin of corned beef (m2
2.0 kg). The pulley is massless and
frictionless. An upward force of
magnitude F " 6.0 N acts on the
corned beef tin, which has a down-
ward acceleration of 5.5 m/s2. What
are (a) the tension in the connecting
cord and (b) angle b?

The only two forces acting on a
body have magnitudes of 20 N and

Figure 5-62 is an overhead
view of a 12 kg tire that is to be
pulled by three horizontal ropes.
One rope’s force (F1 " 50 N) is in-
dicated. The forces from the other
ropes are to be oriented such that
the tire’s acceleration magnitude a is
least. What is that least a if (a) F2 "
30 N, F3 " 20 N; (b) F2 " 30 N, F3 "
10 N;and (c) F2 " F3 " 30 N?

A block of mass M is pulled
along a horizontal frictionless sur-
face by a rope of mass m, as shown
in Fig. 5-63. A horizontal force 
acts on one end of the rope.
(a) Show that the rope must sag, even if only by an imperceptible
amount. Then, assuming that the sag is negligible, find (b) the ac-
celeration of rope and block, (c) the force on the block from the
rope, and (d) the tension in the rope at its midpoint.

A worker drags a crate across a factory floor by pulling
on a rope tied to the crate. The worker exerts a force of magni-
tude F " 450 N on the rope, which is inclined at an upward angle
u " 383 to the horizontal, and the floor exerts a horizontal force
of magnitude f " 125 N that opposes the motion. Calculate the
magnitude of the acceleration of the crate if (a) its mass is 310 kg
and (b) its weight is 310 N.

In Fig. 5-64, a force 
of mag-
nitude 12 N is applied to a FedEx
box of mass m2 " 1.0 kg. The force
is directed up a plane tilted by u "
373. The box is connected by a cord
to a UPS box of mass m1 " 3.0 kg
on the floor. The floor, plane, and
pulley are frictionless,
and the
masses of the pulley and cord are negligible.What is the tension in
the cord?

Figure 5-58 shows three
blocks attached by cords that loop
over frictionless pulleys. Block B
lies on a frictionless table; the
masses are mA " 6.00 kg, mB " 8.00

blocks are released, what is the
tension in the cord at the right?

A shot putter launches a 7.260 kg shot by pushing it
along a straight line of length 1.650 m and at an angle of 34.10°
from the horizontal, accelerating the shot to the launch speed
from its initial speed of 2.500 m/s (which is due to the athlete’s
preliminary motion).The shot leaves the hand at a height of 2.110 m
and at an angle of 34.103, and it lands at a horizontal distance of
15.90 m. What is the magnitude of the athlete’s average force on
the shot during the acceleration phase? (Hint: Treat the motion
during the acceleration phase as though it were along a ramp at
the given angle.)
