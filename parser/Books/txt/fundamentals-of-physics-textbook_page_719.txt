24-2 EQUIPOTENTIAL SURFACES AND THE ELECTRIC FIELD
Figure 24-8 (a) A test charge q0 moves in a straight line from point i to point f, along the
direction of a uniform external electric field. (b) Charge q0 moves along path icf in the same
electric field.
ment 
of the test charge is perpendicular to 
. Thus, the
angle u between 
and 
is 90 , and the dot product 
is 0. Equation 24-18 then tells us that points i and c are at the
same potential: Vc ' Vi $ 0. Ah, we should have seen this
coming. The points are on the same equipotential surface,
which is perpendicular to the electric field lines.
For line cf we have u
45 and, from Eq. 24-18,
The integral in this equation is just the length of line cf;
from Fig. 24-8b, that length is d/cos 45%.Thus,
(Answer)
This is the same result we obtained in (a), as it must be;
the potential difference between two points does not de-
pend on the path connecting them. Moral: When you
want to find the potential difference between two points
by moving a test charge between them, you can save time
and work by choosing a path that simplifies the use of
Eq. 24-18.

Sample Problem 24.02
Finding the potential change from the electric field
(a) Figure 24-8a shows two points i and f in a uniform elec-
tric field 
.The points lie on the same electric field line (not
shown) and are separated by a distance d. Find the potential
difference Vf ' Vi by moving a positive test charge q0 from
i to f along the path shown, which is parallel to the field
direction.
KEY IDEA
We can find the potential difference between any two points
in an electric field by integrating 
along a path con-
necting those two points according to Eq. 24-18.
Calculations: We have actually already done the calculation
for such a path in the direction of an electric field line in a
uniform field when we derived Eq.24-21.With slight changes in
notation,Eq.24-21 gives us
Vf ' Vi $ 'Ed.
(Answer)
(b) Now find the potential difference Vf ' Vi by moving the
positive test charge q0 from i to f along the path icf shown in
Fig.24-8b.
Calculations: The Key Idea of (a) applies here too, except
now we move the test charge along a path that consists of
two lines: ic and cf. At all points along line ic, the displace-

The electric field points from
higher potential to lower potential.
The field is perpendicular to this ic path, 
so there is no change in the potential.
The field has a component
along this cf path, so there
is a  change in the potential.

Lower potential
