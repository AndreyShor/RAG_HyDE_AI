A toy chest and its contents have a combined weight of 
180 N.The coefficient of static friction between toy chest and floor
is 0.42. The child in Fig. 6-35 attempts to move the chest across the
floor by pulling on an attached rope. (a) If u is 423, what is the mag-
nitude of the force 
that the child must exert on the rope to put
the chest on the verge of moving? (b) Write an expression for the
magnitude F required to put the chest on the verge of moving as a
function of the angle u. Determine (c) the value of u for which F is
a minimum and (d) that minimum magnitude.

When the three blocks in
Fig. 6-29 are released from rest, they
accelerate with a magnitude of
0.500 m/s2. Block 1 has mass M,
block 2 has 2M, and block 3 has 2M.
What is the coefficient of kinetic
friction between block 2 and the
table?

A 4.10 kg block is pushed
along a floor by a constant applied
force that is horizontal and has a
magnitude of 40.0 N. Figure 6-30
gives the block’s speed v versus
time t as the block moves along an x
axis on the floor. The scale of the
figure’s vertical axis is set by vs "
5.0 m/s. What is the coefficient of
kinetic friction between the block
and the floor?
••25
Block B in Fig.
6-31 weighs 711 N.The coefficient of
static friction between block and
table is 0.25; angle u is 303; assume
that the cord between B and the
knot is horizontal. Find the maxi-
mum weight of block A for which
the system will be stationary.

Figure 6-32 shows three
crates being pushed over a concrete
floor by a horizontal force 
of
magnitude 440 N. The masses of the
crates are m1 " 30.0 kg, m2 " 10.0
kg, and m3 " 20.0 kg.The coefficient
of kinetic friction between the floor
and each of the crates is 0.700. (a)
What is the magnitude F32 of the
force on crate 3 from crate 2? (b) If
the crates then slide onto a polished
floor, where the coefficient of kinetic friction is less than 0.700, is
magnitude F32 more than, less than, or the same as it was when the
coefficient was 0.700?

Body A in Fig. 6-33 weighs
102 N, and body B weighs 32 N. The
coefficients of friction between A
and the incline are ms " 0.56 and
mk " 0.25. Angle u is 403. Let the
positive direction of an x axis be up
the incline. In unit-vector notation,
what is the acceleration of A if A is
initially (a) at rest, (b) moving up
the incline, and (c) moving down
the incline?
••28
In Fig. 6-33, two blocks are connected over a pulley. The
mass of block A is 10 kg, and the coefficient of kinetic friction be-
tween A and the incline is 0.20. Angle u of the incline is 303. Block
A slides down the incline at constant speed. What is the mass of
block B? Assume the connecting rope has negligible mass. (The
pulley’s function is only to redirect the rope.)

In Fig. 6-34, blocks A and B have weights of 44 N and 22
N, respectively. (a) Determine the minimum weight of block C to
keep A from sliding if ms between A and the table is 0.20. (b) Block
C suddenly is lifted off A. What is the acceleration of block A if mk
between A and the table is 0.15?

cient of kinetic friction between the lighter block and the plane is

A block is pushed across a floor by a constant force that is
applied at downward angle u (Fig. 6-19). Figure 6-36 gives the accel-
eration magnitude a versus a range of values for the coefficient of
kinetic friction mk between block and floor: a1 " 3.0 m/s2, mk2 "
