31-3 FORCED OSCILLATIONS OF THREE SIMPLE CIRCUITS
write this as
vR ! VR sin vdt.
(31-30)
From the definition of resistance (R ! V/i), we can now write the current iR in the
resistance as
(31-31)
From Eq. 31-29, we can also write this current as
iR ! IR sin(vdt ' f),
(31-32)
where IR is the amplitude of the current iR in the resistance. Comparing Eqs.
31-31 and 31-32, we see that for a purely resistive load the phase constant f ! 0°.
We also see that the voltage amplitude and current amplitude are related by
VR ! IRR
(resistor).
(31-33)
Although we found this relation for the circuit of Fig. 31-8, it applies to any
resistance in any ac circuit.
By comparing Eqs. 31-30 and 31-31, we see that the time-varying quantities
vR and iR are both functions of sin vdt with f ! 0°.Thus, these two quantities are
in phase, which means that their corresponding maxima (and minima) occur at
the same times. Figure 31-9a, which is a plot of vR(t) and iR(t), illustrates this fact.
Note that vR and iR do not decay here because the generator supplies energy to
the circuit to make up for the energy dissipated in R.
The time-varying quantities vR and iR can also be represented geometrically
by phasors. Recall from Module 16-6 that phasors are vectors that rotate around
an origin. Those that represent the voltage across and current in the resistor of
Fig. 31-8 are shown in Fig. 31-9b at an arbitrary time t. Such phasors have the
following properties:
Angular speed: Both phasors rotate counterclockwise about the origin with an
angular speed equal to the angular frequency vd of vR and iR.
Length: The length of each phasor represents the amplitude of the alternating
quantity: VR for the voltage and IR for the current.
Projection: The projection of each phasor on the vertical axis represents the
value of the alternating quantity at time t: vR for the voltage and iR for
the current.
Rotation angle: The rotation angle of each phasor is equal to the phase of the
iR ! vR
R ! VR
R  sin vdt.

For a resistive load,
the current and potential
difference are in phase.
“In phase” means
that they peak at
the same time.
Figure 31-9 (a) The current iR and the potential difference vR across the resistor are plotted
on the same graph, both versus time t.They are in phase and complete one cycle in one
period T. (b) A phasor diagram shows the same thing as (a).
