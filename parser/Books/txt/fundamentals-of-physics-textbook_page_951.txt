31-4 THE SERIES RLC CIRCUIT
denominator is zero—that is, when
or
(maximum I).
(31-66)
Because the natural angular frequency v of the RLC circuit is also equal to
the maximum value of I occurs when the driving angular frequency
matches the natural angular frequency—that is, at resonance. Thus, in an RLC
circuit, resonance and maximum current amplitude I occur when
(resonance).

Resonance Curves. Figure 31-16 shows three resonance curves for sinu-
soidally driven oscillations in three series RLC circuits differing only in R. Each
curve peaks at its maximum current amplitude I when the ratio vd/v is 1.00, but
the maximum value of I decreases with increasing R. (The maximum I is always
#m/R; to see why, combine Eqs. 31-61 and 31-62.) In addition, the curves in-
crease in width (measured in Fig. 31-16 at half the maximum value of I) with
increasing R.

Figure 31-16 Resonance curves for the
driven RLC circuit of Fig. 31-7 with 
L ! 100 mH, C ! 100 pF, and three
values of R.The current amplitude I of
the alternating current depends on how
close the driving angular frequency vd is
to the natural angular frequency v.The
horizontal arrow on each curve meas-
ures the curve’s half-width, which is the
width at the half-maximum level and is
a measure of the sharpness of the reso-
nance.To the left of vd/v ! 1.00, the cir-
cuit is mainly capacitive, with XC - XL;
to the right, it is mainly inductive, with
XL - XC.
