We next take the antilog of the far left and far right sides of
this equation. (Although the antilog 10$2.0 can be evaluated
mentally, you could use a calculator by keying in 10ˆ-2.0 or
using the 10x key.) We find
(Answer)
Thus, the earplug reduces the intensity of the sound waves
to 0.010 of their initial intensity (two orders of magnitude).

Sample Problem 17.04
Decibels, sound level, change in intensity
Many veteran rockers suffer from acute hearing damage
because of the high sound levels they endured for years.
Many rockers now wear special earplugs to protect their
hearing during performances (Fig. 17-11). If an earplug de-
creases the sound level of the sound waves by 20 dB, what is
the ratio of the final intensity If of the waves to their initial
intensity Ii?
KEY IDEA
For both the final and initial waves, the sound level b is related
to the intensity by the definition of sound level in Eq.17-29.
Calculations: For the final waves we have
,
and for the initial waves we have
.
The difference in the sound levels is
.
(17-36)
Using the identity
we can rewrite Eq. 17-36 as

17-5 SOURCES OF MUSICAL SOUND
Learning Objectives
17.26 Identify which type of pipe has even harmonics.
17.27 For any given harmonic and for a pipe with only one open
end or with two open ends, apply the relationships between
the pipe length L, the speed of sound v, the wavelength l, the
harmonic frequency f, and the harmonic number n.
After reading this module, you should be able to . . . 
17.24 Using standing wave patterns for string waves, sketch the
standing wave patterns for the first several acoustical harmon-
ics of a pipe with only one open end and with two open ends.
17.25 For a standing wave of sound, relate the distance
between nodes and the wavelength.
●Standing sound wave patterns can be set up in pipes (that
is, resonance can be set up) if sound of the proper wave-
length is introduced in the pipe.
●A pipe open at both ends will resonate at frequencies

where v is the speed of sound in the air in the pipe.
●For a pipe closed at one end and open at the other, the 
resonant frequencies are
