drop travels parallel to the x axis at constant speed vx, it
accelerates upward with some constant acceleration ay.
Calculations: Applying Newton’s second law (F ! ma) for
components along the y axis, we find that

C enters the region between
the plates, initially moving
along the x axis with speed 
vx ! 18 m/s. The length L of
each plate is 1.6 cm. The
plates are charged and thus
produce an electric field at all
points between them. Assume that field 
is downward
directed, is uniform, and has a magnitude of 1.4 $ 106 N/C.
What is the vertical deflection of the drop at the far edge
of the plates? (The gravitational force on the drop is small
relative to the electrostatic force acting on the drop and
can be neglected.)
KEY IDEA
The drop is negatively charged and the electric field is directed
downward. From Eq. 22-28, a constant electrostatic force of

22.27 For an electric dipole in an external electric field, relate
the potential energy of the dipole to the work done by a
torque as the dipole rotates in the electric field.
22.28 For an electric dipole in an external electric field, calcu-
late the potential energy by taking a dot product of the dipole
moment vector and the electric field vector, in magnitude-
angle notation and unit-vector notation.
22.29 For an electric dipole in an external electric field, iden-
tify the angles for the minimum and maximum potential en-
ergies and the angles for the minimum and maximum
torque magnitudes.

field, indicate the direction of the field, the direction of the
dipole moment, the direction of the electrostatic forces on
the two ends of the dipole, and the direction in which
those forces tend to rotate the dipole, and identify the
value of the net force on the dipole.
