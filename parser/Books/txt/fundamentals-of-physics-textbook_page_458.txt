$ 5.0 s.
(Answer)
Because T $ 0.34 s,this is about 15 periods of oscillation.
(c) How long does it take for the mechanical energy to drop
to one-half its initial value?
KEY IDEA
From Eq. 15-44, the mechanical energy at time t is kx2
m e!bt/m.
Calculations:
The mechanical energy has the value 
kx2
m at t $ 0.Thus, we must find the value of t for which
.
If we divide both sides of this equation by kx2
m and solve for
t as we did above, we find
(Answer)
This is exactly half the time we calculated in (b), or about
7.5 periods of oscillation. Figure 15-17 was drawn to illus-
trate this sample problem.

Damped harmonic oscillator, time to decay, energy
For the damped oscillator of Fig. 15-16, m $ 250 g, k $
85 N/m,and b $ 70 g/s.
(a) What is the period of the motion?
KEY IDEA
Because b &
$ 4.6 kg/s, the period is approximately
that of the undamped oscillator.
Calculation: From Eq. 15-13, we then have
(Answer)
(b) How long does it take for the amplitude of the damped
oscillations to drop to half its initial value?
KEY IDEA
The amplitude at time t is displayed in Eq. 15-42 as xm e!bt/2m.
Calculations: The amplitude has the value xm at t $ 0.Thus,
we must find the value of t for which
xm e!bt/2m $ xm.
Canceling xm and taking the natural logarithm of the equa-
tion that remains, we have ln on the right side and
ln(e!bt/2m) $ !bt/2m

15-6 FORCED OSCILLATIONS AND RESONANCE
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
15.43 Distinguish between natural angular frequency v and
driving angular frequency vd.
15.44 For a forced oscillator, sketch a graph of the oscillation
amplitude versus the ratio vd/v of driving angular fre-
quency to natural angular frequency, identify the approxi-
mate location of resonance, and indicate the effect of in-
creasing the damping constant.
15.45 For a given natural angular frequency v, identify the ap-
proximate driving angular frequency vd that gives resonance.
●If an external driving force with angular frequency vd acts
on an oscillating system with natural angular frequency v, the
system oscillates with angular frequency vd.
●The velocity amplitude vm of the system is greatest when
vd $ v,
a condition called resonance. The amplitude xm of the system
is (approximately) greatest under the same condition.

Forced Oscillations and Resonance
A person swinging in a swing without anyone pushing it is an example of free
oscillation. However, if someone pushes the swing periodically, the swing has
