CHAPTER 43
ENERGY FROM THE NUCLEUS
The Nuclear Reactor
For large-scale energy release due to fission, one fission event must trigger oth-
ers, so that the process spreads throughout the nuclear fuel like flame through a
log.The fact that more neutrons are produced in fission than are consumed raises
the possibility of just such a chain reaction, with each neutron that is produced
potentially triggering another fission. The reaction can be either rapid (as in a
nuclear bomb) or controlled (as in a nuclear reactor).
Suppose that we wish to design a reactor based on the fission of 235U by
thermal neutrons. Natural uranium contains 0.7% of this isotope, the remaining
99.3% being 238U, which is not fissionable by thermal neutrons. Let us give our-

neutrons on the right of that equation. The mass difference
for the reaction of Eq. 43-7 is
and the corresponding disintegration energy is
(Answer)
which is in good agreement with our estimate of Eq.43-6.
If the fission event takes place in a bulk solid, most of
this disintegration energy, which first goes into kinetic en-
ergy of the decay products, appears eventually as an in-
crease in the internal energy of that body, revealing itself
as a rise in temperature. Five or six percent or so of the dis-
integration energy, however, is associated with neutrinos
that are emitted during the beta decay of the primary fis-
sion fragments.This energy is carried out of the system and
is lost.

Find the disintegration energy Q for the fission event of 
Eq. 43-1, taking into account the decay of the fission frag-
ments as displayed in Eqs. 43-2 and 43-3. Some needed

KEY IDEAS
(1) The disintegration energy Q is the energy transferred
from mass energy to kinetic energy of the decay products.
(2) Q ! #)m c2, where )m is the change in mass.
Calculations: Because we are to include the decay of the
fission fragments, we combine Eqs. 43-1, 43-2, and 43-3 to
write the overall transformation as
(43-7)
Only the single neutron appears here because the initiating
neutron on the left side of Eq. 43-1 cancels one of the two
235U : 140Ce ' 94Zr ' n.
