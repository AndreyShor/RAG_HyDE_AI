RELATIVITY
for the burst; 2t is also a positive quantity because the time te
of the explosion is greater (later) than the time tb of the burst.
Planet–moon frame: We seek 2x# and 2t#, which we shall get
by transforming the given S-frame data to the planet–moon
frame S#. Because we are considering a pair of events, we
choose transformation equations from Table 37-2—namely,
Eqs.1# and 2#:
2x# ! g(2x & v 2t)
(37-27)
and
(37-28)
Here, v ! '0.980c and the Lorentz factor is
Equation 37-27 then becomes

Sample Problem 37.05
Lorentz transformations and reversing the sequence of events
An Earth starship has been sent to check an Earth outpost
on the planet P1407, whose moon houses a battle group of
the often hostile Reptulians. As the ship follows a straight-
line course first past the planet and then past the moon, it
detects a high-energy microwave burst at the Reptulian
moon base and then, 1.10 s later, an explosion at the Earth
outpost, which is 4.00 ( 108 m from the Reptulian base as
measured from the ship’s reference frame. The Reptulians
have obviously attacked the Earth outpost, and so the star-
ship begins to prepare for a confrontation with them.
(a) The speed of the ship relative to the planet and its moon
is 0.980c. What are the distance and time interval between
the burst and the explosion as measured in the planet–moon
frame (and thus according to the occupants of the stations)?
KEY IDEAS
1.
This problem involves measurements made from two
reference frames, the planet–moon frame and the star-
ship frame.
2.
We have two events: the burst and the explosion.
3.
We need to transform the given data as measured in the
starship frame to the corresponding data as measured in
the planet–moon frame.
Starship frame: Before we get to the transformation, we need
to carefully choose our notation.We begin with a sketch of the
situation as shown in Fig. 37-10. There, we have chosen the
ship’s frame S to be stationary and the planet–moon frame S#
to be moving with positive velocity (rightward).(This is an arbi-
trary choice; we could, instead, have chosen the planet–moon
frame to be stationary.Then we would redraw 
in Fig.37-10 as
being attached to the S frame and indicating leftward motion;v
would then be a negative quantity. The results would be the
same.) Let subscripts e and b represent the explosion and burst,
respectively.Then the given data, all in the unprimed (starship)
reference frame,are
2x ! xe & xb ! '4.00 ( 108 m
and
2t ! te & tb ! '1.10 s.
Here, 2x is a positive quantity because in Fig. 37-10, the co-
ordinate xe for the explosion is greater than the coordinate xb
v:

The relative motion alters the time intervals between 
events and maybe even their sequence.
Figure 37-10 A planet and its moon in reference frame S# move
rightward with speed v relative to a starship in reference frame S.
Suppose the rod is moving in frame S.This means that 2x can be identified as
the length L of the rod in frame S only if the coordinates of the rod’s end points
are measured simultaneously—that is, if 2t ! 0. If we put 2x# ! L0, 2x ! L, and
2t ! 0 in Eq. 37-25, we find
(length contraction),
(37-26)
which is exactly Eq. 37-13, the length contraction equation. Thus, length contrac-
tion is a special case of the more general Lorentz equations.
