Figure 24-26 shows four pairs of charged particles.For each pair,let
V $ 0 at infinity and consider Vnet at points on the x axis. For which
pairs is there a point at which Vnet
0 (a) between the particles and
(b) to the right of the particles? (c) At such a point is 
due to the par-
ticles equal to zero? (d) For each pair, are there off-axis points (other
than at infinity) where Vnet $ 0?

Figure 24-28 shows three paths
along which we can move the posi-
tively charged sphere A closer to
positively charged sphere B, which
is held fixed in place. (a) Would
sphere A be moved to a higher or
lower electric potential? Is the work
done (b) by our force and (c) by the
electric field due to B positive, negative, or zero? (d) Rank the
paths according to the work our force does, greatest first.

Figure 24-29 shows four arrangements of charged particles, all
the same distance from the origin. Rank the situations according to
the net electric potential at the origin, most positive first. Take the
potential to be zero at infinity.

Figure 24-30 shows a system of three charged particles. If you
move the particle of charge "q from point A to point D, are the
following quantities positive, negative, or zero: (a) the change in
the electric potential energy of the three-particle system, (b) the
work done by the net electric force on the particle you moved (that
is, the net force due to the other two particles), and (c) the work
done by your force? (d) What are the answers to (a) through (c) if,
instead, the particle is moved from B to C?

In the situation of Question 7, is the work done by your force
positive, negative, or zero if the particle is moved (a) from A to B,
(b) from A to C, and (c) from B to D? (d) Rank those moves
according to the magnitude of the work done by your force,
greatest first.

Figure 24-26 shows four pairs of charged particles with identi-
cal separations. (a) Rank the pairs according to their electric
potential energy (that is, the energy of the two-particle system),
greatest (most positive) first. (b) For each pair, if the separation be-
tween the particles is increased,
does the potential energy of the pair
increase or decrease?

(a) In Fig. 24-31a, what is the
potential at point P due to charge
Q at distance R from P? Set V $ 0
at infinity. (b) In Fig. 24-31b, the
same charge Q has been spread
uniformly over a circular arc of ra-
dius R and central angle 40%. What
is the potential at point P, the cen-
ter of curvature of the arc? (c) In
Fig. 24-31c, the same charge Q has
been spread uniformly over a circle
of radius R.What is the potential at
point P, the center of the circle?
(d) Rank the three situations
according to the magnitude of the
electric field that is set up at P,
greatest first.

In Fig. 24-33, a particle is to be released at rest at point A
and then is to be accelerated directly through point B by an elec-
tric field. The potential difference between points A and B is 100
V. Which point should be at higher electric potential if the parti-
cle is (a) an electron, (b) a proton, and (c) an alpha particle (a
nucleus of two protons and two neutrons)? (d) Rank the kinetic
energies of the particles at point B, greatest first.
