which causes the neutron to disintegrate into proton, electron, and
neutrino, relatively slowly. This law is only partly known. The so-
called strong interaction, the meson-baryon interaction, has a
strength of 1 in this scale, and the law is completely unknown, al-
though there are a number of known rules, such as that the number
of baryons does not change in any reaction.
This, then, is the horrible condition of our physics today. To
summarize it, I would say this: outside the nucleus, we seem to
know all; inside it, quantum mechanics is valid—the principles of
quantum mechanics have not been found to fail. The stage on
which we put all of our knowledge, we would say, is relativistic
space-time; perhaps gravity is involved in space-time. We do not
know how the universe got started, and we have never made exper-
iments which check our ideas of space and time accurately, below
some tiny distance, so we only know that our ideas work above that
distance. We should also add that the rules of the game are the
quantum-mechanical principles, and those principles apply, so far
as we can tell, to the new particles as well as to the old. The origin
of the forces in nuclei leads us to new particles, but unfortunately

each interaction (
means “of the order”).
