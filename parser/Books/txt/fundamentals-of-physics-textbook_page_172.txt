In Fig. 6-51, a crate slides down an inclined right-angled
trough.The coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the
trough is mk. What is the acceleration of the crate in terms of mk, u,
and g?
To three significant figures, what is the magnitude of that applied
force if it puts the block on the verge of sliding when the force is
directed (a) horizontally, (b) upward at 60.03 from the horizontal,
and (c) downward at 60.0° from the horizontal?

A box of canned goods slides down a ramp from street level
into the basement of a grocery store with acceleration 0.75 m/s2 di-
rected down the ramp. The ramp makes an angle of 403 with the
horizontal. What is the coefficient of kinetic friction between the
box and the ramp?
73
In Fig. 6-54, the coefficient of kinetic friction
between the block and inclined plane is 0.20, and
angle u is 603. What are the (a) magnitude a and
(b) direction (up or down the plane) of the block’s
acceleration if the block is sliding down the plane?
What are (c) a and (d) the direction if the block is
sent sliding up the plane?

A 110 g hockey puck sent sliding over ice is
stopped in 15 m by the frictional force on it from the ice. (a) If its ini-
tial speed is 6.0 m/s,what is the magnitude of the frictional force? (b)
What is the coefficient of friction between the puck and the ice?

A locomotive accelerates a 25-car train along a level track.
Every car has a mass of 5.0 ' 104 kg and is subject to a frictional
force f " 250v, where the speed v is in meters per second and the
force f is in newtons. At the instant when the speed of the train is
30 km/h, the magnitude of its acceleration is 0.20 m/s2. (a) What
is the tension in the coupling between the first car and the 
locomotive? (b) If this tension is equal to the maximum force the
locomotive can exert on the train, what is the steepest grade up
which the locomotive can pull the train at 30 km/h?

A house is built on the top of a hill with a nearby slope at angle 
u " 453 (Fig. 6-55).An engineering study indicates that the slope an-
gle should be reduced because the top layers of soil along the slope
might slip past the lower layers. If the coefficient of static friction be-
tween two such layers is 0.5, what is the least angle f through which
the present slope should be reduced to prevent slippage?

Engineering a highway curve. If a car goes through a curve too
fast, the car tends to slide out of the curve. For a banked curve with
friction, a frictional force acts on a fast car to oppose the tendency
to slide out of the curve; the force is directed down the bank (in the
direction water would drain). Consider a circular curve of radius 
R " 200 m and bank angle u, where the coefficient of static friction
between tires and pavement is ms. A car (without negative lift) is
driven around the curve as shown in Fig. 6-11. (a) Find an expres-
sion for the car speed vmax that puts the car on the verge of sliding
out. (b) On the same graph, plot vmax versus angle u for the range 03
to 503,
first for ms " 0.60 (dry pavement) and then for
ms " 0.050 (wet or icy pavement). In kilometers per hour, evaluate
vmax for a bank angle of u " 103 and for (c) ms " 0.60 and (d) ms "
0.050. (Now you can see why accidents occur in highway curves
when icy conditions are not obvious to drivers, who tend to drive at
normal speeds.)

A student, crazed by final exams, uses a force 
of magnitude
80 N and angle u " 703 to push a 5.0 kg block across the ceiling of
his room (Fig. 6-52). If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the
block and the ceiling is 0.40, what is the magnitude of the block’s 
acceleration?

Figure 6-53 shows a conical
pendulum, in which the bob (the
small object at the lower end of the
cord) moves in a horizontal circle at
constant speed. (The cord sweeps
out a cone as the bob rotates.) The
bob has a mass of 0.040 kg, the
string has length L " 0.90 m and
negligible mass, and the bob follows
a circular path of circumference
0.94 m. What are (a) the tension in
the string and (b) the period of the
motion?

An 8.00 kg block of steel is at
rest on a horizontal table. The co-
efficient of static friction between
the block and the table is 0.450. A
force is to be applied to the block.

What is the terminal speed of a 6.00 kg spherical ball that has
a radius of 3.00 cm and a drag coefficient of 1.60? The density of
the air through which the ball falls is 1.20 kg/m3.

A student wants to determine the coefficients of static fric-
tion and kinetic friction between a box and a plank. She places
the box on the plank and gradually raises one end of the plank.
When the angle of inclination with the horizontal reaches 303, the
box starts to slip, and it then slides 2.5 m down the plank in 4.0 s
at constant acceleration. What are (a) the coefficient of static
friction and (b) the coefficient of kinetic friction between the box
and the plank?
