Figure 26-22 gives the drift speed
vd of conduction electrons in a copper
wire versus position x along the wire.
The wire consists of three sections
that differ in radius. Rank the three
sections according to the following
quantities, greatest first: (a) radius,
(b) number of conduction electrons per cubic meter, (c) magnitude
of electric field,(d) conductivity.

Three wires, of the same diameter, are connected in turn be-
tween two points maintained at a constant potential difference.
Their resistivities and lengths are r and L (wire A), 1.2r and 1.2L
(wire B), and 0.9r and L (wire C). Rank the wires according to the
rate at which energy is transferred to thermal energy within them,
greatest first.

Figure 26-23 gives, for three
wires of radius R, the current den-
sity J(r) versus radius r, as meas-
ured from the center of a circular
cross section through the wire. The
wires are all made from the same
material. Rank the wires according
to the magnitude of the electric
field (a) at the center, (b) halfway to the surface, and (c) at the sur-
face, greatest first.

Electric Current

During the 4.0 min a 5.0 A current is set up in a wire, how
many (a) coulombs and (b) electrons pass through any cross sec-
tion across the wire’s width?

An isolated conducting sphere has a 10 cm radius. One wire
carries a current of 1.000 002 0 A into it. Another wire carries a
current of 1.000 000 0 A out of it. How long would it take for the
sphere to increase in potential by 1000 V?
••3
A charged belt, 50 cm wide, travels at 30 m/s between a source of
charge and a sphere.The belt carries charge into the sphere at a rate cor-
responding to 100 mA.Compute the surface charge density on the belt.

The (United States) National Electric Code, which sets maxi-
mum safe currents for insulated copper wires of various diameters,
is given (in part) in the table. Plot the safe current density as a
function of diameter.Which wire gauge has the maximum safe cur-
rent density? (“Gauge” is a way of identifying wire diameters, and
