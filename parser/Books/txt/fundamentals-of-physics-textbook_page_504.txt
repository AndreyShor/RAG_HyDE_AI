pulse, moving at a slower speed vt, is due to the denting. As the
projectile increases the dent’s depth, the dent increases in radius,
causing the material in the fibers to move in the same direction as the
projectile (perpendicular to the transverse pulse’s direction of
travel). The rest of the projectile’s energy goes into this motion. All
the energy that does not eventually go into permanently deforming
the fibers ends up as thermal energy.
Figure 16-48b is a graph of speed v versus time t for a bullet of
mass 10.2 g fired from a .38 Special revolver directly into body ar-
mor. The scales of the vertical and horizontal axes are set by vs #
300 m/s and ts # 40.0 ms. Take vl # 2000 m/s, and assume that the
half-angle u of the conical dent is 60-. At the end of the collision,
what are the radii of (a) the thinned region and (b) the dent (as-
suming that the person wearing the armor remains stationary)?
moving upward in the positive direction of a y axis with a trans-
verse velocity of 5.0 m/s. What are (a) the amplitude of the mo-
tion of that point and (b) the tension in the rope? (c) Write the
standing wave equation for the fundamental mode.

Two waves,
y1 # (2.50 mm) sin[(25.1 rad/m)x $ (440 rad/s)t]
and
y2 # (1.50 mm) sin[(25.1 rad/m)x " (440 rad/s)t],
travel along a stretched string. (a) Plot the resultant wave as
a function of t for x # 0, l/8, l/4, 3l/8, and l/2, where l is the
wavelength. The graphs should extend from t # 0 to a little over
one period. (b) The resultant wave is the superposition of a stand-
ing wave and a traveling wave. In which direction does the travel-
ing wave move? (c) How can you change the original waves so

Two waves are described by
y1 # 0.30 sin[p (5x $ 200t)]
and
y2 # 0.30 sin[p (5x $ 200t) " p/3],
where y1, y2, and x are in meters and t is in seconds. When these two
waves are combined, a traveling wave is produced. What are the (a)
amplitude, (b) wave speed, and (c) wavelength of that traveling wave?

A certain transverse sinu-
soidal wave of wavelength 20 cm
is moving in the positive direc-
tion of an x axis. The transverse
velocity of the particle at x # 0
as a function of time is shown in
Fig. 16-49, where the scale of
the vertical axis is set by us # 5.0 cm/s. What are the (a) wave
speed, (b) amplitude, and  (c) frequency? (d) Sketch the wave
between x # 0 and x # 20 cm at t # 2.0 s.
91
In a demonstration, a 1.2 kg horizontal rope is fixed in
SSM
the resultant wave is the superposition of standing and traveling
waves with the same amplitudes as before but with the traveling
wave moving in the opposite direction? Next, use your graphs to
find the place at which the oscillation amplitude is (d) maximum
and (e) minimum. (f) How is the maximum amplitude related to
the amplitudes of the original two waves? (g) How is the minimum
amplitude related to the amplitudes of the original two waves?
93
A traveling wave on a string is described by
where x and y are in centimeters and t is in seconds.(a) For t # 0,plot y
as a function of x for 0 2 x 2 160 cm. (b) Repeat (a) for t # 0.05 s and 
t # 0.10 s.From your graphs,determine (c) the wave speed and (d) the
direction in which the wave is traveling.

In Fig. 16-50, a circular loop of string is set
spinning about the center point in a place with
negligible gravity. The radius is 4.00 cm and the
tangential speed of a string segment is 5.00
cm/s. The string is plucked. At what speed do
transverse waves move along the string? (Hint:
Apply Newton’s second law to a small, but fi-
nite, section of the string.)

A continuous traveling wave with amplitude A is incident on
a boundary.The continuous reflection, with a smaller amplitude B,
travels back through the incoming wave.The resulting interference
pattern is displayed in Fig. 16-51. The standing wave ratio is
defined to be

The reflection coefficient R
is the ratio of the power of
the reflected wave to the
power of the incoming wave
and is thus proportional to
the ratio (B/A)2.What is the
SWR for (a) total reflection
and (b) no reflection? (c) For SWR # 1.50, what is R expressed as a

Consider a loop in the standing wave created by two
waves (amplitude 5.00 mm and frequency 120 Hz) traveling in op-
posite directions along a string with length 2.25 m and mass 125 g
and under tension 40 N. At what rate does energy enter the loop
from (a) each side and (b) both sides? (c) What is the maximum ki-
netic energy of the string in the loop during its oscillation?
