37-3 THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION
Checkpoint 2
In Fig.37-9,frame S# has velocity 0.90c relative to frame S.An observer in frame S#
measures two events as occurring at the following spacetime coordinates:event Yellow
at (5.0 m,20 ns) and event Green at (&2.0 m,45 ns). An observer in frame S wants to
find the temporal separation 2tGY ! tG & tY between the events.(a)Which equation in
Table 37-2 should be used? (b) Should '0.90c or &0.90c be substituted for v in the
parentheses on the equationâ€™s right side and in the Lorentz factor g? What value should
be substituted into the (c) first and (d) second term in the parentheses?
Some Consequences of the Lorentz Equations
Here we use the equations of Table 37-2 to affirm some of the conclusions that
we reached earlier by arguments based directly on the postulates.
Simultaneity
Consider Eq. 2 of Table 37-2,
(37-23)
If two events occur at different places in reference frame S# of Fig. 37-9, then
2x# in this equation is not zero. It follows that even if the events are simultane-
ous in S# (thus 2t# ! 0), they will not be simultaneous in frame S. (This is in
accord with our conclusion in Module 37-1.) The time interval between the
events in S will be
(simultaneous events in S#).
Thus, the spatial separation 2x# guarantees a temporal separation 2t.
Time Dilation
Suppose now that two events occur at the same place in S# (thus 2x# ! 0) but at
different times (thus 2t# " 0). Equation 37-23 then reduces to
2t ! g 2t#
(events in same place in S#).
(37-24)
This confirms time dilation between frames S and S#. Moreover, because the two
events occur at the same place in S#, the time interval 2t# between them can be
measured with a single clock, located at that place. Under these conditions,
the measured interval is a proper time interval, and we can label it 2t0 as we have
previously labeled proper times.Thus, with that label Eq. 37-24 becomes
2t ! g 2t0
(time dilation),
which is exactly Eq. 37-9, the time dilation equation.Thus, time dilation is a spe-
cial case of the more general Lorentz equations.
Length Contraction
Consider Eq. 1# of Table 37-2,
2x# ! g(2x & v 2t).
(37-25)
If a rod lies parallel to the x and x# axes of Fig. 37-9 and is at rest in reference
frame S#, an observer in S# can measure its length at leisure. One way to do so is
by subtracting the coordinates of the end points of the rod.The value of 2x# that
is obtained will be the proper length L0 of the rod because the measurements are
made in a frame where the rod is at rest.
