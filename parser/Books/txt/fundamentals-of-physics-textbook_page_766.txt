A). In Fig. 25-26, the depth d from which
the electrons come in the plate in a par-
ticular capacitor is plotted against a
range of values for the potential differ-
ence V of the battery.The density of con-
duction electrons in the copper plates is
8.49 $ 10 28 electrons/m3. The vertical
scale is set by ds ! 1.00 pm, and the hori-
zontal scale is set by Vs ! 20.0 V. What is
the ratio C/A?

Each of the uncharged capaci-
tors in Fig. 25-27 has a capacitance

Plot 1 in Fig. 25-32a gives the charge q that can be stored
on capacitor 1 versus the electric potential V set up across it. The
vertical scale is set by qs ! 16.0 mC, and the horizontal scale is set
by Vs ! 2.0 V. Plots 2 and 3 are similar plots for capacitors 2 and
3, respectively. Figure 25-32b shows a circuit with those three
capacitors and a 6.0 V battery. What is the charge stored on
capacitor 2 in that circuit?

In Fig. 25-29, a potential difference of V
100.0 V is ap-
plied across a capacitor arrangement with capacitances C1
10.0 mF,
C2
5.00 mF, and C3
4.00 mF. If capacitor 3 undergoes electrical
breakdown so that it becomes equivalent to conducting wire, what
is the increase in (a) the charge on capacitor 1 and (b) the potential
difference across capacitor 1?

Figure 25-33 shows a circuit section of four air-filled capacitors
that is connected to a larger circuit.The graph below the section shows
the electric potential V(x) as a function of position x along the lower
part of the section, through capacitor 4. Similarly, the graph above the
section shows the electric potential V(x) as a function of position x
along the upper part of the section, through capacitors 1, 2, and 3.

Two parallel-plate capacitors, 6.0 mF each, are connected in
parallel to a 10 V battery. One of the capacitors is then squeezed so
that its plate separation is 50.0% of its initial value. Because of the
squeezing, (a) how much additional charge is transferred to the ca-
pacitors by the battery and (b) what is the increase in the total
charge stored on the capacitors?

A 100 pF capacitor is charged to a potential dif-
ference of 50 V, and the charging battery is disconnected. The
capacitor is then connected in parallel with a second (initially
uncharged) capacitor. If the potential difference across the first
