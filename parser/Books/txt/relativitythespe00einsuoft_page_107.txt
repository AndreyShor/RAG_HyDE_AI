GAUSSIAN  CO-ORDINATES  89 
that  Gauss  co-ordinates  are  nothing  more  than  an 
association  of  two  sets  of  numbers  with  the  points  of 
the  surface  considered,  of  such  a  nature  that  numerical 
values  differing  very  slightly  from  each  other  are 
associated  with  neighbouring  points  "  in  space." 
So  far,  these  considerations  hold  for  a  continuum 
of  two  dimensions.  But  the  Gaussian  method  can  be 
applied  also  to  a  continuum  of  three,  four  or  more 
dimensions.  If,  for  instance,  a  continuum  of  four 
dimensions  be  supposed  available,  we  may  represent 
it  in  the  following  way.  With  every  point  of  the 
continuum  we  associate  arbitrarily  four  numbers,  xv  x2, 
X3,  #4,  which  are  known  as  "  co-ordinates."  Adjacent 
points  correspond  to  adjacent  values  of  the  co-ordinates. 
If  a  distance  ^s  is  associated  with  the  adjacent  points 
P  and  P',  this  distance  being  measurable  and  well- 
defined  from  a  physical  point  of  view,  then  the  following 
formula  holds  : 
where  the  magnitudes  gu,  etc.,  have  values  which  vary 
with  the  position  in  the  continuum.  Only  when  the 
continuum  is  a  Euclidean  one  is  it  possible  to  associate 
the  co-ordinates  xl  .  .  #4  with  the  points  of  the 
continuum  so  that  we  have  simply 
In  this  case  relations  hold  in  the  four-dimensional 
continuum  which  are  analogous  to  those  holding  in  our 
three-dimensional  measurements. 
However,  the  Gauss  treatment  for  dsz  which  we  have 
given  above  is  not  always  possible.  It  is  only  possible 
when  sufficiently  small  regions  of  the  continuum  under 
consideration  may  be  regarded  as  Euclidean  continua.
