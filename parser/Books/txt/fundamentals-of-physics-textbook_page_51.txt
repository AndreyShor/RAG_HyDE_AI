2-4 CONSTANT ACCELERATION
Checkpoint 4
The following equations give the position x(t) of a particle in four situations:(1) x "
3t $ 4; (2) x " $5t3 # 4t2 # 6; (3) x " 2/t2 $ 4/t; (4) x " 5t2 $ 3.To which of these
situations do the equations of Table 2-1 apply?
choose any initial numbers because we are looking for the
elapsed time, not a particular time in, say, the afternoon, but
let’s stick with these easy numbers.) We want the car to pass
the motorcycle,but what does that mean mathematically?
It means that at some time t, the side-by-side vehicles
are at the same coordinate: xc for the car and the sum xm1 #
xm2 for the motorcycle. We can write this statement mathe-
matically as
(2-19)
(Writing this first step is the hardest part of the problem.
That is true of most physics problems. How do you go from
the problem statement (in words) to a mathematical expres-
sion? One purpose of this book is for you to build up that
ability of writing the first step — it takes lots of practice just
as in learning, say, tae-kwon-do.) 
Now let’s fill out both sides of Eq. 2-19, left side first. To
reach the passing point at xc,the car accelerates from rest.From
Eq. 2-15 
, with x0 and v0 " 0, we have

To write an expression for xm1 for the motorcycle, we
first find the time tm it takes to reach its maximum speed vm,
using Eq. 2-11 (v " v0 # at). Substituting v0 " 0, v " vm "
58.8 m/s, and a " am " 8.40 m/s2, that time is

To get the distance xm1 traveled by the motorcycle during
the first stage, we again use Eq. 2-15 with x0 " 0 and v0 " 0,
but we also substitute from Eq. 2-21 for the time.We find

For the remaining time of 
, the motorcycle travels
at its maximum speed with zero acceleration. To get the
distance, we use Eq. 2-15 for this second stage of the motion,
but now the initial velocity is

Sample Problem 2.04
Drag race of car and motorcycle 
A popular web video shows a jet airplane, a car, and a mo-
torcycle racing from rest along a runway (Fig. 2-10). Initially
the motorcycle takes the lead, but then the jet takes the lead,
and finally the car blows past the motorcycle. Here let’s focus
on the car and motorcycle and assign some reasonable values
to the motion. The motorcycle first takes the lead because its
(constant) acceleration am " 8.40 m/s2 is greater than the car’s
(constant) acceleration ac " 5.60 m/s2, but it soon loses to the
car because it reaches its greatest speed vm " 58.8 m/s before
the car reaches its greatest speed vc " 106 m/s. How long does
the car take to reach the motorcycle?
KEY IDEAS
We can apply the equations of constant acceleration to both
vehicles, but for the motorcycle we must consider the mo-
tion in two stages: (1) First it travels through distance xm1
with zero initial velocity and acceleration am " 8.40 m/s2,
reaching speed vm " 58.8 m/s. (2) Then it travels through dis-
tance xm2 with constant velocity vm " 58.8 m/s and zero ac-
celeration (that, too, is a constant acceleration). (Note that
we symbolized the distances even though we do not know
their values. Symbolizing unknown quantities is often help-
ful in solving physics problems, but introducing such un-
knowns sometimes takes physics courage.)
Calculations: So that we can draw figures and do calcula-
tions, let’s assume that the vehicles race along the positive di-
rection of an x axis, starting from x " 0 at time t " 0. (We can
