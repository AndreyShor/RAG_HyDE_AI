CHAPTER 7
KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK
Sample Problem 7.07
Work calculated by graphical integration
In Fig. 7-13b, an 8.0 kg block slides along a frictionless floor
as a force acts on it,starting at x1 " 0 and ending at x3 " 6.5 m.
As the block moves, the magnitude and direction of the
force varies according to the graph shown in Fig. 7-13a. For
The work W done by 
while the particle moves from an initial position ri having
coordinates (xi, yi, zi) to a final position rf having coordinates (xf, yf, zf) is then
(7-36)
If 
has only an x component, then the y and z terms in Eq. 7-36 are zero and the
equation reduces to Eq. 7-32.
Work–Kinetic Energy Theorem with a Variable Force
Equation 7-32 gives the work done by a variable force on a particle in a one-
dimensional situation. Let us now make certain that the work is equal to the
change in kinetic energy, as the work–kinetic energy theorem states.
Consider a particle of mass m, moving along an x axis and acted on by a
net force F(x) that is directed along that axis. The work done on the particle
by this force as the particle moves from position xi to position xf is given by
Eq. 7-32 as
(7-37)
in which we use Newton’s second law to replace F(x) with ma. We can write the
quantity ma dx in Eq. 7-37 as
(7-38)
From the chain rule of calculus, we have
(7-39)
and Eq. 7-38 becomes
(7-40)
Substituting Eq. 7-40 into Eq. 7-37 yields
(7-41)
Note that when we change the variable from x to v we are required to express the
limits on the integral in terms of the new variable. Note also that because the
mass m is a constant, we are able to move it outside the integral.
Recognizing the terms on the right side of Eq. 7-41 as kinetic energies allows
us to write this equation as
W " Kf $ Ki " -K,
which is the work–kinetic energy theorem.

example, from x " 0 to x " 1 m, the force is positive (in
the positive direction of the x axis) and increases in mag-
nitude from 0 to 40 N. And from x " 4 m to x " 5 m, the
force is negative and increases in magnitude from 0 to 20 N.
