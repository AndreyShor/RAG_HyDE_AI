it is not really moving or even movable. We use the very small imag-
ined motion to apply the principle of conservation of energy.
Kinetic energy
To illustrate another type of energy we consider a pendulum (Fig.
4-7). If we pull the mass aside and release it, it swings back and
forth. In its motion, it loses height in going from either end to the
center. Where does the potential energy go? Gravitational energy
disappears when it is down at the bottom; nevertheless, it will climb
up again. The gravitational energy must have gone into another
form. Evidently it is by virtue of its motion that it is able to climb
up again, so we have the conversion of gravitational energy into
some other form when it reaches the bottom.
We must get a formula for the energy of motion. Now, recalling
our arguments about reversible machines, we can easily see that in
the motion at the bottom must be a quantity of energy which per-
mits it to rise a certain height, and which has nothing to do with
the machinery by which it comes up or the path by which it comes
up. So we have an equivalence formula something like the one we
wrote for the childâ€™s blocks. We have another form to represent the
energy. It is easy to say what it is. The kinetic energy at the bottom
equals the weight times the height that it could go, corresponding
to its velocity: K.E. = WH. What we need is the formula which tells
us the height by some rule that has to do with the motion of ob-
jects. If we start something out with a certain velocity, say, straight
