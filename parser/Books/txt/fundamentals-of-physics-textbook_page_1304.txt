CHAPTER 42
NUCLEAR PHYSICS
That cloud then acts as a closed conducting spherical shell
and, by Gauss’ law, has no effect on the (now internal)
charged alpha particle. Then the alpha particle “sees” only
the nuclear charge qAu. Because qa and qAu are both posi-
tively charged, a repulsive electric force acts on the alpha
particle, slowing it, and the particle–atom system has a po-
tential energy
that depends on the center-to-center separation r of the 
incoming particle and the target nucleus (Fig. 42-4b).
As the repulsive force slows the alpha particle, energy
is transferred from kinetic energy to electric potential
energy. The transfer is complete when the alpha particle
momentarily stops at the distance of closest approach d to
the target nucleus (Fig. 42-4c). Just then the kinetic energy
is Kf = 0 and the particle–atom system has the electric
potential energy
.

Sample Problem 42.01
Rutherford scattering of an alpha particle by a gold nucleus
An alpha particle with kinetic energy Ki = 5.30 MeV
happens, by chance, to be headed directly toward the nucleus
of a neutral gold atom (Fig. 42-4a). What is its distance of
closest approach d (least center-to-center separation) to the
nucleus? Assume that the atom remains stationary.
KEY IDEAS
(1) Throughout the motion, the total mechanical energy E of
the particle–atom system is conserved. (2) In addition to the
kinetic energy, that total energy includes electric potential
energy U as given by Eq.24-46 (U = q1q2/4p´0r).
Calculations: The alpha particle has a charge of +2e because
it contains two protons. The  target nucleus has a charge of
qAu = '79e because it contains 79 protons. However, that nu-
clear charge is surrounded by an electron “cloud” with a
charge of qe = #79e, and thus the alpha particle initially
“sees” a neutral atom with a net charge of qatom = 0. The
electric force on the particle is zero and the initial electric
potential energy of the particle–atom system is Ui = 0.
Once the alpha particle enters the atom, we say that it
passes through the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus.
