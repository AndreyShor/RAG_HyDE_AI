The chocolate crumb mystery.
This story begins with Problem 60 in
Chapter 23. As part of the investigation
of the biscuit factory explosion, the elec-
tric potentials of the workers were
measured as they emptied sacks of
chocolate crumb powder into the load-
ing bin,stirring up a cloud of the powder
around themselves. Each worker had an
electric potential of about 7.0 kV relative to the ground, which was
taken as zero potential. (a) Assuming that each worker was effec-
tively a capacitor with a typical capacitance of 200 pF,find the energy
stored in that effective capacitor. If a single spark between the
worker and any conducting object connected to the ground neutral-
ized the worker, that energy would be transferred to the spark.
According to measurements, a spark that could ignite a cloud of
chocolate crumb powder, and thus set off an explosion, had to have
an energy of at least 150 mJ. (b) Could a spark from a worker have
set off an explosion in the cloud of
powder in the loading bin? (The
story continues with Problem 60 in
Chapter 26.)

7.0 $ 10#2 mF and to ensure that the capacitor will be able to with-
stand a potential difference of 4.0 kV?
