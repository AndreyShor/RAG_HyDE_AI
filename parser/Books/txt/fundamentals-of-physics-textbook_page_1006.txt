CHAPTER 33
ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
Checkpoint 1
The magnetic field 
through the rectangle of Fig. 33-6 is shown at a different instant
in part 1 of the figure here;
is directed in the xz plane, parallel to the z axis, and its
magnitude is increasing. (a) Complete part 1 by drawing the induced electric fields,
indicating both directions and relative magnitudes (as in Fig. 33-6). (b) For the same
instant, complete part 2 of the figure by drawing the electric field of the electromag-
netic wave.Also draw the induced magnetic fields, indicating both directions and
relative magnitudes (as in Fig. 33-7).

33-2 ENERGY TRANSPORT AND THE POYNTING VECTOR
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
33.13 Identify that an electromagnetic wave transports
energy.
33.14 For a target, identify that an EM wave’s rate of energy
transport per unit area is given by the Poynting vector ,
which is related to the cross product of the electric field
and magnetic field .
33.15 Determine the direction of travel (and thus energy
transport) of an electromagnetic wave by applying
the cross product for the corresponding Poynting
vector.
33.16 Calculate the instantaneous rate S of energy flow of
an EM wave in terms of the instantaneous electric field
magnitude E.
33.17 For the electric field component of an electromag-
netic wave, relate the rms value Erms to the amplitude Em.

33.18 Identify an EM wave’s intensity I in terms of energy
transport.
33.19 Apply the relationships between an EM wave’s 
intensity I and the electric field’s rms value Erms and ampli-
tude Em.
33.20 Apply the relationship between average power Pavg,
energy transfer )E, and the time )t taken by that transfer,
and apply the relationship between the instantaneous
power P and the rate of energy transfer dE/dt.
33.21 Identify an isotropic point source of light.
33.22 For an isotropic point source of light, apply the relation-
ship between the emission power P, the distance r to a
point of measurement, and the intensity I at that point.
33.23 In terms of energy conservation, explain why the intensity
from an isotropic point source of light decreases as 1/r2.
