The radial and tangential accelerations are perpendicu-
lar to each other and form the components of the rider’s 
acceleration 
(Fig. 10-10b). The magnitude of

or 4.1g (which is really exciting!). All these values are 
acceptable.
To find the orientation of , we can calculate the angle u
shown in Fig. 10-10b:
tan u !
However, instead of substituting our numerical results, let’s
use the algebraic results from Eqs. 10-27 and 10-28:
u ! tan%1
.
(10-30)
The big advantage of solving for the angle algebraically is that
we can then see that the angle (1) does not depend on the
ring’s radius and (2) decreases as t goes from 0 to 2.20 s.That
is, the acceleration vector 
swings toward being radially in-
ward because the radial acceleration (which depends on t4)
quickly dominates over the tangential acceleration (which
depends on only t).At our given time t ! 2.20 s,we have

Although this is fast (111 km/h or 68.7 mi/h), such speeds are
common in amusement parks and not alarming because (as
mentioned in Chapter 2) your body reacts to accelerations but
not to velocities. (It is an accelerometer, not a speedometer.)
From Eq.10-26 we see that the linear speed is increasing as the
square of the time (but this increase will cut off at t ! 2.30 s).
Next, let’s tackle the angular acceleration by taking the
time derivative of Eq. 10-25:
a !
(3ct2) ! 6ct
! 6(6.39 $ 10%2 rad/s3)(2.20 s) ! 0.843 rad/s2.
(Answer)
The tangential acceleration then follows from Eq. 10-22:
at ! ar ! 6ctr
(10-27)
! 6(6.39 $ 10%2 rad/s3)(2.20 s)(33.1 m)
! 27.91 m/s2
27.9 m/s2,
(Answer)
or 2.8g (which is reasonable and a bit exciting). Equation 
10-27 tells us that the tangential acceleration is increasing
with time (but it will cut off at t ! 2.30 s). From Eq. 10-23,
we write the radial acceleration as
ar ! v2r.
Substituting from Eq. 10-25 leads us to
ar ! (3ct2)2r ! 9c2t4r
(10-28)
! 9(6.39 $ 10%2 rad/s3)2(2.20 s)4(33.1 m)
! 28.49 m/s2
28.5 m/s2,
(Answer)
or 2.9g (which is also reasonable and a bit exciting).

Kinetic Energy of Rotation
The rapidly rotating blade of a table saw certainly has kinetic energy due to that
rotation. How can we express the energy? We cannot apply the familiar formula
to the saw as a whole because that would give us the kinetic energy
only of the saw’s center of mass, which is zero.
