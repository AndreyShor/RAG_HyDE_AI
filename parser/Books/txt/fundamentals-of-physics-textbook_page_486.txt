Being exactly in phase,
the waves produce a
large resultant wave.
Being exactly out of
phase, they produce
a flat string.
This is an intermediate
situation, with an
intermediate result.
Figure 16-14 Two identical sinusoidal waves,
y1(x, t) and y2(x, t), travel along a string in
the positive direction of an x axis.They in-
terfere to give a resultant wave y,(x, t).
The resultant wave is what is actually
seen on the string.The phase difference f
between the two interfering waves is (a) 0
rad or 0-, (b) p rad or 180-, and (c) p rad
or 120-.The corresponding result-
ant waves are shown in (d), (e), and (f).

The two waves are shown in Fig. 16-14a, and the resultant wave is plotted in Fig.
16-14d. Note from both that plot and Eq. 16-53 that the amplitude of the resultant
wave is twice the amplitude of either interfering wave.That is the greatest ampli-
tude the resultant wave can have, because the cosine term in Eqs. 16-51 and 16-52
has its greatest value (unity) when f # 0. Interference that produces the greatest
possible amplitude is called fully constructive interference.
If f # p rad (or 180-), the interfering waves are exactly out of phase as in Fig.
16-14b.Then cos f becomes cos p/2 # 0, and the amplitude of the resultant wave
as given by Eq. 16-52 is zero.We then have, for all values of x and t,
y,(x, t) # 0
(f # p rad).
(16-54)
The resultant wave is plotted in Fig. 16-14e. Although we sent two waves along
the string, we see no motion of the string. This type of interference is called fully
destructive interference.
Because a sinusoidal wave repeats its shape every 2p rad, a phase difference
of f # 2p rad (or 360-) corresponds to a shift of one wave relative to the other
wave by a distance equivalent to one wavelength. Thus, phase differences can be
described in terms of wavelengths as well as angles. For example, in Fig. 16-14b
the waves may be said to be 0.50 wavelength out of phase.Table 16-1 shows some
other examples of phase differences and the interference they produce. Note that
when interference is neither fully constructive nor fully destructive, it is called
intermediate interference. The amplitude of the resultant wave is then interme-
diate between 0 and 2ym. For example, from Table 16-1, if the interfering waves
have a phase difference of 120- (f # p rad # 0.33 wavelength), then the result-
ant wave has an amplitude of ym, the same as that of the interfering waves
(see Figs. 16-14c and f).
Two waves with the same wavelength are in phase if their phase
difference is zero or any integer number of wavelengths.Thus, the integer part of
any phase difference expressed in wavelengths may be discarded. For example, a
phase difference of 0.40 wavelength (an intermediate interference, close to fully
destructive interference) is equivalent in every way to one of 2.40 wavelengths,
