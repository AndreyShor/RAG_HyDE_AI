Emf
An emf device does work on charges to maintain a potential
difference between its output terminals. If dW is the work the device
does to force positive charge dq from the negative to the positive ter-
minal,then the emf (work per unit charge) of the device is
(definition of #).
(27-1)
The volt is the SI unit of emf as well as of potential difference.An ideal
emf device is one that lacks any internal resistance.The potential dif-
ference between its terminals is equal to the emf. A real emf device
has internal resistance.The potential difference between its terminals
is equal to the emf only if there is no current through the device.
Analyzing Circuits
The change in potential in traversing a
resistance R in the direction of the current is #iR; in the opposite
direction it is %iR (resistance rule). The change in potential in tra-
versing an ideal emf device in the direction of the emf arrow is %#;
in the opposite direction it is ## (emf rule). Conservation of
energy leads to the loop rule:
Loop Rule.
The algebraic sum of the changes in potential encountered
in a complete traversal of any loop of a circuit must be zero.
Conservation of charge gives us the junction rule:
Junction Rule.
The sum of the currents entering any junction
must be equal to the sum of the currents leaving that junction.
Single-Loop Circuits
The current in a single-loop circuit con-
taining a single resistance R and an emf device with emf # and in-
ternal resistance r is
(27-4)
which reduces to i ! #/R for an ideal emf device with r ! 0.
Power
When a real battery of emf # and internal resistance r
does work on the charge carriers in a current i through the battery,
the rate P of energy transfer to the charge carriers is
P ! iV,

Review & Summary
where V is the potential across the terminals of the battery.The rate
Pr at which energy is dissipated as thermal energy in the battery is
Pr ! i2r.

The rate Pemf at which the chemical energy in the battery changes is
Pemf ! i#.

Series Resistances
When resistances are in series, they have
the same current. The equivalent resistance that can replace a se-
ries combination of resistances is
(n resistances in series).
(27-7)
Parallel Resistances
When resistances are in parallel,
they have the same potential difference. The equivalent resistance
that can replace a parallel combination of resistances is given by
(n resistances in parallel).

RC Circuits
When an emf # is applied to a resistance R and ca-
pacitance C in series, as in Fig. 27-15 with the switch at a, the charge
on the capacitor increases according to
q ! C#(1 # e#t/RC)
(charging a capacitor),
(27-33)
in which C# ! q0 is the equilibrium (final) charge and RC ! t is the ca-
pacitive time constant of the circuit. During the charging, the current is
(charging a capacitor).
(27-34)
When a capacitor discharges through a resistance R, the charge on
the capacitor decays according to
q ! q0e#t/RC
(discharging a capacitor).
(27-39)
During the discharging, the current is
(discharging a capacitor).

You are to connect resistors R1 and R2, with R1 ( R2, to a bat-
tery, first individually, then in series, and then in parallel. Rank
those arrangements according to the amount of current through the
battery, greatest first.
