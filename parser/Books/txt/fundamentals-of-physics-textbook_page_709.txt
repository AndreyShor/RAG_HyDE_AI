Figure 23-55 shows two non-
conducting spherical shells fixed in
place on an x axis.Shell 1 has uniform
surface charge density "4.0 mC/m2
on its outer surface and radius 0.50
cm, and shell 2 has uniform surface
charge density '2.0 mC/m2 on its
outer surface and radius 2.0 cm; the
centers are separated by L $ 6.0 cm.

A thin-walled metal spherical shell has radius 25.0 cm and
charge 2.00 ( 10 '7 C. Find E for a point (a) inside the shell, (b)

The chocolate crumb mystery. Explosions ignited by
electrostatic discharges (sparks) constitute a serious danger in fa-
cilities handling grain or powder. Such an explosion occurred in
chocolate crumb powder at a biscuit factory in the 1970s. Workers
usually emptied newly delivered sacks of the powder into a loading
bin, from which it was blown through electrically grounded plastic
pipes to a silo for storage. Somewhere along this route, two condi-
tions for an explosion were met: (1) The magnitude of an electric
field became 3.0 ( 10 6 N/C or greater, so that electrical break-
down and thus sparking could occur. (2) The energy of a spark was
150 mJ or greater so that it could ignite the powder explosively. Let
us check for the first condition in the powder flow through the
plastic pipes.
Suppose a stream of negatively charged powder was blown
through a cylindrical pipe of radius R $ 5.0 cm. Assume that the
powder and its charge were spread uniformly through the pipe
with a volume charge density r. (a) Using Gauss’ law, find an ex-
pression for the magnitude of the electric field 
in the pipe as a
function of radial distance r from the pipe center. (b) Does E in-
crease or decrease with increasing r? (c) Is 
directed radially in-
ward or outward? (d) For r $ 1.1 ( 10 '3 C/m3 (a typical value at
the factory), find the maximum E and determine where that maxi-
mum field occurs. (e) Could sparking occur, and if so, where? (The
story continues with Problem 70 in Chapter 24.)

A thin-walled metal spherical shell of radius a has a charge
qa. Concentric with it is a thin-walled metal spherical shell of radius
b + a and charge qb. Find the electric field at points a distance r from
the common center, where (a) r , a, (b) a , r , b, and (c) r + b.
(d) Discuss the criterion you would use to determine how the charges
are distributed on the inner and outer surfaces of the shells.

A particle of charge q $ 1.0 ( 10'7 C is at the center of a

Equation 23-11 (E $ s/´0) gives the electric field at points near a
charged conducting surface. Apply this equation to a conducting
sphere of radius r and charge q,and show that the electric field outside
the sphere is the same as the field of a charged particle located at the
center of the sphere.
