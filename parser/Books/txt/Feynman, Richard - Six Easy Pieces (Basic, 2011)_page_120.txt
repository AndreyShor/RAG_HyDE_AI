THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION
Planetary motions
In this chapter we shall discuss one of the most far-reaching
generalizations of the human mind. While we are admiring the
human mind, we should take some time off to stand in awe of a
nature that could follow with such completeness and generality
such an elegantly simple principle as the law of gravitation. What
is this law of gravitation? It is that every object in the universe at-
tracts every other object with a force which for any two bodies is
proportional to the mass of each and varies inversely as the square
of the distance between them. This statement can be expressed
mathematically by the equation
If to this we add the fact that an object responds to a force by ac-
celerating in the direction of the force by an amount that is in-
versely proportional to the mass of the object, we shall have said
everything required, for a sufficiently talented mathematician could
then deduce all the consequences of these two principles. However,
