18-2 THE CELSIUS AND FAHRENHEIT SCALES
We use the letters C and F to distinguish measurements and degrees on the
two scales.Thus,
0-C # 32-F
means that 0- on the Celsius scale measures the same temperature as 32- on the
Fahrenheit scale, whereas
5 C- # 9 F-
means that a temperature difference of 5 Celsius degrees (note the degree sym-
bol appears after C) is equivalent to a temperature difference of 9 Fahrenheit
degrees.
Checkpoint 1
The figure here shows three
linear temperature scales
with the freezing and boiling
points of water indicated.
(a) Rank the degrees on
these scales by size,greatest
first.(b) Rank the following
temperatures,highest first:
50-X,50-W,and 50-Y.

corresponding temperatures on the Fahrenheit scale. On the
Z scale, the difference between the boiling and freezing
points is 65.0-Z $ ($14.0-Z) # 79.0 Z-. On the Fahrenheit
scale, it is 212-F $ 32.0-F # 180 F-. Thus, a temperature dif-
ference of 79.0 Z- is equivalent to a temperature difference of
180 F- (Fig. 18-8), and we can use the ratio (180 F-)/(79.0 Z-)
as our conversion factor.
Now, since T is below the freezing point by 84.0 Z-, it
must also be below the freezing point by
Because the freezing point is at 32.0-F, this means that
T # 32.0-F $ 191 F- # $159-F.

(84.0 Z-) 180 F-
79.0 Z- # 191 F-.
Sample Problem 18.01
Conversion between two temperature scales
Suppose you come across old scientific notes that describe
a temperature scale called Z on which the boiling point of
water is 65.0-Z and the freezing point is $14.0-Z. To what
temperature on the Fahrenheit scale would a temperature
of T # $98.0-Z correspond? Assume that the Z scale is 
linear; that is, the size of a Z degree is the same everywhere
on the Z scale.
KEY IDEA
A conversion factor between two (linear) temperature
scales can be calculated by using two known (benchmark)
temperatures, such as the boiling and freezing points of wa-
ter. The number of degrees between the known tempera-
tures on one scale is equivalent to the number of degrees
between them on the other scale.
Calculations: We begin by relating the given temperature
T to either known temperature on the Z scale. Since T #
$98.0-Z is closer to the freezing point ($14.0-Z) than to the
boiling point (65.0-Z), we use the freezing point. Then we
note that the T we seek is below this point by $14.0-Z $
($98.0-Z) # 84.0 Z- (Fig. 18-8). (Read this difference as
“84.0 Z degrees.”)
Next, we set up a conversion factor between the Z
and Fahrenheit scales to convert this difference. To do so,
we use both known temperatures on the Z scale and the
