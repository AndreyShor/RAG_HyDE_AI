GENERAL  PRINCIPLE  OF  RELATIVITY  99 
For  this  reason  non-rigid  reference-bodies  are  used, 
which  are  as  a  whole  not  only  moving  in  any  way 
whatsoever,  but  which  also  suffer  alterations  in  form 
ad  lib.  during  their  motion.  Clocks,  for  which  the  law  of 
motion  is  of  any  kind,  however  irregular,  serve  for  the 
definition  of  time.  We  have  to  imagine  each  of  these 
clocks  fixed  at  a  point  on  the  non-rigid  reference-body. 
These  clocks  satisfy  only  the  one  condition,  that  the 
"  readings "  which  are  observed  simultaneously  on 
adjacent  clocks  (in  space)  differ  from  each  other  by  an 
indefinitely  small  amount.  This  non-rigid  reference- 
body,  which  might  appropriately  be  termed  a  "  reference- 
mollusk,"  is  in  the  main  equivalent  to  a  Gaussian  four- 
dimensional  co-ordinate  system  chosen  arbitrarily. 
That  which  gives  the  "mollusk"  a  certain  compre- 
hensibleness  as  compared  with  the  Gauss  co-ordinate 
system  is  the  (really  unjustified)  formal  retention  of 
the  separate  existence  of  the  space  co-ordinates  as 
opposed  to  the  time  co-ordinate.  Every  point  on  the 
mollusk  is  treated  as  a  space-point,  and  every  material 
point  which  is  at  rest  relatively  to  it  as  at  rest,  so  long  as 
the  mollusk  is  considered  as  reference-body.  The 
general  principle  of  relativity  requires  that  all  these 
mollusks  can  be  used  as  reference-bodies  with  equal 
right  and  equal  success  in  the  formulation  of  the  general 
laws  of  nature  ;  the  laws  themselves  must  be  quite 
independent  of  the  choice  of  mollusk. 
The  great  power  possessed  by  the  general  principle 
of  relativity  lies  in  the  comprehensive  limitation  which 
is  imposed  on  the  laws  of  nature  in  consequence  of  what 
we  have  seen  above.
