31-3 FORCED OSCILLATIONS OF THREE SIMPLE CIRCUITS
entiate Eq. 31-37 to find
(31-38)
We now modify Eq. 31-38 in two ways. First, for reasons of symmetry of nota-
tion, we introduce the quantity XC, called the capacitive reactance of a capacitor,
defined as
(capacitive reactance).
(31-39)
Its value depends not only on the capacitance but also on the driving angular
frequency vd. We know from the definition of the capacitive time constant 
(t ! RC) that the SI unit for C can be expressed as seconds per ohm. Applying
this to Eq. 31-39 shows that the SI unit of XC is the ohm, just as for resistance R.
Second, we replace cos vdt in Eq. 31-38 with a phase-shifted sine:
cos vdt ! sin(vdt $ 90°).
You can verify this identity by shifting a sine curve 90° in the negative direction.
With these two modifications, Eq. 31-38 becomes
(31-40)
From Eq. 31-29, we can also write the current iC in the capacitor of Fig. 31-10 as
iC ! IC sin(vdt ' f),
(31-41)
where IC is the amplitude of iC. Comparing Eqs. 31-40 and 31-41, we see that for
a purely capacitive load the phase constant f for the current is '90°. We also
see that the voltage amplitude and current amplitude are related by
VC ! ICXC
(capacitor).
(31-42)
Although we found this relation for the circuit of Fig. 31-10, it applies to any
capacitance in any ac circuit.
Comparison of Eqs. 31-36 and 31-40, or inspection of Fig. 31-11a, shows that
the quantities vC and iC are 90°, p/2 rad, or one-quarter cycle, out of phase.
Furthermore, we see that iC leads vC, which means that, if you monitored the
current iC and the potential difference vC in the circuit of Fig. 31-10, you would
find that iC reaches its maximum before vC does, by one-quarter cycle.

For a capacitive load, the
current leads the potential
difference by 90º.
“Leads” means that the
current peaks at an
earlier time than the
potential difference.
