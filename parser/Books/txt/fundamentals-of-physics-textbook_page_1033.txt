Rainbow. Figure 33-67 shows a light ray entering and
then leaving a falling, spherical raindrop after one internal reflec-
tion (see Fig. 33-21a). The final direction of travel is deviated
(turned) from the initial direction of travel by angular deviation
udev. (a) Show that udev is
udev ! 180° ' 2ui & 4ur,
where ui is the angle of incidence of the ray on the drop and ur is
the angle of refraction of the ray within the drop. (b) Using Snell’s
law, substitute for ur in terms of ui and the index of refraction n of
the water. Then, on a graphing calculator or with a computer
graphing package, graph udev versus ui for the range of possible ui
values and for n ! 1.331 for red light (at one end of the visible
spectrum) and n ! 1.333 for blue light (at the other end).
The red-light curve and the blue-light curve have different
minima, which means that there is a different angle of minimum
deviation for each color. The light of
any given color that leaves the drop
at that color’s angle of minimum de-
viation is especially bright because
rays bunch up at that angle.Thus, the
bright red light leaves the drop at
one angle and the bright blue light
leaves it at another angle.
Determine the angle of mini-
mum deviation from the udev curve

In Fig. 33-65, a light ray en-
ters a glass slab at point A at incident
angle u1
45.0° and then undergoes
total internal reflection at point B.
(The reflection at A is not shown.)
What minimum value for the index
of refraction of the glass can be in-
ferred from this information?

In Fig. 33-66, unpolarized
light with an intensity of 25 W/m2 is
sent into a system of four polarizing
sheets with polarizing directions at
angles u1 ! 40°, u2 ! 20°, u3 ! 20°,
and u4 ! 30°.What is the intensity of
the light that emerges from the system?

for (c) red light and (d) blue light. (e) If these colors form the inner
and outer edges of a rainbow (Fig. 33-21a), what is the angular
width of the rainbow?

The primary rainbow described in Problem 77 is the
type commonly seen in regions where rainbows appear. It is pro-
duced by light reflecting once inside the drops. Rarer is the sec-
ondary rainbow described in Module 33-5, produced by light
reflecting twice inside the drops (Fig. 33-68a). (a) Show that the
angular deviation of light entering and then leaving a spherical
water drop is
udev ! (180°)k ' 2ui & 2(k ' 1)ur,
where k is the number of internal reflections. Using the procedure
of Problem 77, find the angle of minimum deviation for (b) red
light and (c) blue light in a secondary rainbow. (d) What is the
angular width of that rainbow (Fig. 33-21d)?
The tertiary rainbow depends on three internal reflections
(Fig. 33-68b). It probably occurs but, as noted in Module 33-5,
cannot be seen with the eye because it is very faint and lies in the
bright sky surrounding the Sun. What is the angle of minimum de-
viation for (e) the red light and (f) the blue light in this rainbow?
(g) What is the rainbow’s angular width?

(a) Prove that a ray of light incident on the surface of a
sheet of plate glass of thickness t emerges from the opposite face
parallel to its initial direction but displaced sideways, as in Fig. 33-69.
(b) Show that, for small angles of incidence u, this displacement is
given by
where n is the index of refraction of the glass and u is measured in
radians.

An electromagnetic wave is traveling in the negative
direction of a y axis. At a particular position and time, the electric
field is directed along the positive direction of the z axis and has a
magnitude of 100 V/m. What are the (a) magnitude and (b) direc-
tion of the corresponding magnetic field?
