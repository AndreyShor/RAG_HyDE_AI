alternating quantity at time t. In Fig. 31-9b, the voltage and current are in
phase; so their phasors always have the same phase vdt and the same rotation
angle, and thus they rotate together.
Mentally follow the rotation. Can you see that when the phasors have
rotated so that vdt ! 90Â° (they point vertically upward), they indicate that just
then vR ! VR and iR ! IR? Equations 31-30 and 31-32 give the same results.
Checkpoint 3
If we increase the driving frequency in a circuit with a purely resistive load, do 
(a) amplitude VR and (b) amplitude IR increase, decrease, or remain the same?
We can leave the argument of the sine in this form for con-
venience,or we can write it as (377 rad/s)t or as (377 s'1)t.
(b) What are the current iR(t) in the resistance and the 
amplitude IR of iR(t)?
KEY IDEA
In an ac circuit with a purely resistive load, the alternating
current iR(t) in the resistance is in phase with the alternating
potential difference vR(t) across the resistance; that is, the
phase constant f for the current is zero.
Calculations: Here we can write Eq. 31-29 as
iR ! IR sin(vdt ' f) ! IR sin vdt.
(31-35)
From Eq. 31-33, the amplitude IR is
(Answer)
Substituting this and vd ! 2pfd ! 120p into Eq. 31-35, we
have
iR ! (0.180 A) sin(120pt).
(Answer)
IR ! VR
R ! 36.0 V
200 " ! 0.180 A.
Sample Problem 31.03
Purely resistive load: potential difference and current 
In Fig. 31-8, resistance R is 200 
and the sinusoidal alter-
nating emf device operates at amplitude #m ! 36.0 V and
frequency fd ! 60.0 Hz.
(a) What is the potential difference vR(t) across the resistance
as a function of time t, and what is the amplitude VR of vR(t)?
KEY IDEA
In a circuit with a purely resistive load, the potential differ-
ence vR(t) across the resistance is always equal to the potential
difference (t) across the emf device.
Calculations: For our situation, vR(t)
#(t) and VR
#m.
Since #m is given, we can write
VR ! #m ! 36.0 V.
(Answer)
To find vR(t), we use Eq. 31-28 to write
vR(t) ! #(t) ! #m sin vdt
(31-34)
and then substitute #m ! 36.0 V and
vd ! 2pfd ! 2p(60 Hz) ! 120p
to obtain
vR ! (36.0 V) sin(120pt).

A Capacitive Load
Figure 31-10 shows a circuit containing a capacitance and a generator with the
alternating emf of Eq. 31-28. Using the loop rule and proceeding as we did when
we obtained Eq. 31-30, we find that the potential difference across the capacitor is
vC ! VC sin vdt,
(31-36)
where VC is the amplitude of the alternating voltage across the capacitor. From
the definition of capacitance we can also write
qC ! CvC ! CVC sin vdt.
(31-37)
Our concern, however, is with the current rather than the charge. Thus, we differ-
