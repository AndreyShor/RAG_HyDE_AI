Total Internal Reflection
Figure 33-23a shows rays of monochromatic light from a point source S in glass
incident on the interface between the glass and air. For ray a, which is perpendi-
cular to the interface, part of the light reflects at the interface and the rest travels
through it with no change in direction.
For rays b through e, which have progressively larger angles of incidence at
the interface, there are also both reflection and refraction at the interface.As the
angle of incidence increases, the angle of refraction increases; for ray e it is 90°,
which means that the refracted ray points directly along the interface. The angle
of incidence giving this situation is called the critical angle uc. For angles of inci-
dence larger than uc, such as for rays f and g, there is no refracted ray and all the
light is reflected; this effect is called total internal reflection because all the light
remains inside the glass.
To find uc, we use Eq. 33-40; we arbitrarily associate subscript 1 with the glass
and subscript 2 with the air, and then we substitute uc for u1 and 90° for u2, which
leads to
n1 sin uc ! n2 sin 90°,

point B with a known angle at point A. Because the inter-
face through point B is parallel to that through point A,
the incident angle at B must be equal to the angle of re-
fraction u2, as shown in Fig. 33-22b. Then for reflection,
we again use the law of reflection. Thus, the angle of re-
flection at B is
(Answer)
Next, the light that passes from material 2 into the air
undergoes refraction at point B, with refraction angle u3.
Thus, we again apply Snell’s law of refraction, but this time
u#2 ! u2 ! 28.88" % 29".
33-6 TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
33.45 With sketches, explain total internal reflection and
include the angle of incidence, the critical angle, and the
relative values of the indexes of refraction on the two sides
of the interface.
33.46 Identify the angle of refraction for incidence at a
critical angle.
33.47 For a given pair of indexes of refraction, calculate the
critical angle.
Learning Objectives
●A wave encountering a boundary across which the index of refraction decreases will experience total internal reflection if the
angle of incidence exceeds a critical angle uc, where

Key Idea
we write Eq. 33-40 as
n3 sin u3 ! n2 sin u2.
(33-43)
Solving for u3 then leads to
(Answer)
Thus, the beam swings away from the normal (it was at 29°
to the normal and is now at 59°) because it moves into a ma-
terial (air) with a lower index of refraction.
