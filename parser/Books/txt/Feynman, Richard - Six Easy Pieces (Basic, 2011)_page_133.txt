That the law of gravitation is true at even bigger distances is indi-
cated in Fig. 5-8. If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no
soul. This ﬁgure shows one of the most beautiful things in the sky—
a globular star cluster. All of the dots are stars. Although they look as
if they are packed solid toward the center, that is due to the fallibility
of our instruments. Actually, the distances between even the center-
most stars are very great and they very rarely collide. There are more
stars in the interior than farther out, and as we move outward there
are fewer and fewer. It is obvious that there is an attraction among
these stars. It is clear that gravitation exists at these enormous dimen-
sions, perhaps 100,000 times the size of the solar system. Let us now
go further, and look at an entire galaxy, shown in Fig. 5-9. The shape
of this galaxy indicates an obvious tendency for its matter to agglom-
erate. Of course we cannot prove that the law here is precisely inverse
square, only that there is still an attraction, at this enormous dimen-
sion, that holds the whole thing together. One may say, “Well, that
is all very clever but why is it not just a ball?” Because it is spinning
and has angular momentum which it cannot give up as it contracts;
