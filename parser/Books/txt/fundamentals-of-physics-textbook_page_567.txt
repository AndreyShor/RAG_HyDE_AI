Temperature
•1
Suppose the temperature of a gas is 373.15 K when it is at the
boiling point of water. What then is the limiting value of the ratio
of the pressure of the gas at that boiling point to its pressure at the
triple point of water? (Assume the volume of the gas is the same at
both temperatures.)
•2
Two constant-volume gas thermometers are assembled, one
with nitrogen and the other with hydrogen. Both contain enough
gas so that p3 # 80 kPa. (a) What is the difference between the
pressures in the two thermometers if both bulbs are in boiling
water? (Hint: See Fig. 18-6.) (b) Which gas is at higher pressure?
•3
A gas thermometer is con-
structed of two gas-containing bulbs,
each in a water bath, as shown in 
Fig. 18-30.The pressure difference be-
tween the two bulbs is measured by
a mercury manometer as shown.
Appropriate reservoirs, not shown in
the diagram, maintain constant gas volume in the two bulbs.There is
no difference in pressure when both baths are at the triple point of
water. The pressure difference is 120 torr when one bath is at the
triple point and the other is at the boiling point of water.It is 90.0 torr
when one bath is at the triple point and the other is at an unknown
temperature to be measured.What is the unknown temperature?

sponds to what temperature on the X scale?

In a certain experiment, a
small radioactive source must
move at selected, extremely slow
speeds. This motion is accom-
plished by fastening the source to
one end of an aluminum rod and
heating the central section of the
rod in a controlled way. If the effective heated section of the rod
in Fig. 18-31 has length d # 2.00 cm, at what constant rate must
the temperature of the rod be changed if the source is to move at
a constant speed of 100 nm/s?
