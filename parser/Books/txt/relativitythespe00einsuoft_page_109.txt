THE  SPACE-TIME  CONTINUUM  OF  THE  SPECIAL 
THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY  CONSIDERED  AS 
A  EUCLIDEAN  CONTINUUM 
WE  are  now  in  a  position  to  formulate  more 
exactly  the  idea  of  Minkowski,  which  was 
only  vaguely  indicated  in  Section  XVII. 
,In  accordance  with  the  special  theory  of  relativity, 
certain  co-ordinate  systems  are  given  preference 
for  the  description  of  the  four-dimensional,  space-time 
continuum.  We  called  these  "  Galileian  co-ordinate 
systems."  For  these  systems,  the  four  co-ordinates 
x,  y,  z,  t,  which  determine  an  event  or — in  other 
words — a  point  of  the  four-dimensional  continuum,  are 
defined  physically  in  a  simple  manner,  as  set  forth  in 
detail  in  the  first  part  of  this  book.  For  the  transition 
from  one  Galileian  system  to  another,  which  is  moving 
uniformly  with  reference  to  the  first,  the  equations  of 
the  Lorentz  transformation  are  valid.  These  last 
form  the  basis  for  the  derivation  of  deductions  from  the 
special  theory  of  relativity,  and  in  themselves  they  are 
nothing  more  than  the  expression  of  the  universal 
validity  of  the  law  of  transmission  of  light  for  all  Galileian 
systems  of  reference. 
Minkowski  found  that  the  Lorentz  transformations 
satisfy  the  following  simple  conditions.     Let  us  consider
