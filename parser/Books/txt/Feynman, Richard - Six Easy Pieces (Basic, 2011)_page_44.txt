into the water and the water will contain air. If we suddenly take
the air away from the vessel, then the air molecules will leave more
rapidly than they come in, and in doing so will make bubbles. This
is very bad for divers, as you may know.
Now we go on to another process. In Fig. 1-6 we see, from an
atomic point of view, a solid dissolving in water. If we put a crystal
of salt in the water, what will happen? Salt is a solid, a crystal, an
organized arrangement of “salt atoms.” Figure 1-7 is an illustration
of the three-dimensional structure of common salt, sodium chlo-
ride. Strictly speaking, the crystal is not made of atoms, but of what
we call ions. An ion is an atom which either has a few extra electrons
or has lost a few electrons. In a salt crystal we ﬁnd chlorine ions
(chlorine atoms with an extra electron) and sodium ions (sodium
atoms with one electron missing). The ions all stick together by
electrical attraction in the solid salt, but when we put them in the
water we ﬁnd, because of the attractions of the negative oxygen and
positive hydrogen for the ions, that some of the ions jiggle loose. In
Fig. 1-6 we see a chlorine ion getting loose, and other atoms ﬂoating
in the water in the form of ions. This picture was made with some
care. Notice, for example, that the hydrogen ends of the water mol-
ecules are more likely to be near the chlorine ion, while near the
sodium ion we are more likely to ﬁnd the oxygen end, because the
