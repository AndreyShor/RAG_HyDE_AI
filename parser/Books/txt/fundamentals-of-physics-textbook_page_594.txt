Degrees of Freedom and Molar Specific Heats
As Table 19-2 shows, the prediction that 
agrees with experiment for
monatomic gases but fails for diatomic and polyatomic gases. Let us try to explain
the discrepancy by considering the possibility that molecules with more than one
atom can store internal energy in forms other than translational kinetic energy.
Figure 19-13 shows common models of helium (a monatomic molecule, con-
taining a single atom), oxygen (a diatomic molecule, containing two atoms), and

CHAPTER 19
THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES
●We find CV by using the equipartition of energy theorem,
which states that every degree of freedom of a molecule
(that is, every independent way it can store energy) has
associated with it—on average—an energy 
per molecule
(
per mole).

Key Ideas
KEY IDEA
Because the bubble expands, this is not a constant-volume
process. However, the helium is nonetheless confined (to the
bubble).Thus, the change Eint is the same as would occur in a
constant-volume process with the same temperature change %T.
Calculation: We can now easily find the constant-volume
change %Eint with Eq. 19-45:
(Answer)
(c) How much work W is done by the helium as it expands
against the pressure of the surrounding water during the
temperature increase?
KEY IDEAS
The work done by any gas expanding against the pressure
from its environment is given by Eq.19-11,which tells us to in-
# 1246.5 J % 1250 J.
# (5.00 mol)(1.5)(8.31 J/mol9K)(20.0 C-)
%Eint # nCV %T # n(3

%
tegrate p dV. When the pressure is constant (as here), we can
simplify that to W # p %V. When the gas is ideal (as here), we
can use the ideal gas law (Eq.19-5) to write p %V # nR %T.
Calculation: We end up with
W # nR %T
# (5.00 mol)(8.31 J/mol9K)(20.0 C-)
# 831 J.
(Answer)
Another way: Because we happen to know Q and %Eint,we can
work this problem another way: We can account for the energy
changes of the gas with the first law of thermodynamics,writing
W # Q $ %Eint # 2077.5 J $ 1246.5 J
# 831 J.
(Answer)
The transfers: Let’s follow the energy. Of the 2077.5 J
transferred to the helium as heat Q, 831 J goes into the work
W required for the expansion and 1246.5 J goes into the inter-
nal energy Eint, which, for a monatomic gas, is entirely the ki-
netic energy of the atoms in their translational motion.These
several results are suggested on the left side of Fig. 19-12.
