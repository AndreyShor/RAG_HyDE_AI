opposite directions. For negative q,

Heads up: Neglect of this effect of negative q is a very common error on exams.

the particle’s speed v (and thus it cannot change the particle’s kinetic energy).
The force can change only the direction of 
(and thus the direction of travel);
only in this sense can 
accelerate the particle.
To develop a feeling for Eq. 28-2, consider Fig. 28-3, which shows some tracks
left by charged particles moving rapidly through a bubble chamber. The chamber,
which is filled with liquid hydrogen, is immersed in a strong uniform magnetic
field that is directed out of the plane of the figure. An incoming gamma ray 
particle—which leaves no track because it is uncharged—transforms into an
electron (spiral track marked e#) and a positron (track marked e%) while it
knocks an electron out of a hydrogen atom (long track marked e#). Check with
Eq. 28-2 and Fig. 28-2 that the three tracks made by these two negative particles
and one positive particle curve in the proper directions.
Unit. The SI unit for 
that follows from Eqs. 28-2 and 28-3 is the newton
per coulomb-meter per second. For convenience, this is called the tesla (T):
Recalling that a coulomb per second is an ampere, we have

An earlier (non-SI) unit for , still in common use, is the gauss (G), and
1 tesla ! 104 gauss.

Table 28-1 lists the magnetic fields that occur in a few situations. Note that Earth’s
magnetic field near the planet’s surface is about 10#4 T (! 100 mT or 1 G).

Checkpoint 1
The figure shows three sit-
uations in which a charged
particle with velocity 
travels through a uniform
magnetic field . In each
situation, what is the di-

Magnetic Field Lines
We can represent magnetic fields with field lines, as we did for electric fields.
Similar rules apply: (1) the direction of the tangent to a magnetic field line at
any point gives the direction of 
at that point, and (2) the spacing of the lines
represents the magnitude of 
—the magnetic field is stronger where the lines
are closer together, and conversely.
