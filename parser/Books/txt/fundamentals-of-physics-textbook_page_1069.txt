An object is placed against the
center of a spherical mirror and then
moved 70 cm from it along the cen-
tral axis as the image distance i is
measured. Figure 34-48 gives i ver-
sus object distance p out to ps ! 40
cm.What is the image distance when
the object is 70 cm from the mirror?

Three-lens systems. In Fig. 34-49,
stick figure O (the object) stands on the common central axis of
three thin, symmetric lenses, which are mounted in the boxed
regions. Lens 1 is mounted within the boxed region closest to O,
which is at object distance p1. Lens 2 is mounted within the mid-
dle boxed region, at distance d12 from lens 1. Lens 3 is mounted in
the farthest boxed region, at distance d23 from lens 2. Each prob-
lem in Table 34-10 refers to a different combination of lenses and
different values for distances, which are given in centimeters. The
type of lens is indicated by C for converging and D for diverging;
the number after C or D is the distance between a lens and either
of the focal points (the proper sign of the focal distance is not
indicated).
Find (a) the image distance i3
for the (final) image produced by
lens 3 (the final image produced by
the system) and (b) the overall lat-
eral magnification M for the system,
including signs.
Also,
determine
whether the final image is (c) real
(R) or virtual (V), (d) inverted (I)
from object O or noninverted (NI), and (e) on the same side of
lens 3 as object O or on the opposite side.

The formula 1/p ' 1/i ! 1/f is called the Gaussian form
of the thin-lens formula. Another form of this formula, the
Newtonian form, is obtained by considering the distance x from the
object to the first focal point and the distance x# from the second
focal point to the image. Show that xx# ! f 2 is the Newtonian form
of the thin-lens formula.

Figure 34-50a is an overhead view of two vertical plane mir-
rors with an object O placed between them. If you look into the
SSM
mirrors, you see multiple images of O.You can find them by draw-
ing the reflection in each mirror of the angular region between the
mirrors, as is done in Fig. 34-50b for the left-hand mirror. Then
draw the reflection of the reflection. Continue this on the left and
on the right until the reflections meet or overlap at the rear of the
mirrors. Then you can count the number of images of O. How
many images of O would you see if u is (a) 90°, (b) 45°, and (c) 60°?
If u ! 120°, determine the (d) smallest and (e) largest number of
images that can be seen, depending on your perspective and the
location of O. (f) In each situation, draw the image locations and
orientations as in Fig. 34-50b.

Two thin lenses of focal lengths f1 and f2 are in contact
and share the same central axis. Show that, in image formation,
they are equivalent to a single thin lens for which the focal length is
f ! f1f2/(f1 ' f2).

Two plane mirrors are placed parallel to each other and
40 cm apart.An object is placed 10 cm from one mirror. Determine
the (a) smallest, (b) second smallest, (c) third smallest (occurs
twice), and (d) fourth smallest distance between the object and
image of the object.

In Fig. 34-51, a box is some-
where at the left, on the central axis
of the thin converging lens. The im-
age Im of the box produced by the
plane mirror is 4.00 cm “inside” the
mirror. The lens–mirror separation
is 10.0 cm, and the focal length of
the lens is 2.00 cm. (a) What is the
distance between the box and the lens? Light reflected by the mir-
ror travels back through the lens, which produces a final image of
the box. (b) What is the distance between the lens and that final
image?
