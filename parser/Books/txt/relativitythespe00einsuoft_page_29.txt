IV 
THE  GALILEIAN  SYSTEM  OF  CO-ORDINATES 
AS  
is  well  known,  the  fundamental  law  of  the 
mechanics  of  Galilei-Newton,  which  is  known 
as  the  law  of  inertia,  can  be  stated  thus  : 
A  body  removed  sufficiently  far  from  other  bodies 
continues  in  a  state  of  rest  or  of  uniform  motion 
in  a  straight  line.  This  law  not  only  says  some 
thing  about  the  motion  of  the  bodies,  but  it  also 
indicates  the  reference -bodies  or  systems  of  co 
ordinates,  permissible  in  mechanics,  which  can  be  used 
in  mechanical  description.  The  visible  fixed  stars  are 
bodies  for  which  the  law  of  inertia  certainly  holds  to  a 
high  degree  of  approximation.  Now  if  we  use  a  system 
of  co-ordinates  which  is  rigidly  attached  to  the  earth, 
then,  relative  to  this  system,  every  fixed  star  describes 
a  circle  of  immense  radius  in  the  course  of  an  astrono 
mical  day,  a  result  which  is  opposed  to  the  statement 
of  the  law  of  inertia.  So  that  if  we  adhere  to  this  law 
we  must  refer  these  motions  only  to  systems  of  co 
ordinates  relative  to  which  the  fixed  stars  do  not  move 
in  a  circle.  A  system  of  co-ordinates  of  which  the  state 
of  motion  is  such  that  the  law  of  inertia  holds  relative  to 
it  is  called  a  "  Galileian  system  of  co-ordinates."  The 
laws  of  the  mechanics  of  Galilei-Newton  can  be  regarded 
as  valid  only  for  a  Galileian  system  of  co-ordinates.
