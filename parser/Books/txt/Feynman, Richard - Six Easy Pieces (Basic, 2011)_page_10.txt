INTRODUCTION
There is a popular misconception that science is an impersonal,
dispassionate, and thoroughly objective enterprise. Whereas most
other human activities are dominated by fashions, fads, and per-
sonalities, science is supposed to be constrained by agreed rules of
procedure and rigorous tests. It is the results that count, not the
people who produce them.
This is, of course, manifest nonsense. Science is a people-driven
activity like all human endeavor, and just as subject to fashion and
whim. In this case fashion is set not so much by choice of subject
matter, but by the way scientists think about the world. Each age
adopts its particular approach to scientiﬁc problems, usually fol-
lowing the trail blazed by certain dominant ﬁgures who both set
the agenda and deﬁne the best methods to tackle it. Occasionally
scientists attain sufficient stature that they become noticed by the
general public, and when endowed with outstanding ﬂair a scientist
may become an icon for the entire scientiﬁc community. In earlier
centuries Isaac Newton was an icon. Newton personiﬁed the gen-
tleman scientist—well connected, devoutly religious, unhurried,
and methodical in his work. His style of doing science set the stan-
dard for two hundred years. In the ﬁrst half of the twentieth cen-
tury Albert Einstein replaced Newton as the popular scientist icon.
Eccentric, dishevelled, Germanic, absent-minded, utterly absorbed
in his work, and an archetypal abstract thinker, Einstein changed
the way that physics is done by questioning the very concepts that
deﬁne the subject.
Richard Feynman has become an icon for late twentieth-century
