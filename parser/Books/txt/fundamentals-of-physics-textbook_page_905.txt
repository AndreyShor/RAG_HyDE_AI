30-4 INDUCTORS AND INDUCTANCE
Substituting this and Eq. 30-23 into Eq. 30-20 (without the
minus sign) and solving for E yield
(Answer)
(30-27)
Because E is not zero here, we know that an electric field is
induced even at points that are outside the changing mag-
netic field, an important result that (as you will see in
Module 31-6) makes transformers possible.
With the given data, Eq. 30-27 yields the magnitude of

After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
30.19 Identify an inductor.
30.20 For an inductor, apply the relationship between
inductance L, total flux N0, and current i.
30.21 For a solenoid, apply the relationship between the
inductance per unit length L/l, the area A of each turn,
and the number of turns per unit length n.
Learning Objectives
●An inductor is a device that can be used to produce a known
magnetic field in a specified region. If a current i is established
through each of the N windings of an inductor, a magnetic flux
0B links those windings. The inductance L of the inductor is
(inductance defined).

Key Ideas
●The SI unit of inductance is the henry (H), where 1 henry 
1 H ! 1 T ) m2/A.
●The inductance per unit length near the middle of a long so-
lenoid of cross-sectional area A and n turns per unit length is
(solenoid).

Inductors and Inductance
We found in Chapter 25 that a capacitor can be used to produce a desired elec-
tric field. We considered the parallel-plate arrangement as a basic type of ca-
pacitor. Similarly, an inductor (symbol 
) can be used to produce a desired
magnetic field. We shall consider a long solenoid (more specifically, a short
length near the middle of a long solenoid, to avoid any fringing effects) as our
basic type of inductor.
If we establish a current i in the windings (turns) of the solenoid we are
taking as our inductor, the current produces a magnetic flux 0B through the
central region of the inductor. The inductance of the inductor is then defined in
terms of that flux as
