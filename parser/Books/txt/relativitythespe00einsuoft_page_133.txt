APPENDIX    I 
SIMPLE  DERIVATION  OF  THE  LORENTZ 
TRANSFORMATION  [SUPPLEMENTARY  TO  SEC 
TION  XI] 
FOR  the  relative  orientation  of  the  co-ordinate 
systems  indicated  in  Fig.  2,  the  #-axes  of  both 
systems   permanently  coincide.     In  the   present 
case  we  can  divide  the  problem  into  parts  by  considering 
first  only  events  which  are  localised  on  the  #-axis.    Any 
such  event  is  represented  with  respect  to  the  co-ordinate 
system  K  by  the  abscissa  x  and  the  time  t,  and  with 
respect  to  the  system  K'  by  the  abscissa  x'  and  the 
time  t'.    We  require  to  find  x'  and  t'  when  x  and  t  are 
given. 
A  light-signal,  which  is  proceeding  along  the  positive 
axis  of  x,  is  transmitted  according  to  the  equation 
x—ct 
or 
X— Ct=Q  .  .  .  (l). 
Since  the  same  light-signal  has  to  be  transmitted  relative 
to  K'  with  the  velocity  c,  the  propagation  relative  to 
the  system  K'  will  be  represented  by  the  analogous 
formula 
x'—ct'=o        ...        (2) 
Those  space-time  points  (events)  which  satisfy  (i)  must
