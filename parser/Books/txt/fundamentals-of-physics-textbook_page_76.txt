Multiplying Vectors*
There are three ways in which vectors can be multiplied, but none is exactly like
the usual algebraic multiplication. As you read this material, keep in mind that a
vector-capable calculator will help you multiply vectors only if you understand
the basic rules of that multiplication.
Multiplying a Vector by a Scalar
If we multiply a vector 
by a scalar s, we get a new vector. Its magnitude is
the product of the magnitude of 
and the absolute value of s. Its direction is the
direction of 
if s is positive but the opposite direction if s is negative.To divide 
by s, we multiply 
by 1/s.
Multiplying a Vector by a Vector
There are two ways to multiply a vector by a vector: one way produces a scalar
(called the scalar product), and the other produces a new vector (called the vector
product). (Students commonly confuse the two ways.)

Key Ideas
●The vector (or cross) product of two vectors 
and 
is 
written

and is a vector
whose magnitude c is given by
c " ab sin 4,
in which 4 is the smaller of the angles between the directions
of

defined by

and is given by a right-hand rule, as shown
in Fig. 3-19. Note that

which we may expand with the distributive law.
●In nested products, where one product is buried inside an-
other, follow the normal algebraic procedure by starting with
the innermost product and working outward.

*This material will not be employed until later (Chapter 7 for scalar products and Chapter 11 for vec-
tor products), and so your instructor may wish to postpone it.
●The product of a scalar s and a vector 
is a new vector
whose magnitude is 
and whose direction is the same as
that of 
if s is positive, and opposite that of 
if s is negative.
To divide 
by s, multiply 
by 1/s.
●The scalar (or dot) product of two vectors 
and 
is writ-
ten
"
and is the scalar quantity given by
"
" ab cos 4,
in which 4 is the angle between the directions of 
and .
A scalar product is the product of the magnitude of one vec-
tor and the scalar component of the second vector along the
direction of the first vector. In unit-vector notation,

3-3 MULTIPLYING VECTORS 
Learning Objectives
3.13 Given two vectors, use a dot product to find how much
of one vector lies along the other vector.
3.14 Find the cross product of two vectors in magnitude-
angle and unit-vector notations.
3.15 Use the right-hand rule to find the direction of the vector
that results from a cross product.
3.16 In nested products, where one product is buried inside
another, follow the normal algebraic procedure by starting
with the innermost product and working outward.
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
3.09 Multiply vectors by scalars.
3.10 Identify that multiplying a vector by a scalar gives a vec-
tor, taking the dot (or scalar) product of two vectors gives a
scalar, and taking the cross (or vector) product gives a new
vector that is perpendicular to the original two.
3.11 Find the dot product of two vectors in magnitude-angle
notation and in unit-vector notation.
3.12 Find the angle between two vectors by taking their dot prod-
uct in both magnitude-angle notation and unit-vector notation.
