CHAPTER 25
CAPACITANCE
From this we see that the threshold energy corresponds to a potential of 
! 3.9 $ 104 V.
Safety engineers attempt to keep the potential of the personnel below this level
by “bleeding” off the charge through, say, a conducting floor.
Energy Density
In a parallel-plate capacitor, neglecting fringing, the electric field has the same
value at all points between the plates. Thus, the energy density u—that is, the
potential energy per unit volume between the plates—should also be uniform.
We can find u by dividing the total potential energy by the volume Ad of the
space between the plates. Using Eq. 25-22, we obtain
(25-23)
With Eq. 25-9 (C ! ´0A/d), this result becomes
(25-24)
However,from Eq.24-42 (E ! #'V/'s),V/d equals the electric field magnitude E;so
(energy density).
(25-25)
Although we derived this result for the special case of an electric field of a
parallel-plate capacitor, it holds for any electric field. If an electric field 
ex-
ists at any point in space, that site has an electric potential energy with a den-
sity (amount per unit volume) given by Eq. 25-25.

(b) What is the energy density at the surface of the sphere?
KEY IDEA
The density u of the energy stored in an electric field
depends on the magnitude E of the field, according to 
Eq. 25-25 
.
Calculations: Here we must first find E at the surface of
the sphere, as given by Eq. 23-15:
The energy density is then

Sample Problem 25.04
Potential energy and energy density of an electric field
An isolated conducting sphere whose radius R is 6.85 cm
has a charge q ! 1.25 nC.
(a) How much potential energy is stored in the electric field
of this charged conductor?
KEY IDEAS
(1) An isolated sphere has capacitance given by Eq. 25-18
(C ! 4p´0R). (2) The energy U stored in a capacitor de-
pends on the capacitor’s charge q and capacitance C accord-
ing to Eq. 25-21 (U ! q2/2C).
Calculation: Substituting C ! 4p´0R into Eq. 25-21 gives us
