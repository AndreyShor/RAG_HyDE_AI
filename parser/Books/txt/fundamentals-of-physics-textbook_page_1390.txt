QUARKS, LEPTONS, AND THE BIG BANG
for the spin- baryons in Fig. 44-3a and for the spin-zero mesons in
Fig. 44-3b, we plot the quantity 
versus the quantity
, we get the hexagonal patterns without using
sloping axes. (The quantity Y is called hypercharge, and Tz is re-
lated to a quantity called isospin.)

Cosmology
•31
In the laboratory, one of the lines of sodium is emitted at a
wavelength of 590.0 nm. In the light from a particular galaxy,
however, this line is seen at a wavelength of 602.0 nm. Calculate
the distance to the galaxy, assuming that Hubble’s law holds and
that the Doppler shift of Eq. 37-36 applies.
•32
Because of the cosmological expansion, a particular emission
from a distant galaxy has a wavelength that is 2.00 times the wave-
length that emission would have in a laboratory. Assuming that
Hubble’s law holds and that we can apply Doppler-shift calculations,
what was the distance (ly) to that galaxy when the light was emitted?
•33
What is the observed wavelength of the 656.3 nm (first
Balmer) line of hydrogen emitted by a galaxy at a distance of
2.40 " 10 8 ly? Assume that the Doppler shift of Eq. 37-36 and
Hubble’s law apply.
•34
An object is 
from us and does not have any mo-
tion relative to us except for the motion due to the expansion of
the universe. If the space between us and it expands according to
Hubble’s law, with H ! 21.8 mm/s$ly, (a) how much extra distance
(meters) will be between us and the object by this time next year
and (b) what is the speed of the object away from us?
•35
If Hubble’s law can be extrapolated to very large distances, at
what distance would the apparent recessional speed become equal
to the speed of light?
•36
What would the mass of the Sun have to be if Pluto (the out-
ermost “planet” most of the time) were to have the same orbital
speed that Mercury (the innermost planet) has now? Use data
from Appendix C, express your answer in terms of the Sun’s cur-
rent mass MS, and assume circular orbits.
•37
The wavelength at which a thermal radiator at temperature T
radiates electromagnetic waves most intensely is given by Wien’s
law: lmax ! (2898 mm$K)/T. (a) Show that the energy E of a photon
corresponding to that wavelength can be computed from
E ! (4.28 " 10#10 MeV/K)T.
(b) At what minimum temperature can this photon create an elec-
tron–positron pair (as discussed in Module 21-3)?
•38
Use Wien’s law (see Problem 37) to answer the following
questions: (a) The cosmic background radiation peaks in intensity
at a wavelength of 1.1 mm. To what temperature does this corre-
spond? (b) About 379 000 y after the big bang, the universe became
transparent to electromagnetic radiation. Its temperature then was
1.5 " 104 ly
