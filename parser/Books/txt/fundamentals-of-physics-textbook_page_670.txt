ELECTRIC FIELDS
pattern of electric field lines around it, but here we restrict our attention to the
electric field at an arbitrary point P on the central axis, at distance z from the cen-
ter of the disk, as indicated in Fig. 22-15.
We could proceed as in the preceding module but set up a two-dimensional in-
tegral to include all of the field contributions from the two-dimensional distribu-
tion of charge on the top surface. However, we can save a lot of work with a neat
shortcut using our earlier work with the field on the central axis of a thin ring.
We superimpose a ring on the disk as shown in Fig. 22-15, at an arbitrary ra-
dius 
The ring is so thin that we can treat the charge on it as a charge ele-
ment dq. To find its small contribution dE to the electric field at point P, we
rewrite Eq. 22-16 in terms of the ring’s charge dq and radius r:
(22-22)
The ring’s field points in the positive direction of the z axis.
To find the total field at P, we are going to integrate Eq. 22-22 from the cen-
ter of the disk at r ! 0 out to the rim at r ! R so that we sum all the dE contribu-
tions (by sweeping our arbitrary ring over the entire disk surface). However, that
means we want to integrate with respect to a variable radius r of the ring.
We get dr into the expression by substituting for dq in Eq.22-22.Because the ring
is so thin, call its thickness dr.Then its surface area dA is the product of its circumfer-
ence 2pr and thickness dr.So,in terms of the surface charge density s,we have
dq ! s dA ! s (2pr dr).
(22-23)
After substituting this into Eq. 22-22 and simplifying slightly, we can sum all the
dE contributions with
(22-24)
where we have pulled the constants (including z) out of the integral. To solve
this integral, we cast it in the form

and so Eq. 22-24 becomes
(22-25)
Taking the limits in Eq. 22-25 and rearranging, we find
(charged disk)
(22-26)
as the magnitude of the electric field produced by a flat, circular, charged disk at
points on its central axis. (In carrying out the integration, we assumed that z - 0.)
If we let R : ` while keeping z finite, the second term in the parentheses in
Eq. 22-26 approaches zero, and this equation reduces to
(infinite sheet).
(22-27)
This is the electric field produced by an infinite sheet of uniform charge located
on one side of a nonconductor such as plastic. The electric field lines for such
a situation are shown in Fig. 22-4.
We also get Eq. 22-27 if we let z : 0 in Eq. 22-26 while keeping R finite.This
shows that at points very close to the disk, the electric field set up by the disk is
the same as if the disk were infinite in extent.
