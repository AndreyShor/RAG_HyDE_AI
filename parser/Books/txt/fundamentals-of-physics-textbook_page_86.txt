Rock faults are ruptures along which opposite faces of rock
have slid past each other. In Fig. 3-35, points A and B coincided be-
fore the rock in the foreground slid down to the right. The net dis-
placement 
is along the plane of the fault.The horizontal compo-
nent of 
is the strike-slip AC. The component of 
that is
directed down the plane of the fault is the dip-slip AD. (a) What is the
magnitude of the net displacement 
if the strike-slip is 22.0 m and
the dip-slip is 17.0 m? (b) If the plane of the fault is inclined at angle
52.0° to the horizontal, what is the vertical component of 
?

wise from the positive direction of the x axis of an xy coordinate
system. Also,

system. We now rotate the system counterclockwise about the origin
by 20.0° to form an x/y/ system. On this new system, what are (a)

A golfer takes three putts to get the ball into the hole. The
first putt displaces the ball 3.66 m north, the second 1.83 m south-
east, and the third 0.91 m southwest. What are (a) the magnitude

4.30 m. A fly starting at one corner flies around, ending
up at the diagonally opposite corner. (a) What is the magnitude of
its displacement? (b) Could the length of its path be less than this
magnitude? (c) Greater? (d) Equal? (e) Choose a suitable coordi-
nate system and express the components of the displacement vec-
tor in that system in unit-vector notation. (f) If the fly walks, what
is the length of the shortest path? (Hint: This can be answered
without calculus. The room is like a box. Unfold its walls to flatten
them into a plane.)

A protester carries his sign of protest, starting from the ori-
gin of an xyz coordinate system, with the xy plane horizontal. He
moves 40 m in the negative direction of the x axis, then 20 m
along a perpendicular path to his left, and then 25 m up a water
tower. (a) In unit-vector notation, what is the displacement of
the sign from start to end? (b) The sign then falls to the foot of
the tower. What is the magnitude of the displacement of the sign
from start to this new end?

A particle undergoes three successive displacements in a
plane, as follows:
4.00 m southwest; then 
5.00 m east; and
finally 
6.00 m in a direction 60.0° north of east. Choose a coor-
dinate system with the y axis pointing north and the x axis pointing
east.What are (a) the x component and (b) the y component of

successive displacements. What are (g) the x component, (h) the y
component, (i) the magnitude, and (j) the direction of the net dis-
placement? If the particle is to return directly to the starting point,
(k) how far and (l) in what direction should it move?
