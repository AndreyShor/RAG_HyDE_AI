A tunnel of length L ! 150 m, height H ! 7.2 m, and width
5.8 m (with a flat roof) is to be constructed at distance d ! 60 m
beneath the ground. (See Fig. 12-58.) The tunnel roof is to be sup-
ported entirely by square steel columns, each with a cross-sectional
area of 960 cm2. The mass of 1.0 cm3 of the ground material is 2.8 g.
(a) What is the total weight of the ground material the columns must
support? (b) How many columns are needed to keep the compres-
sive stress on each column at one-half its ultimate strength?

are forced against rigid walls at distances rA ! 7.0 cm and rB ! 4.0 cm
from the axle. Initially the stoppers touch the walls without being
compressed. Then force 
of magnitude 220 N is applied perpendi-
cular to the rod at a distance R ! 5.0 cm from the axle.Find the mag-
nitude of the force compressing (a) stopper A and (b) stopper B.

Figure 12-59 shows the
stress versus strain plot for an
aluminum wire that is stretched
by a machine pulling in opposite
directions at the two ends of the
wire. The scale of the stress axis is
set by s

7.0,
in units of
107 N/m2. The wire has an initial
length of 0.800 m and an initial
cross-sectional area of 2.00 $ 10%6
m2. How much work does the force
from the machine do on the wire to produce a strain of 1.00 $ 10%3?

In Fig.12-60,a 103 kg uni-
form log hangs by two steel wires,
A and B, both of radius 1.20 mm.
Initially, wire A was 2.50 m long
and 2.00 mm shorter than wire B.
The log is now horizontal. What
are the magnitudes of the forces
on it from (a) wire A and (b) wire
B? (c) What is the ratio dA/dB?

Figure 12-61 rep-
resents an insect caught at the mid-
point of a spider-web thread. The
thread breaks under a stress of 
8.20$108 N/m2 and a strain of
2.00. Initially, it was horizontal
and had a length of 2.00 cm and a
cross-sectional area of 8.00 $
10%12 m2. As the thread was stretched under the weight of the in-
sect, its volume remained constant. If the weight of the insect
puts the thread on the verge of breaking, what is the insect’s
mass? (A spider’s web is built to break if a potentially harmful in-
sect, such as a bumble bee, becomes snared in the web.)

After a fall, a 95 kg rock climber finds himself dangling from
the end of a rope that had been 15 m long and 9.6 mm in diameter
but has stretched by 2.8 cm. For the rope, calculate (a) the strain,
(b) the stress, and (c) the Young’s modulus.

In Fig. 12-63, a rectangular
slab of slate rests on a bedrock sur-
face inclined at angle u ! 26°. The
slab has length L ! 43 m, thickness
T ! 2.5 m, and width W ! 12 m, and
1.0 cm3 of it has a mass of 3.2 g. The
coefficient of static friction between
slab and bedrock is 0.39.
(a)
Calculate the component of the
gravitational force on the slab parallel to the bedrock surface. (b)
Calculate the magnitude of the static frictional force on the slab.
By comparing (a) and (b), you can see that the slab is in danger of
sliding. This is prevented only by chance protrusions of bedrock.
(c) To stabilize the slab, bolts are to be driven perpendicular to the
bedrock surface (two bolts are shown). If each bolt has a cross-
sectional area of 6.4 cm2 and will snap under a shearing stress of
3.6 $ 108 N/m2, what is the minimum number of bolts needed?
Assume that the bolts do not affect the normal force.

A uniform ladder whose length
is 5.0 m and whose weight is 400 N
leans against a frictionless vertical
wall. The coefficient of static friction
between the level ground and the
foot of the ladder is 0.46. What is the
greatest distance the foot of the lad-
der can be placed from the base of
the wall without the ladder immedi-
ately slipping?

In Fig. 12-64, block A
(mass 10 kg) is in equilibrium, but it
would slip if block B (mass 5.0 kg)
were any heavier. For angle u ! 30°,
what is the coefficient of static fric-
tion between block A and the sur-
face below it?
