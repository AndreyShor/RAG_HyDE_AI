Question 5.
Spring Force
The force 
from a spring is
(Hooke’s law),
(7-20)
where 
is the displacement of the spring’s free end from its posi-
tion when the spring is in its relaxed state (neither compressed nor
extended), and k is the spring constant (a measure of the spring’s
stiffness). If an x axis lies along the spring, with the origin at the lo-
cation of the spring’s free end when the spring is in its relaxed
state, Eq. 7-20 can be written as
Fx ! $kx
(Hooke’s law).
(7-21)
A spring force is thus a variable force: It varies with the
displacement of the spring’s free end.
Work Done by a Spring Force
If an object is attached to
the spring’s free end, the work Ws done on the object by the spring
force when the object is moved from an initial position xi to a final
position xf is
(7-25)
If xi ! 0 and xf ! x, then Eq. 7-25 becomes
(7-26)
Work Done by a Variable Force
When the force 
on a particle-
like object depends on the position of the object, the work done by 
on the object while the object moves from an initial position ri with co-
ordinates (xi, yi, zi) to a final position rf with coordinates (xf, yf, zf)

must be found by integrating the force. If we assume that component
Fx may depend on x but not on y or z,component Fy may depend on y
but not on x or z, and component Fz may depend on z but not on x or
y,then the work is
(7-36)
If 
has only an x component, then Eq. 7-36 reduces to
(7-32)
Power
The power due to a force is the rate at which that force
does work on an object.If the force does work W during a time inter-
val %t,the average power due to the force over that time interval is
(7-42)
Instantaneous power is the instantaneous rate of doing work:
(7-43)
For a force 
at an angle f to the direction of travel of the instan-
taneous velocity , the instantaneous power is

In three situations, a briefly applied horizontal force changes the
velocity of a hockey puck that slides over frictionless ice. The over-
head views of Fig. 7-17 indicate, for each situation, the puck’s initial
speed vi, its final speed vf, and the directions of the corresponding ve-
locity vectors. Rank the situations according to the work done on the
puck by the applied force, most positive first and most negative last.
