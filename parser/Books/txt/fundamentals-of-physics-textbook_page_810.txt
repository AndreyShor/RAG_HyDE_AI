CHAPTER 27
CIRCUITS
We can now redraw the circuit as in Fig. 27-11c; note that
the current through R23 must be i1 because charge that
moves through R1 and R4 must also move through R23. For
this simple one-loop circuit, the loop rule (applied clockwise
from point a as in Fig. 27-11d) yields
%# # i1R1 # i1R23 # i1R4 ! 0.
Substituting the given data, we find
12 V # i1(20 0) # i1(12 0) # i1(8.0 0) ! 0,
which gives us
(Answer)
(b) What is the current i2 through R2?
KEY IDEAS
(1) we must now work backward from the equivalent circuit
of Fig. 27-11d, where R23 has replaced R2 and R3. (2) Because
R2 and R3 are in parallel, they both have the same potential
difference across them as R23.
Working backward: We know that the current through R23
is i1 ! 0.30 A. Thus, we can use Eq. 26-8 (R ! V/i) and
Fig. 27-11e to find the potential difference V23 across R23.
Setting R23 ! 12 0 from (a), we write Eq. 26-8 as  
V23 ! i1R23 ! (0.30 A)(12 0) ! 3.6 V.
The potential difference across R2 is thus also 3.6 V 
(Fig. 27-11f), so the current i2 in R2 must be, by Eq. 26-8 and
Fig. 27-11g,
(Answer)
(c) What is the current i3 through R3?
KEY IDEAS
We can answer by using either of two techniques: (1) Apply
Eq. 26-8 as we just did. (2) Use the junction rule, which tells
us that at point b in Fig. 27-11b, the incoming current i1 and
the outgoing currents i2 and i3 are related by
i1 ! i2 % i3.
Calculation: Rearranging this junction-rule result yields
the result displayed in Fig. 27-11g:
i3 ! i1 # i2 ! 0.30 A # 0.18 A
! 0.12 A.
(Answer)
i2 ! V2
R2
! 3.6 V
20 0 ! 0.18 A.
i1 ! 12 V
40 0 ! 0.30 A.
Sample Problem 27.02
Resistors in parallel and in series 
Figure 27-11a shows a multiloop circuit containing one ideal
battery and four resistances with the following values:
(a) What is the current through the battery?
KEY IDEA
Noting that the current through the battery must also be
the current through R1, we see that we might find the
current by applying the loop rule to a loop that includes R1
because the current would be included in the potential
difference across R1.
Incorrect method: Either the left-hand loop or the big loop
should do. Noting that the emf arrow of the battery points
upward, so the current the battery supplies is clockwise, we
might apply the loop rule to the left-hand loop, clockwise
from point a. With i being the current through the battery,
we would get
%# # iR1 # iR2 # iR4 ! 0
(incorrect).
However, this equation is incorrect because it assumes
that R1, R2, and R4 all have the same current i. Resistances
R1 and R4 do have the same current, because the current
passing through R4 must pass through the battery and then
through R1 with no change in value. However, that current
splits at junction point bâ€”only part passes through R2, the
rest through R3.
Dead-end method: To distinguish the several currents in
the circuit, we must label them individually as in Fig. 27-11b.
Then, circling clockwise from a, we can write the loop rule
for the left-hand loop as
%# # i1R1 # i2R2 # i1R4 ! 0.
Unfortunately, this equation contains two unknowns, i1 and
i2; we would need at least one more equation to find them.
Successful method: A much easier option is to simplify
the circuit of Fig. 27-11b by finding equivalent resistances.
Note carefully that R1 and R2 are not in series and thus
cannot be replaced with an equivalent resistance.
However, R2 and R3 are in parallel, so we can use either
Eq. 27-24 or Eq. 27-25 to find their equivalent resistance
R23. From the latter,
R23 !

R2 % R3

! 12 0.
R3 ! 30 0,  R4 ! 8.0 0.
R1 ! 20 0,  R2 ! 20 0,  # ! 12 V,
