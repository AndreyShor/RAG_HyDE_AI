ATOMS IN MOTION
Introduction
This two-year course in physics is presented from the point of
view that you, the reader, are going to be a physicist. This is
not necessarily the case of course, but that is what every professor
in every subject assumes! If you are going to be a physicist, you will
have a lot to study: two hundred years of the most rapidly devel-
oping ﬁeld of knowledge that there is. So much knowledge, in fact,
that you might think that you cannot learn all of it in four years,
and truly you cannot; you will have to go to graduate school too!
Surprisingly enough, in spite of the tremendous amount of work
that has been done for all this time it is possible to condense the
enormous mass of results to a large extent—that is, to ﬁnd laws
which summarize all our knowledge. Even so, the laws are so hard
to grasp that it is unfair to you to start exploring this tremendous
subject without some kind of map or outline of the relationship of
one part of the subject of science to another. Following these pre-
liminary remarks, the ﬁrst three chapters will therefore outline the
relation of physics to the rest of the sciences, the relations of the
sciences to each other, and the meaning of science, to help us de-
velop a “feel” for the subject.
You might ask why we cannot teach physics by just giving the
basic laws on page one and then showing how they work in all
possible circumstances, as we do in Euclidean geometry, where we
