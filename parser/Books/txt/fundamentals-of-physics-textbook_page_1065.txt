PROBLEMS
uation, each problem in Table 34-4 refers to (a) the type of mirror,
(b) the focal distance f, (c) the radius of curvature r, (d) the object
distance p, (e) the image distance i, and (f) the lateral magnifica-
tion m. (All distances are in cen-
timeters.) It also refers to whether
(g) the image is real (R) or virtual
(V), (h) inverted (I) or noninverted
(NI) from O, and (i) on the same
side of the mirror as object O or on
the opposite side. Fill in the missing
information. Where only a sign is
missing, answer with the sign.

Figure 34-37 gives the lat-
eral magnification m of an object
versus the object distance p from a spherical mirror as the object is
moved along the mirror’s central axis through a range of values for
p.The horizontal scale is set by ps ! 10.0 cm.What is the magnifica-
tion of the object when the object is 21 cm from the mirror?
••31
(a) A luminous point is moving at speed vO toward a spheri-
cal mirror with radius of curvature r, along the central axis of the
mirror. Show that the image of this point is moving at speed
where p is the distance of the luminous point from the mirror at
any given time. Now assume the mirror is concave, with r ! 15 cm,

vO,
and let vO ! 5.0 cm/s. Find vI when (b) p ! 30 cm (far outside the
focal point), (c) p ! 8.0 cm (just outside the focal point), and 
(d) p ! 10 mm (very near the mirror).

Spherical Refracting Surfaces
••32 through 38
37, 38 
33, 35 Spherical refracting sur-
faces. An object O stands on the central axis of a spherical refract-
ing surface. For this situation, each problem in Table 34-5 refers to
the index of refraction n1 where the object is located, (a) the index
of refraction n2 on the other side of the refracting surface, (b) the
object distance p, (c) the radius of curvature r of the surface, and
(d) the image distance i. (All distances are in centimeters.) Fill in
the missing information, including whether the image is (e) real
(R) or virtual (V) and (f) on the same side of the surface as object
O or on the opposite side.

In Fig. 34-38, a beam of parallel light rays from a laser is in-
cident on a solid transparent sphere of index of refraction n. (a) If
a point image is produced at the
back of the sphere, what is the index
of refraction of the sphere? (b)
What index of refraction, if any, will
produce a point image at the center
of the sphere?

A glass sphere has radius
R
5.0 cm and index of refraction 1.6. A paperweight is con-
structed by slicing through the sphere along a plane that is 2.0 cm
