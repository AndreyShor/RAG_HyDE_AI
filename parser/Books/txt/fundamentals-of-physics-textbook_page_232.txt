A 60 kg skier leaves the end of a ski-jump ramp with a ve-
locity of 24 m/s directed 25# above the horizontal. Suppose that as a
result of air drag the skier returns to the ground with a speed of 22

launch to the return to the ground, by how much is the mechanical
energy of the skier–Earth system reduced because of air drag?

A large fake cookie sliding on a horizontal surface is 
attached to one end of a horizontal spring with spring constant 
k ! 400 N/m; the other end of the spring is fixed in place. The
