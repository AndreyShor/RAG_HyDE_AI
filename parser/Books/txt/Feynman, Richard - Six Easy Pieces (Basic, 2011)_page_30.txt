terested way. These people have now, I believe, a ﬁrst-rate back-
ground in physics—and they are, after all, the ones I was trying to
get at. But then, “The power of instruction is seldom of much effi-
cacy except in those happy dispositions where it is almost super-
ﬂuous.” (Gibbon)
Still, I didn’t want to leave any student completely behind, as
perhaps I did. I think one way we could help the students more
would be by putting more hard work into developing a set of prob-
lems which would elucidate some of the ideas in the lectures. Prob-
lems give a good opportunity to ﬁll out the material of the lectures
and make more realistic, more complete, and more settled in the
mind the ideas that have been exposed.
I think, however, that there isn’t any solution to this problem of
education other than to realize that the best teaching can be done
only when there is a direct individual relationship between a stu-
dent and a good teacher—a situation in which the student discusses
the ideas, thinks about the things, and talks about the things. It’s
impossible to learn very much by simply sitting in a lecture, or even
by simply doing problems that are assigned. But in our modern
times we have so many students to teach that we have to try to ﬁnd
some substitute for the ideal. Perhaps my lectures can make some
contribution. Perhaps in some small place where there are individ-
ual teachers and students, they may get some inspiration or some
ideas from the lectures. Perhaps they will have fun thinking them
through—or going on to develop some of the ideas further.
