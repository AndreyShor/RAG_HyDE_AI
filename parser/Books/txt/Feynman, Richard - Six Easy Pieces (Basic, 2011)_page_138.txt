rule to govern them, and further that man could understand it and
deduce how the planets should move! This is the reason for the success
of the sciences in following years, for it gave hope that the other phe-
nomena of the world might also have such beautifully simple laws.
What is gravity?
But is this such a simple law? What about the machinery of it? All
we have done is to describe how the earth moves around the sun,
but we have not said what makes it go. Newton made no hypotheses
about this; he was satisﬁed to ﬁnd what it did without getting into
the machinery of it. No one has since given any machinery. It is char-
acteristic of the physical laws that they have this abstract character.
The law of conservation of energy is a theorem concerning quan-
tities that have to be calculated and added together, with no men-
tion of the machinery, and likewise the great laws of mechanics are
quantitative mathematical laws for which no machinery is available.
