CHAPTER 4
MOTION IN TWO AND THREE DIMENSIONS
Uniform Circular Motion
A particle is in uniform circular motion if it travels around a circle or a circular
arc at constant (uniform) speed. Although the speed does not vary, the particle is
accelerating because the velocity changes in direction.
Figure 4-16 shows the relationship between the velocity and acceleration
vectors at various stages during uniform circular motion. Both vectors have
constant magnitude, but their directions change continuously. The velocity is
always directed tangent to the circle in the direction of motion. The accelera-
tion is always directed radially inward. Because of this, the acceleration associ-
ated with uniform circular motion is called a centripetal (meaning “center seek-
ing”) acceleration. As we prove next, the magnitude of this acceleration 
is
(centripetal acceleration),
(4-34)
where r is the radius of the circle and v is the speed of the particle.
In addition, during this acceleration at constant speed, the particle travels the
circumference of the circle (a distance of 2pr) in time
(period).
(4-35)
T is called the period of revolution, or simply the period, of the motion. It is, in
general, the time for a particle to go around a closed path exactly once.
Proof of Eq. 4-34
To find the magnitude and direction of the acceleration for uniform circular
motion, we consider Fig. 4-17. In Fig. 4-17a, particle p moves at constant speed
v around a circle of radius r. At the instant shown, p has coordinates xp and yp.
Recall from Module 4-2 that the velocity 
of a moving particle is always
tangent to the particle’s path at the particle’s position. In Fig. 4-17a, that means
is perpendicular to a radius r drawn to the particle’s position. Then the angle
u that 
makes with a vertical at p equals the angle u that radius r makes with
the x axis.
