can be obtained by using two tacks, one at each focus, a loop of
string, and a pencil; more mathematically, it is the locus of all
points the sum of whose distances from two ﬁxed points (the foci)
is a constant. Or, if you will, it is a foreshortened circle (Fig. 5-1).
Kepler’s second observation was that the planets do not go
around the sun at a uniform speed, but move faster when they are
nearer the sun and more slowly when they are farther from the sun,
in precisely this way: Suppose a planet is observed at any two suc-
cessive times, let us say a week apart, and that the radius vector* is
drawn to the planet for each observed position. The orbital arc tra-
versed by the planet during the week, and the two radius vectors,
bound a certain plane area, the shaded area shown in Fig. 5-2. If
two similar observations are made a week apart, at a part of the
orbit farther from the sun (where the planet moves more slowly),
the similarly bounded area is exactly the same as in the ﬁrst case.
So, in accordance with the second law, the orbital speed of each
planet is such that the radius “sweeps out” equal areas in equal
times.
Finally, a third law was discovered by Kepler much later; this law
is of a different category from the other two, because it deals not
with only a single planet, but relates one planet to another. This
law says that when the orbital period and orbit size of any two plan-
ets are compared, the periods are proportional to the 3/2 power of
