also  satisfy  (2).  Obviously  this  will  be  the  case  when 
the  relation 
(x'-cf)=X(x^c^  .  .        (3). 
is  fulfilled  in  general,  where  A.  indicates  a  constant  ;  for, 
according  to  (3),  the  disappearance  of  (x  —  ct)  involves 
the  disappearance  of  (x'—  ct'}. 
If  we  apply  quite  similar  considerations  to  light  rays 
which  are  being  transmitted  along  the  negative  #-axis, 
we  obtain  the  condition 
(x'+ct')=}*(x+ct)     -        •        •        (4)- 
By  adding  (or  subtracting)  equations  (3)  and  (4),  and 
introducing  for  convenience  the  constants  a  and  b  in 
place  of  the  constants  X  and  p.,  where 
and

we  obtain  the  equations 
x'  =  ax-bct\  /-\ 
ct'  =  act  -  bxj 
We  should  thus  have  the  solution  of  our  problem, 
if  the  constants  a  and  b  were  known.  These  result 
from  the  following  discussion. 
For  the  origin  of  K'  we  have  permanently  x'=o,  and 
hence  according  to  the  first  of  the  equations  (5) 
be

If  we  call  v  the  velocity  with  which  the  origin  of  K'  is 
moving  relative  to  K,  we  then  have
