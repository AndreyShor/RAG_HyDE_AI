CHAPTER 11
ROLLING, TORQUE, AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM
Checkpoint 5
The figure shows the position vector 
of a particle
at a certain instant, and four choices for the direc-
tion of a force that is to accelerate the particle.All
four choices lie in the xy plane. (a) Rank the
choices according to the magnitude of the time rate
of change 
they produce in the angular mo-
mentum of the particle about point O, greatest
first. (b) Which choice results in a negative rate of change about O?

on a particle and the angular momentum of the particle
are calculated around the same point, then the torque is re-
lated to angular momentum by Eq. 11-23 (
).
Calculations: In order to use Eq. 11-18 to find the angular
momentum about the origin, we first must find an expres-
sion for the particle’s velocity by taking a time derivative of
its position vector. Following Eq. 4-10 (
), we write

Next, let’s take the cross product of

using the
template for cross products displayed in Eq. 3-27:
Here the generic

because we really don’t want to do more work than
needed, let’s first just think about our substitutions into

Sample Problem 11.04
Torque and the time derivative of angular momentum
Figure 11-14a shows a freeze-frame of a 0.500 kg particle
moving along a straight line with a position vector given by
,
with 
in meters and t in seconds, starting at t ! 0. The posi-
tion vector points from the origin to the particle.In unit-vector 
notation, find expressions for the angular momentum 
of
the particle and the torque 
acting on the particle, both
with respect to (or about) the origin. Justify their algebraic
signs in terms of the particle’s motion.
KEY IDEAS 
(1) The point about which an angular momentum of a par-
ticle is to be calculated must always be specified. Here it is
the origin. (2) The angular momentum 
of a particle is
given by Eq. 11-18 
. (3) The sign
associated with a particle’s angular momentum is set by the
sense of rotation of the particle’s position vector (around
the rotation axis) as the particle moves: clockwise is nega-
tive and counterclockwise is positive. (4) If the torque acting

Now 
(the vector product of any vector with itself is zero because the
angle between the two vectors is necessarily zero). Thus, the last term of this 
expression is eliminated and we then have
We now use Newton’s second law 
to replace 
with its equal, the
vector sum of the forces that act on the particle, obtaining
(11-25)
Here the symbol 
indicates that we must sum the vector products 
for all
the forces. However, from Eq. 11-14, we know that each one of those vector prod-
ucts is the torque associated with one of the forces.Therefore,Eq.11-25 tells us that
This is Eq. 11-23, the relation that we set out to prove.
