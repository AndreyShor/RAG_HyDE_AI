(28-30)
We write the result this way because we know m/L, the linear
density of the wire.Substituting known data then gives us
(Answer)
This is about 160 times the strength of Earth’s magnetic field.

Learning Objectives
●Various magnetic forces act on the sections of a current-
carrying coil lying in a uniform external magnetic field, but the
net force is zero.
●The net torque acting on the coil has a magnitude given by
t ! NiAB sin u,
where N is the number of turns in the coil, A is the area of
each turn, i is the current, B is the field magnitude, and u is
the angle between the magnetic field 
and the normal
vector to the coil .

Torque on a Current Loop
Much of the world’s work is done by electric motors.The forces behind this work
are the magnetic forces that we studied in the preceding section—that is, the
forces that a magnetic field exerts on a wire that carries a current.

Sample Problem 28.06
Magnetic force on a wire carrying current
A straight, horizontal length of copper wire has a current 
i ! 28 A through it. What are the magnitude and direction
of the minimum magnetic field 
needed to suspend the
wire—that is, to balance the gravitational force on it? The
linear density (mass per unit length) of the wire is 46.6 g/m.
KEY IDEAS
(1) Because the wire carries a current, a magnetic force 
can act on the wire if we place it in a magnetic field 
. To
balance the downward gravitational force 
on the wire, we
want 
to be directed upward (Fig. 28-17). (2) The direction
of 
is related to the directions of 
and the wire’s length
vector 
by Eq. 28-26 
Calculations: Because 
is directed horizontally (and the
current is taken to be positive), Eq. 28-26 and the right-
hand rule for cross products tell us that 
must be horizon-
tal and rightward (in Fig. 28-17) to give the required
upward
