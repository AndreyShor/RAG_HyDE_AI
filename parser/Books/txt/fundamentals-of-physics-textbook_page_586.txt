After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
19.24 Explain how Maxwell’s speed distribution law is used
to find the fraction of molecules with speeds in a certain
speed range.
19.25 Sketch a graph of Maxwell’s speed distribution, show-
ing the probability distribution versus speed and indicating
the relative positions of the average speed vavg, the most
probable speed vP, and the rms speed vrms.
19.26 Explain how Maxwell’s speed distribution is used to
find the average speed, the rms speed, and the most
probable speed.
19.27 For a given temperature T and molar mass M, calcu-
late the average speed vavg, the most probable speed vP,
and the rms speed vrms.
Learning Objectives

Key Ideas
Sample Problem 19.04
Mean free path, average speed, collision frequency
(a) What is the mean free path l for oxygen molecules at
temperature T # 300 K and pressure p # 1.0 atm? Assume
that the molecular diameter is d # 290 pm and the gas is
ideal.
KEY IDEA
Each oxygen molecule moves among other moving oxygen
molecules in a zigzag path due to the resulting collisions.Thus,
we use Eq.19-25 for the mean free path.
Calculation: We first need the number of molecules per unit
volume, N/V. Because we assume the gas is ideal, we can use
the ideal gas law of Eq. 19-9 (pV
NkT) to write N/V
p/kT. Substituting this into Eq.19-25,we find
# 1.1 ' 10$7 m.
(Answer)
This is about 380 molecular diameters.
(b) Assume the average speed of the oxygen molecules is 
v # 450 m/s. What is the average time t between successive

collisions for any given molecule? At what rate does
the molecule collide; that is, what is the frequency f of its
collisions?
KEY IDEAS
(1) Between collisions, the molecule travels, on average, the
mean free path l at speed v. (2) The average rate or fre-
quency at which the collisions occur is the inverse of the
time t between collisions.
Calculations: From the first key idea, the average time
between collisions is
# 2.44 ' 10$10 s % 0.24 ns.
(Answer)
This tells us that, on average, any given oxygen molecule has
less than a nanosecond between collisions.
From the second key idea, the collision frequency is
(Answer)
This tells us that, on average, any given oxygen molecule
makes about 4 billion collisions per second.
