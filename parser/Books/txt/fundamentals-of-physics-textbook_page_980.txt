Spin magnetic dipole moments of electrons and other elementary particles can
be expressed in terms of mB. For an electron, the magnitude of the measured z
component of 
is
! 1mB.
(32-26)
(The quantum physics of the electron, called quantum electrodynamics, or QED,
reveals that ms,z is actually slightly greater than 1mB, but we shall neglect that fact.)
Energy. When an electron is placed in an external magnetic field 
, an
energy U can be associated with the orientation of the electron’s spin magnetic
dipole moment 
just as an energy can be associated with the orientation of the
magnetic dipole moment 
of a current loop placed in 
. From Eq. 28-38, the
orientation energy for the electron is
(32-27)
where the z axis is taken to be in the direction of 
.
If we imagine an electron to be a microscopic sphere (which it is not), we can
represent the spin , the spin magnetic dipole moment 
, and the associated
magnetic dipole field as in Fig. 32-10.Although we use the word “spin” here, elec-
trons do not spin like tops. How, then, can something have angular momentum
without actually rotating? Again, we would need quantum physics to provide the
answer.
Protons and neutrons also have an intrinsic angular momentum called spin
and an associated intrinsic spin magnetic dipole moment. For a proton those two
vectors have the same direction, and for a neutron they have opposite directions.
We shall not examine the contributions of these dipole moments to the magnetic
fields of atoms because they are about a thousand times smaller than that due to
an electron.

The figure here shows the spin orientations of two particles
in an external magnetic field 
. (a) If the particles are
electrons, which spin orientation is at lower energy? (b) If,
instead, the particles are protons, which spin orientation is at
lower energy?

Orbital Magnetic Dipole Moment
When it is in an atom, an electron has an additional angular momentum called
its orbital angular momentum
. Associated with 
is an orbital magnetic
dipole moment
; the two are related by
(32-28)
The minus sign means that 
and 
have opposite directions.
Orbital angular momentum 
cannot be measured; only its component
along any axis can be measured, and that component is quantized. The compo-
nent along, say, a z axis can have only the values given by
(32-29)
in which 
is called the orbital magnetic quantum number and “limit” refers to
some largest allowed integer value for 
.The signs in Eq. 32-29 have to do with
the direction of Lorb,z along the z axis.
