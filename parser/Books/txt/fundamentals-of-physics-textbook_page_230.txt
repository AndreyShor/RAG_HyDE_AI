Tarzan, who weighs 688 N,
swings from a cliff at the end of a vine
18 m long (Fig. 8-40). From the top of
the cliff to the bottom of the swing,he
descends by 3.2 m.The vine will break
if the force on it exceeds 950 N.
(a) Does the vine break? (b) If no,
what is the greatest force on it during
the swing? If yes, at what angle with
the vertical does it break?

A 60 kg skier starts from rest at height H ! 20 m above
the end of a ski-jump ramp (Fig. 8-37) and leaves the ramp at angle
u ! 28#. Neglect the effects of air resistance and assume the ramp
is frictionless. (a) What is the maximum height h of his jump above
the end of the ramp? (b) If he increased his weight by putting on a
backpack, would h then be greater, less, or the same?

Figure 8-41a applies to the spring
in a cork gun (Fig. 8-41b); it shows the
spring force as a function of the stretch or
compression of the spring. The spring is
compressed by 5.5 cm and used to propel
a 3.8 g cork from the gun. (a) What is the
speed of the cork if it is released as the
spring passes through its relaxed posi-
tion? (b) Suppose, instead, that the cork
sticks to the spring and stretches it 1.5 cm
before separation occurs.What now is the
speed of the cork at the time of release?

Below the block is a spring that can be
compressed 2.0 cm by a force of 270 N.
The block momentarily stops when
it compresses the spring by 5.5 cm.
(a) How far does the block move
down the incline from its rest posi-
tion to this stopping point? (b) What
is the speed of the block just as it
touches the spring?
