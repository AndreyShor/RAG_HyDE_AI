Important. Note two features here: (1) angular momentum has meaning
only with respect to a specified origin and (2) its direction is always perpendicu-
lar to the plane formed by the position and linear momentum vectors

Checkpoint 4
In part a of the figure, particles 1 and 2 move around point O in circles
with radii 2 m and 4 m. In part b, particles 3 and 4 travel along straight
lines at perpendicular distances of 4 m and 2 m from point O. Particle 5
moves directly away from O.All five particles have the same mass and
the same constant speed. (a) Rank the particles according to the magni-
tudes of their angular momentum about point O, greatest first. (b)

Similarly, the magnitude of

negative direction, consistent with the clockwise rotation of
around O as particle 2 moves. Thus, the angular momen-

Sample Problem 11.03
Angular momentum of a two-particle system
Figure 11-13 shows an overhead view of two particles moving
at constant momentum along horizontal paths. Particle 1, with
momentum magnitude p1 ! 5.0 kg)m/s, has position vector 
and will pass 2.0 m from point O. Particle 2, with momentum
magnitude p2 ! 2.0 kg)m/s,has position vector 
and will pass
4.0 m from point O. What are the magnitude and direction of
the net angular momentum 
about point O of the two-
particle system?
KEY IDEA
To find , we can first find the individual angular momenta
and 
and then add them.To evaluate their magnitudes,
we can use any one of Eqs. 11-18 through 11-21. However,
Eq. 11-21 is easiest, because we are given the perpendicular
distances 
and 
and the momen-
tum magnitudes p1 and p2.
Calculations: For particle 1, Eq. 11-21 yields
To find the direction of vector 
, we use Eq. 11-18 and the
right-hand rule for vector products. For 
, the vector
product is out of the page, perpendicular to the plane of
Fig. 11-13. This is the positive direction, consistent with the
counterclockwise rotation of the particle’s position vector
