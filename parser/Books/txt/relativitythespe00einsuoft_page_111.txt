THE  SPACE -TIME  CONTINUUM  OF  THE 
GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY  IS 
NOT  A  EUCLIDEAN  CONTINUUM 
IN  
the  first  part  of  this  book  we  were  able  to  make  use 
of  space-time  co-ordinates  which  allowed  of  a  simple 
and  direct  physical  interpretation,  and  which,  accord 
ing  to  Section  XXVI,  can  be  regarded  as  four-dimensional 
Cartesian  co-ordinates.  This  was  possible  on  the  basis 
of  the  law  of  the  constancy  of  the  velocity  of  light.  But 
according  to  Section  XXI,  the  general  theory  of  relativity 
cannot  retain  this  law.  On  the  contrary,  we  arrived  at 
the  result  that  according  to  this  latter  theory  the 
velocity  of  light  must  always  depend  on  the  co-ordinates 
when  a  gravitational  field  is  present.  In  connection 
with  a  specific  illustration  in  Section  XXIII,  we  found 
that  the  presence  of  a  gravitational  field  invalidates  the 
definition  of  the  co-ordinates  and  the  time,  which  led  us 
to  our  objective  in  the  special  theory  of  relativity. 
In  view  of  the  results  of  these  considerations  we  are 
led  to  the  conviction  that,  according  to  the  general 
principle  of  relativity,  the  space-time  continuum  cannot 
be  regarded  as  a  Euclidean  one,  but  that  here  we  have 
the  general  case,  corresponding  to  the  marble  slab  with 
local  variations  of  temperature,  and  with  which  we 
made  acquaintance  as  an  example  of  a  two-dimensional
