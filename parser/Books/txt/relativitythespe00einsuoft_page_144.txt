which  the  radius  sun-planet  exceeds  this  angle  during 
the  interval  between  one  perihelion  and  the  next.) 
In  this  expression  a  represents  the  major  semi-axis  of 
the  ellipse,  e  its  eccentricity,  c  the  velocity  of  light,  and 
T  the  period  of  revolution  of  the  planet.  Our  result 
may  also  be  stated  as  follows  :  According  to  the  general 
theory  of  relativity,  the  major  axis  of  the  ellipse  rotates 
round  the  sun  in  the  same  sense  as  the  orbital  motion 
of  the  planet.  Theory  requires  that  this  rotation  should 
amount  to  43  seconds  of  arc  per  century  for  the  planet 
Mercury,  but  for  the  other  planets  of  our  solar  system  its 
magnitude  should  be  so  small  that  it  would  necessarily 
escape  detection.1 
In  point  of  fact,  astronomers  have  found  that  the 
theory  of  Newton  does  not  suffice  to  calculate  the 
observed  motion  of  Mercury  with  an  exactness  cor 
responding  to  that  of  the  delicacy  of  observation  attain 
able  at  the  present  time.  After  taking  account  of  all 
the  disturbing  influences  exerted  on  Mercury  by  the 
remaining  planets,  it  was  found  (Leverrier — 1859 — 
and  Newcomb — 1895)  that  an  unexplained  perihelial 
movement  of  the  orbit  of  Mercury  remained  over,  the 
amount  of  which  does  not  differ  sensibly  from  the  above- 
mentioned  +43  seconds  of  arc  per  century.  The  un 
certainty  of  the  empiricaa  result  amounts  to  a  few 
seconds  only. 
(b)  DEFLECTION  OF  LIGHT  BY  A  GRAVITATIONAL 
FIELD 
In  Section  XXII  it  has  been  already  mentioned  that, 
1  Especially  since  the  next  planet  Venus  has  an  orbit  that  is 
almost  an  exact  circle,  which  makes  it  more  difficult  to  locate 
the  perihelion  with  precision.
