CHAPTER 18
TEMPERATURE, HEAT, AND THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

Figure 18-26 shows
three different arrange-
ments of materials 1, 2, and
3 to form a wall. The ther-
mal conductivities are k1 4
k2 4 k3.The left side of the
wall is 20 C- higher than
the right side. Rank the arrangements according to (a) the (steady
state) rate of energy conduction through the wall and (b) the tem-
perature difference across material 1,greatest first.

Figure 18-27 shows
two closed cycles on 
p-V diagrams for a gas.
The three parts of cycle 1
are of the same length
and shape as those of cy-
cle 2. For each cycle,
should the cycle be tra-
versed clockwise or coun-
terclockwise if (a) the net
work W done by the gas is to be positive and (b) the net energy
transferred by the gas as heat Q is to be positive?
8
For which cycle in Fig. 18-27, traversed clockwise, is (a) W
greater and (b) Q greater?
9
Three different materials of
identical mass are placed one at a
time in a special freezer that can ex-
tract energy from a material at a
certain constant rate. During the
cooling process, each material begins
in the liquid state and ends in the
solid state; Fig. 18-28 shows the tem-
perature T versus time t. (a) For ma-
terial 1,is the specific heat for the liquid state greater than or less than
that for the solid state? Rank the materials according to (b) freezing-
point temperature, (c) specific heat in the liquid state, (d) specific
heat in the solid state,and (e) heat of fusion,all greatest first.
10
A solid cube of edge length r, a solid sphere of radius r, and a
solid hemisphere of radius r, all made of the same material, are
maintained at temperature 300 K in an environment at tempera-
ture 350 K.Rank the objects according to the net rate at which ther-
mal radiation is exchanged with the environment,greatest first.
11
A hot object is dropped into a thermally insulated container of
water, and the object and water are then allowed to come to thermal
equilibrium. The experiment is repeated twice, with different hot ob-
jects. All three objects have the same mass and initial temperature,
and the mass and initial temperature of the water are the same in the
three experiments.For each of the experiments,Fig.18-29 gives graphs
of the temperatures T of the object and the water versus time t. Rank
the graphs according to the specific heats of the objects, greatest first.
2
Figure 18-24 shows three linear
temperature scales, with the freezing
and boiling points of water indicated.
Rank the three scales according to
the size of one degree on them, great-
est first.
3
Materials A, B, and C are solids
that are at their melting tempera-
tures. Material A requires 200 J to melt 4 kg, material B requires
300 J to melt 5 kg, and material C requires 300 J to melt 6 kg. Rank
the materials according to their heats of fusion, greatest first.
4
A sample A of liquid water and a sample B of ice, of identical
mass, are placed in a thermally insulated container and allowed to
come to thermal equilibrium.Figure 18-25a is a sketch of the tempera-
ture T of the samples versus time t.(a) Is the equilibrium temperature
above, below, or at the freezing point of water? (b) In reaching equi-
librium,does the liquid partly freeze,fully freeze,or undergo no freez-
ing? (c) Does the ice partly melt,fully melt,or undergo no melting?
5
Question 4 continued: Graphs b through f of Fig. 18-25 are
additional sketches of T versus t, of which one or more are im-
possible to produce. (a) Which is impossible and why? (b) In the
possible ones, is the equilibrium temperature above, below, or at
the freezing point of water? (c) As the possible situations reach
equilibrium, does the liquid partly freeze, fully freeze, or un-
dergo no freezing? Does the ice partly melt, fully melt, or un-
dergo no melting?
