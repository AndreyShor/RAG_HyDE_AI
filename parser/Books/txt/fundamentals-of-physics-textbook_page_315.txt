In Fig. 10-37, two particles,
each with mass m
0.85 kg, are fas-
tened to each other, and to a rotation
axis at O, by two thin rods, each with
length d ! 5.6 cm and mass M !
1.2

around the rotation axis with the an-
gular speed v ! 0.30 rad/s. Measured
about O, what are the combination’s

The masses and coordinates of four particles are as 
follows: 50 g, x ! 2.0 cm, y ! 2.0 cm; 25 g, x ! 0, y ! 4.0 cm; 25 g,
x ! %3.0 cm, y ! %3.0 cm; 30 g, x ! %2.0 cm, y ! 4.0 cm. What
are the rotational inertias of this collection about the (a) x, (b) y,
and (c) z axes? (d) Suppose that we symbolize the answers to (a)
and (b) as A and B, respectively. Then what is the answer to (c)
in terms of A and B?

light passes through one of the slots at the outside edge of the
wheel, travels to a distant mirror, and returns to the wheel just in
time to pass through the next slot in the wheel. One such slotted
wheel has a radius of 5.0 cm and 500 slots around its edge.
Measurements taken when the mirror is L ! 500 m from the
wheel indicate a speed of light of 3.0 $ 105 km/s. (a) What is the
(constant) angular speed of the wheel? (b) What is the linear
speed of a point on the edge of the wheel?

A gyroscope flywheel of radius 2.83 cm is accelerated from
rest at 14.2 rad/s2 until its angular speed is 2760 rev/min. (a) What is
the tangential acceleration of a point on the rim of the flywheel during
this spin-up process? (b) What is the radial acceleration of this point
when the flywheel is spinning at full speed? (c) Through what distance
does a point on the rim move during the spin-up?

A disk, with a radius of 0.25 m, is to be rotated like a merry-
go-round through 800 rad, starting from rest, gaining angular speed
at the constant rate a1 through the first 400 rad and then losing an-
gular speed at the constant rate %a1 until it is again at rest.The mag-
nitude of the centripetal acceleration of any portion of the disk is
not to exceed 400 m/s2. (a) What is the least time required for the ro-
tation? (b) What is the corresponding value of a1?

A car starts from rest and moves around a circular track of 
radius 30.0 m. Its speed increases at the constant rate of 0.500 m/s2.

(b) What angle does this net acceleration vector make with the
car’s velocity at this time?

glued to a rod of length L ! 6.00 cm

can rotate around a perpendicular
axis through point O at the left end.

axis decrease when that removed particle is (a) the innermost one
and (b) the outermost one?

cylinder with a mass of 500 kg and a radius of 1.0 m. (a) What is the

arrangement can rotate about a perpendicular axis through its cen-
tral disk at point O. (a) What is the rotational inertia of the
arrangement about that axis? (b) If we approximated the arrange-
ment as being a uniform rod of mass M and length L, what percent-
age error would we make in using the formula in Table 10-2e to cal-
culate the rotational inertia?
