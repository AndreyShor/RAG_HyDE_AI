process interference. If the combining waves originate in a single wavefront—as in
a single-slit experiment—we call the process diffraction. This distinction between
interference and diffraction (which is somewhat arbitrary and not always adhered
to) is a convenient one, but we should not forget that both are superposition
effects and usually both are present simultaneously (as in Fig.36-16a).

envelope.The bright fringes to one side of the central bright
fringe are shown in Fig. 36-17.
(b) How many bright fringes are within either of the first
side peaks of the diffraction envelope?
KEY IDEA
The outer limits of the first side diffraction peaks are the
second diffraction minima, each of which is at the angle u
given by a sin u ! m1l with m1 ! 2:
a sin u ! 2l.
(36-24)
Calculation: Dividing Eq. 36-23 by Eq. 36-24, we find
This tells us that the second diffraction minimum occurs just
before the bright interference fringe for m2 ! 10 in Eq. 36-23.
Within either first side diffraction peak we have the fringes
from m2 ! 5 to m2 ! 9, for a total of five bright fringes of
the double-slit interference pattern (shown in the inset of
Fig. 36-17). However, if the m2 ! 5 bright fringe, which is al-
most eliminated by the first diffraction minimum, is consid-
ered too dim to count, then only four bright fringes are in
the first side diffraction peak.

Sample Problem 36.05
Double-slit experiment with diffraction of each slit included
In a double-slit experiment, the wavelength l of the light
source is 405 nm, the slit separation d is 19.44 mm, and the
slit width a is 4.050 mm. Consider the interference of the
light from the two slits and also the diffraction of the light
through each slit.
(a) How many bright interference fringes are within the
central peak of the diffraction envelope?
KEY IDEAS
We first analyze the two basic mechanisms responsible for
the optical pattern produced in the experiment:
1. Single-slit diffraction: The limits of the central peak are
the first minima in the diffraction pattern due to either slit
individually. (See Fig. 36-15.) The angular locations of
those minima are given by Eq. 36-3 (a sin u ! ml). Here
let us rewrite this equation as a sin u ! m1l, with the
subscript 1 referring to the one-slit diffraction. For the first
minima in the diffraction pattern, we substitute m1 ! 1,
obtaining
a sin u ! l.
(36-22)
2. Double-slit interference: The angular locations of the
bright fringes of the double-slit interference pattern are
given by Eq. 35-14, which we can write as
d sin u ! m2l,
for m2 ! 0, 1, 2, . . . .
(36-23)
Here the subscript 2 refers to the double-slit interference.
Calculations: We can locate the first diffraction minimum
within the double-slit fringe pattern by dividing Eq. 36-23 by
Eq. 36-22 and solving for m2. By doing so and then substitut-
ing the given data, we obtain
This tells us that the bright interference fringe for m2 ! 4
fits into the central peak of the one-slit diffraction pattern,
but the fringe for m2 ! 5 does not fit.Within the central dif-
fraction peak we have the central bright fringe (m2 ! 0),
and four bright fringes (up to m2 ! 4) on each side of it.
Thus, a total of nine bright fringes of the double-slit interfer-
ence pattern are within the central peak of the diffraction
