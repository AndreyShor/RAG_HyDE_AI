Figure 24-24 shows eight parti-
cles that form a square, with dis-
tance d between adjacent particles.
What is the net electric potential at
point P at the center of the square
if we take the electric potential to
be zero at infinity?

Figure 24-25 shows three sets of
cross sections of equipotential sur-
faces in uniform electric fields; all
three cover the same size region of
space. The electric potential is indi-

Equipotential Surfaces
The points on an equipotential sur-
face all have the same electric potential. The work done on a test
charge in moving it from one such surface to another is independent
of the locations of the initial and final points on these surfaces and of
the path that joins the points.The electric field 
is always directed
perpendicularly to corresponding equipotential surfaces.
Finding V from
The electric potential difference between
two points i and f is
(24-18)
where the integral is taken over any path connecting the points. If the
integration is difficult along any particular path,we can choose a differ-
ent path along which the integration might be easier.If we choose Vi $
0,we have,for the potential at a particular point,

In the special case of a uniform field of magnitude E, the po-
tential change between two adjacent (parallel) equipotential lines
separated by distance !x is

Potential Due to a Charged Particle
The electric potential
due to a single charged particle at a distance r from that particle is

where V has the same sign as q.The potential due to a collection of
charged particles is

Potential Due to a Continuous Charge Distribution
For a continuous distribution of charge, Eq. 24-27 becomes
(24-32)
in which the integral is taken over the entire distribution.
Calculating 
from V
The component of 
in any direction
is the negative of the rate at which the potential changes with dis-
tance in that direction:

When 
is uniform, Eq. 24-40 reduces to
(24-42)
where s is perpendicular to the equipotential surfaces.
Electric Potential Energy of a System of Charged
Particles
The electric potential energy of a system of charged
particles is equal to the work needed to assemble the system with
the particles initially at rest and infinitely distant from each other.
For two particles at separation r,

Potential of a Charged Conductor
An excess charge placed
on a conductor will, in the equilibrium state, be located entirely on
the outer surface of the conductor.The charge will distribute itself so
that the following occur: (1) The entire conductor, including interior
points, is at a uniform potential. (2) At every internal point, the elec-
tric field due to the charge cancels the external electric field that oth-
erwise would have been there. (3) The net electric field at every
point on the surface is perpendicular to the surface.
