GAUSSIAN  CO-ORDINATES 
ACCORDING  to  Gauss,  this  combined  analytical 
and  geometrical  mode  of  handling  the  problem 
can  be  arrived  at  in  the  following  way.  We 
imagine  a  system  of  arbitrary  curves  (see  Fig.  4) 
drawn  on  the  surface  of  the  table.  These  we  desig 
nate  as  w-curves,  and  we  indicate  each  of  them  by 
means  of  a  number.  The  curves  «=i,  u=2  and 
w=3  are  drawn  in  the  diagram.  Between  the  curves 
w=i  and  «=2  we  must  imagine  an  infinitely  large 
number  to  be  drawn,  all  of  which  correspond  to  real 
numbers  lying  between  I  and  2.  We  have  then 
a  system  of  w-curves,  and 
this  "infinitely  dense"  sys 
tem  covers  the  whole  sur 
face  of  the  table.  These 
w-curves  must  not  intersect 
each  other,  and  through  each 
point  of  the  surface  one  and 
only  one  curve  must  pass. 
Thus  a  perfectly  definite 
value  of  u  belongs  to  every  point  on  the  surface  of  the 
marble  slab.  In  like  manner  we  imagine  a  system  of 
w-curves  drawn  on  the  surface.  These  satisfy  the  same 
conditions  as  the  w-curves,  they  are  provided  with  num-
