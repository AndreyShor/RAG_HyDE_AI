82     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
disc,  on  dividing  the  one  by  the  other,  he  will  not  obtain 
as  quotient  the  familiar  number  77=3-14  .  .  .,  but 
a  larger  number,1  whereas  of  course,  for  a  disc  which  is 
at  rest  with  respect  to  K,  this  operation  would  yield  IT 
exactly.  This  proves  that  the  propositions  of  Euclidean 
geometry  cannot  hold  exactly  on  the  rotating  disc,  nor 
in  general  in  a  gravitational  field,  at  least  if  we  attribute 
the  length  i  to  the  rod  in  all  positions  and  in  every 
orientation.  Hence  the  idea  of  a  straight  line  also  loses 
its  meaning.  We  are  therefore  not  in  a  position  to 
define  exactly  the  co-ordinates  x,  y,  z  relative  to  the 
disc  by  means  of  the  method  used  in  discussing  the 
special  theory,  and  as  long  as  the  co-ordinates  and  times 
of  events  have  not  been  defined,  we  cannot  assign  an 
exact  meaning  to  the  natural  laws  in  which  these  occur. 
Thus  all  our  previous  conclusions  based  on  general 
relativity  would  appear  to  be  called  in  question.  In 
reality  we  must  make  a  subtle  detour  in  order  to  be 
able  to  apply  the  postulate  of  general  relativity  ex 
actly.  I  shall  prepare  the  reader  for  this  in  the 
following  paragraphs. 
1  Throughout  this  consideration  we  have  to  use  the  Galileian 
(non-rotating)  system  K  as  reference-body,  since  we  may  only 
assume  the  validity  of  the  results  of  the  special  theory  of  rela 
tivity  relative  to  K  (relative  to  K'  a  gravitational  field  prevails).
