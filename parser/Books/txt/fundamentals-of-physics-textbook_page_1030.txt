In Fig.33-51,light is incident
at angle u1
40.1 on a boundary be-
tween two transparent materials.
Some of the light travels down
through the next three layers of
transparent materials, while some of
it reflects upward and then escapes
into the air. If n1 ! 1.30, n2 ! 1.40,
n3 ! 1.32, and n4 ! 1.45, what is the
value of (a) u5 in the air and (b) u4 in
the bottom material?

In Fig. 33-52a, a beam of light
in material 1 is incident on a bound-
ary at an angle of u1 = 30°.The extent of refraction of the light into
material 2 depends, in part, on the index of refraction n2 of material
2. Figure 33-52b gives the angle of refraction u2 versus n2 for a
range of possible n2 values. The vertical axis scale is set by 
u2a ! 20.0° and u2b ! 40.0°. (a) What is the index of refraction of

When the rectangular metal
tank in Fig. 33-46 is filled to the top
with an unknown liquid, observer
O, with eyes level with the top of
the tank, can just see corner E. A
ray that refracts toward O at the top
surface of the liquid is shown. If
D ! 85.0 cm and L ! 1.10 m, what
is the index of refraction of the
liquid?

In Fig. 33-47a, a light ray in
an underlying material is incident
at angle u1 on a boundary with water, and some of the light
refracts into the water. There are two choices of underlying ma-
terial. For each, the angle of refraction u2 versus the incident
angle u1 is given in Fig. 33-47b. The horizontal axis scale is set by
u1s ! 90°. Without calculation, determine whether the index of
refraction of (a) material 1 and (b) material 2 is greater or less
than the index of water (n ! 1.33). What is the index of refrac-
tion of (c) material 1 and (d) material 2?

Figure 33-49 shows light re-
flecting from two perpendicular
reflecting surfaces A and B. Find the

and the outgoing ray r#.

In Fig. 33-50a, a beam of light
in material 1 is incident on a bound-
ary at an angle u1 ! 40°. Some of the
light travels through material 2, and then some of it emerges into
material 3. The two boundaries between the three materials are
parallel. The final direction of the beam depends, in part, on the
index of refraction n3 of the third material. Figure 33-50b gives
the angle of refraction u3 in that material versus n3 for a range of
possible n3 values. The vertical axis scale is set by u3a ! 30.0° and
u3b ! 50.0°. (a) What is the index of refraction of material 1, or is
the index impossible to calculate without more information?
(b) What is the index of refraction of material 2, or is the index im-
possible to calculate without more information? (c) If u1 is changed
to 70° and the index of refraction of material 3 is 2.4,what is u3?

Light in vacuum is incident on the surface of a glass slab. In
the vacuum the beam makes an angle of 32.0° with the normal to
the surface, while in the glass it makes an angle of 21.0° with the
normal.What is the index of refraction of the glass?

In Fig. 33-48a, a light ray in water is incident at angle u1 on a
boundary with an underlying material, into which some of the
light refracts. There are two choices of underlying material. For
each, the angle of refraction u2 versus the incident angle u1 is
given in Fig. 33-48b. The vertical axis scale is set by u2s ! 90°.
Without calculation, determine whether the index of refraction of
(a) material 1 and (b) material 2 is greater or less than the index
of water (n ! 1.33).What is the index of refraction of (c) material
1 and (d) material 2?
