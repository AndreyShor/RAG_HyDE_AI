constant pressure.The gas molecules rotate but do not oscillate. By

Adiabatic wind. The normal airflow over the
Rocky Mountains is west to east.The air loses much of its moisture
content and is chilled as it climbs the western side of the moun-
tains.When it descends on the eastern side, the increase in pressure
toward lower altitudes causes the temperature to increase. The
flow, then called a chinook wind, can rapidly raise the air tempera-
ture at the base of the mountains. Assume that the air pressure p
depends on altitude y according to p

A gas is to be expanded from initial state i to final state f
along either path 1 or path 2 on a p-V diagram. Path 1 consists of
three steps: an isothermal expansion (work is 40 J in magnitude),
an adiabatic expansion (work is 20 J in magnitude), and another
isothermal expansion (work is 30 J in magnitude). Path 2 consists
of two steps: a pressure reduction at constant volume and an ex-
pansion at constant pressure.What is the change in the internal en-
ergy of the gas along path 2?

Figure 19-26 shows two paths that may be taken by a gas
from an initial point i to a final point f. Path 1 consists of an isother-
mal expansion (work is 50 J in magnitude), an adiabatic expansion
(work is 40 J in magnitude), an isothermal compression (work is
30 J in magnitude), and then an adiabatic compression (work is 25 J
in magnitude). What is the change in the internal energy of the gas
if the gas goes from point i to point f along path 2?
