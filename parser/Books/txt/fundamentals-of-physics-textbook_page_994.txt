The magnitude of the electric field
between the two circular parallel plates in
Fig. 32-33 is E ! (4.0 & 105) ' (6.0 & 104t),
with E in volts per meter and t in seconds.
At t ! 0,
is upward.The plate area is 4.0 &
10'2 m2. For t 4 0, what are the (a) magni-
tude and (b) direction (up or down) of the
displacement current between the plates
and (c) is the direction of the induced magnetic field clockwise or
counterclockwise in the figure?
••25
As a parallel-plate capacitor with circular plates 20 cm
in diameter is being charged, the current density of the displace-
ment current in the region between the plates is uniform and has a
magnitude of 20 A/m2. (a) Calculate the magnitude B of the mag-
netic field at a distance r ! 50 mm from the axis of symmetry of
this region. (b) Calculate dE/dt in this region.
••26
A capacitor with parallel circular plates of radius R ! 1.20
cm is discharging via a current of 12.0 A. Consider a loop of radius
R/3 that is centered on the central axis between the plates. (a) How
much displacement current is encircled by the loop? The maximum
induced magnetic field has a magnitude of 12.0 mT.At what radius
(b) inside and (c) outside the capacitor gap is the magnitude of the
induced magnetic field 3.00 mT?
••27
In Fig. 32-34, a uniform
electric field 
collapses. The verti-
cal axis scale is set by Es ! 6.0 & 105
N/C, and the horizontal axis scale is
set by ts ! 12.0 ms. Calculate the
magnitude of the displacement cur-
rent through a 1.6 m2 area perpen-
dicular to the field during each of
the time intervals a, b, and c shown
on the graph. (Ignore the behavior
at the ends of the intervals.)
••28
Figure 32-35a shows the
current i that is produced in a wire
of resistivity 1.62 & 10'8 "(m. The
magnitude of the current versus
time t is shown in Fig. 32-35b. The
vertical axis scale is set by is ! 10.0
A, and the horizontal axis scale is
set by ts ! 50.0 ms. Point P is at
radial distance 9.00 mm from the
wire’s center. Determine the mag-
nitude of the magnetic field 
at
point P due to the actual current i
in the wire at (a) t ! 20 ms, (b) t !
40 ms, and (c) t ! 60 ms. Next, as-
sume that the electric field driving
the current is confined to the wire.
Then determine the magnitude of
the magnetic field 
at point P
due to the displacement current id
in the wire at (d) t ! 20 ms, (e) t !
40 ms, and (f) t ! 60 ms. At point
P at t ! 20 s, what is the direction
(into or out of the page) of (g) 
and (h)

A silver wire has resistivity r ! 1.62 & 10'8 "(m and
a cross-sectional area of 5.00 mm2. The current in the wire is uni-
form and changing at the rate of 2000 A/s when the current is
100 A. (a) What is the magnitude of the (uniform) electric field in
the wire when the current in the wire is 100 A? (b) What is the
displacement current in the wire at that time? (c) What is the ratio
of the magnitude of the magnetic field due to the displacement
current to that due to the current at a distance r from the wire?
••18
The circuit in Fig. 32-31 consists
of switch S, a 12.0 V ideal battery, a
20.0 M" resistor, and an air-filled capa-
citor. The capacitor has parallel circular
plates of radius 5.00 cm, separated by
3.00 mm. At time t ! 0, switch S is
closed to begin charging the capacitor.

uniform. At t ! 250 ms, what is the magnitude of the magnetic
field within the capacitor, at radial distance 3.00 cm?

circular region of radius R ! 3.00 cm in which a displacement cur-
rent is directed out of the page. The displacement current has a
uniform density of magnitude Jd ! 6.00 A/m2. What is the magni-
tude of the magnetic field due to the displacement current at radial
distances (a) 2.00 cm and (b) 5.00 cm?

region of radius R ! 3.00 cm in which a uniform displacement cur-
rent id ! 0.500 A is out of the page. What is the magnitude of the
magnetic field due to the displacement current at radial distances
(a) 2.00 cm and (b) 5.00 cm?

shows a circular region of radius R
3.00 cm in which a displace-
ment current is directed out of the page.The magnitude of the den-
sity of this displacement current is Jd ! (4.00 A/m2)(1 ' r/R),
where r is the radial distance (r 3 R).What is the magnitude of the
magnetic field due to the displacement current at (a) r ! 2.00 cm
and (b) r ! 5.00 cm?
••22
Nonuniform displacement current. Figure 32-30 shows a
circular region of radius R
3.00 cm in which a displacement
current id is directed out of the figure. The magnitude of the 
displacement current is id ! (3.00 A)(r/R),
where r is the radial distance (r 3 R) from the
center. What is the magnitude of the mag-
netic field due to id at radial distances (a)
2.00 cm and (b) 5.00 cm?

In Fig. 32-32, a parallel-plate
capacitor has square plates of edge length
L
1.0 m.A current of 2.0 A charges the ca-
pacitor, producing a uniform electric field 
between the plates, with

the plates. (a) What is the displacement cur-
rent id through the region between the
plates? (b) What is dE/dt in this region?

cled by the square dashed path of edge
