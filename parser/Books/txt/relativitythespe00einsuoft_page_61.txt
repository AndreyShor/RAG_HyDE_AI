HEURISTIC  VALUE  OF  RELATIVITY     43 
.  In  this  connection  the  relation  between  the 
>rdinary  and  the  accented  magnitudes  is  given  by  the 
Lorentz  transformation.  Or,  in  brief  :  General  laws 
>f  nature  are  co-variant  with  respect  to  Lorentz  trans- 
ormations. 
This  is  a  definite  mathematical  condition  that  the 
heory  of  relativity  demands  of  a  natural  law,  and  in 
virtue  of  this,  the  theory  becomes  a  valuable  heuristic  aid 
n  the  search  for  general  laws  of  nature.  If  a  general 
aw  of  nature  were  to  be  found  which  did  not  satisfy 
his  condition,  then  at  least  one  of  the  two  fundamental 
assumptions  of  the  theory  would  have  been  disproved, 
-et  us  now  examine  what  general  results  the  latter 
heory  has  hitherto  evinced.
