Figure 27-34 shows five 5.00 0
resistors. Find the equivalent resis-
tance between points (a) F and H and
(b) F and G. (Hint: For each pair of
points, imagine that a battery is con-

sistor 1, (b) the current in resistor 2,

Nine copper wires of length
l and diameter d are connected in par-
allel to form a single composite con-
ductor of resistance R. What must be
the diameter D of a single copper wire
of length l if it is to have the same re-
sistance?

Figure 27-37 shows a battery
connected across a uniform resistor
R0. A sliding contact can move across
the resistor from x ! 0 at the left to 
x ! 10 cm at the right. Moving
the contact changes how much resist-
ance is to the left of the contact and
how much is to the right. Find the
rate at which energy is dissipated in
resistor R as a function of x. Plot the
function for # ! 50 V, R ! 2000 0,
and R0 ! 100 0.

Side flash. Figure 27-38
indicates one reason no one should
stand under a tree during a lightning
storm. If lightning comes down the
side of the tree, a portion can jump
over to the person, especially if the
current on the tree reaches a dry re-
gion on the bark and thereafter must
travel through air to reach the
ground. In the figure, part of the lightning jumps through distance
d in air and then travels through the person (who has negligible
resistance relative to that of air because of the highly conducting
salty fluids within the body).The rest of the current travels through
air alongside the tree, for a distance h. If d/h ! 0.400 and the total
current is I ! 5000 A, what is the current through the person?

The ideal battery in Fig. 27-39a has emf # ! 6.0 V. Plot 1 in
Fig. 27-39b gives the electric potential difference V that can appear
across resistor 1 versus the current i in that resistor when the resistor
SSM
a conducting path of resistance R
connects the wires (Fig. 27-31). The
resistance of the wires and the short
is then 100 0 when measured from
the east end and 200 0 when meas-
ured from the west end. What are
(a) x and (b) R?

In Fig. 27-32a, both batteries have emf # ! 1.20 V and the
external resistance R is a variable resistor. Figure 27-32b gives the
electric potentials V between the terminals of each battery as func-
tions of R: Curve 1 corresponds to battery 1, and curve 2 corre-
sponds to battery 2.The horizontal scale is set by Rs ! 0.20 0.What
is the internal resistance of (a) battery 1 and (b) battery 2?
