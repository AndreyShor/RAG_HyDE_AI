(b) with an upward acceleration of
1.30 m/s2? (Hint: A free-body dia-
gram can really help.) If the rope
on the right extends to the ground
and is pulled by a co-worker, with
what force magnitude must the co-
worker pull for the man to rise (c)
with a constant velocity and (d)
with an upward acceleration of
1.30 m/s2? What is the magnitude
of the force on the ceiling from the
pulley system in (e) part a, (f ) part
b, (g) part c, and (h) part d?

A 10 kg monkey climbs
up a massless rope that runs over a
frictionless tree limb and back
down to a 15 kg package on the
ground (Fig. 5-54). (a) What is the
magnitude of the least acceleration
the monkey must have if it is to lift
the package off the ground? If, after
the package has been lifted, the
monkey stops its climb and holds
onto the rope, what are the (b)
magnitude and (c) direction of the
monkey’s acceleration and (d) the
tension in the rope?

Figure 5-45 shows a 5.00 kg
block being pulled along a friction-
less floor by a cord that applies a
force of constant magnitude 20.0 N
but with an angle u(t) that varies
with time.When angle u " 25.03, at
what rate is the acceleration of the
block 
changing 
if 
(a) 
u(t) " 
(2.00 ' 10$2 deg/s)t and (b) u(t) " $(2.00 ' 10$2 deg/s)t? (Hint:
The angle should be in radians.)

A hot-air balloon of mass M is descending vertically
with downward acceleration of magnitude a.How much mass (ballast)
must be thrown out to give the balloon an upward acceleration of mag-
nitude a? Assume that the upward force from the air (the lift) does not
change because of the decrease in mass.

at an angle that is smaller than the theoretical one (about 423) at
which the distance of a projected ball at the same speed and
height is greatest. One reason has to do with the speed the athlete
can give the shot during the acceleration phase of the throw.
Assume that a 7.260 kg shot is accelerated along a straight path of
length 1.650 m by a constant applied force of magnitude 380.0 N,
starting with an initial speed of 2.500 m/s (due to the athlete’s pre-
liminary motion). What is the shot’s speed at the end of the accel-
eration phase if the angle between the path and the horizontal is
(a) 30.003 and (b) 42.003? (Hint: Treat the motion as though it
were along a ramp at the given angle.) (c) By what percent is the
launch speed decreased if the athlete increases the angle from
30.003 to 42.003?

Figure 5-47 shows Atwood’s machine, in which two con-
tainers are connected by a cord (of negligible mass) passing over a
frictionless pulley (also of negligible mass).At time t " 0, container
1 has mass 1.30 kg and container 2 has mass 2.80 kg, but container 1
is losing mass (through a leak) at the constant rate of 0.200 kg/s. At
what rate is the acceleration magnitude of the containers changing
at (a) t " 0 and (b) t " 3.00 s? (c) When does the acceleration reach
its maximum value?

connecting cord? (b) What is the largest value the magnitude of
