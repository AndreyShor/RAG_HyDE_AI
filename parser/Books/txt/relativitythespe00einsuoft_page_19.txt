RELATIVITY 
PART   I 
THE  SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
PHYSICAL  MEANING  OF  GEOMETRICAL 
PROPOSITIONS 
IN  
your  schooldays  most  of  you  who  read  this 
book  made  acquaintance  with  the  noble  building  of 
Euclid's  geometry,  and  you  remember — perhaps 
with  more  respect  than  love — the  magnificent  structure, 
on  the  lofty  staircase  of  which  you  were  chased  about 
for  uncounted  hours  by  conscientious  teachers.  By
