Equation 38-24 is the time-independent solution of Schrödinger’s equation.
We can assume it is the spatial part of the wave function at some initial time t ! 0.
Given values for E and U, we could determine the coefficients A and B to see
how the wave function looks at t ! 0. Then, if we wanted to see how the wave
function evolves with time, we follow the guide of Eq. 38-18 and multiply 
Eq. 38-24 by the time dependence e#ivt:
&(x, t) ! c (x)e#ivt ! (Aeikx ' Be#ikx)e#ivt
! Aei(kx#vt) ' Be#i(kx'vt).
(38-25)
Here, however, we will not go that far.
Finding the Probability Density |c|2
In Module 16-1 we saw that any function F of the form F(kx ( vt) represents a
traveling wave. In Chapter 16, the functions were sinusoidal (sines and cosines);
here they are exponentials. If we wanted, we could always switch between the
two forms by using the Euler formula: For a general argument u,
eiu ! cos u ' i sin u
and
e–iu ! cosu # i sin u.
(38-26)
The first term on the right in Eq. 38-25 represents a wave traveling in the posi-
tive direction of x, and the second term represents a wave traveling in the negative
direction of x.Let’s evaluate the probability density |c 2| for a particle with only posi-
tive motion. We eliminate the negative motion by setting B to zero, and then the 
solution at t ! 0 becomes
c (x) ! Aeikx.
(38-27)
To calculate the probability density, we take the square of the absolute value:
|c |2 ! |Aeikx|2 ! A2|eikx|2.
Because
|eikx|2 ! (eikx)(eikx)* ! eikxe#ikx ! eikx#ikx ! e0 ! 1,
we get
|c |2 ! A2(1)2! A2.
Now here is the point: For the condition we have set up (uniform potential en-
ergy U, including U ! 0 for a free particle), the probability density is a constant
(the same value A2) for any point along the x axis, as shown in the plot of Fig.
38-13.That means that if we make a measurement to locate the particle, the loca-
tion could turn out to be at any x value. Thus, we cannot say that the particle is
moving along the axis in a classical way as a car moves along a street. In fact, the
particle does not have a location until we measure it.
