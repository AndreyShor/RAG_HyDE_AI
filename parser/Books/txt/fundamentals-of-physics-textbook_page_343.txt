11-9 PRECESSION OF A GYROSCOPE
Precession of a Gyroscope
A simple gyroscope consists of a wheel fixed to a shaft and free to spin about the
axis of the shaft. If one end of the shaft of a nonspinning gyroscope is placed on a
support as in Fig. 11-22a and the gyroscope is released, the gyroscope falls by rotat-
ing downward about the tip of the support. Since the fall involves rotation, it is gov-
erned by Newton’s second law in angular form,which is given by Eq.11-29:
(11-41)
This equation tells us that the torque causing the downward rotation (the fall)
changes the angular momentum 
of the gyroscope from its initial value of zero.
The torque 
is due to the gravitational force 
acting at the gyroscope’s center
of mass,which we take to be at the center of the wheel.The moment arm relative to
the support tip,located at O in Fig.11-22a,is .The magnitude of is
t ! Mgr sin 90( ! Mgr
(11-42)
(because the angle between 
and 
is 90(), and its direction is as shown in
Fig. 11-22a.
A rapidly spinning gyroscope behaves differently. Assume it is released with
the shaft angled slightly upward. It first rotates slightly downward but then, while
it is still spinning about its shaft, it begins to rotate horizontally about a vertical
axis through support point O in a motion called precession.
Why Not Just Fall Over? Why does the spinning gyroscope stay aloft instead
of falling over like the nonspinning gyroscope? The clue is that when the spinning
gyroscope is released, the torque due to 
must change not an initial angular mo-
mentum of zero but rather some already existing nonzero angular momentum due
to the spin.
To see how this nonzero initial angular momentum leads to precession, we first
consider the angular momentum 
of the gyroscope due to its spin.To simplify the
situation,we assume the spin rate is so rapid that the angular momentum due to pre-
cession is negligible relative to .We also assume the shaft is horizontal when pre-
cession begins,as in Fig.11-22b.The magnitude of 
is given by Eq.11-31:
L ! Iv,
(11-43)
where I is the rotational moment of the gyroscope about its shaft and v is the an-
gular speed at which the wheel spins about the shaft. The vector 
points along
the shaft, as in Fig. 11-22b. Since 
is parallel to 
torque 
must be
perpendicular to .

11-9 PRECESSION OF A GYROSCOPE
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
11.26 Identify that the gravitational force acting on a spinning
gyroscope causes the spin angular momentum vector (and
thus the gyroscope) to rotate about the vertical axis in a
motion called precession.
11.27 Calculate the precession rate of a gyroscope.
11.28 Identify that a gyroscope’s precession rate is 
independent of the gyroscope’s mass.
●A spinning gyroscope can precess about a vertical axis through its support at the rate
where M is the gyroscope’s mass, r is the moment arm, I is the rotational inertia, and v is the spin rate.
