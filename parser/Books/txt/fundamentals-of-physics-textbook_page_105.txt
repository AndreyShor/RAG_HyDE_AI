RELATIVE MOTION IN ONE DIMENSION
velocity vPB of P as measured by B plus the velocity vBA of B as measured by A.”
The term vBA is the velocity of frame B relative to frame A.
Here we consider only frames that move at constant velocity relative to
each other. In our example, this means that Barbara (frame B) drives always at
constant velocity vBA relative to Alex (frame A). Car P (the moving particle),
however, can change speed and direction (that is, it can accelerate).
To relate an acceleration of P as measured by Barbara and by Alex, we take
the time derivative of Eq. 4-41:
Because vBA is constant, the last term is zero and we have
aPA " aPB.

In other words,

dt  (vPB) # d
dt  (vBA).
Observers on different frames of reference that move at constant velocity relative
to each other will measure the same acceleration for a moving particle.
Sample Problem 4.07
Relative motion, one dimensional, Alex and Barbara
to relate the acceleration to the initial and final velocities
of P.
Calculation: The initial velocity of P relative to Alex is
vPA " $78 km/h and the final velocity is 0.Thus, the acceler-
ation relative to Alex is
(Answer)
(c) What is the acceleration aPB of car P relative to Barbara
during the braking?
KEY IDEA
To calculate the acceleration of car P relative to Barbara, we
must use the car’s velocities relative to Barbara.
Calculation: We know the initial velocity of P relative to
Barbara from part (a) (vPB " $130 km/h).The final veloc-
ity of P relative to Barbara is $52 km/h (because this is
the velocity of the stopped car relative to the moving
Barbara).Thus,
(Answer)
Comment: We should have foreseen this result: Because
Alex and Barbara have a constant relative velocity, they
must measure the same acceleration for the car.

In Fig. 4-18, suppose that Barbara’s velocity relative to Alex
is a constant vBA " 52 km/h and car P is moving in the nega-
tive direction of the x axis.
(a) If Alex measures a constant vPA " $78 km/h for car P,
what velocity vPB will Barbara measure?
KEY IDEAS
We can attach a frame of reference A to Alex and a frame of
reference B to Barbara. Because the frames move at constant
velocity relative to each other along one axis, we can use
Eq. 4-41 (vPA " vPB # vBA) to relate vPB to vPA and vBA.
Calculation: We find
$78 km/h " vPB # 52 km/h.
Thus,
vPB " $130 km/h.
(Answer)
Comment: If car P were connected to Barbara’s car by a
cord wound on a spool, the cord would be unwinding at
a speed of 130 km/h as the two cars separated.
(b) If car P brakes to a stop relative to Alex (and thus rela-
tive to the ground) in time t " 10 s at constant acceleration,
what is its acceleration aPA relative to Alex?
KEY IDEAS
To calculate the acceleration of car P relative to Alex, we
must use the car’s velocities relative to Alex. Because the
acceleration is constant, we can use Eq. 2-11 (v " v0 # at)
