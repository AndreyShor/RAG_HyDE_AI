43-1 NUCLEAR FISSION
there is not enough energy from a thermal neutron for the excited nucleus to sur-
mount the barrier or to tunnel through it effectively. Instead of fissioning, the nu-
cleus gets rid of its excitation energy by emitting a gamma-ray photon.
The nuclides 238U and 243Am can be made to fission, however, if they absorb
a substantially energetic (rather than a thermal) neutron. A 238U nucleus, for
example, might fission if it happens to absorb a neutron of at least 1.3 MeV in a
so-called fast fission process (“fast” because the neutron is fast).
The two atomic bombs used in World War II depended on the ability of
thermal neutrons to cause many high-mass nuclides in the cores of the bombs to
fission nearly all at once. The process is initiated by a neutron emitter such as
beryllium. After its emitted thermal neutrons cause the fission of the first set of
235U, each fission releases more thermal neutrons, which cause more 235U to fis-
sion and release thermal neutrons. This chain reaction would rapidly spread
through the 235U in the bomb, resulting in an explosive and devastating output of
energy. Researchers knew that 235U would work, but they had refined only
enough for one bomb from uranium ore, which consists mainly of 238U, which
thermal neutrons will not fission. As the first bomb was being deployed, a 239Pu
bomb was tested successfully in New Mexico (Fig. 43-4), so the next deployed
bomb contained 239Pu rather than 235U.

Figure 43-4 This image has transfixed the world since World War II. When Robert
Oppenheimer, the head of the scientific team that developed the atomic bomb,
witnessed the first atomic explosion, he quoted from a sacred Hindu text: “Now I am
become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
