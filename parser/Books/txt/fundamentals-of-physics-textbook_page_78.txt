The Vector Product
The vector product of

smaller of the two angles between the vectors because sin f and sin(360° $ f)
differ in algebraic sign.) Because of the notation,

is also known as the cross
product, and in speech it is “a cross b.”

Figure 3-19a shows how to determine the direction of 
"
'
with what is
known as a right-hand rule. Place the vectors 
and 
tail to tail without altering
their orientations, and imagine a line that is perpendicular to their plane where
they meet. Pretend to place your right hand around that line in such a way that
your fingers would sweep 
into 
through the smaller angle between them.Your
outstretched thumb points in the direction of .
The order of the vector multiplication is important. In Fig. 3-19b, we are
determining the direction of
, so the fingers are placed to sweep 
into 
through the smaller angle. The thumb ends up in the opposite direction
from previously, and so it must be that 
; that is,
.

In other words, the commutative law does not apply to a vector product.
In unit-vector notation, we write
'
" (ax # ay # az ) ' (bx # by # bz ),
(3-26)
which can be expanded according to the distributive law; that is, each component
of the first vector is to be crossed with each component of the second vector.The
cross products of unit vectors are given in Appendix E (see “Products of
Vectors”). For example, in the expansion of Eq. 3-26, we have
ax ' bx " axbx( ' ) " 0,
because the two unit vectors and are parallel and thus have a zero cross prod-
uct. Similarly, we have
ax ' by " axby( ' ) " axby .
In the last step we used Eq. 3-24 to evaluate the magnitude of '
as unity.
