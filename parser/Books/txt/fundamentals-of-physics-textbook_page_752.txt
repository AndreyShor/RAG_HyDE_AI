CHAPTER 25
CAPACITANCE
Checkpoint 3
A battery of potential V stores charge q on a combination of two identical capacitors.
What are the potential difference across and the charge on either capacitor if the ca-
pacitors are (a) in parallel and (b) in series?
parallel can be replaced with their equivalent capacitor.
Therefore, we should first check whether any of the capaci-
tors in Fig. 25-10a are in parallel or series.
Finding equivalent capacitance: Capacitors 1 and 3 are
connected one after the other, but are they in series? No.
The potential V that is applied to the capacitors produces
charge on the bottom plate of capacitor 3. That charge
causes charge to shift from the top plate of capacitor 3.
However, note that the shifting charge can move to the bot-
Sample Problem 25.02
Capacitors in parallel and in series
(a) Find the equivalent capacitance for the combination of
capacitances shown in Fig. 25-10a, across which potential
difference V is applied.Assume

C2 ! 5.30 mF,
and
C3 ! 4.50 mF.

Any capacitors connected in series can be replaced with
their equivalent capacitor, and any capacitors connected in

We first reduce the
circuit to a single
capacitor.
Next, we work
backwards to the
desired capacitor.
Series capacitors and
their equivalent have
the same q (“seri-q”).
Parallel capacitors and
their equivalent have
the same V (“par-V”).
Applying V = q/C yields
the potential difference.
Applying q = CV
yields the charge.
Applying q = CV
yields the charge.
The equivalent of
parallel capacitors
is larger.
The equivalent of
series capacitors
is smaller.
Figure 25-10 (a)–(d) Three capacitors are reduced to one equivalent capacitor. (e)–(i) Working backwards to get the charges.
We can easily extend this to any number n of capacitors as
(n capacitors in series).
(25-20)
Using Eq. 25-20 you can show that the equivalent capacitance of a series of
capacitances is always less than the least capacitance in the series.
