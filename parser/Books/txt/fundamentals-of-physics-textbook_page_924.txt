CHAPTER 30
INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE
•31
If 50.0 cm of copper wire (diameter ! 1.00 mm) is
formed into a circular loop and placed perpendicular to a uniform
magnetic field that is increasing at the constant rate of 10.0 mT/s, at
what rate is thermal energy generated in the loop?
•32
A loop antenna of area 2.00 cm2 and resistance 5.21 m1 is
perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field of magnitude 17.0 mT.
The field magnitude drops to zero in 2.96 ms. How much thermal
energy is produced in the loop by the change in field?
••33
Figure 30-54 shows a rod of
length L
10.0 cm that is forced to
move at constant speed v
5.00 m/s
along horizontal rails. The rod, rails,
and connecting strip at the right
form a conducting loop. The rod has
resistance 0.400 1; the rest of the
loop has negligible resistance. A cur-
rent
i ! 100 A through the long
straight wire at distance a ! 10.0 mm
from the loop sets up a (nonuniform)
magnetic field through the loop. Find
the (a) emf and (b) current induced
in the loop. (c) At what rate is thermal energy generated in the
rod? (d) What is the magnitude of the force that must be applied to
the rod to make it move at constant speed? (e) At what rate does
this force do work on the rod?

field 
that is directed into the page
and that exists only above line aa.
The loop is then dropped; during its
fall, it accelerates until it reaches a
certain terminal speed vt. Ignoring
air drag, find an expression for vt.
••35
The conducting rod shown in
Fig. 30-52 has length L and is being
pulled along horizontal, frictionless
conducting rails at a constant veloc-
ity . The rails are connected at one
end with a metal strip. A uniform
magnetic field 
, directed out of
the page, fills the region in which the rod moves. Assume that L !
10 cm, v ! 5.0 m/s, and B ! 1.2 T.What are the (a) magnitude and
(b) direction (up or down the page) of the emf induced in the rod?
What are the (c) size and (d) direction of the current in the con-
ducting loop? Assume that the resistance of the rod is 0.40 1 and
that the resistance of the rails and metal strip is negligibly small.
(e) At what rate is thermal energy being generated in the rod?
(f) What external force on the rod is needed to maintain ? (g) At
what rate does this force do work on the rod?

Induced Electric Fields
•36
Figure 30-56 shows two circu-
lar regions R1 and R2 with radii r1 !
20.0 cm and r2 ! 30.0 cm. In R1
there is a uniform magnetic field of
magnitude
B1 ! 50.0 mT directed
into the page, and in R2 there is a
uniform magnetic field of magni-
tude B2 ! 75.0 mT directed out of
the page (ignore fringing). Both
fields are decreasing at the rate of
8.50 mT/s.
Calculate 
for
(a) path 1, (b) path 2, and (c) path 3.
•37
A long solenoid has a diameter of 12.0 cm.When a
current i exists in its windings, a uniform magnetic field of magni-
tude B ! 30.0 mT is produced in its interior. By decreasing i, the
field is caused to decrease at the rate of 6.50 mT/s. Calculate the
magnitude of the induced electric field (a) 2.20 cm and (b) 8.20 cm
from the axis of the solenoid.
••38
A circular region in an xy
plane is penetrated by a uniform
magnetic field in the positive direc-
tion of the z axis. The field’s magni-
tude B (in teslas) increases with
time t (in seconds) according to B !
at, where a is a constant.The magni-
tude E of the electric field set up by
that increase in the magnetic field is
given by Fig. 30-57 versus radial dis-
tance r; the vertical axis scale is set by Es ! 300 mN/C, and the
horizontal axis scale is set by rs ! 4.00 cm. Find a.
••39
The magnetic field of a cylindrical magnet that has a
pole-face diameter of 3.3 cm can be varied sinusoidally between
29.6 T and 30.0 T at a frequency of 15 Hz. (The current in a wire
wrapped around a permanent magnet is varied to give this varia-
tion in the net field.) At a radial distance of 1.6 cm, what is the
amplitude of the electric field induced by the variation?

Induction and Energy Transfers

In Fig. 30-52, a metal rod is
forced to move with constant veloc-
ity 
along two parallel metal rails,
connected with a strip of metal at
one end. A magnetic field of magni-
tude B ! 0.350 T points out of the
page. (a) If the rails are separated
by L ! 25.0 cm and the speed of the
rod is 55.0 cm/s, what emf is gener-
ated? (b) If the rod has a resistance of 18.0 " and the rails and con-
nector have negligible resistance, what is the current in the rod?
(c) At what rate is energy being transferred to thermal energy?
•30
In Fig. 30-53a, a circular loop of wire is concentric with a sole-
noid and lies in a plane perpendicular to the solenoid’s central axis.
The loop has radius 6.00 cm. The solenoid has radius 2.00 cm, con-
sists of 8000 turns/m, and has a current isol varying with time t as
given in Fig. 30-53b, where the vertical axis scale is set by is ! 1.00
A and the horizontal axis scale is set by ts ! 2.0 s. Figure 30-53c
shows, as a function of time, the energy Eth that is transferred
to thermal energy of the loop; the vertical axis scale is set by Es !
100.0 nJ.What is the loop’s resistance?
