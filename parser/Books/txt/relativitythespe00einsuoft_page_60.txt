THE  HEURISTIC  VALUE  OF  THE  THEORY  OF 
RELATIVITY 
OUR  
train  of  thought  in  the  foregoing  pages  can  be 
epitomised  in  the  following  manner.  Experience 
has  led  to  the  conviction  that,  on  the  one  hand, 
the  principle  of  relativity  holds  true,  and  that  on  the 
other  hand  the  velocity  of  transmission  of  light  in  vacuo 
has  to  be  considered  equal  to  a  constant  c.  By  uniting 
these  two  postulates  we  obtained  the  law  of  transforma 
tion  for  the  rectangular  co-ordinates  x,  y,  z  and  the  time 
t  of  the  events  which  constitute  the  processes  of  nature. 
In  this  connection  we  did  not  obtain  the  Galilei  trans 
formation,  but,  differing  from  classical  mechanics, 
the  Lorentz  transformation. 
The  law  of  transmission  of  light,  the  acceptance  of 
which  is  justified  by  our  actual  knowledge,  played  an 
important  part  in  this  process  of  thought.  Once  in 
possession  of  the  Lorentz  transformation,  however, 
we  can  combine  this  with  the  principle  of  relativity, 
and  sum  up  the  theory  thus  : 
Every  general  law  of  nature  must  be  so  constituted 
that  it  is  transformed  into  a  law  of  exactly  the  same 
form  when,  instead  of  the  space-time  variables  x,  y,  z,  t 
of  the  original  co-ordinate  system  K,  we  introduce  new 
space-time  variables  x',  y',  z',  t'  of  a  co-ordinate  system
