Determining Potential Energy Values
Here we find equations that give the value of the two types of potential energy
discussed in this chapter: gravitational potential energy and elastic potential
energy. However, first we must find a general relation between a conservative
force and the associated potential energy.
Consider a particle-like object that is part of a system in which a conservative
force 
acts. When that force does work W on the object, the change %U in
the potential energy associated with the system is the negative of the work done.
We wrote this fact as Eq. 8-1 (%U ! $W). For the most general case, in which the
force may vary with position, we may write the work W as in Eq. 7-32:
(8-5)
This equation gives the work done by the force when the object moves from
point xi to point xf, changing the configuration of the system. (Because the
force is conservative, the work is the same for all paths between those two
points.)

Sample Problem 8.01
Equivalent paths for calculating work, slippery cheese
The main lesson of this sample problem is this: It is perfectly
all right to choose an easy path instead of a hard path.
Figure 8-5a shows a 2.0 kg block of slippery cheese that
slides along a frictionless track from point a to point b. The
cheese travels through a total distance of 2.0 m along the
track, and a net vertical distance of 0.80 m. How much work is
done on the cheese by the gravitational force during the slide?
KEY IDEAS
(1) We cannot calculate the work by using Eq. 7-12 (Wg !
mgd cos f). The reason is that the angle f between the 
directions of the gravitational force 
and the displacement
varies along the track in an unknown way. (Even if we did
know the shape of the track and could calculate f along it,
the calculation could be very difficult.) (2) Because 
is a
conservative force, we can find the work by choosing some
other path between a and bâ€”one that makes the calcula-
tion easy.
Calculations: Let us choose the dashed path in Fig. 8-5b; it
consists of two straight segments. Along the horizontal seg-
ment, the angle f is a constant 90(. Even though we do not
know the displacement along that horizontal segment,Eq.7-12
tells us that the work Wh done there is
Wh ! mgd cos 90( ! 0.
Along the vertical segment, the displacement d is 0.80 m
and, with 
and 
both downward, the angle f is a constant

The gravitational force is conservative.
Any choice of path between the points
gives the same amount of work.

the gravitational force is easier along the dashed path than along
the actual path taken by the cheese; the result is the same for
both paths.

The total work done on the cheese by
