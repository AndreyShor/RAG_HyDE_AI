Average Speed
The average speed savg of a particle during a
time interval -t depends on the total distance the particle moves in
that time interval:
(2-3)
Instantaneous Velocity
The instantaneous velocity (or sim-
ply velocity) v of a moving particle is
(2-4)
where -x and -t are defined by Eq. 2-2.The instantaneous velocity
(at a particular time) may be found as the slope (at that particular
time) of the graph of x versus t. Speed is the magnitude of instanta-
neous velocity.
Average Acceleration
Average acceleration is the ratio of a
change in velocity -v to the time interval -t in which the change occurs:
(2-7)
The algebraic sign indicates the direction of aavg.
Instantaneous Acceleration
Instantaneous acceleration (or
simply acceleration) a is the first time derivative of velocity v(t)

and the second time derivative of position x(t):
(2-8, 2-9)
On a graph of v versus t, the acceleration a at any time t is the slope
of the curve at the point that represents t.
Constant Acceleration
The five equations in Table 2-1
describe the motion of a particle with constant acceleration:
v " v0 # at,
(2-11)
(2-15)
(2-16)
(2-17)
(2-18)
These are not valid when the acceleration is not constant.
Free-Fall Acceleration
An important example of straight-
line motion with constant acceleration is that of an object rising or
falling freely near Earth’s surface.The constant acceleration equa-
tions describe this motion, but we make two changes in notation:
(1) we refer the motion to the vertical y axis with #y vertically up;
(2) we replace a with $g, where g is the magnitude of the free-fall
acceleration. Near Earth’s surface, g " 9.8 m/s2 (" 32 ft/s2).

negative, or 0 at (b) t " 1 s, (c) t " 2
s, and (d) t " 3 s? (e) How many
times does the particle go through
the point x " 0?

Figure 2-20 gives the velocity of
a particle moving along an axis.
Point 1 is at the highest point on the
curve; point 4 is at the lowest point;
and points 2 and 6 are at the same
height. What is the direction of
travel at (a) time t " 0 and (b) point
4? (c) At which of the six numbered
points does the particle reverse its
direction of travel? (d) Rank the six
points according to the magnitude
of the acceleration, greatest first.

At t " 0,a particle moving along an
x axis is at position x0 " $20 m. The
signs of the particle’s initial velocity v0
(at time t0) and constant acceleration a
are, respectively, for four situations: (1)
#, #; (2) #, $; (3) $, #; (4) $, $. In
which situations will the particle (a)
stop momentarily, (b) pass through the
origin, and (c) never pass through the
origin?
