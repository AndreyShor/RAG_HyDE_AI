THE  GRAVITATIONAL  FIELD 
IF  
we  pick  up  a  stone  and  then  let  it  go,  why  does  it 
fall  to  the  ground  ?  "  The  usual  answer  to  this 
question  is^f  *•  Because  it  is  attracted  by  the  earth." 
Modern  physics  formulates  the  answer  rather  differently 
for  the  following  reason.  As  a  result  of  the  more  careful 
study  of  electromagnetic  phenomena,  we  have  come 
to  regard  action  at  a  distance  as  a  process  impossible 
without  the  intervention  of  some  intermediary  medium. 
If,  for  instance,  a  mag^lt  attracts  a  piece  of  iron,  we 
cannot  be  content  to  regard  this  as  meaning  that  the 
magnet  acts  directly  op  the  iron  through  the  inter 
mediate  empty  space,  tout  we  are  constrained  to  im 
agine — after  the  manner  of  Faraday — that  the  magnet 
always  calls  into  being  something  physically  real  in 
the  space  around  it,  that  something  being  what  we  call  a 
"  magnetic  field."  In  its  turn  this  magnetic  field 
operates  on  the  piece  of  iron,  so  that  the  latter  strives 
to  move  towards  the  magnet.  We  shall  not  discuss 
here  the  justification  for  this  incidental  conception, 
which  is  indeed  a  somewhat  arbitrary  one.  We  shall 
only  mention  that  with  its  aid  electromagnetic  pheno 
mena  can  be  theoretically  represented  much  more 
satisfactorily  than  without  it,  and  this  applies  partic 
ularly  to  the  transmission  of  electromagnetic  waves.
