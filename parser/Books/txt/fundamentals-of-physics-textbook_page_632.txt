J as heat (a) from a reservoir at 7.0 C to one at 27 C,(b) from a reser-
voir at $73 C to one at 27 C,(c) from a reservoir at $173 C to one at
27 C,and (d) from a reservoir at $223 C to one at 27 C?

A heat pump is used to heat a building. The external
temperature is less than the internal temperature. The pump’s co-
efficient of performance is 3.8, and the heat pump delivers 7.54 MJ
as heat to the building each hour. If the heat pump is a Carnot en-
gine working in reverse, at what rate must work be done to run it?
•38
The electric motor of a heat pump transfers energy as heat
from the outdoors, which is at $5.0 C, to a room that is at 17 C. If
the heat pump were a Carnot heat pump (a Carnot engine working
in reverse), how much energy would be transferred as heat to the
room for each joule of electric energy consumed?
•39
A Carnot air conditioner takes energy from the thermal
energy of a room at 70 F and transfers it as heat to the outdoors,
which is at 96 F.For each joule of electric energy required to operate
the air conditioner, how many joules are removed from the room?
•40
To make ice, a freezer that is a reverse Carnot engine extracts
42 kJ as heat at $15 C during each cycle, with coefficient of
performance 5.7. The room temperature is 30.3 C. How much
(a) energy per cycle is delivered as heat to the room and (b) work
per cycle is required to run the freezer?
••41
An air conditioner operating between 93 F and 70 F is rated
at 4000 Btu/h cooling capacity.Its coefficient of performance is 27% of
that of a Carnot refrigerator operating between the same two tempera-
tures.What horsepower is required of the air conditioner motor?
••42
The motor in a refrigerator has a power of 200 W. If the freez-
ing compartment is at 270 K and the outside air is at 300 K, and as-
suming the efficiency of a Carnot refrigerator, what is the maximum
amount of energy that can be extracted as heat from the freezing
compartment in 10.0 min?

resents a Carnot engine

peratures T1
400 K and

150 K and drives a
Carnot refrigerator that
works between tempera-
tures T3 # 325 K and T4 #
225 K. What is the ratio
Q3/Q1?
••44
(a) During each cy-
cle, a Carnot engine ab-
sorbs 750 J as heat from a
high-temperature 
reser-
voir at 360 K, with the
low-temperature reservoir at 280 K. How much work is done per
cycle? (b) The engine is then made to work in reverse to function
as a Carnot refrigerator between those same two reservoirs.
During each cycle, how much work is required to remove 1200 J as
heat from the low-temperature reservoir?

A box contains N identical gas molecules equally divided
between its two halves. For N # 50, what are (a) the multiplicity W
of the central configuration, (b) the total number of microstates,
and (c) the percentage of the time the system spends in the central
configuration? For N # 100, what are (d) W of the central configura-

A Carnot engine is set up to produce a certain work W
per cycle. In each cycle, energy in the form of heat QH is
transferred to the working substance of the engine from
the higher-temperature thermal reservoir, which is at an adjustable
temperature TH.The lower-temperature thermal reservoir is main-
tained at temperature TL # 250 K. Figure 20-28 gives QH for a
range of TH. The scale of the vertical axis is set by QHs # 6.0 kJ. If
TH is set at 550 K, what is QH?
