TRANSLATOR'S    NOTE 
IN     
presenting    this    translation    to    the     English- 
reading    public,  it  is    hardly  necessary  for  me  to 
enlarge  on  the  Author's  prefatory  remarks,  except 
to  draw  attention  to  those  additions  to  the  book  which 
do  not  appear  in  the  original. 
At  my  request,  Professor  Einstein  kindly  supplied 
me  with  a  portrait  of  himself,  by  one  of  Germany's 
most  celebrated  artists.  Appendix  III,  on  "  The 
Experimental  Confirmation  of  the  General  Theory  of 
Relativity,"  has  been  written  specially  for  this  trans 
lation.  Apart  from  these  valuable  additions  to  the  book, 
I  have  included  a  biographical  note  on  the  Author, 
and,  at  the  end  of  the  book,  an  Index  and  a  list  of 
English  references  to  the  sub j ect .  This  list ,  which  is  more 
suggestive  than  exhaustive,  is  intended  as  a  guide  to  those 
readers  who  wish  to  pursue  the  subject  farther. 
I  desire  to  tender  my  best  thanks  to  my  colleagues 
Professor  S.  R.  Milner,  D.Sc.,  and  Mr.  W.  E.  Curtis, 
A.R.C.SC.,  F.R.A.S.,  also  to  my  friend  Dr.  Arthur 
Holmes,  A.R.C.Sc.,  F.G.S.,  of  the  Imperial  College, 
for  their  kindness  in  reading  through  the  manuscript,
