OSCILLATIONS
Frequency
The frequency f of periodic, or oscillatory, motion is
the number of oscillations per second. In the SI system, it is mea-
sured in hertz:
1 hertz $ 1 Hz $ 1 oscillation per second $ 1 s!1.
(15-1)
Period
The period T is the time required for one complete oscil-
lation, or cycle. It is related to the frequency by
(15-2)
Simple Harmonic Motion
In simple harmonic motion (SHM),
the displacement x(t) of a particle from its equilibrium position is
described by the equation
x $ xm cos(vt % f)
(displacement),
(15-3)
in which xm is the amplitude of the displacement, vt % f is the
phase of the motion, and f is the phase constant. The angular fre-
quency v is related to the period and frequency of the motion by
(angular frequency).
(15-5)
Differentiating Eq. 15-3 leads to equations for the particle’s SHM
velocity and acceleration as functions of time:
v $ !vxm sin(vt % f)
(velocity)
(15-6)
and
a $ !v2xm cos(vt % f)
(acceleration).
(15-7)
In Eq. 15-6, the positive quantity vxm is the velocity amplitude vm
of the motion. In Eq. 15-7, the positive quantity v2xm is the acceler-
ation amplitude am of the motion.
The Linear Oscillator
A particle with mass m that moves un-
der the influence of a Hooke’s law restoring force given by F $
!kx exhibits simple harmonic motion with
(angular frequency)
(15-12)
and
(period).
(15-13)
Such a system is called a linear simple harmonic oscillator.
Energy
A particle in simple harmonic motion has, at any time,
kinetic energy K
mv2 and potential energy U
kx2. If no fric-
tion is present, the mechanical energy E
K
U remains con-
stant even though K and U change.

Review & Summary
Pendulums
Examples of devices that undergo simple
harmonic motion are the torsion pendulum of Fig. 15-9, the simple
pendulum of Fig. 15-11, and the physical pendulum of Fig. 15-12.
Their periods of oscillation for small oscillations are, respectively,
(torsion pendulum),
(15-23)
(simple pendulum),
(15-28)
(physical pendulum).

Simple Harmonic Motion and Uniform Circular Motion
Simple harmonic motion is the projection of uniform circular
motion onto the diameter of the circle in which the circular motion
occurs. Figure 15-15 shows that all parameters of circular motion
(position, velocity, and acceleration) project to the corresponding
values for simple harmonic motion.
Damped Harmonic Motion
The mechanical energy E in a real
oscillating system decreases during the oscillations because external
forces, such as a drag force, inhibit the oscillations and transfer me-
chanical energy to thermal energy.The real oscillator and its motion
are then said to be damped. If the damping force is given by 
d $
!b , where 
is the velocity of the oscillator and b is a damping con-
stant, then the displacement of the oscillator is given by
x(t) $ xm e!bt/2m cos(v#t % f),
(15-42)
where v#, the angular frequency of the damped oscillator, is
given by
(15-43)
If the damping constant is small (b &
), then v# % v, where v
is the angular frequency of the undamped oscillator. For small b,
the mechanical energy E of the oscillator is given by
E(t) % kx2
m e!bt/m.
(15-44)
Forced Oscillations and Resonance
If an external 
driving force with angular frequency vd acts on an oscillating sys-
tem with natural angular frequency v, the system oscillates with
angular frequency vd. The velocity amplitude vm of the system is
greatest when
vd $ v,
(15-46)
a condition called resonance. The amplitude xm of the system is
(approximately) greatest under the same condition.
