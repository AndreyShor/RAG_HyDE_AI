CONDUCTION OF ELECTRICITY IN SOLIDS
(b) Next,determine the number of states N in the sample within
a small energy range )E of 0.003 eV centered at 7 eV (the
range is small relative to the energy level in the band).
Calculation: From Eq. 41-5 and Fig. 41-6, we know that the
density of states is a function of energy E. However, for an
energy range )E that is small relative to E, we can approxi-
mate the density of states (and thus the number of states
per electron-volt) to be constant.Thus, at an energy of 7 eV,
we find the number of states N in the energy range )E of
0.003 eV as
or

(When you are asked for the number of states in a certain
energy range, first see if that range is small enough to allow
this type of approximation.)

Sample Problem 41.03
Number of states per electron volt in a metal
(a) Using the data of Fig. 41-6, determine the number of
states per electron-volt at 7 eV in a metal sample with a vol-
ume V of 2 " 10 #9 m3.
KEY IDEA
We can obtain the number of states per electron-volt at a
given energy by using the density of states N(E) at that en-
ergy and the sample’s volume V.
Calculations: At an energy of 7 eV, we write
From Fig. 41-6, we see that at an energy E of 7 eV, the den-
sity of states is about 1.8 " 10 28 m#3 eV#1.Thus,

The Occupancy Probability P(E)
If an energy level is available at energy E, what is the probability P(E) that it is
actually occupied by an electron? At T ! 0 K, we know that all levels with
energies below the Fermi energy are certainly occupied (P(E) = 1) and all higher
levels are certainly not occupied (P(E)
0). Figure 41-7a illustrates this situa-
tion. To find P(E) at temperatures above absolute zero, we must use a set of
quantum counting rules called Fermi–Dirac statistics, named for the physicists
who introduced them.With these rules, the occupancy probability P(E) is
(occupancy probability),
(41-6)
in which EF is the Fermi energy. Note that P(E) depends not on the energy E of
the level but only on the difference E # EF, which may be positive or negative.
To see whether Eq. 41-6 describes Fig. 41-7a, we substitute T ! 0 K in it.Then,
For E / EF, the exponential term in Eq. 41-6 is e#,, or zero; so P(E) ! 1, in
agreement with Fig. 41-7a.
For E . EF, the exponential term is e',; so P(E) ! 0, again in agreement with
Fig. 41-7a.

Figure 41-7 The occupancy probability P(E)
is the probability that an energy level will
be occupied by an electron. (a) At T ! 0 K,
P(E) is unity for levels with energies E up
to the Fermi energy EF and zero for levels
with higher energies. (b) At T ! 1000 K, a
few electrons whose energies were slightly
less than the Fermi energy at T ! 0 K move
up to states with energies slightly greater
than the Fermi energy.The dot on the curve
shows that, for E ! EF, P(E) ! 0.5.
