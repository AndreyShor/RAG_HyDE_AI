RELATIVITY  OF  SIMULTANEITY       27 
Now  before  the  advent  of  the  theory  of  relativity 
it  had  always  tacitly  been  assumed  in  physics  that  the 
statement  of  time  had  an  absolute  significance,  i.e. 
that  it  is  independent  of  the  state  of  motion  of  the  body 
of  reference.  But  we  have  just  seen  that  this  assump 
tion  is  incompatible  with  the  most  natural  definition 
of  simultaneity  ;  if  we  discard  this  assumption,  then 
the  conflict  between  the  law  of  the  propagation  of 
light  in  vacua  and  the  principle  of  relativity  (developed 
in  Section  VII)  disappears. 
We  were  led  to  that  conflict  by  the  considerations 
of  Section  VI,  which  are  now  no  longer  tenable.  In 
that  section  we  concluded  that  the  man  in  the  carriage, 
who  traverses  the  distance  w  per  second  relative  to  the 
carriage,  traverses  the  same  distance  also  with  respect  to 
the  embankment  in  each  second  of  time.  But,  according 
to  the  foregoing  considerations,  the  time  required  by  a 
particular  occurrence  with  respect  to  the  carriage  must 
not  be  considered  equal  to  the  duration  of  the  same 
occurrence  as  judged  from  the  embankment  (as  refer 
ence-body).  Hence  it  cannot  be  contended  that  the 
man  in  walking  travels  the  distance  w  relative  to  the 
railway  line  in  a  time  which  is  equal  to  one  second  as 
judged  from  the  embankment. 
Moreover,  the  considerations  of  Section  VI  are  based 
on  yet  a  second  assumption,  which,  in  the  light  of  a 
strict  consideration,  appears  to  be  arbitrary,  although 
it  was  always  tacitly  made  even  before  the  introduction 
of  the  theory  of  relativity.
