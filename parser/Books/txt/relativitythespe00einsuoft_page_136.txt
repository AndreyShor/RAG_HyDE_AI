But  from  what  has  been  said,  the  two  snapshots 
must  be  identical ;  hence  A*  in  (7)  must  be  equal  to 
A*'  in  (jo) ,  so  that  we  obtain 
The  equations  (6)  and  (76)  determine  the  constants  a 
and  b.  By  inserting  the  values  of  these  constants  in  (5), 
we  obtain  the  first  and  the  fourth  of  the  equations 
given  in  Section  XI.

Thus  we  have  obtained  the  Lorentz  transformation 
for  events  on  the  #-axis.  It  satisfies  the  condition 
The  extension  of  this  result,  to  include  events  which 
take  place  outside  the  #-axis,  is  obtained  by  retaining 
equations  (8)  and  supplementing  them  by  the  relations

In  this  way  we  satisfy  the  postulate  of  the  constancy  of 
the  velocity  of  light  in  vacua  for  rays  of  light  of  arbitrary 
direction,  both  for  the  system  K  and  for  the  system  K', 
This  may  be  shown  in  the  following  manner. 
We  suppose  a  light -signal  sent  out  from  the  origin 
of  K  at  the  time  £=o.  It  will  be  propagated  according 
to  the  equation
