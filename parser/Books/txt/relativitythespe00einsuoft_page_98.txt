80     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
disc  K'  is  sensible  of  a  force  which  acts  outwards  in  a 
radial  direction,  and  which  would  be  interpreted  as  an 
effect  of  inertia  (centrifugal  force)  by  an  observer  who 
was  at  rest  with  respect  to  the  original  reference-body  K. 
But  the  observer  on  the  disc  may  regard  his  disc  as  a 
reference-body  which  is  "at  rest  "  ;  on  the  basis  of  the 
general  principle  of  relativity  he  is  justified  in  doing  this. 
The  force  acting  on  himself,  and  in  fact  on  all  other 
bodies  which  are  at  rest  relative  to  the  disc,  he  regards 
as  the  effect  of  a  gravitational  field.  Nevertheless, 
the  space-distribution  of  this  gravitational  field  is  of  a 
kind  that  would  not  be  possible  on  Newton's  theory  of 
gravitation.1  But  since  the  observer  believes  in  the 
general  theory  of  relativity,  this  does  not  disturb  him ; 
he  is  quite  in  the  right  when  he  believes  that  a  general 
law  of  gravitation  can  be  formulatedâ€” a  law  which  not 
only  explains  the  motion  of  the  stars  correctly,  but 
also  the  field  of  force  experienced  by  himself. 
The  observer  performs  experiments  on  his  circular 
disc  with  clocks  and  measuring-rods.  In  doing  so,  it 
is  his  intention  to  arrive  at  exact  definitions  for  the 
signification  of  time-  and  space-data  with  reference 
to  the  circular  disc  K',  these  definitions  being  based  on 
his  observations.  What  will  be  his  experience  in  this 
enterprise  ? 
To  start  with,  he  places  one  of  two  identically  con 
structed  clocks  at  the  centre  of  the  circular  disc,  and  the ' 
other  on  the  edge  of  the  disc,  so  that  they  are  at  rest 
relative  to  it.     We  now  ask  ourselves  whether  both 
clocks  go  at  the  same  rate  from  the  standpoint  of  the 
1  The  field  disappears  at  the  centre  of  the  disc  and  increases 
proportionally  to  the  distance  from  the  centre  as  we  proceed 
outwards.
