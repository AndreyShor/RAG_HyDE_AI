92  GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
two  neighbouring  events,  the  relative  position  of  which 
in  the  four-dimensional  continuum  is  given  with  respect 
to  a  Galileian  reference-body  K  by  the  space  co-ordinate 
differences  dx,  dy,  dz  and  the  time-difference  dt.  With 
reference  to  a  second  Galileian  system  we  shall  suppose 
that  the  corresponding  differences  for  these  two  events 
are  dx',  dy',  dz',  dt'.  Then  these  magnitudes  always 
fulfil  the  condition  x 
The  validity  of  the  Lorentz  transformation  follows 
from  this  condition.  We  can  express  this  as  follows  : 
The  magnitude 
which  belongs  to  two  adjacent  points  of  the  four- 
dimensional  space-time  continuum,  has  the  same  value 
for  all  selected  (Galileian)  reference-bodies.  If  we  re 
place  x,  y,  z,  >J  -  i  ct,  by  xit  x2,  xs,  #4,  we  also  obtain  the 
result  that 
is  independent  of  the  choice  of  the  body  of  reference. 
We  call  the  magnitude  ds  the  "  distance  "  apart  of  the 
two  events  or  four-dimensional  points. 
Thus,  if  we  choose  as  time-variable  the  imaginary 
variable  \l  -  1  ct  instead  of  the  real  quantity  t,  we  can 
regard  the  space-time  continuum  —  in  accordance  with 
the  special  theory  of  relativity  —  as  a  "  Euclidean  " 
four-dimensional  continuum,  a  result  which  follows 
from  the  considerations  of  the  preceding  section. 
1  Cf.  Appendices  I  and  II.  The  relations  which  are  derived 
there  for  the  co-ordinates  themselves  are  valid  also  for  co 
ordinate  differences,  and  thus  also  for  co-ordinate  differentials 
(indefinitely  small  differences).
