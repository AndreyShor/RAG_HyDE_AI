it must contract mostly in a plane. (Incidentally, if you are looking
for a good problem, the exact details of how the arms are formed and
what determines the shapes of these galaxies have not been worked
out.) It is, however, clear that the shape of the galaxy is due to gravi-
tation even though the complexities of its structure have not yet al-
lowed us to analyze it completely. In a galaxy we have a scale of
perhaps 50,000 to 100,000 light-years. The earth’s distance from the
sun is 81/3 light-minutes, so you can see how large these dimensions are.
Gravity appears to exist at even bigger dimensions, as indicated
by Fig. 5-10, which shows many “little” things clustered together.
This is a cluster of galaxies, just like a star cluster. Thus galaxies at-
tract each other at such distances that they too are agglomerated
into clusters. Perhaps gravitation exists even over distances of tens
of millions of light-years; so far as we now know, gravity seems to
go out forever inversely as the square of the distance.
Not only can we understand the nebulae, but from the law of
gravitation we can even get some ideas about the origin of the stars.
If we have a big cloud of dust and gas, as indicated in Fig. 5-11,
the gravitational attractions of the pieces of dust for one another
