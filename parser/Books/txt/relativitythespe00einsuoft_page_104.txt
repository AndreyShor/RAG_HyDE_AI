86    GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
the  distance  without  our  proceeding  being  in  the  highest 
measure  grossly  arbitrary  ?  The  method  of  Cartesian 
co-ordinates  must  then  be  discarded,  and  replaced  by 
another  which  does  not  assume  the  validity  of  Euclidean 
geometry  for  rigid  bodies.1  The  reader  will  notice  that 
the  situation  depicted  here  corresponds  to  the  one 
brought  about  by  the  general  postulate  of  relativity 
(Section  XXIII).' 
1  Mathematicians  have  been  confronted  with  our  problem  in  the 
following  form.  If  we  are  given  a  surface  (e.g.  an  ellipsoid)  in 
Euclidean  three-dimensional  space,  then  there  exists  for  this 
surface  a  two-dimensional  geometry,  just  as  much  as  for  a  plane 
surface.  Gauss  undertook  the  task  of  treating  this  two-dimen 
sional  geometry  from  first  principles,  without  making  use  of  the 
fact  that  the  surface  belongs  to  a  Euclidean  continuum  of 
three  dimensions.  If  we  imagine  constructions  to  be  made  with 
rigid  rods  in  the  surface  (similar  to  that  above  with  the  marble 
slab),  we  should  find  that  different  laws  hold  for  these  from  those 
resulting  on  the  basis  of  Euclidean  plane  geometry.  The  surface 
is  not  a  Euclidean  continuum  with  respect  to  the  rods,  and  we 
cannot  define  Cartesian  co-ordinates  in  the  surface.  Gauss 
indicated  the  principles  according  to  which  we  can  treat  the 
geometrical  relationships  in  the  surface,  and  thus  pointed  out 
the  way  to  the  method  of  Riemann  of  treating  multi-dimen 
sional,  non-Euclidean  conlinua.  Thus  it  is  that  mathematicians 
long  ago  solved  the  formal  problems  to  which  we  are  led  by  the 
general  postulate  of  relativity.
