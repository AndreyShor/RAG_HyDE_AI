apple’s release, the balloon is accelerating upward with a magni-
tude of 4.0 m/s2 and has an upward velocity of magnitude 2 m/s.
What are the (a) magnitude and (b) direction of the acceleration of
the apple just after it is released? (c) Just then, is the apple moving
upward or downward, or is it stationary? (d) What is the magni-
tude of its velocity just then? (e) In the next few moments, does the
speed of the apple increase, decrease, or remain constant?

Figure 2-23 shows that a particle moving along an x axis un-
dergoes three periods of acceleration. Without written computa-
tion, rank the acceleration periods according to the increases
they produce in the particle’s velocity, greatest first.
“Cogito ergo zoom!” (I think, therefore I go fast!). In 2001, Sam
Whittingham beat Huber’s record by 19.0 km/h. What was
Whittingham’s time through the 200 m?

Two trains, each having a speed of 30 km/h, are headed at
each other on the same straight track. A bird that can fly 60 km/h
flies off the front of one train when they are 60 km apart and heads
directly for the other train. On reaching the other train, the (crazy)
bird flies directly back to the first train, and so forth.What is the to-
tal distance the bird travels before the trains collide?

Panic escape. Figure 2-24 shows a general situation in
which a stream of people attempt to escape through an exit door
that turns out to be locked. The people move toward the door at
speed vs " 3.50 m/s, are each d " 0.25 m in depth, and are sepa-
rated by L " 1.75 m. The
arrangement in Fig. 2-24
occurs at time t " 0. (a) At
what average rate does the
layer of people at the door
increase? (b) At what time
does the layer’s depth reach
5.0 m? (The answers reveal
how quickly such a situation
becomes dangerous.)

In 1 km races,runner 1 on track 1 (with time 2 min,27.95 s)
appears to be faster than runner 2 on track 2 (2 min, 28.15 s).
However, length L2 of track 2 might be slightly greater than length
L1 of track 1. How large can L2 $ L1 be for us still to conclude that
runner 1 is faster?

While driving a car at 90 km/h, how far do you move while
your eyes shut for 0.50 s during a hard sneeze?
•2
Compute your average velocity in the following two cases:
(a) You walk 73.2 m at a speed of 1.22 m/s and then run 73.2 m at a
speed of 3.05 m/s along a straight track. (b) You walk for 1.00 min
at a speed of 1.22 m/s and then run for 1.00 min at 3.05 m/s along a
straight track. (c) Graph x versus t for both cases and indicate how
the average velocity is found on the graph.

An automobile travels on a straight road for
40 km at 30 km/h. It then continues in the same direction for an-
other 40 km at 60 km/h. (a) What is the average velocity of the car
during the full 80 km trip? (Assume that it moves in the positive x
direction.) (b) What is the average speed? (c) Graph x versus t and
indicate how the average velocity is found on the graph.

position of the object at the following values of t: (a) 1 s, (b) 2 s,

The 1992 world speed record for a bicycle (human-powered
vehicle) was set by Chris Huber. His time through the measured
200 m stretch was a sizzling 6.509 s, at which he commented,

of equal heights. Rank the windows according
to (a) the average speed of the cream tangerine
while passing them, (b) the time the cream tan-
