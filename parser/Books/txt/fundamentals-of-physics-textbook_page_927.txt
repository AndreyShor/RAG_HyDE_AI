At time t ! 0, a 12.0 V potential difference is suddenly
applied to the leads of a coil of inductance 23.0 mH and a certain
resistance R. At time t ! 0.150 ms, the current through the induc-
tor is changing at the rate of 280 A/s. Evaluate R.

In Fig. 30-71, the battery is
ideal and 
10 V, R1
5.0 
,
R2 ! 10 ", and L ! 5.0 H. Switch S
is 
closed 
at 
time 
t ! 0.
Just
afterwards, what are (a) i1, (b) i2,
(c) the current iS through the switch,
(d) the potential difference V2
across resistor 2, (e) the potential
difference VL across the inductor,
and (f) the rate of change di2/dt? A
long time later, what are (g) i1, (h) i2,
(i) iS, (j) V2, (k) VL, and (l) di2/dt?

Figure 30-72a shows a
rectangular conducting loop of
resistance
R ! 0.020
",
height 
H ! 1.5 cm, and length D ! 2.5
cm being pulled at constant speed
v ! 40 cm/s through two regions
of uniform magnetic field. Figure
30-72b gives the current i induced
in the loop as a function of the
position x of the right side of the
loop. The vertical axis scale is set
by is ! 3.0 mA. For example, a cur-
rent equal to is is induced clock-
wise as the loop enters region 1.
What are the (a) magnitude and
(b) direction (into or out of the page) of the magnetic field in
region 1? What are the (c) magnitude and (d) direction of the mag-
netic field in region 2?

A uniform magnetic field 
is perpendicular to the plane of a
circular wire loop of radius r. The magnitude of the field varies
with time according to B ! B0e't/t, where B0 and t are constants.
Find an expression for the emf in the loop as a function of time.

Switch S in Fig. 30-63 is closed at time t ! 0, initiating the
buildup of current in the 15.0 mH inductor and the 20.0 " resistor.
At what time is the emf across the inductor equal to the potential
difference across the resistor?
84
Figure 30-73a shows two
concentric circular regions in
which uniform magnetic fields can
change. Region 1, with radius r1 !
1.0 cm, has an outward magnetic
field 
that is increasing in magni-
tude. Region 2, with radius r2
2.0 cm, has an outward magnetic
field 
that may also be changing.
Imagine that a conducting ring of
radius R is centered on the two re-
gions and then the emf # around
the ring is determined. Figure 
30-73b gives emf # as a function of
the square R2 of the ring’s radius,
to the outer edge of region 2. The
vertical axis scale is set by #s !
20.0 nV. What are the rates
(a) dB1/dt and (b) dB2/dt? (c) Is
the magnitude of 
increasing,
decreasing, or remaining constant?

Figure 30-74 shows a uni-
form magnetic field 
confined to
a cylindrical volume of radius R.
The magnitude of 
is decreasing
at a constant rate of 10 mT/s. In
unit-vector notation, what is the
initial acceleration of an electron
released at (a) point a (radial dis-
tance r ! 5.0 cm), (b) point b (r !
0),and (c) point c (r ! 5.0 cm)?

A rectangular loop of N
closely packed turns is positioned
near a long straight wire as shown in
Fig. 30-68.What is the mutual induc-
tance M for the loop–wire combina-
tion if N ! 100, a ! 1.0 cm, b !

A coil C of N turns is placed
around a long solenoid S of radius
R and n turns per unit length, as in
Fig. 30-69. (a) Show that the mutual
inductance for the coil–solenoid
combination 
is 
given 
by

m0pR2nN. (b) Explain why M does
not depend on the shape, size, or pos-
sible lack of close packing of the coil.

Two coils connected as
shown in Fig. 30-70 separately have inductances L1 and L2. Their
mutual inductance is M. (a) Show that this combination can be re-
placed by a single coil of equivalent inductance given by
Leq ! L1 $ L2 $ 2M.
(b) How could the coils in Fig. 30-70 be reconnected to yield an
equivalent inductance of
Leq ! L1 $ L2 ' 2M?
(This problem is an extension of Problem 47, but the requirement
that the coils be far apart has been removed.)
