56      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
events  (realised  or  at  least  thinkable)  as  we  care  to 
choose,  the  co-ordinates  xlt  ylt  zlt  ^  of  which  differ 
by  an  indefinitely  small  amount  from  those  of  the 
event  x,  y,  z,  t  originally  considered.  That  we  have  not 
been  accustomed  to  regard  the  world  in  this  sense  as  a 
four-dimensional  continuum  is  due  to  the  fact  that  in 
physics,  before  the  advent  of  the  theory  of  relativity, 
time  played  a  different  and  more  independent  role,  as 
compared  with  the  space  co-ordinates.  It  is  for  this 
reason  that  we  have  been  in  the  habit  of  treating  time 
as  an  independent  continuum.  As  a  matter  of  fact, 
according  to  classical  mechanics,  time  is  absolute, 
i.e.  it  is  independent  of  the  position  and  the  condition 
of  motion  of  the  system  of  co-ordinates.  We  see  this 
expressed  in  the  last  equation  of  the  Galileian  trans 
formation  (t'=t}. 
The  four-dimensional  mode  of  consideration  of  the 
"  world  "  is  natural  on  the  theory  of  relativity,  since 
according  to  this  theory  time  is  robbed  of  its  independ 
ence.  This  is  shown  by  the  fourth  equation  of  the 
Lorentz  transformation : 
Moreover,  according  to  this  equation  the  time  difference 
AÂ£'  of  two  events  with  respect  to  K'  does  not  in  general 
vanish,  even  when  the  time  difference  A2  of  the  same 
events  with  reference  to  K  vanishes.  Pure  "  space- 
distance  "  of  two  events  with  respect  to  K  results  in 
"  time-distance  "  of  the  same  events  with  respect  to  K'. 
But  the  discovery  of  Minkowski,  which  was  of  import-
