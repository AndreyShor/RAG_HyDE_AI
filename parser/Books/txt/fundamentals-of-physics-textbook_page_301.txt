10-5 CALCULATING THE ROTATIONAL INERTIA
and thus must each be zero. Because x2 & y2 is equal to R2, where R is the dis-
tance from O to dm, the first integral is simply Icom, the rotational inertia of the
body about an axis through its center of mass. Inspection of Fig. 10-12 shows that
the last term in Eq. 10-37 is Mh2, where M is the body’s total mass. Thus,
Eq. 10-37 reduces to Eq. 10-36, which is the relation that we set out to prove.
Checkpoint 5
The figure shows a book-like object (one side is
longer than the other) and four choices of rotation
axes, all perpendicular to the face of the object.
Rank the choices according to the rotational inertia
of the object about the axis, greatest first.

left and L for the particle on the right. Now Eq. 10-33
gives us
I ! m(0)2 & mL2 ! mL2.
(Answer)
Second technique: Because we already know Icom about an
axis through the center of mass and because the axis here is
parallel to that “com axis,” we can apply the parallel-axis
theorem (Eq. 10-36).We find

Sample Problem 10.06
Rotational inertia of a two-particle system
Figure 10-13a shows a rigid body consisting of two particles of
mass m connected by a rod of length L and negligible mass.
(a) What is the rotational inertia Icom about an axis through the
center of mass,perpendicular to the rod as shown?
KEY IDEA
Because we have only two particles with mass, we can find
the body’s rotational inertia Icom by using Eq. 10-33 rather
than by integration. That is, we find the rotational inertia of
each particle and then just add the results.
Calculations: For the two particles, each at perpendicular
distance 
from the rotation axis, we have
(Answer)
(b) What is the rotational inertia I of the body about an axis
through the left end of the rod and parallel to the first axis
(Fig. 10-13b)?
KEY IDEAS
This situation is simple enough that we can find I using
either of two techniques. The first is similar to the one used
in part (a). The other, more powerful one is to apply the 
parallel-axis theorem.
First technique: We calculate I as in part (a), except here
the perpendicular distance ri is zero for the particle on the
