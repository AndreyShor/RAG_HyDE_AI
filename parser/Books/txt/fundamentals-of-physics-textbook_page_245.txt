Assume the plate's
mass is concentrated
as a particle at the
plate's center of mass.
Here too, assume the
mass is concentrated
as a particle at the
center of mass.
Here too.
Here are those
three particles.
Figure 9-4 (a) Plate P is a metal plate of radius 2R, with a circular hole of radius R.The center of mass of P is at point comP. (b) Disk S.
(c) Disk S has been put back into place to form a composite plate C. The center of mass comS of disk S and the center of mass comC
of plate C are shown. (d) The center of mass comS&P of the combination of S and P coincides with comC, which is at x ! 0.
