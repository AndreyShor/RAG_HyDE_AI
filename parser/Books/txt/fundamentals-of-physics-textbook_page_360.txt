magnitude F of the net force. Because we know Tc, we apply
the force balancing equations to the beam.
Calculations: For the horizontal balance, we can rewrite 
Fnet,x ! 0 as
Fh % Tc ! 0,
(12-20)
and so
Fh ! Tc ! 6093 N.
For the vertical balance, we write Fnet,y ! 0 as
Fv % mg % Tr ! 0.
Substituting Mg for Tr and solving for Fv, we find that
Fv ! (m # M)g ! (85 kg # 430 kg)(9.8 m/s2)
! 5047 N.
From the Pythagorean theorem, we now have

Note that F is substantially greater than either the combined
weights of the safe and the beam, 5000 N, or the tension in
the horizontal wire, 6100 N.

Sample Problem 12.02
Balancing a leaning boom
Figure 12-6a shows a safe (mass M ! 430 kg) hanging  by a
rope (negligible mass) from a boom (a ! 1.9 m and b !
2.5 m) that consists of a uniform hinged beam (m ! 85 kg)
and horizontal cable (negligible mass).
(a) What is the tension Tc in the cable? In other words,what is
the magnitude of the force 
on the beam from the cable?
KEY IDEAS
The system here is the beam alone, and the forces on it are
shown in the free-body diagram of Fig. 12-6b. The force
from the cable is 
. The gravitational force on the beam
acts at the beam’s center of mass (at the beam’s center) and
is represented by its equivalent 
The vertical component
of the force on the beam from the hinge is 
, and the hori-
zontal component of the force from the hinge is 
. The
force from the rope supporting the safe is 
. Because beam,
rope, and safe are stationary, the magnitude of

the weight of the safe: Tr ! Mg.We place the origin O of an
xy coordinate system at the hinge. Because the system is in
static equilibrium, the balancing equations apply to it.
Calculations: Let us start with Eq. 12-9 (tnet,z ! 0). Note
that we are asked for the magnitude of force 
and not of
forces 
and 
acting at the hinge, at point O.To eliminate
and 
from the torque calculation, we should calculate
torques about an axis that is perpendicular to the figure at
point O.Then 
and 
will have moment arms of zero.The
lines of action for

, and 
are dashed in Fig. 12-6b.
The corresponding moment arms are a, b, and b/2.
Writing torques in the form of r"F and using our rule about
signs for torques,the balancing equation tnet,z ! 0 becomes

the hinge.
KEY IDEA
Now we want the horizontal component Fh and vertical
