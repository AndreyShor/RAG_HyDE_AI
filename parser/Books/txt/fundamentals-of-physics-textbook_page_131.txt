5-2 SOME PARTICULAR FORCES
From Eq. 5-8, we substitute mg for Fg, finding

In Fig. 5-7, is the magnitude of the normal force 
greater than, less than, or equal to
mg if the block and table are in an elevator moving upward (a) at constant speed and
(b) at increasing speed?

Friction
If we either slide or attempt to slide a body over a surface, the motion is resisted
by a bonding between the body and the surface. (We discuss this bonding more in
the next chapter.) The resistance is considered to be a single force
called either
the frictional force or simply friction. This force is directed along the surface, op-
posite the direction of the intended motion (Fig. 5-8). Sometimes, to simplify a sit-
uation, friction is assumed to be negligible (the surface, or even the body, is said
to be frictionless).
Tension
When a cord (or a rope, cable, or other such object) is attached to a body and
pulled taut, the cord pulls on the body with a force 
directed away from the
body and along the cord (Fig. 5-9a). The force is often called a tension force
because the cord is said to be in a state of tension (or to be under tension), which
means that it is being pulled taut.The tension in the cord is the magnitude T of the
force on the body. For example, if the force on the body from the cord has magni-
tude T " 50 N, the tension in the cord is 50 N.
A cord is often said to be massless (meaning its mass is negligible compared
to the bodyâ€™s mass) and unstretchable. The cord then exists only as a connection
between two bodies. It pulls on both bodies with the same force magnitude T,

The forces at the two ends of

Figure 5-9 (a) The cord, pulled taut, is under tension. If its mass is negligible, the cord
pulls on the body and the hand with force , even if the cord runs around a massless,
frictionless pulley as in (b) and (c).

Then the magnitude of the normal force is

for any vertical acceleration ay of the table and block (they might be in an accel-
erating elevator). (Caution: We have already included the sign for g but ay can be
positive or negative here.) If the table and block are not accelerating relative to
the ground, then ay " 0 and Eq. 5-13 yields
FN " mg.
