up, it will reach a certain height; we do not know what it is yet,
but it depends on the velocity—there is a formula for that. Then
to ﬁnd the formula for kinetic energy for an object moving with
velocity V, we must calculate the height that it could reach, and
multiply by the weight. We shall soon ﬁnd that we can write it this
way:
(4.6)
Of course, the fact that motion has energy has nothing to do with
the fact that we are in a gravitational ﬁeld. It makes no difference
where the motion came from. This is a general formula for various
velocities. Both (4.3) and (4.6) are approximate formulas, the ﬁrst
because it is incorrect when the heights are great, i.e., when the
heights are so high that gravity is weakening; the second, because
of the relativistic correction at high speeds. However, when we do
ﬁnally get the exact formula for the energy, then the law of conser-
vation of energy is correct.
Other forms of energy
We can continue in this way to illustrate the existence of energy in
other forms. First, consider elastic energy. If we pull down on a
spring, we must do some work, for when we have it down, we can
lift weights with it. Therefore in its stretched condition it has a pos-
sibility of doing some work. If we were to evaluate the sums of
