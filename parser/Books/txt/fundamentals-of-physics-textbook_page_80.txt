gives the direction of .Thus, as shown in the figure,
lies in
the xy plane. Because its direction is perpendicular to the
direction of 
(a cross product always gives a perpendicular
vector), it is at an angle of
250° $ 90° " 160°
(Answer)

Sample Problem 3.06
Cross product, right-hand rule
In Fig. 3-20, vector 
lies in the xy plane, has a magnitude of
18 units, and points in a direction 250° from the positive di-
rection of the x axis. Also, vector 
has a magnitude of
12 units and points in the positive direction of the z axis.What
is the vector product
"
'
?
KEY IDEA
When we have two vectors in magnitude-angle notation, we
find the magnitude of their cross product with Eq. 3-24 and
the direction of their cross product with the right-hand rule
of Fig. 3-19.
Calculations: For the magnitude we write
c " ab sin f " (18)(12)(sin 90°) " 216.
(Answer)
To determine the direction in Fig. 3-20, imagine placing the
fingers of your right hand around a line perpendicular to the
plane of 
and 
(the line on which 
is shown) such that
your fingers sweep 
into . Your outstretched thumb then

We can separately evaluate the left side of Eq. 3-28 by
writing the vectors in unit-vector notation and using the
distributive law:
"
" (3.0 $ 4.0 )"($2.0 # 3.0 )
" (3.0 )"($2.0 ) # (3.0 )"(3.0 )
# ($4.0 )"($2.0 ) # ($4.0 )"(3.0 ).
We next apply Eq. 3-20 to each term in this last expression.
The angle between the unit vectors in the first term ( and ) is
0°,and in the other terms it is 90°.We then have
"
" $(6.0)(1) # (9.0)(0) # (8.0)(0) $ (12)(0)
" $6.0.
Substituting this result and the results of Eqs. 3-29 and 3-30
into Eq. 3-28 yields
$6.0 " (5.00)(3.61) cos f,
so

steps can be bypassed with a vector-capable calculator, you
will learn more about scalar products if, at least here, you
use these steps.)
KEY IDEA 
The angle between the directions of two vectors is included
in the definition of their scalar product (Eq. 3-20):
