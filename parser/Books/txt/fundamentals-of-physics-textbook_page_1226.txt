Two- and Three-Dimensional Electron Traps
In the next module, we shall discuss the hydrogen atom as being a three-
dimensional finite potential well. As a warm-up for the hydrogen atom, let us
extend our discussion of infinite potential wells to two and three dimensions.
Rectangular Corral
Figure 39-13 shows the rectangular area to which an electron can be confined by
the two-dimensional version of Fig. 39-2—a two-dimensional infinite potential
well of widths Lx and Ly that forms a rectangular corral. The corral might be on
the surface of a body that somehow prevents the electron from moving parallel
to the z axis and thus from leaving the surface. You have to imagine infinite
potential energy functions (like U(x) in Fig. 39-2) along each side of the corral,
keeping the electron within the corral.
Solution of Schrödinger’s equation for the rectangular corral of Fig. 39-13
shows that, for the electron to be trapped, its matter wave must fit into each of
the two widths separately, just as the matter wave of a trapped electron must fit
into a one-dimensional infinite well.This means the wave is separately quantized
in width Lx and in width Ly. Let nx be the quantum number for which the
matter wave fits into width Lx, and let ny be the quantum number for which the
matter wave fits into width Ly. As with a one-dimensional potential well,
these quantum numbers can be only positive integers. We can extend Eqs. 39-10
and 39-17 to write the normalized wave function as
(39-19)
The energy of the electron depends on both quantum numbers and is the
sum of the energy the electron would have if it were confined along the x axis
alone and the energy it would have if it were confined along the y axis alone.
From Eq. 39-4, we can write this sum as
(39-20)
Excitation of the electron by photon absorption and de-excitation of the
electron by photon emission have the same requirements as for one-dimensional
traps. Now, however, two quantum numbers (nx and ny) are involved. Because of
that, different states might have the same energy; such states and their energy
levels are said to be degenerate.
Rectangular Box
An electron can also be trapped in a three-dimensional infinite potential well—
a box. If the box is rectangular as in Fig. 39-14, then Schrödinger’s equation shows
us that we can write the energy of the electron as
(39-21)
Here nz is a third quantum number, for fitting the matter wave into width Lz.

Checkpoint 4
In the notation of Eq. 39-20, is E0,0, E1,0, E0,1, or E1,1 the ground-state energy of an
electron in a (two-dimensional) rectangular corral?
