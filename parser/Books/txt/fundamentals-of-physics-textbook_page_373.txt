In Fig. 12-39, a 55 kg
rock climber is in a lie-back climb
along a fissure, with hands pulling on
one side of the fissure and feet
pressed against the opposite side.
The fissure has width w ! 0.20 m,
and the center of mass of the climber
is a horizontal distance d ! 0.40 m
from the fissure. The coefficient of
static friction between hands and
rock is m1 ! 0.40, and between boots
and rock it is m2 ! 1.2. (a) What is the

In Fig. 12-44, a 15 kg block is
held in place via a pulley system. The
person’s upper arm is vertical; the fore-
arm is at angle u ! 30° with the horizon-
tal. Forearm and hand together have a
mass of 2.0 kg,with a center of mass at dis-
tance d1 ! 15 cm from the contact point of
the forearm bone and the upper-arm bone
(humerus). The triceps muscle pulls verti-
cally upward on the forearm at distance d2 ! 2.5 cm behind that
contact point. Distance d3 is 35 cm.What are the (a) magnitude and
(b) direction (up or down) of the force on the forearm from the tri-
ceps muscle and the (c) magnitude and (d) direction (up or down) of
the force on the forearm from the humerus?

In Fig. 12-40, one end of a
uniform beam of weight 222 N is
hinged to a wall; the other end is sup-
ported by a wire that makes angles

In Fig. 12-41, a climber
with a weight of 533.8 N is held by a
belay rope connected to her climbing
harness and belay device; the force of
the rope on her has a line of action
through her center of mass. The indi-
cated angles are u ! 40.0° and f !
30.0°. If her feet are on the verge of
sliding on the vertical wall, what is the
coefficient of static friction between
her climbing shoes and the wall?
