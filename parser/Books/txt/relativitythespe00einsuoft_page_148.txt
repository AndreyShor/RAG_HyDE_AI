or  with  sufficient  accuracy  by 
This  expression  may  also  be  stated  in  the  following 
form  : 
I   0)V2 
If  we  represent  the  difference  of  potential  of  the  centri 
fugal  force  between  the  position  of  the  clock  and  the 
centre  of  the  disc  by  <£,  i.e.  the  work,  considered  nega 
tively,  which  must  be  performed  on  the  unit  of  mass 
against  the  centrifugal  force  in  order  to  transport  it 
from  the  position  of  the  clock  on  the  rotating  disc  to 
the  centre  of  the  disc,  then  we  have 
From  this  it  follows  that 
.'  In  the  first  place,  we  see  from  this  expression  that  two 
'  clocks  of  identical  construction  will  go  at  different  rates 
when  situated  at  different  distances  from  the  centre  of 
*   the  disc.     This  result  is  also  valid  from  the  standpoint 
of  an  observer  who  is  rotating  with  the  disc. 
Now,  as  judged  from  the  disc,  the  latter  is  in  a  gravi 
tational  field  of  potential  <£,  hence  the  result  we  have 
obtained  will  hold  quite  generally  for  gravitational 
fields.  Furthermore,  we  can  regard  an  atom  which  is 
emitting  spectral  lines  as  a  clock,  so  that  the  following 
statement  will  hold : 
An  atom  absorbs  or  emits  light  of  a  frequency  which  is
