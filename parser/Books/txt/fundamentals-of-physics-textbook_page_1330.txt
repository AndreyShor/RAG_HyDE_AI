When aboveground nuclear tests were conducted, the explo-
sions shot radioactive dust into the upper atmosphere. Global air cir-
culations then spread the dust worldwide before it settled out on
ground and water. One such test was conducted in October 1976.
What fraction of the 90Sr produced by that explosion still existed in
October 2006? The half-life of 90Sr is 29 y.

The air in some caves includes a significant amount of radon
gas, which can lead to lung cancer if breathed over a prolonged
time. In British caves, the air in the cave with the greatest amount
of the gas has an activity per volume of 1.55 " 105 Bq/m3. Suppose
that you spend two full days exploring (and sleeping in) that cave.
Approximately how many 222Rn atoms would you take in and out
of your lungs during your two-day stay? The radionuclide 222Rn in
radon gas has a half-life of 3.82 days. You need to estimate your
lung capacity and average breathing rate.

A certain radionuclide is being manufactured in a
cyclotron at a constant rate R. It is also decaying with disintegration
constant l. Assume that the production process has been going on
for a time that is much longer than the half-life of the radionuclide.
(a) Show that the number of radioactive nuclei present after such
time remains constant and is given by N ! R/l. (b) Now show that
this result holds no matter how many radioactive nuclei were pres-
ent initially. The nuclide is said to be in secular equilibrium with its
source; in this state its decay rate is just equal to its production rate.

Plutonium isotope 239Pu decays by alpha decay with a half-
life of 24 100 y. How many milligrams of helium are produced by
an initially pure 12.0 g sample of 239Pu at the end of 20 000 y?

not by any by-products of the decay process.)

The radionuclide 56Mn has a half-life of 2.58 h and is pro-
duced in a cyclotron by bombarding a manganese target with
deuterons. The target contains only the stable manganese isotope
55Mn, and the manganese–deuteron reaction that produces 56Mn is

patient is prepared at a nearby laboratory. The sample has a half-

In 1992, Swiss police arrested two men who were attempting
to smuggle osmium out of Eastern Europe for a clandestine sale.
However, by error, the smugglers had picked up 137Cs. Reportedly,
each smuggler was carrying a 1.0 g sample of 137Cs in a pocket! In
(a) bequerels and (b) curies, what was the activity of each sample?
The isotope 137Cs has a half-life of 30.2 y. (The activities of radio-
isotopes commonly used in hospitals range up to a few millicuries.)

The radioactive nuclide 99Tc can be injected into a patient’s
bloodstream in order to monitor the blood flow, measure the blood
volume, or find a tumor, among other goals. The nuclide is pro-
duced in a hospital by a “cow” containing 99Mo, a radioactive nu-
clide that decays to 99Tc with a half-life of 67 h. Once a day, the cow
is “milked” for its 99Tc, which is produced in an excited state by the
99Mo; the 99Tc de-excites to its lowest energy state by emitting a
gamma-ray photon, which is recorded by detectors placed around
the patient. The de-excitation has a half-life of 6.0 h. (a) By what
process does 99Mo decay to 99Tc? (b) If a patient is injected with an
8.2 " 107 Bq sample of 99Tc, how many gamma-ray photons are
initially produced within the patient each second? (c) If the
emission rate of gamma-ray photons from a small tumor that has
collected 99Tc is 38 per second at a certain time, how many excited-
state 99Tc are located in the tumor at that time?
