CHAPTER 2
MOTION ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE
Combining Eqs. 2-27 and 2-28, we can write
(2-31)
For convenience, let us separate the area into three regions
(Fig. 2-15b). From 0 to 40 ms, region A has no area:
areaA " 0.
From 40 ms to 100 ms,region B has the shape of a triangle,with
area
From 100 ms to 110 ms, region C has the shape of a rectan-
gle, with area
areaC " (0.010 s)(50 m/s2) " 0.50 m/s.
Substituting these values and v0 " 0 into Eq.2-31 gives us
v1 $ 0 " 0 # 1.5 m/s # 0.50 m/s,
or
v1 " 2.0 m/s " 7.2 km/h.
(Answer)
Comments: When the head is just starting to move forward,
the torso already has a speed of 7.2 km/h. Researchers argue
that it is this difference in speeds during the early stage of a
rear-end collision that injures the neck. The backward whip-
ping of the head happens later and could, especially if there is
no head restraint,increase the injury.

Sample Problem 2.06
Graphical integration a versus t, whiplash injury
“Whiplash injury” commonly occurs in a rear-end collision
where a front car is hit from behind by a second car. In the
1970s, researchers concluded that the injury was due to the
occupant’s head being whipped back over the top of the seat
as the car was slammed forward. As a result of this finding,
head restraints were built into cars, yet neck injuries in rear-
end collisions continued to occur.
In a recent test to study neck injury in rear-end collisions,
a volunteer was strapped to a seat that was then moved
abruptly to simulate a collision by a rear car moving at
10.5 km/h. Figure 2-15a gives the accelerations of the volun-
teer’s torso and head during the collision, which began at time
t " 0. The torso acceleration was delayed by 40 ms because
during that time interval the seat back had to compress
against the volunteer. The head acceleration was delayed by
an additional 70 ms.What was the torso speed when the head
began to accelerate?
KEY IDEA
We can calculate the torso speed at any time by finding an
area on the torso a(t) graph.
Calculations: We know that the initial torso speed is v0 " 0
at time t0 " 0, at the start of the “collision.” We want the
torso speed v1 at time t1 " 110 ms, which is when the head
begins to accelerate.

Position
The position x of a particle on an x axis locates the par-
ticle with respect to the origin, or zero point, of the axis.The position
is either positive or negative, according to which side of the origin
the particle is on, or zero if the particle is at the origin. The positive
direction on an axis is the direction of increasing positive numbers;
the opposite direction is the negative direction on the axis.
Displacement
The displacement -x of a particle is the change
in its position:
-x " x2 $ x1.
(2-1)
Displacement is a vector quantity. It is positive if the particle has
moved in the positive direction of the x axis and negative if the
particle has moved in the negative direction.
Review & Summary
Average Velocity
When a particle has moved from position x1
to position x2 during a time interval -t " t2 $ t1, its average velocity
during that interval is
(2-2)
The algebraic sign of vavg indicates the direction of motion (vavg is a
vector quantity). Average velocity does not depend on the actual
distance a particle moves, but instead depends on its original and
final positions.
On a graph of x versus t, the average velocity for a time interval
-t is the slope of the straight line connecting the points on the curve
that represent the two ends of the interval.
