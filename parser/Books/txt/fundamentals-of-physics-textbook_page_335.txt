Both angular momentum

direction.

the generic cross product. Because 
lacks any z component
and because 
lacks any y or z component, the only nonzero
term in the generic cross product is the very last one 
.
So,let’s cut to the (mathematical) chase by writing
Note that, as always, the cross product produces a vector
that is perpendicular to the original vectors.
To finish up Eq. 11-18, we multiply by the mass, finding
(Answer)
The torque about the origin then immediately follows from
Eq. 11-23:

which is in the positive direction of the z axis.
Our result for 
tells us that the angular momentum is
in the positive direction of the z axis. To make sense of that
positive result in terms of the rotation of the position vector,

let’s evaluate that vector for several times:
t ! 0,
t ! 1.00 s,
t ! 2.00 s,
By drawing these results as in Fig. 11-14b, we see that 
ro-
tates counterclockwise in order to keep up with the particle.
That is the positive direction of rotation. Thus, even though
the particle is moving in a straight line, it is still moving
counterclockwise around the origin and thus has a positive
angular momentum.
We can also make sense of the direction of 
by applying
the right-hand rule for cross products (here 
, or, if you
like,
, which gives the same direction). For any mo-
ment during the particle’s motion, the fingers of the right
hand are first extended in the direction of the first vector in
the cross product ( ) as indicated in Fig. 11-14c. The orienta-
tion of the hand (on the page or viewing screen) is then ad-
justed so that the fingers can be comfortably rotated about
the palm to be in the direction of the second vector in the
cross product ( ) as indicated in Fig. 11-14d.The outstretched
thumb then points in the direction of the result of the cross
product. As indicated in Fig. 11-14e, the vector is in the posi-
tive direction of the z axis (which is directly out of the plane
of the figure), consistent with our previous result. Figure
11-14e also indicates the direction of , which is also in the
positive direction of the z axis because the angular momen-
tum is in that direction and is increasing in magnitude.
