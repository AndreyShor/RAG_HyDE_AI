What, then, is wrong with our argument against Proposition A?
Why isn’t P12 just equal to P1 + P2? Back to experiment! Let us keep
track of the electrons and ﬁnd out what they are doing. For each
position (x-location) of the detector we will count the electrons that
arrive and also keep track of which hole they went through, by
watching for the ﬂashes. We can keep track of things this way:
whenever we hear a “click” we will put a count in Column 1 if we
see the ﬂash near hole 1, and if we see the ﬂash near hole 2, we will
record a count in Column 2. Every electron which arrives is
recorded in one of two classes: those which come through 1 and
those which come through 2. From the number recorded in Col-
umn 1 we get the probability P'1 that an electron will arrive at the
detector via hole 1; and from the number recorded in Column 2
we get P'2, the probability that an electron will arrive at the detector
via hole 2. If we now repeat such a measurement for many values
of x, we get the curves for P'1 and P'2 shown in part (b) of Fig. 6-
4.
Well, that is not too surprising! We get for P'1 something quite
similar to what we got before for P, by blocking off hole 2; and P'2
is similar to what we got by blocking hole 1. So there is not any
complicated business like going through both holes. When we
