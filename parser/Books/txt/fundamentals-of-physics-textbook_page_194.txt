CHAPTER 7
KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK
Calculation: We use Eq. 7-47 for each force. For force 
, at
angle f1 ! 180( to velocity , we have
P1 ! F1v cos f1 ! (2.0 N)(3.0 m/s) cos 180(
! $6.0 W.
(Answer)
This negative result tells us that force 
is transferring en-
ergy from the box at the rate of 6.0 J/s.
For force 
, at angle f2 ! 60( to velocity , we have
P2 ! F2v cos f2 ! (4.0 N)(3.0 m/s) cos 60(
! 6.0 W.
(Answer)
This positive result tells us that force 
is transferring en-
ergy to the box at the rate of 6.0 J/s.
The net power is the sum of the individual powers
(complete with their algebraic signs):
Pnet ! P1 " P2
! $6.0 W " 6.0 W ! 0,
(Answer)
which tells us that the net rate of transfer of energy to
or from the box is zero.Thus, the kinetic energy 
of the box is not changing, and so the speed of the box will
remain at 3.0 m/s.With neither the forces 
and 
nor the
velocity 
changing, we see from Eq. 7-48 that P1 and P2 are
constant and thus so is Pnet.

Sample Problem 7.09
Power, force, and velocity
Here we calculate an instantaneous work—that is, the rate at
which work is being done at any given instant rather than av-
eraged over a time interval. Figure 7-15 shows constant forces
and 
acting on a box as the box slides rightward across a
frictionless floor.Force 
is horizontal,with magnitude 2.0 N;

Kinetic Energy
The kinetic energy K associated with the mo-
tion of a particle of mass m and speed v, where v is well below the
speed of light, is
(kinetic energy).
(7-1)
Work
Work W is energy transferred to or from an object via a
force acting on the object. Energy transferred to the object is posi-
tive work, and from the object, negative work.
Work Done by a Constant Force
The work done on a par-
ticle by a constant force 
during displacement 
is
(work, constant force),
(7-7, 7-8)
in which f is the constant angle between the directions of 
and .
Only the component of 
that is along the displacement 
can do
work on the object. When two or more forces act on an object,
their net work is the sum of the individual works done by the
forces, which is also equal to the work that would be done on the
object by the net force 
of those forces.
Work and Kinetic Energy
For a particle, a change %K in the
kinetic energy equals the net work W done on the particle:
%K ! Kf $ Ki ! W

Review & Summary
in which Ki is the initial kinetic energy of the particle and Kf is the ki-
netic energy after the work is done.Equation 7-10 rearranged gives us
Kf ! Ki " W.
(7-11)
Work Done by the Gravitational Force
The work Wg
done by the gravitational force 
on a particle-like object of mass
m as the object moves through a displacement 
is given by
Wg ! mgd cos f,
(7-12)
in which f is the angle between 
and .
Work Done in Lifting and Lowering an Object
The work
Wa done by an applied force as a particle-like object is either lifted
or lowered is related to the work Wg done by the gravitational
force and the change %K in the object’s kinetic energy by
%K ! Kf $ Ki ! Wa " Wg.
(7-15)
If Kf ! Ki, then Eq. 7-15 reduces to
Wa ! $Wg,
(7-16)
which tells us that the applied force transfers as much energy to the
object as the gravitational force transfers from it.

force 
is angled upward by 60( to the floor and has magni-
tude 4.0 N.The speed v of the box at a certain instant is 3.0 m/s.
What is the power due to each force acting on the box at that
instant, and what is the net power? Is the net power changing
at that instant?
KEY IDEA
We want an instantaneous power, not an average power
over a time period.Also, we know the box’s velocity (rather
than the work done on it).
