horizontally. What happens if we shoot a bullet faster and faster?
Do not forget that the earth’s surface is curved. If we shoot it fast
enough, then when it falls 16 feet it may be at just the same height
above the ground as it was before. How can that be? It still falls,
but the earth curves away, so it falls “around” the earth. The ques-
tion is, how far does it have to go in one second so that the earth
is 16 feet below the horizon? In Fig. 5-4 we see the earth with its
4000-mile radius, and the tangential, straight-line path that the
bullet would take if there were no force. Now, if we use one of those
wonderful theorems in geometry, which says that our tangent is the
mean proportional between the two parts of the diameter cut by
an equal chord, we see that the horizontal distance travelled is the
mean proportional between the 16 feet fallen and the 8000-mile
diameter of the earth. The square root of (16/5280) ¥ 8000 comes
out very close to 5 miles. Thus we see that if the bullet moves at 5
miles a second, it then will continue to fall toward the earth at the
same rate of 16 feet each second, but will never get any closer be-
cause the earth keeps curving away from it. Thus it was that Mr.
Gagarin maintained himself in space while going 25,000 miles
around the earth at approximately 5 miles per second. (He took a
little longer because he was a little higher.)
