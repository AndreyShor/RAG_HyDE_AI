A baseball is hit at ground level. The ball reaches its
maximum height above ground level 3.0 s after being hit. Then
2.5 s after reaching its maximum height, the ball barely clears a
fence that is 97.5 m from where it was hit. Assume the ground is
level. (a) What maximum height above ground level is reached by
the ball? (b) How high is the fence? (c) How far beyond the fence
does the ball strike the ground?

Long flights at midlatitudes in the Northern Hemisphere en-
counter the jet stream, an eastward airflow that can affect a plane’s
speed relative to Earth’s surface. If a pilot maintains a certain speed
relative to the air (the plane’s airspeed),the speed relative to the sur-
face (the plane’s ground speed) is more when the flight is in the di-
rection of the jet stream and less when the flight is opposite the jet
stream. Suppose a round-trip flight is scheduled between two cities
separated by 4000 km,with the outgoing flight in the direction of the
jet stream and the return flight opposite it.The airline computer ad-
vises an airspeed of 1000 km/h, for which the difference in flight
times for the outgoing and return flights is 70.0 min.What jet-stream
speed is the computer using?

A particle starts from the origin at t " 0 with a velocity
of 8.0 m/s and moves in the xy plane with constant acceleration
(4.0

are its (a) y coordinate and (b) speed?

At what initial speed
must the basketball player in
Fig. 4-50 throw the ball, at an-
gle u0 " 55° above the hori-
zontal, to make the foul shot?
The horizontal distances are
d1 " 1.0 ft and d2 " 14 ft, and
the heights are h1 " 7.0 ft
and h2 " 10 ft.

During volcanic erup-
tions, chunks of solid rock
can be blasted out of the vol-
cano; these projectiles are
called volcanic bombs. Figure 4-51 shows a cross section of Mt.
Fuji, in Japan. (a) At what initial speed would a bomb have to be
ejected, at angle u0 " 35° to the horizontal, from the vent at A in
order to fall at the foot of the volcano at B, at vertical distance 
h " 3.30 km and horizontal distance d " 9.40 km? Ignore, for the

A radar station detects an airplane approaching directly from
the east. At first observation, the airplane is at distance d1 " 360 m
from the station and at angle u1 " 40° above the horizon (Fig. 4-49).
The airplane is tracked through an angular change -u " 123° in the
vertical east–west plane; its distance is then d2 " 790 m. Find the
(a) magnitude and (b) direction of the airplane’s displacement dur-
ing this period.

An astronaut is rotated in a horizontal centrifuge at a radius
of 5.0 m. (a) What is the astronaut’s speed if the centripetal accel-
eration has a magnitude of 7.0g? (b) How many revolutions per
minute are required to produce this acceleration? (c) What is the
period of the motion?

Oasis A is 90 km due west of oasis B. A desert camel
leaves A and takes 50 h to walk 75 km at 37° north of due east.
Next it takes 35 h to walk 65 km due south. Then it rests for 5.0 h.
What are the (a) magnitude and (b) direction of the camel’s dis-
placement relative to A at the resting point? From the time the
camel leaves A until the end of the rest period, what are the (c)
magnitude and (d) direction of its average velocity and (e) its aver-
age speed? The camel’s last drink was at A; it must be at B no more
than 120 h later for its next drink. If it is to reach B just in time, what
must be the (f) magnitude and (g) direction of its average velocity
after the rest period?

Curtain of death. A large metallic asteroid strikes Earth
and quickly digs a crater into the rocky material below ground level
by launching rocks upward and outward. The following table gives
five pairs of launch speeds and angles (from the horizontal) for such
rocks, based on a model of crater formation. (Other rocks, with inter-
mediate speeds and angles, are also launched.) Suppose that you are
at x " 20 km when the asteroid strikes the ground at time t " 0 and
position x " 0 (Fig. 4-52). (a) At t " 20 s, what are the x and y
coordinates of the rocks headed in your direction from launches A
through E? (b) Plot these coordinates and then sketch a curve
through the points to include rocks with intermediate launch speeds
and angles.The curve should indicate what you would see as you look
up into the approaching rocks.
