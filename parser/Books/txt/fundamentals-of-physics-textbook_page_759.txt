Thus, the magnitude of the electric field produced by a point charge inside a
dielectric is given by this modified form of Eq. 23-15:
(25-28)
Also, the expression for the electric field just outside an isolated conductor
immersed in a dielectric (see Eq. 23-11) becomes
(25-29)
Because k is always greater than unity, both these equations show that for a fixed
distribution of charges, the effect of a dielectric is to weaken the electric field that
would otherwise be present.

25-5 CAPACITOR WITH A DIELECTRIC
KEY IDEA
Because the battery has been disconnected, the charge on
the capacitor cannot change when the dielectric is inserted.
However, the potential does change.
Calculations: Thus, we must now use Eq. 25-21 to write the
final potential energy Uf, but now that the slab is within the
capacitor, the capacitance is kC.We then have
(Answer)
When the slab is introduced, the potential energy decreases
by a factor of k.
The “missing” energy, in principle, would be apparent to
the person who introduced the slab.The capacitor would ex-
ert a tiny tug on the slab and would do work on it, in amount
W ! Ui # Uf ! (1055 # 162) pJ ! 893 pJ.
If the slab were allowed to slide between the plates with no
restraint and if there were no friction, the slab would oscillate
back and forth between the plates with a (constant) mechani-
cal energy of 893 pJ, and this system energy would transfer
back and forth between kinetic energy of the moving slab and
potential energy stored in the electric field.

Work and energy when a dielectric is inserted into a capacitor
A parallel-plate capacitor whose capacitance C is 13.5 pF is
charged by a battery to a potential difference V ! 12.5 V
between its plates. The charging battery is now discon-
nected, and a porcelain slab (k ! 6.50) is slipped between
the plates.
(a) What is the potential energy of the capacitor before the
slab is inserted?
KEY IDEA
We can relate the potential energy Ui of the capacitor to the
capacitance C and either the potential V (with Eq. 25-22) or
the charge q (with Eq. 25-21):
Calculation: Because we are given the initial potential V
(! 12.5 V), we use Eq. 25-22 to find the initial stored
energy:

Dielectrics: An Atomic View
What happens, in atomic and molecular terms, when we put a dielectric in an
electric field? There are two possibilities, depending on the type of molecule:
1. Polar dielectrics. The molecules of some dielectrics, like water, have permanent
electric dipole moments. In such materials (called polar dielectrics), the
