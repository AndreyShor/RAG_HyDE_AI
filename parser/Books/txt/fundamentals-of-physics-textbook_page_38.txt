The cubit is an ancient unit of length based on the distance
between the elbow and the tip of the middle finger of the mea-
surer. Assume that the distance ranged from 43 to 53 cm, and
suppose that ancient drawings indicate that a cylindrical pillar
was to have a length of 9 cubits and a diameter of 2 cubits. For
the stated range, what are the lower value and the upper value,
respectively, for (a) the cylinder’s length in meters, (b) the cylin-
der’s length in millimeters, and (c) the cylinder’s volume in cubic
meters?

As a contrast between the old and the modern and between
the large and the small, consider the following: In old rural
England 1 hide (between 100 and 120 acres) was the area of land
needed to sustain one family with a single plough for one year. (An
area of 1 acre is equal to 4047 m2.) Also, 1 wapentake was the area
of land needed by 100 such families. In quantum physics, the
cross-sectional area of a nucleus (defined in terms of the chance of
a particle hitting and being absorbed by it) is measured in units of
barns, where 1 barn is 1 ' 10$28 m2. (In nuclear physics jargon, if a
nucleus is “large,” then shooting a particle at it is like shooting a
bullet at a barn door, which can hardly be missed.) What is the
ratio of 25 wapentakes to 11 barns?
53
An astronomical unit (AU) is equal to the average
distance from Earth to the Sun, about 92.9
106 mi. A parsec
(pc) is the distance at which a length of 1 AU would subtend an
angle of exactly 1 second of
arc (Fig. 1-8). A light-year (ly)
is the distance that light, trav-
eling through a vacuum with a
speed of 186 000 mi/s, would
cover in 1.0 year. Express the
Earth–Sun distance in (a)
parsecs and (b) light-years.
54
The description for a certain brand of house paint claims a cov-
erage of 460 ft2/gal. (a) Express this quantity in square meters per
liter. (b) Express this quantity in an SI unit (see Appendices A and
D). (c) What is the inverse of the original quantity, and (d) what is its
physical significance?

Strangely, the wine for a large wedding reception is to be
served in a stunning cut-glass receptacle with the interior dimen-
sions of 40 cm ' 40 cm ' 30 cm (height). The receptacle is to be
initially filled to the top. The wine can be purchased in bottles of
the sizes given in the following table. Purchasing a larger bottle in-
stead of multiple smaller bottles decreases the overall cost of the
wine. To minimize the cost, (a) which bottle sizes should be pur-
chased and how many of each should be purchased and, once the
receptacle is filled, how much wine is left over in terms of (b) stan-
dard bottles and (c) liters?

The corn–hog ratio is a financial term used in the pig market
and presumably is related to the cost of feeding a pig until it is
large enough for market. It is defined as the ratio of the market
price of a pig with a mass of 3.108 slugs to the market price of a
U.S. bushel of corn. (The word “slug” is derived from an old
German word that means “to hit”; we have the same meaning for
“slug” as a verb in modern English.) A U.S. bushel is equal to
35.238 L. If the corn–hog ratio is listed as 5.7 on the market ex-
change, what is it in the metric units of
(Hint: See the Mass table in Appendix D.)

You are to fix dinners for 400 people at a convention of
Mexican food fans. Your recipe calls for 2 jalapeño peppers per
serving (one serving per person). However, you have only ha-
banero peppers on hand. The spiciness of peppers is measured in
terms of the scoville heat unit (SHU). On average, one jalapeño
pepper has a spiciness of 4000 SHU and one habanero pepper has
a spiciness of 300 000 SHU.To get the desired spiciness, how many
habanero peppers should you substitute for the jalapeño peppers
in the recipe for the 400 dinners?
58
A standard interior staircase has steps each with a rise
(height) of 19 cm and a run (horizontal depth) of 23 cm. Research
suggests that the stairs would be safer for descent if the run were,
instead, 28 cm. For a particular staircase of total height 4.57 m, how
much farther into the room would the staircase extend if this
change in run were made?
59
In purchasing food for a political rally, you erroneously order
shucked medium-size Pacific oysters (which come 8 to 12 per U.S.
pint) instead of shucked medium-size Atlantic oysters (which
come 26 to 38 per U.S. pint). The filled oyster container shipped to
you has the interior measure of 1.0 m ' 12 cm ' 20 cm, and a U.S.
pint is equivalent to 0.4732 liter. By how many oysters is the order
short of your anticipated count?

An old English cookbook carries this recipe for cream of net-
tle soup: “Boil stock of the following amount: 1 breakfastcup plus
1 teacup plus 6 tablespoons plus 1 dessertspoon. Using gloves,
separate nettle tops until you have 0.5 quart; add the tops to the
boiling stock. Add 1 tablespoon of cooked rice and 1 saltspoon of
salt. Simmer for 15 min.” The following table gives some of the
conversions among old (premetric) British measures and among
common (still premetric) U.S. measures. (These measures just
scream for metrication.) For liquid measures, 1 British teaspoon "
1 U.S. teaspoon. For dry measures, 1 British teaspoon " 2 U.S. tea-
spoons and 1 British quart " 1 U.S. quart. In U.S. measures, how
much (a) stock, (b) nettle tops, (c) rice, and (d) salt are required in
the recipe?
