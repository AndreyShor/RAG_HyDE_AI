boxed region, at distance d. Each problem in Table 34-9 refers to a
different combination of lenses and different values for distances,
which are given in centimeters. The type of lens is indicated by C
for converging and D for diverging; the number after C or D is the
distance between a lens and either of its focal points (the proper
sign of the focal distance is not indicated).
Find (a) the image distance i2 for the image produced by lens
2 (the final image produced by the system) and (b) the overall
lateral magnification M for the system, including signs. Also,
determine whether the final image is (c) real (R) or virtual (V),
(d) inverted (I) from object O or noninverted (NI), and (e) on
the same side of lens 2 as object O or on the opposite side.

If the angular magnification of an astronomical telescope is 36
and the diameter of the objective is 75 mm, what is the minimum di-
ameter of the eyepiece required to collect all the light entering the
objective from a distant point source on the telescope axis?
•89
In a microscope of the type shown in Fig. 34-20, the
focal length of the objective is 4.00 cm, and that of the eyepiece is
8.00 cm. The distance between the lenses is 25.0 cm. (a) What is
the tube length s? (b) If image I in Fig. 34-20 is to be just inside
focal point F#1, how far from the objective should the object be?
What then are (c) the lateral magnification m of the objective,
(d) the angular magnification mu of the eyepiece, and (e) the
overall magnification M of the microscope?

Figure 34-46a shows the basic structure of an old film cam-
era. A lens can be moved forward or back to produce an image on
film at the back of the camera. For a certain camera, with the dis-
tance i between the lens and the film set at f
5.0 cm, parallel light
rays from a very distant object O converge to a point image on
the film, as shown. The object is now brought closer, to a distance
of p ! 100 cm, and the lens–film distance is adjusted so that an
!

inverted real image forms on the film (Fig. 34-46b). (a) What is the
lens–film distance i now? (b) By how much was distance i
changed?

Figure 34-47a shows the basic structure of a human eye.
Light refracts into the eye through the cornea and is then further
redirected by a lens whose shape (and thus ability to focus the
light) is controlled by muscles. We can treat the cornea and eye
lens as a single effective thin lens (Fig. 34-47b).A “normal” eye can
focus parallel light rays from a distant object O to a point on the
retina at the back of the eye, where processing of the visual infor-
mation begins. As an object is brought close to the eye, however,
the muscles must change the shape of the lens so that rays form an
inverted real image on the retina (Fig. 34-47c). (a) Suppose that for
the parallel rays of Figs. 34-47a and b, the focal length f of the effec-
tive thin lens of the eye is 2.50 cm. For an object at distance p !
40.0 cm, what focal length f# of the effective lens is required for the
object to be seen clearly? (b) Must the eye muscles increase or de-
crease the radii of curvature of the eye lens to give focal length f#?

An object is 10.0 mm from the objective of a certain
compound microscope. The lenses are 300 mm apart, and the in-
termediate image is 50.0 mm from the eyepiece. What overall
magnification is produced by the instrument?
