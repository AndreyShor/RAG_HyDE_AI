●Atoms have quantized energies and can make quantum
jumps between them. If a jump between a higher energy and a
lower energy involves the emission or absorption of a photon,
the frequency associated with the light is given by
hf ! Ehigh # Elow.
●States with the same value of quantum number n form a shell.
●States with the same values of quantum numbers n and
form a subshell.
●The magnitude of the orbital angular momentum of an elec-
tron trapped in an atom has quantized values given by
for
where is 
,! is the orbital quantum number, and n is the
electron’s principal quantum number.
