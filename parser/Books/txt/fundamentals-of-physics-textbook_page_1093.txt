35-4 INTERFERENCE FROM THIN FILMS
Film Thickness Much Less Than l
A special situation arises when a film is so thin that L is much less than l, say,
L % 0.1l. Then the path length difference 2L can be neglected, and the phase
difference between r1 and r2 is due only to reflection phase shifts. If the film of
Fig. 35-17, where the reflections cause a phase difference of 0.5 wavelength,
has thickness L % 0.1l, then r1 and r2 are exactly out of phase, and thus the film
is dark, regardless of the wavelength and intensity of the light. This special situa-
tion corresponds to m ! 0 in Eq. 35-37.We shall count any thickness L % 0.1l as
being the least thickness specified by Eq. 35-37 to make the film of Fig. 35-17
dark. (Every such thickness will correspond to m ! 0.) The next greater thickness
that will make the film dark is that corresponding to m ! 1.
In Fig. 35-18, bright white light illuminates a vertical soap film whose thick-
ness increases from top to bottom. However, the top portion is so thin that it is
dark. In the (somewhat thicker) middle we see fringes, or bands, whose color de-
pends primarily on the wavelength at which reflected light undergoes fully con-
structive interference for a particular thickness.Toward the (thickest) bottom the
fringes become progressively narrower and the colors begin to overlap and fade.

soapy water film spanning a vertical loop.
The top portion is so thin (due to gravita-
tional slumping) that the light reflected
there undergoes destructive interference,
making that portion dark. Colored inter-
ference fringes, or bands, decorate the rest
of the film but are marred by circulation
of liquid within the film as the liquid is
gradually pulled downward by gravitation.
Checkpoint 5
The figure shows four
situations in which
light reflects perpen-
dicularly from a thin
film of thickness L,
with indexes of refraction as given. (a) For which situations does reflection at the film
interfaces cause a zero phase difference for the two reflected rays? (b) For which situ-
ations will the film be dark if the path length difference 2L causes a phase difference
of 0.5 wavelength?

which leads to Eq. 35-36:
Solving for l and substituting for L and n2, we find
For m ! 0, this gives us l ! 1700 nm, which is in the infrared
region. For m ! 1, we find l ! 567 nm, which is yellow-green
light, near the middle of the visible spectrum. For m ! 2, l !
340 nm, which is in the ultraviolet region. Thus, the wave-
length at which the light seen by the observer is brightest is
l ! 567 nm.

Sample Problem 35.05
Thin-film interference of a water film in air
White light, with a uniform intensity across the visible wave-
length range of 400 to 690 nm, is perpendicularly incident on
a water film, of index of refraction n2 ! 1.33 and thickness 
L ! 320 nm, that is suspended in air.At what wavelength l is
the light reflected by the film brightest to an observer?
KEY IDEA
The reflected light from the film is brightest at the wave-
lengths l for which the reflected rays are in phase with one
another. The equation relating these wavelengths l to the
given film thickness L and film index of refraction n2 is
either Eq. 35-36 or Eq. 35-37, depending on the reflection
phase shifts for this particular film.
Calculations: To determine which equation is needed, we
should fill out an organizing table like Table 35-1. However,
because there is air on both sides of the water film, the situa-
tion here is exactly like that in Fig. 35-17, and thus the table
would be exactly like Table 35-1. Then from Table 35-1, we
