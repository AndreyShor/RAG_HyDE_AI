CHAPTER 31
ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS AND ALTERNATING CURRENT
To determine the charge q on the capacitor as a function of time, we can put
in a voltmeter to measure the time-varying potential difference (or voltage) vC
that exists across the capacitor C. From Eq. 25-1 we can write
which allows us to find q. To measure the current, we can connect a small resis-
tance R in series with the capacitor and inductor and measure the time-varying
potential difference vR across it; vR is proportional to i through the relation
vR ! iR.
We assume here that R is so small that its effect on the behavior of the circuit is
negligible. The variations in time of vC and vR, and thus of q and i, are shown in
Fig. 31-2.All four quantities vary sinusoidally.
In an actual LC circuit, the oscillations will not continue indefinitely because
there is always some resistance present that will drain energy from the elec-
tric and magnetic fields and dissipate it as thermal energy (the circuit may
become warmer). The oscillations, once started, will die away as Fig. 31-3 sug-
gests. Compare this figure with Fig. 15-17, which shows the decay of mechanical
oscillations caused by frictional damping in a block–spring system.

A charged capacitor and an inductor are connected in series at time t ! 0. In terms
of the period T of the resulting oscillations, determine how much later the following
reach their maximum value: (a) the charge on the capacitor; (b) the voltage across
the capacitor, with its original polarity; (c) the energy stored in the electric field; and
(d) the current.
The Electrical–Mechanical Analogy
Let us look a little closer at the analogy between the oscillating LC system of
Fig. 31-1 and an oscillating block–spring system. Two kinds of energy are
involved in the block–spring system. One is potential energy of the compressed
or extended spring; the other is kinetic energy of the moving block. These two
energies are given by the formulas in the first energy column in Table 31-1.
