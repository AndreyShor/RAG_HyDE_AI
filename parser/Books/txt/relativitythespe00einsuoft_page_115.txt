EXACT   FORMULATION   OF   THE   GENERAL 
PRINCIPLE  OF  RELATIVITY 
WE  are  now  in  a  position  to  replace  the  pro 
visional  formulation  of  the  general  principle 
of  relativity  given  in  Section  XVIII  by 
an  exact  formulation.  The  form  there  used,  "All 
bodies  of  reference  K,  K' ,  etc.,  are  equivalent  for 
the  description  of  natural  phenomena  (formulation  of 
the  general  laws  of  nature),  whatever  may  be  their 
state  of  motion,"  cannot  be  maintained,  because  the 
use  of  rigid  reference-bodies,  in  the  sense  of  the  method 
followed  in  the  special  theory  of  relativity,  is  in  gereral 
not  possible  in  space-time  description.  The  Gauss 
co-ordinate  system  has  to  take  the  place  of  the  body  of 
reference.  The  following  statement  corresponds  to  the 
fundamental  idea  of  the  general  principle  of  relativity  : 
"  All  Gaussian  co-ordinate  systems  are  essentially  equi 
valent  for  the  formulation  of  the  general  laws  of  nature." 
We  can  state  this  general  principle  of  relativity  in  still 
another  form,  which  renders  it  yet  more  clearly  in 
telligible  than  it  is  when  in  the  form  of  the  natural 
extension  of  the  special  principle  of  relativity.  Accord 
ing  to  the  special  theory  of  relativity,  the  equations 
which  express  the  general  laws  of  nature  pass  over  into 
equations  of  the  same  form  when,  by  making  use  of  the 
Lorentz  transformation,  we  replace  the  space-time
