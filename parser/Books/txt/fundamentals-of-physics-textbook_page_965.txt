“black box” through a pair of termi-
nals. The box contains an RLC cir-
cuit, possibly even a multiloop cir-

A generator supplies 100 V to a transformer’s primary coil,
which has 50 turns. If the secondary coil has 500 turns, what is the
secondary voltage?

A transformer has 500 primary turns and 10 sec-
ondary turns. (a) If Vp is 120 V (rms), what is Vs with an open
circuit? If the secondary now has a resistive
load of 15 ", what is the current in the (b)
primary and (c) secondary?

Figure 31-37 shows an “autotrans-
former.” It consists of a single coil (with an
iron core). Three taps Ti are provided.
Between taps T1 and T2 there are 200 turns,
and between taps T2 and T3 there are 800
turns.Any two taps can be chosen as the pri-
mary terminals, and any two taps can be
chosen as the secondary terminals. For

••65
An ac generator provides emf to a resistive load in a remote
factory over a two-cable transmission line. At the factory a step-
down transformer reduces the voltage from its (rms) transmission
value Vt to a much lower value that is safe and convenient for use
in the factory. The transmission line resistance is 0.30 "/cable, and
the power of the generator is 250 kW. If Vt ! 80 kV, what are
(a) the voltage decrease )V along the transmission line and (b) the
rate Pd at which energy is dissipated in the line as thermal energy?
If Vt ! 8.0 kV, what are (c) )V and (d) Pd? If Vt ! 0.80 kV, what
are (e) )V and (f) Pd?

In Fig. 31-35, let the rectangular box on the left represent the
(high-impedance) output of an audio amplifier, with r ! 1000 ".
Let R ! 10 " represent the (low-impedance) coil of a loud-
speaker. For maximum transfer of energy to the load R we must
have R ! r, and that is not true in this case. However, a trans-
former can be used to “transform” resistances, making them be-
have electrically as if they were larger or smaller than they actu-
ally are. (a) Sketch the primary and secondary coils of a
transformer that can be introduced between the amplifier and
the speaker in Fig. 31-35 to match the impedances. (b) What must
