FORCE AND MOTION—II
Checkpoint 1
A block lies on a floor. (a) What is the magnitude of the frictional force on it from the
floor? (b) If a horizontal force of 5 N is now applied to the block, but the block does
not move, what is the magnitude of the frictional force on it? (c) If the maximum
value fs,max of the static frictional force on the block is 10 N, will the block move if the
magnitude of the horizontally applied force is 8 N? (d) If it is 12 N? (e) What is the
magnitude of the frictional force in part (c)?
ond law as
FN $ mg $ F sin u " m(0),
(6-4)
which gives us
FN " mg # F sin u.
(6-5)
Now we can evaluate fs,max" msFN:
fs,max " ms(mg # F sin u)
" (0.700)((8.00 kg)(9.8 m/s2) # (12.0 N)(sin 303))
" 59.08 N.
(6-6)
Because the magnitude Fx (" 10.39 N) of the force com-
ponent attempting to slide the block is less than fs,max
(" 59.08 N), the block remains stationary.That means that
the magnitude fs of the frictional force matches Fx. From
Fig. 6-3d, we can write Newton’s second law for x compo-
nents as
Fx $ fs " m(0),
(6-7)
and thus
fs " Fx " 10.39 N
10.4 N.

Sample Problem 6.01
Angled force applied to an initially stationary block
This sample problem involves a tilted applied force,
which requires that we work with components to find a
frictional force. The main challenge is to sort out all the
components. Figure 6-3a shows a force of magnitude F "
12.0 N applied to an 8.00 kg block at a downward angle of 
u " 30.03. The coefficient of static friction between block
and floor is ms " 0.700; the coefficient of kinetic friction is
mk " 0.400. Does the block begin to slide or does it re-
main stationary? What is the magnitude of the frictional
force on the block?
KEY IDEAS
(1) When the object is stationary on a surface, the static fric-
tional force balances the force component that is attempting
to slide the object along the surface. (2) The maximum possi-
ble magnitude of that force is given by Eq. 6-1 ( fs,max" msFN).
(3) If the component of the applied force along the surface
exceeds this limit on the static friction, the block begins to
slide. (4) If the object slides, the kinetic frictional force is
given by Eq.6-2 ( fk" mkFN).
Calculations: To see if the block slides (and thus to calcu-
late the magnitude of the frictional force), we must com-
pare the applied force component Fx with the maximum
magnitude fs,max that the static friction can have. From the
triangle of components and full force shown in Fig. 6-3b,
we see that
Fx " F cos u
" (12.0 N) cos 303 " 10.39 N.
(6-3)
From Eq. 6-1, we know that fs,max " msFN, but we need the
magnitude FN of the normal force to evaluate fs,max. Because
the normal force is vertical, we need to write Newton’s sec-
ond law (Fnet,y " may) for the vertical force components act-
ing on the block, as displayed in Fig. 6-3c. The gravitational
force with magnitude mg acts downward. The applied force
has a downward component Fy " F sin u. And the vertical
acceleration ay is just zero.Thus, we can write Newton’s sec-
