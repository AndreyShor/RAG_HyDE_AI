there? The thermal conductivity of ice is 0.400 W/m9K, and the
density of liquid water is 1000 kg/m3.

A sample of gas expands from an initial pressure and
volume of 10 Pa and 1.0 m3 to a final volume of 2.0 m3. During the
expansion, the pressure and volume are related by the equation 
p # aV 2, where a # 10 N/m8. Determine the work done by the gas
during this expansion.

Figure 18-56a shows a cylinder containing gas and closed by a
movable piston.The cylinder is kept submerged in an ice–water mix-
ture.The piston is quickly pushed down from position 1 to position 2
and then held at position 2 until the gas is again at the temperature of
the ice–water mixture; it then is slowly raised back to position 1.
Figure 18-56b is a p-V diagram for the process. If 100 g of ice is
melted during the cycle, how much work has been done on the gas?

time scale is set by ts#20 min.What is the specific heat of the sample?

The average rate at which energy is conducted outward
through the ground surface in North America is 54.0 mW/m2, and
the average thermal conductivity of the near-surface rocks is 2.50
W/m9K. Assuming a surface temperature of 10.0 C, find the tem-
perature at a depth of 35.0 km (near the base of the crust). Ignore
the heat generated by the presence of radioactive elements.

What is the volume increase of an aluminum cube 5.00 cm on
an edge when heated from 10.0 C to 60.0 C?

In a series of experiments,
block B is to be placed in a ther-
mally 
insulated 
container 
with
block A, which has the same mass as
block B. In each experiment, block
B is initially at a certain tempera-
ture TB, but temperature TA of
block A is changed from experi-
ment to experiment. Let Tf repre-
sent the final temperature of the
two blocks when they reach thermal
equilibrium in any of the experi-
ments. Figure 18-53 gives temperature Tf versus the initial tem-
perature TA for a range of possible values of TA, from TA1 # 0 K
to TA2 # 500 K. The vertical axis scale is set by Tfs # 400 K. What
are (a) temperature TB and (b) the ratio cB/cA of the specific
heats of the blocks?

Figure 18-54 displays a closed
cycle for a gas. From c to b, 40 J is
transferred from the gas as heat.
From b to a, 130 J is transferred
from the gas as heat, and the mag-
nitude of the work done by the gas
is 80 J. From a to c, 400 J is trans-
ferred to the gas as heat. What is
the work done by the gas from a to
c? (Hint: You need to supply the
plus and minus signs for the given data.)

Three equal-length straight rods, of aluminum, Invar, and
steel, all at 20.0 C, form an equilateral triangle with hinge pins at
the vertices.At what temperature will the angle opposite the Invar
rod be 59.95 ? See Appendix E for needed trigonometric formulas
and Table 18-2 for needed data.

sides of the icicle or down through the tip because there is no tem-
perature change in those directions. It can lose energy and freeze
only by sending energy up (through distance L) to the top of the
icicle, where the temperature Tr can be below 0 C.Take L # 0.12 m
and Tr # $5 C. Assume that the central tube and the upward con-
duction path both have cross-sectional area A. In terms of A, what
rate is (a) energy conducted upward and (b) mass converted from
liquid to ice at the top of the central tube? (c) At what rate does
the top of the tube move downward because of water freezing

A sample of gas under-
goes a transition from an initial state
a to a final state b by three different
paths (processes), as shown in the p-
V diagram in Fig. 18-57, where Vb #
5.00Vi. The energy transferred to
the gas as heat in process 1 is 10piVi.
In terms of piVi, what are (a) the en-
ergy transferred to the gas as heat in
process 2 and (b) the change in in-
ternal energy that the gas undergoes
in process 3?

A copper rod, an aluminum rod, and a brass rod, each of
6.00 m length and 1.00 cm diameter, are placed end to end with the
aluminum rod between the other two. The free end of the copper
rod is maintained at water’s boiling point, and the free end of the
brass rod is maintained at water’s freezing point. What is the
steady-state temperature of (a) the copper–aluminum junction
and (b) the aluminum–brass junction?

The temperature of a Pyrex disk is changed from 10.0 C
to 60.0 C. Its initial radius is 8.00 cm; its initial thickness is
0.500 cm.Take these data as being exact.What is the change in the
volume of the disk? (See Table 18-2.)
