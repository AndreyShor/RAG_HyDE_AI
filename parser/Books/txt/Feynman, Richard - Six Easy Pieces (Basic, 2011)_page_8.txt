PUBLISHER’S NOTE
Six Easy Pieces grew out of the need to bring to as wide an audience
as possible a substantial yet nontechnical physics primer based on
the science of Richard Feynman. We have chosen the six easiest
chapters from Feynman’s celebrated and landmark text, The Feyn-
man Lectures on Physics (originally published in 1963), which re-
mains his most famous publication. General readers are fortunate
that Feynman chose to present certain key topics in largely quali-
tative terms without formal mathematics, and these are brought to-
gether for Six Easy Pieces.
We would like to thank Paul Davies for his insightful introduc-
tion to this newly formed collection. Following his introduction
we have chosen to reproduce two prefaces from The Feynman Lec-
tures on Physics, one by Feynman himself and one by two of his col-
leagues, because they provide context for the pieces that follow and
insight into both Richard Feynman and his science.
Finally, we would like to thank the California Institute of Tech-
nology’s Physics Department and Institute Archives, in particular
Dr. Judith Goodstein, and Dr. Brian Hatﬁeld, for his outstanding
advice and recommendations throughout the development of this
project.
