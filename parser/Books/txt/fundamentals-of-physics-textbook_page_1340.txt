CHAPTER 43
ENERGY FROM THE NUCLEUS
Bohr and Wheeler were able to answer this question. Figure 43-3 shows a
graph of the potential energy of the fissioning nucleus at various stages, derived
from their model for the fission process.This energy is plotted against the distor-
tion parameter r, which is a rough measure of the extent to which the oscillating
nucleus departs from a spherical shape.When the fragments are far apart, this pa-
rameter is simply the distance between their centers (Fig. 43-2e).
The energy difference between the initial state (r ! 0) and the final state 
(r ! ,) of the fissioning nucleus—that is, the disintegration energy Q—is
labeled in Fig. 43-3. The central feature of that figure, however, is that the poten-
tial energy curve passes through a maximum at a certain value of r.Thus, there is
a potential barrier of height Eb that must be surmounted (or tunneled through)
before fission can occur.This reminds us of alpha decay (Fig. 42-10), which is also
a process that is inhibited by a potential barrier.
We see then that fission will occur only if the absorbed neutron provides
an excitation energy En great enough to overcome the barrier. This energy En
need not be quite as great as the barrier height Eb because of the possibility of
quantum-physics tunneling.
Table 43-2 shows, for four high-mass nuclides, this test of whether capture
of a thermal neutron can cause fissioning. For each nuclide, the table shows
both the barrier height Eb of the nucleus that is formed by the neutron capture
and the excitation energy En due to the capture. The values of Eb are calculated
from the theory of Bohr and Wheeler. The values of En are calculated from the
change in mass energy due to the neutron capture.
For an example of the calculation of En, we can go to the first line in the
table, which represents the neutron capture process
The masses involved are 235.043 922 u for 235U, 1.008 665 u for the neutron,
and 236.045 562 u for 236U. It is easy to show that, because of the neutron
capture,the mass decreases by 7.025 " 10#3 u.Thus,energy is transferred from mass
energy to excitation energy En. Multiplying the change in mass by c2 (! 931.494 013
MeV/u) gives us En ! 6.5 MeV,which is listed on the first line of the table.
The first and third results in Table 43-2 are historically profound because they
are the reasons the two atomic bombs used in World War II contained 235U (first
bomb) and 239Pu (second bomb).That is,for 235U and 239Pu,En . Eb.This means that
fission by absorption of a thermal neutron is predicted to occur for these nuclides.
For the other two nuclides in Table 43-2 (238U and 243Am), we have En / Eb; thus,
235U ' n : 236U.
