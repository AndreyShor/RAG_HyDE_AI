Figure 15-8 (a) Potential energy U(t), kinet-
ic energy K(t), and mechanical energy E
as functions of time t for a linear harmon-
ic oscillator. Note that all energies are
positive and that the potential energy and
the kinetic energy peak twice during
every period. (b) Potential energy U(x),
kinetic energy K(x), and mechanical energy
E as functions of position x for a linear 
harmonic oscillator with amplitude xm.
For x ! 0 the energy is all kinetic, and for 
x ! 7xm it is all potential.

Checkpoint 4
In Fig. 15-7, the block has a kinetic energy of 3 J and the spring has an elastic potential
energy of 2 J when the block is at x ! #2.0 cm. (a) What is the kinetic energy when
the block is at x ! 0? What is the elastic potential energy when the block is at (b)
x ! %2.0 cm and (c) x ! %xm?
(a) What is the total mechanical energy E of the spring–
block system?
KEY IDEA
The mechanical energy E (the sum of the kinetic energy
of the block and the potential energy 
of
the spring) is constant throughout the motion of the oscillator.
Thus, we can evaluate E at any point during the motion.
Calculations: Because we are given amplitude xm of the os-
cillations,let’s evaluate E when the block is at position x ! xm,

Sample Problem 15.03
SHM potential energy, kinetic energy, mass dampers
Many tall buildings have mass dampers, which are anti-sway
devices to prevent them from oscillating in a wind. The de-
vice might be a block oscillating at the end of a spring and
on a lubricated track. If the building sways, say, eastward,
the block also moves eastward but delayed enough so that
when it finally moves, the building is then moving back
westward. Thus, the motion of the oscillator is out of step
with the motion of the building.
Suppose the block has mass m ! 2.72 $ 105 kg and is de-
signed to oscillate at frequency f ! 10.0 Hz and with ampli-
tude xm ! 20.0 cm.
potential energy of a linear oscillator like that of Fig. 15-7 is associated entirely
with the spring. Its value depends on how much the spring is stretched or com-
pressed—that is, on x(t).We can use Eqs. 8-11 and 15-3 to find
(15-18)
Caution: A function written in the form cos2 A (as here) means (cos A)2 and is not
the same as one written cos A2, which means cos(A2).
The kinetic energy of the system of Fig. 15-7 is associated entirely with the
block. Its value depends on how fast the block is moving—that is, on v(t). We can
use Eq.15-6 to find
(15-19)
If we use Eq. 15-12 to substitute k/m for v2, we can write Eq. 15-19 as
(15-20)
The mechanical energy follows from Eqs. 15-18 and 15-20 and is
E ! U # K
For any angle a,
cos2 a # sin2 a ! 1.
Thus, the quantity in the square brackets above is unity and we have
(15-21)
The mechanical energy of a linear oscillator is indeed constant and independent of
time. The potential energy and kinetic energy of a linear oscillator are shown as
functions of time t in Fig. 15-8a and as functions of displacement x in Fig. 15-8b. In
any oscillating system, an element of springiness is needed to store the potential en-
ergy and an element of inertia is needed to store the kinetic energy.
