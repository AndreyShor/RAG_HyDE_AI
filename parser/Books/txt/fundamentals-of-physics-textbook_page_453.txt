15-4 PENDULUMS, CIRCULAR MOTION
Corresponding to any physical pendulum that oscillates about a given pivot
point O with period T is a simple pendulum of length L0 with the same period T.
We can find L0 with Eq. 15-28.The point along the physical pendulum at distance
L0 from point O is called the center of oscillation of the physical pendulum for the
given suspension point.
Measuring g
We can use a physical pendulum to measure the free-fall acceleration g at a par-
ticular location on Earth’s surface. (Countless thousands of such measurements
have been made during geophysical prospecting.)
To analyze a simple case, take the pendulum to be a uniform rod of length L,
suspended from one end. For such a pendulum, h in Eq. 15-29, the distance
between the pivot point and the center of mass, is L.Table 10-2e tells us that the
rotational inertia of this pendulum about a perpendicular axis through its center
of mass is 
mL2. From the parallel-axis theorem of Eq. 10-36 (I ! Icom # Mh2),
we then find that the rotational inertia about a perpendicular axis through one
end of the rod is
I ! Icom # mh2 !
mL2 # m( L)2 ! mL2.
(15-30)
If we put h ! L and I ! mL2 in Eq. 15-29 and solve for g, we find
.
(15-31)
Thus, by measuring L and the period T, we can find the value of g at the pendu-
lum’s location. (If precise measurements are to be made, a number of refine-
ments are needed, such as swinging the pendulum in an evacuated chamber.)

Three physical pendulums, of masses m0, 2m0, and 3m0, have the same shape and size
and are suspended at the same point. Rank the masses according to the periods of the
pendulums, greatest first.
Sample Problem 15.05
Physical pendulum, period and length
In Fig. 15-13a, a meter stick swings about a pivot point at
one end, at distance h from the stick’s center of mass.
(a) What is the period of oscillation T?
KEY IDEA
The stick is not a simple pendulum because its mass is not
concentrated in a bob at the end opposite the pivot point—
so the stick is a physical pendulum.
Calculations: The period for a physical pendulum is
given by Eq. 15-29, for which we need the rotational 
inertia I of the stick about the pivot point. We can treat
the stick as a uniform rod of length L and mass m. Then
Eq. 15-30 tells us that I ! mL2, and the distance h in
