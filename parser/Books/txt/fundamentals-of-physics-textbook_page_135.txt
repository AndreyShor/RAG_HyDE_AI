5-3 APPLYING NEWTON’S LAWS
to draw the x axis parallel to the table, in the direction in
which the block moves.
Q
Thanks, but you still haven’t told me how to apply
to the sliding block.All you’ve done is explain
how to draw a free-body diagram.
You are right, and here’s the third key idea: The
expression 
is a vector equation, so we can write
it as three component equations:
Fnet,x " Max
Fnet,y " May
Fnet,z " Maz
(5-16)
in which Fnet,x, Fnet,y, and Fnet,z are the components of the net
force along the three axes. Now we apply each component
equation to its corresponding direction. Because block S
does not accelerate vertically, Fnet, y " May becomes
FN $ FgS " 0
or
FN " FgS.
(5-17)
Thus in the y direction, the magnitude of the normal force is
equal to the magnitude of the gravitational force.
No force acts in the z direction, which is perpendicular
to the page.
In the x direction, there is only one force component,
which is T.Thus, Fnet, x " Max becomes
T " Ma.
(5-18)
This equation contains two unknowns, T and a; so we cannot
yet solve it. Recall, however, that we have not said anything
about the hanging block.
Q
I agree. How do I apply 
to the hanging block?
We apply it just as we did for block S: Draw a free-body
diagram for block H,as in Fig.5-14b.Then apply 
in
component form.This time, because the acceleration is along
the y axis, we use the y part of Eq. 5-16 (Fnet, y " may) to write
T $ FgH " may.
(5-19)
We can now substitute mg for FgH and $a for ay (negative

because block H accelerates in the negative direction of the
y axis).We find
T $ mg " $ma.
(5-20)
Now note that Eqs. 5-18 and 5-20 are simultaneous equa-
tions with the same two unknowns, T and a. Subtracting
these equations eliminates T.Then solving for a yields
(5-21)
Substituting this result into Eq. 5-18 yields
(5-22)
Putting in the numbers gives, for these two quantities,

Q
The problem is now solved, right?
That’s a fair question, but the problem is not really fin-
ished until we have examined the results to see whether
they make sense. (If you made these calculations on the job,
wouldn’t you want to see whether they made sense before
you turned them in?)
Look first at Eq. 5-21. Note that it is dimensionally
correct and that the acceleration a will always be less than g
(because of the cord, the hanging block is not in free fall).
Look now at Eq. 5-22, which we can rewrite in the form
(5-23)
In this form, it is easier to see that this equation is also
dimensionally correct, because both T and mg have dimen-
sions of forces. Equation 5-23 also lets us see that the ten-
sion in the cord is always less than mg, and thus is always
less than the gravitational force on the hanging block.That is
a comforting thought because, if T were greater than mg,
the hanging block would accelerate upward.
We can also check the results by studying special cases,
in which we can guess what the answers must be. A simple
example is to put g " 0, as if the experiment were carried out
in interstellar space. We know that in that case, the blocks
would not move from rest, there would be no forces on the
ends of the cord, and so there would be no tension in the
cord. Do the formulas predict this? Yes, they do. If you put
g " 0 in Eqs. 5-21 and 5-22, you find a " 0 and T " 0. Two
more special cases you might try are M " 0 and
