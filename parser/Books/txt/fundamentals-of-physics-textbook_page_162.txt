The toward-the-
center force is
the frictional force.
Friction: toward the

Normal force:
helps support car
Gravitational force:
pulls car downward
Negative lift: presses
car downward

Radial calculations: The frictional force 
is shown in the
free-body diagram of Fig. 6-10b. It is in the negative direc-
tion of a radial axis r that always extends from the center of
curvature through the car as the car moves. The force pro-
duces a centripetal acceleration of magnitude v2/R. We can
relate the force and acceleration by writing Newton’s sec-
ond law for components along the r axis (Fnet,r " mar) as
(6-20)
Substituting fs,max " msFN for fs leads us to
(6-21)
Vertical calculations: Next, let’s consider the vertical forces
on the car. The normal force 
is directed up, in the posi-
tive direction of the y axis in Fig. 6-10b. The gravitational
force 
and the negative lift 
are directed down.
The acceleration of the car along the y axis is zero. Thus we
can write Newton’s second law for components along the
y axis (Fnet,y " may) as
FN $ mg $ FL " 0,
or
FN " mg # FL.
(6-22)
Combining results: Now we can combine our results along
the two axes by substituting Eq.6-22 for FN in Eq.6-21.Doing
so and then solving for FL lead to

Sample Problem 6.05
Car in flat circular turn
Upside-down racing: A modern race car is designed so that
the passing air pushes down on it, allowing the car to travel
much faster through a flat turn in a Grand Prix without fric-
tion failing. This downward push is called negative lift. Can a
race car have so much negative lift that it could be driven up-
side down on a long ceiling, as done fictionally by a sedan in
the first Men in Black movie?
Figure 6-10a represents a Grand Prix race car of mass 
m " 600 kg as it travels on a flat track in a circular arc of
radius R " 100 m. Because of the shape of the car and the
wings on it, the passing air exerts a negative lift 
down-
ward on the car. The coefficient of static friction between
the tires and the track is 0.75. (Assume that the forces on the
four tires are identical.)
(a) If the car is on the verge of sliding out of the turn when
its speed is 28.6 m/s, what is the magnitude of the negative
lift 
acting downward on the car?
KEY IDEAS
1.
A centripetal force must act on the car because the car
is moving around a circular arc; that force must be
directed toward the center of curvature of the arc (here,
that is horizontally).
2.
The only horizontal force acting on the car is a frictional
force on the tires from the road. So the required cen-
tripetal force is a frictional force.
3.
Because the car is not sliding, the frictional force must
be a static frictional force 
(Fig. 6-10a).
4.
Because the car is on the verge of sliding, the magnitude
fs is equal to the maximum value fs,max " msFN, where FN
is the magnitude of the normal force 
acting on the
car from the track.
