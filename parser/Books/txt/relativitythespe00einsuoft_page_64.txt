46     SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
independent  of  each  other.  By  means  of  the  theory  of  j
relativity  they  have  been  united  into  one  law.  We  shall 
now  briefly  consider  how  this  unification  came  about, 
and  what  meaning  is  to  be  attached  to  it. 
The  principle  of  relativity  requires  that  the  law  of  the  j
conservation  of  energy  should  hold  not  only  with  re 
ference  to  a  co-ordinate  system  K,  but  also  with  respect 
to  every  co-ordinate  system  K'  which  is  in  a  state  of 
uniform  motion  of  translation  relative  to  K,  or,  briefly, 
relative  to  every  "  Galileian  "  system  of  co-ordinates. 
In  contrast  to  classical  mechanics,  the  Lorentz  trans 
formation  is  the  deciding  factor  in  the  transition  from 
one  such  system  to  another. 
By  means  of  comparatively  simple  considerations 
we  are  led  to  draw  the  following  conclusion  from 
these  premises,  in  conjunction  with  the  fundamental 
equations  of  the  electrodynamics  of  Maxwell :  A  body 
moving  with  the  velocity  v,  which  absorbs 1  an  amount 
of  energy  E0  in  the  form  of  radiation  without  suffering 
an  alteration  in  velocity  in  the  process,  has,  as  a  conse 
quence,  its  energy  increased  by  an  amount 
!? 
In  consideration  of  the  expression  given  above  for  the 
kinetic  energy  of  the  body,  the  required  energy  of  the 
body  comes  out  to  be 
1  E0  is  the  energy  taken  up,  as  judged  from  a  co-ordinate 
system  moving  with  the  body.
