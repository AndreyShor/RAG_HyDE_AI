7-3 WORK DONE BY THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE
Calculations: We relate the speed to the work done by
combining Eqs. 7-10 (the work–kinetic energy theorem) and
7-1 (the definition of kinetic energy):
The initial speed vi is zero, and we now know that the work

Sample Problem 7.03
Work done by a constant force in unit-vector notation
During a storm, a crate of crepe is sliding across a slick,
oily parking lot through a displacement 
while a steady wind pushes against the crate with a force
. The situation and coordinate
axes are shown in Fig. 7-5.
(a) How much work does this force do on the crate during
the displacement?
KEY IDEA
Because we can treat the crate as a particle and because the
wind force is constant (“steady”) in both magnitude and direc-
tion during the displacement, we can use either Eq. 7-7 (W "
Fd cos f) or Eq. 7-8 
to calculate the work. Since
we know 
and 
in unit-vector notation, we choose Eq. 7-8.
Calculations: We write
Of the possible unit-vector dot products, only iˆ"iˆ, ˆj"ˆj, and
ˆk"ˆk are nonzero (see Appendix E). Here we obtain
W " (2.0 N)($3.0 m)iˆ"iˆ # ($6.0 N)($3.0 m)ˆj"iˆ

The parallel force component does
negative work, slowing the crate.
Thus,the force does a negative 6.0 J of work on the crate,trans-
ferring 6.0 J of energy from the kinetic energy of the crate.
(b) If the crate has a kinetic energy of 10 J at the beginning
of displacement , what is its kinetic energy at the end of ?
KEY IDEA
Because the force does negative work on the crate, it re-
duces the crate’s kinetic energy.
Calculation: Using the work–kinetic energy theorem in
the form of Eq. 7-11, we have
Kf " Ki # W " 10 J # ($6.0 J) " 4.0 J.
(Answer)
Less kinetic energy means that the crate has been slowed.

7-3 WORK DONE BY THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE
Learning Objectives
7.08 Apply the work–kinetic energy theorem to situations
where an object is lifted or lowered.
●The work Wg done by the gravitational force 
on a
particle-like object of mass m as the object moves through a
displacement 
is given by
Wg " mgd cos f,
in which f is the angle between 
and .
●The work Wa done by an applied force as a particle-like
object is either lifted or lowered is related to the work Wg

If Kf " Ki, then the equation reduces to
Wa " $Wg,
which tells us that the applied force transfers as much energy
to the object as the gravitational force transfers from it.
