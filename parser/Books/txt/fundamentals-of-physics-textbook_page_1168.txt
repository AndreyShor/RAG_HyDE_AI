(Answer)
(b) What is the magnitude p of the electron’s momentum, in
the unit MeV/c? (Note that c is the symbol for the speed of
light and not itself a unit.)
KEY IDEA
We can find p from the total energy E and the mass energy mc2
via Eq.37-55,
E 2 ! (pc)2 ' (mc2)2.
Calculations: Solving for pc gives us
Finally, dividing both sides by c we find
p ! 3.00 MeV/c.
(Answer)
! 2(3.04 MeV)2 & (0.511 MeV)2 ! 3.00 MeV.

Sample Problem 37.06
Energy and momentum of a relativistic electron
(a) What is the total energy E of a 2.53 MeV electron?
KEY IDEA
From Eq. 37-47, the total energy E is the sum of the electron’s
mass energy (or rest energy) mc2 and its kinetic energy:
E ! mc2 ' K.
(37-57)
Calculations: The adjective “2.53 MeV” in the problem
statement means that the electron’s kinetic energy is 2.53
MeV.To evaluate the electron’s mass energy mc2, we substi-
tute the electron’s mass m from Appendix B, obtaining
Then dividing this result by 1.602 ( 10&13 J/MeV gives us
0.511 MeV as the electron’s mass energy (confirming the
value in Table 37-3). Equation 37-57 then yields

Eq. 37-8 for 1 & b.To begin we write
where we have used the fact that b is so close to unity that 
1 ' b is very close to 2.(We can round off the sum of two very
close numbers but not their difference.) The velocity we seek
is contained in the 1 & b term.Solving for 1 & b then yields
Thus,

(Answer)
(b) Suppose that the proton travels along a diameter of the
Milky Way galaxy (9.8 ( 104 ly). Approximately how long
does the proton take to travel that diameter as measured
from the common reference frame of Earth and the Galaxy?
Reasoning: We just saw that this ultrarelativistic proton is
traveling at a speed barely less than c. By the definition of
light-year,light takes 1 y to travel a distance of 1 ly,and so light
should take 9.8 ( 104 y to travel 9.8 ( 104 ly, and this proton
should take almost the same time. Thus,
from our
Earth–Milky Way reference frame,the proton’s trip takes
2t ! 9.8 ( 104 y.

Sample Problem 37.07
Energy and an astounding discrepancy in travel time
The most energetic proton ever detected in the cosmic rays
coming to Earth from space had an astounding kinetic 
energy of 3.0 ( 1020 eV (enough energy to warm a teaspoon
of water by a few degrees).
(a) What were the proton’s Lorentz factor g and speed v
(both relative to the ground-based detector)?
KEY IDEAS
(1) The proton’s Lorentz factor g relates its total energy E
to its mass energy mc2 via Eq. 37-48 (E ! gmc2). (2) The
proton’s total energy is the sum of its mass energy mc2 and
its (given) kinetic energy K.
Calculations: Putting these ideas together we have
(37-58)
From Table 37-3, the proton’s mass energy mc2 is 938 MeV.
Substituting this and the given kinetic energy into Eq. 37-58,
we obtain
(Answer)
This computed value for g is so large that we cannot use
the definition of g (Eq. 37-8) to find v.Try it; your calculator
will tell you that b is effectively equal to 1 and thus that v is
effectively equal to c. Actually, v is almost c, but we want
a more accurate answer, which we can obtain by first solving
