10-1 ROTATIONAL VARIABLES
t ! %3.0 s to t ! 6.0 s. Sketch the disk and indicate the direc-
tion of turning and the sign of v at t ! %2.0 s,4.0 s,and tmin.
KEY IDEA
From Eq. 10-6, the angular velocity v is equal to du/dt as
given in Eq. 10-10. So, we have
v ! %0.600 & 0.500t.
(10-11)
The graph of this function v(t) is shown in Fig. 10-5c.
Because the function is linear, the plot is a straight line. The
slope is 0.500 rad/s2 and the intercept with the vertical axis
(not shown) is %0.600 rad/s.
Calculations: To sketch the disk at t ! %2.0 s, we substitute
that value into Eq. 10-11, obtaining
v ! %1.6 rad/s.
(Answer)
The minus sign here tells us that at t ! %2.0 s, the disk is
turning clockwise (as indicated by the left-hand  sketch in
Fig. 10-5c).
Substituting t ! 4.0 s into Eq. 10-11 gives us
v ! 1.4 rad/s.
(Answer)
The implied plus sign tells us that now the disk is turning
counterclockwise (the right-hand sketch in Fig. 10-5c).
For tmin, we already know that du/dt ! 0. So, we must
also have v ! 0. That is, the disk momentarily stops when
the reference line reaches the minimum value of u in
Fig. 10-5b, as suggested by the center sketch in Fig. 10-5c. On
the graph of v versus t in Fig. 10-5c, this momentary stop is
the zero point where the plot changes from the negative
clockwise motion to the positive counterclockwise motion.
(d) Use the results in parts (a) through (c) to describe the
motion of the disk from t ! %3.0 s to t ! 6.0 s.
Description: When we first observe the disk at t ! %3.0 s, it
has a positive angular position and is turning clockwise but
slowing. It stops at angular position u ! %1.36 rad and then
begins to turn counterclockwise, with its angular position
eventually becoming positive again.
KEY IDEA
To find the extreme value (here the minimum) of a function,
we take the first derivative of the function and set the result
to zero.
Calculations: The first derivative of u(t) is
(10-10)
Setting this to zero and solving for t give us the time at
which u(t) is minimum:
tmin ! 1.20 s.
(Answer)
To get the minimum value of u, we next substitute tmin into
Eq. 10-9, finding
u ! %1.36 rad % %77.9#.
(Answer)
This minimum of u(t) (the bottom of the curve in Fig. 10-5b)
corresponds to the maximum clockwise rotation of the disk
from the zero angular position, somewhat more than is
shown in sketch 3.
(c) Graph the angular velocity v of the disk versus time from 
du
dt ! %0.600 & 0.500t.

This is a plot of the angular
velocity of the disk versus time.
The angular velocity is
initially negative and slowing,
then momentarily zero during
reversal, and then positive and
increasing.
