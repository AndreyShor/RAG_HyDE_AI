This relation is written in vector notation as
(4-46)
We need to resolve the vectors into components on the co-
ordinate system of Fig. 4-20b and then solve Eq. 4-46 axis by
axis. For the y components, we find
vPG,y " vPW,y # vWG,y
or
0 " $(215 km/h) sin u # (65.0 km/h)(cos 20.0°).
Solving for u gives us
(Answer)
Similarly, for the x components we find
vPG,x " vPW,x # vWG,x.
Here, because 
is parallel to the x axis, the component
vPG,x is equal to the magnitude vPG. Substituting this nota-
tion and the value u " 16.5°, we find
vPG " (215 km/h)(cos 16.5°) # (65.0 km/h)(sin 20.0°)
" 228 km/h.

This is the plane's actual
direction of travel.
This is the wind
direction.
The actual direction
is the vector sum of
the other two vectors
(head-to-tail arrangement).
This is the plane's
orientation.

Review & Summary
Position Vector
The location of a particle relative to the ori-
gin of a coordinate system is given by a position vector
, which in
unit-vector notation is
(4-1)
Here x , y , and z
are the vector components of position vector ,
and x, y, and z are its scalar components (as well as the coordinates
of the particle). A position vector is described either by a magni-
tude and one or two angles for orientation, or by its vector or
scalar components.
Displacement
If a particle moves so that its position vector
changes from 
to 
, the particle’s displacement
is
(4-2)
The displacement can also be written as
(4-3)
" -x # -y # -z .
(4-4)
Average Velocity and Instantaneous Velocity
If a parti-
cle undergoes a displacement 
in time interval -t, its average ve-
locity
for that time interval is
(4-8)

As -t in Eq. 4-8 is shrunk to 0,
reaches a limit called either the
velocity or the instantaneous velocity :
(4-10)
which can be rewritten in unit-vector notation as
(4-11)
where vx " dx/dt, vy " dy/dt, and vz " dz/dt. The instantaneous
velocity 
of a particle is always directed along the tangent to the
particle’s path at the particle’s position.
Average Acceleration and Instantaneous Acceleration
If a particle’s velocity changes from 
to 
in time interval -t, its
average acceleration during -t is
(4-15)
As -t in Eq. 4-15 is shrunk to 0,
reaches a limiting value called
