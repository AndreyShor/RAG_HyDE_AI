WAVES—I
where y,m is the amplitude of the resultant wave and b is its phase constant. To
find the values of y,m and b, we would have to sum the two combining waves, as
we did to obtain Eq. 16-51.To do this on a phasor diagram, we vectorially add the
two phasors at any instant during their rotation, as in Fig. 16-15f where phasor ym2
has been shifted to the head of phasor ym1. The magnitude of the vector sum
equals the amplitude y,m in Eq. 16-57. The angle between the vector sum and the
phasor for y1 equals the phase constant b in Eq. 16-57.
Note that, in contrast to the method of Module 16-5:
We can use phasors to combine waves even if their amplitudes are different.
we shall sum them by components. (They are called hori-
zontal and vertical components, because the symbols x and
y are already used for the waves themselves.) For the hori-
zontal components we have
y,mh # ym1 cos 0 " ym2 cos p/3
# 4.0 mm " (3.0 mm) cos p/3 # 5.50 mm.
For the vertical components we have
y,mv # ym1 sin 0 " ym2 sin p/3
# 0 " (3.0 mm) sin p/3 # 2.60 mm.
Thus, the resultant wave has an amplitude of
# 6.1 mm

From Fig. 16-16b, phase constant b is a positive angle rela-
tive to phasor 1.Thus, the resultant wave lags wave 1 in their
travel by phase constant b # "0.44 rad. From Eq. 16-57, we
can write the resultant wave as
y,(x, t) # (6.1 mm) sin(kx $ vt " 0.44 rad).

b # tan$1 2.60 mm
5.50 mm # 0.44 rad.
y,m # 2(5.50 mm)2 " (2.60 mm)2
Sample Problem 16.05
Interference of two waves, same direction, phasors, any amplitudes
Two sinusoidal waves y1(x, t) and y2(x, t) have the same
wavelength and travel together in the same direction along
a string. Their amplitudes are ym1 # 4.0 mm and ym2 # 3.0
mm, and their phase constants are 0 and p/3 rad, respec-
tively. What are the amplitude y,m and phase constant b of
the resultant wave? Write the resultant wave in the form of
Eq. 16-57.
KEY IDEAS
(1) The two waves have a number of properties in com-
mon: Because they travel along the same string, they must
have the same speed v, as set by the tension and linear
density of the string according to Eq. 16-26. With the
same wavelength l, they have the same angular wave
number k (# 2p/l). Also, because they have the same
wave number k and speed v, they must have the same an-
gular frequency v (# kv).
(2) The waves (call them waves 1 and 2) can be repre-
sented by phasors rotating at the same angular speed v
about an origin. Because the phase constant for wave 2 is
greater than that for wave 1 by p/3, phasor 2 must lag pha-
sor 1 by p/3 rad in their clockwise rotation, as shown in
Fig. 16-16a. The resultant wave due to the interference of
waves 1 and 2 can then be represented by a phasor that is
the vector sum of phasors 1 and 2.
Calculations: To simplify the vector summation, we drew
phasors 1 and 2 in Fig. 16-16a at the instant when phasor 1
lies along the horizontal axis. We then drew lagging
phasor 2 at positive angle p/3 rad. In Fig. 16-16b
we shifted phasor 2 so its tail is at the head of phasor 1.
Then we can draw the phasor y,m of the resultant
wave from the tail of phasor 1 to the head of phasor 2.
The phase constant b is the angle phasor y,m makes with
phasor 1.
To find values for y,m and b, we can sum phasors 1 and
2 as vectors on a vector-capable calculator. However, here

phase difference p/3. (b) Vector addition of these phasors at any
instant during their rotation gives the magnitude y,m of the phasor
for the resultant wave.
