IN  WHAT  RESPECTS  ARE  THE  FOUNDATIONS 
OF  CLASSICAL  MECHANICS  AND  OF  THE 
SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY  UN 
SATISFACTORY  ? 
WE  have  already  stated  several  times  that 
classical  mechanics  starts  out  from  the  follow 
ing  law :  Material  particles  sufficiently  far 
removed  from  other  material  particles  continue  to 
move  uniformly  in  a  straight  line  or  continue  in  a 
state  of  rest.  We  have  also  repeatedly  emphasised 
that  this  fundamental  law  can  only  be  valid  for 
bodies  of  reference  K  which  possess  certain  unique 
states  of  motion,  and  which  are  in  uniform  translational 
motion  relative  to  each  other.  Relative  to  other  refer 
ence-bodies  K  the  law  is  not  valid.  Both  in  classical 
mechanics  and  in  the  special  theory  of  relativity  we 
therefore  differentiate  between  reference-bodies  K 
relative  to  which  the  recognised  "  laws  of  nature  "  can 
be  said  to  hold,  and  reference-bodies  K  relative  to  which 
these  laws  do  not  hold. 
But  no  person  whose  mode  of  thought  is  logical  can 
rest  satisfied  with  this  condition  of  things.  He  asks  : 
"  How  does  it  come  that  certain  reference-bodies  (or 
their  states  of  motion)  are  given  priority  over  other 
reference-bodies  (or  their  states  of  motion)  ?  What  is
