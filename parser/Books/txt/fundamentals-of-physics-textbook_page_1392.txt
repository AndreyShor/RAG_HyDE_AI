counter S2 and then through two Cerenkov counters C1 and C2.
These latter detectors can be manufactured so that they send a sig-
nal only when the particle passing through them is moving with a
speed that falls within a certain range. In the experiment, a particle
with a speed greater than 0.79c would trigger C1 and a particle
with a speed between 0.75c and 0.78c would trigger C2.
There were then two ways to distinguish the predicted rare
antiprotons from the abundant negative pions. Both ways involved
the fact that the speed of a 1.19 GeV/c p¯ differs from that of a 1.19
GeV/c p#: (1) According to calculations, a p¯ would trigger one of
the Cerenkov counters and a p# would trigger the other. (2) The
time interval )t between signals from S1 and S2, which were sepa-
rated by 12 m, would have one value for a p¯ and another value for a
p#. Thus, if the correct Cerenkov counter were triggered and the
time interval )t had the correct value, the experiment would prove
the existence of antiprotons.
What is the speed of (a) an antiproton with a momentum of
1.19 GeV/c and (b) a negative pion with that same momentum?
(The speed of an antiproton through the Cerenkov detectors
would actually be slightly less than calculated here because the an-
tiproton would lose a little energy within the detectors.) Which
Cerenkov detector was triggered by (c) an antiproton and (d) a
negative pion? What time interval )t indicated the passage of (e)
an antiproton and (f) a negative pion? [Problem adapted from O.

of Antiprotons,” Physical Review, Vol. 100, pp. 947–950 (1955).]
track 4 decayed into two other particles, one of which was electrically
uncharged—the path of that uncharged particle is represented by the
dashed straight line because,being electrically neutral,it would not ac-
tually leave a track in a cloud chamber.The particle that created track
8 is known to have a seriousness quantum number of zero.
By conserving the fictional quantum numbers at each decay
point and by noting the directions of curvature of the tracks, iden-
tify which particle goes with track (a) 1, (b) 2, (c) 3, (d) 4, (e) 5,
(f) 6, (g) 7, (h) 8, and (i) 9. One of the listed particles is not formed;
the others appear only once each.

Figure 44-14 shows part of the experimental arrangement in
which antiprotons were discovered in the 1950s.A beam of 6.2 GeV
protons emerged from a particle accelerator and collided with nuclei
in a copper target. According to theoretical predictions at the time,
collisions between protons in the beam and the protons and neutrons
in those nuclei should produce antiprotons via the reactions
and
However, even if these reactions did occur, they would be rare
compared to the reactions

and
Thus, most of the particles produced by the collisions between the
6.2 GeV protons and the copper target were pions.
To prove that antiprotons exist and were produced by some
limited number of the collisions, particles leaving the target were
sent into a series of magnetic fields and detectors as shown in 
Fig. 44-14. The first magnetic field (M1) curved the path of any
charged particle passing through it; moreover, the field was
arranged so that the only particles that emerged from it to reach
the second magnetic field (Q1) had to be negatively charged
(either a p¯ or a p#) and have a momentum of 1.19 GeV/c. Field Q1
was a special type of magnetic field (a quadrapole field) that
focused the particles reaching it into a beam, allowing them to pass
through a hole in thick shielding to a scintillation counter S1. The
passage of a charged particle through the counter triggered a sig-
nal, with each signal indicating the passage of either a 1.19 GeV/c
p# or (presumably) a 1.19 GeV/c p¯ .
After being refocused by magnetic field Q2, the particles were
directed by magnetic field M2 through a second scintillation
