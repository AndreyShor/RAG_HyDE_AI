INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE
Figure 30-17 The variation with time of (a) VR, the potential difference across the resistor in
the circuit of Fig. 30-16, and (b) VL, the potential difference across the inductor in that cir-
cuit.The small triangles represent successive intervals of one inductive time constant tL !
L/R.The figure is plotted for R ! 2000 1, L ! 4.0 H, and # ! 10 V.

(30-39)
Equation 30-39 is a differential equation involving the variable i and its first
derivative di/dt. To solve it, we seek the function i(t) such that when i(t) and its
first derivative are substituted in Eq. 30-39, the equation is satisfied and the initial
condition i(0) ! 0 is satisfied.
Equation 30-39 and its initial condition are of exactly the form of Eq. 27-32
for an RC circuit, with i replacing q, L replacing R, and R replacing 1/C.The solu-
tion of Eq. 30-39 must then be of exactly the form of Eq. 27-33 with the same
replacements.That solution is
(30-40)
which we can rewrite as
(rise of current).
(30-41)
Here tL, the inductive time constant, is given by
(time constant).
(30-42)
Let’s examine Eq. 30-41 for just after the switch is closed (at time t ! 0) and
for a time long after the switch is closed 
. If we substitute t ! 0 into
Eq. 30-41, the exponential becomes e%0
1. Thus, Eq. 30-41 tells us that the cur-
rent is initially i ! 0, as we expected. Next, if we let t go to ., then the exponential
goes to e%. ! 0. Thus, Eq. 30-41 tells us that the current goes to its equilibrium
value of #/R.
We can also examine the potential differences in the circuit. For example,
Fig. 30-17 shows how the potential differences VR (! iR) across the resistor and
VL (! L di/dt) across the inductor vary with time for particular values of #, L,
and R. Compare this figure carefully with the corresponding figure for an RC
circuit (Fig. 27-16).
