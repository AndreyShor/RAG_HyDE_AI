88     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
bers  in  a  corresponding  manner,  and  they  may  likewise 
be  of  arbitrary  shape.  It  follows  that  a  value  of  u  and 
a  value  of  v  belong  to  every  point  on  the  surface  of  the 
table.  We  call  these  two  numbers  the  co-ordinates 
of  the  surface  of  the  table  (Gaussian  co-ordinates). 
For  example,  the  point  P  in  the  diagram  has  the  Gaussian 
co-ordinates  Â«=3,  v=i.  Two  neighbouring  points  P 
and  P'  on  the  surface  then  correspond  to  the  co-ordinates 
P:  u,v 
P'  :  u-\-du,  v-\-dv, 
where  du  and  dv  signify  very  small  numbers.  In  a 
similar  manner  we  may  indicate  the  distance  (line- 
interval)  between  P  and  P',  as  measured  with  a  little 
rod,  by  means  of  the  very  small  number  ^s.  Then 
according  to  Gauss  we  have 
where  gn,  g12,  g22,  are  magnitudes  which  depend  in  a 
perfectly  definite  way  on  u  and  v.  The  magnitudes  gu, 
g12  and  g22  determine  the  behaviour  of  the  rods  relative 
to  the  w-curves  and  u-curves,  and  thus  also  relative 
to  the  surface  of  the  table.  For  the  case  in  which  the 
points  of  the  surface  considered  form  a  Euclidean  con 
tinuum  with  reference  to  the  measuring-rods,  but 
only  in  this  case,  it  is  possible  to  draw  the  w-curves 
and  5y-curves  and  to  attach  numbers  to  them,  in  such  a 
manner,  that  we  simply  have  : 
ds2=du*+dv*. 
Under  these  conditions,  the  w-curves  and  v-curves  are 
straight  lines  in  the  sense  of  Euclidean  geometry,  and 
they  are  perpendicular  to  each  other.  Here  the  Gaussian 
co-ordinates  are  simply  Cartesian  ones.  It  is  clear
