Three astronauts, propelled
by jet backpacks, push and guide a
120 kg asteroid toward a processing
dock, exerting the forces shown in
Fig. 5-29, with F1 " 32 N, F2 " 55 N,
F3 " 41 N, u1 " 303, and u3 " 603.
What is the asteroid’s acceleration
(a) in unit-vector notation and as (b) a magnitude and (c) a direc-
tion relative to the positive direction of the x axis?

In a two-dimensional tug-of-
war, Alex, Betty, and Charles pull
horizontally on an automobile tire at
the angles shown in the overhead
view of Fig. 5-30. The tire remains
stationary in spite of the three pulls.
Alex pulls with force 
of magni-
tude 220 N, and Charles pulls with
force 
of magnitude 170 N. Note
that the direction of 
is not given.

find the second force (a) in unit-vector
notation and as (b) a magnitude and

Only two horizontal forces act on a 3.0 kg body that can move
over a frictionless floor. One force is 9.0 N, acting due east, and the
other is 8.0 N, acting 623 north of west. What is the magnitude of
the body’s acceleration?

A vertical force 
is applied to a block of mass m that lies on
a floor.What happens to the magnitude of the normal force 
on
the block from the floor as magnitude F is increased from zero if
force 
is (a) downward and (b) upward?

Figure 5-28 shows four choices for the direction of a force of
magnitude F to be applied to a block
on an inclined plane. The directions
are either horizontal or vertical.
(For choice b, the force is not
enough to lift the block off the
plane.) Rank the choices according
to the magnitude of the normal
force acting on the block from the
plane, greatest first.
