19-6 THE DISTRIBUTION OF MOLECULAR SPEEDS
The total area under the plot of P(v) in Fig. 19-8a is the
total fraction of molecules (unity), and the area of the thin
gold strip (not to scale) is the fraction we seek. Letâ€™s evalu-
ate frac in parts:
frac # (4p)(A)(v2)(eB)(%v),
(19-36)
where
# 2.92 ' 10$9 s3/m3
and
Substituting A and B into Eq. 19-36 yields
frac # (4p)(A)(v2)(eB)(%v)
# (4p)(2.92 ' 10$9 s3/m3)(600 m/s)2(e$2.31)(2 m/s)

Sample Problem 19.05
Speed distribution in a gas
In oxygen (molar mass M = 0.0320 kg/mol) at room temper-
ature (300 K), what fraction of the molecules have speeds in
the interval 599 to 601 m/s?
KEY IDEAS
1. The speeds of the molecules are distributed over a wide
range of values,with the distribution P(v) of Eq.19-27.
2. The fraction of molecules with speeds in a differential
interval dv is P(v) dv.
3. For a larger interval, the fraction is found by integrating
P(v) over the interval.
4. However, the interval %v # 2 m/s here is small compared
to the speed v # 600 m/s on which it is centered.
Calculations: Because %v is small, we can avoid the inte-
gration by approximating the fraction as
frac # P(v) %v # 4p #
M
2pRT$

v2 e$Mv2/2RT %v.
Calculation: We end up with Eq. 19-34, which gives us
(Answer)
This result, plotted in Fig. 19-8a, is greater than vavg because
the greater speed values influence the calculation more when
we integrate the v2 values than when we integrate the v values.
(c) What is the most probable speed vP at 300 K?
KEY IDEA
Speed vP corresponds to the maximum of the distribution
function P(v), which we obtain by setting the derivative
dP/dv # 0 and solving the result for v.
Calculation: We end up with Eq. 19-35, which gives us

This result is also plotted in Fig. 19-8a.

Sample Problem 19.06
Average speed, rms speed, most probable speed
The molar mass M of oxygen is 0.0320 kg/mol.
(a) What is the average speed vavg of oxygen gas molecules
at T # 300 K?
KEY IDEA
To find the average speed, we must weight speed v with the
distribution function P(v) of Eq. 19-27 and then integrate
the resulting expression over the range of possible speeds
(from zero to the limit of an infinite speed).
Calculation: We end up with Eq. 19-31, which gives us
(Answer)
This result is plotted in Fig. 19-8a.
(b) What is the root-mean-square speed vrms at 300 K?
KEY IDEA
To find vrms, we must first find (v2)avg by weighting v2 with
the distribution function P(v) of Eq. 19-27 and then inte-
grating the expression over the range of possible speeds.
Then we must take the square root of the result.
