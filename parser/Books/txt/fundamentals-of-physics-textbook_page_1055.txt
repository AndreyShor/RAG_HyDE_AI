34-4 THIN LENSES
Sample Problem 34.04
Image produced by a system of two thin lenses
Figure 34-18a shows a jalapeño seed O1 that is placed in
front of two thin symmetrical coaxial lenses 1 and 2, with fo-
cal lengths f1 ! '24 cm and f2 ! '9.0 cm, respectively, and
with lens separation L ! 10 cm.The seed is 6.0 cm from lens
1.Where does the system of two lenses produce an image of
the seed?
KEY IDEA
We could locate the image produced by the system of
lenses by tracing light rays from the seed through the two
lenses. However, we can, instead, calculate the location of
that image by working through the system in steps, lens by
lens.We begin with the lens closer to the seed.The image we
seek is the final one—that is, image I2 produced by lens 2.
Lens 1: Ignoring lens 2, we locate the image I1 produced by
lens 1 by applying Eq. 34-9 to lens 1 alone:
The object O1 for lens 1 is the seed, which is 6.0 cm from the
lens; thus, we substitute p1 ! '6.0 cm. Also substituting the
given value of f1, we then have
which yields i1 ! &8.0 cm.
This tells us that image I1 is 8.0 cm from lens 1 and vir-
tual. (We could have guessed that it is virtual by noting that
the seed is inside the focal point of lens 1, that is, between
the lens and its focal point.) Because I1 is virtual, it is on the
same side of the lens as object O1 and has the same orienta-
tion as the seed, as shown in Fig. 34-18b.
Lens 2: In the second step of our solution, we treat image I1
as an object O2 for the second lens and now ignore lens 1.
We first note that this object O2 is outside the focal point

Calculations: We know p, but we do not know i. Thus, our
starting point is to finish the calculation for i in part (a); we
obtain
i ! (0.25)(20 cm) ! 5.0 cm.
Now Eq. 34-9 gives us
from which we find f ! 4.0 cm.

First, use the nearest
lens to locate its image.
Then use that image
as the object for the
other lens.
Figure 34-18 (a) Seed O1 is distance p1 from a two-lens system with
lens separation L. We use the arrow to orient the seed. (b) The 
image I1 produced by lens 1 alone. (c) Image I1 acts as object O2 for
lens 2 alone, which produces the final image I2.
