Sample Problem 11.02
Torque on a particle due to a force
In Fig. 11-11a, three forces, each of magnitude 2.0 N, act on a
particle. The particle is in the xz plane at point A given by
position vector , where r ! 3.0 m and u ! 30#. What is the
torque, about the origin O, due to each force?
KEY IDEA
Because the three force vectors do not lie in a plane, we
must use cross products, with magnitudes given by Eq. 11-15
(t ! rF sin f) and directions given by the right-hand rule.
Calculations: Because we want the torques with respect to
the origin O, the vector 
required for each cross product
is the given position vector. To determine the angle f be-
tween  
and each force, we shift the force vectors of Fig. 11-
11a, each in turn, so that their tails are at the origin. Figures
11-11b, c, and d, which are direct views of the xz plane, show
the shifted force vectors 
and 
, respectively. (Note

Now, applying Eq. 11-15, we find 
t1 ! rF1 sin f1 ! (3.0 m)(2.0 N)(sin 150#) ! 3.0 N)m,
t2 ! rF2 sin f2 ! (3.0 m)(2.0 N)(sin 120#) ! 5.2 N)m,
and
t3 ! rF3 sin f3 ! (3.0 m)(2.0 N)(sin 90#)
! 6.0 N)m.
(Answer)
Next, we use the right-hand rule, placing the fingers of
the right hand so as to rotate 
into 
through the smaller of
the two angles between their directions. The thumb points in
the direction of the torque.Thus t:
1 is directed into the page in
Fig. 11-11b; t:
2 is directed out of the page in Fig. 11-11c; and
t:
3 is directed as shown in Fig. 11-11d. All three torque vec-
tors are shown in Fig. 11-11e.
