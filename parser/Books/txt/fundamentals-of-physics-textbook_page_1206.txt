PHOTONS AND MATTER WAVES
in which atomic oscillators produce the thermal radiation, we have
(38-14)
where h is the Planck constant, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T
is the temperature of the radiating surface. Wien’s law relates the
temperature T of a blackbody radiator and the wavelength lmax at
which the spectral radiancy is maximum:
lmaxT ! 2898 mm $ K.

Matter Waves
A moving particle such as an electron or a pro-
ton can be described as a matter wave; its wavelength (called the
de Broglie wavelength) is given by l ! h/p, where p is the magni-
tude of the particle’s momentum.
The Wave Function
A matter wave is described by its wave
function &(x, y, z, t), which can be separated into a space-
dependent part c(x, y, z) and a time-dependent part e#ivt. For a
particle of mass m moving in the x direction with constant total en-
ergy E through a region in which its potential energy is U(x), c(x)
can be found by solving the simplified Schrödinger equation:
(38-19)
A matter wave, like a light wave, is a probability wave in the sense
that if a particle detector is inserted into the wave, the probability
that the detector will register a particle during any specified time in-
terval is proportional to |c|2, a quantity called the probability density.
For a free particle—that is, a particle for which U(x) ! 0—
moving in the x direction, |c|2 has a constant value for all positions
along the x axis.

Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle
The probabilistic
nature of quantum physics places an important limitation on de-
tecting a particle’s position and momentum. That is, it is not possi-
ble to measure the position 
and the momentum 
of a particle si-
multaneously with unlimited precision. The uncertainties in the
components of these quantities are given by
(38-28)
Potential Step
This term defines a region where a particle’s
potential energy increases at the expense of its kinetic energy.
According to classical physics, if a particle’s initial kinetic energy
exceeds the potential energy, it should never be reflected by the re-
gion. However, according to quantum physics, there is a reflection
coefficient R that gives a finite probability of reflection.The proba-
bility of transmission is T ! 1#R.
Barrier Tunneling
According to classical physics, an incident
particle will be reflected from a potential energy barrier whose
height is greater than the particle’s kinetic energy. According to
quantum physics, however, the particle has a finite probability
of tunneling through such a barrier, appearing on the other side
unchanged.The probability that a given particle of mass m and en-
ergy E will tunnel through a barrier of height Ub and thickness L is
given by the transmission coefficient T:

Let K be the kinetic energy that a sta-
tionary free electron gains when a photon
scatters from it.We can plot K versus the an-
gle f at which the photon scatters; see curve
1 in Fig. 38-21. If we switch the target to be a
stationary free proton, does the end point of
the graph shift (a) upward as suggested by
curve 2, (b) downward as suggested by curve
3, or (c) remain the same?

In a Compton-shift experiment, light (in
the x-ray range) is scattered in the forward
direction, at f ! 0 in Fig. 38-3. What
fraction of the light’s energy does the
electron acquire?

particles according to their mass,

how does its de Broglie wavelength change? (b) What if you dou-
ble the speed of the particle?

Photon A has twice the energy of photon B. (a) Is the
momentum of A less than, equal to, or greater than that of B? (b) Is
the wavelength of A less than,equal to,or greater than that of B?

In the photoelectric effect (for a given target and a given fre-
quency of the incident light), which of these quantities, if any, de-
pend on the intensity of the incident light beam: (a) the maximum
kinetic energy of the electrons, (b) the maximum photoelectric cur-
rent, (c) the stopping potential, (d) the cutoff frequency?

According to the figure for Checkpoint 2, is the maximum
kinetic energy of the ejected electrons greater for a target made of
sodium or of potassium for a given frequency of incident light?

tion, greatest first.

A metal plate is illuminated
with light of a certain frequency.
Which of the following determine whether or not electrons are
ejected: (a) the intensity of the light, (b) how long the plate is ex-
posed to the light, (c) the thermal conductivity of the plate, (d) the
area of the plate, (e) the material of which the plate is made?
