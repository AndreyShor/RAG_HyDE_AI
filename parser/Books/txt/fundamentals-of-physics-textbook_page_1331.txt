Generally, more massive nuclides tend to be more un-
stable to alpha decay. For example, the most stable isotope of ura-
nium, 238U, has an alpha decay half-life of 4.5 " 109 y.The most stable
isotope of plutonium is 244Pu with an 8.0 " 107 y half-life, and for
curium we have 248Cm and 3.4 " 105 y.When half of an original sam-
ple of 238U has decayed,what fraction of the original sample of (a) plu-
tonium and (b) curium is left?

Large radionuclides emit an alpha particle rather than other

The cesium isotope 137Cs is present in the fallout from
aboveground detonations of nuclear bombs. Because it decays with a
slow (30.2 y) half-life into 137Ba, releasing considerable energy in the
process, it is of environmental concern. The atomic masses of the Cs
and Ba are 136.9071 and 136.9058 u, respectively; calculate the total
energy released in such a decay.

add in enough electrons to use the atomic masses.)

Two radioactive materials that alpha decay, 238U and 232Th,
and one that beta decays, 40K, are sufficiently abundant in granite
to contribute significantly to the heating of Earth through the de-
cay energy produced. The alpha-decay isotopes give rise to decay
chains that stop when stable lead isotopes are formed. The isotope
40K has a single beta decay.(Assume this is the only possible decay of
that isotope.) Here is the information:
