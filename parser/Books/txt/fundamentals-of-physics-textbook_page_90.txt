This is the y component.
To locate the 
rabbit, this is the 
x component.

Check: Although u " 139° has the same tangent as $41°,
the components of position vector 
indicate that the de-
sired angle is  139° $ 180° " $41°.
(b) Graph the rabbit’s path for t " 0 to t " 25 s.
Graphing: We have located the rabbit at one instant, but to
see its path we need a graph. So we repeat part (a) for sev-
eral values of t and then plot the results. Figure 4-2b shows
the plots for six values of t and the path connecting them.

of , notice that the components form the legs of a right tri-
angle and r is the hypotenuse. So, we use Eq. 3-6:

4.06 In magnitude-angle and unit-vector notations, relate a parti-
cle’s initial and final position vectors, the time interval between
those positions, and the particle’s average velocity vector.
4.07 Given a particle’s position vector as a function of time,
determine its (instantaneous) velocity vector.
Learning Objectives
After reading this module, you should be able to . . . 
4.04 Identify that velocity is a vector quantity and thus has
both magnitude and direction and also has components.
4.05 Draw two-dimensional and three-dimensional velocity
vectors for a particle, indicating the components along the
axes of the coordinate system.
which can be rewritten in unit-vector notation as
where 
and 
●The instantaneous velocity 
of a particle is always directed
along the tangent to the particle’s path at the particle’s 
position.

Key Ideas
●If a particle undergoes a displacement 
in time interval t,
its average velocity 
for that time interval is
●As
t is shrunk to 0, 
reaches a limit called either the 
velocity or the instantaneous velocity :
