REVIEW & SUMMARY
Light Quanta—Photons
An electromagnetic wave (light) is
quantized, and its quanta are called photons. For a light wave of
frequency f and wavelength l, the energy E and momentum mag-
nitude p of a photon are
E ! hf
(photon energy)
(38-2)
and
(photon momentum).
(38-7)
Photoelectric Effect
When light of high enough frequency
falls on a clean metal surface, electrons are emitted from the sur-
face by photon–electron interactions within the metal. The gov-
erning relation is
hf ! Kmax ' 1,
(38-5)
in which hf is the photon energy, Kmax is the kinetic energy of the
most energetic emitted electrons, and 1 is the work function of the
target material—that is, the minimum energy an electron must
have if it is to emerge from the surface of the target. If hf is less
than 1, electrons are not emitted.

Review & Summary
Compton Shift
When x rays are scattered by loosely bound
electrons in a target, some of the scattered x rays have a longer
wavelength than do the incident x rays. This Compton shift (in
wavelength) is given by
(38-11)
in which f is the angle at which the x rays are scattered.
Light Waves and Photons
When light interacts with matter,
energy and momentum are transferred via photons. When light is
in transit, however, we interpret the light wave as a probability
wave, in which the probability (per unit time) that a photon can be
detected is proportional to 
, where Em is the amplitude of the
oscillating electric field of the light wave at the detector.
Ideal Blackbody Radiation
As a measure of the emission
of thermal radiation by an ideal blackbody radiator, we define the
spectral radiancy S(l) in terms of the emitted intensity per unit
wavelength at a given wavelength l. For the Planck radiation law,

and, from Eq. 38-38, the transmission coefficient is
T % e#2bL ! e#10.0 ! 45 " 10 #6.
(Answer)
Thus, of every million electrons that strike the barrier, about
45 will tunnel through it, each appearing on the other side
with its original total energy of 5.1 eV. (The transmission
through the barrier does not alter an electron’s energy or
any other property.)
(b) What is the approximate probability that a proton
with the same total energy of 5.1 eV will be transmitted
through the barrier, to appear (and be detectable) on the
other side of the barrier?
Reasoning: The transmission coefficient T (and thus the
probability of transmission) depends on the mass of the
particle. Indeed, because mass m is one of the factors in the
exponent of e in the equation for T, the probability of trans-
mission is very sensitive to the mass of the particle.This time,
the mass is that of a proton (1.67 " 10#27 kg), which is signif-
icantly greater than that of the electron in (a). By substitut-
ing the proton’s mass for the mass in (a) and then continuing
as we did there, we find that T % 10#186. Thus, although the
probability that the proton will be transmitted is not exactly
zero, it is barely more than zero. For even more massive par-
ticles with the same total energy of 5.1 eV, the probability of
transmission is exponentially lower.
Sample Problem 38.06
Barrier tunneling by matter wave
Suppose that the electron in Fig. 38-17, having a total energy
E of 5.1 eV, approaches a barrier of height Ub ! 6.8 eV and
thickness L ! 750 pm.
(a) What is the approximate probability that the electron
will be transmitted through the barrier, to appear (and be
detectable) on the other side of the barrier?
KEY IDEA
The probability we seek is the transmission coefficient T as
given by Eq. 38-38 (T % e#2bL), where
Calculations: The numerator of the fraction under the
square-root sign is

Thus,
The (dimensionless) quantity 2bL is then
