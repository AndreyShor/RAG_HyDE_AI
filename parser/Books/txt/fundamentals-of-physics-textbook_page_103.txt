The scalar components of

Now, using the right triangle in Fig. 4-17a, we can replace sin u with yp/r and
cos u with xp/r to write
(4-37)
To find the acceleration 
of particle p, we must take the time derivative of this
equation.Noting that speed v and radius r do not change with time,we obtain
(4-38)
Now note that the rate dyp/dt at which yp changes is equal to the velocity
component vy. Similarly, dxp/dt " vx, and, again from Fig. 4-17b, we see that vx "
$v sin u and vy " v cos u. Making these substitutions in Eq. 4-38, we find
.

This vector and its components are shown in Fig. 4-17c. Following Eq. 3-6, we find
as we wanted to prove.To orient , we find the angle f shown in Fig. 4-17c:
.
Thus, f " u, which means that 
is directed along the radius r of Fig. 4-17a,
toward the circle’s center, as we wanted to prove.

Checkpoint 5
An object moves at constant speed along a circular path in a horizontal xy plane, with
the center at the origin.When the object is at x " $2 m, its velocity is $(4 m/s) . Give
the object’s (a) velocity and (b) acceleration at y " 2 m.

Sample Problem 4.06 Top gun pilots in turns
KEY IDEAS
We assume the turn is made with uniform circular motion.
Then the pilot’s acceleration is centripetal and has magni-
tude a given by Eq. 4-34 (a " v2/R), where R is the circle’s
radius.Also, the time required to complete a full circle is the
period given by Eq. 4-35 (T " 2pR/v).
Calculations: Because we do not know radius R, let’s solve
Eq. 4-35 for R and substitute into Eq. 4-34.We find
To get the constant speed v, let’s substitute the components
of the initial velocity into Eq. 3-6:
v " 2(400 m/s)2 # (500 m/s)2 "  640.31 m/s.

“Top gun” pilots have long worried about taking a turn too
tightly. As a pilot’s body undergoes centripetal acceleration,
with the head toward the center of curvature, the blood pres-
sure in the brain decreases, leading to loss of brain function.
There are several warning signs. When the centripetal
acceleration is 2g or 3g, the pilot feels heavy. At about 4g,
the pilot’s vision switches to black and white and narrows to
“tunnel vision.” If that acceleration is sustained or in-
creased, vision ceases and, soon after, the pilot is uncon-
scious—a condition known as g-LOC for “g-induced loss of
consciousness.”
What is the magnitude of the acceleration, in g units, of
a pilot whose aircraft enters a horizontal circular turn with a
velocity of 
(400ˆi
500ˆj) m/s and 24.0 s later leaves the
turn with a velocity of 
(
400ˆi
500ˆj) m/s?
