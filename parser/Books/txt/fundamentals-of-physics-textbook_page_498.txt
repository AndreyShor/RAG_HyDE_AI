Module 16-1
Transverse Waves
•1
If a wave y(x, t) # (6.0 mm) sin(kx " (600 rad/s)t " f) travels
along a string, how much time does any given point on the string take
to move between displacements y # "2.0 mm and y # $2.0 mm?
•2
A human wave. During
sporting events within large, densely
packed stadiums,
spectators will
send a wave (or pulse) around the
stadium (Fig. 16-29). As the wave
reaches a group of spectators, they
stand with a cheer and then sit. At
any instant, the width w of the wave
is the distance from the leading edge (people are just about to stand)
to the trailing edge (people have just sat down). Suppose a human
wave travels a distance of 853 seats around a stadium in 39 s, with
spectators requiring about 1.8 s to respond to the wave’s passage by
standing and then sitting.What are (a) the wave speed v (in seats per
second) and (b) width w (in number of seats)?
•3
A wave has an angular frequency of 110 rad/s and a wave-
length of 1.80 m. Calculate (a) the angular wave number and
(b) the speed of the wave.
•4
A sand scorpion can de-
tect the motion of a nearby beetle
(its prey) by the waves the motion
sends along the sand surface (Fig.
16-30). The waves are of two types:
transverse 
waves 
traveling 
at
and longitudinal waves
traveling at 
. If a sud-
den motion sends out such waves, a
scorpion can tell the distance of the
beetle from the difference %t in the
arrival times of the waves at its leg
nearest the beetle. If %t # 4.0 ms,
what is the beetle’s distance?
•5
A sinusoidal wave travels along
a string. The time for a particular
point to move from maximum displacement to zero is 0.170 s.What
are the (a) period and (b) frequency? (c) The wavelength is 1.40 m;
what is the wave speed?
••6
A sinusoidal wave travels
along a string under tension.
Figure 16-31 gives the slopes
along the string at time t # 0.The
scale of the x axis is set by xs #
0.80 m. What is the amplitude of
the wave?
••7
A transverse sinusoidal wave is moving along a string in the
positive direction of an x axis with a speed of 80 m/s. At t # 0, the
string particle at x # 0 has a transverse displacement of 4.0 cm
from its equilibrium position and is not moving. The maximum
vl # 150 m/s
vt # 50 m/s
transverse speed of the string particle at x # 0 is 16 m/s. (a) What is
the frequency of the wave? (b) What is the wavelength of the
wave? If y(x, t) # ym sin(kx ! vt " f) is the form of the wave
equation, what are (c) ym, (d) k, (e) v, (f) f, and (g) the correct
choice of sign in front of v?
••8
Figure 16-32 shows the trans-
verse velocity u versus time t of the
point on a string at x # 0, as a wave
passes through it.The scale on the ver-
tical axis is set by us # 4.0 m/s. The
wave has the generic form y(x, t) #
ymsin(kx $ vt " f). What then is f?
(Caution: A calculator does not always
give the proper inverse trig function,so
check your answer by substituting it
and an assumed value of v into y(x, t) and then plotting the function.)
••9
A sinusoidal wave mov-
ing along a string is shown
twice in Fig. 16-33, as crest A
travels in the positive direc-
tion of an x axis by distance
d # 6.0 cm in 4.0 ms. The
tick marks along the axis are
separated by 10 cm; height
H # 6.00 mm. The equation
for the wave is in the form
y(x, t) # ym sin(kx ! vt), so
what are (a) ym, (b) k, (c) v, and (d) the correct choice of sign in
front of v?
••10
The equation of a transverse wave traveling along a very
long string is y # 6.0 sin(0.020px " 4.0pt), where x and y are ex-
pressed in centimeters and t is in seconds. Determine (a) the ampli-
tude, (b) the wavelength, (c) the frequency, (d) the speed, (e) the
direction of propagation of the wave, and (f) the maximum trans-
verse speed of a particle in the string. (g) What is the transverse
displacement at x # 3.5 cm when t #
0.26 s?
••11
A sinusoidal transverse wave
of wavelength 20 cm travels along a
string in the positive direction of an
x axis. The displacement y of the
string particle at x # 0 is given in
Fig. 16-34 as a function of time t. The scale  of the vertical axis is
set by ys # 4.0 cm. The wave equation is to be in the form 
y(x, t) # ym sin(kx ! vt " f). (a) At t # 0, is a plot of y versus x in
the shape of a positive sine function or a negative sine function?
What are (b) ym, (c) k, (d) v, (e) f, (f) the sign in front of v, and (g)
the speed of the wave? (h) What is the transverse velocity of the par-
ticle at x # 0 when t # 5.0 s?
••12
The function y(x, t) # (15.0 cm) cos(px $ 15pt), with x in
meters and t in seconds, describes a wave on a taut string. What is
