Sample Problem 10.09
Using Newton’s second law for rotation in a basic judo hip throw
To throw an 80 kg opponent with a basic judo hip throw, you
intend to pull his uniform with a force 
and a moment arm
d1 ! 0.30 m from a pivot point (rotation axis) on your right
hip (Fig. 10-18). You wish to rotate him about the pivot
point with an angular acceleration a of %6.0 rad/s2—that is,
with an angular acceleration that is clockwise in the figure.
Assume that his rotational inertia I relative to the pivot
point is 15 kg)m2.
(a) What must the magnitude of 
be if, before you throw
him, you bend your opponent forward to bring his center of
mass to your hip (Fig. 10-18a)?
KEY IDEA 
We can relate your pull 
on your opponent to the given an-
gular acceleration a via Newton’s second law for rotation
(tnet ! Ia).
Calculations: As his feet leave the floor, we can assume that
only three forces act on him: your pull 
, a force 
on him
from you at the pivot point (this force is not indicated in Fig.
10-18), and the gravitational force 
.To use tnet ! Ia, we need
the corresponding three torques,each about the pivot point.

is now equal to d2mg and is positive because the

(Answer)
The results indicate that you will have to pull much harder if
you do not initially bend your opponent to bring his center
of mass to your hip. A good judo fighter knows this lesson
from physics. Indeed, physics is the basis of most of the mar-
tial arts, figured out after countless hours of trial and error
over the centuries.
