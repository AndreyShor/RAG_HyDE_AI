31-5 POWER IN ALTERNATING-CURRENT CIRCUITS
determined by the rms value of the driving emf and the cir-
cuit’s impedance Z (which we know), according to Eq. 31-73:
Substituting this into Eq. 31-76 then leads to

Second way: Instead, we can write

(c) What new capacitance Cnew is needed to maximize Pavg if
the other parameters of the circuit are not changed?
KEY IDEAS
(1) The average rate Pavg at which energy is supplied
and dissipated is maximized if the circuit is brought into
resonance with the driving emf. (2) Resonance occurs
when XC ! XL.
Calculations: From the given data, we have XC - XL. Thus,
we must decrease XC to reach resonance. From Eq. 31-39
(XC ! 1/vdC), we see that this means we must increase C to
the new value Cnew.
Using Eq. 31-39, we can write the resonance condition
XC ! XL as
Substituting 2pfd for vd (because we are given fd and not vd)
and then solving for Cnew, we find
(Answer)
Following the procedure of part (b), you can show that with
Cnew, the average power of energy dissipation Pavg would
then be at its maximum value of

(a) What are the power factor cos f and phase constant f of
the circuit?
KEY IDEA
The power factor cos f can be found from the resistance R
and impedance Z via Eq. 31-75 (cos f ! R/Z).
Calculations: To calculate Z, we use Eq. 31-61:
Equation 31-75 then gives us
(Answer)
Taking the inverse cosine then yields
f ! cos'1 0.944 ! .19.3°.
The inverse cosine on a calculator gives only the positive an-
swer here, but both 19.3 and 19.3 have a cosine of 0.944.
To determine which sign is correct, we must consider
whether the current leads or lags the driving emf. Because
XC - XL, this circuit is mainly capacitive, with the current
leading the emf.Thus,f must be negative:
f ! '19.3°.
(Answer)
We could, instead, have found f with Eq. 31-65.A calculator
would then have given us the answer with the minus  sign.
(b) What is the average rate Pavg at which energy is
dissipated in the resistance?
KEY IDEAS
There are two ways and two ideas to use: (1) Because the
circuit is assumed to be in steady-state operation, the rate at
which energy is dissipated in the resistance is equal to the
rate at which energy is supplied to the circuit, as given by
Eq. 31-76 (Pavg ! #rmsIrms cos f). (2) The rate at which
energy is dissipated in a resistance R depends on the square
of the rms current Irms through it, according to Eq. 31-71
(Pavg! I 2
rmsR).
First way: We are given the rms driving emf #rms and we
already know cos f from part (a). The rms current Irms is
