and so the simpler of the two numbers can be used in computations. Thus, by
looking at only the decimal number and comparing it to 0, 0.5, or 1.0 wavelength,
you can quickly tell what type of interference two waves have.
16-5 INTERFERENCE OF WAVES
Checkpoint 4
Here are four possible phase differences between two identical waves, expressed in
wavelengths: 0.20, 0.45, 0.60, and 0.80. Rank them according to the amplitude of the 
resultant wave, greatest first.

(b) What phase difference, in radians and wavelengths, will
give the resultant wave an amplitude of 4.9 mm?
Calculations: Now we are given y,m and seek f. From Eq.
16-52,
y,m # |2ym cos f|,
we now have
4.9 mm # (2)(9.8 mm) cos f,
which gives us (with a calculator in the radian mode)
# !2.636 rad % !2.6 rad.
(Answer)
There are two solutions because we can obtain the same re-
sultant wave by letting the first wave lead (travel ahead of)
or lag (travel behind) the second wave by 2.6 rad. In wave-
lengths, the phase difference is
# !0.42 wavelength.

Sample Problem 16.04
Interference of two waves, same direction, same amplitude
Two identical sinusoidal waves, moving in the same 
direction along a stretched string, interfere with each other.
The amplitude ym of each wave is 9.8 mm, and the phase
difference f between them is 100-.
(a) What is the amplitude y,m of the resultant wave due to the
interference,and what is the type of this interference?
KEY IDEA
These are identical sinusoidal waves traveling in the same
direction along a string, so they interfere to produce a
sinusoidal traveling wave.
Calculations: Because they are identical, the waves  have
the same amplitude. Thus, the amplitude y,m of the resultant
wave is given by Eq. 16-52:
y,m # |2ym cos f| # |(2)(9.8 mm) cos(100-/2)|
# 13 mm.
(Answer)
We can tell that the interference is intermediate in two ways.
The phase difference is between 0 and 180-, and, correspond-
ingly,the amplitude y,m is between 0 and 2ym (# 19.6 mm).
