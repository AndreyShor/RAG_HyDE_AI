Why can we use mathematics to describe nature without a mech-
anism behind it? No one knows. We have to keep going because
we ﬁnd out more that way.
Many mechanisms for gravitation have been suggested. It is in-
teresting to consider one of these, which many people have thought
of from time to time. At ﬁrst, one is quite excited and happy when
he “discovers” it, but he soon ﬁnds that it is not correct. It was ﬁrst
discovered about 1750. Suppose there were many particles moving
in space at a very high speed in all directions and being only slightly
absorbed in going through matter. When they are absorbed, they
give an impulse to the earth. However, since there are as many
going one way as another, the impulses all balance. But when the
sun is nearby, the particles coming toward the earth through the sun
are partially absorbed, so fewer of them are coming from the sun
than are coming from the other side. Therefore, the earth feels a net
impulse toward the sun and it does not take one long to see that it
is inversely proportional to the square of the distance—because of
the variation of the solid angle that the sun subtends as we vary the
distance. What is wrong with that machinery? It involves some new
consequences which are not true. This particular idea has the fol-
