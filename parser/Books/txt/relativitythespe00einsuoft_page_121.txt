themselves  and  the  action  of  the  other  planets  under 
consideration.  Thus,  if  we  correct  the  observed  motion 
of  the  planets  for  these  two  influences,  and  if  Newton's 
theory  be  strictly  correct,  we  ought  to  obtain  for  the 
orbit  of  the  planet  an  ellipse,  which  is  fixed  with  re 
ference  to  the  fixed  stars.  This  deduction,  which  can 
be  tested  with  great  accuracy,  has  been  confirmed 
for  all  the  planets  save  one,  with  the  precision  that  is 
capable  of  being  obtained  by  the  delicacy  of  observation 
attainable  at  the  present  time.  The  sole  exception 
is  Mercury,  the  planet  which  lies  nearest  the  sun.  Since 
the  time  of  Leverrier,  it  has  been  known  that  the  ellipse 
corresponding  to  the  orbit  of  Mercury,  after  it  has  been 
corrected  for  the  influences  mentioned  above,  is  not 
stationary  with  respect  to  the  fixed  stars,  but  that  it 
rotates  exceedingly  slowly  in  the  plane  of  the  orbit 
and  in  the  sense  of  the  orbital  motion.  The  value 
obtained  for  this  rotary  movement  of  the  orbital  ellipse 
was  43  seconds  of  arc  per  century,  an  amount  ensured 
to  be  correct  to  within  a  few  seconds  of  arc.  This 
effect  can  be  explained  by  means  of  classical  mechanics 
only  on  the  assumption  of  hypotheses  which  have 
little  probability,  and  which  were  devised  solely  for 
this  purpose. 
On  the  basis  of  the  general  theory  of  relativity,  it 
is  found  that  the  ellipse  of  every  planet  round  the  sun 
must  necessarily  rotate  in  the  manner  indicated  above  ; 
that  for  all  the  planets,  with  the  exception  of  Mercury, 
this  rotation  is  too  small  to  be  detected  with  the  delicacy 
of  observation  possible  at  the  present  time  ;  but  that  in 
the  case  of  Mercury  it  must  amount  to  43  seconds  of 
arc  per  century,  a  result  which  is  strictly  in  agreement 
with  observation.
