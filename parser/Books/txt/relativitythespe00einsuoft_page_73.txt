MINKOWSKFS  FOUR-DIMENSIONAL  SPACE 
THE  non-mathematician  is  seized  by  a  mysterious 
shuddering  when  he  hears  of  "  four-dimensional" 
tilings,  by  a  feeling  not  unlike  that  awakened  by 
thoughts  of  the  occult.     And   yet  there  is  no    more 
common-place  statement  than  that  the  world  in  which 
we  live  is  a  four-dimensional  space-time  continuum. 
Space  is  a  three-dimensional  continuum.  By  this 
we  mean  that  it  is  possible  to  describe  the  position  of  a 
point  (at  rest)  by  means  of  three  numbers  (co-ordinates) 
x,  y,  z,  and  that  there  is  an  indefinite  number  of  points 
in  the  neighbourhood  of  this  one,  the  position  of  which 
can  be  described  by  co-ordinates  such  as  xlf  ylt  zlt  which 
may  be  as  near  as  we  choose  to  the  respective  values  of 
the  co-ordinates  x,  y,  z  of  the  first  point.  In  virtue  of  the 
latter  property  we  speak  of  a  "  continuum,"  and  owing 
to  the  fact  that  there  are  three  co-ordinates  we  speak  of 
it  as  being  "  three-dimensional." 
Similarly,  the  world  of  physical  phenomena  which  was 
briefly  called  "  world "  by  Minkowski  is  naturally 
four-dimensional  in  the  space-time  sense.  For  it  is 
composed  of  individual  events,  each  of  which  is  de 
scribed  by  four  numbers,  namely,  three  space 
co-ordinates  x,  y,  z  and  a  time  co-ordinate,  the  time- 
value  t.  The  "  world  "  is  in  this  sense  also  a  continuum ; 
for  to  every  event  there  are  as  many  "  neighbouring  "
