16-1 TRANSVERSE WAVES
The value of f can be chosen so that the function gives some other displacement
and slope at x # 0 when t # 0. For example, a choice of f # "p/5 rad gives the
displacement and slope shown in Fig. 16-6b when t # 0. The wave is still
sinusoidal with the same values of ym, k, and v, but it is now shifted from what
you see in Fig. 16-6a (where f # 0). Note also the direction of the shift.A positive
value of f shifts the curve in the negative direction of the x axis; a negative value
shifts the curve in the positive direction.
The Speed of a Traveling Wave
Figure 16-7 shows two snapshots of the wave of Eq. 16-2, taken a small time
interval %t apart. The wave is traveling in the positive direction of x (to the right
in Fig. 16-7), the entire wave pattern moving a distance %x in that direction
during the interval %t. The ratio %x/%t (or, in the differential limit, dx/dt) is the
wave speed v. How can we find its value?
As the wave in Fig.16-7 moves,each point of the moving wave form,such as point
A marked on a peak,retains its displacement y.(Points on the string do not retain their
displacement,but points on the wave form do.) If point A retains its displacement as it
moves,the phase in Eq.16-2 giving it that displacement must remain a constant:
kx $ vt # a constant.
(16-11)
Note that although this argument is constant, both x and t are changing. In fact,
as t increases, x must also, to keep the argument constant. This confirms that the
wave pattern is moving in the positive direction of x.
To find the wave speed v, we take the derivative of Eq. 16-11, getting
or
(16-12)
Using Eq. 16-5 (k # 2p/l) and Eq. 16-8 (v # 2p/T), we can rewrite the wave
speed as
(wave speed).
(16-13)
The equation v # l/T tells us that the wave speed is one wavelength per period;
the wave moves a distance of one wavelength in one period of oscillation.
Equation 16-2 describes a wave moving in the positive direction of x.We can
find the equation of a wave traveling in the opposite direction by replacing t in
Eq. 16-2 with $t.This corresponds to the condition
kx " vt # a constant,
(16-14)
which (compare Eq. 16-11) requires that x decrease with time. Thus, a wave trav-
eling in the negative direction of x is described by the equation
y(x, t) # ym sin(kx " vt).
(16-15)
If you analyze the wave of Eq. 16-15 as we have just done for the wave of
Eq. 16-2, you will find for its velocity
(16-16)
The minus sign (compare Eq. 16-12) verifies that the wave is indeed moving in the
negative direction of x and justifies our switching the sign of the time variable.
