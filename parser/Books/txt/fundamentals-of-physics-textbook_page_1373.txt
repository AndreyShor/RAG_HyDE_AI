The Eightfold Way
There are eight baryons—the neutron and the proton among them—that have
a spin quantum number of . Table 44-3 shows some of their other properties.
Figure 44-3a shows the fascinating pattern that emerges if we plot the strangeness
of these baryons against their charge quantum number, using a sloping axis for
the charge quantum numbers. Six of the eight form a hexagon with the two
remaining baryons at its center.
Let us turn now from the hadrons called baryons to the hadrons called mesons.
Nine with a spin of zero are listed in Table 44-4. If we plot them on a sloping
strangeness–charge diagram, as in Fig. 44-3b, the same fascinating pattern
emerges! These and related plots, called the eightfold way patterns,* were pro-
posed independently in 1961 by Murray Gell-Mann at the California Institute of
Technology and by Yuval Ne’eman at Imperial College, London.The two patterns
of Fig. 44-3 are representative of a larger number of symmetrical patterns in which
groups of baryons and mesons can be displayed.
The symmetry of the eightfold way pattern for the spin- baryons (not shown
here) calls for ten particles arranged in a pattern like that of the tenpins in a bowl-
ing alley. However, when the pattern was first proposed, only nine such particles
were known; the “headpin” was missing. In 1962, guided by theory and the symme-
try of the pattern,Gell-Mann made a prediction in which he essentially said:
There exists a spin-
baryon with a charge of #1, a strangeness of #3, and a rest
energy of about 1680 MeV. If you look for this omega minus particle (as I propose
to call it), I think you will find it.
A team of physicists headed by Nicholas Samios of the Brookhaven National
Laboratory took up the challenge and found the “missing” particle, confirming all
its predicted properties. Nothing beats prompt experimental confirmation for
building confidence in a theory!
The eightfold way patterns bear the same relationship to particle physics
that the periodic table does to chemistry. In each case, there is a pattern of or-
ganization in which vacancies (missing particles or missing elements) stick out
like sore thumbs, guiding experimenters in their searches. In the case of the 
periodic table, its very existence strongly suggests that the atoms of the ele-
ments are not fundamental particles but have an underlying structure.

*The name is a borrowing from Eastern mysticism.The “eight” refers to the eight quantum numbers
(only a few of which we have defined here) that are involved in the symmetry-based theory that pre-
dicts the existence of the patterns.
