PROJECTILE MOTION
Sample Problem 4.05 Launched into the air from a water slide
One of the most dramatic videos on the web (but entirely
fictitious) supposedly shows a man sliding along a long wa-
ter slide and then being launched into the air to land in a
water pool. Let’s attach some reasonable numbers to such
a flight to calculate the velocity with which the man would
have hit the water. Figure 4-15a indicates the launch and
landing sites and includes a superimposed coordinate sys-
tem with its origin conveniently located at the launch site.
From the video we take the horizontal flight distance as
D " 20.0 m, the flight time as t " 2.50 s, and the launch an-
gle as 
0 " 40.0°. Find the magnitude of the velocity at
launch and at landing.
KEY IDEAS
(1) For projectile motion, we can apply the equations for con-
stant acceleration along the horizontal and vertical axes sepa-
rately. (2) Throughout the flight, the vertical acceleration is 
ay " $g " $9.8 m/s and the horizontal acceleration is 
.
Calculations: In most projectile problems, the initial chal-
lenge is to figure out where to start. There is nothing wrong
with trying out various equations, to see if we can somehow
get to the velocities. But here is a clue. Because we are going
to apply the constant-acceleration equations separately to
the x and y motions, we should find the horizontal and verti-
cal components of the velocities at launch and at landing.
For each site, we can then combine the velocity components
to get the velocity.
Because we know the horizontal displacement D "
20.0 m, let’s start with the horizontal motion. Since

we know that the horizontal velocity component 
is con-
stant during the flight and thus is always equal to the hori-
zontal component v0x at launch. We can relate that compo-
nent, the displacement 
and the flight time t " 2.50 s
with Eq. 2-15:
(4-32)
Substituting 
this becomes Eq. 4-21. With 
we then write
That is a component of the launch velocity, but we need
the magnitude of the full vector, as shown in Fig. 4-15b,
where the components form the legs of a right triangle and
the full vector forms the hypotenuse. We can then apply a
trig definition to find the magnitude of the full velocity at
launch:
and so
(Answer)
Now let’s go after the magnitude v of the landing veloc-
ity. We already know the horizontal component, which does
not change from its initial value of 8.00 m/s.To find the verti-
cal component vy and because we know the elapsed time t "
2.50 s and the vertical acceleration 
let’s
rewrite Eq. 2-11 as
and then (from Fig. 4-15b) as
(4-33)
Substituting ay " $g,this becomes Eq.4-23.We can then write
Now that we know both components of the landing velocity,
we use Eq. 3-6 to find the velocity magnitude:
