26-2 CURRENT DENSITY
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
26.05 Identify a current density and a current density vector.
26.06 For current through an area element on a cross section
through a conductor (such as a wire), identify the element’s
area vector 
.
26.07 Find the current through a cross section of a conductor
by integrating the dot product of the current density
vector
and the element area vector 
over the
full cross section.
26.08 For the case where current is uniformly spread over
a cross section in a conductor, apply the relationship

between the current i, the current density magnitude J,
and the area A.
26.09 Identify streamlines.
26.10 Explain the motion of conduction electrons in terms of
their drift speed.
26.11 Distinguish the drift speeds of conduction electrons from
their random-motion speeds, including relative magnitudes.
26.12 Identify carrier charge density n.
26.13 Apply the relationship between current density J,
charge carrier density n, and charge carrier drift speed vd.
Learning Objectives
●Current i (a scalar quantity) is related to current density 
(a vector quantity) by
where 
is a vector perpendicular to a surface element 
of area dA and the integral is taken over any surface
cutting across the conductor. The current density 
has
the same direction as the velocity of the moving charges if

they are positive and the opposite direction if they are
negative.
●When an electric field 
is established in a conductor, the
charge carriers (assumed positive) acquire a drift speed vd in
the direction of

●The drift velocity 
is related to the current density by

Key Ideas

We substitute 10 electrons per molecule because a water
(H2O) molecule contains 8 electrons in the single oxygen
atom and 1 electron in each of the two hydrogen atoms.
We can express the rate dN/dt in terms of the given vol-
ume flow rate dV/dt by first writing
“Molecules per mole” is Avogadro’s number NA.“Moles per
unit mass” is the inverse of the mass per mole, which is the
molar mass M of water.“Mass per unit volume” is the (mass)
density rmass of water. The volume per second is the volume
flow rate dV/dt.Thus,we have

Substituting this into the equation for i, we find
We know that Avogadro’s number NA is 6.02 $ 10 23 mole-
cules/mol, or 6.02 $ 10 23 mol#1, and from Table 15-1 we
know that the density of water rmass under normal condi-
tions is 1000 kg/m3.We can get the molar mass of water from
the molar masses listed in Appendix F (in grams per mole):
We add the molar mass of oxygen (16 g/mol) to twice the
molar mass of hydrogen (1 g/mol), obtaining 18 g/mol !
0.018 kg/mol. So, the current of negative charge due to the
electrons in the water is
(Answer)
This current of negative charge is exactly compensated by a
current of positive charge associated with the nuclei of the
three atoms that make up the water molecule.Thus, there is
no net flow of charge through the hose.
