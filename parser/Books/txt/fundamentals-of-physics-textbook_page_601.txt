A Graphical Summary of Four Gas Processes
In this chapter we have discussed four special processes that
an ideal gas can undergo. An example of each (for a mon-
atomic ideal gas) is shown in Fig. 19-16, and some associated
characteristics are given in Table 19-4, including two process
names (isobaric and isochoric) that we have not used but
that you might see in other courses.

KEY IDEA
The temperature does not change in a free expansion be-
cause there is nothing to change the kinetic energy of the
molecules.
Calculation: Thus, the temperature is
Tf # Ti # 310 K.
(Answer)
We find the new pressure using Eq. 19-63, which gives us

Kinetic Theory of Gases
The kinetic theory of gases relates
the macroscopic properties of gases (for example, pressure and
temperature) to the microscopic properties of gas molecules (for
example, speed and kinetic energy).
Avogadro’s Number
One mole of a substance contains
NA (Avogadro’s number) elementary units (usually atoms or mole-
cules), where NA is found experimentally to be
NA # 6.02 ' 1023 mol$1
(Avogadro’s number).

Review & Summary
One molar mass M of any substance is the mass of one mole of the
substance. It is related to the mass m of the individual molecules of
the substance by
M # mNA.

consisting of N molecules, is given by
