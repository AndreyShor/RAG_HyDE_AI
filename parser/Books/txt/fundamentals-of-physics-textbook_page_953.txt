Learning Objectives
●In a series RLC circuit, the average power Pavg of the
generator is equal to the production rate of thermal energy in
the resistor:
Pavg ! I 2
rmsR ! #rmsIrms cos f.
●The abbreviation rms stands for root-mean-square; the
rms quantities are related to the maximum quantities by
and 
The term 
cos f is called the power factor of the circuit.
#rms ! #m/12.

Power in Alternating-Current Circuits
In the RLC circuit of Fig. 31-7, the source of energy is the alternating-current
generator. Some of the energy that it provides is stored in the electric field in the
capacitor, some is stored in the magnetic field in the inductor, and some is dis-
sipated as thermal energy in the resistor. In steady-state operation, the average
stored energy remains constant.The net transfer of energy is thus from the gener-
ator to the resistor, where energy is dissipated.
The instantaneous rate at which energy is dissipated in the resistor can be
written, with the help of Eqs. 26-27 and 31-29, as
P ! i2R ! [I sin(vdt ' f)]2R ! I 2R sin2(vdt ' f).
(31-68)
The average rate at which energy is dissipated in the resistor, however, is the aver-
age of Eq. 31-68 over time. Over one complete cycle, the average value of sin u,
where u is any variable, is zero (Fig. 31-17a) but the average value of sin2 u is
(Fig. 31-17b). (Note in Fig. 31-17b how the shaded areas under the curve but
above the horizontal line marked 
exactly fill in the unshaded spaces below
that line.) Thus, we can write, from Eq. 31-68,
(31-69)
The quantity 
is called the root-mean-square, or rms, value of the current i:
(rms current).
(31-70)
We can now rewrite Eq. 31-69 as
(average power).
