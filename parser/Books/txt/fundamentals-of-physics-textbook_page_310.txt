CHAPTER 10
ROTATION
Sample Problem 10.11
Work, rotational kinetic energy, torque, disk
Let the disk in Fig. 10-19 start from rest at time t ! 0 and
also let the tension in the massless cord be 6.0 N and the an-
gular acceleration of the disk be %24 rad/s2.What is its rota-
tional kinetic energy K at t ! 2.5 s?
KEY IDEA
We can find K with Eq. 10-34 
We already know
(K ! 1
2Iv2).
Calculations: First, we relate the change in the kinetic 
energy of the disk to the net work W done on the disk, using
the work–kinetic energy theorem of Eq. 10-52 (Kf % Ki ! W).
With K substituted for Kf and 0 for Ki,we get
K ! Ki & W ! 0 & W ! W.
(10-60)
Next we want to find the work W. We can relate W to
the torques acting on the disk with Eq. 10-53 or 10-54. The
only torque causing angular acceleration and doing work is
the torque due to force 
on the disk from the cord, which is
T

, but we do not yet know v at t ! 2.5 s.
However, because the angular acceleration a has the con-
stant value of %24 rad/s2, we can apply the equations for
constant angular acceleration in Table 10-1.
Calculations: Because we want v and know a and v0 (! 0),
we use Eq.10-12:
v ! v0 & at ! 0 & at ! at.
Substituting v ! at and 
into Eq.10-34,we find

KEY IDEA
We can also get this answer by finding the disk’s kinetic 
energy from the work done on the disk.

circular path, only the tangential component Ft of the force accelerates the parti-
cle along the path. Therefore, only Ft does work on the particle. We write that
work dW as Ft ds. However, we can replace ds with r du, where du is the angle
through which the particle moves.Thus we have
dW ! Ftr du.
(10-58)
From Eq. 10-40, we see that the product Ftr is equal to the torque t, so we can
rewrite Eq. 10-58 as
dW ! t du.
(10-59)
The work done during a finite angular displacement from ui to uf is then
which is Eq. 10-53. It holds for any rigid body rotating about a fixed axis.
Equation 10-54 comes directly from Eq. 10-53.
We can find the power P for rotational motion from Eq. 10-59:
which is Eq. 10-55.

equal to %TR. Because a is constant, this torque also must
be constant.Thus, we can use Eq. 10-54 to write
W ! t(uf % ui) ! %TR(uf % ui).
(10-61)
Because a is constant, we can use Eq. 10-13 to find
uf % ui.With vi ! 0, we have
.
Now we substitute this into Eq. 10-61 and then substitute the
result into Eq. 10-60. Inserting the given values T ! 6.0 N
and a ! %24 rad/s2, we have
