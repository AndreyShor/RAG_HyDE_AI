GEOMETRICAL  PROPOSITIONS  3 
give  to  its  structure  the  largest  possible  logical  unity. 
The  practice,  for  example,  of  seeing  in  a  "  distance  " 
two  marked  positions  on  a  practically  rigid  body  is 
something  which  is  lodged  deeply  in  our  habit  of  thought. 
We  are  accustomed  further  to  regard  three  points  as 
being  situated  on  a  straight  line,  if  their  apparent 
positions  can  be  made  to  coincide  for  observation  with 
one  eye,  under  suitable  choice  of  our  place  of  observa 
tion. 
If,  in  pursuance  of  our  habit  of  thought,  we  now 
supplement  the  propositions  of  Euclidean  geometry  by 
the  single  proposition  that  two  points  on  a  practically 
rigid  body  always  correspond  to  the  same  distance 
(line-interval),  independently  of  any  changes  in  position 
to  which  we  may  subject  the  body,  the  propositions  of 
Euclidean  geometry  then  resolve  themselves  into  pro 
positions  on  the  possible  relative  position  of  practically 
rigid  bodies.1  Geometry  which  has  been  supplemented 
in  this  way  is  then  to  be  treated  as  a  branch  of  physics. 
We  can  now  legitimately  ask  as  to  the  "  truth  "  of 
geometrical  propositions  interpreted  in  this  way,  since 
we  are  justified  in  asking  whether  these  propositions 
are  satisfied  for  those  real  things  we  have  associated 
with  the  geometrical  ideas.  In  less  exact  terms  we  can 
express  this  by  saying  that  by  the  "  truth  "  of  a  geo 
metrical  proposition  in  this  sense  we  understand  its 
validity  for  a  construction  with  ruler  and  compasses. 
1  It  follows  that  a  natural  object  is  associated  also  with  a 
straight  line.  Three  points  A,  B  and  C  on  a  rigid  body  thus 
lie  in  a  straight  line  when,  the  points  A  and  C  being  given,  B 
is  chosen  such  that  the  sum  of  the  distances  AD  and  BC  is  as 
short  as  possible.  This  incomplete  suggestion  will  suffice  for 
our  present  purpose.
