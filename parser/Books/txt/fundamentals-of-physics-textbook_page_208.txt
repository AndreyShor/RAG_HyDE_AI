Substituting Eq. 8-5 into Eq. 8-1, we find that the change in potential energy
due to the change in configuration is, in general notation,
(8-6)
Gravitational Potential Energy
We first consider a particle with mass m moving vertically along a y axis (the
positive direction is upward). As the particle moves from point yi to point yf,
the gravitational force 
does work on it.To find the corresponding change in
the gravitational potential energy of the particle–Earth system, we use Eq. 8-6
with two changes: (1) We integrate along the y axis instead of the x axis, because
the gravitational force acts vertically.(2) We substitute $mg for the force symbol F,
because 
has the magnitude mg and is directed down the y axis.We then have
which yields
%U ! mg(yf $ yi) ! mg %y.
(8-7)
Only changes %U in gravitational potential energy (or any other type of
potential energy) are physically meaningful. However, to simplify a calculation or
a discussion, we sometimes would like to say that a certain gravitational potential
value U is associated with a certain particle–Earth system when the particle is at
a certain height y.To do so, we rewrite Eq. 8-7 as
U $ Ui ! mg(y $ yi).
(8-8)
Then we take Ui to be the gravitational potential energy of the system when it is
in a reference configuration in which the particle is at a reference point yi.
Usually we take Ui ! 0 and yi ! 0. Doing this changes Eq. 8-8 to
U(y) ! mgy
(gravitational potential energy).
(8-9)
This equation tells us:

POTENTIAL ENERGY AND CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
Elastic Potential Energy
We next consider the block–spring system shown in Fig. 8-3, with the block
moving on the end of a spring of spring constant k. As the block moves from
point xi to point xf, the spring force Fx ! $kx does work on the block.To find the
corresponding change in the elastic potential energy of the block–spring system,
we substitute $kx for F(x) in Eq. 8-6.We then have
or
(8-10)
To associate a potential energy value U with the block at position x, we
choose the reference configuration to be when the spring is at its relaxed length
and the block is at xi ! 0. Then the elastic potential energy Ui is 0, and Eq. 8-10

The gravitational potential energy associated with a particle–Earth system
depends only on the vertical position y (or height) of the particle relative to the
reference position y ! 0, not on the horizontal position.
