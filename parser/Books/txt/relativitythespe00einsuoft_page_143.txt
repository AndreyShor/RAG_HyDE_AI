sun  would  describe  an  ellipse  round  the  latter,  or,  more 
correctly,  round  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  the 
sun  and  the  planet.  In  such  a  system,  the  sun,  or  the 
common  centre  of  gravity,  lies  in  one  of  the  foci  of  the 
orbital  ellipse  in  such  a  manner  that,  in  the  course  of  a 
planet-year,  the  distance  sun-planet  grows  from  a 
minimum  to  a  maximum,  and  then  decreases  again  to 
a  minimum.  If  instead  of  Newton's  law  we  insert  a 
somewhat  different  law  of  attraction  into  the  calcula 
tion,  we  find  that,  according  to  this  new  law,  the  motion 
would  still  take  place  in  such  a  manner  that  the  distance 
sun-planet  exhibits  periodic  variations  ;  but  in  this 
case  the  angle  described  by  the  line  joining  sun  and 
planet  during  such  a  period  (from  perihelion  —  closest 
proximity  to  the  sun  —  to  perihelion)  would  differ  from 
360°.  The  line  of  the  orbit  would  not  then  be  a  closed 
one,  but  in  the  course  of  time  it  would  fill  up  an  annular 
part  of  the  orbital  plane,  viz.  between  the  circle  of 
least  and  the  circle  of  greatest  distance  of  the  planet  from 
the  sun. 
According  also  to  the  general  theory  of  relativity, 
which  differs  of  course  from  the  theory  of  Newton,  a 
small  variation  from  the  Newton-Kepler  motion  of  a 
planet  in  its  orbit  should  take  place,  and  in  such  a  way, 
that  the  angle  described  by  the  radius  sun-planet 
between  one  perihelion  and  the  next  should  exceed  that 
corresponding  to  one  complete  revolution  by  an  amount 
given  by 
(N.B.  —  One  complete  revolution  corresponds  to  the 
angle  2?,-  in  the  absolute  angular  measure  customary  in 
physics,  and  the  above  expression  gives  the  amount  by
