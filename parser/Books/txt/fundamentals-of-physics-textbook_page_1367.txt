tion (it involves the strong force) because all the particles involved are
hadrons.
Let us check whether electric charge is conserved in the reaction.To do so,
we can write the electric charge of a particle as qe, in which q is a charge
quantum number. Then determining whether electric charge is conserved in
a process amounts to determining whether the initial net charge quantum
number is equal to the final net charge quantum number. In the process of
Eq. 44-6, the initial net charge number is 1 ' (#1), or 0, and the final net
charge number is 4(1) ' 4(#1), or 0.Thus, charge is conserved.
For the energy balance, note from above that the energy available from
the p-p¯ annihilation process is at least the sum of the proton and antiproton
rest energies, 1876.6 MeV.The rest energy of a pion is 139.6 MeV, which means
the rest energies of the eight pions amount to 8 " 139.6 MeV, or 1116.8 MeV.
This leaves at least about 760 MeV to distribute among the eight pions as
kinetic energy.Thus, the requirement of energy conservation is easily met.
2. Pion Decay.
Pions are unstable particles and decay with a mean lifetime of
2.6 " 10#8 s.At point 2 in Fig. 44-2b, one of the positive pions comes to rest in
the chamber and decays spontaneously into an antimuon m' (purple track)
and a neutrino n:
(44-7)
The neutrino, being uncharged, leaves no track. Both the antimuon and
the neutrino are leptons; that is, they are particles on which the strong force
does not act. Thus, the decay process of Eq. 44-7, which is governed by
the weak force, is described as a weak interaction.
Let’s consider the energies in the decay. From Table 44-1, the rest energy
of an antimuon is 105.7 MeV and the rest energy of a neutrino is approxi-
mately 0. Because the pion is at rest when it decays, its energy is just its rest en-
ergy, 139.6 MeV. Thus, an energy of 139.6 MeV # 105.7 MeV, or 33.9 MeV, is
available to share between the antimuon and the neutrino as kinetic energy.
Let us check whether spin angular momentum is conserved in the
process of Eq. 44-7. This amounts to determining whether the net compo-
nent Sz of spin angular momentum along some arbitrary z axis can be con-
served by the process. The spin quantum numbers s of the particles in the
process are 0 for the pion p' and for both the antimuon m' and the neu-
trino n.Thus, for p', the component Sz must be 
, and for m' and n, it can be
either 
or 
.
The net component Sz is conserved by the process of Eq. 44-7 if there is
any way in which the initial 
can be equal to the final net Sz. We see

that if one of the products, either m' or n, has 
and the other has
, then their final net value is 
. Thus, because Sz can be conserved,
the decay process of Eq. 44-7 can occur.
From Eq. 44-7, we also see that the net charge is conserved by the process:
before the process the net charge quantum number is '1, and after the
process it is '1 ' 0 ! '1.
3. Muon Decay.
Muons (whether m# or m') are also unstable, decaying with
a mean life of 2.2 " 10#6 s. Although the decay products are not shown in
Fig. 44-2, the antimuon produced in the reaction of Eq. 44-7 comes to rest and
decays spontaneously according to
(44-8)
The rest energy of the antimuon is 105.7 MeV, and that of the positron is only
0.511 MeV, leaving 105.2 MeV to be shared as kinetic energy among the three
particles produced in the decay process of Eq. 44-8.
You may wonder: Why two neutrinos in Eq. 44-8? Why not just one, as in
the pion decay in Eq. 44-7? One answer is that the spin quantum numbers of the
