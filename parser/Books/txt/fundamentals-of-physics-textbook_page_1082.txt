Angle. We can specify where each bright fringe and each dark fringe is
located on the screen by giving the angle u from the central axis to that fringe.To
find u, we must relate it to 2L.We start with Fig. 35-10a by finding a point b along
ray r1 such that the path length from b to P equals the path length from S2 to P.
Then the path length difference 2L between the two rays is the distance from
S1 to b.
The relation between this S1-to-b distance and u is complicated, but we can
simplify it considerably if we arrange for the distance D from the slits to the
screen to be much greater than the slit separation d. Then we can approximate
rays r1 and r2 as being parallel to each other and at angle u to the central axis
(Fig. 35-10b). We can also approximate the triangle formed by S1, S2, and b as
being a right triangle, and approximate the angle inside that triangle at S2 as
being u.Then, for that triangle, sin u ! 2L/d and thus
2L ! d sin u
(path length difference).
(35-12)
For a bright fringe, we saw that 2L must be either zero or an integer number of
wavelengths. Using Eq. 35-12, we can write this requirement as
2L ! d sin u ! (integer)(l),
(35-13)
or as
d sin u ! ml,
for m ! 0, 1, 2, . . .
(maxima—bright fringes).
(35-14)
For a dark fringe, 2L must be an odd multiple of half a wavelength. Again using
Eq. 35-12, we can write this requirement as
(35-15)
or as
(minima—dark fringes). (35-16)
With Eqs. 35-14 and 35-16, we can find the angle u to any fringe and thus
locate that fringe; further, we can use the values of m to label the fringes. For
the value and label m ! 0, Eq. 35-14 tells us that a bright fringe is at u ! 0
and thus on the central axis. This central maximum is the point at which waves
arriving from the two slits have a path length difference 2L ! 0, hence zero
phase difference.
For, say, m ! 2, Eq. 35-14 tells us that bright fringes are at the angle
above and below the central axis. Waves from the two slits arrive at these two
fringes with 2L ! 2l and with a phase difference of two wavelengths. These
fringes are said to be the second-order bright fringes (meaning m ! 2) or the
second side maxima (the second maxima to the side of the central maximum), or

CHAPTER 35
INTERFERENCE
What appears at each point on the viewing screen in a Young’s double-slit
interference experiment is determined by the path length difference 2L of the
rays reaching that point.
point P is part of a bright fringe. When, instead, 2L is an odd multiple of half a
wavelength, the waves arrive at the common point exactly out of phase and they
interfere fully destructively there. If that is true for the waves of rays r1 and r2,
then point P is part of a dark fringe. (And, of course, we can have intermediate
situations of interference and thus intermediate illumination at P.) Thus,
