Interference of Waves
•31
Two identical traveling waves, moving in the same di-
rection, are out of phase by p/2 rad. What is the amplitude of the
resultant wave in terms of the common amplitude ym of the two
combining waves?
•32
What phase difference between two identical traveling
waves, moving in the same direction along a stretched string, re-
sults in the combined wave having an amplitude 1.50 times that of
the common amplitude of the two combining waves? Express
your answer in (a) degrees, (b) radians, and (c) wavelengths.
••33
Two sinusoidal waves with
the same amplitude of 9.00 mm and
the same wavelength travel together
along a string that is stretched along
an x axis. Their resultant wave is
shown twice in Fig. 16-38, as valley A
travels in the negative direction of
the x axis by distance d # 56.0 cm in
8.0 ms.The tick marks along the axis
are separated by 10 cm, and height
H is 8.0 mm. Let the equation for
one wave be of the form y(x, t) # ym sin(kx ! vt " f1), where 
f1 # 0 and you must choose the correct sign in front of v. For the
equation for the other wave, what are (a) ym, (b) k, (c) v, (d) f2,
and (e) the sign in front of v?
•••34
A sinusoidal wave of angular frequency 1200 rad/s
and amplitude 3.00 mm is sent along a cord with linear density
2.00 g/m and tension 1200 N. (a) What is the average rate at
SSM
••37
These two waves travel along the same string:
y1(x, t) # (4.60 mm) sin(2px $ 400pt)
y2(x, t) # (5.60 mm) sin(2px $ 400pt " 0.80p rad).
What are (a) the amplitude and (b) the phase angle (relative to
wave 1) of the resultant wave? (c) If a third wave of amplitude
5.00 mm is also to be sent along the string in the same direction as
the first two waves, what should be its phase angle in order to
maximize the amplitude of the new resultant wave?
••38
Two sinusoidal waves of the same frequency are to be sent
in the same direction along a taut string. One wave has an ampli-
tude of 5.0 mm, the other 8.0 mm. (a) What phase difference f1 be-
tween the two waves results in the smallest amplitude of the result-
ant wave? (b) What is that smallest amplitude? (c) What phase
difference f2 results in the largest amplitude of the resultant
wave? (d) What is that largest amplitude? (e) What is the resultant
amplitude if the phase angle is (f1 $ f2)/2?
••39
Two sinusoidal waves of the same period, with amplitudes of
5.0 and 7.0 mm, travel in the same direction along a stretched
string; they produce a resultant wave with an amplitude of 9.0 mm.
The phase constant of the 5.0 mm wave is 0.What is the phase con-
stant of the 7.0 mm wave?

Standing Waves and Resonance
•40
Two sinusoidal waves with identical wavelengths and
amplitudes travel in opposite directions along a string with a speed
of 10 cm/s. If the time interval between instants when the string is
flat is 0.50 s, what is the wavelength of the waves?
•41
A string fixed at both ends is 8.40 m long and has a
mass of 0.120 kg. It is subjected to a tension of 96.0 N and set oscil-
lating. (a) What is the speed of the waves on the string? (b) What is
the longest possible wavelength for a standing wave? (c) Give the
frequency of that wave.
•42
A string under tension ti oscillates in the third harmonic at fre-
quency f3, and the waves on the string have wavelength l3. If the ten-
sion is increased to tf # 4ti and the string is again made to oscillate in
the third harmonic, what then are (a) the frequency of oscillation in
terms of f3 and (b) the wavelength of the waves in terms of l3?
•43
What are (a) the lowest frequency, (b) the sec-
ond lowest frequency, and (c) the third lowest frequency for stand-
ing waves on a wire that is 10.0 m long, has a mass of 100 g, and is
stretched under a tension of 250 N?
•44
A 125 cm length of string has mass 2.00 g and tension 7.00 N.
(a) What is the wave speed for this string? (b) What is the lowest
resonant frequency of this string?
•45
A string that is stretched between fixed supports
separated by 75.0 cm has resonant frequencies of 420 and 315 Hz,
with no intermediate resonant frequencies.What are (a) the lowest
resonant frequency and (b) the wave speed?
•46
String A is stretched between two clamps separated by dis-
tance L. String B, with the same linear density and under the same
tension as string A, is stretched between two clamps separated by
distance 4L. Consider the first eight harmonics of string B. For
which of these eight harmonics of B (if any) does the frequency
match the frequency of (a) A’s first harmonic, (b) A’s second har-
monic, and (c) A’s third harmonic?
•47
One of the harmonic frequencies for a particular string under
tension is 325 Hz. The next higher harmonic frequency is 390 Hz.

direction:

cord? (b) If, simultaneously, an identical wave travels along an adja-
cent, identical cord, what is the total average rate at which energy is
transported to the opposite ends of the two cords by the waves? If, in-
stead, those two waves are sent along the same cord simultaneously,
what is the total average rate at which they transport energy when
their phase difference is (c) 0,(d) 0.4p rad,and (e) p rad?
