31-4 THE SERIES RLC CIRCUIT
The Series RLC Circuit
We are now ready to apply the alternating emf of Eq. 31-28,
# ! #m sin vdt
(applied emf),
(31-55)
to the full RLC circuit of Fig. 31-7. Because R, L, and C are in series, the same
current
i ! I sin(vdt ' f)
(31-56)
is driven in all three of them. We wish to find the current amplitude I and the
phase constant f and to investigate how these quantities depend on the driving
angular frequency vd.The solution is simplified by the use of phasor diagrams as
introduced for the three basic circuits of Module 31-3: capacitive load, inductive
load, and resistive load. In particular we shall make use of how the voltage phasor
is related to the current phasor for each of those basic circuits. We shall find that
series RLC circuits can be separated into three types: mainly capacitive circuits,
mainly inductive circuits, and circuits that are in resonance.
