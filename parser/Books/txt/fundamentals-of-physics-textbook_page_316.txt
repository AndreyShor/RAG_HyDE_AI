CHAPTER 10
ROTATION
••53
Figure 10-43 shows a uniform
disk that can rotate around its center like a
merry-go-round. The disk has a radius of
2.00 cm and a mass of 20.0 grams and is ini-
tially at rest. Starting at time t ! 0, two
forces are to be applied tangentially to the
rim as indicated, so that at time t ! 1.25 s
the disk has an angular velocity of 250
rad/s counterclockwise. Force 
has a magnitude of 0.100 N. What
is magnitude F2?

In a judo foot-sweep
move, you sweep your opponent’s
left foot out from under him while
pulling on his gi (uniform) toward
that side. As a result, your oppo-
nent rotates around his right foot
and onto the mat. Figure 10-44
shows a simplified diagram of
your opponent as you face him,
with his left foot swept out. The
rotational axis is through point O.
The gravitational force 
on him
effectively acts at his center of
mass, which is a horizontal dis-
tance d ! 28 cm from point O. His
mass is 70 kg, and his rotational in-
ertia about point O is 65 kg)m2.What is the magnitude of his initial
angular acceleration about point O if your pull 
on his gi is (a) neg-
ligible and (b) horizontal with a magnitude of 300 N and applied at
height h ! 1.4 m?

In Fig. 10-45a, an irregularly shaped plastic plate with
uniform thickness and density (mass per unit volume) is to be
rotated around an axle that is perpendicular to the plate face
and through point O. The rotational inertia of the plate about

block in Fig. 10-38 has mass 0.172 kg
and edge lengths a ! 3.5 cm, b ! 8.4
cm, and c ! 1.4 cm. Calculate its rota-
tional inertia about an axis through

Four identical particles of
mass 0.50 kg each are placed at the
vertices of a 2.0 m $ 2.0 m square
and held there by four massless rods, which form the sides of the
square. What is the rotational inertia of this rigid body about an
axis that (a) passes through the midpoints of opposite sides and
lies in the plane of the square, (b) passes through the midpoint of
one of the sides and is perpendicular to the plane of the square,
and (c) lies in the plane of the square and passes through two di-
agonally opposite particles?

the pulley. (a) What is the magnitude of the acceleration of the
blocks? What are (b) tension

its rotational inertia?

In Fig. 10-42, a cylinder having a mass of 2.0 kg can rotate
about its central axis through point O. Forces are applied as shown:
F1 ! 6.0 N, F2 ! 4.0 N, F3 ! 2.0 N, and F4 ! 5.0 N. Also, r ! 5.0 cm
and R ! 12 cm. Find the (a) magnitude and (b) direction of the an-
gular acceleration of the cylinder. (During the rotation, the forces
maintain their same angles relative to the cylinder.)

The body in
Fig. 10-39 is pivoted at O, and
two forces act on it as shown. If
r1 ! 1.30 m, r2 ! 2.15 m, F1 !
4.20 N, F2 ! 4.90 N, u1 ! 75.0#,
and u2 ! 60.0#, what is the net
torque about the pivot?

The body in Fig. 10-40 is
pivoted at O. Three forces act
on it: FA ! 10 N at point A, 8.0
m from O; FB ! 16 N at B, 4.0
m from O; and FC ! 19 N at C,
3.0 m from O. What is the net
torque about O?

speed about her center of mass changes from zero to 6.20 rad/s in 220
ms. Her rotational inertia about her center of mass is 12.0 kg)m2.
