Now let us integrate each term of this equation between an arbitrary initial state
i and an arbitrary final state f to get
The quantity on the left is the entropy change %S (# Sf $ Si) defined by Eq. 20-1.
Substituting this and integrating the quantities on the right yield
(20-4)
Note that we did not have to specify a particular reversible process when we
integrated. Therefore, the integration must hold for all reversible processes that
take the gas from state i to state f. Thus, the change in entropy %S between the
initial and final states of an ideal gas depends only on properties of the initial
state (Vi and Ti) and properties of the final state (Vf and Tf); %S does not depend
on how the gas changes between the two states.

Checkpoint 2
An ideal gas has temperature T1 at the initial state i shown in the p-V diagram here.The
gas has a higher temperature T2 at final states a and b, which it can reach along the paths
shown. Is the entropy change along the path to state a larger than, smaller than, or the
same as that along the path to state b?

Entropy change of two blocks coming to thermal equilibrium
Figure 20-5a shows two identical copper blocks of mass
m
1.5 kg: block L at temperature TiL # 60 C and block
R at temperature TiR # 20-C.The blocks are in a thermally
insulated box and are separated by an insulating shutter.
When we lift the shutter, the blocks eventually come to the
equilibrium temperature Tf # 40-C (Fig. 20-5b). What is
the net entropy change of the two-block system during
this irreversible process? The specific heat of copper is
386 J/kg9K.
KEY IDEA
To calculate the entropy change, we must find a reversible
process that takes the system from the initial state of Fig.20-5a
to the final state of Fig. 20-5b. We can calculate the net en-
tropy change %Srev of the reversible process using Eq. 20-1,
and then the entropy change for the irreversible process is
equal to %Srev.
Calculations: For the reversible process, we need a thermal
reservoir whose temperature can be changed slowly (say, by
turning a knob). We then take the blocks through the fol-
lowing two steps, illustrated in Fig. 20-6.
Step 1: With the reservoirâ€™s temperature set at 60 C, put
block L on the reservoir. (Since block and reservoir are at
the same temperature, they are already in thermal equilib-

Figure 20-5 (a) In the initial state, two copper blocks L and R, iden-
tical except for their temperatures, are in an insulating box and
are separated by an insulating shutter. (b) When the shutter is
removed, the blocks exchange energy as heat and come to a final
state, both with the same temperature Tf.
Figure 20-6 The blocks of Fig. 20-5 can proceed from their initial
state to their final state in a reversible way if we use a reservoir
with a controllable temperature (a) to extract heat reversibly
from block L and (b) to add heat reversibly to block R.
