wave at P0 is the vector sum of these phasors. This arrangement of the phasors
turns out to be the one that gives the greatest value for the amplitude Eu.We call
this value Em; that is, Em is the value of Eu for u ! 0.
We next consider a point P that is at a small angle u to the central axis.
Equation 36-4 now tells us that the phase difference 2f between wavelets from
adjacent zones is no longer zero. Figure 36-7b shows the corresponding phasor
diagram; as before, the phasors are arranged head to tail, but now there is an
angle 2f between adjacent phasors.The amplitude Eu at this new point is still the
vector sum of the phasors, but it is smaller than that in Fig. 36-7a, which means
that the intensity of the light is less at this new point P than at P0.
First Minimun. If we continue to increase u,the angle 2f between adjacent pha-
sors increases,and eventually the chain of phasors curls completely around so that the
head of the last phasor just reaches the tail of the first phasor (Fig. 36-7c).The ampli-

Here, with an even larger
phase difference, they add
to give a small amplitude
and thus a small intensity.
The last phasor is out of
phase with the first phasor
by 2   rad (full circle).
Here, with a larger phase
difference, the phasors add
to give zero amplitude and
thus a minimum in the pattern.
Here the phasors have a small
phase difference and add to give
a smaller amplitude and thus
less intensity in the pattern.
The phasors from the 18 zones
in the slit are in phase and add
to give a maximum amplitude
and thus the central maximum
in the diffraction pattern.
