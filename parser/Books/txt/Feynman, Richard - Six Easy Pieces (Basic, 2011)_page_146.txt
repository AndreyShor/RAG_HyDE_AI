QUANTUM BEHAVIOR
Atomic mechanics
In the last few chapters we have treated the essential ideas nec-
essary for an understanding of most of the important phenom-
ena of light—or electromagnetic radiation in general. (We have left
a few special topics for next year. Speciﬁcally, the theory of the
index of dense materials and total internal reﬂection.) What we
have dealt with is called the “classical theory” of electric waves,
which turns out to be a completely adequate description of nature
for a large number of effects. We have not had to worry yet about
the fact that light energy comes in lumps or “photons.”
We would like to take up as our next subject the problem of the
behavior of relatively large pieces of matter—their mechanical and
thermal properties, for instance. In discussing these, we will ﬁnd
that the “classical” (or older) theory fails almost immediately, be-
cause matter is really made up of atomic-sized particles. Still, we
will deal only with the classical part, because that is the only part
that we can understand using the classical mechanics we have been
learning. But we shall not be very successful. We shall ﬁnd that in
the case of matter, unlike the case of light, we shall be in difficulty
relatively soon. We could, of course, continuously skirt away from
the atomic effects, but we shall instead interpose here a short ex-
cursion in which we will describe the basic ideas of the quantum
properties of matter, i.e., the quantum ideas of atomic physics, so
