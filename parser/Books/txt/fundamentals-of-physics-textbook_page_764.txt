Capacitor; Capacitance
A capacitor consists of two isolated
conductors (the plates) with charges %q and #q. Its capacitance C
is defined from
q ! CV,
(25-1)
where V is the potential difference between the plates.
Determining 
Capacitance
We generally determine the
capacitance of a particular capacitor configuration by (1) assuming a
charge q to have been placed on the plates,(2) finding the electric field
due to this charge,(3) evaluating the potential difference V,and (4)
calculating C from Eq.25-1.Some specific results are the following:
A parallel-plate capacitor with flat parallel plates of area A
and spacing d has capacitance
(25-9)
A cylindrical capacitor (two long coaxial cylinders) of length
L and radii a and b has capacitance
(25-14)
A spherical capacitor with concentric spherical plates of radii
a and b has capacitance
(25-17)
An isolated sphere of radius R has capacitance
C ! 4p´0R.
(25-18)
Capacitors in Parallel and in Series
The equivalent
capacitances Ceq of combinations of individual capacitors con-
nected in parallel and in series can be found from
(n capacitors in parallel)
(25-19)
and
(n capacitors in series).

Review & Summary
Equivalent capacitances can be used to calculate the capacitances
of more complicated series–parallel combinations.
Potential Energy and Energy Density
The electric poten-
tial energy U of a charged capacitor,
(25-21, 25-22)
is equal to the work required to charge the capacitor. This energy
can be associated with the capacitor’s electric field 
By extension
we can associate stored energy with any electric field. In vacuum,
the energy density u, or potential energy per unit volume, within an
electric field of magnitude E is given by
(25-25)
Capacitance with a Dielectric
If the space between the
plates of a capacitor is completely filled with a dielectric material,
the capacitance C is increased by a factor k, called the dielectric
constant, which is characteristic of the material. In a region that
is completely filled by a dielectric, all electrostatic equations con-
taining +0 must be modified by replacing +0 with k+0.
The effects of adding a dielectric can be understood physically
in terms of the action of an electric field on the permanent or
induced electric dipoles in the dielectric slab. The result is the for-
mation of induced charges on the surfaces of the dielectric, which
results in a weakening of the field within the dielectric for a given
amount of free charge on the plates.
Gauss’ Law with a Dielectric
When a dielectric is present,
Gauss’ law may be generalized to
(25-36)
Here q is the free charge; any induced surface charge is accounted
for by including the dielectric constant k inside the integral.
