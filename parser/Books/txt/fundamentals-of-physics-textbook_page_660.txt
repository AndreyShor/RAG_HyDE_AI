ELECTRIC FIELDS
Checkpoint 1
The figure here shows a proton p and an electron e on an x axis.What is the direction of
the electric field due to the electron at (a) point
S and (b) point R? What is the direction of the
net electric field at (c) point R and (d) point S?

Sample Problem 22.01
Net electric field due to three charged particles
Figure 22-7a shows three particles with charges q1 ! #2Q,
q2 ! %2Q, and q3 ! %4Q, each a distance d from the origin.
What net electric field 
is produced at the origin?
KEY IDEA
Charges q1, q2, and q3 produce electric field vectors 
and 
respectively, at the origin, and the net electric field
is the vector sum 
To find this sum, we
first must find the magnitudes and orientations of the three
field vectors.
Magnitudes and directions: To find the magnitude of 
which is due to q1, we use Eq. 22-3, substituting d for r and
2Q for q and obtaining
Similarly, we find the magnitudes of  
and 
to be

quantity at the point where the tail of the arrow is anchored. The vector is not
something that stretches from a “here” to a “there” as with a displacement vector.
In general, if several electric fields are set up at a given point by several
charged particles, we can find the net field by placing a positive test particle at
the point and then writing out the force acting on it due to each particle, such
as 
due to particle 1. Forces obey the principle of superposition, so we just
add the forces as vectors:
To change over to electric field, we repeatedly use Eq. 22-1 for each of the indi-
vidual forces:
(22-4)
This tells us that electric fields also obey the principle of superposition. If you want
the net electric field at a given point due to several particles, find the electric field
due to each particle (such as 
due to particle 1) and then sum the fields as vectors.
(As with electrostatic forces, you cannot just willy-nilly add up the magnitudes.)
This addition of fields is the subject of many of the homework problems.
