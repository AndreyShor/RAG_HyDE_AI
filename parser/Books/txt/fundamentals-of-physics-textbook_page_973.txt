32-3 DISPLACEMENT CURRENT
Displacement Current
If you compare the two terms on the right side of Eq. 32-5, you will see that the
product ´0(d#E/dt) must have the dimension of a current. In fact, that product has
been treated as being a fictitious current called the displacement current id:
(displacement current).
(32-10)
“Displacement” is poorly chosen in that nothing is being displaced, but we are
stuck with the word. Nevertheless, we can now rewrite Eq. 32-5 as
(Ampere–Maxwell law),
(32-11)
in which id,enc is the displacement current that is encircled by the integration loop.
Let us again focus on a charging capacitor with circular plates, as in
Fig. 32-7a.The real current i that is charging the plates changes the electric field 
between the plates. The fictitious displacement current id between the plates is
associated with that changing field . Let us relate these two currents.
The charge q on the plates at any time is related to the magnitude E of the
field between the plates at that time and the plate area A by Eq. 25-4:
q ! ´0AE.
(32-12)
To get the real current i,we differentiate Eq.32-12 with respect to time,finding
(32-13)
To get the displacement current id, we can use Eq. 32-10.Assuming that the elec-
tric field 
between the two plates is uniform (we neglect any fringing), we can

Before charging, there
is no magnetic field.
After charging, there
is no magnetic field.
During charging, magnetic 
field is created by both 
the real and fictional currents. 
During charging, the 
right-hand rule works for both 
the real and fictional currents.

Figure 32-7 (a) Before and (d) after the plates
are charged, there is no magnetic field. (b)
During the charging, magnetic field is created
by both the real current and the (fictional)
displacement current. (c) The same right-
hand rule works for both currents to give the
direction of the magnetic field.
