Two bodies have undergone an
elastic 
one-dimensional 
collision
along an x axis. Figure 9-31 is a graph
of position versus time for those
bodies and for their center of mass.
(a) Were both bodies initially moving,
or was one initially stationary? Which
line segment corresponds to the mo-
tion of the center of mass (b) before the collision and (c) after the col-
lision? (d) Is the mass of the body that was moving faster before the
collision greater than,less than,or equal to that of the other body?

stationary, sliding in the positive direction of an x axis, or sliding in

the negative direction of that axis. Then the block explodes into
two pieces that slide along the x axis. Assume the block and the
two pieces form a closed, isolated system. Six choices for a graph of
the momenta of the block and the pieces are given, all versus time
t. Determine which choices represent physically impossible situa-
tions and explain why.

Block 1 with mass m1 slides
along an x axis across a frictionless
floor and then undergoes an elastic
collision with a stationary block 2 with
mass m2. Figure 9-33 shows a plot of
position x versus time t of block 1 until
the collision occurs at position xc and
time tc.In which of the lettered regions
on the graph will the plot be contin-
ued (after the collision) if (a) m1 + m2
and (b) m1 - m2? (c) Along which of
the numbered dashed lines will the
plot be continued if m1 ! m2?

Figure 9-34 shows four graphs of
position versus time for two bodies
and their center of mass. The two
bodies form a closed, isolated system
and undergo a completely inelastic,
one-dimensional collision on an x axis.
In graph 1, are (a) the two bodies and
(b) the center of mass moving in the
positive or negative direction of the x
axis? (c) Which of the graphs corre-
spond to a physically impossible situ-
ation? Explain.

Module 9-1
Center of Mass
•1
A 2.00 kg particle has the xy coordinates (%1.20 m, 0.500 m),
and a 4.00 kg particle has the xy coordinates (0.600 m, %0.750 m).
Both lie on a horizontal plane. At what (a) x and (b) y coordinates
must you place a 3.00 kg particle such that the center of mass of the
three-particle system has the coor-
dinates (%0.500 m,%0.700 m)?

Figure 9-35 shows a three-par-
ticle system, with masses m1 ! 3.0
kg, m2 ! 4.0 kg, and m3 ! 8.0 kg.
The scales on the axes are set by
xs ! 2.0 m and ys ! 2.0 m.What are
(a) the x coordinate and (b) the y
coordinate of the system’s center
of mass? (c) If m3 is gradually in-
creased, does the center of mass of the system shift toward or away
from that particle, or does it remain stationary?
