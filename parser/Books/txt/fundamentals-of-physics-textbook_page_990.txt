CHAPTER 32
MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS; MAGNETISM OF MATTER
Next, we can rewrite Eq. 32-43 in terms of the needle’s mass
m, the molar mass M, and Avogadro’s number NA:
(32-45)
The needle’s mass m is the product of its density and its 
volume.The volume works out to be 1.5 & 10'8 m3; so

Sample Problem 32.04
Magnetic dipole moment of a compass needle
A compass needle made of pure iron (density 7900 kg/m3)
has a length L of 3.0 cm, a width of 1.0 mm, and a thickness
of 0.50 mm. The magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment
of an iron atom is mFe ! 2.1 & 10'23 J/T. If the magnetiza-
tion of the needle is equivalent to the alignment of 10% of
the atoms in the needle, what is the magnitude of the nee-
dle’s magnetic dipole moment ?
KEY IDEAS
(1) Alignment of all N atoms in the needle would give a
magnitude of NmFe for the needle’s magnetic dipole mo-
ment . However, the needle has only 10% alignment (the
random orientation of the rest does not give any net contri-
bution to ).Thus,
m ! 0.10NmFe.
(32-42)
(2) We can find the number of atoms N in the needle from
the needle’s mass:
.
(32-43)
Finding N: Iron’s atomic mass is not listed in Appendix F,
but its molar mass M is.Thus, we write

current ienc encircled by a closed loop. Maxwell’s law and Ampere’s
law can be written as the single equation
(Ampere–Maxwell law). (32-5)
Displacement Current
We define the fictitious displacement
current due to a changing electric field as
(32-10)
Equation 32-5 then becomes

Gauss’ Law for Magnetic Fields
The simplest magnetic
structures are magnetic dipoles. Magnetic monopoles do not exist
(as far as we know). Gauss’ law for magnetic fields,
(32-1)
states that the net magnetic flux through any (closed) Gaussian
surface is zero. It implies that magnetic monopoles do not exist.
Maxwell’s Extension of Ampere’s Law
A changing elec-
tric flux induces a magnetic field . Maxwell’s law,
(Maxwell’s law of induction),
(32-3)
relates the magnetic field induced along a closed loop to the
changing electric flux #E through the loop. Ampere’s law,

Review & Summary
ferromagnetic material in nearby rock. Because of hysteresis, such rock
material retains some of that magnetization after the lightning strike (after the
currents disappear). Pieces of the rock—later exposed, broken, and loosened by
weathering—are then lodestones.
 needle’s mass m ! (needle’s density)(needle’s volume)
Substituting into Eq. 32-45 with this value for m, and also
55.847 g/mol (! 0.055 847 kg/mol) for M and 6.02 & 1023 for
NA, we find
Finding m: Substituting our value of N and the value of mFe
into Eq. 32-42 then yields
