40     SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
In  accordance  with  the  principle  of  relativity  we  shall 
certainly  have  to  take  for  granted  that  the  propagation 
of  light  always  takes  place  with  the  same  velocity  w 
with  respect  to  the  liquid,  whether  the  latter  is  in  motion 
with  reference  to  other  bodies  or  not.  The  velocity 
of  light  relative  to  the  liquid  and  the  velocity  of  the 
latter  relative  to  the  tube  are  thus  known,  and  we 
require  the  velocity  of  light  relative  to  the  tube. 
It  is  clear  that  we  have  the  problem  of  Section  VI 
again  before  us.  The  tube  plays  the  part  of  the  railway 
embankment  or  of  the  co-ordinate  system  K,  the  liquid 
plays  the  part  of  the  carriage  or  of  the  co-ordinate 
system  K',  and  finally,  the  light  plays  the  part  of  the

man  walking  along  the  carriage,  or  of  the  moving  point 
in  the  present  section.  If  we  denote  the  velocity  of  the 
light  relative  to  the  tube  by  W,  then  this  is  given 
by  the  equation  (A)  or  (B),  according  as  the  Galilei 
transformation  or  the  Lorentz  transformation  corre 
sponds  to  the  facts.  Experiment l  decides  in  favour 
of  equation  (B)  derived  from  the  theory  of  relativity,  and 
the  agreement  is,  indeed,  very  exact.  According  to 
1  Fizeau  found  W  =  w+v(  i  — 11,  where  n=-  is  the  index  of 
refraction  of  the  liquid.     On  the  other  hand,  owing  to  the  small- 
ness  of  —5  as  compared  with  i,  we  can  replace  (B)  in  the  first 
c 
place  by  W  =  (w  +v)(  i  -  -  V  or  to  the  same  order  of  approxima 
tion  by  w  +v(  i  — 2  j,  which  agrees  with  Fizeau's  result.
