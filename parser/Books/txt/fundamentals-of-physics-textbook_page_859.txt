In Fig. 28-51a, two concentric coils, lying in the same
plane, carry currents in opposite directions. The current in the
larger coil 1 is fixed. Current i2 in coil 2 can be varied. Figure 28-51b
gives the net magnetic moment of the two-coil system as a function
of i2. The vertical axis scale is set by

the horizontal axis scale is set by i2s

coil 2 is then reversed, what is the magnitude of the net magnetic
moment of the two-coil system when i2 ! 7.0 mA?
