17-3 INTERFERENCE
From Eq. 17-21, this occurs when the ratio %L/l is
# 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, . . .
(fully destructive interference).
(17-25)
For example, if the path length difference %L # |L2 $ L1| in Fig. 17-7a is equal to
2.5l, then %L/l # 2.5 and the waves undergo fully destructive interference at
point P (Fig. 17-7c). The interference is fully destructive because the wave from
S2 is phase-shifted relative to the wave from S1 by 2.5 wavelengths, which puts the
two waves exactly out of phase at P.
Of course, two waves could produce intermediate interference as, say, when
%L/l # 1.2. This would be closer to fully constructive interference (%L/l # 1.0)
than to fully destructive interference (%L/l # 1.5).
%L
l
Reasoning: The wave from S1 travels the extra distance D
(# 1.5l) to reach P2.Thus,the path length difference is
%L # 1.5l.
(Answer)
From Eq. 17-25, this means that the waves are exactly out
of phase at P2 and undergo fully destructive interference
there.
(c) Figure 17-8d shows a circle with a radius much greater
than D, centered on the midpoint between sources S1 and S2.
What is the number of points N around this circle at which
the interference is fully constructive? (That is, at how many
points do the waves arrive exactly in phase?)
Reasoning: Starting at point a, let’s move clockwise
along the circle to point d. As we move, path length differ-
ence %L increases and so the type of interference changes.
From (a), we know that is %L # 0l at point a. From (b),
we know that %L # 1.5l at point d. Thus, there must be
Sample Problem 17.02
Interference points along a big circle
In Fig. 17-8a, two point sources S1 and S2, which are in phase
and separated by distance D # 1.5l, emit identical sound
waves of wavelength l.
(a) What is the path length difference of the waves from S1
and S2 at point P1, which lies on the perpendicular bisector
of distance D, at a distance greater than D from the sources
(Fig. 17-8b)? (That is, what is the difference in the distance
from source S1 to point P1 and the distance from source S2
to P1?) What type of interference occurs at P1?
Reasoning: Because the waves travel identical distances to
reach P1, their path length difference is
%L # 0.
(Answer)
From Eq. 17-23, this means that the waves undergo fully
constructive interference at P1 because they start in phase at
the sources and reach P1 in phase.
(b) What are the path length difference and type of inter-
ference at point P2 in Fig. 17-8c?

The difference in these
path lengths equals 0.
The difference in these
path lengths is D,
which equals 1.5  .
Thus, the waves arrive exactly
in phase and undergo fully
constructive interference.
Thus, the waves arrive
exactly out of phase 
and undergo fully
destructive interference.
