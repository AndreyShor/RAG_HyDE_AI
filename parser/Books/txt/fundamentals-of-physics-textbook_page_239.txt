Fasten one end of a vertical spring to a ceiling, attach a cab-
bage to the other end, and then slowly lower the cabbage until the
upward force on it from the spring balances the gravitational force
on it. Show that the loss of gravitational potential energy of the
cabbage–Earth system equals twice the gain in the spring’s poten-
tial energy.

The maximum force you can exert on an object with one of
your back teeth is about 750 N. Suppose that as you gradually bite
on a clump of licorice, the licorice resists compression by one of
your teeth by acting like a spring for which k ! 2.5 $ 105 N/m. Find
(a) the distance the licorice is compressed by your tooth and
(b) the work the tooth does on the licorice during the compression.
(c) Plot the magnitude of your force versus the compression 
distance. (d) If there is a potential energy associated with this com-
pression, plot it versus compression distance.
In the 1990s the pelvis of a particular Triceratops dinosaur was
found to have deep bite marks. The shape of the marks suggested
that they were made by a Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaur. To test the
idea, researchers made a replica of a T. rex tooth from bronze and
aluminum and then used a hydraulic press to gradually drive the
replica into cow bone to the depth seen in the Triceratops bone. A
graph of the force required versus depth of penetration is given in
Fig. 8-71 for one trial; the required force increased with depth be-
cause, as the nearly conical tooth penetrated the bone, more of the
tooth came in contact with the bone. (e) How much work was done
by the hydraulic press—and thus presumably by the T. rex—in
such a penetration? (f) Is there a potential energy associated with
this penetration? (The large biting force and energy expenditure
attributed to the T. rex by this research suggest that the animal was
a predator and not a scavenger.)

Conservative force F(x)
acts on a particle that moves
along an x axis. Figure 8-72
shows how the potential energy
U(x) associated with force F(x)
varies with the position of the
particle, (a) Plot F(x) for the
range 0 + x + 6 m. (b) The me-
chanical energy E of the system
is 4.0 J. Plot the kinetic energy
K(x) of the particle directly on
Fig. 8-72.

Figure 8-73a shows a mol-
ecule consisting of two atoms of
masses m and M (with m
M)
and separation r. Figure 8-73b
shows the potential energy U(r)
of the molecule as a function of
r. Describe the motion of the
atoms (a) if the total mechanical
energy E of the two-atom sys-
tem is greater than zero (as is
E1), and (b) if E is less than zero
(as is E2). For E1 ! 1 $ 10%19 J
and r ! 0.3 nm, find (c) the po-
tential energy of the system, (d)
the total kinetic energy of the
atoms, and (e) the force (magni-
tude and direction) acting on
each atom. For what values of r
is the force (f) repulsive, (g) at-
tractive,and (h) zero?

Repeat Problem 83, but now with the block accelerated up a
frictionless plane inclined at 5.0# to the horizontal.

A spring with spring constant k ! 620 N/m is placed in a ver-
tical orientation with its lower end supported by a horizontal sur-
face. The upper end is depressed 25 cm, and a block with a weight
of 50 N is placed (unattached) on the depressed spring.The system
is then released from rest. Assume that the gravitational potential
energy Ug of the block is zero at the release point (y ! 0) and cal-
culate the kinetic energy K of the block for y equal to (a) 0,
(b) 0.050 m, (c) 0.10 m, (d) 0.15 m, and (e) 0.20 m.Also, (f) how far
above its point of release does the block rise?
