REVIEW & SUMMARY
Thermal Expansion
All objects change size with changes in tem-
perature. For a temperature change %T, a change %L in any linear
dimension L is given by
%L # La %T,
(18-9)
in which a is the coefficient of linear expansion. The change %V in
the volume V of a solid or liquid is
%V # Vb %T.
(18-10)
Here b # 3a is the material’s coefficient of volume expansion.
Heat
Heat Q is energy that is transferred between a system and
its environment because of a temperature difference between
them. It can be measured in joules (J), calories (cal), kilocalories
(Cal or kcal), or British thermal units (Btu), with
1 cal # 3.968 ' 10$3 Btu # 4.1868 J.
(18-12)
Heat Capacity and Specific Heat
If heat Q is absorbed by
an object, the object’s temperature change Tf $ Ti is related to Q by
Q # C(Tf $ Ti),
(18-13)
in which C is the heat capacity of the object. If the object has mass
m, then
Q # cm(Tf $ Ti),
(18-14)
where c is the specific heat of the material making up the object.
The molar specific heat of a material is the heat capacity
per mole, which means per 6.02 ' 10 23 elementary units of the
material.
Heat of Transformation
Matter can exist in three common
states: solid, liquid, and vapor. Heat absorbed by a material may
change the material’s physical state—for example, from solid to liq-
uid or from liquid to gas.The amount of energy required per unit mass
to change the state (but not the temperature) of a particular material
is its heat of transformation L.Thus,
Q # Lm.
(18-16)
The heat of vaporization LV is the amount of energy per unit mass
that must be added to vaporize a liquid or that must be removed to
condense a gas. The heat of fusion LF is the amount of energy per
unit mass that must be added to melt a solid or that must be re-
moved to freeze a liquid.
Work Associated with Volume Change
A gas may
exchange energy with its surroundings through work. The amount
of work W done by a gas as it expands or contracts from an initial
volume Vi to a final volume Vf is given by

W #" dW #"
Vf

p dV.
The integration is necessary because the pressure p may vary dur-
ing the volume change.
First Law of Thermodynamics
The principle of conser-
vation of energy for a thermodynamic process is expressed in the
first law of thermodynamics, which may assume either of the
forms
%Eint # Eint,f $ Eint,i # Q $ W
(first law)
(18-26)
or
dEint # dQ $ dW
(first law).
(18-27)
Eint represents the internal energy of the material, which depends
only on the material’s state (temperature, pressure, and volume).
Q represents the energy exchanged as heat between the system
and its surroundings; Q is positive if the system absorbs heat and
negative if the system loses heat. W is the work done by the sys-
tem; W is positive if the system expands against an external force
from the surroundings and negative if the system contracts be-
cause of an external force. Q and W are path dependent; %Eint is
path independent.
Applications of the First Law
The first law of thermody-
namics finds application in several special cases:
adiabatic processes:
Q # 0,
%Eint # $W
constant-volume processes:
W # 0,
%Eint # Q
cyclical processes:
%Eint # 0,
Q # W
free expansions:
Q # W # %Eint # 0
Conduction, Convection, and Radiation
The rate Pcond at
which energy is conducted through a slab for which one face is
maintained at the higher temperature TH and the other face is
maintained at the lower temperature TC is
(18-32)
Here each face of the slab has area A, the length of the slab (the
distance between the faces) is L, and k is the thermal conductivity
of the material.
Convection occurs when temperature differences cause an en-
ergy transfer by motion within a fluid.
Radiation is an energy transfer via the emission of electromag-
netic energy. The rate Prad at which an object emits energy via ther-
mal radiation is
Prad # s´AT 4,
(18-38)
where s (# 5.6704 ' 10$8 W/m29K4) is the Stefan–Boltzmann
constant, ´ is the emissivity of the object’s surface, A is its surface
area, and T is its surface temperature (in kelvins). The rate Pabs at
which an object absorbs energy via thermal radiation from its envi-
ronment, which is at the uniform temperature Tenv (in kelvins), is
Pabs # s´AT4
