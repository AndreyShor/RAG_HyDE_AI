GENERAL  RESULTS  OF  THEORY      45 
ic  kinetic  energy  of  a  material  point  of  mass  m  is  no

'his  expression  approaches  infinity  as  the  velocity  v 
pproaches  the  velocity  of  light  c.  The  velocity  must 
herefore  always  remain  less  than  c,  however  great  may

aechanics.  The  first  term  me2  does  not  contain 
he  velocity,  and  requires  no  consideration  if  we  are  only 
leaiing  with  the  question  as  to  how  the  energy  of  a 
>oint-mass  depends  on  the  velocity.  We  shall  speak 
)f  its  essential  significance  later. 
The  most  important  result  of  a  general  character  to 
vhich  the  special  theory  of  relativity  has  led  is  concerned 
vith  the  conception  of  mass.  Before  the  advent  of 
•elativity,  physics  recognised  two  conservation  laws  of 
'undamental  importance,  namely,  the  law  of  the  con 
servation  of  energy  and  the  law  of  the  conservation  of 
nass  ;  these  two  fundamental  laws  appeared  to  be  quite
