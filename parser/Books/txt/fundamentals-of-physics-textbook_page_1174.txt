Figure 37-27 is a graph of intensity versus wavelength for
light reaching Earth from galaxy NGC 7319, which is about 3 ( 108
light-years away.The most intense light is emitted by the oxygen in
NGC 7319. In a laboratory that emission is at wavelength l ! 513
nm, but in the light from NGC 7319 it has been shifted to 525 nm
due to the Doppler effect (all the emissions from NGC 7319 have
been shifted). (a) What is the radial speed of NGC 7319 relative to
Earth? (b) Is the relative motion toward or away from our planet?
121 MeV/c, what is the ratio m/me of its mass to the electron
mass?

A 5.00-grain aspirin tablet has a mass of 320 mg. For
how many kilometers would the energy equivalent of this mass
power an automobile? Assume 12.75 km/L and a heat of combus-
tion of 3.65 ( 107 J/L for the gasoline used in the automobile.
••48
The mass of a muon is 207 times the electron mass; the av-
erage lifetime of muons at rest is 2.20 ms. In a certain experiment,
muons moving through a laboratory are measured to have an aver-
age lifetime of 6.90 ms. For the moving muons, what are (a) b,
(b) K, and (c) p (in MeV/c)?
••49
As you read this page (on paper or monitor screen), a cos-
mic ray proton passes along the left–right width of the page with
relative speed v and a total energy of 14.24 nJ. According to your
measurements, that left–right width is 21.0 cm. (a) What is the
width according to the proton’s reference frame? How much time
did the passage take according to (b) your frame and (c) the pro-
ton’s frame?

To four significant figures, find the following when the
kinetic energy is 10.00 MeV: (a) g and (b) b for an electron (E0 !
0.510 998 MeV), (c) g and (d) b for a proton (E0 ! 938.272 MeV),
and (e) g and (f) b for an a particle (E0 ! 3727.40 MeV).
••51
What must be the momentum of a particle with mass m
so that the total energy of the particle is 3.00 times its rest energy?
••52
Apply the binomial theorem (Appendix E) to the last part
of Eq. 37-52 for the kinetic energy of a particle. (a) Retain the first
two terms of the expansion to show the kinetic energy in the form
K ! (first term) ' (second term).
The first term is the classical expression for kinetic energy. The
second term is the first-order correction to the classical expression.
Assume the particle is an electron. If its speed v is c/20, what is the
value of (b) the classical expression and (c) the first-order correc-
tion? If the electron’s speed is 0.80c, what is the value of (d) the
classical expression and (e) the first-order correction? (f) At what
speed parameter b does the first-order correction become 10% or
greater of the classical expression?
••53
In Module 28-4, we showed that a particle of charge q and
mass m will move in a circle of radius r ! mv/|q|B when its velocity
is perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field 
. We also found
that the period T of the motion is independent of speed v. These
two results are approximately correct if 
. For relativistic
speeds, we must use the correct equation for the radius:
(a) Using this equation and the definition of period (T ! 2pr/v),
find the correct expression for the period. (b) Is T independent of
v? If a 10.0 MeV electron moves in a circular path in a uniform
magnetic field of magnitude 2.20 T, what are (c) the radius accord-
ing to Chapter 28, (d) the correct radius, (e) the period according
to Chapter 28, and (f) the correct period?

What is b for a particle with (a) K ! 2.00E0 and
(b) E

mc.What are (a) b, (b) g, and (c) the ratio K/E0?
