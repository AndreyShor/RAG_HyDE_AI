70  GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
application  of  the  brake,  and  that  he  recognises  in  this  the 
non-uniformity  of  motion  (retardation)  of  the  carriage. 
But  he  is  compelled  by  nobody  to  refer  this  jerk  to  a 
"  real  "  acceleration  (retardation)  of  the  carriage.  He 
might  also  interpret  his  experience  thus  :  "  My  body  of 
reference  (the  carriage)  remains  permanently  at  rest. 
With  reference  to  it,  however,  there  exists  (during  the 
period  of  application  of  the  brakes)  a  gravitational 
field  which  is  directed  forwards  and  which  is  variable 
with  respect  to  time.  Under  the  influence  of  this  field, 
the  embankment  together  with  the  earth  moves  non- 
uniformly  in  such  a  manner  that  their  original  velocity 
in  the  backwards  direction  is  continuously  reduced."
