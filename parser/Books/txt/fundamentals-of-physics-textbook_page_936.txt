explain why the oscillations are damped.
31.14 Starting with the expressions for the field energies
and the rate of energy loss in a damped RLC circuit,
write the differential equation for the charge q on the
capacitor.
31.15 For a damped RLC circuit, apply the expression for
charge q(t).
31.16 Identify that in a damped RLC circuit, the charge
amplitude and the amplitude of the electric field energy
decrease exponentially with time.
31.17 Apply the relationship between the angular frequency
of a given damped RLC oscillator and the angular
frequency v of the circuit if R is removed.
31.18 For a damped RLC circuit, apply the expression for
the electric field energy UE as a function of time.

●Oscillations in an LC circuit are damped when a 
dissipative element R is also present in the circuit.

●The solution of this differential equation is

where
We consider only situations with small R and thus small
damping; then v* % v.

(Note that this cosine function does indeed yield maximum
q (! Q) when t ! 0.) To get the potential difference vC(t),
we divide both sides of Eq. 31-19 by C to write
and then use Eq. 25-1 to write
vC ! VC cos vt.
(31-20)
Here, VC is the amplitude of the oscillations in the potential
difference vC across the capacitor.
Next, substituting vC
vL from Eq. 31-18, we find
vL ! VC cos vt.
(31-21)
We can evaluate the right side of this equation by first not-
ing that the amplitude VC is equal to the initial (maximum)
potential difference of 57 V across the capacitor. Then we
find v with Eq. 31-4:
Thus, Eq. 31-21 becomes
vL ! (57 V) cos(7500 rad/s)t.

(b) What is the maximum rate (di/dt)max at which the current
i changes in the circuit?
KEY IDEA
With the charge on the capacitor oscillating as in Eq. 31-12,
the current is in the form of Eq. 31-13. Because f ! 0, that
equation gives us
i ! 'vQ sin vt.
Calculations: Taking the derivative, we have
We can simplify this equation by substituting CVC for Q
(because we know C and VC but not Q) and 
for v
according to Eq. 31-4.We get
This tells us that the current changes at a varying (sinu-
soidal) rate, with its maximum rate of change being
