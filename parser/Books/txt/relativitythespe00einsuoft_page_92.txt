A    FEW    INFERENCES   FROM    THE   GENERAL 
PRINCIPLE  OF  RELATIVITY 
THE  considerations  of  Section  XX  show  that  the 
general  principle  of  relativity  puts  us  in  a  position 
to  derive  properties  of  the  gravitational  field  in  a 
purely  theoretical  manner.  Let  us  suppose,  for  instance, 
that  we  know  the  space-time  "  course  "  for  any  natural 
process  whatsoever,  as  regards  the  manner  in  which  it 
takes  place  in  the  Galileian  domain  relative  to  a 
Galileian  body  of  reference  K.  By  means  of  purely 
theoretical  operations  (i.e.  simply  by  calculation)  we  are 
then  able  to  find  how  this  known  natural  process 
appears,  as  seen  from  a  reference-body  K'  which  is 
accelerated  relatively  to  K.  But  since  a  gravitational 
field  exists  with  respect  to  this  new  body  of  reference 
K',  our  consideration  also  teaches  us  how  the  gravita 
tional  field  influences  the  process  studied. 
For  example,  we  learn  that  a  body  which  is  in  a  state 
of  uniform  rectilinear  motion  with  respect  to  K  (in 
accordance  with  the  law  of  Galilei)  is  executing  an 
accelerated  and  in  general  curvilinear  motion  with 
respect  to  the  accelerated  reference-body  K'  (chest). 
This  acceleration  or  curvature  corresponds  to  the  in 
fluence  on  the  moving  body  of  the  gravitational  field 
prevailing  relatively  to  K'.  It  is  known  that  a  gravita 
tional  field  influences  the  movement  of  bodies  in  this
