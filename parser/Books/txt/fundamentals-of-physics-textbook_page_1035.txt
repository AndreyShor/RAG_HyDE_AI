Figure 33-74 shows a cylindrical
resistor of length l, radius a, and resis-
tivity r, carrying current i. (a) Show
that the Poynting vector 
at the sur-
face of the resistor is everywhere
directed normal to the surface, as
shown. (b) Show that the rate P at
which energy flows into the resistor
through its cylindrical surface, calcu-
lated by integrating the Poynting
vector over this surface, is equal to
the rate at which thermal energy is
produced:
+ 
! i2R,
where 
is an element of area on
the cylindrical surface and R is the
resistance.

A thin, totally absorbing sheet
of mass m, face area A, and specific

tromagnetic wave.The magnitude of the maximum electric field of
the wave is Em.What is the rate dT/dt at which the sheet’s tempera-
ture increases due to the absorption of the wave?

Two polarizing sheets, one directly above the other, transmit
p% of the initially unpolarized light that is perpendicularly inci-
dent on the top sheet.What is the angle between the polarizing di-
rections of the two sheets?

A laser beam of intensity I reflects from a flat, totally reflect-
ing surface of area A, with a normal at angle u with the beam.Write

A beam of intensity I reflects from a long, totally reflecting

der?

In Fig. 33-75, unpolarized light
is sent into a system of three polariz-
ing sheets, where the polarizing di-
rections of the first and second
sheets are at angles u1 ! 20" and u2 !
40". What fraction of the initial light
intensity emerges from the system?

the initial light intensity emerges
from the system?

In Fig. 33-77, an albatross
glides at a constant 15 m/s horizon-
tally above level ground, moving in
a vertical plane that contains the
Sun. It glides toward a wall of height
h ! 2.0 m, which it will just barely
clear. At that time of day, the angle
of the Sun relative to the ground is
u ! 30". At what speed does the
shadow of the albatross move (a) across the level ground and
then (b) up the wall? Suppose that later a hawk happens to glide
along the same path, also at 15 m/s. You see that when its shadow
reaches the wall, the speed of the shadow noticeably increases.
(c) Is the Sun now higher or lower in the sky than when the alba-
tross flew by earlier? (d) If the speed of the hawk’s shadow on
the wall is 45 m/s, what is the angle u of the Sun just then?

its intensity? (d) Write an expression for the electric field of the wave,
including a value for the angular wave number. (e) What is the wave-
length? (f) In which region of the electromagnetic spectrum is this elec-
tromagnetic wave?

In Fig. 33-78, where n1 ! 1.70,
n2 ! 1.50, and n3 ! 1.30, light re-
fracts from material 1 into material
2. If it is incident at point A at the
critical angle for the interface be-
tween materials 2 and 3, what are
(a) the angle of refraction at point B
and (b) the initial angle u? If, in-
stead, light is incident at B at the
critical angle for the interface between materials 2 and 3, what are
(c) the angle of refraction at point A and (d) the initial angle u? If,
instead of all that, light is incident at point A at Brewster’s angle
for the interface between materials 2 and 3, what are (e) the angle
of refraction at point B and (f) the initial angle u?

When red light in vacuum is incident at the Brewster angle

Start from Eqs. 33-11 and 33-17 and show that E(x, t) and
B(x, t), the electric and magnetic field components of a plane trav-
eling electromagnetic wave, must satisfy the “wave equations”

tions displayed in Problem 108. (b) Show that any expressions of
the form E ! Em f(kx

vt), where f(kx
vt) denotes an arbitrary function, also satisfy these wave equations.
