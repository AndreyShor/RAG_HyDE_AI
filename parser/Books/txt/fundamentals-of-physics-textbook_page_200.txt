and at cord height h ! 1.20 m, so the cart slides from x1 ! 3.00 m to
x2 ! 1.00 m. During the move, the tension in the cord is a constant
25.0 N. What is the change in the kinetic energy of the cart during
the move?

A skier is pulled by a towrope up a frictionless ski slope
that makes an angle of 12( with the horizontal. The rope moves
parallel to the slope with a constant speed of 1.0 m/s. The force
of the rope does 900 J of work on the skier as the skier moves a
distance of 8.0 m up the incline. (a) If the rope moved with a
constant speed of 2.0 m/s, how much work would the force of the
rope do on the skier as the skier moved a distance of 8.0 m up
the incline? At what rate is the force of the rope doing work on
the skier when the rope moves with a speed of (b) 1.0 m/s and
(c) 2.0 m/s?

A 0.30 kg ladle sliding on a horizontal frictionless surface is
attached to one end of a horizontal spring (k ! 500 N/m) whose
other end is fixed. The ladle has a kinetic energy of 10 J as it
passes through its equilibrium position (the point at which the
spring force is zero). (a) At what rate is the spring doing work on
the ladle as the ladle passes through its equilibrium position?

spring is compressed 0.10 m and the ladle is moving away from the
equilibrium position?

A fully loaded, slow-moving freight elevator has a cab
with a total mass of 1200 kg, which is required to travel upward
54 m in 3.0 min, starting and ending at rest.The elevator’s counter-
weight has a mass of only 950 kg, and so the elevator motor must
help.What average power is required of the force the motor exerts
on the cab via the cable?

Figure 7-42 shows a cold package of hot dogs sliding right-
ward across a frictionless floor through a distance d ! 20.0 cm
while three forces act on the package. Two of them are horizontal
and have the magnitudes F1 ! 5.00 N and F2 ! 1.00 N; the third is
angled down by u ! 60.0( and has the magnitude F3 ! 4.00 N.
(a) For the 20.0 cm displacement, what is the net work done on the
package by the three applied forces, the gravitational force on the
package, and the normal force on the package? (b) If the package
has a mass of 2.0 kg and an initial kinetic energy of 0, what is its
speed at the end of the displacement?
