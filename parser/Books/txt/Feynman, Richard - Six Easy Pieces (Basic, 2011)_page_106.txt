from the rack to the shelves, (b), and we suppose that this takes no
energy because we do not change the height. The reversible machine
then operates: it lowers the single ball to the ï¬‚oor, and it lifts the
rack a distance X, (c). Now we have ingeniously arranged the rack
so that these balls are again even with the platforms. Thus we unload
the balls onto the rack, (d); having unloaded the balls, we can restore
the machine to its original condition. Now we have three balls on
the upper three shelves and one at the bottom. But the strange thing
is that, in a certain way of speaking, we have not lifted two of them
at all because, after all, there were balls on shelves 2 and 3 before.
The resulting effect has been to lift one ball a distance 3X. Now, if
3X exceeds one foot, then we can lower the ball to return the machine
to the initial condition, (f), and we can run the apparatus again.
Therefore 3X cannot exceed one foot, for if 3X exceeds one foot we
can make perpetual motion. Likewise, we can prove that one foot
cannot exceed 3X, by making the whole machine run the opposite
