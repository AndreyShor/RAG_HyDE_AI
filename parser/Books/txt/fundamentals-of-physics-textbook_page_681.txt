The Electric Field Due to a Charged Disk

A disk of radius 2.5 cm has a surface charge density of
5.3 mC/m2 on its upper face. What is the magnitude of the electric
field produced by the disk at a point on its central axis at distance z !
12 cm from the disk?

At what distance along the central perpendicu-
lar axis of a uniformly charged plastic disk of radius 0.600 m is the
magnitude of the electric field equal to one-half the magnitude of
the field at the center of the surface of the disk?

A circular plastic disk with radius R ! 2.00 cm has a uni-
formly distributed charge Q ! #(2.00 $ 106)e on one face. A cir-
cular ring of width 30 mm is centered on that face, with the center
of that width at radius r ! 0.50 cm. In coulombs, what charge is
contained within the width of the ring?

(Fig. 22-48). The central perpendicu-
lar axis through the ring is a z axis,
with the origin at the center of the
ring. What is the magnitude of the
electric field due to the rod at (a) z !
0 and (b) z ! &? (c) In terms of R, at
what positive value of z is that mag-

Figure 22-49 shows three circu-

Figure 22-53 shows two
concentric rings, of radii R and
R, ! 3.00R, that lie on the same
plane. Point P lies on the central z
axis, at distance D ! 2.00R from the
center of the rings. The smaller ring
has uniformly distributed charge

formly distributed charge on the
larger ring if the net electric field at
P is zero?
