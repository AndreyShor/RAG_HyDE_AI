Here N0 is the number of radioactive nuclei in the sample at some arbitrary initial
time t0. Setting t0 ! 0 and rearranging Eq. 42-13 give us
(42-14)
Taking the exponential of both sides (the exponential function is the antifunction of
the natural logarithm) leads to
or
N ! N0e#lt
(radioactive decay),
(42-15)
in which N0 is the number of radioactive nuclei in the sample at t ! 0 and N is
the number remaining at any subsequent time t. Note that lightbulbs (for one
example) follow no such exponential decay law. If we life-test 1000 bulbs, we
expect that they will all “decay” (that is, burn out) at more or less the same time.
The decay of radionuclides follows quite a different law.
We are often more interested in the decay rate R (! #dN/dt) than in N itself.
Differentiating Eq. 42-15, we find
or
R ! R0e#lt
(radioactive decay),
(42-16)
an alternative form of the law of radioactive decay (Eq. 42-15). Here R0 is the
decay rate at time t ! 0 and R is the rate at any subsequent time t. We can now
rewrite Eq. 42-11 in terms of the decay rate R of the sample as
R ! lN,
(42-17)
where R and the number of radioactive nuclei N that have not yet undergone
decay must be evaluated at the same instant.
The total decay rate R of a sample of one or more radionuclides is called the
activity of that sample. The SI unit for activity is the becquerel, named for Henri
Becquerel, the discoverer of radioactivity:
1 becquerel ! 1 Bq ! 1 decay per second.
An older unit, the curie, is still in common use:
1 curie ! 1 Ci ! 3.7 " 1010 Bq.
Often a radioactive sample will be placed near a detector that does not record all
the disintegrations that occur in the sample.The reading of the detector under these
circumstances is proportional to (and smaller than) the true activity of the sample.
Such proportional activity measurements are reported not in becquerel units but
simply in counts per unit time.
Lifetimes. There are two common time measures of how long any given type
of radionuclides lasts. One measure is the half-life T1/2 of a radionuclide, which is
the time at which both N and R have been reduced to one-half their initial values.
The other measure is the mean (or average) life t, which is the time at which both
N and R have been reduced to e#1 of their initial values.
To relate T1/2 to the disintegration constant l, we put 
in Eq. 42-16
and substitute T1/2 for t.We obtain
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for T1/2, we find
Similarly, to relate t to l, we put R ! e#1R0 in Eq. 42-16, substitute t for t, and
T1/2 ! ln 2
