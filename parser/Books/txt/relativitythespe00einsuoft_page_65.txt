GENERAL  RESULTS  OF  THEORY      47 
Thus  the  body  has  the  same  energy  as  a  body  of  mass 
-fj)  moving  with  the  velocity  v.     Hence  we  can 
say  :   If  a  body  takes  up  an  amount  of  energy  ZT0,  then 
£ 
its  inertial  mass  increases    by  an  amount    ~| ;    the 
inertial  mass  of  a  body  is  not  a  constant,  but  varies 
according  to  the  change  in  the  energy  of  the  body. 
The  inertial  mass  of  a  system  of  bodies  can  even  be 
regarded  as  a  measure  of  its  energy.  The  law  of  the 
conservation  of  the  mass  of  a  system  becomes  identical 
with  the  law  of  the  conservation  of  energy,  and  is  only 
valid  provided  that  the  system  neither  takes  up  nor  sends 
out  energy.  Writing  the  expression  for  the  energy  in 
the  form 
I  —  ~Jjj 
c2 
we  see  that  the  term  we2,  which  has  hitherto  attracted 
our  attention,  is  nothing  else  than  the  energy  possessed 
by  the  body  *  before  it  absorbed  the  energy  E0. 
A  direct  comparison  of  this  relation  with  experiment 
is  not  possible  at  the  present  time,  owing  to  the  fact  that 
the  changes  in  energy  E0  to  which  we  can  subject  a 
system  are  not  large  enough  to  make  themselves 
perceptible  as  a  change  in  the  inertial  mass  of  the 
system.     -f  is  too  small  in  comparison  with  the  mass 
C 
m,  which  was  present  before  the  alteration  of  the  energy. 
It  is  owing  to  this  circumstance  that  classical  mechanics 
was  able  to  establish  successfully  the  conservation  of 
mass  as  a  law  of  independent  validity.
