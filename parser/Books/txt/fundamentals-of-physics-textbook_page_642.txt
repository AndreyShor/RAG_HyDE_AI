COULOMB’S LAW
Thus, force 
has the following magnitude and direction
(relative to the positive direction of the x axis):
1.15 ' 10$24 N
and
180-.

We can also write 
in unit-vector notation as

(b) Figure 21-7c is identical to Fig. 21-7a except that particle 3
now lies on the x axis between particles 1 and 2. Particle 3
has charge q3 # $3.20 ' 10$19 C and is at a distance

Sample Problem 21.01
Finding the net force due to two other particles
This sample problem actually contains three examples, to
build from basic stuff to harder stuff. In each we have the
same charged particle 1. First there is a single force acting
on it (easy stuff).Then there are two forces, but they are just
in opposite directions (not too bad). Then there are again
two forces but they are in very different directions (ah, now
we have to get serious about the fact that they are vectors).
The key to all three examples is to draw the forces correctly
before you reach for a calculator, otherwise you may be cal-
culating nonsense on the calculator. (Figure 21-7 is available
in WileyPLUS as an animation with voiceover.)
(a) Figure 21-7a shows two positively charged particles fixed in
place on an x axis. The charges are q1 # 1.60 ' 10$19 C and
q2 # 3.20 ' 10$19 C,and the particle separation is R # 0.0200 m.
What are the magnitude and direction of the electrostatic force
on particle 1 from particle 2?
KEY IDEAS
Because both particles are positively charged, particle 1 is re-
pelled by particle 2, with a force magnitude given by Eq. 21-4.
Thus,the direction of force 
on particle 1 is away from parti-
cle 2,in the negative direction of the x axis, as indicated in the
free-body diagram of Fig. 21-7b.
Two particles: Using Eq. 21-4 with separation R substituted
for r,we can write the magnitude F12 of this force as

particle 1.What is the net electrostatic force 
on particle 1
due to particles 2 and 3?
KEY IDEA
The presence of particle 3 does not alter the electrostatic force
on particle 1 from particle 2.Thus,force 
still acts on particle
1.Similarly,the force 
that acts on particle 1 due to particle 3
is not affected by the presence of particle 2.Because particles 1
