Angular Momentum of a Particle
The angular momentum
of a particle with linear momentum 
mass m, and linear velocity 
is
a vector quantity defined relative to a fixed point (usually an origin) as
(11-18)
The magnitude of 
is given by
(11-19)
(11-20)
(11-21)
where f is the angle between 
and 
and 
are the compo-
nents of 
and 
perpendicular to 
and 
is the perpendicular
distance between the fixed point and the extension of .The direc-
tion of 
is given by the right-hand rule for cross products.
Newton’s Second Law in Angular Form
Newton’s second
law for a particle can be written in angular form as
(11-23)
where 
is the net torque acting on the particle and 
is the angu-
lar momentum of the particle.
Angular Momentum of a System of Particles
The angu-
lar momentum 
of a system of particles is the vector sum of the
angular momenta of the individual particles:

The time rate of change of this angular momentum is equal to the
net external torque on the system (the vector sum of the torques
due to interactions with particles external to the system):

Angular Momentum of a Rigid Body
For a rigid body
rotating about a fixed axis, the component of its angular
momentum parallel to the rotation axis is
L ! Iv
(rigid body, fixed axis).
(11-31)
Conservation of Angular Momentum
The angular mo-
mentum 
of a system remains constant if the net external torque
acting on the system is zero:
(isolated system)
(11-32)
or
(isolated system).
(11-33)
This is the law of conservation of angular momentum.
Precession of a Gyroscope
A spinning gyroscope can pre-
cess about a vertical axis through its support at the rate
(11-46)
where M is the gyroscope’s mass, r is the moment arm, I is the rota-
tional inertia, and v is the spin rate.

Figure 11-23 shows three particles
of the same mass and the same constant
speed moving as indicated by the veloc-
ity vectors. Points a, b, c, and d form a
square, with point e at the center. Rank
the points according to the magnitude
of the net angular momentum of the
three-particle system when measured
about the points,greatest first.

Figure 11-24 shows two parti-
cles A and B at xyz coordinates
(1 m, 1 m, 0) and (1 m, 0, 1 m).
Acting on each particle are three
numbered forces, all of the same
magnitude and each directed paral-
lel to an axis. (a) Which of the
forces produce a torque about the
origin that is directed parallel to y?
(b) Rank the forces according to
the magnitudes of the torques they
produce on the particles about the ori-
gin, greatest first.

What happens to the initially sta-
tionary yo-yo in Fig. 11-25 if you pull it

contact on the table, as indicated),
(b) force 
(the line of action passes

(the line of action
passes to the right of the point of contact)?

The position vector 
of a particle relative to a certain point
has a magnitude of 3 m, and the force 
on the particle has a mag-
nitude of 4 N.What is the angle between the directions of 
and 
if the magnitude of the associated torque equals (a) zero and (b) 12
N"m?

In Fig. 11-26, three forces of the
same magnitude are applied to a par-
ticle at the origin (
acts directly into
the plane of the figure). Rank the
forces according to the magnitudes of
the torques they create about (a)
point P1,(b) point P2,and (c) point P3,
greatest first.

of a
particle in four situations are (1)

. In which situation
is the net torque on the particle (a) zero, (b) positive and con-
stant, (c) negative and increasing in magnitude (t , 0), and (d)
negative and decreasing in magnitude (t , 0)?

A rhinoceros beetle rides the rim of a horizontal disk rotating
counterclockwise like a merry-go-round. If the beetle then walks
along the rim in the direction of the rotation, will the magnitudes
of the following quantities (each measured about the rotation axis)
increase, decrease, or remain the same (the disk is still rotating in
the counterclockwise direction): (a) the angular momentum of the
