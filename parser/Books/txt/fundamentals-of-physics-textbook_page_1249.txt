is a position vector extending to the particle from the refer-
ence point and 
is the particle’s linear momentum (
). Although an electron
in an atom is not a classical moving particle, it too has angular momentum given
by 
, with the reference point being the nucleus. However, unlike the
classical particle, the electron’s orbital angular momentum
is quantized. For the
electron in a hydrogen atom, we can find the quantized (allowed) values by solving
Schrödinger’s equation. For that situation and any other, we can also find the quan-
tized values by using the appropriate mathematics for a cross product in a quantum
situation. (The mathematics is linear algebra, which you may have on your schedule
of classes.) Either way we find that the allowed magnitudes of

, ! is the orbital quantum number (introduced in Table 39-2, which is
reproduced in Table 40-1),and n is the electron’s principal quantum number.
The electron can have a definite value of L as given by one of the allowed
states in Eq. 40-2, but it cannot have a definite direction for the vector 
.
However, we can measure (detect) definite values of a component Lz along a
chosen measurement axis (usually taken to be a z axis) as given by
(40-3)
where 
is the orbital magnetic quantum number (Table 40-1).However,if the elec-
tron has a definite value of Lz,it does not have definite values for Lx and Ly.We can-
not get around this uncertainty by, say, first measuring Lz (getting a definite value)
and then measuring Lx (getting a definite value) because the second measurement
can change Lz and thus we no longer have a definite value for it.Also, we can never
find 
aligned with an axis because then it would have a definite direction and defi-
nite components along the other axes (namely,zero components).
A common way to depict the allowed values for Lz is shown in Fig. 40-5 for
the situation in which 
However, do not take the figure literally because it
implies (incorrectly) that 
has the definite direction of the drawn vector. Still, it
allows us to relate the five possible z components to the full vector (which has a
magnitude of 
) and to define the semi-classical angle u given by 
.

Orbital Magnetic Dipole Moment
Classically, an orbiting charged particle sets up the magnetic field of a magnetic
dipole, as we discussed in Module 32-5. From Eq. 32-28, the dipole moment is re-
lated to the angular momentum of the classical particle by
