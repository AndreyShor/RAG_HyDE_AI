(29-30)
Substituting Eqs. 29-29 and 29-30 into Eq. 29-28, we find
Note that i, R, and z have the same values for all elements ds around the loop; so
when we integrate this equation, we find that
or, because 
is simply the circumference 2pR of the loop,
This is Eq. 29-26, the relation we sought to prove.

MAGNETIC FIELDS DUE TO CURRENTS
The Biot–Savart Law
The magnetic field set up by a current-
carrying conductor can be found from the Biot–Savart law. This
law asserts that the contribution 
to the field produced by a 
current-length element 
at a point P located a distance r from
the current element is
(Biot–Savart law).
(29-3)
Here is a unit vector that points from the element toward P. The
quantity m0,called the permeability constant,has the value
4p $ 10 %7 T)m/A % 1.26 $ 10 %6 T)m/A.
Magnetic Field of a Long Straight Wire
For a long
straight wire carrying a current i, the Biot–Savart law gives, for the
magnitude of the magnetic field at a perpendicular distance R
from the wire,
(long straight wire).

Magnetic Field of a Circular Arc
The magnitude of the
magnetic field at the center of a circular arc, of radius R and central
angle f (in radians), carrying current i, is
(at center of circular arc).

Force Between Parallel Currents
Parallel wires carrying
currents in the same direction attract each other, whereas parallel
wires carrying currents in opposite directions repel each other.The
magnitude of the force on a length L of either wire is

Review & Summary
Ampere’s Law
Ampere’s law states that
(Ampere’s law).
(29-14)
The line integral in this equation is evaluated around a closed loop
called an Amperian loop. The current i on the right side is the net
current encircled by the loop. For some current distributions,
Eq. 29-14 is easier to use than Eq. 29-3 to calculate the magnetic
field due to the currents.
Fields of a Solenoid and a Toroid
Inside a long solenoid
carrying current i, at points not near its ends, the magnitude B of
the magnetic field is
B ! m0in
(ideal solenoid),
(29-23)
where n is the number of turns per unit length. Thus the internal
magnetic field is uniform. Outside the solenoid, the magnetic field
is approximately zero.
At a point inside a toroid, the magnitude B of the magnetic
field is
(toroid),
(29-24)
where r is the distance from the center of the toroid to the point.
Field of a Magnetic Dipole
The magnetic field produced by
a current-carrying coil, which is a magnetic dipole, at a point P lo-
cated a distance z along the coil’s perpendicular central axis is par-
allel to the axis and is given by
(29-27)
where 
is the dipole moment of the coil. This equation applies
only when z is much greater than the dimensions of the coil.
