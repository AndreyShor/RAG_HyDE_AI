pick a nearby point, and then draw the electric field vector
at that point, with its tail anchored on the point.
22.06 For a given point in the electric field of a charged particle,
identify the direction of the field vector 
when the particle is
positively charged and when it is negatively charged.

22.08 Identify that the equation given here for the magnitude
of an electric field applies only to a particle, not an extended
object.
22.09 If more than one electric field is set up at a point, draw
each electric field vector and then find the net electric field by
adding the individual electric fields as vectors (not as scalars).

The Electric Field Due to a Point Charge
To find the electric field due to a charged particle (often called a point charge),we place
a positive test charge at any point near the particle, at distance r. From Coulomb’s law
(Eq.21-4),the force on the test charge due to the particle with charge q is
As previously,the direction of 
is directly away from the particle if q is positive (be-
cause q0 is positive) and directly toward it if q is negative. From Eq. 22-1, we can now
write the electric field set up by the particle (at the location of the test charge) as
(charged particle).
(22-2)
Let’s think through the directions again. The direction of 
matches that of the
force on the positive test charge: directly away from the point charge if q is
positive and directly toward it if q is negative.
So, if given another charged particle, we can immediately determine the
directions of the electric field vectors near it by just looking at the sign of
the charge q. We can find the magnitude at any given distance r by converting
Eq. 22-2 to a magnitude form:
(charged particle).
(22-3)
We write 
to avoid the danger of getting a negative E when q is negative, and
then thinking the negative sign has something to do with direction. Equation 22-3
gives magnitude E only.We must think about the direction separately.
Figure 22-6 gives a number of electric field vectors at points around a
positively charged particle, but be careful. Each vector represents the vector
