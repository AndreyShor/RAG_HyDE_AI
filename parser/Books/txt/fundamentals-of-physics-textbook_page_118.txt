Figure 4-57 shows the path
taken by a drunk skunk over level
ground, from initial point i to final
point f. The angles are 
30.0°,
50.0°, and 
80.0°, and the
distances are d1
5.00 m, d2
8.00
m, and d3
12.0 m.What are the (a)
magnitude and (b) angle of the
skunk’s displacement from i to f?
114
The position vector 
of a
particle moving in the xy plane is
,
with
in meters and t in seconds. (a)
Calculate the x and y components
of the particle’s position at t
0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 s and
sketch the particle’s path in the xy plane for the interval 0 0 t 0
4.0 s. (b) Calculate the components of the particle’s velocity at
t
1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 s. Show that the velocity is tangent to the
path of the particle and in the direction the particle is moving at
each time by drawing the velocity vectors on the plot of the parti-
cle’s path in part (a). (c) Calculate the components of the parti-
cle’s acceleration at t " 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 s.

An electron having an initial horizontal velocity of magnitude
1.00 ' 109 cm/s travels into the region between two horizontal metal
plates that are electrically charged. In that region, the electron trav-
els a horizontal distance of 2.00 cm and has a constant downward ac-
celeration of magnitude 1.00 ' 1017 cm/s2 due to the charged plates.
Find (a) the time the electron takes to travel the 2.00 cm,(b) the ver-
tical distance it travels during that time, and the magnitudes of its (c)
horizontal and (d) vertical velocity components as it emerges from
the region.
116
An elevator without a ceiling is ascending with a constant
speed of 10 m/s. A boy on the elevator shoots a ball directly up-
ward, from a height of 2.0 m above the elevator floor, just as the el-
evator floor is 28 m above the ground. The initial speed of the ball
with respect to the elevator is 20 m/s. (a) What maximum height
above the ground does the ball reach? (b) How long does the ball
take to return to the elevator floor?
117
A football player punts the football so that it will have a
“hang time” (time of flight) of 4.5 s and land 46 m away. If the ball
leaves the player’s foot 150 cm above the ground, what must be the
(a) magnitude and (b) angle (relative to the horizontal) of the
ball’s initial velocity?
118
An airport terminal has a moving sidewalk to speed passen-
gers through a long corridor. Larry does not use the moving side-
walk; he takes 150 s to walk through the corridor. Curly, who sim-
ply stands on the moving sidewalk, covers the same distance in 70 s.
Moe boards the sidewalk and walks along it. How long does Moe
take to move through the corridor? Assume that Larry and Moe
walk at the same speed.
119
A wooden boxcar is moving along a straight railroad track
at speed v1. A sniper fires a bullet (initial speed v2) at it from a
high-powered rifle. The bullet passes through both lengthwise
walls of the car, its entrance and exit holes being exactly opposite
each other as viewed from within the car. From what direction, rel-
ative to the track, is the bullet fired? Assume that the bullet is not
deflected upon entering the car, but that its speed decreases by
20%.Take v1
85 km/h and v2
650 m/s. (Why don’t you need to
know the width of the boxcar?)

A sprinter running on a circular track has a velocity of con-
stant magnitude 9.20 m/s and a centripetal acceleration of magni-
tude 3.80 m/s2. What are (a) the track radius and (b) the period of
the circular motion?
121
Suppose that a space probe can withstand the stresses of a
20g acceleration. (a) What is the minimum turning radius of such a
craft moving at a speed of one-tenth the speed of light? (b) How
long would it take to complete a 90° turn at this speed?
122
You are to throw a ball with
a speed of 12.0 m/s at a target that is
height h = 5.00 m above the level at
which you release the ball (Fig. 4-58).
You want the ball’s velocity to be
horizontal at the instant it reaches
the target. (a) At what angle above
the horizontal must you throw the
ball? (b) What is the horizontal dis-
tance from the release point to the
target? (c) What is the speed of the
ball just as it reaches the target?
123
A projectile is fired with an
initial speed v0 = 30.0 m/s from level
ground at a target that is on the
ground, at distance R = 20.0 m, as
shown in Fig. 4-59. What are the (a)
least and (b) greatest launch angles
that will allow the projectile to hit the
target?
124
A graphing surprise.At time t = 0, a burrito is launched from
level ground, with an initial speed of 16.0 m/s and launch angle 
.
Imagine a position vector 
continuously directed from the
launching point to the burrito during the flight. Graph the magni-
tude r of the position vector for (a) 
= 40.0° and (b) 
= 80.0°. For
= 40.0°, (c) when does r reach its maximum value, (d) what is
that value, and how far (e) horizontally and (f) vertically is the bur-
rito from the launch point? For 
= 80.0°, (g) when does r reach its
maximum value, (h) what is that value, and how far (i) horizontally
and (j) vertically is the burrito from the launch point?
125
A cannon located at sea level fires a ball with initial speed
82 m/s and initial angle 45°.The ball lands in the water after travel-
ing a horizontal distance 686 m. How much greater would the hori-
zontal distance have been had the cannon been 30 m higher?
126
The magnitude of the velocity of a projectile when it is at its
maximum height above ground level is 10.0 m/s. (a) What is the
magnitude of the velocity of the projectile 1.00 s before it achieves
its maximum height? (b) What is the magnitude of the velocity of
the projectile 1.00 s after it achieves its maximum height? If we
take x = 0 and y = 0 to be at the point of maximum height and posi-
tive x to be in the direction of the velocity there, what are the (c) x
coordinate and (d) y coordinate of the projectile 1.00 s before it
reaches its maximum height and the (e) x coordinate and (f) y co-
ordinate 1.0 s after it reaches its maximum height?
127
A frightened rabbit moving at 6.00 m/s due east runs onto a
large area of level ice of negligible friction. As the rabbit slides
across the ice, the force of the wind causes it to have a constant ac-
celeration of 1.40 m/s2, due north. Choose a coordinate system with
the origin at the rabbit’s initial position on the ice and the positive
x axis directed toward the east. In unit-vector notation, what are
the rabbit’s (a) velocity and (b) position when it has slid for 3.00 s?
