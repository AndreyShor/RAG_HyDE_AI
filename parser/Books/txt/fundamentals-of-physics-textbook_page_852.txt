The figure shows four orientations, at angle u, of a magnetic dipole moment 
in a
magnetic field. Rank the orientations according to (a) the magnitude of the torque on
the dipole and (b) the orientation energy of the dipole, greatest first.

is again at rest?
KEY IDEA
The work Wa done by the applied torque would be equal to
the change in the coil’s orientation energy due to its change
in orientation.
Calculations: From Eq. 28-39 (Wa ! Uf % Ui), we find
Substituting for m from Eq.28-35 (m ! NiA),we find that
(Answer)
Similarly, we can show that to change the orientation by an-
other 90°, so that the dipole moment is opposite the field,
another 5.4 mJ is required.

Sample Problem 28.07
Rotating a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field
Figure 28-21 shows a circular coil with 250 turns, an area A
of 2.52 $ 10%4 m2, and a current of 100 mA.The coil is at rest
in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude B ! 0.85 T, with
its magnetic dipole moment 
initially aligned with .
(a) In Fig. 28-21, what is the direction of the current in the
coil?
Right-hand rule: Imagine cupping the coil with your right
hand so that your right thumb is outstretched in the direc-
tion of .The direction in which your fingers curl around the
coil is the direction of the current in the coil.Thus, in the wires
on the near side of the coil—those we see in Fig. 28-21—the
current is from top to bottom.
(b) How much work would the torque applied by an exter-
nal agent have to do on the coil to rotate it 90" from its ini-

So far, we have identified only a current-carrying coil and a permanent mag-
net as a magnetic dipole. However, a rotating sphere of charge is also a magnetic
dipole, as is Earth itself (approximately). Finally, most subatomic particles, in-
cluding the electron, the proton, and the neutron, have magnetic dipole mo-
ments. As you will see in Chapter 32, all these quantities can be viewed as cur-
rent loops. For comparison, some approximate magnetic dipole moments are
shown in Table 28-2.
Language. Some instructors refer to U in Eq. 28-38 as a potential energy and
relate it to work done by the magnetic field when the orientation of the dipole
changes. Here we shall avoid the debate and say that U is an energy associated
with the dipole orientation.
