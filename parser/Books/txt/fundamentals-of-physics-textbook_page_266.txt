Collisions in Two Dimensions
When two bodies collide, the impulse between them determines the directions in
which they then travel. In particular, when the collision is not head-on, the bodies
do not end up traveling along their initial axis. For such two-dimensional
collisions in a closed, isolated system, the total linear momentum must still be
conserved:
.
(9-77)
If the collision is also elastic (a special case), then the total kinetic energy is also
conserved:
K1i & K2i ! K1f & K2f.
(9-78)
Equation 9-77 is often more useful for analyzing a two-dimensional collision
if we write it in terms of components on an xy coordinate system. For example,
Fig.9-21 shows a glancing collision (it is not head-on) between a projectile body and a
target body initially at rest.The impulses between the bodies have sent the bodies off
at angles u1 and u2 to the x axis,along which the projectile initially traveled.In this situ-

Next, let’s reconsider the first collision, but we have to
be careful with the notation for block 2: its velocity v2f just
after the first collision is the same as its velocity v2i (! 5.0 m/s)
just before the second collision. Applying Eq. 9-68 to the
first collision and using the given v1i ! 10 m/s, we have

9.34 For an isolated system in which a two-dimensional colli-
sion occurs, apply the conservation of momentum along
each axis of a coordinate system to relate the momentum
components along an axis before the collision to the momen-
tum components along the same axis after the collision.
9.35 For an isolated system in which a two-dimensional elastic
collision occurs, (a) apply the conservation of momentum
along each axis of a coordinate system to relate the momen-
tum components along an axis before the collision to the 
momentum components along the same axis after the colli-
sion and (b) apply the conservation of total kinetic energy to
relate the kinetic energies before and after the collision.
●If two bodies collide and their motion is not along a single axis
(the collision is not head-on), the collision is two-dimensional.
If the two-body system is closed and isolated, the law of con-
servation of momentum applies to the collision and can be
written as
.

1i & P

2i ! P

In component form, the law gives two equations that de-
scribe the collision (one equation for each of the two dimen-
sions). If the collision is also elastic (a special case), the
conservation of kinetic energy during the collision gives a
third equation:
K1i & K2i ! K1f & K2f.
