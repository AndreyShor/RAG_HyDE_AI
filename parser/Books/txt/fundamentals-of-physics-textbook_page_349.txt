In Fig. 11-47, two skaters, each
of mass 50 kg, approach each other
along parallel paths separated by
3.0 m. They have opposite velocities
of 1.4 m/s each. One skater carries
one end of a long pole of negligible
mass, and the other skater grabs the
other end as she passes. The skaters
then rotate around the center of the pole. Assume that the friction
between skates and ice is negligible. What are (a) the radius of the
circle, (b) the angular speed of the skaters, and (c) the kinetic energy
of the two-skater system? Next, the skaters pull along the pole until
they are separated by 1.0 m. What then are (d) their angular speed
and (e) the kinetic energy of the system? (f) What provided the en-
ergy for the increased kinetic energy?

A Texas cockroach of mass 0.17 kg runs counterclockwise
around the rim of a lazy Susan (a circular disk mounted on a vertical
axle) that has radius 15 cm, rotational inertia 5.0 $ 10%3 kg"m2, and
frictionless bearings. The cockroach’s speed (relative to the ground)
is 2.0 m/s,and the lazy Susan turns clockwise with angular speed v0 !
2.8 rad/s. The cockroach finds a bread crumb on the rim and, of
course,stops.(a) What is the angular speed of the lazy Susan after the
cockroach stops? (b) Is mechanical energy conserved as it stops?

A man stands on a platform that is rotating (with-
out friction) with an angular speed of 1.2 rev/s; his arms are
outstretched and he holds a brick in each hand.The rotational iner-
tia of the system consisting of the man, bricks, and platform about
the central vertical axis of the platform is 6.0 kg"m2.If by moving the
bricks the man decreases the rotational inertia of the system to 2.0
kg"m2, what are (a) the resulting angular speed of the platform and
(b) the ratio of the new kinetic energy of the system to the original
kinetic energy? (c) What source provided the added kinetic energy?

The rotational inertia of a collapsing spinning star drops to 
its initial value. What is the ratio of the new rotational kinetic en-
ergy to the initial rotational kinetic energy?

of the angular momentum of the middle particle, and (c) the mag-
nitude of the angular momentum of the asssembly?

tional inertia of 0.140 kg

erage torque acting on the flywheel about its central axis during
this period? (b) Assuming a constant angular acceleration, through
what angle does the flywheel turn? (c) How much work is done on
the wheel? (d) What is the average power of the flywheel?

Figure 11-43 shows three rotating, uniform disks that are cou-
pled by belts.One belt runs around the rims of disks A and C.Another
belt runs around a central hub on disk A and the rim of disk B. The
belts move smoothly without slippage on the rims and hub.Disk A has
radius R; its hub has radius 0.5000R; disk B has radius 0.2500R; and
disk C has radius 2.000R. Disks B and C have the same density (mass
per unit volume) and thickness.What is the ratio of the magnitude of
the angular momentum of disk C to that of disk B?
