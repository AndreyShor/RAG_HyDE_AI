In Fig. 15-28, a spring–block
system is put into SHM in two ex-
periments. In the first, the block is
pulled from the equilibrium position
through a displacement d1 and then
released. In the second, it is pulled
from 
the 
equilibrium 
position
through a greater displacement d2 and then released. Are the
(a) amplitude, (b) period, (c) frequency, (d) maximum kinetic en-
ergy, and (e) maximum potential energy in the second experiment
greater than, less than, or the same as those in the first experiment?

Figure 15-29 gives, for three situations, the displacements x(t)
of a pair of simple harmonic oscillators (A and B) that are identical
except for phase. For each pair, what phase shift (in radians and in
degrees) is needed to shift the curve for A to coincide with the
curve for B? Of the many possible answers, choose the shift with
the smallest absolute magnitude.
QUESTIONS

The acceleration a(t) of a parti-
cle undergoing SHM is graphed in
Fig. 15-21. (a) Which of the labeled
points corresponds to the particle
at !xm? (b) At point 4, is the veloc-
ity of the particle positive, negative,
or zero? (c) At point 5, is the parti-
cle at !xm, at %xm, at 0, between
!xm and 0, or between 0 and %xm?

Which of the following relationships between the acceleration
a and the displacement x of a particle involve SHM: (a) a $ 0.5x,
(b) a $ 400x2, (c) a $ !20x, (d) a $ !3x2?

You are to complete Fig. 15-22a
so that it is a plot of velocity v versus
time t for the spring–block oscillator
that is shown in Fig. 15-22b for t $ 0.
(a) In Fig. 15-22a, at which lettered
point or in what region between the
points should the (vertical) v axis in-
tersect the t axis? (For example,
should it intersect at point A, or
maybe in the region between points
A and B?) (b) If the block’s veloc-
ity is given by v $ !vm sin(vt % f),
what is the value of f? Make it pos-
itive, and if you cannot specify the
value (such as %p/2 rad), then give
a range of values (such as between
0 and p/2 rad).

You are to complete Fig. 15-23a
so that it is a plot of acceleration a
versus time t for the spring–block
oscillator that is shown in Fig. 15-
23b for t $ 0. (a) In Fig. 15-23a, at
which lettered point or in what re-
gion between the points should the
(vertical) a axis intersect the t axis?
(For example, should it intersect at
point A, or maybe in the region be-
tween points A and B?) (b) If the
block’s acceleration is given by a $
!am cos(vt % f), what is the value
of f? Make it positive, and if you cannot specify the value (such as
%p/2 rad), then give a range of values (such as between 0 and p/2).

Figure 15-24 shows
the x(t) curves for three
experiments involving a
particular 
spring–box
system 
oscillating 
in
SHM. Rank the curves
according to (a) the sys-
tem’s angular frequency,
(b) the spring’s poten-
tial energy at time t $ 0,
(c) the box’s kinetic en-
ergy at t $ 0, (d) the
box’s speed at t $ 0, and (e) the box’s maximum kinetic energy, great-
est first.

Figure 15-25 shows plots of the kinetic energy K versus
position x for three harmonic oscillators that have the same mass.
Rank the plots according to (a) the
corresponding spring constant and
(b) the corresponding period of the
oscillator, greatest first.

Figure 15-26 shows three physical
pendulums consisting of identical uni-
form spheres of the same mass that
are rigidly connected by identical rods
of negligible mass. Each pendulum is
vertical and can pivot about suspen-
sion point O. Rank the pendulums ac-
cording to their period of oscillation,
greatest first.

You are to build the oscillation
transfer device shown in Fig. 15-27. It
consists of two spring–block systems
hanging from a flexible rod. When
the spring of system 1 is stretched
and then released, the resulting SHM
of system 1 at frequency f1 oscillates
the rod.The rod then exerts a driving force on system 2, at the same
frequency f1.You can choose from four springs with spring constants
k of 1600,1500,1400,and 1200 N/m,and four blocks with masses m of
800, 500, 400, and 200 kg. Mentally determine which spring should go
with which block in each of the two systems to maximize the ampli-
tude of oscillations in system 2.
