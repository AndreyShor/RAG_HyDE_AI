Figure 10-12 A rigid body in cross section,
with its center of mass at O.The parallel-
axis theorem (Eq. 10-36) relates the 
rotational inertia of the body about an axis
through O to that about a parallel axis
through a point such as P, a distance h
from the body’s center of mass.

We need to relate the rotational inertia 
around the axis at P to that around the 
axis at the com.
through the center of mass (remember these two axes must be parallel).Then the
rotational inertia I about the given axis is
I ! Icom & Mh2
(parallel-axis theorem).
(10-36)
Think of the distance h as being the distance we have shifted the rotation axis
from being through the com.This equation is known as the parallel-axis theorem.
We shall now prove it.
Proof of the Parallel-Axis Theorem
Let O be the center of mass of the arbitrarily shaped body shown in cross section
in Fig. 10-12. Place the origin of the coordinates at O. Consider an axis through O
perpendicular to the plane of the figure, and another axis through point P paral-
lel to the first axis. Let the x and y coordinates of P be a and b.
Let dm be a mass element with the general coordinates x and y. The rota-
tional inertia of the body about the axis through P is then, from Eq. 10-35,
which we can rearrange as
(10-37)
From the definition of the center of mass (Eq. 9-9), the middle two integrals of
Eq. 10-37 give the coordinates of the center of mass (multiplied by a constant)
I !" (x2 & y2) dm % 2a" x dm % 2b" y dm &" (a2 & b2) dm.
I !" r 2 dm !" [(x % a)2 & (y % b)2] dm,
