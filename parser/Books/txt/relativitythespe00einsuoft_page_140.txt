relativity,  the  "  time  "  x±  enters  into  natural  laws  in  the

A  four-dimensional  continuum  described  by  the 
"  co-ordinates  "  xlt  X2,  xs,  x±,  was  called  "  world  "  by 
Minkowski,  who  also  termed  a  point -event  a  "  world- 
point."  From  a  "  happening "  in  three-dimensional 
space,  physics  becomes,  as  it  were,  an  "  existence  "  in 
the  four-dimensional  "  world." 
This  four-dimensional  "  world  "  bears  a  close  similarity 
to  the  three-dimensional  "  space "  of  (Euclidean) 
analytical  geometry.  If  we  introduce  into  the  latter  a 
new  Cartesian  co-ordinate  system  (x\,  x'2,  x'3)  with 
the  same  origin,  then  x'lt  x'2>  x'3>  are  linear  homogeneous 
functions  of  xlt  x2,  xa>  which  identically  satisfy  the 
equation

The  analogy  with  (12)  is  a  complete  one.  We  can 
regard  Minkowski's  "  world  "  in  a  formal  manner  as  a 
four-dimensional  Euclidean  space  (with  imaginary 
time  co-ordinate)  ;  the  Lorentz  transformation  corre 
sponds  to  a  "  rotation  "  of  the  co-ordinate  system  in  the 
four-dimensional  "  world."
