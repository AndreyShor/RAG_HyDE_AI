43-3 A NATURAL NUCLEAR REACTOR
thoughtful design and with scrupulous attention to
detail. There seems no chance that a nuclear reactor
could go critical “naturally.”
However, things were different in the distant
past. Both 235U and 238U are radioactive, with half-
lives of 7.04 " 108 y and 44.7 " 108 y, respectively.
Thus, the half-life of the readily fissionable 235U is
about 6.4 times shorter than that of 238U. Because
235U decays faster, there was more of it, relative to
238U, in the past. Two billion years ago, in fact, this
abundance was not 0.72%, as it is now, but 3.8%.
This abundance happens to be just about the abun-
dance to which natural uranium is artificially en-
riched to serve as fuel in modern power reactors.
With this readily fissionable fuel available, the
presence of a natural reactor (provided certain other conditions are met) is
less surprising.The fuel was there.Two billion years ago, incidentally, the high-
est order of life-form to have evolved was the blue-green alga.
2. What Is the Evidence?
The mere depletion of 235U in an ore deposit does
not prove the existence of a natural fission reactor. One looks for more con-
vincing evidence.
If there was a reactor,there must now be fission products.Of the 30 or so el-
ements whose stable isotopes are produced in a reactor, some must still remain.
Study of their isotopic abundances could provide the evidence we need.
Of the several elements investigated,the case of neodymium is spectacularly
convincing. Figure 43-9a shows the isotopic abundances of the seven stable
neodymium isotopes as they are normally found in nature. Figure 43-9b shows
these abundances as they appear among the ultimate stable fission products of
the fission of 235U.The clear differences are not surprising, considering the totally
different origins of the two sets of isotopes.Note particularly that 142Nd,the dom-
inant isotope in the natural element,is absent from the fission products.
The big question is:What do the neodymium isotopes found in the uranium
ore body in West Africa look like? If a natural reactor operated there, we would
expect to find isotopes from both sources (that is, natural isotopes as well as
fission-produced isotopes). Figure 43-9c shows the abundances after dual-source
and other corrections have been made to the data. Comparison of Figs. 43-9b and
c indicates that there was indeed a natural fission reactor at work.

actor was built of lumps of uranium embed-
ded in blocks of graphite.
