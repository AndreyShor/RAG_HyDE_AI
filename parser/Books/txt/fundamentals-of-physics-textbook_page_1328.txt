At t ! 0 we begin to observe two identical radioactive nuclei that
have a half-life of 5 min.At t ! 1 min, one of the nuclei decays. Does
that event increase or decrease the chance that the second nucleus
will decay in the next 4 min, or is there no effect on the second nu-
cleus? (Are the events cause and effect,or random?)

Figure 42-17 shows the curve for the binding energy per nu-
cleon )Eben versus mass number A. Three isotopes are indicated.
Rank them according to the energy required to remove a nucleon
from the isotope, greatest first.

At t ! 0,a sample of radionuclide A has twice the decay rate as a

have (simultaneously) the same decay rate?

Discovering the Nucleus
•1
A 7Li nucleus with a kinetic energy of 3.00 MeV is sent toward
a 232Th nucleus. What is the least center-to-center separation be-
tween the two nuclei, assuming that the (more massive) 232Th nu-
cleus does not move?
•2
Calculate the distance of closest approach for a head-on colli-
sion between a 5.30 MeV alpha particle and a copper nucleus.
••3
A 10.2 MeV Li nucleus is shot directly at the center of a Ds
nucleus. At what center-to-center distance does the Li momentar-
ily stop, assuming the Ds does not move?
••4
In a Rutherford scattering experiment, assume that an
incident alpha particle (radius 1.80 fm) is headed directly toward a
target gold nucleus (radius 6.23 fm). What energy must the alpha
particle have to just barely “touch” the gold nucleus?
••5
When an alpha particle collides elastically with a nucleus,
the nucleus recoils. Suppose a 5.00 MeV alpha particle has a head-
on elastic collision with a gold nucleus that is initially at rest.What
is the kinetic energy of (a) the recoiling nucleus and (b) the re-
bounding alpha particle?

Some Nuclear Properties
•6
The strong neutron excess (defined as N # Z) of high-mass
nuclei is illustrated by noting that most high-mass nuclides could
never fission into two stable nuclei without neutrons being left
over. For example, consider the spontaneous fission of a 235U nu-
cleus into two stable daughter nuclei with atomic numbers 39 and
53. From Appendix F, determine the name of the (a) first and (b)
second daughter nucleus. From Fig. 42-5, approximately how many
