A parallel-plate capacitor is connected to a battery of elec-
tric potential difference V. If the plate separation is decreased,
do the following quantities increase, decrease, or remain the
same: (a) the capacitor’s capacitance, (b) the potential difference
across the capacitor, (c) the charge on the capacitor, (d) the en-
ergy stored by the capacitor, (e) the magnitude of the electric
field between the plates, and (f) the energy density of that elec-
tric field?

You are to connect capacitances C1 and C2, with C1 ( C2, to
a battery, first individually, then in series, and then in parallel.

stored, greatest first.

Initially, a single capacitance C1 is wired to a battery. Then ca-
pacitance C2 is added in parallel. Are (a) the potential difference
across C1 and (b) the charge q1 on C1 now more than, less than, or
the same as previously? (c) Is the equivalent capacitance C12 of C1

on C1 and C2 together more than, less than, or equal to the charge
stored previously on C1?
