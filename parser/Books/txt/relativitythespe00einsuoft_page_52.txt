34     SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
i.e.  with  the  velocity  c.  According  to  the  equations  of 
the  Lorentz  transformation,  this  simple  relation  between 
x  and  t  involves  a  relation  between  x'  and  t'.  In  point 
of  fact,  if  we  substitute  for  x  the  value  ct  in  the  first 
and  fourth  equations  of  the  Lorentz  transformation, 
we  obtain  :

from  which,  by  division,  the  expression 
x'=ct' 
immediately  follows.  If  referred  to  the  system  K' ',  the 
propagation  of  light  takes  place  according  to  this 
equation.  We  thus  see  that  the  velocity  of  transmission 
relative  to  the  reference-body  K'  is  also  equal  to  c.  The 
same  result  is  obtained  for  rays  of  light  advancing  in 
any  other  direction  whatsoever.  Of  course  this  is  not 
surprising,  since  the  equations  of  the  Lorentz  trans 
formation  were  derived  conformably  to  this  point  of 
view.
