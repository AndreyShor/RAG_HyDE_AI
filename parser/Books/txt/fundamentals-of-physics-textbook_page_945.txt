where VL is the amplitude of vL. From Eq. 30-35 (#L ! 'L di/dt), we can write
the potential difference across an inductance L in which the current is changing
at the rate diL/dt as
(31-46)
If we combine Eqs. 31-45 and 31-46, we have
(31-47)
Our concern, however, is with the current, so we integrate:
(31-48)
We now modify this equation in two ways. First, for reasons of symmetry of
notation, we introduce the quantity XL, called the inductive reactance of an
inductor, which is defined as
XL ! vdL
(inductive reactance).
(31-49)
The value of XL depends on the driving angular frequency vd. The unit of the
inductive time constant tL indicates that the SI unit of XL is the ohm, just as it is
for XC and for R.
Second, we replace 'cos vdt in Eq. 31-48 with a phase-shifted sine:
'cos vdt ! sin(vdt ' 90°).
You can verify this identity by shifting a sine curve 90° in the positive direction.
With these two changes, Eq. 31-48 becomes
(31-50)
From Eq. 31-29, we can also write this current in the inductance as
iL ! IL sin(vdt ' f),
(31-51)
where IL is the amplitude of the current iL. Comparing Eqs. 31-50 and 31-51, we
see that for a purely inductive load the phase constant f for the current is $90°.
We also see that the voltage amplitude and current amplitude are related by
VL ! ILXL
(inductor).
(31-52)
Although we found this relation for the circuit of Fig. 31-12, it applies to any
inductance in any ac circuit.
Comparison of Eqs. 31-45 and 31-50, or inspection of Fig. 31-13a, shows
that the quantities iL and vL are 90° out of phase. In this case, however, iL lags
vL; that is, monitoring the current iL and the potential difference vL in the cir-
cuit of Fig. 31-12 shows that iL reaches its maximum value after vL does, by
one-quarter cycle. The phasor diagram of Fig. 31-13b also contains this informa-
tion. As the phasors rotate counterclockwise in the figure, the phasor labeled IL
does indeed lag that labeled VL, and by an angle of 90°. Be sure to convince your-
self that Fig. 31-13b represents Eqs. 31-45 and 31-50.

Checkpoint 5
If we increase the driving frequency in a circuit with a purely capacitive load, do
(a) amplitude VC and (b) amplitude IC increase, decrease, or remain the same? If,
instead, the circuit has a purely inductive load, do (c) amplitude VL and (d) amplitude
IL increase, decrease, or remain the same?
