In Fig. 21-26, particle 1 of charge %80.0 mC and particle 2 of
charge #40.0 mC are held at separation L ! 20.0 cm on an x axis.

cle 3, of charge q3 ! 20.0 mC, if particle 3 is placed at (a) x ! 40.0
cm and (b) x ! 80.0 cm? What should be the (c) x and (d) y coordi-
nates of particle 3 if the net electrostatic force on it due to particles

The initial charges on the three identical metal spheres in
Fig. 21-24 are the following: sphere A, Q; sphere B, %Q/4; and
sphere C, Q/2, where Q ! 2.00 $ 10 %14 C. Spheres A and B are
fixed in place, with a center-to-center separation of d ! 1.20 m,
which is much larger than the spheres. Sphere C is touched first to
sphere A and then to sphere B and is then removed. What then is
the magnitude of the electrostatic force between spheres A and B?

Three charged particles form a triangle: particle 1 with charge

charge Q2 is at (0, %3.00 mm), and particle 3 with charge q ! 18.0
nC is at (4.00 mm, 0). In unit-vector notation, what is the electro-
static force on particle 3 due to the other two particles if Q2 is

Two point charges of 30 nC and %40 nC are held fixed on an x
axis, at the origin and at x ! 72 cm, respectively. A particle with a
charge of 42 mC is released from rest at x ! 28 cm. If the initial ac-
celeration of the particle has a magnitude of 100 km/s2, what is the
particle’s mass?

Two small, positively charged spheres have a combined
charge of 5.0 $ 10 %5 C. If each sphere is repelled from the other by
an electrostatic force of 1.0 N when the spheres are 2.0 m apart,
what is the charge on the sphere with the smaller charge?

unknown charge q3 is to be located such that the net electrostatic
force on it from particles 1 and 2 is zero, what must be the (a) x and
(b) y coordinates of particle 3?

Two engineering students, John with a mass of 90 kg and Mary
with a mass of 45 kg, are 30 m apart. Suppose each has a 0.01% im-
balance in the amount of positive and negative charge, one student
being positive and the other negative.Find the order of magnitude of
the electrostatic force of attraction between them by replacing each
student with a sphere of water having the same mass as the student.

In the radioactive decay of Eq. 21-13, a 238U nucleus transforms
to 234Th and an ejected 4He. (These are nuclei, not atoms, and thus
electrons are not involved.) When the separation between 234Th and
4He is 9.0 $ 10%15 m, what are the magnitudes of (a) the electrostatic
force between them and (b) the acceleration of the 4He particle?

In a spherical metal shell of radius R, an electron is shot from
the center directly toward a tiny hole in the shell, through which it
escapes. The shell is negatively charged with a surface charge den-
sity (charge per unit area) of 6.90 $ 10%13 C/m2.What is the magni-
tude of the electron’s acceleration when it reaches radial dis-
tances (a) r ! 0.500R and (b) 2.00R?

An electron is projected with an initial speed vi ! 3.2 $ 105 m/s
directly toward a very distant proton that is at rest. Because the
proton mass is large relative to the electron mass, assume that the
proton remains at rest. By calculating the work done on the elec-
tron by the electrostatic force, determine the distance between the
two particles when the electron instantaneously has speed 2vi.

In an early model of the hydrogen atom (the Bohr model), the
electron orbits the proton in uniformly circular motion. The radius

(a) the smallest allowed orbit and (b) the second smallest orbit? (c)

crease, or stay the same?
