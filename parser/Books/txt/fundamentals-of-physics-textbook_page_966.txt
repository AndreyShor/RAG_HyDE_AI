What capacitance would you connect across a 1.30 mH
inductor to make the resulting oscillator resonate at 3.50 kHz?

A series circuit with resistor–inductor–capacitor combina-
tion R1, L1, C1 has the same resonant frequency as a second circuit
with a different combination R2, L2, C2. You now connect the two
combinations in series. Show that this new circuit has the same res-
onant frequency as the separate circuits.

closed and the other two switches
open, the circuit has a time con-
stant tC. With switch S2 closed
and the other two switches open,
the circuit has a time constant tL.

other two switches open, the cir-
cuit oscillates with a period T.Show that

In Fig. 31-38, a three-phase generator G produces electri-
cal power that is transmitted by means of three wires. The electric
potentials (each relative to a common reference level) are V1 !
A sin vdt for wire 1, V2 ! A sin(vdt ' 120°) for wire 2, and V3 !
A sin(vdt ' 240°) for wire 3. Some types of industrial equipment
(for example, motors) have three terminals and are designed to be
connected directly to these three wires.To use a more conventional
two-terminal device (for example, a
lightbulb), one connects it to any two
of the three wires. Show that the po-
tential difference between any two of
the wires (a) oscillates sinusoidally

motor draws an rms current of 0.650 A, what is its effective resis-
tance, relative to power transfer? (b) Is this the same as the resis-
tance of the motor’s coils, as measured with an ohmmeter with the
motor disconnected from the outlet?

capacitor is fully charged for this condition to occur?

does the current lag the generator emf? (b) If the maximum gener-
ator emf is 30.0 V, what should be the resistance of the circuit to
