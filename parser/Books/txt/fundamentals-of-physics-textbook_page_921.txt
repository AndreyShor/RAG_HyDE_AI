In Fig. 30-36, a wire forms a closed circular loop, of radius 
R ! 2.0 m and resistance 4.0 1. The circle is centered on a long
straight wire; at time t ! 0, the current in the long straight wire
is 5.0 A rightward. Thereafter, the current changes according to 
i ! 5.0 A % (2.0 A/s2)t2. (The straight wire is insulated; so there
is no electrical contact between it and the wire of the loop.)
What is the magnitude of the current induced in the loop at
times t , 0?

In Fig. 30-33, a circular loop of wire 10 cm
in diameter (seen edge-on) is placed with its
normal 
at an angle u ! 30° with the direction
of a uniform magnetic field 
of magnitude
0.50 T. The loop is then rotated such that 
ro-
tates in a cone about the field direction at the
rate 100 rev/min; angle u remains unchanged
during the process. What is the emf induced in
the loop?

A certain elastic conducting material is stretched into a cir-
cular loop of 12.0 cm radius. It is placed with its plane perpendi-
cular to a uniform 0.800 T magnetic field. When released, the ra-
dius of the loop starts to shrink at an instantaneous rate of
75.0 cm/s.What emf is induced in the loop at that instant?

In Fig. 30-34, a 120-
turn coil of radius 1.8 cm and resist-
ance 5.3 1 is coaxial with a solenoid
of 220 turns/cm and diameter 3.2 cm.
The solenoid current drops from
1.5 A to zero in time interval 't !
25 ms.What current is induced in the
coil during 't?

A wire loop of radius 12 cm and re-
sistance 8.5 1 is located in a uniform
magnetic field 
that changes in magni-
tude as given in Fig. 30-35. The vertical
axis scale is set by Bs ! 0.50 T, and the
horizontal axis scale is set by ts ! 6.00 s.
The loop’s plane is perpendicular to

either L or 2L, as drawn. Rank the situations according to (a) the
magnitude of the force required of us and (b) the rate at which
energy is transferred from us to thermal energy of the loop,
greatest first.

Figure 30-31 shows three situations in which a wire loop lies
partially in a magnetic field.The magnitude of the field is either in-
creasing or decreasing, as indicated. In each situation, a battery is
part of the loop. In which situations are the induced emf and the
battery emf in the same direction along the loop?

Figure 30-37a shows a circuit consisting of an ideal battery
with emf # ! 6.00 mV, a resistance R, and a small wire loop of area
5.0 cm2. For the time interval t ! 10 s to t ! 20 s, an external mag-
netic field is set up throughout the loop. The field is uniform, its
direction is into the page in Fig. 30-37a, and the field magnitude is
given by B ! at, where B is in teslas, a is a constant, and t is in
seconds. Figure 30-37b gives the current i in the circuit before, dur-
ing, and after the external field is set up. The vertical axis scale is
set by is ! 2.0 mA. Find the constant a in the equation for the field
magnitude.
