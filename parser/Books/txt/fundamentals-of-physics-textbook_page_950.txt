Figure 31-15 Phasor diagrams and
graphs of the alternating emf # and
current i for the driven RLC circuit
of Fig. 31-7. In the phasor diagram of
(a) and the graph of (b), the current i
lags the driving emf # and the cur-
rent’s phase constant f is positive. In
(c) and (d), the current i leads the
driving emf # and its phase constant
f is negative. In (e) and (f ), the cur-
rent i is in phase with the driving emf
# and its phase constant f is zero.
ferent results for the phase constant, depending on the relative values of the
reactances XL and XC:
XL - XC: The circuit is said to be more inductive than capacitive. Equation 31-65
tells us that f is positive for such a circuit, which means that phasor I rotates
behind phasor #m (Fig. 31-15a). A plot of # and i versus time is like that in 
Fig. 31-15b. (Figures 31-14c and d were drawn assuming XL - XC.)
XC - XL: The circuit is said to be more capacitive than inductive. Equation 31-65
tells us that f is negative for such a circuit, which means that phasor I rotates
ahead of phasor #m (Fig. 31-15c). A plot of # and i versus time is like that in
Fig. 31-15d.
XC ! XL: The circuit is said to be in resonance, a state that is discussed next.
Equation 31-65 tells us that f ! 0+ for such a circuit, which means that phasors
#m and I rotate together (Fig. 31-15e).A plot of # and i versus time is like that
in Fig. 31-15f.
As illustration, let us reconsider two extreme circuits: In the purely inductive
circuit of Fig. 31-12, where XL is nonzero and XC ! R ! 0, Eq. 31-65 tells us that 
the circuit’s phase constant is f ! $90+ (the greatest value of f), consistent with
Fig. 31-13b. In the purely capacitive circuit of Fig. 31-10, where XC is nonzero and
XL ! R ! 0, Eq. 31-65 tells us that the circuit’s phase constant is f ! '90+ (the
least value of f), consistent with Fig. 31-11b.
Resonance
Equation 31-63 gives the current amplitude I in an RLC circuit as a function of
the driving angular frequency vd of the external alternating emf. For a given
resistance R, that amplitude is a maximum when the quantity vdL ' 1/vdC in the
