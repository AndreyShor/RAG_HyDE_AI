I1, I2, and I12 can be expressed in the following way: The instanta-
neous height of the water wave at the detector for the wave from
hole 1 can be written as (the real part of)
, where the “ampli-
tude” 
is, in general, a complex number. The intensity is propor-
tional to the mean squared height or, when we use the complex
numbers, to 
. Similarly, for hole 2 the height is 
and the
intensity is proportional to 
. When both holes are open, the
wave heights add to give the height 
and the intensity
. Omitting the constant of proportionality for our present
purposes, the proper relations for interfering waves are
(6.2)
You will notice that the result is quite different from that ob-
tained with bullets (6.1). If we expand 
we see that 
(6.3)
where d is the phase difference between 
and 
. In terms of the
intensities, we could write
(6.4)
The last term in (6.4) is the “interference term.” So much for water
waves. The intensity can have any value, and it shows interference.
An experiment with electrons
Now we imagine a similar experiment with electrons. It is shown
diagrammatically in Fig. 6-3. We make an electron gun which con-
sists of a tungsten wire heated by an electric current and surrounded
by a metal box with a hole in it. If the wire is at a negative voltage
with respect to the box, electrons emitted by the wire will be accel-
erated toward the walls and some will pass through the hole. All
the electrons which come out of the gun will have (nearly) the same
