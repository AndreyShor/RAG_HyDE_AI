Figure 29-34 shows three arrangements of three long straight
wires carrying equal currents directly into or out of the page.
(a) Rank the arrangements according to the magnitude of the net
force on wire A due to the currents in the other wires, greatest first.
(b) In arrangement 3, is the angle between the net force on wire A
and the dashed line equal to, less than, or more than 45°?

A straight conductor carrying cur-
rent i ! 5.0 A splits into identical semi-
circular arcs as shown in Fig. 29-36.
What is the magnetic field at the center
C of the resulting circular loop?

In Fig. 29-37, a current i ! 10 A
is set up in a long hairpin conductor
formed by bending a wire into a
semicircle of radius R ! 5.0 mm.Point
b is midway between the straight sec-
tions and so distant from the semicir-
cle that each straight section can be
approximated as being an infinite
wire. What are the (a) magnitude and
(b) direction (into or out of the page)
of 
at a and the (c) magnitude and
(d) direction of 
at b?

In Fig. 29-38, point P is at perpendicular distance R ! 2.00 cm
from a very long straight wire carrying a current.The magnetic field
set up at point P is due to contributions from all the identical cur-
rent-length elements i
along the wire.What is the distance s to the

Magnetic Field Due to a Current
•1
A surveyor is using a magnetic
compass 6.1 m below a power line
in which there is a steady current of
100 A. (a) What is the magnetic
field at the site of the compass due
to the power line? (b) Will this field
interfere seriously with the com-
pass reading? The horizontal com-
ponent of Earth’s magnetic field at
the site is 20 mT.
•2
Figure 29-35a shows an ele-
ment of length ds ! 1.00 mm in a
very long straight wire carrying
current. The current in that ele-
ment sets up a differential mag-
netic field 
at points in the
surrounding space. Figure 29-35b
gives the magnitude dB of the field
for points 2.5 cm from the element,
as a function of angle u between the wire and a straight line to the
point. The vertical scale is set by dBs ! 60.0 pT. What is the magni-
tude of the magnetic field set up by the entire wire at perpendicular
distance 2.5 cm from the wire?
•3
At a certain location in the Philippines, Earth’s magnetic
field of 39 mT is horizontal and directed due north. Suppose the
net field is zero exactly 8.0 cm above a long, straight, horizontal
wire that carries a constant current. What are the (a) magnitude
and (b) direction of the current?
