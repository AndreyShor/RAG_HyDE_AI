Figure 21-11 shows
four situations in which
five charged particles are
evenly spaced along an
axis. The charge values
are indicated except for
the central particle,which
has the same charge in all
four situations. Rank the
situations according to
the magnitude of the net
electrostatic force on the central particle,greatest first.

Figure 21-12 shows three pairs of identical spheres that are to
be touched together and then separated.The initial charges on them
are indicated. Rank the pairs according to (a) the magnitude of the
charge transferred during touching and (b) the charge left on the
positively charged sphere,greatest first.

Figure 21-14 shows two charged
particles on an axis. The charges are
free to move. However, a third
charged particle can be placed at a
certain point such that all three particles are then in equilibrium.(a) Is
that point to the left of the first two
particles, to their right, or between
them? (b) Should the third particle be
positively or negatively charged? (c)
Is the equilibrium stable or unstable?

In Fig. 21-15, a central particle of
charge $q is surrounded by two cir-
cular rings of charged particles.What
are the magnitude and direction of
the net electrostatic force on the cen-
tral particle due to the other parti-
cles? (Hint: Consider symmetry.)

A positively charged ball is
brought close to an electrically neu-
tral isolated conductor. The conductor is then grounded while the
ball is kept close. Is the conductor charged positively, charged neg-
atively, or neutral if (a) the ball is first taken away and then the

Figure 21-16 shows three situations involving a charged parti-
cle and a uniformly charged spherical shell. The charges are given,
and the radii of the shells are indicated. Rank the situations ac-
cording to the magnitude of the force on the particle due to the
presence of the shell, greatest first.
