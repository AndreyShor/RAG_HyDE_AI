focus) F of the convex mirror, and its distance from the mirror surface is the focal
length f of the mirror. If we placed a card at this focal point, an image of object O
would not appear on the card; so this focal point is not like that of a concave
mirror.
Two Types. To distinguish the actual focal point of a concave mirror from
the perceived focal point of a convex mirror, the former is said to be a real focal
point and the latter is said to be a virtual focal point. Moreover, the focal length f
of a concave mirror is taken to be a positive quantity, and that of a convex mirror
a negative quantity. For mirrors of both types, the focal length f is related to the
radius of curvature r of the mirror by
(spherical mirror),
(34-3)
where r is positive for a concave mirror and negative for a convex mirror.
Images from Spherical Mirrors
Inside. With the focal point of a spherical mirror defined, we can find the rela-
tion between image distance i and object distance p for concave and convex
spherical mirrors. We begin by placing the object O inside the focal point of the
concave mirror—that is, between the mirror and its focal point F (Fig. 34-10a).

IMAGES
Figure 34-9 (a) In a concave mirror, incident parallel light rays are brought to a real
focus at F, on the same side of the mirror as the incident light rays. (b) In a convex mir-
ror, incident parallel light rays seem to diverge from a virtual focus at F, on the side of
the mirror opposite the light rays.

If you intercept the
