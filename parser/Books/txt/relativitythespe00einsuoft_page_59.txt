THE  EXPERIMENT  OF  FIZEAU        41 
recent  and  most  excellent  measurements  by  Zeeman,  the 
influence  of  the  velocity  of  flow  v  on  the  propagation  of 
light  is  represented  by  formula  (B)  to  within  one  per 
cent. 
Nevertheless  we  must  now  draw  attention  to  the  fact 
that  a  theory  of  this  phenomenon  was  given  by  H.  A. 
Lorentz  long  before  the  statement  of  the  theory  of 
relativity.  This  theory  was  of  a  purely  electrody- 
namical  nature,  and  was  obtained  by  the  use  of  particular 
hypotheses  as  to  the  electromagnetic  structure  of  matter. 
This  circumstance,  however,  does  not  in  the  least 
diminish  the  conclusiveness  of  the  experiment  as  a 
crucial  test  in  favour  of  the  theory  of  relativity,  for  the 
electrodynamics  of  Maxwell-Lorentz,  on  which  the 
original  theory  was  based,  in  no  way  opposes  the  theory 
of  relativity.  Rather  has  the  latter  been  developed 
from  electrodynamics  as  an  astoundingly  simple  com 
bination  and  generalisation  of  the  hypotheses,  formerly 
independent  of  each  other,  on  which  electrodynamics 
was  built.
