angular momentum (or spin) , with which an intrinsic spin
magnetic dipole moment
is associated:

have only the values given by

only their components on an axis of measurement (usually
called the z axis) can be observed.
32.22 Identify that the observed components Sz and ms,z are
quantized and explain what that means.
32.23 Apply the relationship between the component Sz and
the spin magnetic quantum number ms, specifying the
allowed values of ms.

tation of an electron.
32.25 Determine the z components ms,z of the spin magnetic
