37-6 MOMENTUM AND ENERGY
a tiny fraction of the total mass involved that there is no hope of measuring the
mass change with even the best laboratory balances. Mass and energy truly seem to
be separately conserved. However, in a nuclear reaction (in which nuclei or funda-
mental particles interact),the energy released is often about a million times greater
than in a chemical reaction,and the change in mass can easily be measured.
An object’s mass m and the equivalent energy E0 are related by
E0 ! mc2,
(37-43)
which, without the subscript 0, is the best-known science equation of all time.This
energy that is associated with the mass of an object is called mass energy or rest
energy. The second name suggests that E0 is an energy that the object has even
when it is at rest, simply because it has mass. (If you continue your study of
physics beyond this book, you will see more refined discussions of the relation
between mass and energy. You might even encounter disagreements about just
what that relation is and means.)
Table 37-3 shows the (approximate) mass energy, or rest energy, of a few
objects.The mass energy of, say, a U.S. penny is enormous; the equivalent amount
of electrical energy would cost well over a million dollars. On the other hand,
the entire annual U.S. electrical energy production corresponds to a mass of only
a few hundred kilograms of matter (stones, burritos, or anything else).
In practice, SI units are rarely used with Eq. 37-43 because they are too large
to be convenient. Masses are usually measured in atomic mass units, where
1 u ! 1.660 538 86 ( 10&27 kg,
(37-44)
and energies are usually measured in electron-volts or multiples of it, where
1 eV ! 1.602 176 462 ( 10&19 J.

In the units of Eqs. 37-44 and 37-45, the multiplying constant c2 has the values

Total Energy
Equation 37-43 gives, for any object, the mass energy E0 that is associated with
the object’s mass m, regardless of whether the object is at rest or moving. If the
object is moving, it has additional energy in the form of kinetic energy K. If we
assume that the object’s potential energy is zero, then its total energy E is the sum
of its mass energy and its kinetic energy:
E ! E0 ' K ! mc 2 ' K.
(37-47)
Although we shall not prove it, the total energy E can also be written as
E ! gmc2,
(37-48)
where g is the Lorentz factor for the object’s motion.
