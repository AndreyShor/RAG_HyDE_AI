What Is Physics?
In this chapter we focus on the physics of three common types of force: frictional
force, drag force, and centripetal force. An engineer preparing a car for the
Indianapolis 500 must consider all three types. Frictional forces acting on the tires
are crucial to the car’s acceleration out of the pit and out of a curve (if the car hits
an oil slick, the friction is lost and so is the car). Drag forces acting on the car
from the passing air must be minimized or else the car will consume too much
fuel and have to pit too early (even one 14 s pit stop can cost a driver the race).
Centripetal forces are crucial in the turns (if there is insufficient centripetal force,
the car slides into the wall).We start our discussion with frictional forces.
Friction
Frictional forces are unavoidable in our daily lives. If we were not able to coun-
teract them, they would stop every moving object and bring to a halt every
rotating shaft. About 20% of the gasoline used in an automobile is needed to
counteract friction in the engine and in the drive train. On the other hand, if fric-
tion were totally absent, we could not get an automobile to go anywhere, and we
could not walk or ride a bicycle. We could not hold a pencil, and, if we could, it
would not write. Nails and screws would be useless, woven cloth would fall apart,
and knots would untie.

6-1 FRICTION
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
6.01 Distinguish between friction in a static situation and a 
kinetic situation.
6.02 Determine direction and magnitude of a frictional force.
6.03 For objects on horizontal, vertical, or inclined planes in
situations involving friction, draw free-body diagrams and
apply Newton’s second law.
●When a force 
tends to slide a body along a surface, a fric-
tional force from the surface acts on the body. The frictional
force is parallel to the surface and directed so as to oppose the
sliding. It is due to bonding between the body and the surface.
If the body does not slide, the frictional force is a static
frictional force . If there is sliding, the frictional force is a 
kinetic frictional force 
.
●If a body does not move, the static frictional force 
and
the component of 
parallel to the surface are equal in magni-
tude, and 
is directed opposite that component. If the com-
ponent increases, fs also increases.

●The magnitude of 
has a maximum value 
s,max given by
fs,max" msFN,
where ms is the coefficient of static friction and FN is the mag-
nitude of the normal force. If the component of 
parallel to
the surface exceeds fs,max, the body slides on the surface.
●If the body begins to slide on the surface, the magnitude of the
frictional force rapidly decreases to a constant value 
given by
fk " mkFN,
where mk is the coefficient of kinetic friction.
