ated by 90Sr and if the efficiency of the thermal–electric conver-
sion process is 5.0%, how much 90Sr is needed?

(a) A neutron of mass mn and kinetic energy K makes a
head-on elastic collision with a stationary atom of mass m. Show
that the fractional kinetic energy loss of the neutron is given by
Find )K/K for each of the following acting as the stationary atom:
(b) hydrogen, (c) deuterium, (d) carbon, and (e) lead. (f) If 
K ! 1.00 MeV initially, how many such head-on collisions would it
take to reduce the neutron’s kinetic energy to a thermal value
(0.025 eV) if the stationary atoms it collides with are deuterium, a
commonly used moderator? (In actual moderators, most collisions
are not head-on.)

A Natural Nuclear Reactor
•26
How long ago was the ratio 235U/238U in natural uranium de-
posits equal to 0.15?
•27
The natural fission reactor discussed in Module 43-3 is esti-
mated to have generated 15 gigawatt-years of energy during its
lifetime. (a) If the reactor lasted for 200 000 y, at what average
power level did it operate? (b) How many kilograms of 235U did it
consume during its lifetime?
••28
Some uranium samples from the natural reactor site de-
scribed in Module 43-3 were found to be slightly enriched in 235U,
rather than depleted. Account for this in terms of neutron absorp-
tion by the abundant isotope 238U and the subsequent beta and
alpha decay of its products.
••29
The uranium ore mined today contains only 0.72% of
fissionable 235U, too little to make reactor fuel for thermal-neutron
fission. For this reason, the mined ore must be enriched with 235U.
Both 235U (T1/2 ! 7.0 " 108 y) and 238U (T1/2 ! 4.5 " 109 y) are ra-
dioactive. How far back in time would natural uranium ore have
been a practical reactor fuel, with a 235U/238U ratio of 3.0%?

Thermonuclear Fusion: The Basic Process
•30
Verify that the fusion of 1.0 kg of deuterium by the reaction
(Q ! '3.27 MeV)
could keep a 100 W lamp burning for 2.5 " 104 y.
•31
Calculate the height of the Coulomb barrier for the
head-on collision of two deuterons, with effective radius 2.1 fm.
••32
For overcoming the Coulomb barrier for fusion, methods
other than heating the fusible material have been suggested. For
example, if you were to use two particle accelerators to accelerate
two beams of deuterons directly toward each other so as to collide
head-on, (a) what voltage would each accelerator require in order
for the colliding deuterons to overcome the Coulomb barrier? (b)
Why do you suppose this method is not presently used?
••33
Calculate the Coulomb barrier height for two 7Li nuclei that
are fired at each other with the same initial kinetic energy K. (Hint:
Use Eq. 42-3 to calculate the radii of the nuclei.)

Thermonuclear Fusion in the Sun 
and Other Stars
•35
Assume that the protons in a hot ball of protons each have a
kinetic energy equal to kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and
T is the absolute temperature. If T ! 1 " 107 K, what (approxi-
mately) is the least separation any two protons can have?

•37
The Sun has mass 2.0 " 1030 kg and radiates energy at the
rate 3.9 " 1026 W. (a) At what rate is its mass changing? (b) What
fraction of its original mass has it lost in this way since it began to
burn hydrogen, about 4.5 " 109 y ago?
•38
We have seen that Q for the overall proton–proton fusion
cycle is 26.7 MeV. How can you relate this number to the Q values
for the reactions that make up this cycle, as displayed in Fig. 43-11?
•39
Show that the energy released when three alpha particles
fuse to form 12C is 7.27 MeV. The atomic mass of 4He is 4.0026 u,
and that of 12C is 12.0000 u.
••40
Calculate and compare the energy released by (a) the fusion
of 1.0 kg of hydrogen deep within the Sun and (b) the fission of 1.0
kg of 235U in a fission reactor.
••41
A star converts all its hydrogen to helium, achieving a
100% helium composition. Next it converts the helium to carbon
via the triple-alpha process,
The mass of the star is 4.6 " 1032 kg, and it generates energy at the
rate of 5.3 " 1030 W. How long will it take to convert all the helium
to carbon at this rate?
