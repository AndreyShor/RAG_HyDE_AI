ON  THE  IDEA  OF  TIME  IN  PHYSICS 
LIGHTNING  has  struck  the  rails  on  our  railway 
embankment  at  two  places  A  and  B  far  distant 
from  each  other.  I  make  the  additional  assertion 
that  these  two  lightning  flashes  occurred  simultaneously. 
If  I  ask  you  whether  there  is  sense  in  this  statement, 
you  will  answer  my  question  with  a  decided 
"  Yes."  But  if  I  now  approach  you  with  the  request 
to  explain  to  me  the  sense  of  the  statement  more 
precisely,  you  find  after  some  consideration  that  the 
answer  to  this  question  is  not  so  easy  as  it  appears  at 
first  sight. 
After  some  time  perhaps  the  following  answer  would 
occur  to  you  :  "  The  significance  of  the  statement  is 
clear  in  itself  and  needs  no  further  explanation  ;  of 
course  it  would  require  some  consideration  if  I  were  to 
be  commissioned  to  determine  by  observations  whether 
in  the  actual  case  the  two  events  took  place  simul 
taneously  or  not."  I  cannot  be  satisfied  with  this  answer 
for  the  following  reason.  Supposing  that  as  a  result 
of  ingenious  considerations  an  able  meteorologist  were 
to  discover  that  the  lightning  must  always  strike  the 
places  A  and  B  simultaneously,  then  we  should  be  faced 
with  the  task  of  testing  whether  or  not  this  theoretical 
result  is  in  accordance  with  the  reality.  We  encounter
