30-9 MUTUAL INDUCTION
which has the same form as Eq. 30-28,
L ! N0/i,
(30-58)
the definition of inductance.We can recast Eq. 30-57 as
M21i1 ! N2021.
(30-59)
If we cause i1 to vary with time by varying R, we have
(30-60)
The right side of this equation is, according to Faraday’s law, just the magnitude
of the emf #2 appearing in coil 2 due to the changing current in coil 1.Thus, with a
minus sign to indicate direction,
(30-61)
which you should compare with Eq. 30-35 for self-induction (# ! %L di/dt).
Interchange. Let us now interchange the roles of coils 1 and 2, as in Fig. 30-19b;
that is, we set up a current i2 in coil 2 by means of a battery, and this produces a
magnetic flux 012 that links coil 1. If we change i2 with time by varying R, we then
have, by the argument given above,
(30-62)
Thus, we see that the emf induced in either coil is proportional to the rate of
change of current in the other coil. The proportionality constants M21 and M12
seem to be different. However, they turn out to be the same, although we cannot
prove that fact here. Thus, we have
M21 ! M12 ! M,
(30-63)
and we can rewrite Eqs. 30-61 and 30-62 as
(30-64)
and

Figure 30-19 Mutual induction. (a) The mag-
netic field 
produced by current i1 in coil
1 extends through coil 2. If i1 is varied (by
varying resistance R), an emf is induced in
coil 2 and current registers on the meter
connected to coil 2. (b) The roles of the
coils interchanged.
