5-1 NEWTON’S FIRST AND SECOND LAWS
x components: Along the x axis we have
F3,x " max $ F1,x $ F2,x
" m(a cos 503) $ F1 cos($1503) $ F2 cos 903.
Then, substituting known data, we find
F3,x " (2.0 kg)(3.0 m/s2) cos 503 $ (10 N) cos($1503)
$ (20 N) cos 903
" 12.5 N.
y components: Similarly, along the y axis we find
F3,y " may $ F1,y $ F2,y
" m(a sin 503) $ F1 sin($1503) $ F2 sin 903
" (2.0 kg)(3.0 m/s2) sin 503 $ (10 N) sin($1503)
$ (20 N) sin 903
" $10.4 N.
Vector: In unit-vector notation, we can write
" F3,x # F3,y " (12.5 N) $ (10.4 N)
% (13 N) $ (10 N) .

Sample Problem 5.02
Two-dimensional forces, cookie tin
Here we find a missing force by using the acceleration. In
the overhead view of Fig. 5-4a, a 2.0 kg cookie tin is acceler-
ated at 3.0 m/s2 in the direction shown by , over a friction-
less horizontal surface. The acceleration is caused by three
horizontal forces, only two of which are shown:
of magni-
tude 10 N and 
of magnitude 20 N.What is the third force
in unit-vector notation and in magnitude-angle notation?
KEY IDEA
The net force 
on the tin is the sum of the three forces
and is related to the acceleration 
via Newton’s second law
.Thus,
,
(5-6)
which gives us
(5-7)
Calculations: Because this is a two-dimensional problem,
we cannot find 
merely by substituting the magnitudes for
the vector quantities on the right side of Eq. 5-7. Instead, we
must vectorially add 
,
(the reverse of 
), and 
(the reverse of 
), as shown in Fig. 5-4b. This addition can
be done directly on a vector-capable calculator because we
know both magnitude and angle for all three vectors.
However, here we shall evaluate the right side of Eq. 5-7 in
terms of components, first along the x axis and then along
the y axis. Caution: Use only one axis at a time.

These are two
of the three
horizontal force
vectors.
This is the resulting
horizontal acceleration
vector.
We draw the product
of mass and acceleration
as a vector.
Then we can add the three
vectors to find the missing
third force vector.
