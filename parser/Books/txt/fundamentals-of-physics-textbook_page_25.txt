Whitenton of Southern Polytechnic State University, and Jerry Shi, of Pasadena City College, performed the Herculean task
of working out solutions for every one of the homework problems in the book.At John Wiley publishers, the book received
support from Stuart Johnson, Geraldine Osnato and Aly Rentrop, the editors who oversaw the entire project from start to
finish. We thank Elizabeth Swain, the production editor, for pulling all the pieces together during the complex production
process. We also thank Maddy Lesure for her design of the text and the cover; Lee Goldstein for her page make-up; Helen
Walden for her copyediting; and Lilian Brady for her proofreading. Jennifer Atkins was inspired in the search for unusual
