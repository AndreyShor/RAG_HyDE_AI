32     SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
to  the  impenetrability  of  solid  bodies.  In  every  such 
framework  we  imagine  three  surfaces  perpendicular  to 
each  other  marked  out,  and  designated  as  "  co-ordinate 
planes "  ("  co-ordinate  system ").  A  co-ordinate 
system  K  then  corresponds  to  the  embankment,  and  a 
co-ordinate  system  K'  to  the  train.  An  event,  wherever 
it  may  have  taken  place,  would  be  fixed  in  space  with 
respect  to  K  by  the  three  perpendiculars  x,  y,  z  on  the 
co-ordinate  planes,  and  with  regard  to  time  by  a  time- 
x.  value  t.  Relative  to  K',  the 
same  event  would  be  fixed 
in  respect  of  space  and  time 
by  corresponding  values  x't 
y',  z',  t',  which  of  course  are 
not  identical  with  x,  y,  z, 
t.  It  has  already  been  set 
forth  in  detail  how  these 
magnitudes  are  to  be  re 
garded  as  results  of  physical  measurements. 
Obviously  our  problem  can  be  exactly  formulated  in 
the  following  manner.  What  are  the  values  x,'  y',  z',  t', 
of  an  event  with  respect  to  K',  when  the  magnitudes 
x,  y,  z,  t,  of  the  same  event  with  respect  to  K  are  given  ? 
The  relations  must  be  so  chosen  that  the  law  of  the 
transmission  of  light  in  vacua  is  satisfied  for  one  and  the 
same  ray  of  light  (and  of  course  for  every  ray)  with 
respect  to  K  arid  K'.  For  the  relative  orientation  in 
space  of  the  co-ordinate  systems  indicated  in  the  dia 
gram  (Fig.  2),  this  problem  is  solved  by  means  of  the 
equations  :
