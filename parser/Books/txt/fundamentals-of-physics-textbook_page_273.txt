In Fig. 9-37, three uniform thin rods,
each of length L ! 22 cm, form an in-
verted U. The vertical rods each have a
mass of 14 g; the horizontal rod has a
mass of 42 g. What are (a) the x coordi-
nate and (b) the y coordinate of the sys-
tem’s center of mass?

What are (a) the x coordinate and
(b) the y coordinate of the center of mass
for the uniform plate shown in Fig. 9-38 if

A stone is dropped at t ! 0.A second stone, with twice the
mass of the first,
is dropped from the same point at
t ! 100 ms. (a) How far below the release point is the center of
mass of the two stones at t ! 300 ms? (Neither stone has yet
reached the ground.) (b) How fast is the center of mass of the two-
stone system moving at that time?

A 1000 kg automobile is at rest at a traffic signal. At the in-
stant the light turns green, the automobile starts to move with a
constant acceleration of 4.0 m/s2. At the same instant a 2000 kg
truck, traveling at a constant speed of 8.0 m/s, overtakes and passes
the automobile. (a) How far is the com of the automobile–truck
system from the traffic light at t ! 3.0 s? (b) What is the speed of
the com then?

A big olive (m ! 0.50 kg) lies at the origin of an xy
coordinate system, and a big Brazil nut (M ! 1.5 kg) lies at the
point (1.0, 2.0) m. At t ! 0, a force 
begins to
act on the olive, and a force 
begins to act on
the nut. In unit-vector notation, what is the displacement of the
center of mass of the olive–nut system at t ! 4.0 s, with respect to
its position at t ! 0?

Two skaters, one with mass 65 kg and the other with mass
40 kg, stand on an ice rink holding a pole of length 10 m and neg-
ligible mass. Starting from the ends of the pole, the skaters pull
themselves along the pole until they meet. How far does the 40
kg skater move?

A shell is shot with an initial velocity 
of 20 m/s, at
an angle of 
with the horizontal. At the top of the trajec-
tory, the shell explodes into two fragments of equal mass (Fig.
9-42). One fragment, whose speed immediately after the explo-
sion is zero, falls vertically. How far from the gun does the other
fragment land, assuming that the terrain is level and that air drag
is negligible?

Figure 9-39 shows a cubical box that
has been constructed from uniform metal
plate of negligible thickness. The box is
open at the top and has edge length L !
40 cm. Find (a) the x coordinate, (b) the y
coordinate, and (c) the z coordinate of
the center of mass of the box.

In the ammonia (NH3) mole-
cule of Fig. 9-40, three hydrogen (H)
atoms form an equilateral triangle, with
the center of the triangle at distance d !
9.40 $ 10%11 m from each hydrogen
atom. The nitrogen (N) atom is at the
apex of a pyramid, with the three hydro-
gen atoms forming the base. The nitro-
gen-to-hydrogen atomic mass ratio is
13.9, and the nitrogen-to-hydrogen dis-
tance is L ! 10.14 $ 10%11 m. What are
the (a) x and (b) y coordinates of the
molecule’s center of mass?

A uniform soda can of mass
0.140 kg is 12.0 cm tall and filled with
0.354 kg of soda (Fig. 9-41). Then small
holes are drilled in the top and bottom
(with negligible loss of metal) to drain
the soda. What is the height h of the
com of the can and contents (a) initially
and (b) after the can loses all the soda?
(c) What happens to h as the soda
drains out? (d) If x is the height of the
remaining soda at any given instant,
find x when the com reaches its lowest
point.

In Figure 9-43, two particles are launched from the origin of
the coordinate system at time t ! 0. Particle 1 of mass m1 ! 5.00 g is
shot directly along the x axis on a frictionless floor, with constant
speed 10.0 m/s. Particle 2 of mass m2 ! 3.00 g is shot with a velocity
of magnitude 20.0 m/s, at an upward angle such that it always stays
directly above particle 1. (a) What is the maximum height Hmax
reached by the com of the two-particle system? In unit-vector no-
tation, what are the (b) velocity and (c) acceleration of the com
when the com reaches Hmax?
