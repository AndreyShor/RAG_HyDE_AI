THE  LORENTZ  TRANSFORMATION      31 
Section  VI  we  have  to  do  with  places  and  times  relative 
both  to  the  train  and  to  the  embankment.  How  are 
we  to  find  the  place  and  time  of  an  event  in  relation  to 
the  train,  when  we  know  the  place  and  time  of  the 
event  with  respect  to  the  railway  embankment  ?  Is 
there  a  thinkable  answer  to  this  question  of  such  a 
nature  that  the  law  of  transmission  of  light  in  vacua 
does  not  contradict  the  principle  of  relativity  ?  In 
other  words  :  Can  we  conceive  of  a  relation  between 
place  and  time  of  the  individual  events  relative  to  both 
reference-bodies,  such  that  every  ray  of  light  possesses 
the  velocity  of  transmission  c  relative  to  the  embank 
ment  and  relative  to  the  train  ?  This  question  leads  to 
a  quite  definite  positive  answer,  and  to  a  perfectly  definite 
transformation  law  for  the  space-time  magnitudes  of 
an  event  when  changing  over  from  one  body  of  reference 
to  another. 
Before  we  deal  with  this,  we  shall  introduce  the 
following  incidental  consideration.  Up  to  the  present 
we  have  only  considered  events  taking  place  along  the 
embankment,  which  had  mathematically  to  assume  the 
function  of  a  straight  line.  In  the  manner  indicated 
in  Section  II  we  can  imagine  this  reference-body  supple 
mented  laterally  and  in  a  vertical  direction  by  means  of 
a  framework  of  rods,  so  that  an  event  which  takes  place 
anywhere  can  be  localised  with  reference  to  this  frame 
work.  Similarly,  we  can  imagine  the  train  travelling 
with  the  velocity  v  to  be  continued  across  the  whole  of 
space,  so  that  every  event,  no  matter  how  far  off  it 
may  be,  could  also  be  localised  with  respect  to  the  second 
framework.  Without  committing  any  fundamental  error, 
we  can  disregard  the  fact  that  in  reality  these  frame 
works  would  continually  interfere  with  each  other,  owing
