Figure 22-14 (a) Point P is on an extension of the line of charge.
(b) P is on a line of symmetry of the line of charge, at perpendicu-
lar distance y from that line. (c) Same as (b) except that P is not on
a line of symmetry.
Checkpoint 2
The figure here shows three nonconducting rods,one circular and
two straight.Each has a uniform charge of magnitude Q along its top
half and another along its bottom half.For each rod,what is the
direction of the net electric field at point P?

Straight line, with point P at perpendicular dis-
tance y from the line of charge, as in Fig. 22-14b. In the
expression for dE, replace r with an expression involving x
and y. If P is on the perpendicular bisector of the line of
charge,find an expression for the adding component of 
That will introduce either sin u or cos u.Reduce the result-
ing two variables x and u to one, x, by replacing the
trigonometric function with an expression (its definition)
involving x and y. Integrate over x from end to end of the
line of charge. If P is not on a line of symmetry, as in
Fig. 22-14c, set up an integral to sum the components dEx,
and integrate over x to find Ex. Also set up an integral
to sum the components dEy, and integrate over x again to
find Ey.Use the components Ex and Ey in the usual way to
find the magnitude E and the orientation of .

in terms of the total charge Q of the distribution,replace l
with Q/L,in which L is the length of the distribution.

22.19 Sketch a disk with uniform charge and indicate the di-
rection of the electric field at a point on the central axis if
the charge is positive and if it is negative.
22.20 Explain how the equation for the electric field on the
central axis of a uniformly charged ring can be used to find
the equation for the electric field on the central axis of a
uniformly charged disk.
22.21 For a point on the central axis of a uniformly charged
disk, apply the relationship between the surface charge den-
sity s, the disk radius R, and the distance z to that point.

The Electric Field Due to a Charged Disk
Now we switch from a line of charge to a surface of charge by examining the elec-
tric field of a circular plastic disk, with a radius R and a uniform surface charge
density s (charge per unit area, Table 22-1) on its top surface. The disk sets up a
