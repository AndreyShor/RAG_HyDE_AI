Sample Problem 40.02
Energy levels of multiple electrons in a 2D infinite potential well
Seven electrons are confined to a square corral (two-
dimensional infinite potential well) with widths Lx ! Ly ! L
(Fig. 39-13). Assume that the electrons do not electrically
interact with one another.
(a) What is the electron configuration for the ground state
of the system of seven electrons?
One-electron diagram: We can determine the electron con-
figuration of the system by placing the seven electrons in the
corral one by one, to build up the system. Because we assume
the electrons do not electrically interact with one another, we
can use the energy-level diagram for a single trapped electron

These are the 
four lowest
energy levels 
of the corral.
The first
electron is in
the lowest 
level.
A second electron
can be there only if 
it has the opposite 
spin. The level is 
then full.
Two quantum
states have that 
energy. Two 
electrons (with 
opposite spins)
can be in each 
state. Then that
level is also full.
The lowest 
energy for
a third
electron is on
the next level up.

for one electron in a square corral.
(Energy E is in multiples of h2/8mL2.)
A spin-down electron occupies the
lowest level. (b) Two electrons (one
spin down, the other spin up) occupy
the lowest level of the one-electron
energy-level diagram. (c) A third
electron occupies the next energy
level. (d) Four electrons can be put

the corral. That one-electron energy-level diagram is given in
Fig. 39-15 and partially reproduced here as Fig. 40-12a. Recall
that the levels are labeled as Enx,ny for their associated energy.
For example, the lowest level is for energy E1,1, where quan-
tum number nx is 1 and quantum number ny is 1.
Pauli principle: The trapped electrons must obey the Pauli
exclusion principle; that is, no two electrons can have the
same set of values for their quantum numbers nx, ny, and
ms. The first electron goes into energy level E1,1 and can
have

Electrons can jump
up only to levels
that are not full.
Here are three
allowed jumps.
Which uses the
least energy?
If that jump is
made, the system
is then in its first
excited state.
The lowest 
energy for
the seventh
electron is
on the next
level up. The 
system of 7
electrons is in
its lowest 
energy (system
ground state).
