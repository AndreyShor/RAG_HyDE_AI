THE  APPARENT  INCOMPATIBILITY  OF  THE 
LAW  OF  PROPAGATION  OF  LIGHT  WITH 
THE  PRINCIPLE  OF  RELATIVITY 
THERE  is  hardly  a  simpler  law  in  physics  than 
that  according  to  which  light  is  propagated  in 
empty  space.  Every  child  at  school  knows,  or 
believes  he  knows,  that  this  propagation  takes  place 
in  straight  lines  with  a  velocity  0  =  300,000  km. /sec. 
At  all  events  we  know  with  great  exactness  that  this 
velocity  is  the  same  for  all  colours,  because  if  this  were 
not  the  case,  the  minimum  of  emission  would  not  be 
observed  simultaneously  for  different  colours  during 
the  eclipse  of  a  fixed  star  by  its  dark  neighbour.  By 
means  of  similar  considerations  based  on  observa 
tions  of  double  stars,  the  Dutch  astronomer  De  Sitter 
was  also  able  to  show  that  the  velocity  of  propaga 
tion  of  light  cannot  depend  on  the  velocity  of  motion 
of  the  body  emitting  the  light.  The  assumption  that 
this  velocity  of  propagation  is  dependent  on  the  direc 
tion  "  in  space  "  is  in  itself  improbable. 
In  short,  let  us  assume  that  the  simple  law  of  the 
constancy  of  the  velocity  of  light  c  (in  vacuum)  is 
justifiably  believed  by  the  child  at  school.  Who  would 
imagine  that  this  simple  law  has  plunged  the  con 
scientiously  thoughtful  physicist  into  the  greatest
