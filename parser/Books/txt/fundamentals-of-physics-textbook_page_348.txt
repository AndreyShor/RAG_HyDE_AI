The Yo-Yo
•17
A yo-yo has a rotational inertia of 950 g"cm2 and
a mass of 120 g. Its axle radius is 3.2 mm, and its string is 120 cm
long. The yo-yo rolls from rest down to the end of the string.
(a) What is the magnitude of its linear acceleration? (b) How long
does it take to reach the end of the string? As it reaches the end of
the string, what are its (c) linear speed, (d) translational kinetic en-
ergy, (e) rotational kinetic energy, and (f) angular speed?
•18
In 1980, over San Francisco Bay, a large yo-yo was
released from a crane. The 116 kg yo-yo consisted of two uniform
disks of radius 32 cm connected by an axle of radius 3.2 cm. What
was the magnitude of the acceleration of the yo-yo during (a) its
fall and (b) its rise? (c) What was the tension in the cord on which
it rolled? (d) Was that tension near the cord’s limit of 52 kN?
Suppose you build a scaled-up version of the yo-yo (same shape
and materials but larger). (e) Will the magnitude of your yo-yo’s
acceleration as it falls be greater than, less than, or the same as that
of the San Francisco yo-yo? (f) How about the tension in the cord?
