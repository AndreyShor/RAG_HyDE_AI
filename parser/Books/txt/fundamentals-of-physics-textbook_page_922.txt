INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE
••15
A square wire loop with
2.00 m sides is perpendicular to a
uniform magnetic field, with half the
area of the loop in the field as
shown in Fig. 30-43. The loop con-
tains an ideal battery with emf # !
20.0 V. If the magnitude of the field
varies with time according to B !
0.0420 % 0.870t, with B in teslas and
t in seconds, what are (a) the net emf
in the circuit and (b) the direction of
the (net) current around the loop?

One hundred turns of (insulated) copper wire are
wrapped around a wooden cylindrical core of cross-sectional area
1.20 $ 10%3 m2. The two ends of the wire are connected to a resis-
tor. The total resistance in the circuit is 13.0 1. If an externally ap-
plied uniform longitudinal magnetic field in the core changes from
1.60 T in one direction to 1.60 T in the opposite direction, how
much charge flows through a point in the circuit during the change?
••14
In Fig. 30-42a, a uniform magnetic field 
increases in
magnitude with time t as given by Fig. 30-42b, where the vertical
axis scale is set by Bs ! 9.0 mT and the horizontal scale is set by
ts ! 3.0 s. A circular conducting loop of area 8.0 $ 10%4 m2 lies in
the field, in the plane of the page. The amount of charge q passing
point A on the loop is given in Fig. 30-42c as a function of t, with
the vertical axis scale set by qs ! 6.0 mC and the horizontal axis
scale again set by ts ! 3.0 s.What is the loop’s resistance?

In Fig.
30-38,
the magnetic flux
through the loop increases according to
the relation 0B ! 6.0t2 & 7.0t, where 0B is
in milliwebers and t is in seconds. (a) What
is the magnitude of the emf induced in the
loop when t
2.0 s? (b) Is the direction of
the current through R to the right or left?

A uniform magnetic field 
is per-
pendicular to the plane of a circular loop
of diameter 10 cm formed from wire of
diameter 2.5 mm and resistivity 1.69 $
10 %8 1)m. At what rate must the magni-
tude of 
change to induce a 10 A current in the loop?
•9
A small loop of area 6.8 mm2 is placed inside a long solenoid
that has 854 turns/cm and carries a sinusoidally varying current i of
amplitude 1.28 A and angular frequency 212 rad/s.The central axes
of the loop and solenoid coincide.What is the amplitude of the emf
induced in the loop?
••10
Figure 30-39 shows a closed
loop of wire that consists of a pair of
equal semicircles, of radius 3.7 cm,
lying in mutually perpendicular
planes.The loop was formed by fold-
ing a flat circular loop along a diam-
eter until the two halves became
perpendicular to each other. A uni-
form magnetic field 
of magnitude
76 mT is directed perpendicular to
the fold diameter and makes equal
angles (of 45°) with the planes of the
semicircles.The magnetic field is reduced to zero at a uniform rate
during a time interval of 4.5 ms. During this interval, what are
the (a) magnitude and (b) direction (clockwise or counterclock-
wise when viewed along the direction of 
) of the emf induced in
the loop?

A rectangular coil of N turns and of length a and width b is
rotated at frequency f in a uniform magnetic field , as indicated in
Fig. 30-40. The coil is connected to co-rotating cylinders, against
which metal brushes slide to make contact. (a) Show that the emf
induced in the coil is given (as a function of time t) by
# ! 2pfNabB sin(2pft) ! #0 sin(2pft).
This is the principle of the commercial alternating-current gen-
erator. (b) What value of Nab gives an emf with #0 ! 150 V
when the loop is rotated at 60.0 rev/s in a uniform magnetic field
of 0.500 T?
