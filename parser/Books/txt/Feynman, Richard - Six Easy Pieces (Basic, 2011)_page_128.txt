Any great discovery of a new law is useful only if we can take
more out than we put in. Now, Newton used the second and third
of Kepler’s laws to deduce his law of gravitation. What did he pre-
dict? First, his analysis of the moon’s motion was a prediction be-
cause it connected the falling of objects on the earth’s surface with
that of the moon. Second, the question is, is the orbit an ellipse? We
shall see in a later chapter how it is possible to calculate the motion
exactly, and indeed one can prove that it should be an ellipse,* so
no extra fact is needed to explain Kepler’s ﬁrst law. Thus Newton
made his ﬁrst powerful prediction.
The law of gravitation explains many phenomena not previously
understood. For example, the pull of the moon on the earth causes
the tides, hitherto mysterious. The moon pulls the water up under
it and makes the tides—people had thought of that before, but they
were not as clever as Newton, and so they thought there ought to
be only one tide during the day. The reasoning was that the moon
pulls the water up under it, making a high tide and a low tide, and

Acceleration toward the center of a circular path. From
plane geometry, x/S = (2R – S)/x ≈ 2R/x, where R is the
radius of the earth, 4000 miles; x is the distance “travelled
horizontally” in one second; and S is the distance “fallen” in
one second (16 feet).
