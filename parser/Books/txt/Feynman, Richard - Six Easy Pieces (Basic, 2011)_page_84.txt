and the reaction would go easily. Now there actually are, in the
cells, very large molecules, much larger than the ones whose changes
we have been describing, which in some complicated way hold the
smaller molecules just right, so that the reaction can occur easily.
These very large and complicated things are called enzymes. (They
were ﬁrst called ferments, because they were originally discovered
in the fermentation of sugar. In fact, some of the ﬁrst reactions in
the cycle were discovered there.) In the presence of an enzyme the
reaction will go.
An enzyme is made of another substance called protein. Enzymes
are very big and complicated, and each one is different, each being
built to control a certain special reaction. The names of the enzymes
are written in Fig. 3-1 at each reaction. (Sometimes the same en-
zyme may control two reactions.) We emphasize that the enzymes
themselves are not involved in the reaction directly. They do not
