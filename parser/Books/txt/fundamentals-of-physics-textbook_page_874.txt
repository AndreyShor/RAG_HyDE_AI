replaced it with its equivalent, the product of the ring’s cir-
cumference 2pr and its thickness dr.
For the Amperian loop, the direction of integration indi-
cated in Fig. 29-16b is (arbitrarily) clockwise. Applying the
right-hand rule for Ampere’s law to that loop, we find that we
should take ienc as negative because the current is directed out
of the page but our thumb is directed into the page.
We next evaluate the left side of Ampere’s law 
as we did in Fig. 29-15, and we again obtain Eq. 29-18. Then

●Inside a long solenoid carrying current i, at points not near
its ends, the magnitude B of the magnetic field is

where n is the number of turns per unit length.

Magnetic Field of a Solenoid
We now turn our attention to another situation in which Ampere’s law proves
useful. It concerns the magnetic field produced by the current in a long, tightly
wound helical coil of wire. Such a coil is called a solenoid (Fig. 29-17).We assume
that the length of the solenoid is much greater than the diameter.
Figure 29-18 shows a section through a portion of a “stretched-out” sole-
noid. The solenoid’s magnetic field is the vector sum of the fields produced by
the individual turns (windings) that make up the solenoid. For points very
