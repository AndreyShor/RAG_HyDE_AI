8-1 POTENTIAL ENERGY
Checkpoint 2
A particle is to move along an x axis from x ! 0 to x1 while a conser-
vative force, directed along the x axis, acts on the particle.The figure
shows three situations in which the x component of that force varies
with x.The force has the same maximum magnitude F1 in all three sit-
uations. Rank the situations according to the change in the associated
potential energy during the particle’s motion, most positive first.

the ground, (3) at the limb, and (4) 1.0 m above the limb?
Take the gravitational potential energy to be zero at y ! 0.
KEY IDEA
Once we have chosen the reference point for y ! 0, we can
calculate the gravitational potential energy U of the system
relative to that reference point with Eq. 8-9.
Calculations: For choice (1) the sloth is at y ! 5.0 m, and
U ! mgy ! (2.0 kg)(9.8 m/s2)(5.0 m)
! 98 J.
(Answer)
For the other choices, the values of U are
(2)
U ! mgy ! mg(2.0 m) ! 39 J,
(3)
U ! mgy ! mg(0) ! 0 J,
(4)
U ! mgy ! mg($1.0 m)
! $19.6 J % $20 J.
(Answer)
(b) The sloth drops to the ground. For each choice of refer-
ence point, what is the change %U in the potential energy of
the sloth–Earth system due to the fall?
KEY IDEA
The change in potential energy does not depend on the
choice of the reference point for y ! 0; instead, it depends
on the change in height %y.
Calculation: For all four situations, we have the same %y !
$5.0 m.Thus, for (1) to (4), Eq. 8-7 tells us that
%U ! mg %y ! (2.0 kg)(9.8 m/s2)($5.0 m)
! $98 J.

Sample Problem 8.02
Choosing reference level for gravitational potential energy, sloth
Here is an example with this lesson plan: Generally you can
choose any level to be the reference level, but once chosen,
be consistent. A 2.0 kg sloth hangs 5.0 m above the ground
(Fig. 8-6).
(a) What is the gravitational potential energy U of the
sloth–Earth system if we take the reference point y ! 0 to be
(1) at the ground, (2) at a balcony floor that is 3.0 m above

in units of meters.The choice affects the value of the potential energy
U of the sloth–Earth system. However, it does not affect the change
%U in potential energy of the system if the sloth moves by, say, falling.
