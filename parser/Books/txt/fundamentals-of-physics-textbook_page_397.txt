(Answer)
Table 13-3 shows that this is a little less than the semimajor
axis of the orbit of Pluto. Thus, the comet does not get far-
ther from the Sun than Pluto.
(b) What is the eccentricity e of the orbit of comet Halley?
KEY IDEA
We can relate e, a, and Rp via Fig. 13-12, in which we see that
ea ! a % Rp.
Calculation: We have

(Answer)
This tells us that, with an eccentricity approaching unity, this
orbit must be a long thin ellipse.

Sample Problem 13.04
Kepler’s law of periods, Comet Halley
Comet Halley orbits the Sun with a period of 76 years and, in
1986, had a distance of closest approach to the Sun, its peri-
helion distance Rp, of 8.9 $ 1010 m.Table 13-3 shows that this
is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus.
(a) What is the comet’s farthest distance from the Sun,
which is called its aphelion distance Ra?
KEY IDEAS
From Fig.13-12,we see that Ra # Rp ! 2a,where a is the semi-
major axis of the orbit. Thus, we can find Ra if we first find a.
We can relate a to the given period via the law of periods 
(Eq. 13-34) if we simply substitute the semimajor axis a for r.
Calculations: Making that substitution and then solving for
a, we have
.

If we substitute the mass M of the Sun, 1.99 $ 1030 kg, and
the period T of the comet, 76 years or 2.4 $ 109 s, into 
Eq. 13-35, we find that a ! 2.7 $ 1012 m. Now we have

13-7 SATELLITES: ORBITS AND ENERGY
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
13.22 For a satellite in a circular orbit around an astronomical
body, calculate the gravitational potential energy, the kinetic
energy, and the total energy.
13.23 For a satellite in an elliptical orbit, calculate the total
energy.

Satellites: Orbits and Energy
As a satellite orbits Earth in an elliptical path, both its speed, which fixes its kinetic
energy K, and its distance from the center of Earth, which fixes its gravitational po-
tential energy U, fluctuate with fixed periods. However, the mechanical energy E of
the satellite remains constant. (Since the satellite’s mass is so much smaller than
Earth’s mass,we assign U and E for the Earth–satellite system to the satellite alone.)
