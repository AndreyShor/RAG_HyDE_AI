CHAPTER 30
INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE
Calculations: We now have a circuit with three identical 
resistors in parallel; from Eq. 27-23, their equivalent resist-
ance is Req ! R/3 ! (9.0 1)/3 ! 3.0 1. The equivalent
circuit shown in Fig. 30-18d then yields the loop equation

Figure 30-18a shows a circuit that contains three identical
resistors with resistance R ! 9.0 1, two identical inductors
with inductance L ! 2.0 mH, and an ideal battery with emf
# ! 18 V.
(a) What is the current i through the battery just after the
switch is closed?
KEY IDEA
Just after the switch is closed, the inductor acts to oppose a
change in the current through it.
Calculations: Because the current through each inductor
is zero before the switch is closed, it will also be zero just
afterward. Thus, immediately after the switch is closed, the
inductors act as broken wires, as indicated in Fig. 30-18b.
We then have a single-loop circuit for which the loop rule
gives us
# % iR ! 0.
Substituting given data, we find that
(Answer)
(b) What is the current i through the battery long after the
switch has been closed?
KEY IDEA
Long after the switch has been closed, the currents in the
circuit have reached their equilibrium values, and the
inductors act as simple connecting wires, as indicated in
Fig. 30-18c.

Initially, an inductor
acts like broken wire.
Long later, it acts
like ordinary wire.

Calculations: According to that solution, current i in-
creases exponentially from zero to its final equilibrium
value of #/R. Let t0 be the time that current i takes to reach
half its equilibrium value.Then Eq. 30-41 gives us
We solve for t0 by canceling #/R, isolating the exponential,
and taking the natural logarithm of each side.We find

A solenoid has an inductance of 53 mH and a resistance of
0.37 1. If the solenoid is connected to a battery, how long
will the current take to reach half its final equilibrium
value? (This is a real solenoid because we are considering its
small, but nonzero, internal resistance.)
KEY IDEA
We can mentally separate the solenoid into a resistance and
an inductance that are wired in series with a battery, as in 
Fig. 30-16. Then application of the loop rule leads to 
Eq. 30-39, which has the solution of Eq. 30-41 for the current
i in the circuit.
