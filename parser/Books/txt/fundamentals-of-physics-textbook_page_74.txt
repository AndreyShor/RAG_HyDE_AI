Calculations: To evaluate Eqs. 3-16 and 3-17, we find the x and
y components of each displacement. As an example, the com-
ponents for the first displacement are shown in Fig. 3-16c. We
draw similar diagrams for the other two displacements and
then we apply the x part of Eq. 3-5 to each displacement, using
angles relative to the positive direction of the x axis:
dlx " (6.00 m) cos 40° " 4.60 m 
d2x " (8.00 m) cos ($60°) " 4.00 m 
d3x " (5.00 m) cos 0° " 5.00 m.
Equation 3-16 then gives us
dnet,x " #4.60 m # 4.00 m # 5.00 m
" 13.60 m.
Similarly, to evaluate Eq. 3-17, we apply the y part of Eq. 3-5
to each displacement:
dly " (6.00 m) sin 40° = 3.86 m
d2y " (8.00 m) sin ($60°) = $6.93 m
d3y " (5.00 m) sin 0° " 0 m.
Equation 3-17 then gives us
dnet,y " #3.86 m $ 6.93 m # 0 m
" $3.07 m.
Next we use these components of 
net to construct the vec-
tor as shown in Fig. 3-16d: the components are in a head-to-
tail arrangement and form the legs of a right triangle, and

Sample Problem 3.03
Searching through a hedge maze
A hedge maze is a maze formed by tall rows of hedge.
After entering, you search for the center point and then
for the exit. Figure 3-16a shows the entrance to such a
maze and the first two choices we make at the junctions
we encounter in moving from point i to point c. We un-
dergo three displacements as indicated in the overhead
view of Fig. 3-16b:
d1 " 6.00 m
11 " 40°
d2 " 8.00 m
12 " 30°
d3 " 5.00 m
13 " 0°,
where the last segment is parallel to the superimposed
x axis. When we reach point c, what are the magnitude and
angle of our net displacement 
net from point i?
KEY IDEAS
(1) To find the net displacement 
net, we need to sum the
three individual displacement vectors:
net "
1 #
2 #
3.
(2) To do this, we first evaluate this sum for the x compo-
nents alone,
dnet,x " dlx # d2x # d3x,
(3-16)
and then the y components alone,
dnet,y " d1y # d2y # d3y.
(3-17)
(3) Finally, we construct 
net from its x and y components.
