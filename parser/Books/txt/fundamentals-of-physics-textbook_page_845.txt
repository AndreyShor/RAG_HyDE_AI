28-5 CYCLOTRONS AND SYNCHROTRONS
KEY IDEAS
(1) The kinetic energy 
of a deuteron exiting the
cyclotron is equal to the kinetic energy it had just before exit-
ing, when it was traveling in a circular path with a radius
approximately equal to the radius R of the cyclotron dees.
(2)We can find the speed v of the deuteron in that circular path
with Eq.28-16 (r ! mv/#q#B).
Calculations: Solving that equation for v, substituting R for
r, and then substituting known data, we find
This speed corresponds to a kinetic energy of

Sample Problem 28.05
Accelerating a charged particle in a cyclotron
Suppose a cyclotron is operated at an oscillator frequency of
12 MHz and has a dee radius R ! 53 cm.
(a) What is the magnitude of the magnetic field needed for
deuterons to be accelerated in the cyclotron? The deuteron
mass is m ! 3.34 $ 10%27 kg (twice the proton mass).
KEY IDEA
For a given oscillator frequency fosc, the magnetic field mag-
nitude B required to accelerate any particle in a cyclotron
depends on the ratio m/
of mass to charge for the particle,
according to Eq. 28-24 (
B
2pmfosc).
Calculation: For deuterons and the oscillator frequency fosc !
12 MHz,we find
(Answer)
Note that, to accelerate protons, B would have to be reduced
by a factor of 2, provided the oscillator frequency remained
fixed at 12 MHz.

then “tune” the cyclotron by varying B until Eq. 28-24 is satisfied, and then many
protons circulate through the magnetic field, to emerge as a beam.
The Proton Synchrotron
At proton energies above 50 MeV, the conventional cyclotron begins to fail because
one of the assumptions of its design—that the frequency of revolution of a charged
particle circulating in a magnetic field is independent of the particle’s speed—is
true only for speeds that are much less than the speed of light. At greater proton
speeds (above about 10% of the speed of light),we must treat the problem relativis-
tically.According to relativity theory,as the speed of a circulating proton approaches
that of light, the proton’s frequency of revolution decreases steadily. Thus, the pro-
ton gets out of step with the cyclotron’s oscillator—whose frequency remains fixed
at f osc—and eventually the energy of the still circulating proton stops increasing.
There is another problem. For a 500 GeV proton in a magnetic field of 1.5 T,
the path radius is 1.1 km.The corresponding magnet for a conventional cyclotron
of the proper size would be impossibly expensive, the area of its pole faces being
about 4 $ 106 m2.
The proton synchrotron is designed to meet these two difficulties.The mag-
netic field B and the oscillator frequency fosc, instead of having fixed values as
in the conventional cyclotron, are made to vary with time during the accelerat-
ing cycle. When this is done properly, (1) the frequency of the circulating pro-
tons remains in step with the oscillator at all times, and (2) the protons follow a
circular—not a spiral—path.Thus, the magnet need extend only along that cir-
cular path, not over some 4 $ 106 m2. The circular path, however, still must be
large if high energies are to be achieved.
