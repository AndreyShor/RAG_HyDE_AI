is  required  for  this  process,  if  the  body,  together  with 
:he  mirrors,  be  moving  relatively  to  the  aether.     And 
another  point :  it  is  shown  by  calculation  that  for 
i  given  velocity  v  with  reference  to  the  aether,  this 
ime  T'  is  different  when  the  body  is  moving  perpen- 
licularly  to  the  planes  of  the  mirrors  from  that  resulting 
vhen  the  motion  is  parallel  to  these  planes.     Although 
he  estimated  difference  between  these  two  times  is 
exceedingly  small,  Michelson  and  Morley  performed  an 
experiment  involving  interference  in  which  this  difference 
should  have  been  clearly  detectable.     But  the  experi 
ment  gave  a  negative  result â€” a  fact  very  perplexing 
:o   physicists.     Lorentz   and    FitzGerald    rescued    the 
:heory  from  this  difficulty  by  assuming  that  the  motion 
)f  the  body  relative  to  the  aether  produces  a  contraction 
Df  the  body  in  the  direction  of  motion,  the  amount  of  con 
traction  being  just  sufficient  to  compensate  for  the  differ- 
snce  in  time  mentioned  above.     Comparison  with  the 
liscussion  in  Section  XII  shows  that  also  from  the  stand 
point  of  the  theory  of  relativity  this  solution  of  the 
difficulty  was  the  right  one.     But  on  the  basis  of  the 
theory  of  relativity  the  method  of  interpretation  is 
incomparably    more    satisfactory.     According    to    this 
theory  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  "  specially  favoured  " 
(unique)  co-ordinate  system  to  occasion  the  introduction 
of  the  aether-idea,  and  hence  there  can  be  no  aether-drift, 
nor  any  experiment   with   which   to   demonstrate   it. 
Here  the  contraction  of  moving  bodies  follows  from 
the  two  fundamental  principles  of  the  theory  without 
the  introduction  of  particular  hypotheses  ;   and  as  the 
prime  factor  involved  in  this  contraction  we  find,  not 
the  motion  in  itself,  to  which  we  cannot  attach  any 
meaning,  but  the  motion  with  respect  to  the  body  of
