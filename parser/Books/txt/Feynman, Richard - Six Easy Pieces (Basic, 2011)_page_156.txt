well call an electron, has come either through hole 1 or through
hole 2. Let us write this in the form of a “Proposition”:
Proposition A: Each electron either goes through hole 1 or it
goes through hole 2.
Assuming Proposition A, all electrons that arrive at the backstop
can be divided into two classes: (1) those that come through hole
1, and (2) those that come through hole 2. So our observed curve
must be the sum of the effects of the electrons which come through
hole 1 and the electrons which come through hole 2. Let us check
this idea by experiment. First, we will make a measurement for
those electrons that come through hole 1. We block off hole 2 and
make our counts of the clicks from the detector. From the clicking
rate, we get P1. The result of the measurement is shown by the
curve marked P1 in part (b) of Fig. 6-3. The result seems quite rea-
sonable. In a similar way, we measure P2, the probability distribu-
tion for the electrons that come through hole 2. The result of this
measurement is also drawn in the ﬁgure.
The result P12 obtained with both holes open is clearly not the
sum of P1 and P2, the probabilities for each hole alone. In analogy
with our water-wave experiment, we say: “There is interference.”
(6.5)
How can such an interference come about? Perhaps we should
say: “Well, that means, presumably, that it is not true that the lumps
go either through hole 1 or hole 2, because if they did, the proba-
bilities should add. Perhaps they go in a more complicated way.
They split in half and . . .” But no! They cannot, they always arrive
in lumps . . . “Well, perhaps some of them go through 1, and then
they go around through 2, and then around a few more times, or
by some other complicated path . . . then by closing hole 2, we
changed the chance that an electron that started out through hole
1 would ﬁnally get to the backstop . . .” But notice! There are some
