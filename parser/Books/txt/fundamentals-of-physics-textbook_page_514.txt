WAVES—II
17-4 INTENSITY AND SOUND LEVEL
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
17.17 Calculate the sound intensity I at a surface as the ratio of
the power P to the surface area A.
17.18 Apply the relationship between the sound intensity I and
the displacement amplitude sm of the sound wave.
17.19 Identify an isotropic point source of sound.
17.20 For an isotropic point source, apply the relationship in-
volving the emitting power Ps, the distance r to a detector,
and the sound intensity I at the detector.
17.21 Apply the relationship between the sound level b,
the sound intensity I, and the standard reference 
intensity I0.
17.22 Evaluate a logarithm function (log) and an antilogarithm
function (log$1).
17.23 Relate the change in a sound level to the change in sound
intensity.
●The intensity I of a sound wave at a surface is the average
rate per unit area at which energy is transferred by the wave
through or onto the surface:
,
where P is the time rate of energy transfer (power) of the
sound wave and A is the area of the surface intercepting
the sound. The intensity I is related to the displacement
amplitude sm of the sound wave by

●The intensity at a distance r from a point source that
emits sound waves of power Ps equally in all directions
(isotropically) is
.
●The sound level b in decibels (dB) is defined as
,
where I0 (# 10$12 W/m2) is a reference intensity level to
which all intensities are compared. For every factor-of-10
increase in intensity, 10 dB is added to the sound level.

one point between a and d at which %L # l (Fig. 17-8e).
From Eq. 17-23, fully constructive interference occurs at
that point.Also, there can be no other point along the way
from point a to point d at which fully constructive inter-
ference occurs, because there is no other integer than 1
between 0 at point a and 1.5 at point d.
We can now use symmetry to locate other points of fully
constructive or destructive interference (Fig.
17-8f ).
Symmetry about line cd gives us point b, at which %L # 0l.
Also, there are three more points at which %L # l. In all
(Fig. 17-8g) we have
N # 6.

Thus, the waves arrive exactly in phase 
and undergo fully constructive interference.
