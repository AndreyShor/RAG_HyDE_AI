Penguin huddling. To withstand the harsh weather of
the Antarctic, emperor penguins huddle in groups (Fig. 18-50).
Assume that a penguin is a circular cylinder with a top surface area
a # 0.34 m2 and height h # 1.1 m. Let Pr be the rate at which an in-
dividual penguin radiates energy to the environment (through the
top and the sides); thus NPr is the rate at which N identical, well-
separated penguins radiate. If the penguins huddle closely to form
a huddled cylinder with top surface area Na and height h, the cylin-
der radiates at the rate Ph. If N # 1000, (a) what is the value of the
fraction Ph/NPr and (b) by what percentage does huddling reduce
the total radiation loss?

Ice has formed on a shallow pond, and a steady state has
been reached, with the air above the ice at $5.0 C and the bottom
of the pond at 4.0 C. If the total depth of ice " water is 1.4 m, how
thick is the ice? (Assume that the thermal conductivities of ice and
water are 0.40 and 0.12 cal/m9C 9s, respectively.)

Evaporative cooling of beverages. A cold beverage
can be kept cold even on a warm day if it is slipped into a porous
ceramic container that has been soaked in water. Assume that en-
ergy lost to evaporation matches the net energy gained via the ra-
diation exchange through the top and side surfaces. The container
and beverage have temperature T # 15 C, the environment has
temperature Tenv # 32 C, and the container is a cylinder with 
radius r # 2.2 cm and height 10 cm. Approximate the emissivity as
´ # 1, and neglect other energy exchanges. At what rate dm/dt is
the container losing water mass?

In the extrusion of cold chocolate from a tube, work is done
on the chocolate by the pressure applied by a ram forcing the
chocolate through the tube. The work per unit mass of extruded
chocolate is equal to p/r, where p is the difference between the ap-
plied pressure and the pressure where the chocolate emerges from
the tube, and r is the density of the chocolate. Rather than increas-
ing the temperature of the chocolate, this work melts cocoa fats in
the chocolate.These fats have a heat of fusion of 150 kJ/kg.Assume
that all of the work goes into that melting and that these fats make
up 30% of the chocolate’s mass. What percentage of the fats melt
during the extrusion if p # 5.5 MPa and r # 1200 kg/m3?

Icebergs in the North Atlantic present hazards to shipping,
causing the lengths of shipping routes to be increased by about 30%
during the iceberg season. Attempts to destroy icebergs include
planting explosives, bombing, torpedoing, shelling, ramming, and
coating with black soot.Suppose that direct melting of the iceberg,by
placing heat sources in the ice, is tried. How much energy as heat is
required to melt 10% of an iceberg that has a mass of 200 000 metric
tons? (Use 1 metric ton # 1000 kg.)

Figure 18-51 displays a closed cycle for
a gas. The change in internal energy along
path ca is $160 J. The energy transferred to
the gas as heat is 200 J along path ab, and 40 J
along path bc. How much work is done by
the gas along (a) path abc and (b) path ab?

In a certain solar house, energy from
the Sun is stored in barrels filled with wa-
ter. In a particular winter stretch of five
cloudy days, 1.00 ' 10 6 kcal is needed
to maintain the inside of the house at
22.0 C. Assuming that the water in the
barrels is at 50.0 C and that the water
has a density of 1.00 ' 10 3 kg/m3, what
volume of water is required?
