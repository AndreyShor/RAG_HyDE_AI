41-3 THE p-n JUNCTION AND THE TRANSISTOR
Dividing both sides by the sample volume V to get the num-
ber density of silicon atoms nSi on the left, we then have
Appendix F tells us that the density of silicon is 2.33 g/cm3
(! 2330 kg/m3) and the molar mass of silicon is 28.1 g/mol
(! 0.0281 kg/mol).Thus, we have
The fraction we seek is approximately
(Answer)
If we replace only one silicon atom in five million with a
phosphorus atom, the number of electrons in the conduc-
tion band will be increased by a factor of a million.
How can such a tiny admixture of phosphorus have what
seems to be such a big effect? The answer is that, although
the effect is very significant, it is not “big.” The number den-
sity of conduction electrons was 1016 m#3 before doping and
1022 m#3 after doping. For copper, however, the conduction-
electron number density (given in Table 41-1) is about
1029 m#3.Thus, even after doping, the number density of con-
duction electrons in silicon remains much less than that of a
typical metal,such as copper,by a factor of about 107.

Sample Problem 41.06
Doping silicon with phosphorus
The number density n0 of conduction electrons in pure
silicon at room temperature is about 1016 m#3.Assume that,
by doping the silicon lattice with phosphorus, we want to
increase this number by a factor of a million (106). What
fraction of silicon atoms must we replace with phosphorus
atoms? (Recall that at room temperature, thermal agitation
is so effective that essentially every phosphorus atom
donates its “extra” electron to the conduction band.)
Number of phosphorus atoms: Because each phosphorus
atom contributes one conduction electron and because we want
the total number density of conduction electrons to be 106n0,
the number density of phosphorus atoms nP must be given by
106n0 ! n0 ' nP.
Then
This tells us that we must add 1022 atoms of phosphorus per
cubic meter of silicon.
Fraction of silicon atoms: We can find the number density
nSi of silicon atoms in pure silicon (before the doping) from
Eq. 41-4, which we can write as

Learning Objectives
●A p-n junction is a single semiconducting crystal with one end
doped to form p-type material and the other end doped to form
n-type material. The two types meet at a junction plane.
●At thermal equilibrium, the following occur at the junction
plane: (1) Majority carriers diffuse across the plane, produc-
ing a diffusion current Idiff. (2) Minority carriers are swept
across the plane, forming a drift current Idrift. (3) A depletion
zone forms at the plane. (4) A contact potential V0 develops
across the depletion zone.
●A p-n junction conducts electricity better for one direction 
of an applied potential difference (forward biased) than for the
opposite direction (back biased), and thus the device can 
serve as a junction rectifier.
●A p-n junction made with certain materials can emit light when
forward biased and thus can serve as a light-emitting diode (LED).
●A light-emitting p-n junction can also be made to emit
stimulated emission and thus can serve as a laser.
