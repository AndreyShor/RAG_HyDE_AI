THE  SOLUTION  OF  THE  PROBLEM  OF  GRAVI 
TATION  ON  THE  BASIS  OF  THE  GENERAL 
PRINCIPLE  OF  RELATIVITY 
IF  
the  reader  has  followed  all  our  previous  con 
siderations,  he  will  have  no  further  difficulty  in 
understanding  the  methods  leading  to  the  solution 
of  the  problem  of  gravitation. 
We  start  off  from  a  consideration  of  a  Galileian 
domain,  i.e.  a  domain  in  which  there  is  no  gravitational 
field  relative  to  the  Galileian  reference-body  K.  The 
behaviour  of  measuring-rods  and  clocks  with  reference 
to  K  is  known  from  the  special  theory  of  relativity, 
likewise  the  behaviour  of  "  isolated  "  material  points ; 
the  latter  move  uniformly  and  in  straight  lines. 
Now  let  us  refer  this  domain  to  a  random  Gauss  co 
ordinate  system  or  to  a  "  mollusk  "  as  reference-body 
K'.  Then  with  respect  to  K'  there  is  a  gravitational 
field  G  (of  a  particular  kind).  We  learn  the  behaviour 
of  measuring-rods  and  clocks  and  also  of  freely-moving 
material  points  with  reference  to  K'  simply  by  mathe 
matical  transformation.  We  interpret  this  behaviour 
as  the  behaviour  of  measuring-rods,  clocks  and  material 
points  under  the  influence  of  the  gravitational  field  G. 
Hereupon  we  introduce  a  hypothesis  :  that  the  in 
fluence  of  the  gravitational  field  on  measuring-rods,
