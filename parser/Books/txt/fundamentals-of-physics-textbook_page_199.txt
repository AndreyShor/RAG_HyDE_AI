the work that our force does on the block.The scale of the figure’s
vertical axis is set by Ws ! 1.0 J. We then pull the block out to x !
"5.0 cm and release it from rest. How much work does the spring
do on the block when the block moves from xi ! "5.0 cm to

In Fig. 7-10a, a block of mass
m lies on a horizontal frictionless
surface and is attached to one end
of a horizontal spring (spring con-
stant k) whose other end is fixed.
The block is initially at rest at the
position 
where 
the 
spring 
is
unstretched (x ! 0) when a con-
stant horizontal force 
in the positive direction of the x axis is ap-
plied to it.A plot of the resulting kinetic energy of the block versus
its position x is shown in Fig. 7-36. The scale of the figure’s vertical
axis is set by Ks ! 4.0 J. (a) What is the magnitude of 
? (b) What
is the value of k?

The only force acting on a 2.0 kg body as it
moves along a positive x axis has an x component Fx
6x N,
with x in meters.The velocity at x ! 3.0 m is 8.0 m/s. (a) What is the
velocity of the body at x ! 4.0 m? (b) At what positive value of x
will the body have a velocity of 5.0 m/s?

Figure 7-37 gives spring force

for the
spring–block arrangement of Fig. 7-

We release the block at x

on the block when the block moves
from xi

The block in Fig. 7-10a lies on a horizontal frictionless
surface, and the spring constant is 50 N/m. Initially, the spring is at
its relaxed length and the block is stationary at position x ! 0.
Then an applied force with a constant magnitude of 3.0 N pulls the
block in the positive direction of the x axis, stretching the spring
until the block stops.When that stopping point is reached, what are
(a) the position of the block, (b) the work that has been done on
the block by the applied force, and (c) the work that has been done
on the block by the spring force? During the block’s displacement,
what are (d) the block’s position when its kinetic energy is maxi-
mum and (e) the value of that maximum kinetic energy?

A 10 kg brick moves along an x axis. Its acceleration as a
function of its position is shown in Fig. 7-38.The scale of the figure’s
vertical axis is set by as ! 20.0 m/s2. What is the net work per-
formed on the brick by the force causing the acceleration as the
brick moves from x ! 0 to x ! 8.0 m?
