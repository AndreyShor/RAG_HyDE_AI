energy. In front of the gun is again a wall (just a thin metal plate)
with two holes in it. Beyond the wall is another plate which will
serve as a “backstop.” In front of the backstop we place a movable
detector. The detector might be a geiger counter or, perhaps better,
an electron multiplier, which is connected to a loudspeaker.
We should say right away that you should not try to set up this
experiment (as you could have done with the two we have already
described). This experiment has never been done in just this way.
The trouble is that the apparatus would have to be made on an im-
possibly small scale to show the effects we are interested in. We are
doing a “thought experiment,” which we have chosen because it is
easy to think about. We know the results that would be obtained
because there are many experiments that have been done, in which
the scale and the proportions have been chosen to show the effects
we shall describe.
The ﬁrst thing we notice with our electron experiment is that
we hear sharp “clicks” from the detector (that is, from the loud-
speaker). And all “clicks” are the same. There are no “half-clicks.”
We would also notice that the “clicks” come very erratically.
Something like: click . . . . . click-click . . . click . . . . . . . . click . . . .
