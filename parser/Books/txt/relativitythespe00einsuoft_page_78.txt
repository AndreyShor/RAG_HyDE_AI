60  GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
or  of  describing  the  motion  involved,  it  is  in  principle 
immaterial  to  what  reference-body  we  refer  the  motion. 
As  already  mentioned,  this  is  self-evident,  but  it  must 
not  be  confused  with  the  much  more  comprehensive 
statement  called  "  the  principle  of  relativity,"  which 
we  have  taken  as  the  basis  of  our  investigations. 
The  principle  we  have  made  use  of  not  only  maintains 
that  we  may  equally  well  choose  the  carriage  or  the 
embankment  as  our  reference-body  for  the  description 
of  any  event  (for  this,  too,  is  self-evident) .  Our  principle 
rather  asserts  what  follows  :  If  we  formulate  the  general 
laws  of  nature  as  they  are  obtained  from  experience, 
by  making  use  of 
(a)  the  embankment  as  reference-body, 
(b)  the  railway  carriage  as  reference-body, 
then  these  general  laws  of  nature  (e.g.  the  laws  of 
mechanics  or  the  law  of  the  propagation  of  light  in  vacua) 
have  exactly  the  same  form  in  both  cases.  This  can 
also  be  expressed  as  follows  :  For  the  physical  descrip 
tion  of  natural  processes,  neither  of  the  reference- 
bodies  K,  K'  is  unique  (lit.  "  specially  marked  out  ")  as 
compared  with  the  other.  Unlike  the  first,  this  latter 
statement  need  not  of  necessity  hold  a  priori ;  it  is 
not  contained  in  the  conceptions  of  "  motion  "  and 
"  reference-body "  and  derivable  from  them ;  only 
experience  can  decide  as  to  its  correctness  or  incor 
rectness. 
Up  to  the  present,  however,  we  have  by  no  means 
maintained  the  equivalence  of  all  bodies  of  reference  K 
in  connection  with  the  formulation  of  natural  laws. 
Our  course  was  more  on  the  following  lines.  In  the 
first  place,  we  started  out  from  the  assumption  that 
there  exists  a  reference-body  K,  whose  condition  of
