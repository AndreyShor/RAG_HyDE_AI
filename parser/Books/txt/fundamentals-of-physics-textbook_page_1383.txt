The Cosmic Background Radiation
In 1965 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, of what was then the Bell Telephone
Laboratories, were testing a sensitive microwave receiver used for commu-
nications research. They discovered a faint background “hiss” that remained
unchanged in intensity no matter where their antenna was pointed. It soon
became clear that Penzias and Wilson were observing a cosmic background
radiation, generated in the early universe and filling all space almost uniformly.
Currently this radiation has a maximum intensity at a wavelength of 1.1 mm,
which lies in the microwave region of electromagnetic radiation (or light, for
short).The wavelength distribution of this radiation matches the wavelength dis-
tribution of light that would be emitted by a laboratory enclosure with walls at a
temperature of 2.7 K. Thus, for the cosmic background radiation, we say that the
enclosure is the entire universe and that the universe is at an (average) tempera-
ture of 2.7 K. For their discovery of the cosmic background radiation, Penzias and
Wilson were awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in physics.
The cosmic background radiation is now known to be light that has been in
flight across the universe since shortly after the universe began billions of years
ago. When the universe was even younger, light could scarcely go any significant
distance without being scattered by all the individual, high-speed particles along
its path. If a light ray started from, say, point A, it would be scattered in so many
directions that if you could have intercepted part of it, you would have not been

Calculation: From Eqs. 44-19 and 44-21, we find
(Answer)
This is only an approximation because the quasar has not
always been receding from our location at the same speed v;
that is, H has not had its current value throughout the time
during which the universe has been expanding.

Sample Problem 44.06
Using Hubble’s law to relate distance and recessional speed
The wavelength shift in the light from a particular quasar indi-
cates that the quasar has a recessional speed of 2.8 " 108 m/s
(which is 93% of the speed of light). Approximately how far
from us is the quasar?
KEY IDEA
We assume that the distance and speed are related by
Hubble’s law.
which leads us to

In this equation,

Substituting this into Eq. 44-24 then gives us

Sample Problem 44.07
Using Hubble’s law to relate distance and Doppler shift
A particular emission line detected in the light from a
galaxy has a detected wavelength ldet ! 1.1l, where l is the
proper wavelength of the line. What is the galaxy’s distance
from us?
KEY IDEAS
(1) We assume that Hubble’s law (v ! Hr) applies to the 
recession of the galaxy. (2) We also assume that the astro-
nomical Doppler shift of Eq. 37-36 (v ! c )l /l, for v ; c)
applies to the shift in wavelength due to the recession.
Calculations: We can then set the right side of these two
equations equal to each other to write
