To find the angle (measured from the positive direction of x),
we take an inverse tangent:

(Answer)
The angle is negative because it is measured clockwise from
positive x.We must always be alert when we take an inverse

tangent on a calculator. The answer it displays is mathe-
matically correct but it may not be the correct answer for
the physical situation. In those cases, we have to add 180°
to the displayed answer, to reverse the vector. To check,
we always need to draw the vector and its components as
we did in Fig. 3-16d. In our physical situation, the figure
shows us that 1 " $12.7° is a reasonable answer, whereas
$12.7° # 180° " 167° is clearly not.
We can see all this on the graph of tangent versus angle
in Fig. 3-12c. In our maze problem, the argument of the in-
verse tangent is $3.07/13.60, or $0.226. On the graph draw
a horizontal line through that value on the vertical axis.The
line cuts through the darker plotted branch at $12.7° and
also through the lighter branch at 167°. The first cut is what
a calculator displays.
3-2 UNIT VECTORS, ADDING VECTORS BY COMPONENTS
KEY IDEA
We can add the three vectors by components, axis by axis,
and then combine the components to write the vector
sum .
Calculations: For the x axis, we add the x components of 
and 
to get the x component of the vector sum
:
rx " ax # bx # cx
" 4.2 m $ 1.6 m # 0 " 2.6 m.
Similarly, for the y axis,
ry " ay # by # cy
" $1.5 m # 2.9 m $ 3.7 m " $2.3 m.
We then combine these components of 
to write the vector
in unit-vector notation:
(Answer)
where (2.6 m)iˆ is the vector component of 
along the x axis
and 
(2.3 m)jˆ is that along the y axis. Figure 3-17b shows
one way to arrange these vector components to form 
.
(Can you sketch the other way?)
We can also answer the question by giving the magnitude
and an angle for .From Eq.3-6,the magnitude is

and the angle (measured from the #x direction) is

where the minus sign means clockwise.

To add these vectors,
find their net x component
and their net y component.
Then arrange the net
components head to tail.
This is the result of the addition.
