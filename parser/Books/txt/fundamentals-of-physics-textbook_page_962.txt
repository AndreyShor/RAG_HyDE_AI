A single loop consists of inductors (L1, L2, . . .), capacitors (C1,
C2, . . .), and resistors (R1, R2, . . .) connected in series as shown, for
example, in Fig. 31-27a. Show that regardless of the sequence of
these circuit elements in the loop, the behavior of this circuit is
identical to that of the simple LC circuit shown in Fig. 31-27b.
(Hint: Consider the loop rule and see Problem 47 in Chapter 30.)

An inductor is connected across a capacitor whose
capacitance can be varied by turning a knob. We wish to make the
frequency of oscillation of this LC circuit vary linearly with the an-
gle of rotation of the knob, going from 2 & 105 to 4 & 105 Hz as the
knob turns through 180°. If L ! 1.0 mH, plot the required capaci-
tance C as a function of the angle of rotation of the knob.

Neglect resistance. (Hint: Use the formulas for equivalent capaci-
tance and equivalent inductance; see Module 25-3 and Problem 47

inductance must be used with a 6.7 mF capacitor to produce a fre-
quency of 10 kHz, which is near the middle of the audible range of

A variable capacitor with a range from 10 to
365 pF is used with a coil to form a variable-frequency LC circuit
to tune the input to a radio. (a) What is the ratio of maximum fre-
quency to minimum frequency that can be obtained with such a
capacitor? If this circuit is to obtain frequencies from 0.54 MHz
to 1.60 MHz, the ratio computed in (a) is too large. By adding a
capacitor in parallel to the variable capacitor, this range can be
adjusted. To obtain the desired frequency range, (b) what capaci-
tance should be added and (c) what inductance should the coil
