WE  
can  characterise  the  Lorentz  transformation 
still  more  simply  if  we  introduce  the  imaginary 
\/  -  i  .  ct  in  place  of  t,  as  time-variable.     If,  in 
accordance  with  this,  we  insert 
__ 
XÂ±  =  J  -I  .Ct, 
and  similarly  for  the  accented  system  K',  then  the 
condition  which  is  identically  satisfied  by  the  trans 
formation  can  be  expressed  thus  : 
That  is,  by  the  afore-mentioned  choice  of  "  co 
ordinates,"  (na)  is  transformed  into  this  equation. 
We  see  from  (12)  that  the  imaginary  time  co-ordinate 
#4  enters  into  the  condition  of  transformation  in  exactly 
the  same  way  as  the  space  co-ordinates  xlt  x2,  x3.  It 
is  due  to  this  fact  that,  according  to  the  theory  of
