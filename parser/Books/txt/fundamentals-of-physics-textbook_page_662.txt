The Electric Field Due to an Electric Dipole
Figure 22-8 shows the pattern of electric field lines for two particles that have
the same charge magnitude q but opposite signs, a very common and important
arrangement known as an electric dipole. The particles are separated by dis-
tance d and lie along the dipole axis, an axis of symmetry around which you can
imagine rotating the pattern in Fig. 22-8. Let’s label that axis as a z axis. Here
we restrict our interest to the magnitude and direction of the electric field 
at
an arbitrary point P along the dipole axis, at distance z from the dipole’s
midpoint.
Figure 22-9a shows the electric fields set up at P by each particle.The nearer
particle with charge #q sets up field E(#) in the positive direction of the z axis (di-
rectly away from the particle). The farther particle with charge %q sets up a
smaller field E(%) in the negative direction (directly toward the particle).We want
the net field at P, as given by Eq. 22-4. However, because the field vectors are
along the same axis, let’s simply indicate the vector directions with plus and mi-
nus signs, as we commonly do with forces along a single axis. Then we can write
the magnitude of the net field at P as
(22-5)
After a little algebra, we can rewrite this equation as
(22-6)
After forming a common denominator and multiplying its terms, we come to
(22-7)
We are usually interested in the electrical effect of a dipole only at distances
that are large compared with the dimensions of the dipole—that is,at distances such
that z ) d.At such large distances,we have d/2z * 1 in Eq.22-7.Thus,in our approx-
imation,we can neglect the d/2z term in the denominator,which leaves us with
(22-8)
The product qd, which involves the two intrinsic properties q and d of the
dipole, is the magnitude p of a vector quantity known as the electric dipole moment
of the dipole.(The unit of 
is the coulomb-meter.) Thus,we can write Eq.22-8 as
(electric dipole).
(22-9)
The direction of 
is taken to be from the negative to the positive end of the
dipole, as indicated in Fig. 22-9b. We can use the direction of 
to specify the
orientation of a dipole.
Equation 22-9 shows that, if we measure the electric field of a dipole only at
distant points, we can never find q and d separately; instead, we can find only
their product. The field at distant points would be unchanged if, for example, q
