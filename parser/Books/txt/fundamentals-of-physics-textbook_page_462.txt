end of the path? (b) Are they then moving in the same direction,
toward each other,or away from each other?

rise and fall a distance d (from highest level to lowest level) in
simple harmonic motion, with a period of 12.5 h. How long does
it take for the water to fall a distance 0.250d from its highest
level?
