Magnetic Field of a Coil
We turn now to the other aspect of a current-carrying coil as a magnetic dipole.
What magnetic field does it produce at a point in the surrounding space? The
problem does not have enough symmetry to make Ampere’s law useful; so we
must turn to the law of Biot and Savart. For simplicity, we first consider only a
coil with a single circular loop and only points on its perpendicular central axis,
which we take to be a z axis. We shall show that the magnitude of the magnetic
field at such points is
(29-26)
in which R is the radius of the circular loop and z is the distance of the point in
question from the center of the loop. Furthermore, the direction of the mag-
netic field 
is the same as the direction of the magnetic dipole moment 
of
the loop.
Large z. For axial points far from the loop, we have z
R in Eq. 29-26.With
that approximation, the equation reduces to
Recalling that pR2 is the area A of the loop and extending our result to include
a coil of N turns, we can write this equation as
Further, because 
and 
have the same direction, we can write the equation in
vector form, substituting from the identity 
NiA:
(current-carrying coil).
(29-27)
Thus, we have two ways in which we can regard a current-carrying coil as a
magnetic dipole: (1) it experiences a torque when we place it in an external
magnetic field; (2) it generates its own intrinsic magnetic field, given, for dis-
tant points along its axis, by Eq. 29-27. Figure 29-22 shows the magnetic field of
a current loop; one side of the loop acts as a north pole (in the direction of )
