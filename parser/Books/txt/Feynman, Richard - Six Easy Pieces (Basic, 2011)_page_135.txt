might make them form little lumps. Barely visible in the ﬁgure are
“little” black spots which may be the beginning of the accumulations
of dust and gases which, due to their gravitation, begin to form stars.
Whether we have ever seen a star form or not is still debatable. Fig-
ure 5-12 shows the one piece of evidence which suggests that we
have. At the left is a picture of a region of gas with some stars in it
taken in 1947, and at the right is another picture, taken only seven
years later, which shows two new bright spots. Has gas accumulated,
has gravity acted hard enough and collected it into a ball big enough
that the stellar nuclear reaction starts in the interior and turns it into
a star? Perhaps, and perhaps not. It is unreasonable that in only seven
years we should be so lucky as to see a star change itself into visible
form; it is much less probable that we should see two!
Cavendish’s experiment
Gravitation, therefore, extends over enormous distances. But if
there is a force between any pair of objects, we ought to be able to
measure the force between our own objects. Instead of having to
