tell the shape, but it must also tell that here is an oxygen atom, there
a hydrogen—exactly what and where each atom is. So we can ap-
preciate that the chemical names must be complex in order to be
complete. You see that the name of this thing in the more complete
form that will tell you the structure of it is 4-(2, 2, 3, 6 tetramethyl-
5-cyclohexenyl)-3-buten-2-one, and that tells you that this is the
arrangement. We can appreciate the difficulties that the chemists
have, and also appreciate the reason for such long names. It is not
that they wish to be obscure, but they have an extremely difficult
problem in trying to describe the molecules in words!
How do we know that there are atoms? By one of the tricks men-
tioned earlier: we make the hypothesis that there are atoms, and one
after the other results come out the way we predict, as they ought
to if things are made of atoms. There is also somewhat more direct
evidence, a good example of which is the following: The atoms are
so small that you cannot see them with a light microscope—in
fact, not even with an electron microscope. (With a light microscope
you can only see things which are much bigger.) Now if the atoms
are always in motion, say in water, and we put a big ball of some-
thing in the water, a ball much bigger than the atoms, the ball will
jiggle around—much as in a push ball game, where a great big ball
is pushed around by a lot of people. The people are pushing in var-
ious directions, and the ball moves around the ﬁeld in an irregular
fashion. So, in the same way, the “large ball” will move because of
