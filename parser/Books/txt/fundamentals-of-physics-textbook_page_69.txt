3-1 VECTORS AND THEIR COMPONENTS
in Fig. 3-7a. The z axis comes directly out of the page at the origin; we ignore it for
now and deal only with two-dimensional vectors.
A component of a vector is the projection of the vector on an axis. In
Fig. 3-7a, for example, ax is the component of vector 
on (or along) the x axis and
ay is the component along the y axis. To find the projection of a vector along an
axis, we draw perpendicular lines from the two ends of the vector to the axis, as
shown.The projection of a vector on an x axis is its x component, and similarly the
projection on the y axis is the y component. The process of finding the
components of a vector is called resolving the vector.
A component of a vector has the same direction (along an axis) as the vector.
In Fig. 3-7, ax and ay are both positive because 
extends in the positive direction
of both axes. (Note the small arrowheads on the components, to indicate their di-
rection.) If we were to reverse vector , then both components would be negative
and their arrowheads would point toward negative x and y. Resolving vector 
in
Fig. 3-8 yields a positive component bx and a negative component by.
In general, a vector has three components, although for the case of Fig. 3-7a
the component along the z axis is zero.As Figs. 3-7a and b show, if you shift a vec-
tor without changing its direction, its components do not change.
Finding the Components. We can find the components of 
in Fig. 3-7a geo-
metrically from the right triangle there:
ax " a cos u
and
ay " a sin u,
(3-5)
where u is the angle that the vector 
makes with the positive direction of the
x axis, and a is the magnitude of . Figure 3-7c shows that 
and its x and y com-
ponents form a right triangle. It also shows how we can reconstruct a vector from
its components: we arrange those components head to tail. Then we complete a
right triangle with the vector forming the hypotenuse, from the tail of one com-
ponent to the head of the other component.
Once a vector has been resolved into its components along a set of axes, the
components themselves can be used in place of the vector. For example,
in
Fig. 3-7a is given (completely determined) by a and u. It can also be given by its
components ax and ay. Both pairs of values contain the same information. If we
know a vector in component notation (ax and ay) and want it in magnitude-angle
notation (a and u), we can use the equations
and
tan 
(3-6)
to transform it.
In the more general three-dimensional case, we need a magnitude and two
angles (say, a, u, and f) or three components (ax, ay, and az) to specify a vector.
