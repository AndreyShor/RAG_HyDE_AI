Spin Magnetic Dipole Moment
As with the orbital angular momentum,a magnetic dipole moment is associated with
the spin angular momentum:
(40-11)
where the minus sign means that the two vectors are in opposite directions, which
is due to the fact that an electron is negatively charged. This 
is an intrinsic
property of every electron.The vector 
does not have a definite direction but it
can have a definite magnitude, given by
(40-12)
The vector can also have a definite component on a z axis, given by
ms,z ! #2msmB,
(40-13)
but that means that it cannot have a definite value of ms,x or ms,y. Figure 40-6
shows the possible values of ms,z. In the next module we shall discuss the early ex-
perimental evidence for the quantized nature in Eq. 40-13.
Shells and Subshells
As we discussed in Module 39-5, all states with the same n form a shell, and all
states with the same value of n and ! form a subshell.As displayed in Table 40-1,for
a given !, there are 2! ' 1 possible values of quantum number m! and, for each m!,
there are two possible values for the quantum number ms (spin up and spin down).
Thus, there are 2(2! ' 1) states in a subshell. If we count all the states throughout a
given shell with quantum number n,we find that the total number in the shell is 2n2.
Orbital and Spin Angular Momenta Combined
For an atom containing more than one electron, we define a total angular
momentum , which is the vector sum of the angular momenta of the individual
electrons—both their orbital and their spin angular momenta. Each element in
the periodic table is defined by the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom
of the element.This number of protons is defined as being the atomic number (or
charge number) Z of the element. Because an electrically neutral atom contains
equal numbers of protons and electrons, Z is also the number of electrons in the
neutral atom, and we use this fact to indicate a 
value for a neutral atom:
(40-14)
Similarly, the total magnetic dipole moment of a multielectron atom is the
vector sum of the magnetic dipole moments (both orbital and spin) of its individ-
ual electrons. However, because of the factor 2 in Eq. 40-13, the resultant
magnetic dipole moment for the atom does not have the direction of vector 
;
instead, it makes a certain angle with that vector. The effective magnetic dipole
moment
for the atom is the component of the vector sum of the individual
magnetic dipole moments in the direction of 
(Fig. 40-7). In typical atoms the
orbital angular momenta and the spin angular momenta of most of the electrons
sum vectorially to zero. Then 
and 
of those atoms are due to a relatively
small number of electrons, often only a single valence electron.
