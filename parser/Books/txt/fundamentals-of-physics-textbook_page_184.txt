CHAPTER 7
KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK
Sample Problem 7.05
Work done on an accelerating elevator cab
An elevator cab of mass m " 500 kg is descending with speed
vi " 4.0 m/s when its supporting cable begins to slip, allowing
it to fall with constant acceleration 
(Fig.7-9a).
(a) During the fall through a distance d " 12 m, what is the
work Wg done on the cab by the gravitational force 
?
KEY IDEA
We can treat the cab as a particle and thus use Eq. 7-12 
(Wg " mgd cos f) to find the work Wg.
Calculation: From Fig. 7-9b, we see that the angle between
the directions of F
:
g and the cab’s displacement is 03.So,
Wg " mgd cos 03 " (500 kg)(9.8 m/s2)(12 m)(1)
" 5.88 ' 104 J % 59 kJ.
(Answer)
(b) During the 12 m fall, what is the work WT done on the
cab by the upward pull 
of the elevator cable?
KEY IDEA
We can calculate work WT with Eq. 7-7 (W " Fd cos f)  by
first writing Fnet,y " may for the components in Fig. 7-9b.
Calculations: We get
T $ Fg " ma.
(7-18)
Solving for T, substituting mg for Fg, and then substituting
the result in Eq. 7-7, we obtain
WT " Td cos f " m(a # g)d cos f.
(7-19)
Next, substituting $g/5 for the (downward) acceleration a
and then 1803 for the angle f between the directions of
forces 
and 
, we find

" $4.70 ' 10 4 J % $47 kJ.

Caution: Note that WT is not simply the negative of Wg be-
cause the cab accelerates during the fall. Thus, Eq. 7-16
(which assumes that the initial and final kinetic energies are
equal) does not apply here.
(c) What is the net work W done on the cab during the fall?
Calculation: The net work is the sum of the works done by
the forces acting on the cab:
W " Wg # WT " 5.88 ' 104 J $ 4.70 ' 10 4 J
" 1.18 ' 104 J % 12 kJ.
(Answer)
(d) What is the cab’s kinetic energy at the end of the 12 m fall?
KEY IDEA
The kinetic energy changes because of the net work done on
the cab, according to Eq. 7-11 (Kf " Ki # W).
Calculation: From Eq. 7-1, we write the initial kinetic
energy as 
.We then write Eq. 7-11 as

Instead of doing this, we can apply Newton’s second law for
motion along the x axis to find the magnitude FT of the rope’s
force. Assuming that the acceleration along the slope is zero
(except for the brief starting and stopping),we can write
Fnet,x " max,
FT $ mg sin 303 " m(0),
to find
FT " mg sin 303.
This is the magnitude. Because the force and the displace-
ment are both up the slope, the angle between those two
vectors is zero. So, we can now write Eq. 7-7 to find the work
done by the rope’s force:
WT " FTd cos 03 " (mg sin 303)d cos 03
" (200 kg)(9.8 m/s2)(sin 303)(20 m) cos 03
" 1.96 ' 104 J.
