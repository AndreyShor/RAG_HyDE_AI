Assume also that a spherical pollen grain of diameter 40.0 mm is
electrically held on the surface of the bee because the bee’s charge
induces a charge of %1.00 pC on the near side of the grain and a

Suppose you design an appa-
ratus in which a uniformly charged
disk of radius R is to produce an
electric field. The field magnitude is
most important along the central
perpendicular axis of the disk, at a
point P at distance 2.00R from the
disk (Fig. 22-57a). Cost analysis sug-
gests that you switch to a ring of the
same outer radius R but with inner
radius R/2.00 (Fig. 22-57b).Assume
that the ring will have the same sur-
face charge density as the original disk. If you switch to the ring, by
what percentage will you decrease the electric field magnitude at P?
