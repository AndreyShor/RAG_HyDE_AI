then in a direction 50.0° east of due north for 20.0 min, and then
west for 50.0 min. What are the (a) magnitude and (b) angle of its
average velocity during this trip?

,

A plane flies 483 km east from city A to city B in 45.0 min and
then 966 km south from city B to city C in 1.50 h. For the total trip,
what are the (a) magnitude and (b) direction of the plane’s dis-
placement, the (c) magnitude
and (d) direction of its aver-
age velocity, and (e) its aver-

Figure 4-30 gives the
path of a squirrel moving
about on level ground, from
point A (at time t " 0), to
points B (at t " 5.00 min), C
(at t " 10.0 min), and finally D
(at t " 15.0 min). Consider the
average velocities of the squir-
rel from point A to each of the
other three points. Of them,
