36-6 GRATINGS: DISPERSION AND RESOLVING POWER
If we substitute 2uhw as given here for 2u in Eq. 36-33, we find that
from which it readily follows that
This is Eq. 36-32, which we set out to derive.
Dispersion and Resolving Power Compared
The resolving power of a grating must not be confused with its dispersion.
Table 36-1 shows the characteristics of three gratings, all illuminated with light of
wavelength l ! 589 nm, whose diffracted light is viewed in the first order (m ! 1
in Eq. 36-25). You should verify that the values of D and R as given in the table
can be calculated with Eqs. 36-30 and 36-32, respectively. (In the calculations for
D, you will need to convert radians per meter to degrees per micrometer.)
For the conditions noted in Table 36-1, gratings A and B have the same
dispersion D and A and C have the same resolving power R.
Figure 36-26 shows the intensity patterns (also called line shapes) that would
be produced by these gratings for two lines of wavelengths l1 and l2, in the
vicinity of l ! 589 nm. Grating B, with the higher resolving power, produces
narrower lines and thus is capable of distinguishing lines that are much closer
together in wavelength than those in the figure. Grating C, with the higher dis-
persion, produces the greater angular separation between the lines.

Sample Problem 36.06
Dispersion and resolving power of a diffraction grating
A diffraction grating has 1.26
104 rulings uniformly spaced
(
over width w ! 25.4 mm. It is illuminated at normal inci-
dence by yellow light from a sodium vapor lamp. This light
contains two closely spaced emission lines (known as the
sodium doublet) of wavelengths 589.00 nm and 589.59 nm.
(a) At what angle does the first-order maximum occur (on
either side of the center of the diffraction pattern) for the
wavelength of 589.00 nm?
KEY IDEA
The maxima produced by the diffraction grating can be deter-
mined with Eq.36-25 (d sin u ! ml).
