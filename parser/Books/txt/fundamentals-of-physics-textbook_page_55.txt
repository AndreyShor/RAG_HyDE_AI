Graphical Integration in Motion Analysis
Integrating Acceleration. When we have a graph of an object’s acceleration a ver-
sus time t, we can integrate on the graph to find the velocity at any given time.
Because a is defined as a " dv/dt,the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that
(2-27)
The right side of the equation is a definite integral (it gives a numerical result rather
than a function),v0 is the velocity at time t0,and v1 is the velocity at later time t1.The def-
inite integral can be evaluated from an a(t) graph,such as in Fig.2-14a.In particular,
(2-28)
If a unit of acceleration is 1 m/s2 and a unit of time is 1 s, then the correspon-
ding unit of area on the graph is
(1 m/s2)(1 s) " 1 m/s,
which is (properly) a unit of velocity.When the acceleration curve is above the time
axis,the area is positive;when the curve is below the time axis,the area is negative.
Integrating Velocity. Similarly,because velocity v is defined in terms of the posi-
tion x as v " dx/dt,then
(2-29)
where x0 is the position at time t0 and x1 is the position at time t1. The definite
integral on the right side of Eq. 2-29 can be evaluated from a v(t) graph, like that
shown in Fig. 2-14b. In particular,
(2-30)
If the unit of velocity is 1 m/s and the unit of time is 1 s, then the corre-
sponding unit of area on the graph is
(1 m/s)(1 s) " 1 m,
which is (properly) a unit of position and displacement.Whether this area is posi-
tive or negative is determined as described for the a(t) curve of Fig. 2-14a.
