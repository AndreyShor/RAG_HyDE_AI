energy. For example, the (1, 2) and (2, 1) states both have an
energy of 5(h2/8mL2).Each such pair is associated with degen-
erate energy levels. Note also that, perhaps surprisingly, the
(4,1) and (1,4) states have less energy than the (3,3) state.
From Table 39-1 (carefully keeping track of degenerate
levels),we can construct the energy-level diagram of Fig.39-15.
(b) As a multiple of h2/8mL2, what is the energy difference
between the ground state and the third excited state?
Energy difference: From Fig. 39-15, we see that the ground
state is the (1, 1) state, with an energy of 2(h2/8mL2).We also
see that the third excited state (the third state up from the
ground state in the energy-level diagram) is the degenerate
(1, 3) and (3, 1) states, with an energy of 10(h2/8mL2). Thus,
the difference )E between these two states is

Sample Problem 39.05
Energy levels in a 2D infinite potential well
An electron is trapped in a square corral that is a two-
dimensional infinite potential well (Fig. 39-13) with widths
Lx ! Ly.
(a) Find the energies of the lowest five possible energy levels
for this trapped electron, and construct the corresponding
energy-level diagram.
KEY IDEA
Because the electron is trapped in a two-dimensional well
that is rectangular, the electron’s energy depends on two
quantum numbers, nx and ny, according to Eq. 39-20.
Energy levels: Because the well here is square, we can let the
widths be Lx ! Ly ! L.Then Eq.39-20 simplifies to
(39-22)
The lowest energy states correspond to low values of the
quantum numbers nx and ny, which are the positive integers
1, 2, . . . , ,. Substituting those integers for nx and ny in
Eq. 39-22, starting with the lowest value 1, we can obtain the
energy values as listed in Table 39-1. There we can see that
several of the pairs of quantum numbers (nx, ny) give the same

states may have the same energy.
