Gauss’ Law for Magnetic Fields
•1
The magnetic flux through each of five faces of a die (singular
of “dice”) is given by #B ! .N Wb, where N (! 1 to 5) is the num-
ber of spots on the face. The flux is positive (outward) for N even
and negative (inward) for N odd.What is the flux through the sixth
face of the die?
•2
Figure 32-27 shows a closed surface.Along
the flat top face, which has a radius of 2.0 cm, a
perpendicular magnetic field 
of magnitude
0.30 T is directed outward. Along the flat bot-
tom face, a magnetic flux of 0.70 mWb is
directed outward. What are the (a) magnitude
and (b) direction (inward or outward) of
the magnetic flux through the curved part of
the surface?
••3
A Gaussian surface in the shape
of a right circular cylinder with end caps has a radius of 12.0 cm
and a length of 80.0 cm. Through one end there is an inward mag-
netic flux of 25.0 mWb. At the other end there is a uniform mag-
netic field of 1.60 mT, normal to the surface and directed outward.
What are the (a) magnitude and (b) direction (inward or outward)
of the net magnetic flux through the curved surface?
•••4
Two wires, parallel to a
z axis and a distance 4r apart,
carry equal currents i in oppo-
site directions, as shown in
Fig. 32-28.A circular cylinder of
radius r and length L has its
axis on the z axis, midway be-
tween the wires. Use Gauss’ law
for magnetism to derive an ex-
pression for the net outward
magnetic flux through the half of the cylindrical surface above the
x axis. (Hint: Find the flux through the portion of the xz plane that
lies within the cylinder.)
