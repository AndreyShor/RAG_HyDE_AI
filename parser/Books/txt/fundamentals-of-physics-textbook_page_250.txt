Linear Momentum
Here we discuss only a single particle instead of a system of particles, in order to
define two important quantities. Then we shall extend those definitions to sys-
tems of many particles.
The first definition concerns a familiar word—momentum—that has several
meanings in everyday language but only a single precise meaning in physics and
engineering. The linear momentum of a particle is a vector quantity 
that is
defined as
(linear momentum of a particle),
(9-22)
in which m is the mass of the particle and is its velocity. (The adjective linear is of-
ten dropped, but it serves to distinguish 
from angular momentum, which is intro-
duced in Chapter 11 and which is associated with rotation.) Since m is always a
positive scalar quantity, Eq. 9-22 tells us that

CHAPTER 9
CENTER OF MASS AND LINEAR MOMENTUM
9-3 LINEAR MOMENTUM
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
9.13 Identify that momentum is a vector quantity and thus has
both magnitude and direction and also components.
9.14 Calculate the (linear) momentum of a particle as the
product of the particle’s mass and velocity.
9.15 Calculate the change in momentum (magnitude and di-
rection) when a particle changes its speed and direction of
travel.
9.16 Apply the relationship between a particle’s momentum
and the (net) force acting on the particle.
9.17 Calculate the momentum of a system of particles as the
product of the system’s total mass and its center-of-mass
velocity.
9.18 Apply the relationship between a system’s center-of-
mass momentum and the net force acting on the system.
●For a single particle, we define a quantity 
called its linear
momentum as
,
which is a vector quantity that has the same direction as the
particle’s velocity. We can write Newton’s second law in

Key Ideas
The time rate of change of the momentum of a particle is equal to the net force 
acting on the particle and is in the direction of that force.
In equation form this becomes
(9-23)
In words, Eq. 9-23 says that the net external force 
on a particle changes the
particle’s linear momentum 
Conversely, the linear momentum can be
changed only by a net external force. If there is no net external force,
cannot
change. As we shall see in Module 9-5, this last fact can be an extremely power-
ful tool in solving problems.
