SPACE  AND  TIME   IN   CLASSICAL  MECHANICS 
THE  purpose  of   mechanics   is   to  describe   how 
bodies    change    their    position    in    space    with 
time."     I  should  load  my  conscience  with  grave 
sins  against   the  sacred  spirit    of    lucidity  were   I  to 
formulate  the  aims  of  mechanics  in  this  way,  without 
serious  reflection  and  detailed   explanations.      Let  us 
proceed  to  disclose  these  sins. 
It  is  not  clear  what  is  to  be  understood  here  by 
"  position  "  and  "  space."  I  stand  at  the  window  of  a 
railway  carriage  which  is  travelling  uniformly,  and  drop 
a  stone  on  the  embankment,  without  throwing  it.  Then, 
disregarding  the  influence  of  the  air  resistance,  I  see  the 
stone  descend  in  a  straight  line.  A  pedestrian  who 
observes  the  misdeed  from  the  footpath  notices  that  the 
stone  falls  to  earth  in  a  parabolic  curve.  I  now  ask  : 
Do  the  "  positions  "  traversed  by  the  stone  lie  "  in 
reality  "  on  a  straight  line  or  on  a  parabola  ?  Moreover, 
what  is  meant  here  by  motion  "  in  space  "  ?  From  the 
considerations  of  the  previous  section  the  answer  is 
self-evident.  In  the  first  place,  we  entirely  shun  the 
vague  word  "  space,"  of  which,  we  must  honestly 
acknowledge,  we  cannot  form  the  slightest  concep 
tion,  and  we  replace  it  by  "  motion  relative  to  a 
practically  rigid  body  of  reference."  The  positions 
relative  to  the  body  of  reference  (railway  carriage  or 
embankment)  have  already  been  defined  in  detail  in  the
