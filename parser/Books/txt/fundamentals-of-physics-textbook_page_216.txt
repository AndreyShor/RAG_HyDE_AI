Equilibrium Points
Figure 8-9f shows three different values for Emec superposed on the plot of the
potential energy function U(x) of Fig. 8-9a. Let us see how they change the situa-
tion. If Emec ! 4.0 J (purple line), the turning point shifts from x1 to a point
between x1 and x2. Also, at any point to the right of x5, the system’s mechanical
energy is equal to its potential energy; thus, the particle has no kinetic energy and
(by Eq. 8-22) no force acts on it, and so it must be stationary.A particle at such a
position is said to be in neutral equilibrium. (A marble placed on a horizontal
tabletop is in that state.)
If Emec ! 3.0 J (pink line), there are two turning points: One is between
x1 and x2, and the other is between x4 and x5. In addition, x3 is a point at which
K ! 0. If the particle is located exactly there, the force on it is also zero, and the
particle remains stationary. However, if it is displaced even slightly in either
direction, a nonzero force pushes it farther in the same direction, and the particle
continues to move. A particle at such a position is said to be in unstable equilib-
rium. (A marble balanced on top of a bowling ball is an example.)
Next consider the particle’s behavior if Emec ! 1.0 J (green line). If we place it
at x4, it is stuck there. It cannot move left or right on its own because to do so would
require a negative kinetic energy. If we push it slightly left or right, a restoring force
appears that moves it back to x4.A particle at such a position is said to be in stable
equilibrium. (A marble placed at the bottom of a hemispherical bowl is an example.)
If we place the particle in the cup-like potential well centered at x2,it is between two
turning points.It can still move somewhat,but only partway to x1 or x3.

Sample Problem 8.04
Reading a potential energy graph
A 2.00 kg particle moves along an x axis in one-dimensional
motion while a conservative force along that axis acts on it.
The potential energy U(x) associated with the force is plot-
ted in Fig. 8-10a. That is, if the particle were placed at any
position between 
and 
, it would have the
plotted value of U. At 
, the particle has velocity

.
KEY IDEAS
(1) The particle’s kinetic energy is given by Eq. 7-1
(
). (2) Because only a conservative force acts on
the particle, the mechanical energy 
is con-
served as the particle moves. (3) Therefore, on a plot of U(x)
such as Fig. 8-10a, the kinetic energy is equal to the differ-
ence between 
and U.
