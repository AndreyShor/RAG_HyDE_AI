41-1 THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS
The Fermi energy of a given material is the energy of a quantum state that has
the probability 0.5 of being occupied by an electron.
Figure 41-7b is a plot of P(E) for T ! 1000 K. Compared with Fig. 41-7a, it
shows that, as stated above, changes in the distribution of electrons among the
available states involve only states whose energies are near the Fermi energy EF.
Note that if E ! EF (no matter what the temperature T), the exponential term in
Eq. 41-6 is e0 ! 1 and P(E) ! 0.5.This leads us to a more useful definition of the
Fermi energy:
(b) What is the probability of occupancy for a state that is
0.10 eV below the Fermi energy?
Calculation: The Key Idea of part (a) applies here also
except that now the state has an energy below the Fermi
energy. Thus, the exponent in Eq. 41-6 has the same magni-
tude we found in part (a) but is negative, and that makes the
denominator smaller. Equation 41-6 now yields
(Answer)
For states below the Fermi energy, we are often more in-
terested in the probability that the state is not occupied.
This probability is just 1 # P(E), or 19%. Note that it is the
same as the probability of occupancy in (a).

Sample Problem 41.04
Probability of occupancy of an energy state in a metal
(a) What is the probability that a quantum state whose
energy is 0.10 eV above the Fermi energy will be occupied?
Assume a sample temperature of 800 K.
KEY IDEA
The occupancy probability of any state in a metal can be
found from Fermi–Dirac statistics according to Eq. 41-6.
Calculations: Let’s start with the exponent in Eq. 41-6:
Inserting this exponent into Eq. 41-6 yields

Figures 41-7a and b are plotted for copper, which has a Fermi energy of
7.0 eV. Thus, for copper both at T ! 0 K and at T ! 1000 K, a state at energy 
E ! 7.0 eV has a probability of 0.5 of being occupied.
How Many Occupied States Are There?
Equation 41-5 and Fig. 41-6 tell us how the available states are distributed in
energy. The occupancy probability of Eq. 41-6 gives us the probability that any
given state will actually be occupied by an electron.To find No(E), the density of
occupied states, we must multiply each available state by the corresponding value
of the occupancy probability; that is,
or
No(E) ! N(E) P(E)
(density of occupied states).
(41-7)
For copper at T ! 0 K, Eq. 41-7 tells us to multiply, at each energy, the value
of the density of states function (Eq. 41-6) by the value of the occupancy proba-
