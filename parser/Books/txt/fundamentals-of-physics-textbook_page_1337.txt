43-1 NUCLEAR FISSION
The puzzle was solved within a few weeks by Meitner and her nephew Otto
Frisch.They suggested the mechanism by which a uranium nucleus,having absorbed
a thermal neutron, could split, with the release of energy, into two roughly equal
parts,one of which might well be barium.Frisch named the process fission.
Meitner’s central role in the discovery of fission was not fully recognized until
recent historical research brought it to light. She did not share in the Nobel Prize
in chemistry that was awarded to Otto Hahn in 1944. However, in 1997 Meitner
was (finally) honored by having an element named after her: meitnerium (symbol
Mt, Z ! 109).
A Closer Look at Fission
Figure 43-1 shows the distribution by mass number of the fragments produced
when 235U is bombarded with thermal neutrons. The most probable mass num-
bers, occurring in about 7% of the events, are centered around A % 95 and A %
140. Curiously, the “double-peaked” character of Fig. 43-1 is still not understood.
In a typical 235U fission event, a 235U nucleus absorbs a thermal neutron,
producing a compound nucleus 236U in a highly excited state. It is this nucleus
that actually undergoes fission, splitting into two fragments. These fragments—
between them—rapidly emit two neutrons, leaving (in a typical case) 140Xe
(Z ! 54) and 94Sr (Z ! 38) as fission fragments. Thus, the stepwise fission equa-
tion for this event is
(43-1)
Note that during the formation and fission of the compound nucleus, there is
conservation of the number of protons and of the number of neutrons involved
in the process (and thus conservation of their total number and the net charge).
In Eq. 43-1, the fragments 140Xe and 94Sr are both highly unstable, under-
going beta decay (with the conversion of a neutron to a proton and the emission
of an electron and a neutrino) until each reaches a stable end product. For xenon,
the decay chain is
