ber of diffraction minima in the pat-
tern (count them on both sides of

Monochromatic light with wavelength 538 nm is incident on a
slit with width 0.025 mm. The distance from the slit to a screen is 3.5
m. Consider a point on the screen 1.1 cm from the central maximum.
Calculate (a) u for that point,(b) a,and (c) the ratio of the intensity at
that point to the intensity at the central maximum.

In the single-slit diffraction experiment of Fig.36-4,let the wave-
length of the light be 500 nm, the slit width be 6.00 mm, and the view-
ing screen be at distance D ! 3.00 m. Let a y axis extend upward
along the viewing screen,with its origin at the center of the diffraction
pattern. Also let IP represent the intensity of the diffracted light at
point P at y ! 15.0 cm. (a) What is the ratio of IP to the intensity Im at
the center of the pattern? (b) Determine where point P is in the dif-
fraction pattern by giving the maximum and minimum between
which it lies,or the two minima between which it lies.
••15
The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of a
central diffraction maximum is defined as the angle between the two
points in the pattern where the intensity is one-half that at the center
of the pattern. (See Fig. 36-8b.) (a) Show that the intensity drops to
one-half the maximum value when sin2 a ! a2/2. (b) Verify that a !
1.39 rad (about 80°) is a solution to the transcendental equation of
(a).(c) Show that the FWHM is 2u ! 2 sin&1(0.443l/a),where a is the
slit width.Calculate the FWHM of the central maximum for slit width
(d) 1.00l,(e) 5.00l,and (f) 10.0l.

Babinet’s 
principle.
A
monochromatic beam of paral-
lel light is incident on a “colli-
mating” hole of diameter 
.
Point P lies in the geometrical
shadow region on a distant
screen (Fig. 36-39a). Two dif-
fracting objects, shown in Fig.
36-39b, are placed in turn over
the collimating hole. Object A is
an opaque circle with a hole in
it, and B is the “photographic
negative” of A. Using superpo-
sition concepts, show that the
intensity at P is identical for the
two diffracting objects A and B.
••17
(a) Show that the values
of a at which intensity maxima
for single-slit diffraction occur can be found exactly by differenti-
ating Eq. 36-5 with respect to a and equating the result to zero, ob-
taining the condition tan a ! a. To find values of a satisfying this
relation, plot the curve y ! tan a and the straight line y ! a and
then find their intersections, or use a calculator to find an appro-
priate value of a by trial and error. Next, from 
, de-
termine the values of m associated with the maxima in the single-
slit pattern. (These m values are not integers because secondary
maxima do not lie exactly halfway between minima.) What are the
(b) smallest a and (c) associated m, the (d) second smallest a and
(e) associated m, and the (f) third smallest a and (g) associated m?

Monochromatic light of wavelength 441 nm is incident on a
narrow slit. On a screen 2.00 m away, the distance between the
second diffraction minimum and the central maximum is 1.50 cm.

Light of wavelength 633 nm is incident on a narrow slit. The
angle between the first diffraction minimum on one side of the
central maximum and the first minimum on the other side is 1.20°.

Sound waves with frequency
3000 Hz and speed 343 m/s diffract
through the rectangular opening of
a speaker cabinet and into a large
auditorium of length d ! 100 m.The
opening, which has a horizontal
width of 30.0 cm, faces a wall 100 m
away (Fig. 36-36). Along that wall,
how far from the central axis will a
listener be at the first diffraction minimum and thus have difficulty
hearing the sound? (Neglect reflections.)

A slit 1.00 mm wide is illuminated by light of wave-
length 589 nm. We see a diffraction pattern on a screen 3.00 m
away.What is the distance between the first two diffraction minima
on the same side of the central diffraction maximum?

Manufacturers of wire (and other objects of small
dimension) sometimes use a laser to continually monitor the
thickness of the product. The wire intercepts the laser beam, pro-
ducing a diffraction pattern like that of a single slit of the same
width as the wire diameter (Fig. 36-37). Suppose a helium–neon
laser, of wavelength 632.8 nm, illuminates a wire, and the diffrac-
tion pattern appears on a screen at distance L ! 2.60 m. If the
desired wire diameter is 1.37 mm, what is the observed distance
between the two tenth-order minima (one on each side of the
central maximum)?

A 0.10-mm-wide slit is illuminated by light of wavelength
589 nm. Consider a point P on a viewing screen on which the dif-
fraction pattern of the slit is viewed; the point is at 30° from the
central axis of the slit. What is the phase difference between the
Huygens wavelets arriving at point P from the top and midpoint of
the slit? (Hint: See Eq. 36-4.)
