Identical isolated conducting spheres 1 and 2 have equal
charges and are separated by a distance that is large compared with
their diameters (Fig. 21-22a). The electrostatic force acting on
sphere 2 due to sphere 1 is 
. Suppose now that a third identical
sphere 3, having an insulating handle and initially neutral, is
touched first to sphere 1 (Fig.21-22b),then to sphere 2 (Fig.21-22c),
and finally removed (Fig. 21-22d). The electrostatic force that now
acts on sphere 2 has magnitude F,.What is the ratio F,/F?

Two identical conducting spheres, fixed in
place, attract each other with an electrostatic force of 0.108 N when
their center-to-center separation is 50.0 cm. The spheres are then
connected by a thin conducting wire. When the wire is removed,
the spheres repel each other with an electrostatic force of 0.0360 N.
Of the initial charges on the spheres, with a positive net charge,
what was (a) the negative charge on one of them and (b) the posi-
tive charge on the other?

Two equally charged particles are held 3.2 ' 10$3 m apart and
then released from rest. The initial acceleration of the first particle is
observed to be 7.0 m/s2 and that of the second to be 9.0 m/s2. If the
mass of the first particle is 6.3 ' 10$7 kg, what are (a) the mass of the
second particle and (b) the magnitude of the charge of each particle?

In Fig. 21-23, three charged
particles lie on an x axis. Particles

In Fig. 21-24, three identical conducting spheres initially have
the following charges: sphere A, 4Q; sphere B, $6Q; and sphere
C, 0. Spheres A and B are fixed in place, with a center-to-center
separation that is much larger than the spheres. Two experiments
are conducted. In experiment 1,
sphere C is touched to sphere A
and then (separately) to sphere B,
and then it is removed. In experi-
ment 2, starting with the same
initial states, the procedure is re-
versed: Sphere C is touched to
sphere B and then (separately) to
sphere A, and then it is removed.
