sodium is positive and the oxygen end of the water is negative, and
they attract electrically. Can we tell from this picture whether the
salt is dissolving in water or crystallizing out of water? Of course we
cannot tell, because while some of the atoms are leaving the crystal
other atoms are rejoining it. The process is a dynamic one, just as in
the case of evaporation, and it depends on whether there is more or
less salt in the water than the amount needed for equilibrium. By
equilibrium we mean that situation in which the rate at which atoms
are leaving just matches the rate at which they are coming back. If
there is almost no salt in the water, more atoms leave than return,
and the salt dissolves. If, on the other hand, there are too many “salt
atoms,” more return than leave, and the salt is crystallizing.
In passing, we mention that the concept of a molecule of a sub-
stance is only approximate and exists only for a certain class of sub-
stances. It is clear in the case of water that the three atoms are
actually stuck together. It is not so clear in the case of sodium chlo-
ride in the solid. There is just an arrangement of sodium and chlo-
rine ions in a cubic pattern. There is no natural way to group them
as “molecules of salt.”
Returning to our discussion of solution and precipitation, if we
increase the temperature of the salt solution, then the rate at which
