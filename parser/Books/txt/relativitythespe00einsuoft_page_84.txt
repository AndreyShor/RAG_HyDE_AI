THE  EQUALITY  OF  INERTIAL  AND  GRAVITA 
TIONAL  MASS  AS  AN  ARGUMENT  FOR  THE 
GENERAL  POSTULATE  OF  RELATIVITY 
WE  imagine  a  large  portion  of  empty  space,  so  far 
removed  from  stars  and  other  appreciable 
masses,  that  we  have  before  us  approximately 
the  conditions  required  by  the  fundamental  law  of  Galilei. 
It  is  then  possible  to  choose  a  Galileian  reference-body  for 
this  part  of  space  (world),  relative  to  which  points  at 
rest  remain  at  rest  and  points  in  motion  continue  per 
manently  in  uniform  rectilinear  motion.  As  reference- 
body  let  us  imagine  a  spacious  chest  resembling  a  room 
with  an  observer  inside  who  is  equipped  with  apparatus. 
Gravitation  naturally  does  not  exist  for  this  observer. 
He  must  fasten  himself  with  strings  to  the  floor, 
otherwise  the  slightest  impact  against  the  floor  will 
cause  him  to  rise  slowly  towards  the  ceiling  of  the 
room. 
To  the  middle  of  the  lid  of  the  chest  is  fixed  externally 
a  hook  with  rope  attached,  and  now  a  "  being  "  (what 
kind  of  a  being  is  immaterial  to  us)  begins  pulling  at 
this  with  a  constant  force.  The  chest  together  with  the 
observer  then  begin  to  move  "  upwards  "  with  a 
uniformly  accelerated  motion.  In  course  of  time  their 
velocity  will  reach  unheard-of  values â€” provided  that
