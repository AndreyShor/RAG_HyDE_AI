Projectile Motion
Projectile motion is the motion of a particle
that is launched with an initial velocity 
. During its flight, the par-
ticle’s horizontal acceleration is zero and its vertical acceleration is
the free-fall acceleration $g. (Upward is taken to be a positive di-
rection.) If 
is expressed as a magnitude (the speed v0) and an an-
gle u0 (measured from the horizontal), the particle’s equations of
motion along the horizontal x axis and vertical y axis are

Questions

Figure 4-21 shows the path taken by
a skunk foraging for trash food, from
initial point i. The skunk took the same
time T to go from each labeled point to
the next along its path. Rank points a, b,
and c according to the magnitude of the
average velocity of the skunk to reach
them from initial point i, greatest first.

Figure 4-22 shows the initial posi-
tion i and the final position f of a parti-
cle. What are the (a) initial position
vector 
and (b) final position vector , both in unit-vector nota-

twice as long as at 45º. Does that result mean that the air density at
high altitudes increases with altitude or decreases?

You are to launch a rocket, from just above the ground, with
one of the following initial velocity vectors: (1) 
,
(2) 
, (3) 
, (4) 
. In
your coordinate system, x runs along level ground and y increases
upward. (a) Rank the vectors according to the launch speed of the
projectile, greatest first. (b) Rank the vectors according to the time
of flight of the projectile, greatest first.

Figure 4-23 shows three situations in which identical projectiles
are launched (at the same level) at identical initial speeds and an-
gles. The projectiles do not land on the same terrain, however.
Rank the situations according to the final speeds of the projectiles
just before they land, greatest first.

Uniform Circular Motion
If a particle travels along a circle or
circular arc of radius r at constant speed v, it is said to be in uniform
circular motion and has an acceleration 
of constant magnitude
(4-34)
The direction of 
is toward the center of the circle or circular arc,
and 
is said to be centripetal. The time for the particle to complete
a circle is
.
(4-35)
T is called the period of revolution, or simply the period, of the
motion.
Relative Motion
When two frames of reference A and B are
moving relative to each other at constant velocity,the velocity of a par-
ticle P as measured by an observer in frame A usually differs from that
measured from frame B.The two measured velocities are related by
(4-44)
where 
is the velocity of B with respect to A. Both observers
measure the same acceleration for the particle:

and is given by

range R, which is the horizontal distance from the launch point to

When Paris was shelled from 100 km away with the WWI
long-range artillery piece “Big Bertha,” the shells were fired at an
angle greater than 45º to give them a greater range, possibly even
