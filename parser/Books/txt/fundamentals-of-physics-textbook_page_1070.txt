Figure 34-56 shows a beam ex-
pander made with two coaxial con-
verging lenses of focal lengths f1 and
f2 and separation d ! f1 ' f2.The de-
vice can expand a laser beam while
keeping the light rays in the beam
parallel to the central axis through
the lenses. Suppose a uniform laser
beam of width Wi ! 2.5 mm and in-
tensity Ii ! 9.0 kW/m2 enters a beam expander for which f1 ! 12.5
cm and f2 ! 30.0 cm.What are (a) Wf and (b) If of the beam leaving
the expander? (c) What value of d is needed for the beam
expander if lens 1 is replaced with a diverging lens of focal length 
f1 ! &26.0 cm?

You look down at a coin that
lies at the bottom of a pool of liquid
of depth d and index of refraction n
(Fig. 34-57). Because you view with
two eyes, which intercept different
rays of light from the coin, you per-
ceive 
the 
coin 
to 
be 
where
extensions of the intercepted rays
cross, at depth da instead of d.
Assuming that the intercepted rays
in Fig. 34-57 are close to a vertical
axis through the coin, show that da
! d/n. (Hint: Use the small-angle
approximation sin u % tan u % u.)
113
A pinhole camera has the
hole a distance 12 cm from the film plane, which is a rectangle of
height 8.0 cm and width 6.0 cm. How far from a painting of dimen-
sions 50 cm by 50 cm should the camera be placed so as to get the
largest complete image possible on the film plane?
114
Light travels from point A to point B via reflection at point
O on the surface of a mirror. Without using calculus, show that
length AOB is a minimum when the angle of incidence u is equal
to the angle of reflection f. (Hint: Consider the image of A in the
mirror.)
107
A fruit fly of height H sits in front of lens 1 on the cen-
tral axis through the lens. The lens forms an image of the fly at a
distance d ! 20 cm from the fly; the image has the fly’s orientation
and height HI ! 2.0H. What are (a) the focal length f1 of the lens
and (b) the object distance p1 of the fly? The fly then leaves lens
1 and sits in front of lens 2, which also forms an image at d ! 20 cm
that has the same orientation as the fly, but now HI ! 0.50H. What
are (c) f2 and (d) p2?
108
You grind the lenses shown in
Fig. 34-53 from flat glass disks (n !
1.5) using a machine that can grind a
radius of curvature of either 40 cm or
60 cm. In a lens where either radius is
appropriate, you select the 40 cm ra-
dius. Then you hold each lens in sun-
shine to form an image of the Sun.
What are the (a) focal length f and
(b) image type (real or virtual) for
(bi-convex) lens 1, (c) f and (d) image
type for (plane-convex) lens 2, (e) f
and (f) image type for (meniscus con-
vex) lens 3, (g) f and (h) image type
for (bi-concave) lens 4, (i) f and (j) image type for (plane-concave)
lens 5, and (k) f and (l) image type for (meniscus concave) lens 6?

In Fig. 34-54, a fish watcher at
point P watches a fish through a
glass wall of a fish tank.The watcher
is level with the fish; the index of re-
fraction of the glass is 8/5, and that
of the water is 4/3. The distances are
d1 ! 8.0 cm, d2 ! 3.0 cm, and d3 !
6.8 cm. (a) To the fish, how far away
does the watcher appear to be?
(Hint: The watcher is the object.
Light 
from 
that 
object 
passes
through the wall’s outside surface, which acts as a refracting sur-
face. Find the image produced by that surface. Then treat that im-
age as an object whose light passes through the wall’s inside sur-
face, which acts as another refracting surface.) (b) To the watcher,
how far away does the fish appear to be?

In Fig. 34-52, an object is placed in front of a converging lens
at a distance equal to twice the focal length f1 of the lens. On the
other side of the lens is a concave mirror of focal length f2 sepa-
rated from the lens by a distance 2(f1 ' f2). Light from the object
passes rightward through the lens, reflects from the mirror, passes
leftward through the lens, and forms a final image of the object.
What are (a) the distance between the lens and that final image
and (b) the overall lateral magnification M of the object? Is the im-
age (c) real or virtual (if it is virtual, it requires someone looking
through the lens toward the mirror), (d) to the left or right of the
lens, and (e) inverted or noninverted relative to the object?

A goldfish in a spherical fish bowl of radius R is at the
level of the center C of the bowl and at distance R/2 from the glass
(Fig. 34-55).What magnification of the fish is produced by the wa-
ter in the bowl for a viewer looking along a line that includes the
fish and the center, with the fish on the near side of the center?
The index of refraction of the water is 1.33. Neglect the glass wall
of the bowl. Assume the viewer looks with one eye. (Hint:
Equation 34-5 holds, but Eq. 34-6 does not.You need to work with
a ray diagram of the situation and assume that the rays are close
to the observer’s line of sight—that is, they deviate from that line
by only small angles.)
