THE  RELATIVITY  OF  DISTANCE       29 
particular  time  t — judged  from  the  embankment. 
These  points  A  and  B  of  the  embankment  can  be  deter 
mined  by  applying  the  definition  of  time  given  in 
Section  VIII.  The  distance  between  these  points  A 
and  B  is  then  measured  by  repeated  application  of  the 
measuring-rod  along  the  embankment. 
A  priori  it  is  by  no  means  certain  that  this  last 
measurement  will  supply  us  with  the  same  result  as 
the  first.  Thus  the  length  of  the  train  as  measured 
from  the  embankment  may  be  different  from  that 
obtained  by  measuring  in  the  train  itself.  This 
circumstance  leads  us  to  a  second  objection  which  must 
be  raised  against  the  apparently  obvious  considera 
tion  of  Section  VI.  Namely,  if  the  man  in  the  carriage 
covers  the  distance  w  in  a  unit  of  time — measured  from 
the  train, — then  this  distance — as  measured  from  the 
embankment — is  not  necessarily  also  equal  to  w.
