PROJECTILE MOTION
As is illustrated in Fig. 4-9 and Eq. 4-23, the vertical velocity component be-
haves just as for a ball thrown vertically upward. It is directed upward initially,
and its magnitude steadily decreases to zero, which marks the maximum height of
the path. The vertical velocity component then reverses direction, and its magni-
tude becomes larger with time.
The Equation of the Path
We can find the equation of the projectile’s path (its trajectory) by eliminating
time t between Eqs. 4-21 and 4-22. Solving Eq. 4-21 for t and substituting into
Eq. 4-22, we obtain, after a little rearrangement,
(trajectory).
(4-25)
This is the equation of the path shown in Fig. 4-9. In deriving it, for simplicity we
let x0 " 0 and y0 " 0 in Eqs. 4-21 and 4-22, respectively. Because g, u0, and v0 are
constants, Eq. 4-25 is of the form y " ax # bx2, in which a and b are constants.
This is the equation of a parabola, so the path is parabolic.
The Horizontal Range
The horizontal range R of the projectile is the horizontal distance the projectile
has traveled when it returns to its initial height (the height at which it is
launched). To find range R, let us put x $ x0 " R in Eq. 4-21 and y $ y0 " 0 in 
Eq. 4-22, obtaining
R " (v0 cos u0)t
and
Eliminating t between these two equations yields
Using the identity sin 2u0 " 2 sin u0 cos u0 (see Appendix E), we obtain
(4-26)
This equation does not give the horizontal distance traveled by a projectile when
the final height is not the launch height. Note that R in Eq. 4-26 has its maximum
value when sin 2u0 " 1, which corresponds to 2u0 " 90° or u0 " 45°.

Figure 4-12 The vertical component of this
skateboarder’s velocity is changing but not
the horizontal component, which matches
the skateboard’s velocity. As a result, the
skateboard stays underneath him, allowing
him to land on it.

The horizontal range R is maximum for a launch angle of 45°.
However, when the launch and landing heights differ, as in many sports, a launch
angle of 45° does not yield the maximum horizontal distance.
The Effects of the Air
We have assumed that the air through which the projectile moves has no effect
on its motion. However, in many situations, the disagreement between our calcu-
lations and the actual motion of the projectile can be large because the air resists
(opposes) the motion. Figure 4-13, for example, shows two paths for a fly ball that
leaves the bat at an angle of 60° with the horizontal and an initial speed of 
44.7 m/s. Path I (the baseball player’s fly ball) is a calculated path that
approximates normal conditions of play, in air. Path II (the physics professor’s fly
ball) is the path the ball would follow in a vacuum.
