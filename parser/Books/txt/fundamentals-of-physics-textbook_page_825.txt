Switch S in Fig. 27-63 is closed at
time t ! 0, to begin charging an initially
uncharged capacitor of capacitance C !
15.0 mF through a resistor of resistance 
R ! 20.0 0. At what time is the potential
across the capacitor equal to that across
the resistor?
•58
In an RC series circuit, emf # ! 12.0 V, resistance R !
1.40 M0, and capacitance C ! 1.80 mF. (a) Calculate the time con-
stant. (b) Find the maximum charge that will appear on the capaci-
tor during charging. (c) How long does it take for the charge to
build up to 16.0 mC?
•59
What multiple of the time constant t gives the time
taken by an initially uncharged capacitor in an RC series circuit to
be charged to 99.0% of its final charge?
•60
A capacitor with initial charge q0 is discharged through a
resistor. What multiple of the time constant t gives the time the
capacitor takes to lose (a) the first one-third of its charge and
(b) two-thirds of its charge?
•61
A 15.0 k0 resistor and a capacitor are connected in se-
ries, and then a 12.0 V potential difference is suddenly applied
across them. The potential difference across the capacitor rises to
5.00 V in 1.30 ms. (a) Calculate the time constant of the circuit.
(b) Find the capacitance of the capacitor.
••62
Figure 27-64 shows the circuit of
a flashing lamp, like those attached to
barrels at highway construction sites.
The fluorescent lamp L (of negligible
capacitance) is connected in parallel
across the capacitor C of an RC circuit.
There is a current through the lamp
only when the potential difference
across it reaches the breakdown volt-
age VL; then the capacitor discharges completely through the lamp
and the lamp flashes briefly. For a lamp with breakdown voltage 
VL ! 72.0 V, wired to a 95.0 V ideal battery and a 0.150 mF capacitor,
what resistance R is needed for two flashes per second?

reads from 0 to 1.00 mA, as shown in
Fig. 27-59. Resistance R is adjusted
so that when the clip leads are
shorted together, the meter deflects
to its full-scale value of 1.00 mA.
What external resistance across the
leads results in a deflection of (a)
10.0%, (b) 50.0%, and (c) 90.0% of full scale? (d) If the ammeter
has a resistance of 20.0 0 and the internal resistance of the battery
is negligible, what is the value of R?
••53
In Fig. 27-14, assume that # ! 3.0 V, r ! 100 0, R1 ! 250 0,
and R2 ! 300 0. If the voltmeter resistance RV is 5.0 k0, what per-
cent error does it introduce into the measurement of the potential
difference across R1? Ignore the presence of the ammeter.
••54
When the lights of a car are
switched on, an ammeter in series with
them reads 10.0 A and a voltmeter
connected across them reads 12.0 V (Fig.
27-60). When the electric starting motor is
turned on, the ammeter reading drops to
8.00 A and the lights dim somewhat. If the
internal resistance of the battery is 0.0500
0 and that of the ammeter is negligible,
what are (a) the emf of the battery and (b)
the current through the starting motor
when the lights are on?
••55
In Fig. 27-61, Rs is to be adjusted in
value by moving the sliding contact across
it until points a and b are brought to the
same potential. (One tests for this condition by momentarily con-
necting a sensitive ammeter be-
tween a and b; if these points are at
the same potential, the ammeter
will not deflect.) Show that when
this adjustment is made, the follow-
ing relation holds: Rx ! RsR2/R1.
An unknown resistance (Rx) can be
measured in terms of a standard
(Rs) using this device, which is
called a Wheatstone bridge.
••56
In Fig. 27-62, a voltmeter of
resistance RV ! 300 0 and an am-
meter of resistance RA ! 3.00 0
are being used to measure a resist-
ance R in a circuit that also con-
tains a resistance R0 ! 100 0 and
an ideal battery of emf # ! 12.0 V.
Resistance R is given by R ! V/i,
where V is the voltmeter reading
and i is the current in resistance R.
However, the ammeter reading is
not i but rather i-, which is i plus the
current through the voltmeter.
Thus, the ratio of the two meter
readings is not R but only an appar-
