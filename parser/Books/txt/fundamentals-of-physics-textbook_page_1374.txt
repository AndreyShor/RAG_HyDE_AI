Similarly, the eightfold way patterns strongly suggest that the mesons and the
baryons must have an underlying structure, in terms of which their properties
can be understood. That structure can be explained in terms of the quark
model, which we now discuss.

energies and kinetic energies of the pions. To answer, we
evaluate the Q of the decay:
The fact that Q is positive indicates that the initial mass
energy exceeds the final mass energy.Thus, the proton does
have enough mass energy to create the pair of pions.
Spin: Is spin angular momentum conserved by the decay?
This amounts to determining whether the net component Sz
of spin angular momentum along some arbitrary z axis can
be conserved by the decay. The spin quantum numbers s of
the particles in the process are 
for the proton and 0 for
both pions. Thus, for the proton the component Sz can be 
either 
or 
and for each pion it is 
. We see that
there is no way that Sz can be conserved. Hence, spin angular
momentum is not conserved, and the proposed decay of the
proton cannot occur.
Baryon number: The decay also violates the conservation of
baryon number:The proton has a baryon number of B ! '1,
and both pions have a baryon number of B ! 0.Thus,noncon-
servation of baryon number is another reason the proposed
decay cannot occur.

Proton decay: conservation of quantum numbers, energy, and momentum
Determine whether a stationary proton can decay according
to the scheme
Properties of the proton and the p' pion are listed in
Table 44-1. The p0 pion has zero charge, zero spin, and a
mass energy of 135.0 MeV.
KEY IDEA
We need to see whether the proposed decay violates any of
the conservation laws we have discussed.
Electric charge: We see that the net charge quantum
number is initially '1 and finally 0 ' 1, or '1. Thus, charge
is conserved by the decay. Lepton number is also conserved,
because none of the three particles is a lepton and thus each
lepton number is zero.
Linear momentum: Because the proton is stationary, with
zero linear momentum, the two pions must merely move in
opposite directions with equal magnitudes of linear
momentum (so that their total linear momentum is also
zero) to conserve linear momentum.The fact that linear mo-
mentum can be conserved means that the process does not
violate the conservation of linear momentum.
Energy: Is there energy for the decay? Because the proton
is stationary, that question amounts to asking whether the
proton’s mass energy is sufficient to produce the mass 
p : p 0 ' p'.
hadron. (2) To answer the second question we need to
determine the baryon number of the @# particle. If it is
'1 or #1, then the @# is a baryon. If, instead, it is 0, then
the @# is a meson.
Baryon number: To see, let us write the overall decay
scheme, from the initial @# to the final relatively stable
products, as
(44-17)
On the right side, the proton has a baryon number of '1
and each electron and neutrino has a baryon number of 0.
Thus, the net baryon number of the right side is '1. That
must then be the baryon number of the lone @# particle on
the left side.We conclude that the @# particle is a baryon.
(b) Does the decay process conserve the three lepton numbers?
@# : p ' 2(e# ' n¯e) ' 2(vm ' ¯nm).
Sample Problem 44.04
Xi-minus decay: conservation of quantum numbers 
A particle called xi-minus and having the symbol @# decays
as follows:
The ?0 particle (called lambda-zero) and the p# particle are
both unstable. The following decay processes occur in 
cascade until only relatively stable products remain:
(a) Is the @# particle a lepton or a hadron? If the latter, is it
a baryon or a meson?
KEY IDEAS
(1) Only three families of leptons exist (Table 44-2) and
none include the @# particle. Thus, the @# must be a
m# : e# ' nm ' ¯ne.
?0 : p ' p#
p# : m# ' ¯nm
@# : ?0 ' p#.
