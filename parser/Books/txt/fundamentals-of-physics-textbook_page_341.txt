11-8 CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM
Checkpoint 7
A rhinoceros beetle rides the rim of a small disk that rotates like a merry-go-round.
If the beetle crawls toward the center of the disk, do the following (each relative to
the central axis) increase, decrease, or remain the same for the beetle–disk system:
(a) rotational inertia, (b) angular momentum, and (c) angular speed?
to the audience. As the performer ascends, the outstretched leg is brought
down and the other leg is brought up, with both ending up at angle u to the
body (Fig. 11-19b). The motion is graceful, but it also serves to increase the
rotation because bringing in the initially outstretched leg decreases the per-
former’s rotational inertia. Since no external torque acts on the airborne
performer, the angular momentum cannot change. Thus, with a decrease in
rotational inertia, the angular speed must increase. When the jump is well
executed, the performer seems to suddenly begin to spin and rotates 180(
before the initial leg orientations are reversed in preparation for the landing.
Once a leg is again outstretched, the rotation seems to vanish.
Sample Problem 11.05
Conservation of angular momentum, rotating wheel demo
Figure 11-20a shows a student, again sitting on a stool that
can rotate freely about a vertical axis. The student, initially
at rest, is holding a bicycle wheel whose rim is loaded with
lead and whose rotational inertia Iwh about its central axis is
1.2 kg"m2. (The rim contains lead in order to make the value
of Iwh substantial.)
The wheel is rotating at an angular speed vwh of 3.9
rev/s; as seen from overhead, the rotation is counterclock-
wise. The axis of the wheel is vertical, and the angular
momentum 
of the wheel points vertically upward.
The student now inverts the wheel (Fig. 11-20b) so that,
as seen from overhead, it is rotating clockwise. Its angular
momentum is now 
. The inversion results in the stu-
dent, the stool, and the wheel’s center rotating together as a
composite rigid body about the stool’s rotation axis, with ro-
tational inertia Ib ! 6.8 kg"m2. (The fact that the wheel is
also rotating about its center does not affect the mass distri-
bution of this composite body; thus, Ib has the same value
whether or not the wheel rotates.) With what angular speed
vb and in what direction does the composite body rotate af-
ter the inversion of the wheel?
KEY IDEAS
1. The angular speed vb we seek is related to the final angu-
lar momentum 
of the composite body about the
stool’s rotation axis by Eq. 11-31 (L
Iv).
2. The initial angular speed vwh of the wheel is related to the
angular momentum 
of the wheel’s rotation about its
center by the same equation.
3. The vector addition of 
and 
gives the total angular
momentum 
of the system of the student, stool, and
wheel.
4. As the wheel is inverted, no net external torque acts on

about any vertical axis.
(Torques due to forces between the student and the
wheel as the student inverts the wheel are internal to the
system.) So, the system’s total angular momentum is con-
served about any vertical axis, including the rotation axis
through the stool.
