When a shower is turned on in a closed bathroom, the
splashing of the water on the bare tub can fill the room’s air with
negatively charged ions and produce an electric field in the air as
great as 1000 N/C. Consider a bathroom with dimensions 2.5 m (
3.0 m ( 2.0 m. Along the ceiling, floor, and four walls, approximate
the electric field in the air as being directed perpendicular to the sur-
face and as having a uniform magnitude of 600 N/C.Also,treat those
surfaces as forming a closed Gaussian surface around the room’s air.
What are (a) the volume charge density r and (b) the number of
excess elementary charges e per cubic meter in the room’s air?

The square surface shown
in Fig. 23-30 measures 3.2 mm on
each side. It is immersed in a uni-
form electric field with magnitude
E $ 1800 N/C and with field lines at
an angle of u $ 35° with a normal to
the surface, as shown. Take that
normal to be directed “outward,” as
though the surface were one face of
a box. Calculate the electric flux
through the surface.
