with  the  measuring-rod)  instead  of  designated  points  of 
reference. 
(c)  We  speak  of  the  height  of  the  cloud  even  when  the 
pole  which  reaches  the  cloud  has  not  been  erected. 
By  means  of  optical  observations  of  the  cloud  from 
different  positions  on  the  ground,  and  taking  into  account 
the  properties  of  the  propagation  of  light,  we  determine 
the  length  of  the  pole  we  should  have  required  in  order 
to  reach  the  cloud. 
From  this  consideration  we  see  that  it  will  be  ad 
vantageous  if,  in  the  description  of  position,  it  should  be 
possible  by  means  of  numerical  measures  to  make  our 
selves  independent  of  the  existence  of  marked  positions 
(possessing  names)  on  the  rigid  body  of  reference.  In 
the  physics  of  measurement  this  is  attained  by  the 
application  of  the  Cartesian  system  of  co-ordinates. 
This  consists  of  three  plane  surfaces  perpendicular 
to  each  other  and  rigidly  attached  to  a  rigid  body. 
Referred  to  a  system  of  co-ordinates,  the  scene  of  any 
event  will  be  determined  (for  the  main  part)  by  the 
specification  of  the  lengths  of  the  three  perpendiculars 
or  co-ordinates  (x,  y,  z)  which  can  be  dropped  from  the 
scene  of  the  event  to  those  three  plane  surfaces.  The 
lengths  of  these  three  perpendiculars  can  be  deter 
mined  by  a  series  of  manipulations  with  rigid  measuring- 
rods  performed  according  to  the  rules  and  methods  laid 
down  by  Euclidean  geometry. 
In  practice,  the  rigid  surfaces  which  constitute  the 
system  of  co-ordinates  are  generally  not  available  ; 
furthermore,  the  magnitudes  of  the  co-ordinates  are  not 
actually  determined  by  constructions  with  rigid  rods,  but 
by  indirect  means.  If  the  results  of  physics  and  astron 
omy  are  to  maintain  their  clearness,  the  physical  mean-
