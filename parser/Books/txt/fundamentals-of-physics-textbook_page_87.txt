A fire ant, searching for hot sauce in a picnic area, goes
through three displacements along level ground:
l for 0.40 m
southwest (that is, at 45° from directly south and from directly
west),
2 for 0.50 m due east,
3 for 0.60 m at 60° north of east.
Let the positive x direction be east and the positive y direction
be north. What are (a) the x component and (b) the y compo-
nent of 
l? Next, what are (c) the x component and (d) the y
component of 
2? Also, what are (e) the x component and (f)
the y component of 
3?
What are (g) the x component, (h) the y component, (i) the
magnitude, and (j) the direction of the ant’s net displacement? If
the ant is to return directly to the starting point, (k) how far and (1)
in what direction should it move?

A bank in downtown Boston is robbed (see the map in 
Fig. 3-36). To elude police, the robbers escape by helicopter, mak-
ing three successive flights described by the following displace-
ments: 32 km, 45° south of east; 53 km, 26° north of west; 26 km, 18°
east of south. At the end of the third flight they are captured. In
what town are they apprehended?

A wheel with a radius of 45.0 cm
rolls without slipping along a hori-
zontal floor (Fig. 3-37). At time t1,
the dot P painted on the rim of the
wheel is at the point of contact be-
tween the wheel and the floor. At a
later time t2, the wheel has rolled
through one-half of a revolution.
What are (a) the magnitude and (b)
the angle (relative to the floor) of
the displacement of P?

175 m directly east. Find (a) the magnitude and (b) the angle of her
final displacement from the starting point. (c) Find the distance she
walks. (d) Which is greater, that distance or the magnitude of her
displacement?

A man goes for a walk, starting from the origin of an xyz
coordinate system, with the xy plane horizontal and the x axis east-
ward. Carrying a bad penny, he walks 1300 m east, 2200 m north,
and then drops the penny from a cliff 410 m high. (a) In unit-vector
notation, what is the displacement of the penny from start to its
landing point? (b) When the man returns to the origin, what is the
magnitude of his displacement for the return trip?
