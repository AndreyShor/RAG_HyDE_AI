MORE ABOUT MATTER WAVES
From the first of these equations, we find the new limits of
integration to be y1 ! 0 for x1 ! 0 and y2 ! p/3 for x2 ! L/3.
We then must evaluate
Using integral 11 in Appendix E, we then find
Thus, we have
(Answer)
That is,if we repeatedly probe the left one-third of the well,then
on average we can detect the electron with 20% of the probes.
(b) What is the probability that the electron can be detected
in the middle one-third of the well?
Reasoning: We now know that the probability of detection
in the left one-third of the well is 0.20. By symmetry, the
probability of detection in the right one-third of the well is
also 0.20. Because the electron is certainly in the well, the
probability of detection in the entire well is 1.Thus, the prob-
ability of detection in the middle one-third of the well is

Sample Problem 39.02
Detection probability in a 1D infinite potential well
A ground-state electron is trapped in the one-dimensional
infinite potential well of Fig. 39-2, with width L ! 100 pm.
(a) What is the probability that the electron can be detected
in the left one-third of the well (x1 ! 0 to x2 ! L/3)?
KEY IDEAS
(1) If we probe the left one-third of the well,there is no guaran-
tee that we will detect the electron. However, we can calculate
the probability of detecting it with the integral of Eq. 39-13.
(2) The probability very much depends on which state the elec-
tron is in—that is,the value of quantum number n.
Calculations: Because here the electron is in the ground
state, we set n ! 1 in Eq. 39-13.We also set the limits of inte-
gration as the positions x1 ! 0 and x2 ! L/3 and set the
amplitude constant A as 
(so that the wave function is
normalized).We then see that
We could find this probability by substituting 100 " 10#12 m
for L and then using a graphing calculator or a computer
math package to evaluate the integral. Here, however, we
shall evaluate the integral “by hand.” First we switch to a
new integration variable y:

We can make the zero-point energy as small as we like by making the infinite
well wider—that is, by increasing L in Eq. 39-4 for n ! 1. In the limit as L

0. However, the electron is then a free particle, no
longer confined in the x direction. Also, because the energy of a free particle is
not quantized, that energy can have any value, including zero. Only a confined
particle must have a finite zero-point energy and can never be at rest.

Checkpoint 3
Each of the following particles is confined to an infinite well, and all four wells have the
same width: (a) an electron, (b) a proton, (c) a deuteron, and (d) an alpha particle. Rank
their zero-point energies, greatest first.The particles are listed in order of increasing mass.
Calculations: Substituting Eq. 39-10 into Eq. 39-14 and tak-
ing the constant A outside the integral yield

We have changed the limits of the integral from #, and ',
to 0 and L because the “outside” wave function is zero.

Sample Problem 39.03
Normalizing wave functions in a 1D infinite potential well
Evaluate the amplitude constant A in Eq.39-10 for an infinite
potential well extending from x ! 0 to x ! L.
KEY IDEA
The wave functions of Eq. 39-10 must satisfy the normalization
requirement of Eq. 39-14, which states that the probability that
the electron can be detected somewhere along the x axis is 1.
