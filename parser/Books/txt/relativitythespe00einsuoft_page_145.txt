EXPERIMENTAL  CONFIRMATION     127 
according  to  the  general  theory  of  relativity,  a  ray  of 
light  will  experience  a  curvature  of  its  path  when  passing 
through  a  gravitational  field,  this  curvature  being  similar 
to  that  experienced  by  the  path  of  a  body  which  is 
projected  through  a  gravitational  field.  As  a  result  of 
this  theory,  we  should  expect  that  a  ray  of  light  which 
is  passing  close  to  a  heavenly  body  would  be  deviated 
towards  the  latter.  For  a  ray  of  light  which  passes  the 
sun  at  a  distance  of  A  sun-radii  from  its  centre,  the 
angle  of  deflection  (a)  should  amount  to 
i -7  seconds  of  arc 
_____ 
It  may  be  added  that,  according  to  the  theory,  half  of 
this  deflection  is   produced   by  the 
Newtonian  field  of  attraction  of  the  i 
sun,  and  the  other  half  by  the  geo-  ^D( 
metrical  modification  ("curvature")  ' 
of  space  caused  by  the  sun.  ,    ' 
This  result  admits   of    an  experi-  /  / 
mental  test  by  means  of  the  photo 
graphic    registration  of  stars  during 
a  total  eclipse  of  the  sun.    The  only        D  jj 
reason  why  we  must  wait  for  a  total          '//     2 
eclipse    is    because   at    every   other        / 
time  the  atmosphere   is   so  strongly     t 
illuminated   by    the  light   from   the  FIG.  5. 
sun  that  the  stars  situated  near  the 
sun's  disc  are  invisible.  The  predicted  effect  can  be 
seen  clearly  from  the  accompanying  diagram.  If  the 
sun  (S)  were  not  present,  a  star  which  is  practically 
infinitely  distant  would  be  seen  in  the  direction  Dv  as 
observed  from  the  earth.  But  as  a  consequence  of  the
