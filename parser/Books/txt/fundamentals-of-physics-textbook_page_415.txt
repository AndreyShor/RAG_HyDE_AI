Three forces act on this sample of water.
This upward force is due to the water 
pressure pushing on the bottom surface.
Gravity pulls downward on the sample.

●Pressure in a fluid at rest varies with vertical position y. For
y measured positive upward,
p2 ! p1 # rg(y1 % y2).
If h is the depth of a fluid sample below some reference level
at which the pressure is p0, this equation becomes
p ! p0 # rgh,
where p is the pressure in the sample.
●The pressure in a fluid is the same for all points at the same
level.
●Gauge pressure is the difference between the actual pres-
sure (or absolute pressure) at a point and the atmospheric
pressure.
Key Ideas
Fluids at Rest
Figure 14-2a shows a tank of water—or other liquid—open to the atmosphere.
As every diver knows, the pressure increases with depth below the air–water
interface. The diver’s depth gauge, in fact, is a pressure sensor much like that of
Fig. 14-1b. As every mountaineer knows, the pressure decreases with altitude as
one ascends into the atmosphere.The pressures encountered by the diver and the
mountaineer are usually called hydrostatic pressures, because they are due to flu-
ids that are static (at rest). Here we want to find an expression for hydrostatic
pressure as a function of depth or altitude.
Let us look first at the increase in pressure with depth below the water’s
surface. We set up a vertical y axis in the tank, with its origin at the air–water
interface and the positive direction upward.We next consider a water sample con-
