THE  LORENTZ  TRANSFORMATION    119

It  is  required  by  the  law  of  propagation  of  light,  in 
conjunction  with  the  postulate  of  relativity,  that  the 
transmission  of  the  signal  in  question  should  take  place 
—as  judged  from  K'— in  accordance  with  the  corre 
sponding  formula 
r'=cif, 
or, 
In  order  that  equation  (TOO)  may  be  a  consequence  of 
equation  (10),  we  must  have 
(ii). 
Since  equation  (8a)  must  hold  for  points  on  the 
#-axis,  we  thus  have  o-=i.  It  is  easily  seen  that  the 
Lorentz  transformation  really  satisfies  equation  (11) 
for  cr=i  ;  for  (11)  is  a  consequence  of  (8a)  and  (9), 
and  hence  also  of  (8)  and  (9).  We  have  thus  derived 
the  Lorentz  transformation. 
The  Lorentz  transformation  represented  by  (8)  and 
(9)  still  requires  to  be  generalised.  Obviously  it  is 
immaterial  whether  the  axes  of  K'  be  chosen  so  that 
they  are  spatially  parallel  to  those  of  K.  It  is  also  not 
essential  that  the  velocity  of  translation  of  K'  with 
respect  to  K  should  be  in  the  direction  of  the  #-axis. 
A  simple  consideration  shows  that  we  are  able  to 
construct  the  Lorentz  transformation  in  this  general 
sense  from  two  kinds  of  transformations,  viz.  from 
Lorentz  transformations  in  the  special  sense  and  from 
purely  spatial  transformations,  which  corresponds  to 
the  replacement  of  the  rectangular  co-ordinate  system
