After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
28.38 Identify that a current-carrying coil is a magnetic dipole
with a magnetic dipole moment 
that has the direction of
the normal vector , as given by a right-hand rule.
28.39 For a current-carrying coil, apply the relationship
between the magnitude m of the magnetic dipole moment,
the number of turns N, the area A of each turn, and the
current i.
28.40 On a sketch of a current-carrying coil, draw the direction
of the current, and then use a right-hand rule to determine the
direction of the magnetic dipole moment vector .
28.41 For a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field, ap-
ply the relationship between the torque magnitude t, the
dipole moment magnitude m, the magnetic field magnitude
B, and the angle u between the dipole moment vector 
and the magnetic field vector .
28.42 Identify the convention of assigning a plus or minus
sign to a torque according to the direction of rotation.
28.43 Calculate the torque on a magnetic dipole by evaluat-
ing a cross product of the dipole moment vector

external magnetic field vector , in magnitude-angle nota-
tion and unit-vector notation.
28.44 For a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field,
identify the dipole orientations at which the torque magni-
tude is minimum and maximum.
28.45 For a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field,
apply the relationship between the orientation energy U,
the dipole moment magnitude m, the external magnetic
field magnitude B, and the angle u between the dipole
moment vector 
and the magnetic field vector .
28.46 Calculate the orientation energy U by taking a dot prod-
uct of the dipole moment vector 
and the external magnetic
field vector , in magnitude-angle and unit-vector notations.
28.47 Identify the orientations of a magnetic dipole in an ex-
ternal magnetic field that give the minimum and maximum
orientation energies.
28.48 For a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field, relate the ori-
entation energy U to the work Wa done by an external
torque as the dipole rotates in the magnetic field.

approximated as all having the same dimensions and lying in a plane. Then the
turns form a flat coil, and a torque t( with the magnitude given in Eq. 28-32 acts
on each of them.The total torque on the coil then has magnitude
t ! Nt( ! NiabB sin u ! (NiA)B sin u,
(28-33)
in which A (
ab) is the area enclosed by the coil. The quantities in parentheses
(NiA) are grouped together because they are all properties of the coil: its number
of turns, its area, and the current it carries. Equation 28-33 holds for all flat coils,
no matter what their shape, provided the magnetic field is uniform. For example,
for the common circular coil, with radius r, we have
t !(Nipr2)B sin u.

Normal Vector. Instead of focusing on the motion of the coil, it is simpler to
keep track of the vector , which is normal to the plane of the coil. Equation 28-33
tells us that a current-carrying flat coil placed in a magnetic field will tend to
rotate so that 
has the same direction as the field. In a motor, the current in
the coil is reversed as 
begins to line up with the field direction, so that a torque
continues to rotate the coil. This automatic reversal of the current is done via
a commutator that electrically connects the rotating coil with the stationary con-
tacts on the wires that supply the current from some source.
