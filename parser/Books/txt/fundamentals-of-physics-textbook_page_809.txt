27-2 MULTILOOP CIRCUITS
Resistances connected in parallel can be replaced with an equivalent resistance
Req that has the same potential difference V and the same total current i as the
actual resistances.
You might remember that Req and all the actual parallel resistances have the
same potential difference V with the nonsense word “par-V.”
To derive an expression for Req in Fig. 27-10b, we first write the current in
each actual resistance in Fig. 27-10a as
where V is the potential difference between a and b. If we apply the junction rule
at point a in Fig. 27-10a and then substitute these values, we find
(27-21)
If we replaced the parallel combination with the equivalent resistance Req
(Fig. 27-10b), we would have
(27-22)
Comparing Eqs. 27-21 and 27-22 leads to
(27-23)
Extending this result to the case of n resistances, we have
(n resistances in parallel).
(27-24)
For the case of two resistances, the equivalent resistance is their product divided
by their sum; that is,
(27-25)
Note that when two or more resistances are connected in parallel,the equivalent
resistance is smaller than any of the combining resistances.Table 27-1 summarizes the
equivalence relations for resistors and capacitors in series and in parallel.

Checkpoint 4
A battery, with potential V across it, is connected to a combination of two identical re-
sistors and then has current i through it.What are the potential difference across and
the current through either resistor if the resistors are (a) in series and (b) in parallel?
