BIOGRAPHICAL    NOTE 
ALBERT  EINSTEIN   is  the    son    of   German- 
Jewish  parents.    He  was  born  in  1879  m  tne 
town    of    Ulm,    Wurtemberg,     Germany.     His 
schooldays  were  spent  in  Munich,  where  he  attended 
the  Gymnasium  until  his  sixteenth  year.     After  leaving 
school  at  Munich,  he  accompanied  his  parents  to  Milan, 
whence  he  proceeded  to  Switzerland  six  months  later 
to  continue  his  studies. 
From  1856  to  1900  Albert  Einstein  studied  mathe 
matics  and  physics  at  the  Technical  High  School  in 
Zurich,  as  he  intended  becoming  a  secondary  school 
(Gymnasium)  teacher.  For  some  time  afterwards  he 
was  a  private  tutor,  and  having  meanwhile  become 
naturalised,  he  obtained  a  post  as  engineer  in  the  Swiss 
Patent  Office  in  190^  which  position  he  occupied  till 
1Z--7 
1900.  The  main  ideas  involved  in  the  most  important 
of  Einstein's  theories  date  back  to  this  period.  Amongst 
these  may  be  mentioned  :  The  Special  Theory  of  Rela 
tivity,  Inertia  of  Energy,  Theory  of  the  Brownian  Move 
ment,  and  the  Quantum-Law  of  the  Emission  and  Ab 
sorption  of  Light  (1905) .  These  were  followed  some  years
