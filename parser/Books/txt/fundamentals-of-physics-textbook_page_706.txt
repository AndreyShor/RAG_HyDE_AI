The electric field in a certain region of Earth’s atmo-
sphere is directed vertically down.At an altitude of 300 m the field
has magnitude 60.0 N/C; at an altitude of 200 m, the magnitude is
100 N/C. Find the net amount of charge contained in a cube 100 m
on edge, with horizontal faces at altitudes of 200 and 300 m.

Flux and nonconducting shells. A charged particle is sus-
pended at the center of two concentric spherical shells that are
very thin and made of nonconducting material. Figure 23-37a
shows a cross section. Figure 23-37b gives the net flux & through a
Gaussian sphere centered on the particle, as a function of the ra-
dius r of the sphere. The scale of the vertical axis is set by &s $
5.0 ( 105 N?m2/C. (a) What is the charge of the central particle?
What are the net charges of (b) shell A and (c) shell B?

A particle of charge "q is placed at one corner of a Gaussian
cube.What multiple of q/´0 gives the flux through (a) each cube face
forming that corner and (b) each of the other cube faces?

The box-like Gaussian surface shown in Fig. 23-38 en-
closes a net charge of 
24.0´0 C and lies in an electric field given

ters and b a constant.The bottom face is in the xz plane; the top face
is in the horizontal plane passing through y2 $ 1.00 m. For x1 $

Flux and conducting shells. A charged particle is held at the
center of two concentric conducting spherical shells. Figure 23-39a
shows a cross section. Figure 23-39b gives the net flux & through a
Gaussian sphere centered on the particle, as a function of the radius r
of the sphere. The scale of the vertical axis is set by &s $ 5.0 (
105 N?m2/C. What are (a) the charge of the central particle and the
net charges of (b) shell A and (c) shell B?

ity with a particle of charge q $ "3.0 ( 10'6 C.What is the charge on
(a) the cavity wall and (b) the outer surface?

An electron is released 9.0 cm from a very long nonconduct-
ing rod with a uniform 6.0 mC/m. What is the magnitude of the
electron’s initial acceleration?

and a diameter of 12 cm.The electric field just above the drum’s sur-
face is 2.3 ( 105 N/C.What is the total charge on the drum? (b) The
manufacturer wishes to produce a desktop version of the machine.
This requires reducing the drum length to 28 cm and the diameter to
8.0 cm.The electric field at the drum surface must not change.What
must be the charge on this new drum?

A uniformly charged conducting sphere of 1.2 m diam-
eter has surface charge density 8.1 mC/m2. Find (a) the net charge
on the sphere and (b) the total electric flux leaving the surface.

The electric field just above the surface of the charged con-
ducting drum of a photocopying machine has a magnitude E of
2.3 ( 10 5 N/C. What is the surface charge density on the drum?

Space vehicles traveling through Earth’s radiation belts can
intercept a significant number of electrons. The resulting charge
buildup can damage electronic components and disrupt operations.
Suppose a spherical metal satellite 1.3 m in diameter accumulates
2.4 mC of charge in one orbital revolution. (a) Find the resulting sur-
face charge density. (b) Calculate the magnitude of the electric field
just outside the surface of the satellite,due to the surface charge.
