Second, when there are more than two vectors, we can group them in any order
as we add them. Thus, if we want to add vectors ,
, and , we can add 
and 
first and then add their vector sum to . We can also add 
and 
first and then
add that sum to .We get the same result either way, as shown in Fig. 3-4.That is,
(associative law).

The vector 
is a vector with the same magnitude as 
but the opposite
direction (see Fig. 3-5).Adding the two vectors in Fig. 3-5 would yield
Thus, adding 
has the effect of subtracting . We use this property to define
the difference between two vectors: let 
. Then
(vector subtraction);
(3-4)
that is, we find the difference vector 
by adding the vector 
to the vector .
Figure 3-6 shows how this is done geometrically.
As in the usual algebra,we can move a term that includes a vector symbol from
one side of a vector equation to the other,but we must change its sign.For example,
if we are given Eq.3-4 and need to solve for ,we can rearrange the equation as
Remember that, although we have used displacement vectors here, the rules
for addition and subtraction hold for vectors of all kinds, whether they represent
velocities, accelerations, or any other vector quantity. However, we can add
only vectors of the same kind. For example, we can add two displacements, or two
velocities, but adding a displacement and a velocity makes no sense. In the arith-
metic of scalars, that would be like trying to add 21 s and 12 m.

Components of Vectors
Adding vectors geometrically can be tedious. A neater and easier technique
involves algebra but requires that the vectors be placed on a rectangular coordi-
nate system.The x and y axes are usually drawn in the plane of the page, as shown
same magnitude and opposite directions.
