CHAPTER 43
ENERGY FROM THE NUCLEUS
where )E is the energy produced when protons of mass )m
are consumed. From our discussion in this module, we know
that 26.2 MeV (! 4.20 " 10#12 J) of thermal energy is pro-
duced when four protons are consumed.That is, )E ! 4.20 "
10#12 J for a mass consumption of )m ! 4(1.67 " 10#27 kg).
Substituting these data into Eq. 43-12 and using the power P
of the Sun given in Appendix C, we find that
(Answer)
Thus, a huge amount of hydrogen is consumed by the Sun
every second. However, you need not worry too much
about the Sun running out of hydrogen,because its mass of 2 "
1030 kg will keep it burning for a long,long time.

Sample Problem 43.04
Consumption rate of hydrogen in the Sun
At what rate dm/dt is hydrogen being consumed in the core
of the Sun by the p-p cycle of Fig. 43-11?
KEY IDEA
The rate dE/dt at which energy is produced by hydrogen
(proton) consumption within the Sun is equal to the rate P at
which energy is radiated by the Sun:
Calculations: To bring the mass consumption rate dm/dt
into the power equation, we can rewrite it as

43-6 CONTROLLED THERMONUCLEAR FUSION
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
43.24 Give the three requirements for a thermonuclear reactor.
43.25 Define Lawson’s criterion.
43.26 Give general descriptions of the magnetic confinement
approach and the inertial confinement approach.
●Controlled thermonuclear fusion for energy generation has
not yet been achieved. The d-d and d-t reactions are the most
promising mechanisms.
●A successful fusion reactor must satisfy Lawson’s criterion, 
and must have a suitably high plasma temperature T.
●In a tokamak, the plasma is confined by a magnetic field.
●In laser fusion, inertial confinement is used.

Key Ideas
In such an event the outer shell of the star is blown outward into space, where it
mixes with the tenuous medium that fills the space between the stars. It is from this
medium, continually enriched by debris from stellar explosions, that new stars form,
by condensation under the influence of the gravitational force.
The abundance on Earth of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium
suggests that our solar system has condensed out of interstellar material that
contained the remnants of such explosions. Thus, all the elements around us—
including those in our own bodies—were manufactured in the interiors of stars that
no longer exist.As one scientist put it:“In truth,we are the children of the stars.”
Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion
The first thermonuclear reaction on Earth occurred at Eniwetok Atoll on
November 1, 1952, when the United States exploded a fusion device, generating
an energy release equivalent to 10 million tons of TNT. The high temperatures
and densities needed to initiate the reaction were provided by using a fission
bomb as a trigger.
