In Fig. 16-36a, string 1 has a
linear density of 3.00 g/m, and
string 2 has a linear density of 5.00
g/m. They are under tension due to
the hanging block of mass M # 500
g. Calculate the wave speed on (a)
string 1 and (b) string 2. (Hint:
When 
a 
string 
loops 
halfway
around a pulley, it pulls on the pul-
ley with a net force that is twice the
tension in the string.) Next the
block is divided into two blocks
(with M1 " M2 # M) and the appa-
ratus is rearranged as shown in
Fig. 16-36b. Find (c) M1 and (d) M2
such that the wave speeds in the
two strings are equal.

Energy and Power of a Wave Traveling 
Along a String

A string along which waves can travel is 2.70 m long and has
a mass of 260 g. The tension in the string is 36.0 N. What must be

A sinusoidal wave is sent along a string with a linear 
density of 2.0 g/m. As it travels,
the kinetic energies of 
the mass elements along the string vary. Figure 16-37a gives the
rate dK/dt at which kinetic energy passes through the string ele-
ments at a particular instant, plotted as a function of distance x
along the string. Figure 16-37b is similar except that it gives the
rate at which kinetic energy passes through a particular mass ele-
ment (at a particular location), plotted as a function of time t. For
both figures, the scale on the vertical (rate) axis is set by Rs # 10 W.
