PROBLEMS
the ball between hands during the flight, but it might also be sup-
ported by the longer horizontal distance the player travels in the
upper part of the jump than in the lower part. If a player jumps
with an initial speed of v0 " 7.00 m/s at an angle of u0 " 35.0°,
what percent of the jump’s range does the player spend in the up-
per half of the jump (between maximum height and half maxi-
mum height)?

A batter hits a pitched ball when the center of
the ball is 1.22 m above the ground. The ball leaves the bat at an
angle of 45° with the ground.With that launch, the ball should have
a horizontal range (returning to the launch level) of 107 m. (a)
Does the ball clear a 7.32-m-high fence that is 97.5 m horizontally
from the launch point? (b) At the fence, what is the distance be-
tween the fence top and the ball center?

In Fig. 4-41, a ball is
thrown up onto a roof, landing

above the release level. The
ball’s path just before landing is
angled at u " 60.0° with the
roof. (a) Find the horizontal dis-
tance d it travels. (See the hint
to Problem 39.) What are the
(b) magnitude and (c) angle
(relative to the horizontal) of
the ball’s initial velocity?

A football kicker can give the ball an initial speed of 
25 m/s. What are the (a) least and (b) greatest elevation angles at
which he can kick the ball to score a field goal from a point 50 m in
front of goalposts whose horizontal bar is 3.44 m above the ground?

Two seconds after being projected from ground level, a
projectile is displaced 40 m horizontally and 53 m vertically
above its launch point. What are the (a) horizontal and (b)
vertical components of the initial velocity of the projectile? (c)
At the instant the projectile achieves its maximum height above
ground level, how far is it displaced horizontally from the launch
point?

A skilled skier knows to jump upward before reaching a
downward slope. Consider a jump in which the launch speed is 
v0 " 10 m/s, the launch angle is u0 " 11.3°, the initial course is
approximately flat, and the steeper track has a slope of 9.0°.
Figure 4-42a shows a prejump that allows the skier to land on the top
portion of the steeper track. Figure 4-42b shows a jump at the edge
of the steeper track. In Fig. 4-42a, the skier lands at approximately
the launch level. (a) In the landing, what is the angle f between the
skier’s path and the slope? In Fig. 4-42b, (b) how far below the
launch level does the skier land and (c) what is f? (The greater fall
and greater f can result in loss of control in the landing.)

In Fig. 4-44, a baseball is hit at a height h " 1.00 m and
then caught at the same height. It travels alongside a wall, moving
up past the top of the wall 1.00 s after it is hit and then down past
the top of the wall 4.00 s later, at distance D " 50.0 m farther along
the wall. (a) What horizontal distance is traveled by the ball from
hit to catch? What are the (b) magnitude and (c) angle (relative to
the horizontal) of the ball’s velocity just after being hit? (d) How

A ball is to be shot from
level ground with a certain speed.
Figure 4-45 shows the range R it will
have versus the launch angle u0. The
value of u0 determines the flight
time; let tmax represent the maximum
flight time. What is the least speed
the ball will have during its flight if
u0 is chosen such that the flight time
is 0.500tmax?

A ball rolls horizontally off the top of a stairway with
a speed of 1.52 m/s. The steps are 20.3 cm high and 20.3 cm wide.
Which step does the ball hit first?
