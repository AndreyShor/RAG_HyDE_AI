A square wire loop 20 cm on a side, with resistance
20 m , has its plane normal to a uniform magnetic field of magni-
tude B ! 2.0 T. If you pull two opposite sides of the loop away
from each other, the other two sides automatically draw toward
each other, reducing the area enclosed by the loop. If the area is re-
duced to zero in time )t ! 0.20 s, what are (a) the average emf and
(b) the average current induced in the loop during )t?

about 8 & 104 light-years.)
