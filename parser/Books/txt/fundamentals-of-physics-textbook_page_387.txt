13-3 GRAVITATION NEAR EARTH’S SURFACE
as Earth turns, the crate has a centripetal acceleration 
directed toward
Earth’s center. From Eq. 10-23 (ar ! v2r), we know this acceleration is equal to
v2R, where v is Earth’s angular speed and R is the circle’s radius (approxi-
mately Earth’s radius). Thus, we can write Newton’s second law for forces
along the r axis (Fnet,r ! mar) as
FN % mag ! m(%v2R).
(13-12)
The magnitude FN of the normal force is equal to the weight mg read on the scale.
With mg substituted for FN, Eq. 13-12 gives us
mg ! mag % m(v2R),
(13-13)
which says
Thus, the measured weight is less than the magnitude of the gravitational force
on the crate, because of Earth’s rotation.
Acceleration Difference. To find a corresponding expression for g and ag, we
cancel m from Eq. 13-13 to write
g ! ag % v2R,
(13-14)
which says
Thus, the measured free-fall acceleration is less than the gravitational accelera-
tion because of Earth’s rotation.
Equator. The difference between accelerations g and ag is equal to v2R and
is greatest on the equator (for one reason, the radius of the circle traveled by the
crate is greatest there). To find the difference, we can use Eq. 10-5 (v ! 'u/'t)
and Earth’s radius R ! 6.37 $ 106 m. For one rotation of Earth, u is 2p rad and
the time period 't is about 24 h. Using these values (and converting hours to sec-
onds), we find that g is less than ag by only about 0.034 m/s2 (small compared to
9.8 m/s2). Therefore, neglecting the difference in accelerations g and ag is often
justified. Similarly, neglecting the difference between weight and the magnitude
of the gravitational force is also often justified.
