In a game of lawn chess, where pieces are moved between
the centers of squares that are each 1.00 m on edge, a knight is
moved in the following way: (1) two squares forward, one square
rightward; (2) two squares leftward, one square forward; (3) two
squares forward, one square leftward. What are (a) the magnitude
and (b) the angle (relative to “forward”) of the knight’s overall dis-
placement for the series of three moves?
