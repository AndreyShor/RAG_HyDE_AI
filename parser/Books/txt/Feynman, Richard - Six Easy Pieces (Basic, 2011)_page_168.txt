get an upward kick. If the electron goes through the lower hole,
the plate should feel a downward kick. It is clear that for every po-
sition of the detector, the momentum received by the plate will
have a different value for a traversal via hole 1 than for a traversal
via hole 2. So! Without disturbing the electrons at all, but just by
watching the plate, we can tell which path the electron used.
Now in order to do this it is necessary to know what the mo-
mentum of the screen is, before the electron goes through. So when
we measure the momentum after the electron goes by, we can ﬁgure
out how much the plate’s momentum has changed. But remember,
according to the uncertainty principle we cannot at the same time
know the position of the plate with an arbitrary accuracy. But if we
do not know exactly where the plate is we cannot say precisely
where the two holes are. They will be in a different place for every
electron that goes through. This means that the center of our in-
terference pattern will have a different location for each electron.
The wiggles of the interference pattern will be smeared out. We
shall show quantitatively in the next chapter that if we determine
the momentum of the plate sufficiently accurately to determine
from the recoil measurement which hole was used, then the uncer-
tainty in the x-position of the plate will, according to the uncer-
tainty principle, be enough to shift the pattern observed at the
