CHAPTER 7
KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK
Work Done by the Gravitational Force
We next examine the work done on an object by the gravitational force acting on
it. Figure 7-6 shows a particle-like tomato of mass m that is thrown upward with
initial speed v0 and thus with initial kinetic energy 
. As the tomato

Figure 7-7 (a) An applied force 
lifts an
object. The object’s displacement 
makes
an angle f " 1803 with the gravitational
force 
on the object. The applied force
does positive work on the object. (b) An
applied force 
lowers an object. The dis-
placement 
of the object makes an angle

with the gravitational force

applied force does negative work on the
object.

the tomato as a particle, we can use Eq. 7-7 (W " Fd cos f) to express the work
done during a displacement . For the force magnitude F, we use mg as the mag-
nitude of F
:
g.Thus, the work Wg done by the gravitational force F
:
g is
Wg " mgd cos f
(work done by gravitational force).
(7-12)
For a rising object, force F
:
g is directed opposite the displacement , as indi-
cated in Fig. 7-6.Thus, f " 1803 and
Wg " mgd cos 1803 " mgd($1) " $mgd.
(7-13)
The minus sign tells us that during the object’s rise, the gravitational force acting
on the object transfers energy in the amount mgd from the kinetic energy of the
object.This is consistent with the slowing of the object as it rises.
After the object has reached its maximum height and is falling back down,
the angle f between force 
and displacement 
is zero.Thus,
Wg " mgd cos 03 " mgd(#1) " #mgd.
(7-14)
The plus sign tells us that the gravitational force now transfers energy in the amount
mgd to the kinetic energy of the falling object (it speeds up,of course).
Work Done in Lifting and Lowering an Object
Now suppose we lift a particle-like object by applying a vertical force 
to it.
During the upward displacement, our applied force does positive work Wa on the
object while the gravitational force does negative work Wg on it. Our applied
force tends to transfer energy to the object while the gravitational force tends to
transfer energy from it. By Eq. 7-10, the change -K in the kinetic energy of the
object due to these two energy transfers is
-K " Kf $ Ki " Wa # Wg,
(7-15)
in which Kf is the kinetic energy at the end of the displacement and Ki is that at
the start of the displacement. This equation also applies if we lower the object,
but then the gravitational force tends to transfer energy to the object while our
force tends to transfer energy from it.
If an object is stationary before and after a lift (as when you lift a book from
the floor to a shelf),then Kf and Ki are both zero,and Eq.7-15 reduces to
Wa # Wg " 0
or
Wa " $Wg.
(7-16)
Note that we get the same result if Kf and Ki are not zero but are still equal.
Either way, the result means that the work done by the applied force is the nega-
tive of the work done by the gravitational force; that is, the applied force transfers
the same amount of energy to the object as the gravitational force transfers from
the object. Using Eq. 7-12, we can rewrite Eq. 7-16 as
Wa " $mgd cos f
(work done in lifting and lowering; Kf " Ki),
(7-17)
with f being the angle between 
and . If the displacement is vertically upward
