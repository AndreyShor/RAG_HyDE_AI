Radioactive Decay
As Fig. 42-5 shows, most nuclides are radioactive. They each spontaneously
(randomly) emit a particle and transform into a different nuclide. Thus these de-
cays reveal that the laws for subatomic processes are statistical. For example, in a
1 mg sample of uranium metal, with 2.5 " 1018 atoms of the very long-lived ra-
dionuclide 238 U, only about 12 of the nuclei will decay in a given second by emit-
ting an alpha particle and transforming into a nucleus of 234 Th. However,

CHAPTER 42
NUCLEAR PHYSICS
●Most nuclides spontaneously decay at a rate R ! dN/dt that
is proportional to the number N of radioactive atoms present.
The proportionality constant is the disintegration constant l.
●The number of radioactive nuclei is given as a function of time by
where N0 is the number at time t ! 0.
●The rate at which the nuclei decay is given as a function of time
N ! N0e#lt,
by
where R0 is the rate at time t ! 0.
●The half-life T1/2 and the mean life t are measures of how
quickly radioactive nuclei decay and are related by
T1/2 ! ln 2
l
! t ln 2.
R ! R0e#lt,
Key Ideas
There is absolutely no way to predict whether any given nucleus in a radioactive
sample will be among the small number of nuclei that decay during any given 
second. All have the same chance.
Although we cannot predict which nuclei in a sample will decay,we can say that if
a sample contains N radioactive nuclei, then the rate (! #dN/dt) at which nuclei will
decay is proportional to N:
(42-11)
in which l, the disintegration constant (or decay constant) has a characteristic
value for every radionuclide. Its SI unit is the inverse second (s#1).
To find N as a function of time t, we first rearrange Eq. 42-11 as
(42-12)
and then integrate both sides, obtaining
or
ln N # ln N0 ! #l(t # t0).

After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
42.11 Explain what is meant by radioactive decay and identify
that it is a random process.
42.12 Identify disintegration constant (or decay constant) l.
42.13 Identify that, at any given instant, the rate dN/dt at
which radioactive nuclei decay is proportional to the
number N of them still present then.
42.14 Apply the relationship that gives the number N of
radioactive nuclei as a function of time.
42.15 Apply the relationship that gives the decay rate R of
radioactive nuclei as a function of time.
42.16 For any given time, apply the relationship between the de-
cay rate R and the remaining number N of radioactive nuclei.
42.17 Identify activity.
42.18 Distinguish Becquerel (Bq), curie (Ci), and counts per
unit time.

42.20 Apply the relationship between half-life T1/2, mean life t,
and disintegration constant l.
42.21 Identify that in any nuclear process, including radioactive
decay, the charge and the number of nucleons are conserved.
