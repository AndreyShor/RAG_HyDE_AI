23-4 APPLYING GAUSS’ LAW: CYLINDRICAL SYMMETRY
Applying Gauss’ Law: Cylindrical Symmetry
Figure 23-14 shows a section of an infinitely long cylindrical plastic rod with a uni-
form charge density l. We want to find an expression for the electric field magni-
tude E at radius r from the central axis of the rod, outside the rod. We could do
that using the approach of Chapter 22 (charge element dq, field vector 
, etc.).
However,Gauss’ law gives a much faster and easier (and prettier) approach.
The charge distribution and the field have cylindrical symmetry. To find the
field at radius r, we enclose a section of the rod with a concentric Gaussian
cylinder of radius r and height h. (If you want the field at a certain point, put a
Gaussian surface through that point.) We can now apply Gauss’ law to relate the
charge enclosed by the cylinder and the net flux through the cylinder’s surface.
First note that because of the symmetry, the electric field at any point must
be radially outward (the charge is positive). That means that at any point on the
end caps, the field only skims the surface and does not pierce it. So, the flux
through each end cap is zero.
To find the flux through the cylinder’s curved surface, first note that for any
patch element on the surface, the area vector 
is radially outward (away from
the interior of the Gaussian surface) and thus in the same direction as the field
piercing the patch.The dot product in Gauss’ law is then simply E dA cos 0 $ E dA,
and we can pull E out of the integral.The remaining integral is just the instruction
to sum the areas of all patch elements on the cylinder’s curved surface, but we al-
ready know that the total area is the product of the cylinder’s height h and cir-
cumference 2pr.The net flux through the cylinder is then
On the other side of Gauss’s law we have the charge qenc enclosed by the
cylinder. Because the linear charge density (charge per unit length, remember) is
uniform, the enclosed charge is lh.Thus, Gauss’ law,
´0& $ qenc,
reduces to
´0E(2prh) $ lh,
yielding
