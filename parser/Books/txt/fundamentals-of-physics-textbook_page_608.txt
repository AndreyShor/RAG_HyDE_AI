In a motorcycle engine, a
piston is forced down toward
the crankshaft when the fuel
in the top of the pistonâ€™s
cylinder undergoes combustion. The mixture of gaseous combus-
tion products then expands adiabatically as the piston descends.
Find the average power in (a) watts and (b) horsepower that is in-
volved in this expansion when the engine is running at 4000 rpm,
assuming that the gauge pressure immediately after combustion is
15 atm, the initial volume is 50 cm3, and the volume of the mixture
at the bottom of the stroke is 250 cm3. Assume that the gases are
diatomic and that the time involved in the expansion is one-half
that of the total cycle.

For adiabatic processes in an ideal gas, show that (a) the bulk
modulus is given by 
where g # Cp/CV. (See Eq. 17-2.) (b) Then show that the speed of
sound in the gas is
where r is the density, T is the temperature, and M is the molar
mass. (See Eq. 17-3.)
92
Air at 0.000-C and 1.00 atm pressure has a density of 1.29 ' 10$3
g/cm3, and the speed of sound is 331 m/s at that temperature.
Compute the ratio g of the molar specific heats of air. (Hint: See
Problem 91.)
93
The speed of sound in different gases at a certain tempera-
ture T depends on the molar mass of the gases. Show that
where v1 is the speed of sound in a gas of molar mass M1 and v2 is the
speed of sound in a gas of molar mass M2.(Hint: See Problem 91.)
94
From the knowledge that CV, the molar specific heat at con-
stant volume, for a gas in a container is 5.0R, calculate the ratio of
the speed of sound in that gas to the rms speed of the molecules,
for gas temperature T. (Hint: See Problem 91.)

The molar mass of iodine is 127 g/mol. When sound at fre-
quency 1000 Hz is introduced to a tube of iodine gas at 400 K, an
internal acoustic standing wave is set up with nodes separated by
9.57 cm.What is g for the gas? (Hint: See Problem 91.)
96
For air near 0-C,by how much does the speed of sound increase
for each increase in air temperature by 1 C-? (Hint: See Problem 91.)

Two containers are at the same temperature. The gas in the
first container is at pressure p1 and has molecules with mass m1

sure 2p1 and has molecules with mass m2 and average speed
vavg2 # 2vrms1. Find the ratio m1/m2 of the masses of their molecules.

initial temperature is 300 K. If the gas is monatomic and the expan-
sion isothermal, what are the (a) final pressure pf, (b) final temper-
ature Tf, and (c) work W done by the gas? If the gas is monatomic
and the expansion adiabatic, what are (d) pf, (e) Tf, and (f) W? If

An ideal gas with 3.00 mol is initially in state 1 with pressure
p1 # 20.0 atm and volume V1 # 1500 cm3. First it is taken to state 2
with pressure p2 # 1.50p1 and volume V2 # 2.00V1.Then it is taken
to state 3 with pressure p3
2.00p1 and volume V3
0.500V1.

In an industrial process the volume of 25.0 mol of a monatomic
ideal gas is reduced at a uniform rate from 0.616 m3 to 0.308 m3 in
2.00 h while its temperature is increased at a uniform rate from
27.0-C to 450-C. Throughout the process, the gas passes through
thermodynamic equilibrium states. What are (a) the cumulative
work done on the gas,(b) the cumulative energy absorbed by the gas
as heat, and (c) the molar specific heat for the process? (Hint: To
evaluate the integral for the work,you might use
an indefinite integral.) Suppose the process is replaced with a two-
step process that reaches the same final state. In step 1, the gas 
volume is reduced at constant temperature,and in step 2 the tempera-
ture is increased at constant volume. For this process, what are (d) the
cumulative work done on the gas,(e) the cumulative energy absorbed
by the gas as heat,and (f) the molar specific heat for the process?

ternal energy of the gas along path CD?
