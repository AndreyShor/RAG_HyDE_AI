Dispersion in a window pane. In
Fig. 33-54, a beam of white light is incident at an-
gle u
50 on a common window pane (shown
in cross section). For the pane’s type of glass, the
index of refraction for visible light ranges from
1.524 at the blue end of the spectrum to 1.509 at
the red end. The two sides of the pane are paral-
lel.What is the angular spread of the colors in the
beam (a) when the light enters the pane and
(b) when it emerges from the opposite side?
(Hint: When you look at an object through a window pane, are
the colors in the light from the object dispersed as shown in, say,
Fig. 33-20?)

In Fig. 33-55, a 2.00-
m-long vertical pole extends from
the bottom of a swimming pool to a
point 50.0 cm above the
water.
Sunlight is incident at angle u !
55.0°. What is the length of the
shadow of the pole on the level bot-
tom of the pool?

Rainbows from square
drops. Suppose that, on some sur-
real world, raindrops had a square cross sec-
tion and always fell with one face horizontal.
Figure 33-56 shows such a falling drop, with a
white beam of sunlight incident at u ! 70.0° at
point P. The part of the light that enters the
drop then travels to point A, where some of it
refracts out into the air and the rest reflects.
That reflected light then travels to point B,
where again some of the light refracts out into
the air and the rest reflects. What is the differ-
ence in the angles of the red light (n ! 1.331)
and the blue light (n ! 1.343) that emerge at

material 1? (b) If the incident angle is changed to 60° and material
2 has n2 ! 2.4, then what is angle u2?

In Fig. 33-53, a ray is incident on one face
of a triangular glass prism in air.The angle of incidence u is chosen
so that the emerging ray also makes the same angle u with the nor-
mal to the other face. Show that the index of refraction n of the
glass prism is given by
where f is the vertex angle of the prism and c is the deviation
angle, the total angle through which the beam is turned in passing
through the prism. (Under these conditions the deviation angle c
has the smallest possible value, which is called the angle of mini-
mum deviation.)

width.)

of water. Find the diameter of the circle at the surface through
which light emerges from the water.

The index of refraction of benzene is 1.8. What is the critical
angle for a light ray traveling in benzene toward a flat layer of air
above the benzene?

In Fig. 33-57, a ray
of light is perpendicular to the face
ab of a glass prism (n ! 1.52). Find
the largest value for the angle f so
that the ray is totally reflected at
face ac if the prism is immersed
(a) in air and (b) in water.

In Fig. 33-58, light from ray A
refracts from material 1 (n1 ! 1.60)
into a thin layer of material 2 (n2 !
1.80), crosses that layer, and is then
incident at the critical angle on the
interface between materials 2 and 3
(n3 ! 1.30). (a) What is the value
of incident angle uA? (b) If uA is
decreased, does part of the light
refract into material 3?
Light from ray B refracts from material 1 into the thin layer,
crosses that layer, and is then incident at the critical angle on the
interface between materials 2 and 3. (c) What is the value of inci-
dent angle uB? (d) If uB is decreased, does part of the light refract
into material 3?
••61
In Fig. 33-59, light initially
in material 1 refracts into material 2,
crosses that material, and is then
incident at the critical angle on the
interface between materials 2 and 3.
The indexes of refraction are 
n1 ! 1.60, n2 ! 1.40, and n3 ! 1.20.

creased, is there refraction of light
into material 3?

the same?

In Fig. 33-60, light enters a 90°
triangular prism at point P with inci-
dent angle u, and then some of it
refracts at point Q with an angle of
refraction of 90°. (a) What is the in-
dex of refraction of the prism in
terms of u? (b) What, numerically,
is the maximum value that the index of refraction can have? Does
light emerge at Q if the incident angle at P is (c) increased slightly
and (d) decreased slightly?
