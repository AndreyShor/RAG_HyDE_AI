THE  LORENTZ  TRANSFORMATION    117 
The  same  value  v  can  be  obtained  from  equation  (5), 
if  we  calculate  the  velocity  of  another  point  of  K' 
relative  to  K,  or  the  velocity  (directed  towards  the 
negative  #-axis)  of  a  point  of  K  with  respect  to  K'.  In 
short,  we  can  designate  v  as  the  relative  velocity  of  the 
two  systems. 
Furthermore,  the  principle  of  relativity  teaches  us 
that,  as  judged  from  K,  the  length  of  a  unit  measuring- 
rod  which  is  at  rest  with  reference  to  K'  must  be  exactly 
the  same  as  the  length,  as  judged  from  K',  of  a  unit 
measuring-rod  which  is  at  rest  relative  to  K.  In  order 
to  see  how  the  points  of  the  #'-axis  appear  as  viewed 
from  K,  we  only  require  to  take  a  "snapshot"  of  K' 
from  K  ;  this  means  that  we  have  to  insert  a  particular 
value  of  t  (time  of  K),  e.g.  t=o.  For  this  value  of  t 
we  then  obtain  from  the  first  of  the  equations  (5) 
x'=ax. 
Two  points  of  the  #'-axis  which  are  separated  by  the 
distance  A#'=i  when  measured  in  the  K'  system  are 
thus  separated  in  our  instantaneous  photograph  by  the 
distance 
A,-!        .          .         .         (7). 
But  if  the  snapshot  be  taken  from  K'(t'=o),  and  if 
we  eliminate  t  from  the  equations  (5),  taking  into 
account  the  expression  (6),  we  obtain 
From  this  we  conclude  that  two  points  on  the  #-axis 
and  separated  by  the  distance  i  (relative  to  K)  will 
be  represented  on  our  snapshot  by  the  distance
