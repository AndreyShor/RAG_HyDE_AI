20-3 REFRIGERATORS AND REAL ENGINES
(e) By how much does the entropy of the working substance
change as a result of the energy transferred to it from the
high-temperature reservoir? From it to the low-temperature
reservoir?
KEY IDEA
The entropy change %S during a transfer of energy as heat Q at
constant temperature T is given by Eq.20-2 (%S # Q/T).
Calculations: Thus, for the positive transfer of energy QH
from the high-temperature reservoir at TH, the change in the
entropy of the working substance is
(Answer)
Similarly, for the negative transfer of energy QL to the 
low-temperature reservoir at TL, we have
(Answer)
Note that the net entropy change of the working substance for
one cycle is zero,as we discussed in deriving Eq.20-10.

Calculation: From Eq. 20-13, we find that the efficiency of a
Carnot engine operating between the boiling and freezing
points of water is
Thus, for the given temperatures, the claimed efficiency of
75% for a real engine (with its irreversible processes and
wasteful energy transfers) is impossible.

Sample Problem 20.04
Impossibly efficient engine
An inventor claims to have constructed an engine that has
an efficiency of 75% when operated between the boiling
and freezing points of water. Is this possible?
KEY IDEA
The efficiency of a real engine must be less than the effi-
ciency of a Carnot engine operating between the same two
temperatures.
20-3 REFRIGERATORS AND REAL ENGINES
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
20.16 Identify that a refrigerator is a device that uses work to
transfer energy from a low-temperature reservoir to a 
high-temperature reservoir, and that an ideal refrigerator is
one that does this with reversible processes and no wasteful
losses.
20.17 Sketch a p-V diagram for the cycle of a Carnot refriger-
ator, indicating the direction of cycling, the nature of the
processes involved, the work done during each process
(including algebraic sign), the net work done in the cycle,
and the heat transferred during each process (including
algebraic sign).
20.18 Apply the relationship between the coefficient of
performance K and the heat exchanges with the reservoirs
and the temperatures of the reservoirs.
20.19 Identify that there is no ideal refrigerator in which all of
the energy extracted from the low-temperature reservoir is
transferred to the high-temperature reservoir.
20.20 Identify that the efficiency of a real engine is less
than that of the ideal Carnot engine.
Learning Objectives
●A refrigerator is a device that, operating in a cycle, has
work W done on it as it extracts energy +QL+ as heat from a
low-temperature reservoir. The coefficient of performance K
of a refrigerator is defined as

●A perfect refrigerator is an entirely imaginary refrigerator
in which energy extracted as heat from the low-temperature
reservoir is somehow converted completely to heat dis-
charged to the high-temperature reservoir without any
need for work. 
●A perfect refrigerator would violate the second law of
thermodynamics, which can be restated as follows: No se-
ries of processes is possible whose sole result is the trans-
fer of energy as heat from a reservoir at a given tempera-
ture to a reservoir at a higher temperature (without work
being involved).
