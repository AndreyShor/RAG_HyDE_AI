counterclockwise current i in the larger loop is nearly uniform
throughout the smaller loop. Suppose that x is increasing at the
constant rate dx/dt ! v. (a) Find an expression for the magnetic
flux through the area of the smaller loop as a function of x. (Hint:

A wire is bent into three
circular segments, each of radius r !
10 cm, as shown in Fig. 30-48. Each
segment is a quadrant of a circle,
ab lying in the xy plane, bc lying in
the yz plane, and ca lying in the zx
plane. (a) If a uniform magnetic
field 
points in the positive x direc-
tion, what is the magnitude of the
emf developed in the wire when B
increases at the rate of 3.0 mT/s?

current in segment bc?

Two long, parallel copper wires of diameter 2.5 mm carry
currents of 10 A in opposite directions. (a) Assuming that their
central axes are 20 mm apart, calculate the magnetic flux per meter

centage of this flux lies inside the wires? (c) Repeat part (a) for
parallel currents.

rected out of the page; its magnitude

ance R ! 0.40 m1 is placed near an infinitely long wire carrying
current i ! 4.7 A. The loop is then moved away from the wire at
constant speed v ! 3.2 mm/s. When the center of the loop is at
distance r ! 1.5b, what are (a) the magnitude of the magnetic flux

of or into the page as indicated. Figure 30-44b gives the change in

A small circular loop of area 2.00 cm2 is placed in the plane
of, and concentric with, a large circular loop of radius 1.00 m. The
current in the large loop is changed at a constant rate from 200 A
to %200 A (a change in direction) in a time of 1.00 s, starting at 
t ! 0. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field 
at the center
of the small loop due to the current in the large loop at (a) t ! 0,
(b) t ! 0.500 s, and (c) t ! 1.00 s? (d) From t ! 0 to t ! 1.00 s, is

ducting rails form a right angle. A

rails starts at the vertex at time t ! 0

field with B ! 0.350 T is directed
out of the page. Calculate (a) the

placed entirely in a uniform magnetic field with magnitude B !

nected in series to a meter with 140 1 resistance.The coil is flipped
through a half-revolution about a diameter, so that it is again hori-
zontal. How much charge flows
