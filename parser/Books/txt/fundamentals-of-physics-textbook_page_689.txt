23-1 ELECTRIC FLUX
We are about to integrate over the right face, but we note
that x has the same value everywhere on that face—namely,
x $ 3.0 m. This means we can substitute that constant value
for x. This can be a confusing argument. Although x is cer-
tainly a variable as we move left to right across the figure,
because the right face is perpendicular to the x axis, every
point on the face has the same x coordinate. (The y and z co-
ordinates do not matter in our integral.) Thus, we have
The integral 
merely gives us the area A
4.0 m2 of the
right face, so

Sample Problem 23.02
Flux through a closed cube, nonuniform field
A nonuniform electric field given by 
pierces the Gaussian cube shown in Fig. 23-7a. (E is in
newtons per coulomb and x is in meters.) What is the
electric flux through the right face, the left face, and the top
face? (We consider the other faces in another sample
problem.)
KEY IDEA
We can find the flux & through the surface by integrating
the scalar product 
over each face.
Right face: An area vector 
is always perpendicular to its
surface and always points away from the interior of a
Gaussian surface.Thus, the vector 
for any patch element
(small section) on the right face of the cube must point in
the positive direction of the x axis. An example of such an
element is shown in Figs. 23-7b and c, but we would have an
identical vector for any other choice of a patch element
on that face.The most convenient way to express the vector
is in unit-vector notation,
From Eq. 23-4, the flux &r through the right face is then

axis lies within a nonuniform electric field that de-
pends on the value of x. (b) Each patch element has an
outward vector that is perpendicular to the area. (c)
Right face: the x component of the field pierces the
area and produces positive (outward) flux.The y com-
ponent does not pierce the area and thus does not
produce any flux. (Figure continues on following page)

The y component of the
field skims the surface
and gives no flux. The
dot product is just zero.
The x component of the

The dot product is positive.
