Optical Instruments
The human eye is a remarkably effective organ, but its range can be extended in
many ways by optical instruments such as eyeglasses, microscopes, and tele-
scopes. Many such devices extend the scope of our vision beyond the visible
range; satellite-borne infrared cameras and x-ray microscopes are just two
examples.
The mirror and thin-lens formulas can be applied only as approximations to
most sophisticated optical instruments. The lenses in typical laboratory micro-
scopes are by no means “thin.” In most optical instruments the lenses are com-
pound lenses; that is, they are made of several components, the interfaces rarely
being exactly spherical. Now we discuss three optical instruments, assuming, for
simplicity, that the thin-lens formulas apply.
●The angular magnification of a simple magnifying lens is
where f is the focal length of the lens and 25 cm is a
reference value for the near point value.
●The overall magnification of a compound microscope is

where m is the lateral magnification of the objective, mu
is the angular magnification of the eyepiece, s is the tube
length, fob is the focal length of the objective, and fey is the
focal length of the eyepiece.

34.41 Identify that the overall magnification of a compound
microscope is due to the lateral magnification by the
objective and the angular magnification by the 
eyepiece.

Learning Objectives
of lens 2. So the image I2 produced by lens 2 must be real, in-
verted, and on the side of the lens opposite O2. Let us see.
The distance p2 between this object O2 and lens 2 is,
from Fig. 34-18c,
p2 ! L ' |i1| ! 10 cm ' 8.0 cm ! 18 cm.
Then Eq. 34-9, now written for lens 2, yields
Hence,
i2 ! '18 cm.
(Answer)
The plus sign confirms our guess: Image I2 produced by lens
2 is real, inverted, and on the side of lens 2 opposite O2, as
shown in Fig. 34-18c. Thus, the image would appear on a
card placed at its location.
