What harmonic frequency is next higher after the harmonic fre-
quency 195 Hz?

If a transmission line in a cold climate collects ice, the
increased diameter tends to cause vortex formation in a passing
wind. The air pressure variations in the vortexes tend to cause the
line to oscillate (gallop), especially if the frequency of the varia-
tions matches a resonant frequency of the line. In long lines, the
resonant frequencies are so close that almost any wind speed can
set up a resonant mode vigorous enough to pull down support tow-
ers or cause the line to short out with an adjacent line. If a transmis-
sion line has a length of 347 m, a linear density of 3.35 kg/m, and a
tension of 65.2 MN, what are (a) the frequency of the fundamental
mode and (b) the frequency difference between successive modes?

A nylon guitar string has a
linear density of 7.20 g/m and is under a
tension of 150 N.The fixed supports are
distance D # 90.0 cm apart. The string
is oscillating in the standing wave pat-
tern shown in Fig. 16-39. Calculate the (a) speed, (b) wavelength, and
(c) frequency of the traveling waves whose superposition gives this
standing wave.

For a particular transverse
standing wave on a long string, one
of the antinodes is at x # 0 and an
adjacent node is at x # 0.10 m. The
displacement y(t) of the string parti-
cle at x # 0 is shown in Fig. 16-40,
where the scale of the y axis is set by
ys # 4.0 cm. When t # 0.50 s, what is
the displacement of the string particle
at (a) x # 0.20 m and (b) x # 0.30 m?
What is the transverse velocity of the string particle at x # 0.20 m at
(c) t # 0.50 s and (d) t # 1.0 s? (e) Sketch the standing wave at t #
0.50 s for the range x # 0 to x # 0.40 m.

Two waves are generated on a string of length
3.0 m to produce a three-loop standing wave with an amplitude of
1.0 cm. The wave speed is 100 m/s. Let the equation for one of the
waves be of the form y(x, t) # ym sin(kx " vt). In the equation for the
other wave, what are (a) ym, (b) k, (c) v, and (d) the sign in front of v?

where x # 0 at one end of the rope, x is in meters, and t is in sec-
onds. What are (a) the length of the rope, (b) the speed of the
waves on the rope, and (c) the mass of the rope? (d) If the rope os-
cillates in a third-harmonic standing wave pattern, what will be the
period of oscillation?

Two sinusoidal waves
with the same amplitude and
wavelength travel through each
other along a string that is
stretched along an x axis. Their
resultant wave is shown twice
in Fig. 16-41, as the antinode A
travels from an extreme up-
ward displacement to an ex-
treme downward displacement
in 6.0 ms. The tick marks along
the axis are separated by 10 cm; height H is 1.80 cm. Let the equation
for one of the two waves be of the form y(x, t) # ym sin(kx " vt). In
the equation for the other wave, what are (a) ym, (b) k, (c) v, and (d)
the sign in front of v?

The following two waves are sent in opposite directions
on a horizontal string so as to create a standing wave in a vertical
plane:
y1(x, t) # (6.00 mm) sin(4.00px $ 400pt)
y2(x, t) # (6.00 mm) sin(4.00px " 400pt),
with x in meters and t in seconds.An antinode is located at point A.

ward displacement to maximum downward displacement, how far
does each wave move along the string?

est, and (c) third smallest value of x? (d) What is the period of the
oscillatory motion of any (nonnode) point? What are the (e)
speed and (f) amplitude of the two traveling waves that interfere
to produce this wave? For t 0 0, what are the (g) first, (h) second,
and (i) third time that all points on the string have zero trans-
verse velocity?
