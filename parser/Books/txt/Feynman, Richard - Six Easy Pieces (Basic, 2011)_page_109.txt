Therefore W = 3/5 of a pound. Note that we deduced this from
the conservation of energy, and not from force components. Clever-
ness, however, is relative. It can be deduced in a way which is even
more brilliant, discovered by Stevinus and inscribed on his tomb-
stone. Figure 4-4 explains that it has to be 3/5 of a pound, because
the chain does not go around. It is evident that the lower part of
the chain is balanced by itself, so that the pull of the ﬁve weights
on one side must balance the pull of three weights on the other, or
whatever the ratio of the legs. You see, by looking at this diagram,
that W must be 3/5 of a pound. (If you get an epitaph like that on
your gravestone, you are doing ﬁne.)
Let us now illustrate the energy principle with a more compli-
cated problem, the screw jack shown in Fig. 4-5. A handle 20
inches long is used to turn the screw, which has 10 threads to the
inch. We would like to know how much force would be needed at
the handle to lift one ton (2000 pounds). If we want to lift the ton
1 inch, say, then we must turn the handle around ten times. When
it goes around once it goes approximately 126 inches. The handle
must thus travel 1260 inches, and if we used various pulleys, etc.,
we would be lifting our one ton with an unknown smaller weight
W applied to the end of the handle. So we ﬁnd out that W is about
1.6 pounds. This is a result of the conservation of energy.
