CHAPTER 26
CURRENT AND RESISTANCE
Taking copper’s molar mass M and density rmass from
Appendix F, we then have (with some conversions of units)
or
n ! 8.49 $ 10 28 m#3.
Next let us combine the first two key ideas by writing
Substituting for A with pr 2 (! 2.54 $ 10 #6 m2) and solving
for vd, we then find
(Answer)
which is only 1.8 mm/h, slower than a sluggish snail.
Lights are fast: You may well ask: “If the electrons drift so
slowly,why do the room lights turn on so quickly when I throw
the switch?” Confusion on this point results from not distin-
guishing between the drift speed of the electrons and the
speed at which changes in the electric field configuration
travel along wires.This latter speed is nearly that of light; elec-
trons everywhere in the wire begin drifting almost at once, in-
cluding into the lightbulbs. Similarly, when you open the valve
on your garden hose with the hose full of water, a pressure
wave travels along the hose at the speed of sound in water.
The speed at which the water itself moves through the hose—
measured perhaps with a dye marker—is much slower.

Sample Problem 26.03
In a current, the conduction electrons move very slowly
What is the drift speed of the conduction electrons in a
copper wire with radius r ! 900 mm when it has a uniform
current i ! 17 mA? Assume that each copper atom con-
tributes one conduction electron to the current and that
the current density is uniform across the wire’s cross
section.
KEY IDEAS
1. The drift speed vd is related to the current density 
and
the number n of conduction electrons per unit volume
according to Eq. 26-7, which we can write as J ! nevd.
2. Because the current density is uniform, its magnitude J is
related to the given current i and wire size by Eq. 26-5
(J ! i/A, where A is the cross-sectional area of the wire).
3. Because we assume one conduction electron per atom,
the number n of conduction electrons per unit volume is
the same as the number of atoms per unit volume.
Calculations: Let us start with the third idea by writing
The number of atoms per mole is just Avogadro’s number
NA (! 6.02 $ 10 23 mol#1). Moles per unit mass is the inverse
of the mass per mole, which here is the molar mass M of
copper.The mass per unit volume is the (mass) density rmass
of copper.Thus,

26-3 RESISTANCE AND RESISTIVITY
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
26.14 Apply the relationship between the potential difference 
V applied across an object, the object’s resistance R,
and the resulting current i through the object, between the
application points.
26.15 Identify a resistor.
26.16 Apply the relationship between the electric field magni-
tude E set up at a point in a given material, the material’s
resistivity r, and the resulting current density magnitude
J at that point.
26.17 For a uniform electric field set up in a wire, apply 
the relationship between the electric field magnitude E,
the potential difference V between the two ends, and
the wire’s length L.
26.18 Apply the relationship between resistivity r and
conductivity s.
26.19 Apply the relationship between an object’s resistance
R, the resistivity of its material r, its length L, and its cross-
sectional area A.
26.20 Apply the equation that approximately gives a
conductor’s resistivity r as a function of temperature T.
26.21 Sketch a graph of resistivity r versus temperature T for
a metal.
