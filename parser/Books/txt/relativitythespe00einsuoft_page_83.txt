where  the  "  inertial  mass  "  is  a  characteristic  constant 
of  the  accelerated  body.  If  now  gravitation  is  the 
cause  of  the  acceleration,  we  then  have 
(Force)  =  (gravitational  mass)  X  (intensity  of  the 
gravitational  field), 
where  the  "  gravitational  mass  "  is  likewise  a  character 
istic  constant  for  the  body.  From  these  two  relations 
follows : 
(gravitational   mass) 
(acceleration)  =— ^^  mass)— X  (intensity  of  the 
gravitational  field). 
If  now,  as  we  find  from  experience,  the  acceleration  is 
to  be  independent  of  the  nature  and  the  condition  of  the 
body  and  always  the  same  for  a  given  gravitational 
field,  then  the  ratio  of  the  gravitational  to  the  inertial 
mass  must  likewise  be  the  same  for  all  bodies.  By  a 
suitable  choice  of  units  we  can  thus  make  this  ratio 
equal  to  unity.  We  then  have  the  following  law : 
The  gravitational  mass  of  a  body  is  equal  to  its  inertial 
mass. 
It  is  true  that  this  important  law  had  hitherto  been 
recorded  in  mechanics,  but  it  had  not  been  interpreted. 
A  satisfactory  interpretation  can  be  obtained  only  if  we 
recognise  the  following  fact  :  The  same  quality  of  a 
body  manifests  itself  according  to  circumstances  as 
"  inertia"  or  as  "  weight  "  (lit.  "  heaviness  ").  In  the 
following  section  we  shall  show  to  what  extent  this  is 
actually  the  case,  and  how  this  question  is  connected 
with  the  general  postulate  of  relativity.
