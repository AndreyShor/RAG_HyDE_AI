3-2 UNIT VECTORS, ADDING VECTORS BY COMPONENTS
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
3.06 Convert a vector between magnitude-angle and unit-
vector notations.
3.07 Add and subtract vectors in magnitude-angle notation
and in unit-vector notation.
3.08 Identify that, for a given vector, rotating the coordinate
system about the origin can change the vector’s compo-
nents but not the vector itself.
●Unit vectors , , and have magnitudes of unity and are 
directed in the positive directions of the x, y, and z axes,
respectively, in a right-handed coordinate system. We can
write a vector 
in terms of unit vectors as
" axiˆ # ayjˆ # azkˆ ,
a

in which 
, 
, and 
are the vector components of 
and
ax, ay, and az are its scalar components.
●To add vectors in component form, we use the rules
rx " ax # bx
ry " ay # by
rz " az # bz.
Here 
and 
are the vectors to be added, and 
is the vector
sum. Note that we add components axis by axis.

Unit Vectors
A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of exactly 1 and points in a particu-
lar direction. It lacks both dimension and unit. Its sole purpose is to point—that
is, to specify a direction.The unit vectors in the positive directions of the x, y, and
z axes are labeled , , and , where the hat is used instead of an overhead arrow
as for other vectors (Fig. 3-13).The arrangement of axes in Fig. 3-13 is said to be a
right-handed coordinate system. The system remains right-handed if it is rotated
rigidly.We use such coordinate systems exclusively in this book.
Unit vectors are very useful for expressing other vectors; for example, we can
express 
and 
of Figs. 3-7 and 3-8 as
(3-7)
and
.
(3-8)
These two equations are illustrated in Fig. 3-14.The quantities ax and ay are vec-
tors, called the vector components of .The quantities ax and ay are scalars, called
the scalar components of 
(or, as before, simply its components).

Adding Vectors by Components
We can add vectors geometrically on a sketch or directly on a vector-capable
calculator.A third way is to combine their components axis by axis.
