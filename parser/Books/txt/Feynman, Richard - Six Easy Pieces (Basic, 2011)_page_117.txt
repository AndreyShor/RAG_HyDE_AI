Finally, we remark on the question of where we can get our sup-
plies of energy today. Our supplies of energy are from the sun, rain,
coal, uranium, and hydrogen. The sun makes the rain, and the coal
also, so that all these are from the sun. Although energy is con-
served, nature does not seem to be interested in it; she liberates a
lot of energy from the sun, but only one part in two billion falls
on the earth. Nature has conservation of energy, but does not really
care; she spends a lot of it in all directions. We have already ob-
tained energy from uranium; we can also get energy from hydrogen,
but at present only in an explosive and dangerous condition. If it
can be controlled in thermonuclear reactions, it turns out that the
energy that can be obtained from 10 quarts of water per second is
equal to all of the electrical power generated in the United States.
With 150 gallons of running water a minute, you have enough fuel
to supply all the energy which is used in the United States today!
Therefore it is up to the physicist to Ô¨Ågure out how to liberate us
from the need for having energy. It can be done.
