A charged nonconducting rod, with a length of 2.00 m and a
cross-sectional area of 4.00 cm2, lies along the positive side of an x
axis with one end at the origin. The volume charge density r is
charge per unit volume in coulombs per cubic meter. How many
excess electrons are on the rod if r is (a) uniform, with a value of
%4.00 mC/m3, and (b) nonuniform, with a value given by r ! bx2,
where b ! %2.00 mC/m5?

A particle of charge Q is fixed at the origin of an xy coordi-
nate system. At t ! 0 a particle (m ! 0.800 g, q ! 4.00 mC) is lo-
cated on the x axis at x ! 20.0 cm, moving with a speed of 50.0 m/s
in the positive y direction. For what value of Q will the moving par-
ticle execute circular motion? (Neglect the gravitational force on
the particle.)
53
What would be the magnitude of the electrostatic force be-
tween two 1.00 C point charges separated by a distance of (a) 1.00 m
and (b) 1.00 km if such point charges existed (they do not) and this
configuration could be set up?
54
A charge of 6.0 mC is to be split into two parts that are then
separated by 3.0 mm.What is the maximum possible magnitude of
the electrostatic force between those two parts?

Of the charge Q on a tiny sphere, a fraction a is to be trans-
ferred to a second, nearby sphere. The spheres can be treated as
particles. (a) What value of a maximizes the magnitude F of the elec-
trostatic force between the two spheres? What are the (b) smaller
and (c) larger values of a that put F at half the maximum magnitude?

If a cat repeatedly rubs against your cotton slacks on a
dry day, the charge transfer between the cat hair and the cotton can
leave you with an excess charge of %2.00 mC. (a) How many elec-
trons are transferred between you and the cat?
You will gradually discharge via the floor, but if instead of
waiting, you immediately reach toward a faucet, a painful spark
can suddenly appear as your fingers near the faucet. (b) In that
spark, do electrons flow from you to the faucet or vice versa?
(c) Just before the spark appears, do you induce positive or nega-
tive charge in the faucet? (d) If, instead, the cat reaches a paw
toward the faucet, which way do electrons flow in the resulting
spark? (e) If you stroke a cat with a bare hand on a dry day, you
should take care not to bring your fingers near the cat’s nose or
you will hurt it with a spark. Considering that cat hair is an insula-
tor, explain how the spark can appear.

We know that the negative charge on the electron and the
positive charge on the proton are equal. Suppose, however, that
these magnitudes differ from each other by 0.00010%. With what
force would two copper coins, placed 1.0 m apart, repel each other?
Assume that each coin contains 3 $ 10 22 copper atoms. (Hint: A
neutral copper atom contains 29 protons and 29 electrons.) What
do you conclude?

In Fig. 21-39, two tiny conducting

In Fig. 21-41, three identical con-
ducting spheres form an equilateral tri-

then disconnected; B is grounded by the wire, and the wire is then
removed; B and C are connected by the wire and then discon-
nected.What now are the magnitudes of the electrostatic force (b)
between spheres A and C and (c) between spheres B and C?

Figure 21-42 shows a long, nonconducting, massless rod of
length L, pivoted at its center and balanced with a block of
weight W at a distance x from the left end. At the left and right
ends of the rod are attached small conducting spheres with posi-
tive charges q and 2q, respectively. A distance h directly beneath
each of these spheres is a fixed sphere with positive charge Q. (a)
