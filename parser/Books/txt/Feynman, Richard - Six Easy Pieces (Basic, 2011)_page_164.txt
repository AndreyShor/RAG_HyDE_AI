out that for the bullets the wavelengths were so tiny that the inter-
ference patterns became very ﬁne. So ﬁne, in fact, that with any
detector of ﬁnite size one could not distinguish the separate maxima
and minima. What we saw was only a kind of average, which is the
classical curve. In Fig. 6-5 we have tried to indicate schematically
what happens with large-scale objects. Part (a) of the ﬁgure shows
the probability distribution one might predict for bullets, using
quantum mechanics. The rapid wiggles are supposed to represent
the interference pattern one gets for waves of very short wavelength.
Any physical detector, however, straddles several wiggles of the

probability curve, so that the measurements show the smooth curve
drawn in part (b) of the ﬁgure.
First principles of quantum mechanics
We will now write a summary of the main conclusions of our ex-
periments. We will, however, put the results in a form which makes
them true for a general class of such experiments. We can write our
