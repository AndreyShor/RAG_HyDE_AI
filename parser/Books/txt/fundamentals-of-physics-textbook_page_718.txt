CHAPTER 24
ELECTRIC POTENTIAL
Checkpoint 2
The figure here shows a family of parallel equipotential surfaces (in cross section) and
five paths along which we shall move an electron from one surface to another. (a)
What is the direction of the electric field associated with the surfaces? (b) For each
path, is the work we do positive, negative, or zero? (c) Rank the paths according to the
work we do, greatest first.

The electric field vector points from higher potential toward lower potential.
Thus, the potential difference Vf ' Vi between any two points i and f in an electric
field is equal to the negative of the line integral (meaning the integral along a
particular path) of 
from i to f. However, because the electric force is con-
servative, all paths (whether easy or difficult to use) yield the same result.
Equation 24-18 allows us to calculate the difference in potential between any
two points in the field. If we set potential Vi $ 0, then Eq. 24-18 becomes
(24-19)
in which we have dropped the subscript f on Vf. Equation 24-19 gives us the
potential V at any point f in the electric field relative to the zero potential at point i.
If we let point i be at infinity, then Eq. 24-19 gives us the potential V at any point f
relative to the zero potential at infinity.
Uniform Field. Let’s apply Eq. 24-18 for a uniform field as shown in 
Fig. 24-7.We start at point i on an equipotential line with potential Vi and move to
point f on an equipotential line with a lower potential Vf. The separation between
the two equipotential lines is !x. Let’s also move along a path that is parallel to the
electric field 
(and thus perpendicular to the equipotential lines). The angle be-
tween 
and 
in Eq.24-18 is zero,and the dot product gives us
$ E ds cos 0 $ E ds.
Because E is constant for a uniform field, Eq. 24-18 becomes
Vf ' Vi $ 'E
.
(24-20)
The integral is simply an instruction for us to add all the displacement elements
ds from i to f, but we already know that the sum is length !x. Thus we can write
the change in potential Vf ' Vi in this uniform field as
!V $ 'E !x
(uniform field).
(24-21)
This is the change in voltage !V between two equipotential lines in a uniform field
of magnitude E, separated by distance !x. If we move in the direction of the field
by distance !x,the potential decreases.In the opposite direction,it increases.
