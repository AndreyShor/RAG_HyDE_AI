29-1 MAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT
direction of the current. The direction in which your fingers
curl around the wire indicates the direction of the magnetic
field lines around the wire. They form circles around the
wire, coming out of the page above the arc and going into
the page inside the arc. In the region of point C (inside the
arc), your fingertips point into the plane of the page.Thus,
is directed into that plane.
Net field: Generally, we combine multiple magnetic fields as
vectors. Here, however, only the circular arc produces a
magnetic field at point C. Thus, we can write the magnitude
of the net field 
as

Circular arc: Application of the Biot–Savart law to evalu-
ate the magnetic field at the center of a circular arc leads to
Eq. 29-9 (B ! m0if/4pR). Here the central angle f of the arc
is p/2 rad.Thus from Eq. 29-9, the magnitude of the magnetic
field 
at the arc’s center C is

Sample Problem 29.02
Magnetic field off to the side of two long straight currents
Figure 29-9a shows two long parallel wires carrying currents
i1 and i2 in opposite directions. What are the magnitude and
direction of the net magnetic field at point P? Assume the
following values: i1 ! 15 A, i2 ! 32 A, and d ! 5.3 cm.
KEY IDEAS
(1) The net magnetic field 
at point P is the vector sum of
the magnetic fields due to the currents in the two wires. (2)
We can find the magnetic field due to any current by apply-
ing the Biot–Savart law to the current. For points near the
current in a long straight wire, that law leads to Eq. 29-4.
Finding the vectors: In Fig. 29-9a, point P is distance R
from both currents i1 and i2. Thus, Eq. 29-4 tells us that at
point P those currents produce magnetic fields 
and 
with magnitudes
In the right triangle of Fig. 29-9a, note that the base angles
(between sides R and d) are both 45°.This allows us to write
B1 ! m 0i1
2pR   and  B2 ! m 0i2
