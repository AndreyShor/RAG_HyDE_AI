ratio is shown in Fig. 5-14. The gravitational attraction relative to
the electrical repulsion between two electrons is 1 divided by 4.17
¥ 1042! The question is, where does such a large number come
from? It is not accidental, like the ratio of the volume of the earth
to the volume of a ﬂea. We have considered two natural aspects of
the same thing, an electron. This fantastic number is a natural con-
stant, so it involves something deep in nature. Where could such a
tremendous number come from? Some say that we shall one day
ﬁnd the “universal equation,” and in it, one of the roots will be this
number. It is very difficult to ﬁnd an equation for which such a
fantastic number is a natural root. Other possibilities have been
thought of; one is to relate it to the age of the universe. Clearly, we
have to ﬁnd another large number somewhere. But do we mean the
age of the universe in years? No, because years are not “natural”;
they were devised by men. As an example of something natural, let
us consider the time it takes light to go across a proton, 10–24 sec-
ond. If we compare this time with the age of the universe, 2 ¥ 1010
years, the answer is 10–42. It has about the same number of zeros
going off it, so it has been proposed that the gravitational constant
is related to the age of the universe. If that were the case, the grav-
itational constant would change with time, because as the universe
