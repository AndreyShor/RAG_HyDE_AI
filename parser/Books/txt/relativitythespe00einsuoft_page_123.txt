CONSIDERATIONS  ON  THE  UNIVERSE  AS 
A  WHOLE 
XXX 
COSMOLOGICAL   DIFFICULTIES   OF   NEWTON'S 
THEORY 
APART  from  the  difficulty  discussed  in  Section 
XXI,  there  is  a  second  fundamental  difficulty 
attending  classical  celestial  mechanics,  which, 
to  the  best  of  my  knowledge,  was  first  discussed  in 
detail  by  the  astronomer  Seeliger.  If  we  ponder  over 
the  question  as  to  how  the  universe,  considered  as  a 
whole,  is  to  be  regarded,  the  first  answer  that  suggests 
itself  to  us  is  surely  this  :  As  regards  space  (and  time) 
the  universe  is  infinite.  There  are  stars  everywhere, 
so  that  the  density  of  matter,  although  very  variable 
in  detail,  is  nevertheless  on  the  average  everywhere  the 
same.  In  other  words  :  However  far  we  might  travel 
through  space,  we  should  find  everywhere  an  attenuated 
swarm  of  fixed  stars  of  approximately  the  same  kind 
and  density. 
This  view  is  not   in  harmony  with  the  theory  of 
Newton.    The  latter  theory  rather  requires  that  the 
universe  should  have  a  kind  of  centre  in  which  the
