the x axis to the right of particle 2. Figure 24-58b gives the electric
potential energy U of the three-particle system as a function of the
x coordinate of particle 3. The scale of the vertical axis is set by
Us $ 5.0 J.What is the charge of particle 3?

charged particles, what is the change in the electric potential en-
ergy of the system?

x ! "3.0 m.A particle of charge q ! #15 mC is then released from
rest at a point on the positive part of the y axis. Due to the symme-
try of the situation, the particle moves along the y axis and has ki-
netic energy 1.2 J as it passes through the point x ! 0, y ! 4.0 m.
(a) What is the kinetic energy of the particle as it passes through
the origin? (b) At what negative value of y will the particle mo-
mentarily stop?

initial kinetic energy 4.00 eV. (a) If it is initially moving in the neg-
ative direction of the axis, does it reach a turning point (if so, what
is the x coordinate of that point) or does it escape from the plotted
region (if so, what is its speed at x ! 0)? (b) If it is initially moving
in the positive direction of the axis, does it reach a turning point (if
so, what is the x coordinate of that point) or does it escape from the
plotted region (if so, what is its speed at x ! 6.0 cm)? What are the
(c) magnitude F and (d) direction (positive or negative direction of
the x axis) of the electric force on the proton if the proton moves
just to the left of x

the proton moves just to the right of x ! 5.0 cm?

In Fig. 24-60, a charged particle
(either an electron or a proton) is moving
rightward between two parallel charged
plates separated by distance d ! 2.00 mm.
The plate potentials are V1 ! #70.0 V and
V2 ! #50.0 V. The particle is slowing from
an initial speed of 90.0 km/s at the left
plate. (a) Is the particle an electron or a
proton? (b) What is its speed just as it
reaches plate 2?

In Fig. 24-61a, we move an electron from an infinite distance
to a point at distance R ! 8.00 cm from a tiny charged ball. The
move requires work W ! 2.16 $ 10#13 J by us. (a) What is the
charge Q on the ball? In Fig. 24-61b, the ball has been sliced up and
the slices spread out so that an equal amount of charge is at the
hour positions on a circular clock face of radius R ! 8.00 cm. Now
the electron is brought from an infinite distance to the center of

Suppose N electrons can be placed in either of two
configurations. In configuration 1, they are all placed on the cir-
cumference of a narrow ring of radius R and are uniformly distrib-
uted so that the distance between adjacent electrons is the same
everywhere. In configuration 2, N # 1 electrons are uniformly
distributed on the ring and one electron is placed in the center of the
ring. (a) What is the smallest value of N for which the second config-
uration is less energetic than the first? (b) For that value of N, con-
sider any one circumference electron—call it e0. How many other
circumference electrons are closer to e0 than the central electron is?

Sphere 1 with radius R1 has positive charge q. Sphere 2 with
radius 2.00R1 is far from sphere 1 and initially uncharged.After the
separated spheres are connected with a wire thin enough to retain
only negligible charge, (a) is potential V1 of sphere 1 greater than,
less than, or equal to potential V2 of sphere 2? What fraction of q
ends up on (b) sphere 1 and (c) sphere 2? (d) What is the ratio

Two metal spheres, each of radius 3.0 cm, have a
center-to-center separation of 2.0 m. Sphere 1 has charge 
1.0

ration is large enough for us to say that the charge on each sphere
is uniformly distributed (the spheres do not affect each other).
With V ! 0 at infinity, calculate (a) the potential at the point
halfway between the centers and the potential on the surface of
(b) sphere 1 and (c) sphere 2.
