(c)  DISPLACEMENT  OF  SPECTRAL  LINES  TOWARDS 
THE  RED 
In  Section  XXIII  it  has  been  shown  that  in  a  system  K' 
which  is  in  rotation  with  regard  to  a  Galileian  system  K, 
clocks  of  identical  construction,  and  which  are  con 
sidered  at  rest  with  respect  to  the  rotating  reference- 
body,  go  at  rates  which  are  dependent  on  the  positions 
of  the  clocks.  We  shall  now  examine  this  dependence 
quantitatively.  A  dock,  which  is  situated  at  a  distance 
r  from  the  centre  of  the  disc,  has  a  velocity  relative  to 
K  which  is  given  by 
where  w  represents  the  angular  velocity  of  rotation  of  the 
disc  K'  with  respect  to  K,  If  r0  represents  the  number 
of  ticks  of  the  clock  per  unit  time  ("  rate  "  of  the  clock) 
relative  to  K  when  the  clock  is  at  rest,  then  the  "  rate  " 
of  the  clock  (v)  when  it  is  moving  relative  to  K  with 
a  velocity  v,  but  at  rest  with  respect  to  the  disc,  will, 
in  accordance  with  Section  XII,  be  given  by
