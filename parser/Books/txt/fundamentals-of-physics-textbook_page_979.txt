Magnetism and Electrons
Magnetic materials, from lodestones to tattoos, are magnetic because of the elec-
trons within them.We have already seen one way in which electrons can generate
a magnetic field: Send them through a wire as an electric current, and their motion
produces a magnetic field around the wire.There are two more ways, each involving
a magnetic dipole moment that produces a magnetic field in the surrounding space.
However, their explanation requires quantum physics that is beyond the physics
presented in this book,and so here we shall only outline the results.
Spin Magnetic Dipole Moment
An electron has an intrinsic angular momentum called its spin angular momen-
tum (or just spin) 
; associated with this spin is an intrinsic spin magnetic
dipole moment
. (By intrinsic, we mean that 
and 
are basic characteristics
of an electron, like its mass and electric charge.) Vectors 
and 
are related by
(32-22)
in which e is the elementary charge (1.60 & 10'19 C) and m is the mass of an electron
(9.11 & 10'31 kg).The minus sign means that 
and are oppositely directed.
Spin 
is different from the angular momenta of Chapter 11 in two respects:
1. Spin 
itself cannot be measured. However, its component along any axis can
be measured.
2. A measured component of 
is quantized, which is a general term that means
it is restricted to certain values. A measured component of 
can have only
two values, which differ only in sign.
Let us assume that the component of spin 
is measured along the z axis of a
coordinate system. Then the measured component Sz can have only the two
values given by
,
(32-23)
where ms is called the spin magnetic quantum number and h (! 6.63 & 10'34 J(s)
is the Planck constant, the ubiquitous constant of quantum physics. The signs
given in Eq. 32-23 have to do with the direction of Sz along the z axis.When Sz is
parallel to the z axis, ms is 
and the electron is said to be spin up. When Sz is

32-5 MAGNETISM AND ELECTRONS
antiparallel to the z axis, ms is 
and the electron is said to be spin down.
The spin magnetic dipole moment 
of an electron also cannot be measured;
only its component along any axis can be measured, and that component too is
quantized, with two possible values of the same magnitude but different signs.We
can relate the component ms,z measured on the z axis to Sz by rewriting Eq. 32-22
in component form for the z axis as
Substituting for Sz from Eq. 32-23 then gives us
(32-24)
where the plus and minus signs correspond to ms,z being parallel and antiparallel
to the z axis, respectively.The quantity on the right is the Bohr magneton mB:
