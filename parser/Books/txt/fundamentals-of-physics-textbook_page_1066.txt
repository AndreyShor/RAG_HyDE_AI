from the center of the sphere, leav-
ing height h ! 3.0 cm. The paper-
weight is placed on a table and
viewed from directly above by an
observer who is distance d ! 8.0 cm
from the tabletop (Fig. 34-39). When
viewed through the paperweight,
how far away does the tabletop ap-
pear to be to the observer?
Module 34-4
Thin Lenses
•41
A lens is made of glass having an index of refraction of
1.5. One side of the lens is flat, and the other is convex with a
radius of curvature of 20 cm. (a) Find the focal length of the
lens. (b) If an object is placed 40 cm in front of the lens, where
is the image?
•42
Figure 34-40 gives the lateral
magnification m of an object versus
the object distance p from a lens as
the object is moved along the cen-
tral axis of the lens through a range
of values for p out to ps ! 20.0 cm.
What is the magnification of the ob-
ject when the object is 35 cm from
the lens?
•43
A movie camera with a (sin-
gle) lens of focal length 75 mm takes a picture of a person standing
27 m away. If the person is 180 cm tall, what is the height of the im-
age on the film?
•44
An object is placed against the
center of a thin lens and then moved
away from it along the central axis as
the image distance i is measured.
Figure 34-41 gives i versus object
distance p out to ps ! 60 cm. What is
the image distance when p ! 100
cm?
•45
You produce an image of the
Sun on a screen, using a thin lens whose focal length is 20.0 cm.
What is the diameter of the image? (See Appendix C for needed
data on the Sun.)
•46
An object is placed against the center of a thin lens and then
moved 70 cm from it along the central axis as the image distance i
is measured. Figure 34-42 gives i ver-
sus 
object 
distance 
p
out 
to 
ps ! 40 cm. What is the image dis-
tance when p ! 70 cm?
•47
A double-convex
lens is to be made of glass with an
index of refraction of 1.5. One sur-
face is to have twice the radius of
curvature of the other and the focal length is to be 60 mm.What is
the (a) smaller and (b) larger radius?
•48
An object is moved along the central axis of a thin lens while
the lateral magnification m is measured. Figure 34-43 gives m ver-
sus object distance p out to ps ! 8.0 cm. What is the magnification
of the object when the object is 14.0 cm from the lens?

An illuminated slide is held 44 cm from a screen. How
far from the slide must a lens of focal length 11 cm be placed (be-
tween the slide and the screen) to form an image of the slide’s pic-
ture on the screen?

53 Thin lenses. Object O stands
on the central axis of a thin symmetric lens. For this situation, each
problem in Table 34-6 gives object distance p (centimeters), the
type of lens (C stands for converging and D for diverging), and
then the distance (centimeters, without proper sign) between a
focal point and the lens. Find (a) the image distance i and (b) the
lateral magnification m of the object, including signs. Also, deter-
mine whether the image is (c) real (R) or virtual (V), (d) inverted
(I) from object O or noninverted (NI), and (e) on the same side of
the lens as object O or on the opposite side.
