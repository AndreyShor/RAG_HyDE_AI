Gauss’ Law
Gauss’ law relates the net flux & of an electric field through a closed surface
(a Gaussian surface) to the net charge qenc that is enclosed by that surface.It tells us that
´0& $ qenc
(Gauss’ law).

field produces negative (inward) flux. (e) Top face: the y component of the field
produces positive (outward) flux.

no contribution to the net flux through the closed surface.
23.12 Derive the expression for the magnitude of the electric
field of a charged particle by using Gauss’ law.
23.13 Identify that for a charged particle or uniformly charged
sphere, Gauss’ law is applied with a Gaussian surface that
is a concentric sphere.
●Gauss’ law relates the net flux & penetrating a closed sur-
face to the net charge qenc enclosed by the surface:
(Gauss’ law).

●Gauss’ law can also be written in terms of the electric field
piercing the enclosing Gaussian surface:

23.09 Apply Gauss’ law to relate the net flux & through a
closed surface to the net enclosed charge qenc.
23.10 Identify how the algebraic sign of the net enclosed
charge corresponds to the direction (inward or outward)
of the net flux through a Gaussian surface.

The y component of the
field pierces the surface
and gives outward flux.
The dot product is positive.
The x component of the
field skims the surface
and gives no flux. The
dot product is just zero.
