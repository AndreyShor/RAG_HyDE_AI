26-3 RESISTANCE AND RESISTIVITY
However, V/i is the resistance R, which allows us to recast Eq. 26-15 as
(26-16)
Equation 26-16 can be applied only to a homogeneous isotropic conductor of
uniform cross section, with the potential difference applied as in Fig. 26-8b.
The macroscopic quantities V, i, and R are of greatest interest when we are
making electrical measurements on specific conductors. They are the quantities
that we read directly on meters.We turn to the microscopic quantities E, J, and r
when we are interested in the fundamental electrical properties of materials.

The figure here shows three cylindrical copper conductors along with their face areas
and lengths. Rank them according to the current through them, greatest first, when
the same potential difference V is placed across their lengths.

Variation with Temperature
The values of most physical properties vary with temperature, and resistivity is no
exception. Figure 26-10, for example, shows the variation of this property for
copper over a wide temperature range. The relation between temperature and
resistivity for copper—and for metals in general—is fairly linear over a rather
broad temperature range. For such linear relations we can write an empirical
approximation that is good enough for most engineering purposes:
r # r0 ! r0a(T #T0).
(26-17)
Here T0 is a selected reference temperature and r0 is the resistivity at that temper-
ature. Usually T0 ! 293 K (room temperature), for which r0 ! 1.69 $ 10#8 0&m
for copper.
Because temperature enters Eq. 26-17 only as a difference, it does not matter
whether you use the Celsius or Kelvin scale in that equation because the sizes of
degrees on these scales are identical. The quantity a in Eq. 26-17, called the
temperature coefficient of resistivity, is chosen so that the equation gives good
agreement with experiment for temperatures in the chosen range. Some values of
a for metals are listed in Table 26-1.
