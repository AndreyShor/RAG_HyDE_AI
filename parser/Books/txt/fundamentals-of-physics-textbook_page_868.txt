CHAPTER 29
MAGNETIC FIELDS DUE TO CURRENTS
Additional examples, video, and practice available at WileyPLUS
We want to combine 
and 
to find their vector sum,
which is the net field 
at P.To find the directions of 
and
, we apply the right-hand rule of Fig. 29-5 to each current
in Fig. 29-9a. For wire 1, with current out of the page, we
mentally grasp the wire with the right hand, with the thumb
pointing out of the page. Then the curled fingers indicate
that the field lines run counterclockwise. In particular, in the
region of point P, they are directed upward to the left.
Recall that the magnetic field at a point near a long, straight
current-carrying wire must be directed perpendicular to a
radial line between the point and the current.Thus,
must
be directed upward to the left as drawn in Fig. 29-9b. (Note
carefully the perpendicular symbol between vector 
and
the line connecting point P and wire 1.)
Repeating this analysis for the current in wire 2, we find
that 
is directed upward to the right as drawn in Fig. 29-9b.
Adding the vectors: We can now vectorially add 
and 
to find the net magnetic field 
at point P, either by using a
vector-capable calculator or by resolving the vectors into
components and then combining the components of

However, in Fig. 29-9b, there is a third method: Because 
and 
are perpendicular to each other, they form the legs
of a right triangle, with 
as the hypotenuse. So,
(Answer)
The angle f between the directions of 
and 
in Fig. 29-9b
follows from
which, with B1 and B2 as given above, yields
The angle between

29-2 FORCE BETWEEN TWO PARALLEL CURRENTS
Learning Objectives
29.11 Identify that parallel currents attract each other, and an-
tiparallel currents repel each other.
29.12 Describe how a rail gun works.
●Parallel wires carrying currents in the same direction attract
each other, whereas parallel wires carrying currents in oppo-
site directions repel each other. The magnitude of the force
on a length L of either wire is
After reading this module, you should be able to . . . 
29.10 Given two parallel or antiparallel currents, find the
magnetic field of the first current at the location of the
second current and then find the force acting on that
second current.
Key Ideas
Force Between Two Parallel Currents
Two long parallel wires carrying currents exert forces on each other. Figure 29-10
shows two such wires, separated by a distance d and carrying currents ia and ib.
Let us analyze the forces on these wires due to each other.
We seek first the force on wire b in Fig. 29-10 due to the current in wire a.
That current produces a magnetic field 
and it is this magnetic field that actu-
ally causes the force we seek.To find the force, then, we need the magnitude and
direction of the field 
at the site of wire b.The magnitude of 
at every point of
wire b is, from Eq. 29-4,
