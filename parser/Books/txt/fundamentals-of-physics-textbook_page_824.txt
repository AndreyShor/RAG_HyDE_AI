In Fig. 27-52, an array of n par-
allel resistors is connected in series to
a resistor and an ideal battery. All the
resistors have the same resistance. If
an identical resistor were added in
parallel to the parallel array, the cur-
rent through the battery would
change by 1.25%. What is the value
of n?

You are given a number of 10 0 resistors, each capable of

or in parallel to make a 10 0 resist-
ance that is capable of dissipating at

The Ammeter and
the Voltmeter

(a) In Fig. 27-56, what cur-
rent does the ammeter read if 
5.0 V (ideal battery), R1 ! 2.0 0, R2 !
4.0 0, and R3 ! 6.0 0? (b) The am-
meter and battery are now inter-
changed. Show that the ammeter
reading is unchanged.

In Fig. 27-57, R1

ammeter resistance is zero, and the
battery is ideal. What multiple of #/R
gives the current in the ammeter?

In Fig. 27-58, a voltmeter of
resistance RV ! 300 0 and an am-
meter of resistance RA ! 3.00 0 are
being used to measure a resistance
R in a circuit that also contains a re-
sistance R0 ! 100 0 and an ideal
battery with an emf of # ! 12.0 V.
Resistance R is given by R ! V/i,
where V is the potential across R
and i is the ammeter reading. The
voltmeter reading is V-, which is
V
plus the potential difference
across the ammeter. Thus, the ratio
of the two meter readings is not R but only an apparent resist-
ance R- ! V-/i. If R ! 85.0 0, what are (a) the ammeter reading,
(b) the voltmeter reading, and (c) R-? (d) If RA is decreased,
does the difference between R- and R increase, decrease, or
remain the same?
