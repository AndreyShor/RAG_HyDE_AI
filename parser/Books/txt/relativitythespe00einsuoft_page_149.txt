dependent  on  the  potential  of  the  gravitational  field  in 
which  it  is  situated. 
-y  The  frequency  ot  an  atom  situated  on  the  surface  of  a 
heavenly  body  will  be  somewhat  less  than  the  frequency 
of  an  atom  of  the  same  element  which  is  situated  in  free 
space  (or  on  the  surface  of  a  smaller  celestial  body). 
M 
Now  <Â£=  -K-,   where   K   is    Newton's   constant   of 
gravitation,  and  M  is  the  mass  of  the  heavenly  body. 
Thus  a  displacement  towards  the  red  ought  to  take  place 
for  spectral  lines  produced  at  the  surface  of  stars  as 
compared  with  the  spectral  lines  of  the  same  element 
produced  at  the  surface  of  the  earth,  the  amount  of  this 
displacement  being 
For  the  sun,  the  displacement  towards  the  red  pre 
dicted  by  theory  amounts  to  about  two  millionths  of 
the  wave-length.  A  trustworthy  calculation  is  not 
possible  in  the  case  of  the  stars,  because  in  general 
neither  the  mass  M  nor  the  radius  r  is  known. 
It  is  an  open  question  whether  or  not  this  effect 
exists,  and  at  the  present  time  astronomers  are  working 
with  great  zeal  towards  the  solution.  Owing  to  the 
smallness  of  the  effect  in  the  case  of  the  sun,  it  is  diffi 
cult  to  form  an  opinion  as  to  its  existence.  Whereas 
Grebe  and  Bachem  (Bonn),  as  a  result  of  their  own 
measurements  and  those  of  Evershed  and  Schwarzschild 
on  the  cyanogen  bands,  have  placed  the  existence  of 
the  effect  almost  beyond  doubt,  other  investigators, 
particularly  St.  John,  have  been  led  to  the  opposite 
opinion  in  consequence  of  their  measurements.
