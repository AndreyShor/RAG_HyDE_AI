CHAPTER 30
INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE
Mutual Induction
In this section we return to the case of two interacting coils, which we first dis-
cussed in Module 30-1, and we treat it in a somewhat more formal manner. We
saw earlier that if two coils are close together as in Fig. 30-2, a steady current i in
one coil will set up a magnetic flux 0 through the other coil (linking the other
coil). If we change i with time, an emf # given by Faraday’s law appears in the sec-
ond coil; we called this process induction. We could better have called it mutual
induction, to suggest the mutual interaction of the two coils and to distinguish it
from self-induction, in which only one coil is involved.
Let us look a little more quantitatively at mutual induction. Figure 30-19a
shows two circular close-packed coils near each other and sharing a common
central axis.With the variable resistor set at a particular resistance R, the battery
produces a steady current i1 in coil 1. This current creates a magnetic field repre-
sented by the lines of 
in the figure. Coil 2 is connected to a sensitive meter but
contains no battery; a magnetic flux 021 (the flux through coil 2 associated with
the current in coil 1) links the N2 turns of coil 2.
We define the mutual inductance M21 of coil 2 with respect to coil 1 as

After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
30.39 Describe the mutual induction of two coils and sketch
the arrangement.
30.40 Calculate the mutual inductance of one coil with respect
to a second coil (or some second current that is changing).
30.41 Calculate the emf induced in one coil by a second coil
in terms of the mutual inductance and the rate of change
of the current in the second coil.
