Figure 10-25b shows an overhead view of a horizontal bar that
is rotated about the pivot point by two horizontal forces,
and

with 
at angle f to the bar. Rank the following values of f accord-
ing to the magnitude of the angular acceleration of the bar, greatest
first:90#,70#,and 110#.

Figure 10-26 shows a uniform metal plate
that had been square before 25% of it was
snipped off. Three lettered points are indicated.
Rank them according to the rotational inertia of
the plate around a perpendicular axis through
them, greatest first.

In the overhead view of Fig. 10-24,
five forces of the same magnitude act
on a strange merry-go-round; it is a
square that can rotate about point P, at
midlength along one of the edges.
Rank the forces according to the mag-
nitude of the torque they create about
point P,greatest first.

Figure 10-20 is a graph of the an-
gular velocity versus time for a disk
rotating like a merry-go-round. For a
point on the disk rim, rank the in-
stants a, b, c, and d according to the
magnitude of the (a) tangential and
(b) radial acceleration, greatest first.

Figure 10-21 shows plots of angu-
lar position u versus time t for three
cases in which a disk is rotated like a
merry-go-round. In each case, the ro-
tation direction changes at a certain
angular position uchange. (a) For each
case,
determine whether uchange is
clockwise or counterclockwise from
u ! 0, or whether it is at u ! 0. For
each case, determine (b) whether 
v is zero before, after, or at t ! 0
and (c) whether a is positive,negative,or zero.

A force is applied to the rim of a disk that can rotate like
a merry-go-round, so as to change its angular velocity. Its initial
and final angular velocities, respectively, for four situations are:
(a) %2 rad/s, 5 rad/s; (b) 2 rad/s, 5 rad/s; (c) %2 rad/s, %5 rad/s; and
(d) 2 rad/s, %5 rad/s. Rank the situations according to the work
done by the torque due to the force, greatest first.

Figure 10-22b is a graph of the angular position of the rotating
disk of Fig. 10-22a. Is the angular velocity of the disk positive, nega-
tive, or zero at (a) t ! 1 s, (b) t ! 2 s, and (c) t ! 3 s? (d) Is the an-
gular acceleration positive or negative?

The SI unit of torque is the newton-meter (N)m). A torque t
is positive if it tends to rotate a body at rest counterclockwise and
negative if it tends to rotate the body clockwise.
Newton’s Second Law in Angular Form
The rotational
analog of Newton’s second law is
tnet ! Ia,
(10-45)
where tnet is the net torque acting on a particle or rigid body,I is the ro-
tational inertia of the particle or body about the rotation axis, and a is
the resulting angular acceleration about that axis.
Work and Rotational Kinetic Energy
The equations used
for calculating work and power in rotational motion correspond to
equations used for translational motion and are
(10-53)
and
(10-55)
When t is constant, Eq. 10-53 reduces to
W ! t(uf % ui).
