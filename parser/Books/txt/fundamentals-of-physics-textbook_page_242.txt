of mass is still the same distance from each particle. The com is a property of the
physical particles, not the coordinate system we happen to use.
We can rewrite Eq. 9-2 as
(9-3)
in which M is the total mass of the system. (Here, M ! m1 & m2.)
Many Particles. We can extend this equation to a more general situation in
which n particles are strung out along the x axis.Then the total mass is M ! m1 &
m2 &
& mn, and the location of the center of mass is
(9-4)
The subscript i is an index that takes on all integer values from 1 to n.
Three Dimensions. If the particles are distributed in three dimensions, the cen-
ter of mass must be identified by three coordinates.By extension of Eq.9-4,they are
(9-5)
We can also define the center of mass with the language of vectors. First
recall that the position of a particle at coordinates xi, yi, and zi is given by a posi-
tion vector (it points from the origin to the particle):
(9-6)
Here the index identifies the particle, and iˆ, ˆj, and ˆk are unit vectors pointing,
respectively, in the positive direction of the x, y, and z axes. Similarly, the position
of the center of mass of a system of particles is given by a position vector:
(9-7)
If you are a fan of concise notation, the three scalar equations of Eq. 9-5 can now
be replaced by a single vector equation,
(9-8)
where again M is the total mass of the system. You can check that this equation
is correct by substituting Eqs. 9-6 and 9-7 into it, and then separating out the x,
y, and z components.The scalar relations of Eq. 9-5 result.
Solid Bodies
An ordinary object, such as a baseball bat, contains so many particles (atoms)
that we can best treat it as a continuous distribution of matter. The “particles”
then become differential mass elements dm, the sums of Eq. 9-5 become inte-
grals, and the coordinates of the center of mass are defined as
(9-9)
where M is now the mass of the object.The integrals effectively allow us to use Eq.
9-5 for a huge number of particles, an effort that otherwise would take many years.
Evaluating these integrals for most common objects (such as a television set or
a moose) would be difficult, so here we consider only uniform objects. Such objects
have uniform density, or mass per unit volume; that is, the density r (Greek letter
