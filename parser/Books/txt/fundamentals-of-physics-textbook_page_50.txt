x " x0 # vavgt,
(2-12)
in which x0 is the position of the particle at t " 0 and vavg is the average velocity
between t " 0 and a later time t.
For the linear velocity function in Eq. 2-11, the average velocity over any time
interval (say, from t " 0 to a later time t) is the average of the velocity at the be-
ginning of the interval (" v0) and the velocity at the end of the interval (" v). For
the interval from t " 0 to the later time t then, the average velocity is
(2-13)
Substituting the right side of Eq. 2-11 for v yields, after a little rearrangement,
(2-14)
Finally, substituting Eq. 2-14 into Eq. 2-12 yields
(2-15)
As a check, note that putting t " 0 yields x " x0, as it must. As a further check,
taking the derivative of Eq. 2-15 yields Eq. 2-11, again as it must. Figure 2-9a
shows a plot of Eq. 2-15; the function is quadratic and thus the plot is curved.
Three Other Equations. Equations 2-11 and 2-15 are the basic equations for
constant acceleration; they can be used to solve any constant acceleration prob-
lem in this book. However, we can derive other equations that might prove useful
in certain specific situations. First, note that as many as five quantities can possi-
bly be involved in any problem about constant acceleration—namely, x $ x0, v, t,
a, and v0. Usually, one of these quantities is not involved in the problem, either as
a given or as an unknown. We are then presented with three of the remaining
quantities and asked to find the fourth.
Equations 2-11 and 2-15 each contain four of these quantities, but not the
same four. In Eq. 2-11, the “missing ingredient” is the displacement x $ x0. In Eq.
2-15, it is the velocity v. These two equations can also be combined in three ways
to yield three additional equations, each of which involves a different “missing
variable.” First, we can eliminate t to obtain
(2-16)
This equation is useful if we do not know t and are not required to find it. Second,
we can eliminate the acceleration a between Eqs. 2-11 and 2-15 to produce an
equation in which a does not appear:
(2-17)
Finally, we can eliminate v0, obtaining
(2-18)
Note the subtle difference between this equation and Eq. 2-15. One involves the
initial velocity v0; the other involves the velocity v at time t.
Table 2-1 lists the basic constant acceleration equations (Eqs. 2-11 and 2-15) as
well as the specialized equations that we have derived.To solve a simple constant ac-
celeration problem, you can usually use an equation from this list (if you have the
list with you). Choose an equation for which the only unknown variable is the vari-
able requested in the problem.A simpler plan is to remember only Eqs. 2-11 and
2-15,and then solve them as simultaneous equations whenever needed.
