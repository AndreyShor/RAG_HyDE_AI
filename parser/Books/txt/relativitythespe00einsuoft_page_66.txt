48    SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
Let  me  add  a  final  remark  of  a  fundamental  nature. 
The  success  of  the  Faraday-Maxwell  interpretation  of 
electromagnetic  action  at  a  distance  resulted  in  physicists 
becoming  convinced  that  there  are  no  such  things  as 
instantaneous  actions  at  a  distance  (not  involving  an 
intermediary  medium)  of  the  type  of  Newton's  law  of 
gravitation.  According  to  the  theory  of  relativity, 
action  at  a  distance  with  the  velocity  of  light  always 
takes  the  place  of  instantaneous  action  at  a  distance  or 
of  action  at  a  distance  with  an  infinite  velocity  of  trans 
mission.  This  is  connected  with  the  fact  that  the 
velocity  c  plays  a  fundamental  role  in  this  theory.  In 
Part  II  we  shall  see  in  what  way  this  result  becomes 
modified  in  the  general  theory  of  relativity.
