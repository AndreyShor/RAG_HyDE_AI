carbon target should oscillate sinusoidally due to the oscillating electric force on
it from the wave’s electric field. Further, the electron should oscillate at the same
frequency as the wave and should send out waves at this same frequency, as if it
were a tiny transmitting antenna. Thus, the x rays scattered by the electron should
have the same frequency, and the same wavelength, as the x rays in the incident
beam—but they don’t.
Compton interpreted the scattering of x rays from carbon in terms of energy
and momentum transfers, via photons, between the incident x-ray beam and
loosely bound electrons in the carbon target. Let’s see how this quantum physics
interpretation leads to an understanding of Compton’s results.
Suppose a single photon (of energy E ! hf ) is associated with the interac-
tion between the incident x-ray beam and a stationary electron. In general, the
direction of travel of the x ray will change (the x ray is scattered), and the elec-
tron will recoil, which means that the electron has obtained some kinetic energy.
Energy is conserved in this isolated interaction.Thus, the energy of the scattered
photon (E* ! hf*) must be less than that of the incident photon. The scattered x
rays must then have a lower frequency f* and thus a longer wavelength l* than
the incident x rays, just as Compton’s experimental results in Fig. 38-4 show.
For the quantitative part, we first apply the law of conservation of energy.
Figure 38-5 suggests a “collision” between an x ray and an initially stationary free
electron in the target.As a result of the collision, an x ray of wavelength l* moves
off at an angle f and the electron moves off at an angle u, as shown. Conservation
of energy then gives us
hf ! hf* & K,
in which hf is the energy of the incident x-ray photon, hf* is the energy of the
scattered x-ray photon, and K is the kinetic energy of the recoiling electron.
Because the electron may recoil with a speed comparable to that of light, we must
use the relativistic expression of Eq. 37-52,
K ! mc2(g # 1),
