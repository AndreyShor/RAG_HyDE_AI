In Fig. 17-38, sound with a
40.0 cm wavelength travels right-
ward from a source and through a
tube that consists of a straight por-
tion and a half-circle. Part of the
sound wave travels through the half-
circle and then rejoins the rest of the
wave, which goes directly through
the straight portion. This rejoining
results in interference. What is the
smallest radius r that results in an in-
tensity minimum at the detector?

Figure 17-36 shows four isotropic point sources of sound
that are uniformly spaced on an x axis. The sources emit sound at
the same wavelength l and same amplitude sm, and they emit in
phase. A point P is shown on the x axis. Assume that as the sound
waves travel to P, the decrease in their amplitude is negligible.

series of pulses, one from each terrace; the parade of pulses
sounds like a played note. (a) Assuming that all the rays in
Fig. 17-33 are horizontal, find the frequency at which the pulses
return (that is, the frequency of the perceived note). (b) If the
width w of the terraces were smaller, would the frequency be

frequency, 540 Hz, travel in the same direction at 330 m/s. The

Two loud speakers are located 3.35 m apart on an
outdoor stage. A listener is 18.3 m from one and 19.5 m from the
other. During the sound check, a signal generator drives the two
speakers in phase with the same amplitude and frequency.
The transmitted frequency is swept through the audible range
(20 Hz to 20 kHz). (a) What is the lowest frequency fmin,1 that gives
minimum signal (destructive interference) at the listener’s loca-
tion? By what number must fmin,1 be multiplied to get (b) the sec-
ond lowest frequency fmin,2 that gives minimum signal and (c) the
third lowest frequency fmin,3 that gives minimum signal? (d) What is
the lowest frequency fmax,1 that gives maximum signal (constructive
interference) at the listener’s location? By what number must fmax,1
be multiplied to get (e) the second lowest frequency fmax,2 that
gives maximum signal and (f) the third lowest frequency fmax,3 that
gives maximum signal?

In Fig. 17-34, sound waves A
and B, both of wavelength l, are ini-
tially in phase and traveling right-
ward, as indicated by the two rays.
Wave A is reflected from four sur-
faces but ends up traveling in its orig-
inal direction.Wave B ends in that di-
rection after reflecting from two
surfaces. Let distance L in the figure
