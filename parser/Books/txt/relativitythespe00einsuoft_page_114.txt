96  GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
continuum  by  means  of  Gauss  co-ordinates  completely 
replaces  the  description  with  the  aid  of  a  body  of  re 
ference,  without  suffering  from  the  defects  of  the  latter 
'mode  of  description  ;  it  is  not  tied  down  to  the  Euclidean 
character  of  the  continuum  which  has  to  be  represented.
