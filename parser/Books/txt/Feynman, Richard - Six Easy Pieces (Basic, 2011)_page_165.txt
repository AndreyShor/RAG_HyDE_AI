summary more simply if we ﬁrst deﬁne an “ideal experiment” as
one in which there are no uncertain external inﬂuences, i.e., no jig-
gling or other things going on that we cannot take into account.
We would be quite precise if we said: “An ideal experiment is one
in which all of the initial and ﬁnal conditions of the experiment
are completely speciﬁed.” What we will call “an event” is, in general,
just a speciﬁc set of initial and ﬁnal conditions. (For example: “An
electron leaves the gun, arrives at the detector, and nothing else
happens.”) Now for our summary.
Summary
(1) The probability of an event in an ideal experiment is given
by the square of the absolute value of a complex number f
which is called the probability amplitude.
P = probability,
f = probability amplitude,
(6.6)
P = |f|2.
(2) When an event can occur in several alternative ways, the
probability amplitude for the event is the sum of the proba-
bility amplitudes for each way considered separately. There is
interference.
f = f1 + f2,
P = |f1 + f2|2.
(6.7)
(3) If an experiment is performed which is capable of determin-
ing whether one or another alternative is actually taken, the
probability of the event is the sum of the probabilities for each
alternative. The interference is lost.
P = P1 + P2.
