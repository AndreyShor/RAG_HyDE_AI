CHAPTER 17
WAVES—II
17-6 BEATS
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
17.28 Explain how beats are produced.
17.29 Add the displacement equations for two sound
waves of the same amplitude and slightly different angu-
lar frequencies to find the displacement equation of the
resultant wave and identify the time-varying amplitude.
17.30 Apply the relationship between the beat frequency
and the frequencies of two sound waves that have the
same amplitude when the frequencies (or, equivalently,
the angular frequencies) differ by a small amount.
Learning Objectives
●Beats arise when two waves having slightly different frequencies, f1 and f2, are detected together. The beat frequency is
fbeat # f 1 $ f 2.

Figure 17-17 Harmonic frequencies of four pipes.
17-41 gives the harmonic frequencies in a pipe with only
one open end (an asymmetric pipe) as f # nv/4L, for n #
1, 3, 5, . . . , that is, for only odd positive integers.
Pipe A: Let’s first find the resonant frequencies of symmet-
ric pipe A (with two open ends) by evaluating Eq. 17-39:
# nA(500 Hz) # nA(0.50 kHz),
for nA # 1, 2, 3, . . . .
The first six harmonic frequencies are shown in the top plot
in Fig. 17-17.
Pipe B: Next let’s find the resonant frequencies of asym-
metric pipe B (with only one open end) by evaluating Eq.
17-41, being careful to use only odd integers for the har-
monic numbers:
# nB(500 Hz) # nB(0.500 kHz),
for nB # 1, 3, 5, . . . .
Comparing our two results, we see that we get a match for
each choice of nB:
fA = fB
for nA # nB
with nB # 1, 3, 5, . . . .
(Answer)
For example, as shown in Fig. 17-17, if we set up the fifth
harmonic in pipe B and bring the pipe close to pipe A, the
fifth harmonic will then be set up in pipe A. However, no
harmonic in B can set up an even harmonic in A.
Pipe C: Let’s continue with pipe C (with only one end) by
writing Eq. 17-41 as
fB # nBv
4LB
#
nBv
4(0.500LA) # nB(343 m/s)
2(0.343 m)
fA # nAv
2LA
# nA(343 m/s)
2(0.343 m)
# nC (1000 Hz) # nC (1.00 kHz),
for nC # 1, 3, 5, . . . .
From this we see that C can excite some of the harmonics of
A but only those with harmonic numbers nA that are twice
an odd integer:
fA # fC
for nA # 2nC,
with nC # 1, 3, 5, . . . .
(Answer)
Pipe D: Finally, let’s check D with our same procedure:
# nD (125 Hz) # nD (0.125 kHz),
for nD # 1, 3, 5, . . . .
As shown in Fig. 17-17, none of these frequencies match a
harmonic frequency of A. (Can you see that we would get a
match if nD # 4nA? But that is impossible because 4nA can-
not yield an odd integer, as required of nD.) Thus D cannot
set up a standing wave in A.
