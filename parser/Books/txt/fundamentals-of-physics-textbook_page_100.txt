Sample Problem 4.04 Projectile dropped from airplane
Then Eq. 4-27 gives us
(Answer)
(b) As the capsule reaches the water, what is its velocity 
?
KEY IDEAS
(1) The horizontal and vertical components of the capsule’s
velocity are independent. (2) Component vx does not change
from its initial value v0x " v0 cos u0 because there is no hori-
zontal acceleration. (3) Component vy changes from its initial
value v0y " v0 sinu0 because there is a vertical acceleration.
Calculations: When the capsule reaches the water,
vx " v0 cos u0 " (55.0 m/s)(cos 0°) " 55.0 m/s.
Using Eq. 4-23 and the capsule’s time of fall t " 10.1 s, we
also find that when the capsule reaches the water,
vy " v0 sin u0 $ gt
" (55.0 m/s)(sin 0°) $ (9.8 m/s2)(10.1 s)
" $99.0 m/s.

In Fig. 4-14, a rescue plane flies at 198 km/h (" 55.0 m/s) and
constant height h " 500 m toward a point directly over a
victim, where a rescue capsule is to land.
(a) What should be the angle f of the pilot’s line of sight to
the victim when the capsule release is made?
KEY IDEAS
Once released, the capsule is a projectile, so its horizontal
and vertical motions can be considered separately (we need
not consider the actual curved path of the capsule).
Calculations: In Fig. 4-14, we see that f is given by
(4-27)
where x is the horizontal coordinate of the victim (and of
the capsule when it hits the water) and h " 500 m. We
should be able to find x with Eq. 4-21:
x $ x0 " (v0 cos u0)t.
(4-28)
Here we know that x0 " 0 because the origin is placed at
the point of release. Because the capsule is released and
not shot from the plane, its initial velocity 
is equal to
the plane’s velocity. Thus, we know also that the initial ve-
locity has magnitude v0 " 55.0 m/s and angle u0 " 0°
(measured relative to the positive direction of the x axis).
However, we do not know the time t the capsule takes to
move from the plane to the victim.
To find t, we next consider the vertical motion and
specifically Eq. 4-22:
(4-29)
Here the vertical displacement y $ y0 of the capsule is 
$500 m (the negative value indicates that the capsule
moves downward). So,
(4-30)
Solving for t, we find t " 10.1 s. Using that value in Eq. 4-28
yields
x $ 0 " (55.0 m/s)(cos 0°)(10.1 s),
(4-31)
or
x " 555.5 m.

Figure 4-14 A plane drops a rescue capsule while moving at
constant velocity in level flight. While falling, the capsule 
remains under the plane.
Checkpoint 4
A fly ball is hit to the outfield. During its flight (ignore the effects of the air), what
happens to its (a) horizontal and (b) vertical components of velocity? What are the (c)
horizontal and (d) vertical components of its acceleration during ascent, during de-
scent, and at the topmost point of its flight?
