second. If we increase the frequency to 500 or 1000 kilocycles (1
kilocycle = 1000 cycles) per second, we are “on the air,” for this is
the frequency range which is used for radio broadcasts. (Of course
it has nothing to do with the air! We can have radio broadcasts
without any air.) If we again increase the frequency, we come into
the range that is used for FM and TV. Going still further, we use
certain short waves, for example for radar. Still higher, and we do
not need an instrument to “see” the stuff, we can see it with the
human eye. In the range of frequency from 5 ¥ 1014 to 1015 cycles
per second our eyes would see the oscillation of the charged comb,
if we could shake it that fast, as red, blue, or violet light, depending
on the frequency. Frequencies below this range are called infrared,
and above it, ultraviolet. The fact that we can see in a particular
frequency range makes that part of the electromagnetic spectrum
no more impressive than the other parts from a physicist’s stand-
point, but from a human standpoint, of course, it is more interest-
ing. If we go up even higher in frequency, we get x-rays. X-rays are
nothing but very high-frequency light. If we go still higher, we get
gamma rays. These two terms, x-rays and gamma rays, are used al-
