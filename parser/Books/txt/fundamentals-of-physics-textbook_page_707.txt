Figure 23-46a shows three plastic sheets that are large, paral-
lel, and uniformly charged. Figure 23-46b gives the component of the
net electric field along an x axis through the sheets. The scale of the
vertical axis is set by Es$6.0(105 N/C.What is the ratio of the charge
density on sheet 3 to that on sheet 2?
ducting and thin and have uniform surface charge densities on
their outer surfaces. Figure 23-41b gives the radial component E of
the electric field versus radial distance r from the common axis,
and Es $ 3.0(103 N/C.What is the shell’s linear charge density?

A long, straight wire has fixed negative charge with a lin-
ear charge density of magnitude 3.6 nC/m. The wire is to be en-
closed by a coaxial, thin-walled nonconducting cylindrical shell of
radius 1.5 cm.The shell is to have positive charge on its outside sur-
face with a surface charge density s that makes the net external
electric field zero. Calculate s.

A charge of uniform linear density 2.0 nC/m is distributed
along a long, thin, nonconducting rod.The rod is coaxial with a long
conducting cylindrical shell (inner radius $ 5.0 cm, outer radius $
10 cm). The net charge on the shell is zero. (a) What is the magni-
tude of the electric field 15 cm from the axis of the shell? What is
the surface charge density on the (b) inner and (c) outer surface of
the shell?

magnitude 7.00 ( 10'22 C/m2. In unit-vector notation, what is the
electric field at points (a) to the left of the plates, (b) to the right of
them,and (c) between them?

In Fig. 23-45, a small circular hole of radius R $ 1.80 cm has
been cut in the middle of an infinite, flat, nonconducting surface
that has uniform charge density s $ 4.50 pC/m2. A z axis, with its
origin at the hole’s center, is perpendicular to the surface. In unit-
vector notation, what is the electric field at point P at z $ 2.56 cm?
(Hint: See Eq. 22-26 and use superposition.)

negligible thickness has a total charge of 6.0 ( 10'6 C. (a) Estimate
the magnitude E of the electric field just off the center of the plate (at,
say, a distance of 0.50 mm from the center) by assuming that the
charge is spread uniformly over the two faces of the plate. (b)
Estimate E at a distance of 30 m (large relative to the plate size) by as-
suming that the plate is a charged particle.
