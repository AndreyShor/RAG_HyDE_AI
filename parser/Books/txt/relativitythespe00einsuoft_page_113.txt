SPACE-TIME  CONTINUUM  95 
corresponding  to  the  material  point,  we  thus  have  a 
(uni-dimensional)  line  in  the  four-dimensional  continuum. 
In  the  same  way,  any  such  lines  in  our  continuum 
correspond  to  many  points  in  motion.  The  only  state 
ments  having  regard  to  these  points  which  can  claim 
a  physical  existence  are  in  reality  the  statements  about 
their  encounters.  In  our  mathematical  treatment, 
such  an  encounter  is  expressed  in  the  fact  that  the  two 
lines  which  represent  the  motions  of  the  points  in 
question  have  a  particular  system  of  co-ordinate  values, 
xi>  xz>  X3>  Xv  m  common.  After  mature  consideration 
the  reader  will  doubtless  admit  that  in  reality  such 
encounters  constitute  the  only  actual  evidence  of  a 
time-space  nature  with  which  we  meet  in  physical 
statements. 
When  we  were  describing  the  motion  of  a  material 
point  relative  to  a  body  of  reference,  we  stated 
nothing  more  than  the  encounters  of  this  point  with 
particular  points  of  the  reference-body.  We  can  also 
determine  the  corresponding  values  of  the  time  by  the 
observation  of  encounters  of  the  body  with  clocks,  in 
conjunction  with  the  observation  of  the  encounter  of  the 
hands  of  clocks  with  particular  points  on  the  dials. 
It  is  just  the  same  in  the  case  of  space-measurements  by 
means  of  measuring-rods,  as  a  little  consideration  will 
show. 
The  following  statements  hold  generally :  Every 
physical  description  resolves  itself  into  a  number  of 
statements,  each  of  which  refers  to  the  space-time 
coincidence  of  two  events  A  and  B.  In  terms  of 
Gaussian  co-ordinates,  every  such  statement  is  expressed 
by  the  agreement  of  their  four  co-ordinates  xlt  x2,  x3, 
%4.  Thus  in  reality,  the  description  of  the  time-space
