protein? This is the central unsolved problem in biology today. The
ﬁrst clues, or pieces of information, however, are these: There are
in the cell tiny particles called ribosomes, and it is now known that
that is the place where proteins are made. But the ribosomes are
not in the nucleus, where the DNA and its instructions are. Some-
thing seems to be the matter. However, it is also known that little
molecule pieces come off the DNA—not as long as the big DNA
molecule that carries all the information itself, but like a small sec-
tion of it. This is called RNA, but that is not essential. It is a kind
of copy of the DNA, a short copy. The RNA, which somehow car-
