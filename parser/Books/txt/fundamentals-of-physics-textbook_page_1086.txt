Coherent Source. A laser differs from common light sources in that its
atoms emit light in a cooperative manner, thereby making the light coherent.
Moreover, the light is almost monochromatic, is emitted in a thin beam with
little spreading, and can be focused to a width that almost matches the wave-
length of the light.
Intensity in Double-Slit Interference
Equations 35-14 and 35-16 tell us how to locate the maxima and minima of
the double-slit interference pattern on screen C of Fig. 35-10 as a function of the
angle u in that figure. Here we wish to derive an expression for the intensity I of
the fringes as a function of u.
The light leaving the slits is in phase. However, let us assume that the light
waves from the two slits are not in phase when they arrive at point P. Instead,
the electric field components of those waves at point P are not in phase and
vary with time as
E1 ! E0 sin vt
(35-20)
and
E2 ! E0 sin(vt ' f),
(35-21)
where v is the angular frequency of the waves and f is the phase constant of
wave E2. Note that the two waves have the same amplitude E0 and a phase differ-
ence of f. Because that phase difference does not vary, the waves are coherent.
We shall show that these two waves will combine at P to produce an intensity I
given by
(35-22)
and that
(35-23)
In Eq. 35-22, I0 is the intensity of the light that arrives on the screen from one
slit when the other slit is temporarily covered.We assume that the slits are so nar-
row in comparison to the wavelength that this single-slit intensity is essentially
uniform over the region of the screen in which we wish to examine the fringes.
Equations 35-22 and 35-23, which together tell us how the intensity I of the
fringe pattern varies with the angle u in Fig. 35-10, necessarily contain informa-
tion about the location of the maxima and minima. Let us see if we can extract
that information to find equations about those locations.
Maxima. Study of Eq. 35-22 shows that intensity maxima will occur when
(35-24)
If we put this result into Eq. 35-23, we find

for m ! 0, 1, 2, . . .
(maxima),
(35-25)
which is exactly Eq. 35-14, the expression that we derived earlier for the locations
of the maxima.
Minima. The minima in the fringe pattern occur when

If we combine this relation with Eq. 35-23, we are led at once to
