43-4 THERMONUCLEAR FUSION: THE BASIC PROCESS
Figure 43-10 sums things up. The curve marked n(K) in this figure is a
Maxwell distribution curve for the protons in the Sun’s core, drawn to correspond
to the Sun’s central temperature.This curve differs from the Maxwell distribution
curve given in Fig. 19-8 in that here the curve is drawn in terms of energy and not
of speed. Specifically, for any kinetic energy K, the expression n(K) dK gives the
probability that a proton will have a kinetic energy lying between the values K and
K ' dK. The value of kT in the core of the Sun is indicated by the vertical line in
the figure; note that many of the Sun’s core protons have energies greater than
this value.
The curve marked p(K) in Fig. 43-10 is the probability of barrier penetration
by two colliding protons. The two curves in Fig. 43-10 suggest that there is a par-
ticular proton energy at which proton–proton fusion events occur at a maximum
rate.At energies much above this value, the barrier is transparent enough but too
few protons have these energies, and so the fusion reaction cannot be sustained.
At energies much below this value, plenty of protons have these energies but the
Coulomb barrier is too formidable.
Figure 43-10 The curve marked n(K) gives the
number density per unit energy for protons
at the center of the Sun.The curve marked
p(K) gives the probability of barrier pene-
tration (and hence fusion) for proton–proton
collisions at the Sun’s core temperature.
The vertical line marks the value of kT at
this temperature. Note that the two curves
are drawn to (separate) arbitrary vertical
scales.

Checkpoint 2
Which of these potential fusion reactions will not result in the net release of energy:
(a) 6Li ' 6Li, (b) 4He ' 4He, (c) 12C ' 12C, (d) 20Ne ' 20Ne, (e) 35Cl ' 35Cl, and (f) 
14N ' 35Cl? (Hint: Consult the curve of Fig. 42-7.)
This yields, with known values,
(Answer)
(b) At what temperature would a proton in a gas of protons
have the average kinetic energy calculated in (a) and thus have
energy equal to the height of the Coulomb barrier?
KEY IDEA
If we treat the proton gas as an ideal gas, then from Eq.
19-24, the average energy of the protons is 
where k is the Boltzmann constant.
Calculation: Solving that equation for T and using the 
result of (a) yield
(Answer)
The temperature of the core of the Sun is only about 
1.5 " 107 K; thus fusion in the Sun’s core must involve pro-
tons whose energies are far above the average energy.

Sample Problem 43.03
Fusion in a gas of protons, and the required temperature
Assume a proton is a sphere of radius R
1 fm. Two protons
are fired at each other with the same kinetic energy K.
(a) What must K be if the particles are brought to rest
by their mutual Coulomb repulsion when they are just
“touching” each other? We can take this value of K as a
representative measure of the height of the Coulomb
barrier.
KEY IDEAS
The mechanical energy E of the two-proton system is con-
served as the protons move toward each other and momen-
tarily stop. In particular, the initial mechanical energy Ei is
equal to the mechanical energy Ef when they stop. The ini-
tial energy Ei consists only of the total kinetic energy 2K of
the two protons. When the protons stop, energy Ef consists
only of the electric potential energy U of the system, as
given by Eq. 24-46 (U ! q1q2/4p´0r).
Calculations: Here the distance r between the protons
when they stop is their center-to-center distance 2R, and
their charges q1 and q2 are both e. Then we can write the
conservation of energy Ei ! Ef as
