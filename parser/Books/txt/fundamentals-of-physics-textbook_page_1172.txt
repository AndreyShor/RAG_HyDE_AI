rest length. (a) To three significant figures, what is the speed
parameter b of the spaceship relative to the observer’s frame?

A space traveler takes off from Earth and moves at speed
0.9900c toward the star Vega, which is 26.00 ly distant. How much
time will have elapsed by Earth clocks (a) when the traveler
reaches Vega and (b) when Earth observers receive word from the
traveler that she has arrived? (c) How much older will Earth ob-
servers calculate the traveler to be (measured from her frame)
when she reaches Vega than she was when she started the trip?

A rod is to move at con-
stant speed v along the x axis of
reference frame S, with the rod’s
length parallel to that axis. An ob-
server in frame S is to measure the
length L of the rod. Figure 37-23
gives length L versus speed param-
eter b for a range of values for b.
The vertical axis scale is set by 
La ! 1.00 m.What is L if v ! 0.95c?

The center of our Milky
Way galaxy is about 23 000 ly away. (a) To eight significant figures,
at what constant speed parameter would you need to travel exactly
23 000 ly (measured in the Galaxy frame) in exactly 30 y (mea-
sured in your frame)? (b) Measured in your frame and in light-
years, what length of the Galaxy would pass by you during the trip?

Observer S reports that an event occurred on the x axis of his
reference frame at x ! 3.00 ( 108 m at time t ! 2.50 s. Observer S#
and her frame are moving in the positive direction of the x axis at a
speed of 0.400c. Further, x ! x# ! 0 at t ! t# ! 0. What are the
(a) spatial and (b) temporal coordinate of the event according to
S#? If S# were, instead, moving in the negative direction of the 
x axis, what would be the (c) spatial and (d) temporal coordinate of
the event according to S#?

Inertial frame S# moves at a speed of 0.60c with respect to
frame S (Fig. 37-9). Further, x ! x# ! 0 at t ! t# ! 0.Two events are
recorded. In frame S, event 1 occurs at the origin at t ! 0 and event
2 occurs on the x axis at x ! 3.0 km at t ! 4.0 ms. According to
observer S#, what is the time of (a) event 1 and (b) event 2? (c) Do
the two observers see the same sequence or the reverse?

An experimenter arranges to trigger two flashbulbs
simultaneously, producing a big flash located at the origin of his
reference frame and a small flash at x ! 30.0 km. An observer
moving at a speed of 0.250c in the positive direction of x also views
the flashes. (a) What is the time interval between them according
to her? (b) Which flash does she say occurs first?

As in Fig. 37-9, reference
frame 
passes reference frame S
with a certain velocity. Events 1 and
2 are to have a certain temporal
separation 2t# according to the S#
observer.
However,
their spatial
separation 2x# according to that
observer has not been set yet. Figure
37-24 gives their temporal separa-
tion 2t according to the S observer
as a function of 2x# for a range of
2x# values. The vertical axis scale is
set by 2ta ! 6.00 ms.What is 2t#?

Relativistic reversal of events. Figures 37-25a and b show the
(usual) situation in which a primed reference frame passes an un-
primed reference frame, in the common positive direction of the x
and x# axes, at a constant relative velocity of magnitude v. We are
at rest in the unprimed frame; Bullwinkle, an astute student of rela-
tivity in spite of his cartoon upbringing, is at rest in the primed
frame. The figures also indicate events A and B that occur at the
following spacetime coordinates as measured in our unprimed
frame and in Bullwinkle’s primed frame:

In our frame, event A occurs before event B, with temporal separa-
tion 2t ! tB & tA ! 1.00 ms and spatial separation 2x ! xB & xA !

be the temporal separation of the events according
to Bullwinkle. (a) Find an expression for
