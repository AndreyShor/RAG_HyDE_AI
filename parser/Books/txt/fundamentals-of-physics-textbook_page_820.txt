again rank the segments. (c) What is the direction of the electric
field along the x axis?

For each circuit in Fig. 27-20, are the resistors connected in se-
ries, in parallel, or neither?

Res-monster maze. In Fig. 27-21, all the resistors have a resis-
tance of 4.0 0 and all the (ideal) batteries have an emf of 4.0 V.
What is the current through resistor R? (If you can find the proper
loop through this maze, you can answer the question with a few
seconds of mental calculation.)
7
A resistor R1 is wired to a battery, then resistor R2 is added
in series. Are (a) the potential difference across R1 and (b) the
current i1 through R1 now more than, less than, or the same as pre-
viously? (c) Is the equivalent resistance R12 of R1 and R2 more
than, less than, or equal to R1?
8
What is the equivalent resistance of three resistors, each of
resistance R, if they are connected to an ideal battery (a) in se-
ries with one another and (b) in parallel with one another? (c)
Is the potential difference across the series arrangement
greater than, less than, or equal to that across the parallel
arrangement?
9
Two resistors are wired to a battery. (a) In which arrangement,
parallel or series, are the potential differences across each resistor
and across the equivalent resistance all equal? (b) In which
arrangement are the currents through each resistor and through
the equivalent resistance all equal?
10
Cap-monster maze. In Fig. 27-22, all the capacitors have a
capacitance of 6.0 mF, and all the batteries have an emf of 10 V.
What is the charge on capacitor C? (If you can find the proper loop
through this maze, you can answer the question with a few seconds
of mental calculation.)
11
Initially, a single resistor R1 is wired to a battery.Then resistor
R2 is added in parallel. Are (a) the potential difference across R1
and (b) the current i1 through R1 now more than, less than, or the
same as previously? (c) Is the equivalent resistance R12 of R1 and
R2 more than, less than, or equal to R1? (d) Is the total current
through R1 and R2 together more than, less than, or equal to the
current through R1 previously?
12
After the switch in Fig. 27-15 is closed on point a, there is cur-
rent i through resistance R. Figure 27-23 gives that current for four
sets of values of R and capacitance C: (1) R0 and C0, (2) 2R0 and C0,
(3) R0 and 2C0, (4) 2R0 and 2C0. Which set goes with which curve?

Figure 27-24 shows three sections of circuit that are to be con-
nected in turn to the same battery via a switch as in Fig. 27-15.The
resistors are all identical, as are the capacitors. Rank the sections
according to (a) the final (equilibrium) charge on the capacitor and
(b) the time required for the capacitor to reach 50% of its final
charge, greatest first.
