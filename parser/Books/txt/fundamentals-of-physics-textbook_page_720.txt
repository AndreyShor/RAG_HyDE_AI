To find the potential of
the charged particle,
we move this test charge
out to infinity.
Figure 24-9 The particle with positive charge
q produces an electric field 
and an elec-
tric potential V at point P. We find the
potential by moving a test charge q0 from
P to infinity. The test charge is shown at

24-3 POTENTIAL DUE TO A CHARGED PARTICLE
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
24.14 For a given point in the electric field of a charged parti-
cle, apply the relationship between the electric potential V,
the charge of the particle q, and the distance r from the
particle.
24.15 Identify the correlation between the algebraic signs of the
potential set up by a particle and the charge of the particle.
24.16 For points outside or on the surface of a spherically
symmetric charge distribution, calculate the electric
potential as if all the charge is concentrated as a particle
at the center of the sphere.
24.17 Calculate the net potential at any given point due to
several charged particles, identifying that algebraic addi-
tion is used, not vector addition.
24.18 Draw equipotential lines for a charged particle.

Key Ideas
Potential Due to a Charged Particle
We now use Eq. 24-18 to derive, for the space around a charged particle, an
expression for the electric potential V relative to the zero potential at infinity.
Consider a point P at distance R from a fixed particle of positive charge q (Fig.24-9).
To use Eq. 24-18, we imagine that we move a positive test charge q0 from point P to
infinity.Because the path we take does not matter,let us choose the simplest one—
a line that extends radially from the fixed particle through P to infinity.
To use Eq. 24-18, we must evaluate the dot product
(24-22)
The electric field 
in Fig. 24-9 is directed radially outward from the fixed 
particle.Thus,the differential displacement 
of the test particle along its path has
the same direction as 
. That means that in Eq. 24-22, angle u
0 and cos u
1.
Because the path is radial,let us write ds as dr.Then,substituting the limits R and 0,
we can write Eq.24-18 as
(24-23)
Next, we set Vf $ 0 (at 0) and Vi $ V (at R). Then, for the magnitude of the
electric field at the site of the test charge, we substitute from Eq. 22-3:
(24-24)
With these changes, Eq. 24-23 then gives us
