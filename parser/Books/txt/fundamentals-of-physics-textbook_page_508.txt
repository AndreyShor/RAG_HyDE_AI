After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
17.05 For any particular time and position, calculate the dis-
placement s(x, t) of an element of air as a sound wave travels
through its location.
17.06 Given a displacement function s(x, t) for a sound wave,
calculate the time between two given displacements.
17.07 Apply the relationships between wave speed v, angular
frequency v, angular wave number k, wavelength l, period
T, and frequency f.
17.08 Sketch a graph of the displacement s(x) of an element
of air as a function of position, and identify the amplitude
sm and wavelength l.
17.09 For any particular time and position, calculate the pres-
sure variation 
(variation from atmospheric pressure) of an
element of air as a sound wave travels through its location.
17.10 Sketch a graph of the pressure variation %p(x) of an el-
ement as a function of position, and identify the amplitude
%pm and wavelength l.
17.11 Apply the relationship between pressure-variation am-
plitude %pm and displacement amplitude sm.
17.12 Given a graph of position s versus time for a sound
wave, determine the amplitude sm and the period T.
17.13 Given a graph of pressure variation %p versus time
for a sound wave, determine the amplitude %pm and the
period T.

Learning Objectives
●A sound wave causes a longitudinal displacement s of a
mass element in a medium as given by
s # sm cos(kx $ vt),
where sm is the displacement amplitude (maximum displace-
ment) from equilibrium, k # 2p/l, and v # 2pf, l and f being
the wavelength and frequency, respectively, of the sound wave. 
●The sound wave also causes a pressure change 
of the
medium from the equilibrium pressure:
%p # %pm sin(kx $ vt),
where the pressure amplitude is
%pm # (vrv)sm.

Key Ideas
Thus, from Newton’s second law (F # ma), we have, from Eqs. 17-5, 17-6,
and 17-7,
(17-8)
which we can write as
(17-9)
The air that occupies a volume V (# Av %t) outside the pulse is compressed by an
amount %V (# A %v %t) as it enters the pulse.Thus,
(17-10)
Substituting Eq. 17-10 and then Eq. 17-2 into Eq. 17-9 leads to
(17-11)
Solving for v yields Eq. 17-3 for the speed of the air toward the right in Fig. 17-3,
and thus for the actual speed of the pulse toward the left.

Traveling Sound Waves
Here we examine the displacements and pressure variations associated with a
sinusoidal sound wave traveling through air. Figure 17-4a displays such a wave
traveling rightward through a long air-filled tube. Recall from Chapter 16 that
we can produce such a wave by sinusoidally moving a piston at the left end of
