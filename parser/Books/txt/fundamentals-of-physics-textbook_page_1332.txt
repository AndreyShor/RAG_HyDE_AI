of the recoiling 32S atom in this event? (Hint: For the electron it is
necessary to use the relativistic expressions for kinetic energy and
linear momentum.The 32S atom is nonrelativistic.)

A 5.00 g charcoal sample from an ancient fire pit has a 14C
activity of 63.0 disintegrations/min. A living tree has a 14C activity
of 15.3 disintegrations/min per 1.00 g. The half-life of 14C is 5730 y.

The isotope 238U decays to 206Pb with a half-life of 4.47 " 109
y.Although the decay occurs in many individual steps, the first step
has by far the longest half-life; therefore, one can often consider
the decay to go directly to lead.That is,
A rock is found to contain 4.20 mg of 238U and 2.135 mg of 206Pb.
Assume that the rock contained no lead at formation, so all the
lead now present arose from the decay of uranium. How many
atoms of (a) 238U and (b) 206Pb does the rock now contain? (c) How
many atoms of 238U did the rock contain at formation? (d) What is
the age of the rock?
••62
A particular rock is thought to be 260 million years old. If it
contains 3.70 mg of 238U, how much 206Pb should it contain? See
Problem 61.
••63
A rock recovered from far underground is found to con-
tain 0.86 mg of 238U, 0.15 mg of 206Pb, and 1.6 mg of 40Ar. How
much 40K will it likely contain? Assume that 40K decays to only
40Ar with a half-life of 1.25 " 109 y. Also assume that 238U has a
half-life of 4.47 " 109 y.

The isotope 40K can decay to either 40Ca or 40Ar; assume

Radioactive element AA can decay to either element BB or
element CC.The decay depends on chance,but the ratio of the result-
ing number of BB atoms to the resulting number of CC atoms is al-
ways 2/1.The decay has a half-life of 8.00 days.We start with a sample
of pure AA. How long must we wait until the number of CC atoms is
1.50 times the number  of AA atoms?

One of the dangers of radioactive fallout from a nu-
clear bomb is its 90Sr, which decays with a 29-year half-life. Because
it has chemical properties much like those of calcium, the stron-
tium, if ingested by a cow, becomes concentrated in the cow’s milk.
Some of the 90Sr ends up in the bones of whoever drinks the milk.
The energetic electrons emitted in the beta decay of 90Sr damage
the bone marrow and thus impair the production of red blood cells.
A 1 megaton bomb produces approximately 400 g of 90Sr. If the
fallout spreads uniformly over a 2000 km2 area, what ground area

only 40K.It now has equal amounts of 40K and 40Ar;that is,the ratio of
