CHAPTER 7
KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK
of magnitude 20.0 N is applied to a
3.00 kg psychology book as the book
slides a distance d ! 0.500 m up a fric-
tionless ramp at angle u ! 30.0(. (a)
During the displacement, what is the net
work done on the book by 
, the gravi-
tational force on the book, and the nor-
mal force on the book? (b) If the book
has zero kinetic energy at the start of the
displacement,what is its speed at the end of the displacement?

In Fig.7-34,a 0.250 kg block of cheese lies on
the floor of a 900 kg elevator cab that is being pulled
upward by a cable through distance d1 ! 2.40 m and
then through distance d2 ! 10.5 m. (a) Through d1, if
the normal force on the block from the floor has con-
stant magnitude FN ! 3.00 N, how much work is done
on the cab by the force from the cable? (b) Through d2,
if the work done on the cab by the (constant) force
from the cable is 92.61 kJ,what is the magnitude of FN?

Work Done by a Spring Force
•26
In Fig.7-10,we must apply a force of magnitude 80 N to hold the
block stationary at x ! $2.0 cm. From that position, we then slowly
move the block so that our force does "4.0 J of work on the
spring–block system; the block is then again stationary. What is the
block’s position? (Hint:There are two answers.)
•27
A spring and block are in the arrangement of Fig.7-10.When the
block is pulled out to x ! "4.0 cm,we must apply a force of magnitude
360 N to hold it there.We pull the block to x ! 11 cm and then release
it. How much work does the spring do on the block as the block
moves from xi ! "5.0 cm to (a) x ! "3.0 cm, (b) x ! $3.0 cm,
(c) x ! $5.0 cm,and (d) x ! $9.0 cm?

During spring semester at MIT, residents of the parallel build-
ings of the East Campus dorms battle one another with large cata-
pults that are made with surgical hose mounted on a window frame.
A balloon filled with dyed water is placed in a pouch attached to the
hose, which is then stretched through the width of the room.Assume
that the stretching of the hose obeys Hooke’s law with a spring con-
stant of 100 N/m.If the hose is stretched by 5.00 m and then released,
how much work does the force from the hose do on the balloon in
the pouch by the time the hose reaches its relaxed length?

In the arrangement of Fig. 7-10, we gradually pull the block
from x ! 0 to x ! "3.0 cm, where it is stationary. Figure 7-35 gives

In Fig. 7-33, a horizontal force
along the axis begins to act on it.
Figure 7-29 gives its kinetic energy
K versus position x as it moves
from x ! 0 to x ! 5.0 m; K0 ! 30.0
J. The force continues to act. What
is v when the object moves back
through x ! $3.0 m?

Work Done by
the Gravitational Force

A helicopter lifts a 72 kg astronaut 15 m verti-
cally from the ocean by means of a cable. The acceleration of the
astronaut is g/10. How much work is done on the astronaut by
(a) the force from the helicopter and (b) the gravitational force on
her? Just before she reaches the helicopter, what are her (c) kinetic
energy and (d) speed?

(a) In 1975 the roof of Montreal’s Velodrome, with
a weight of 360 kN, was lifted by 10 cm so that it could be centered.
How much work was done on the roof by the forces making the
lift? (b) In 1960 a Tampa, Florida, mother reportedly raised one
end of a car that had fallen onto her son when a jack failed. If her
panic lift effectively raised 4000 N (about of the car’s weight) by
5.0 cm, how much work did her force do on the car?

In Fig. 7-30, a block of ice
slides down a frictionless ramp at angle
50( while an ice worker pulls on
the block (via a rope) with a force 
that has a magnitude of 50 N and is di-
rected up the ramp. As the block slides
through distance d
0.50 m along the
ramp, its kinetic energy increases by 80
J. How much greater would its kinetic
energy have been if the rope had not
been attached to the block?
••20
A block is sent up a frictionless
ramp along which an x axis extends up-
ward. Figure 7-31 gives the kinetic en-
ergy of the block as a function of posi-
tion x; the scale of the figure’s vertical
axis is set by Ks ! 40.0 J. If the block’s
initial speed is 4.00 m/s, what is the nor-
mal force on the block?
••21
A cord is used to vertically
lower an initially stationary block of
mass M at a constant downward acceleration of g/4.When the block
has fallen a distance d, find (a) the work done by the cord’s force on
the block, (b) the work done by the gravitational force on the block,
(c) the kinetic energy of the block,and (d) the speed of the block.
••22
A cave rescue team lifts an injured spelunker directly upward
and out of a sinkhole by means of a motor-driven cable. The lift is
performed in three stages, each requiring a vertical distance of 10.0
m: (a) the initially stationary spelunker is accelerated to a speed of
5.00 m/s; (b) he is then lifted at the con-
stant speed of 5.00 m/s; (c) finally he is
decelerated to zero speed. How much
work is done on the 80.0 kg rescuee by
the force lifting him during each stage?

In Fig.7-32,a constant force 
of
