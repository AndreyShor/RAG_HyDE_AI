We can then rewrite Eq. 33-24 as
.
(33-26)
Because E ! cB and c is such a very large number, you might conclude that
the energy associated with the electric field is much greater than that associated
with the magnetic field.That conclusion is incorrect; the two energies are exactly
equal. To show this, we start with Eq. 25-25, which gives the energy density
within an electric field, and substitute cB for E; then we can write
If we now substitute for c with Eq. 33-3, we get
However, Eq. 30-55 tells us that B2/2m0 is the energy density uB of a magnetic
field ; so we see that uE ! uB everywhere along an electromagnetic wave.
Variation of Intensity with Distance
How intensity varies with distance from a real source of electromagnetic radia-
tion is often complex—especially when the source (like a searchlight at a
movie premier) beams the radiation in a particular direction. However, in some
situations we can assume that the source is a point source that emits the light
isotropically—that is, with equal intensity in all directions. The spherical wave-
fronts spreading from such an isotropic point source S at a particular instant are
shown in cross section in Fig. 33-8.
Let us assume that the energy of the waves is conserved as they spread from this
source. Let us also center an imaginary sphere of radius r on the source, as shown in
Fig.33-8.All the energy emitted by the source must pass through the sphere.Thus,the
rate at which energy passes through the sphere via the radiation must equal the rate
at which energy is emitted by the source—that is,the source power Ps.The intensity I
(power per unit area) measured at the sphere must then be,from Eq.33-23,
(33-27)
where 4pr2 is the area of the sphere. Equation 33-27 tells us that the intensity of
the electromagnetic radiation from an isotropic point source decreases with the
square of the distance r from the source.
