atoms are taken away is increased, and so is the rate at which atoms
are brought back. It turns out to be very difficult, in general, to
predict which way it is going to go, whether more or less of the
solid will dissolve. Most substances dissolve more, but some sub-
stances dissolve less, as the temperature increases.
Chemical reactions
In all of the processes which have been described so far, the atoms
and the ions have not changed partners, but of course there are cir-
cumstances in which the atoms do change combinations, forming
new molecules. This is illustrated in Fig. 1-8. A process in which
the rearrangement of the atomic partners occurs is what we call a
chemical reaction. The other processes so far described are called
physical processes, but there is no sharp distinction between the
two. (Nature does not care what we call it, she just keeps on doing
it.) This Ô¨Ågure is supposed to represent carbon burning in oxygen.
In the case of oxygen, two oxygen atoms stick together very
strongly. (Why do not three or even four stick together? That is one
of the very peculiar characteristics of such atomic processes. Atoms
are very special: they like certain particular partners, certain par-
ticular directions, and so on. It is the job of physics to analyze why
each one wants what it wants. At any rate, two oxygen atoms form,
saturated and happy, a molecule.)
