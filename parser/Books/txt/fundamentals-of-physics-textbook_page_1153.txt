This time interval 2t is not a proper time interval because the two events that
define it (Sally passes the back of the platform and Sally passes the front of
the platform) occur at two different places, and therefore Sam must use two syn-
chronized clocks to measure the time interval 2t.
For Sally, however, the platform is moving past her. She finds that the two
events measured by Sam occur at the same place in her reference frame. She can
time them with a single stationary clock, and so the interval t0 that she measures
is a proper time interval.To her, the length L of the platform is given by
L ! v 2t0
(Sally).

If we divide Eq. 37-15 by Eq. 37-14 and apply Eq. 37-9, the time dilation equation,
we have
or
(37-16)
which is Eq. 37-13, the length contraction equation.

37-2 THE RELATIVITY OF LENGTH
Sample Problem 37.03
Time dilation and length contraction as seen from each frame
In Fig. 37-8, Sally (at point A) and Sam’s spaceship (of
proper length L0 ! 230 m) pass each other with constant
relative speed v. Sally measures a time interval of 3.57 ms for
the ship to pass her (from the passage of point B in
Fig. 37-8a to the passage of point C in Fig. 37-8b). In terms of
c, what is the relative speed v between Sally and the ship?
KEY IDEAS
Let’s assume that speed v is near c. Then:
1.
This problem involves measurements made from two
(inertial) reference frames, one attached to Sally and the
other attached to Sam and his spaceship.
2.
This problem also involves two events: the first is the
passage of point B past Sally (Fig. 37-8a) and the second
is the passage of point C past her (Fig. 37-8b).

From either reference frame, the other reference frame
passes at speed v and moves a certain distance in the
time interval between the two events:
(37-17)
Because speed v is assumed to be near the speed of light,
we must be careful that the distance and the time interval
in Eq. 37-17 are measured in the same reference frame.
Calculations: We are free to use either frame for the mea-
surements. Because we know that the time interval 2t be-
tween the two events measured from Sally’s frame is 3.57 ms,
let us also use the distance L between the two events mea-
sured from her frame. Equation 37-17 then becomes
