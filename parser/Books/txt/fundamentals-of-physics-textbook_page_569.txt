Calculate the specific heat of a metal from the following
data. A container made of the metal has a mass of 3.6 kg and con-
tains 14 kg of water. A 1.8 kg piece of the metal initially at a tem-
perature of 180 C is dropped into the water. The container and
water initially have a temperature of 16.0 C, and the final tempera-
ture of the entire (insulated) system is 18.0 C.

(a) Two 50 g ice cubes are dropped into 200 g
of water in a thermally insulated container. If the water is initially
at 25 C, and the ice comes directly from a freezer at $15 C, what is
the final temperature at thermal equilibrium? (b) What is the final
temperature if only one ice cube is used?

heat lost to the surroundings. The
sphere just passes through the
ring at the equilibrium tempera-
