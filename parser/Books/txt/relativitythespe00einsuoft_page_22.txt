4     SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
Of  course  the  conviction  of  the  "  truth  "  of  geo 
metrical  propositions  in  this  sense  is  founded  exclusively 
on  rather  incomplete  experience.  For  the  present  we 
shall  assume  the  "  truth  "  of  the  geometrical  proposi 
tions,  then  at  a  later  stage  (in  the  general  theory  of 
relativity)  we  shall  see  that  this  "  truth  "  is  limited, 
and  we  shall  consider  the  extent  of  its  limitation.
