This is a graph
of position x
versus time t.
To find average velocity,
first draw a straight line,
start to end, and then
find the slope of the
line.
A
toward x " 0, passes through that point at t " 3 s, and then moves on to increas-
ingly larger positive values of x. Figure 2-3 also depicts the straight-line motion of
the armadillo (at three times) and is something like what you would see. The
graph in Fig. 2-3 is more abstract, but it reveals how fast the armadillo moves.
Actually, several quantities are associated with the phrase “how fast.” One of
them is the average velocity vavg, which is the ratio of the displacement -x that
occurs during a particular time interval -t to that interval:
(2-2)
The notation means that the position is x1 at time t1 and then x2 at time t2.A com-
mon unit for vavg is the meter per second (m/s). You may see other units in the
problems, but they are always in the form of length/time.
Graphs. On a graph of x versus t, vavg is the slope of the straight line that
connects two particular points on the x(t) curve: one is the point that corresponds
to x2 and t2, and the other is the point that corresponds to x1 and t1. Like displace-
ment, vavg has both magnitude and direction (it is another vector quantity). Its
magnitude is the magnitude of the line’s slope.A positive vavg (and slope) tells us
that the line slants upward to the right; a negative vavg (and slope) tells us that the
line slants downward to the right. The average velocity vavg always has the same
sign as the displacement -x because -t in Eq. 2-2 is always positive.
Figure 2-4 shows how to find vavg in Fig.2-3 for the time interval t " 1 s to t " 4 s.
We draw the straight line that connects the point on the position curve at the begin-
ning of the interval and the point on the curve at the end of the interval.Then we find
the slope -x/-t of the straight line. For the given time interval, the average velocity is
Average speed savg is a different way of describing “how fast” a particle
moves. Whereas the average velocity involves the particle’s displacement -x, the
average speed involves the total distance covered (for example, the number of
meters moved), independent of direction; that is,
(2-3)
Because average speed does not include direction, it lacks any algebraic sign.
Sometimes savg is the same (except for the absence of a sign) as vavg. However, the
two can be quite different.
