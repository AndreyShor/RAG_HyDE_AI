THE  EXPERIMENT  OF  FIZEAU        89 
This  equation  expresses  nothing  else  than  the  law  of 
motion  of  the  point  with  reference  to  the  system  K 
(of  the  man  with  reference  to  the  embankment).  We 
denote  this  velocity  by  the  symbol  W,  and  we  then 
obtain,  as  in  Section  VI, 
.        .        .        (A). 
But  we  can  carry  out  this  consideration  just  as  well 
on  the  basis  of  the  theory  of  relativity.     In  the  equation 
x'=wt' 
we  must  then  express  x'  and  t'  in  terms  of  x  and  t,  making 
use  of  the  first  and  fourth  equations  of  the  Lorentz 
transformation.  Instead  of  the  equation  (A)  we  then 
obtain  the  equation 
which  corresponds  to  the  theorem  of  addition  for 
velocities  in  one  direction  according  to  the  theory  of 
relativity.  The  question  now  arises  as  to  which  of  these 
two  theorems  is  the  better  in  accord  with  experience.  On 
this  point  we  are  enlightened  by  a  most  important  experi 
ment  which  the  brilliant  physicist  Fizeau  performed  more 
than  half  a  century  ago,  and  which  has  been  repeated 
since  then  by  some  of  the  best  experimental  physicists, 
so  that  there  can  be  no  doubt  about  its  result.  The 
experiment  is  concerned  with  the  following  question. 
Light  travels  in  a  motionless  liquid  with  a  particular 
velocity  w.  How  quickly  does  it  travel  in  the  direction 
of  the  arrow  in  the  tube  T  (see  the  accompanying  diagram, 
Fig.  3)  when  the  liquid  above  mentioned  is  flowing 
through  the  tube  with  a  velocity  v  ?
