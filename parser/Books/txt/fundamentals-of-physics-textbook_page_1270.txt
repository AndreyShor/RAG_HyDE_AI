atoms to state E3, which is metastable with a mean life of at least 1 ms. (The neon
atoms are too massive to be excited by collisions with the (low-mass) electrons.)
The energy of helium state E3 (20.61 eV) is very close to the energy of neon
state E2 (20.66 eV). Thus, when a metastable (E3) helium atom and a ground-
state (E0) neon atom collide, the excitation energy of the helium atom is often
transferred to the neon atom, which then moves to state E2. In this manner, neon
level E2 (with a mean life of 170 ns) can become more heavily populated than
neon level E1 (which, with a mean life of only 10 ns, is almost empty).
This population inversion is relatively easy to set up because (1) initially there
are essentially no neon atoms in state E1, (2) the long mean life of helium level E3
means that there is always a good chance that collisions will excite neon atoms to
their E2 level,and (3) once those neon atoms undergo stimulated emission and fall to
their E1 level, they almost immediately fall down to their ground state (via
intermediate levels not shown) and are then ready to be re-excited by collisions.
Suppose now that a single photon is spontaneously emitted as a neon atom
transfers from state E2 to state E1. Such a photon can trigger a stimulated emis-
sion event, which, in turn, can trigger other stimulated emission events. Through
such a chain reaction, a coherent beam of laser light, moving parallel to the tube
axis, can build up rapidly.This light, of wavelength 632.8 nm (red), moves through
the discharge tube many times by successive reflections from mirrors M1 and M2
shown in Fig. 40-20, accumulating additional stimulated emission photons with
each passage. M1 is totally reflecting, but M2 is slightly “leaky” so that a small 
fraction of the laser light escapes to form a useful external beam.

Checkpoint 3
The wavelength of light from laser A (a helium–neon gas laser) is 632.8 nm;that from
laser B (a carbon dioxide gas laser) is 10.6 mm;that from laser C (a gallium arsenide
semiconductor laser) is 840 nm.Rank these lasers according to the energy interval be-
tween the two quantum states responsible for laser action,greatest first.
Calculation: The lasing wavelength gives us
To solve Eq. 40-30, we also need the mean energy of thermal
agitation kT for an atom at room temperature (assumed to
be 300 K), which is
kT ! (8.62 " 10#5 eV/K)(300 K) ! 0.0259 eV,
in which k is Boltzmann’s constant.
Substituting the last two results into Eq. 40-30 gives us
the population ratio at room temperature:
(Answer)
This is an extremely small number. It is not unreasonable,
however. Atoms with a mean thermal agitation energy of

Sample Problem 40.04
Population inversion in a laser
In the helium–neon laser of Fig. 40-20, laser action occurs
between two excited states of the neon atom. However, in
many lasers, laser action (lasing) occurs between the ground
state and an excited state, as suggested in Fig. 40-19b.
(a) Consider such a laser that emits at wavelength l ! 550
nm. If a population inversion is not generated, what is the
ratio of the population of atoms in state Ex to the population
in the ground state E0, with the atoms at room temperature?
KEY IDEAS
(1) The naturally occurring population ratio Nx/N0 of the two
states is due to thermal agitation of the gas atoms (Eq. 40-29):
(40-30)
To find Nx/N0 with Eq. 40-30, we need to find the energy
separation Ex # E0 between the two states. (2) We can ob-
tain Ex # E0 from the given wavelength of 550 nm for the
lasing between those two states.
Nx/N0 ! e#(Ex#E0)/kT.
