For the rabbit in the preceding sample problem, find the 
velocity 
at time t " 15 s.
KEY IDEA
We can find 
by taking derivatives of the components of
the rabbit’s position vector.
Calculations: Applying the vx part of Eq. 4-12 to Eq. 4-5,
we find the x component of 
to be
(4-13)
At t " 15 s, this gives vx " $2.1 m/s. Similarly, applying the
vy part of Eq. 4-12 to Eq. 4-6, we find
(4-14)
At t " 15 s, this gives vy " $2.5 m/s. Equation 4-11 then yields
(Answer)
which is shown in Fig. 4-5, tangent to the rabbit’s path and in
the direction the rabbit is running at t " 15 s.
To get the magnitude and angle of , either we use a
vector-capable calculator or we follow Eq. 3-6 to write

the average acceleration vector in magnitude-angle and
unit-vector notations.
4.11 Given a particle’s velocity vector as a function of time,
determine its (instantaneous) acceleration vector.
4.12 For each dimension of motion, apply the constant-
acceleration equations (Chapter 2) to relate acceleration,
velocity, position, and time.
Learning Objectives
After reading this module, you should be able to . . . 
4.08 Identify that acceleration is a vector quantity and thus has
both magnitude and direction and also has components.
4.09 Draw two-dimensional and three-dimensional accelera-
tion vectors for a particle, indicating the components.
4.10 Given the initial and final velocity vectors of a particle
and the time interval between those velocities, determine
either the acceleration or the instantaneous acceleration :
