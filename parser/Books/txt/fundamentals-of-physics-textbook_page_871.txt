29-3 AMPERE’S LAW
field at 
due to each current is in the plane of Fig. 29-12; thus, their net mag-
netic field 
at 
must also be in that plane. However, we do not know the ori-
entation of 
within the plane. In Fig. 29-12,
is arbitrarily drawn at an angle u
to the direction of 
. The scalar product 
on the left side of Eq. 29-14 is
equal to B cos u ds.Thus,Ampere’s law can be written as
(29-15)
We can now interpret the scalar product 
as being the product of a length ds
of the Amperian loop and the field component B cos u tangent to the loop.Then
we can interpret the integration as being the summation of all such products
around the entire loop.
Signs. When we can actually perform this integration, we do not need to
know the direction of 
before integrating. Instead, we arbitrarily assume 
to be
generally in the direction of integration (as in Fig. 29-12).Then we use the follow-
ing curled–straight right-hand rule to assign a plus sign or a minus sign to each of
the currents that make up the net encircled current ienc:

Only the currents

Curl your right hand around the Amperian loop, with the fingers pointing in the
direction of integration.A current through the loop in the general direction of your
outstretched thumb is assigned a plus sign, and a current generally in the opposite
direction is assigned a minus sign.
Finally, we solve Eq. 29-15 for the magnitude of 
. If B turns out positive, then
the direction we assumed for 
is correct. If it turns out negative, we neglect the
minus sign and redraw 
in the opposite direction.
Net Current. In Fig. 29-13 we apply the curled–straight right-hand rule for
Ampere’s law to the situation of Fig. 29-12. With the indicated counterclockwise
direction of integration, the net current encircled by the loop is
ienc ! i1 % i2.
(Current i3 is not encircled by the loop.) We can then rewrite Eq. 29-15 as
(29-16)
You might wonder why, since current i3 contributes to the magnetic-field mag-
nitude B on the left side of Eq. 29-16, it is not needed on the right side.The answer
is that the contributions of current i3 to the magnetic field cancel out because the
integration in Eq. 29-16 is made around the full loop. In contrast, the contributions
of an encircled current to the magnetic field do not cancel out.
We cannot solve Eq.29-16 for the magnitude B of the magnetic field because for
the situation of Fig. 29-12 we do not have enough information to simplify and solve
the integral.However,we do know the outcome of the integration;it must be equal to
m0(i1 % i2),the value of which is set by the net current passing through the loop.
We shall now apply Ampere’s law to two situations in which symmetry does
allow us to simplify and solve the integral, hence to find the magnetic field.
Magnetic Field Outside a Long Straight Wire with Current
Figure 29-14 shows a long straight wire that carries current i directly out of the
page. Equation 29-4 tells us that the magnetic field 
produced by the current has
the same magnitude at all points that are the same distance r from the wire; that is,
the field 
has cylindrical symmetry about the wire.We can take advantage of that
symmetry to simplify the integral in Ampere’s law (Eqs. 29-14 and 29-15) if we en-
circle the wire with a concentric circular Amperian loop of radius r, as in Fig. 29-14.
The magnetic field  then has the same magnitude B at every point on the loop.We
shall integrate counterclockwise,so that 
has the direction shown in Fig.29-14.
