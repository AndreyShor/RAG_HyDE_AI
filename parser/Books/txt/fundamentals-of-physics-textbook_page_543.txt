18-1 TEMPERATURE
level in the left arm of the U-tube can always be brought to the zero of the scale
to keep the gas volume constant (variations in the gas volume can affect tem-
perature measurements).
The temperature of any body in thermal contact with the bulb (such as the
liquid surrounding the bulb in Fig. 18-5) is then defined to be
T # Cp,
(18-2)
in which p is the pressure exerted by the gas and C is a constant. From Eq. 14-10,
the pressure p is
p # p0 $ rgh,
(18-3)
in which p0 is the atmospheric pressure, r is the density of the mercury in the
manometer, and h is the measured difference between the mercury levels in the
two arms of the tube.* (The minus sign is used in Eq. 18-3 because pressure p is
measured above the level at which the pressure is p0.)
If we next put the bulb in a triple-point cell (Fig. 18-4), the temperature now
being measured is
T3 # Cp3,
(18-4)
in which p3 is the gas pressure now. Eliminating C between Eqs. 18-2 and 18-4
gives us the temperature as
(provisional).
(18-5)
We still have a problem with this thermometer. If we use it to measure, say,
the boiling point of water, we find that different gases in the bulb give slightly
different results. However, as we use smaller and smaller amounts of gas to fill
the bulb, the readings converge nicely to a single temperature, no matter what
gas we use. Figure 18-6 shows this convergence for three gases.
Thus the recipe for measuring a temperature with a gas thermometer is
(18-6)
The recipe instructs us to measure an unknown temperature T as follows:
Fill the thermometer bulb with an arbitrary amount of any gas (for example,
nitrogen) and measure p3 (using a triple-point cell) and p, the gas pressure at 
the temperature being measured. (Keep the gas volume the same.) Calculate the
ratio p/p3.Then repeat both measurements with a smaller amount of gas in the bulb,
and again calculate this ratio. Continue this way, using smaller and smaller amounts
of gas,until you can extrapolate to the ratio p/p3 that you would find if there were ap-
proximately no gas in the bulb. Calculate the temperature T by substituting that ex-
trapolated ratio into Eq. 18-6. (The temperature is called the ideal gas temperature.)

*For pressure units, we shall use units introduced in Module 14-1. The SI unit for pressure is the
newton per square meter, which is called the pascal (Pa).The pascal is related to other common pres-
sure units by

Figure 18-6 Temperatures measured by a con-
stant-volume gas thermometer,with its bulb
immersed in boiling water.For temperature
calculations using Eq.18-5,pressure p3 was
measured at the triple point of water.Three
different gases in the thermometer bulb
gave generally different results at different gas
pressures,but as the amount of gas was
decreased (decreasing p3),all three curves con-
verged to 373.125 K.
