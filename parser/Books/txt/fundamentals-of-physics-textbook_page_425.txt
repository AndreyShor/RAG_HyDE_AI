14-6 THE EQUATION OF CONTINUITY
particles added to a gas flow (Fig. 14-12). Each bit of a tracer follows a stream-
line, which is the path that a tiny element of the fluid would take as the fluid
flows. Recall from Chapter 4 that the velocity of a particle is always tangent to
the path taken by the particle. Here the particle is the fluid element, and its ve-
locity 
is always tangent to a streamline (Fig. 14-14). For this reason, two
streamlines can never intersect; if they did, then an element arriving at
their intersection would have two different velocities simultaneously—an 
impossibility.
The Equation of Continuity
You may have noticed that you can increase the speed of the water emerging
from a garden hose by partially closing the hose opening with your thumb.
Apparently the speed v of the water depends on the cross-sectional area A
through which the water flows.
Here we wish to derive an expression that relates v and A for the steady flow
of an ideal fluid through a tube with varying cross section, like that in Fig. 14-15.
The flow there is toward the right, and the tube segment shown (part of a longer
tube) has length L.The fluid has speeds v1 at the left end of the segment and v2 at
the right end. The tube has cross-sectional areas A1 at the left end and A2 at the
right end. Suppose that in a time interval 't a volume 'V of fluid enters the tube
segment at its left end (that volume is colored purple in Fig. 14-15).Then, because
the fluid is incompressible, an identical volume 'V must emerge from the right
end of the segment (it is colored green in Fig. 14-15).

Figure 14-14 A fluid element traces out a
streamline as it moves.The velocity vector
of the element is tangent to the streamline
at every point.
Figure 14-15 Fluid flows from left to right at a steady
rate through a tube segment of length L.The fluid’s
speed is v1 at the left side and v2 at the right side.The
tube’s cross-sectional area is A1 at the left side and
A2 at the right side. From time t in (a) to time t # 't
in (b), the amount of fluid shown in purple enters at
the left side and the equal amount of fluid shown in
green emerges at the right side.
