40-4 EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE AND MULTIPLE ELECTRONS IN A TRAP
and draw a down arrow (to represent spin down) on the
E1,1 level in Fig. 40-12a. The second electron also goes into
the E1,1 level but must have 
so that one of its
quantum numbers differs from those of the first electron.
We represent this second electron with an up arrow (for
spin up) on the E1,1 level in Fig. 40-12b.
Electrons, one by one: The level for energy E1,1 is fully oc-
cupied, and thus the third electron cannot have that energy.
Therefore, the third electron goes into the next higher level,
which is for the equal energies E2,1 and E1,2 (the level is de-
generate). This third electron can have quantum numbers nx
and ny of either 1 and 2 or 2 and 1, respectively. It can also
have a quantum number ms of either 
or 
. Let us arbi-
trarily assign it the quantum numbers nx
2, ny
1, and
.We then represent it with a down arrow on the level
for E1,2 and E2,1 in Fig.40-12c.
You can show that the next three electrons can also go
into the level for energies E2,1 and E1,2, provided that no set
of three quantum numbers is completely duplicated. That
level then contains four electrons (Fig. 40-12d), with quan-
tum numbers (nx, ny, ms) of
and the level is fully occupied. Thus, the seventh electron
goes into the next higher level, which is the E2,2 level. Let us
assume this electron is spin down, with 
.
Figure 40-12e shows all seven electrons on a one-
electron energy-level diagram.We now have seven electrons
in the corral, and they are in the configuration with the low-
est energy that satisfies the Pauli exclusion principle. Thus,
the ground-state configuration of the system is that shown
in Fig. 40-12e and listed in Table 40-2.
(b) What is the total energy of the seven-electron system in
its ground state, as a multiple of h2/8mL2?
KEY IDEA
The total energy Egr is the sum of the energies of the indi-
vidual electrons in the systemâ€™s ground-state configuration.
Ground-state energy: The energy of each electron can be
read from Table 39-1, which is partially reproduced in
Table 40-2, or from Fig. 40-12e. Because there are two elec-
trons in the first (lowest) level, four in the second level,
and one in the third level, we have

KEY IDEAS
1.
If the system is to be excited, one of the seven electrons
must make a quantum jump up the one-electron energy-
level diagram of Fig. 40-12e.
2.
If that jump is to occur, the energy change )E of the
electron (and thus of the system) must be )E ! Ehigh #
Elow (Eq. 39-5), where Elow is the energy of the level
where the jump begins and Ehigh is the energy of the
level where the jump ends.
3.
The Pauli exclusion principle must still apply; an electron
cannot jump to a level that is fully occupied.
First-excited-state energy: Let us consider the three jumps
shown in Fig. 40-12f ; all are allowed by the Pauli exclusion
principle because they are jumps to either empty or par-
tially occupied states. In one of those possible jumps, an
electron jumps from the E1,1 level to the partially occupied
E2,2 level.The change in the energy is
(We shall assume that the spin orientation of the electron
making the jump can change as needed.)
In another of the possible jumps in Fig. 40-12f, an elec-
tron jumps from the degenerate level of E2,1 and E1,2 to the
partially occupied E2,2 level.The change in the energy is
In the third possible jump in Fig. 40-12f, the electron in
the E2,2 level jumps to the unoccupied, degenerate level of
E1,3 and E3,1.The change in energy is
