A double-slit arrangement produces bright interference
fringes for sodium light (a distinct yellow light at a wavelength of
l ! 589 nm).The fringes are angularly separated by 0.30° near the
center of the pattern. What is the angular fringe separation if the
entire arrangement is immersed in water, which has an index of
refraction of 1.33?

In Fig. 35-51a, the waves along rays 1 and 2 are initially in
phase, with the same wavelength l in air. Ray 2 goes through a ma-
terial with length L and index of refraction n. The rays are then
reflected by mirrors to a common point P on a screen. Suppose
that we can vary n from n ! 1.0 to n ! 2.5. Suppose also that, from
n ! 1.0 to n ! ns ! 1.5, the intensity I of the light at point P varies
with n as given in Fig. 35-51b.At what values of n greater than 1.4 is
intensity I (a) maximum and (b) zero? (c) What multiple of l gives
the phase difference between the rays at point P when n ! 2.0?

In Fig. 35-51a, the waves
along rays 1 and 2 are initially in phase,
with the same wavelength l in air. Ray
2 goes through a material with length L
and index of refraction n. The rays are
then reflected by mirrors to a common
point P on a screen. Suppose that we
can vary L from 0 to 2400 nm. Suppose
also that, from L ! 0 to Ls ! 900 nm,
the intensity I of the light at point P
varies with L as given in Fig. 35-52. At
what values of L greater than Ls is intensity I (a) maximum and
(b) zero? (c) What multiple of l gives the phase difference between
ray 1 and ray 2 at common point P when L ! 1200 nm?

Light of wavelength 700.0 nm is sent along a route of length
2000 nm.The route is then filled with a medium having an index of
refraction of 1.400. In degrees, by how much does the medium
phase-shift the light? Give (a) the full shift and (b) the equivalent
shift that has a value less than 360°.

In Fig. 35-53, a microwave transmitter at height a above
the water level of a wide lake transmits microwaves of wavelength
l toward a receiver on the opposite shore, a distance x above the
water level. The microwaves reflecting from the water interfere
with the microwaves arriving directly from the transmitter.

Assuming that the lake width D is much greater than a and x, and
that l 6 a, find an expression that gives the values of x for which
the signal at the receiver is maximum. (Hint: Does the reflection
cause a phase change?)

In Fig. 35-54, two isotropic point
sources S1 and S2 emit light at wavelength 
l ! 400 nm. Source S1 is located at y ! 640
nm; source S2 is located at y ! &640 nm.
At point P1 (at x ! 720 nm), the wave
from S2 arrives ahead of the wave from S1
by a phase difference of 0.600p rad. (a)
What multiple of l gives the phase differ-
ence between the waves from the two
sources as the waves arrive at point P2,
which is located at y ! 720 nm? (The figure is not drawn to
scale.) (b) If the waves arrive at P2 with equal amplitudes, is the
interference there fully constructive, fully destructive, intermedi-
ate but closer to fully constructive,
or intermediate but closer to fully
destructive?

Ocean waves moving at a
speed of 4.0 m/s are approaching a
beach at angle u1 ! 30°
to the
normal, as shown from above in
Fig. 35-55. Suppose the water depth
changes abruptly at a certain dis-
tance from the beach and the wave
speed 
there 
drops 
to 
3.0 m/s.
(a) Close to the beach, what is the angle u2 between the direction of
wave motion and the normal? (Assume the same law of refraction
as for light.) (b) Explain why most waves come in normal to a shore
even though at large distances they approach at a variety of angles.

Figure 35-56a shows two light rays that are initially in phase
as they travel upward through a block of plastic, with wavelength
400 nm as measured in air. Light ray r1 exits directly into air.
However, before light ray r2 exits into air, it travels through a liquid
in a hollow cylinder within the plastic. Initially the height Lliq of the
liquid is 40.0 mm, but then the liquid begins to evaporate. Let f be
the phase difference between rays r1 and r2 once they both exit into
the air. Figure 35-56b shows f versus the liquid’s height Lliq
until the liquid disappears, with f given in terms of wavelength and
the horizontal scale set by Ls! 40.00 mm.What are (a) the index of
refraction of the plastic and (b) the index of refraction of the
liquid?

If the distance between the first and tenth minima of
a double-slit pattern is 18.0 mm and the slits are separated by 0.150
mm with the screen 50.0 cm from the slits, what is the wavelength of
the light used?
