23-2 GAUSS’ LAW
Figure 23-10 (a) A charged plastic spherical shell encloses a 
charged particle. (b) To find the electric field at P1, arrange for
the point to be on a Gaussian sphere. The electric field pierces
outward. The area vector for the patch element is outward. (c) P2
is on a Gaussian sphere,
is inward, and 
is still outward.

The only charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface through P1
is that of the particle. Solving for E and substituting qenc $ 5e
and r $ r1 $ 6.00 ( 10'2 m, we find that the magnitude of the
electric field at P1 is
$ 2.00 ( 10'6N/C.
(Answer)
To find the electric field at P2, we follow the same pro-
cedure by constructing a Gaussian sphere with P2 on its sur-
face.This time,however,the net charge enclosed by the sphere
is qenc $ q " Q $ 5e " ('16e) $ '11e. Because the net
charge is negative, the electric field vectors on the sphere’s
surface pierce inward (Fig. 23-10c), the angle u between
and 
is 180%, and the dot product is E (cos 180%) dA $

where in the last step we pull the field magnitude E out of
the integral because it is the same at all points on the
Gaussian sphere and thus is a constant. The remaining inte-
gral is simply an instruction for us to sum the areas of all the
patch elements on the sphere, but we already know that the
surface area of a sphere is 4pr2. Substituting these results,
Eq. 23-7 for Gauss’ law gives us

For the front face we have 
, and for the back face,
.When we take the dot product of the given elec-
tric field 
with either of these expressions for

can now find the total flux through the six sides of the cube:
Enclosed charge: Next, we use Gauss’ law to find the
charge qenc enclosed by the cube:

Thus, the cube encloses a net positive charge.

Using Gauss’ law to find the enclosed charge
What is the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian cube of
Sample Problem 23.02? 
KEY IDEA
The net charge enclosed by a (real or mathematical) closed
surface is related to the total electric flux through the
surface by Gauss’ law as given by Eq. 23-6 (´0& $ qenc).
Flux: To use Eq. 23-6, we need to know the flux through all
six faces of the cube. We already know the flux through the
right face (&r $ 36 N#m2/C), the left face (&l $ '12
N?m2/C), and the top face (&t $ 16 N?m2/C).
For the bottom face, our calculation is just like that for
the top face except that the element area vector 
is
now directed downward along the y axis (recall, it must be
outward from the Gaussian enclosure). Thus, we have

'E dA. Now solving Gauss’ law for E and substituting r $
r2 $ 12.00 ( 10'2 m and the new qenc, we find
$ 1.10 ( 10'6N/C.
(Answer) 
Note how different the calculations would have been if
we had put P1 or P2 on the surface of a Gaussian cube in-
stead of mimicking the spherical symmetry with a Gaussian
sphere. Then angle u and magnitude E would have varied
considerably over the surface of the cube and evaluation of
the integral in Gauss’ law would have been difficult.
