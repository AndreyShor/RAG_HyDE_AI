68  GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
accelerated  with  respect  to  the  "  Galileian  space " 
first  considered,  we  can  nevertheless  regard  the  chest 
as  being  at  rest.  We  have  thus  good  grounds  for 
extending  the  principle  of  relativity  to  include  bodies 
of  reference  which  are  accelerated  with  respect  to  each 
other,  and  as  a  result  we  have  gained  a  powerful  argument 
for  a  generalised  postulate  of  relativity. 
We  must  note  carefully  that  the  possibility  of  this 
mode  of  interpretation  rests  on  the  fundamental 
property  of  the  gravitational  field  of  giving  all  bodies 
the  same  acceleration,  or,  what  comes  to  the  same  thing, 
on  the  law  of  the  equality  of  inertial  and  gravitational 
mass.  If  this  natural  law  did  not  exist,  the  man  in 
the  accelerated  chest  would  not  be  able  to  interpret 
the  behaviour  of  the  bodies  around  him  on  the  supposi 
tion  of  a  gravitational  field,  and  he  would  not  be  justified 
on  the  grounds  of  experience  in  supposing  his  reference- 
body  to  be  "  at  rest." 
Suppose  that  the  man  in  the  chest  fixes  a  rope  to  the 
inner  side  of  the  lid,  and  that  he  attaches  a  body  to  the 
free  end  of  the  rope.  The  result  of  this  will  be  to  stretch 
the  rope  so  that  it  will  hang  "  vertically  "  downwards. 
If  we  ask  for  an  opinion  of  the  cause  of  tension  in  the 
rope,  the  man  in  the  chest  will  say  :  "  The  suspended 
body  experiences  a  downward  force  in  the  gravitational 
field,  and  this  is  neutralised  by  the  tension  of  the  rope  ; 
what  determines  the  magnitude  of  the  tension  of  the 
rope  is  the  gravitational  mass  of  the  suspended  body." 
On  the  other  hand,  an  observer  who  is  poised  freely  in 
space  will  interpret  the  condition  of  things  thus  :  "  The 
rope  must  perforce  take  part  in  the  accelerated  motion 
of  the  chest,  and  it  transmits  this  motion  to  the  body 
attached  to  it.  The  tension  of  the  rope  is  just  large
