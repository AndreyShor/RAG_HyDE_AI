In Fig. 28-30, a charged particle
enters a uniform magnetic field 
with speed v0, moves through a half-
circle in time T0, and then leaves the
field. (a) Is the charge positive or
negative? (b) Is the final speed of
the particle greater than, less than,
or equal to v0? (c) If the initial speed
had been 0.5v0, would the time spent in field 
have been greater
than, less than, or equal to T0? (d) Would the path have been a
half-circle, more than a half-circle, or less than a half-circle?

CHAPTER 28
MAGNETIC FIELDS
5
In Module 28-2, we discussed a charged particle moving
through crossed fields with the forces 
and 
in opposition. We
found that the particle moves in a straight line (that is, neither
force dominates the motion) if its speed is given by Eq. 28-7 (v !
E/B). Which of the two forces dominates if the speed of the parti-
cle is (a) v + E/B and (b) v , E/B?

Figure 28-26 shows crossed uniform electric and magnetic
fields 
and 
and, at a certain instant, the velocity vectors of the
10 charged particles listed in Table 28-3. (The vectors are not
drawn to scale.) The speeds given in the table are either less than
or greater than E/B (see Question 5). Which particles will move
out of the page toward you after the instant shown in Fig. 28-26?

Figure 28-27 shows the path of an
electron that passes through two regions
containing uniform magnetic fields of
magnitudes B1 and B2. Its path in each
region is a half-circle. (a) Which field is
stronger? (b) What is the direction of
each field? (c) Is the time spent by the
electron in the 
region greater than,
less than, or the same as the time spent
in the 
region?

Figure 28-28 shows the path of
an electron in a region of uniform
magnetic field. The path consists of
two straight sections, each between
a pair of uniformly charged plates,
and two half-circles. Which plate is
at the higher electric potential in (a)
the top pair of plates and (b) the
bottom pair? (c) What is the direction of the magnetic field?

(a) In Checkpoint 5, if the dipole moment 
is rotated from ori-
entation 2 to orientation 1 by an external agent, is the work done
on the dipole by the agent positive, negative, or zero? (b) Rank the
work done on the dipole by the agent for these three rotations,
greatest first: 2 : 1, 2 : 4, 2 : 3.

Particle roundabout. Figure 28-29 shows 11 paths through a
region of uniform magnetic field. One path is a straight line; the
rest are half-circles. Table 28-4 gives the masses, charges, and
speeds of 11 particles that take these paths through the field in the
directions shown. Which path in the figure corresponds to which

Figure 28-31 gives snapshots for three situations in which a
positively charged particle passes through a uniform magnetic field
. The velocities 
of the particle differ in orientation in the three
snapshots but not in magnitude. Rank the situations according to
(a) the period, (b) the frequency, and (c) the pitch of the particleâ€™s
motion, greatest first.
