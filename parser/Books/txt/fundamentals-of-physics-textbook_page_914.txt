CHAPTER 30
INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE
We can write this as
dUB ! Li di.
Integrating yields
or
(magnetic energy),
(30-49)
which represents the total energy stored by an inductor L carrying a current i.
Note the similarity in form between this expression for the energy stored in a
magnetic field and the expression for the energy stored in an electric field by a
capacitor with capacitance C and charge q; namely,
(30-50)
(The variable i2 corresponds to q2, and the constant L corresponds to 1/C.)

be satisfied? Using Eq. 30-49 twice allows us to rewrite this
energy condition as
or
(30-52)
This equation tells us that, as the current increases from its
initial value of 0 to its final value of i., the magnetic field
will have half its final stored energy when the current has in-
creased to this value. In general, we know that i is given by
Eq. 30-41, and here i. (see Eq. 30-51) is #/R; so Eq. 30-52
becomes
By canceling #/R and rearranging, we can write this as
which yields
or

(Answer)
Thus, the energy stored in the magnetic field of the coil by
the current will reach half its equilibrium value 1.2 time 
constants after the emf is applied.

A coil has an inductance of 53 mH and a resistance of
0.35 1.
(a) If a 12 V emf is applied across the coil, how much energy
is stored in the magnetic field after the current has built up
to its equilibrium value?
KEY IDEA
The energy stored in the magnetic field of a coil at any time
depends on the current through the coil at that time, accord-
ing to Eq. 30-49 
.
Calculations: Thus, to find the energy UB. stored at equi-
librium, we must first find the equilibrium current. From
Eq. 30-41, the equilibrium current is
(30-51)
Then substitution yields
(Answer)
(b) After how many time constants will half this equilibrium
energy be stored in the magnetic field?
Calculations: Now we are being asked: At what time t will
