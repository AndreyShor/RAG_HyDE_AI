unit-vector notation, what is the

ture C if the circular section (a) lies
in the plane of the page as shown
and (b) is perpendicular to the plane
of the page after being rotated 90°

Figure 29-49 shows two

tion) that each carry a current of

Figure 29-50a shows, in cross section, two long, parallel
wires carrying current and separated by distance L. The ratio i1/i2
of their currents is 4.00; the directions of the currents are not indi-
cated. Figure 29-50b shows the y component By of their net mag-
netic field along the x axis to the right of wire 2.The vertical scale is
set by Bys ! 4.0 nT, and the horizontal scale is set by xs ! 20.0 cm.

the value of that maximum? What is the direction (into or out of the

initial orientation?

In Fig. 29-55, two long straight
wires (shown in cross section) carry
the currents i1 ! 30.0 mA and i2 !

Figure 29-52 shows, in cross
section, four thin wires that are paral-

semi-infinite straight sections, both tan-
gent to the same circle, are connected
by a circular arc that has a central angle
radial lengths; it carries current i1 ! 0.50 A in the direction
indicated. Wire 2, shown in cross section, is long, straight, and per-
pendicular to the plane of the figure. Its distance from the center of
the arc is equal to the radius R of the arc, and it carries a current i2
that can be varied.The two currents set up a net magnetic field 
at
the center of the arc. Figure 29-54b gives the square of the field’s
