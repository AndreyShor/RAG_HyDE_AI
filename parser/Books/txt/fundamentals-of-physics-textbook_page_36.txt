Five clocks are being tested in a laboratory. Exactly at
noon, as determined by the WWV time signal, on successive days
of a week the clocks read as in the following table. Rank the five
clocks according to their relative value as good timekeepers, best
to worst. Justify your choice.

Because Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing, the length of
each day increases:The day at the end of 1.0 century is 1.0 ms longer
than the day at the start of the century. In 20 centuries, what is the
total of the daily increases in time?

Suppose that, while lying on a beach near the equator
watching the Sun set over a calm ocean, you start a stopwatch just
as the top of the Sun disappears. You then stand, elevating your
eyes by a height H " 1.70 m, and stop the watch when the top of
the Sun again disappears. If the elapsed time is t " 11.1 s, what is
the radius r of Earth?

Mass

The record for the largest glass bottle was set in 1992 by a
team in Millville, New Jersey—they blew a bottle with a volume of
193 U.S. fluid gallons. (a) How much short of 1.0 million cubic cen-
timeters is that? (b) If the bottle were filled with water at the
leisurely rate of 1.8 g/min, how long would the filling take? Water
has a density of 1000 kg/m3.
•21
Earth has a mass of 5.98 ' 1024 kg.The average mass of the atoms
that make up Earth is 40 u.How many atoms are there in Earth?
•22
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile
metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long
fiber. (a) If a sample of gold, with a mass of 27.63 g, is pressed into
a leaf of 1.000 mm thickness, what is the area of the leaf? (b) If,
instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500
mm, what is the length of the fiber?
•23
(a) Assuming that water has a density of exactly 1 g/cm3,
find the mass of one cubic meter of water in kilograms.
(b) Suppose that it takes 10.0 h to drain a container of 5700 m3 of
water.What is the “mass flow rate,” in kilograms per second, of wa-
ter from the container?
••24
Grains of fine California beach sand are approximately
spheres with an average radius of 50
m and are made of silicon
dioxide, which has a density of 2600 kg/m3.What mass of sand grains
would have a total surface area (the total area of all the individual
spheres) equal to the surface area of a cube 1.00 m on an edge?
••25
During heavy rain, a section of a mountainside mea-
suring 2.5 km horizontally, 0.80 km up along the slope, and 2.0 m
deep slips into a valley in a mud slide.Assume that the mud ends up
uniformly distributed over a surface area of the valley measuring
0.40 km ' 0.40 km and that mud has a density of 1900 kg/m3. What
is the mass of the mud sitting above a 4.0 m2 area of the valley floor?

One cubic centimeter of a typical cumulus cloud contains
50 to 500 water drops, which have a typical radius of 10 mm. For

that range, give the lower value and the higher value, respectively,
for the following. (a) How many cubic meters of water are in a
cylindrical cumulus cloud of height 3.0 km and radius 1.0 km? (b)
How many 1-liter pop bottles would that water fill? (c) Water has
a density of 1000 kg/m3. How much mass does the water in the
cloud have?
••27
Iron has a density of 7.87 g/cm3, and the mass of an iron atom
is 9.27 ' 10$26 kg. If the atoms are spherical and tightly packed, (a)
what is the volume of an iron atom and (b) what is the distance be-
tween the centers of adjacent atoms?
••28
A mole of atoms is 6.02 ' 1023 atoms. To the nearest order
of magnitude, how many moles of atoms are in a large domestic
cat? The masses of a hydrogen atom, an oxygen atom, and a carbon
atom are 1.0 u, 16 u, and 12 u, respectively. (Hint: Cats are some-
times known to kill a mole.)

On a spending spree in Malaysia, you buy an ox with
a weight of 28.9 piculs in the local unit of weights: 1 picul "
100 gins, 1 gin " 16 tahils, 1 tahil " 10 chees, and 1 chee "
10 hoons. The weight of 1 hoon corresponds to a mass of 0.3779 g.
When you arrange to ship the ox home to your astonished family,
how much mass in kilograms must you declare on the shipping
manifest? (Hint: Set up multiple chain-link conversions.)

Water is poured into a container that has a small leak.
The mass m of the water is given as a function of time t by
m " 5.00t0.8 $ 3.00t # 20.00, with t , 0, m in grams, and t in sec-
onds. (a) At what time is the water mass greatest, and (b) what is
that greatest mass? In kilograms per minute, what is the rate of
mass change at (c) t " 2.00 s and (d) t " 5.00 s?

A vertical container with base area measuring 14.0 cm by
17.0 cm is being filled with identical pieces of candy, each with a
volume of 50.0 mm3 and a mass of 0.0200 g.Assume that the volume
of the empty spaces between the candies is negligible. If the height
of the candies in the container increases at the rate of 0.250 cm/s, at
what rate (kilograms per minute) does the mass of the candies in
the container increase?
Additional Problems

In the United States, a doll house has the scale of 1!12 of a
real house (that is, each length of the doll house is 
that of the real
house) and a miniature house (a doll house to fit within a doll
house) has the scale of 1!144 of a real house. Suppose a real house
(Fig. 1-7) has a front length of 20 m, a depth of 12 m, a height of 6.0 m,
and a standard sloped roof (vertical triangular faces on the ends)
of height 3.0 m. In cubic meters, what are the volumes of the corre-
sponding (a) doll house and (b) miniature house?
