39.27 Discuss nanocrystallites as being electron traps and ex-
plain how their threshold wavelength can determine their color.
39.28 Identify quantum dots and quantum corrals.
39.29 For a given state of an electron in an infinite potential
well with two or three dimensions, write equations for the
wave function and probability density and then calculate the
probability of detection for a given range in the well.
39.30 For a given state of an electron in an infinite potential
well with two or three dimensions, calculate the allowed 
energies and draw an energy-level diagram, complete
with labels for the quantum numbers, the ground state,
and several excited states.
39.31 Identify degenerate states. 
39.32 Calculate the energy that an electron must absorb or
emit to move between the allowed states in a 2D or 3D trap.
39.33 If a quantum jump involves light, apply the relationships
between the energy change and the frequency and wave-
length associated with the photon.

Key Ideas
from which we find
(Answer)
Thus,if l ! 2.94 nm,the electron just barely escapes.
(b) Can the ground-state electron absorb light with l !
2.00 nm? If so, what then is the electron’s energy?
KEY IDEAS
1. In (a) we found that light of 2.94 nm will just barely free
the electron from the potential well.
2. We are now considering light with a shorter wavelength of
2.00 nm and thus a greater energy per photon (hf ! hc/l).
3. Hence, the electron can absorb a photon of this light. The

energy transfer will not only free the electron but will also
provide it with more kinetic energy. Further, because the
electron is then no longer trapped, its energy is not
quantized.
More than escaping: The energy transferred to the elec-
tron is the photon energy:
From (a), the energy required to just barely free the electron
from the potential well is U0 # E1 (! 423 eV).The remainder
of the 622 eV goes to kinetic energy.Thus, the kinetic energy
of the freed electron is

More Electron Traps
Here we discuss three types of artificial electron traps.
Nanocrystallites
Perhaps the most direct way to construct a potential energy well in the laboratory
is to prepare a sample of a semiconducting material in the form of a powder
