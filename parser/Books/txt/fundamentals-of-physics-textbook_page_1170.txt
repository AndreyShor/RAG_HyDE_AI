RELATIVITY

A rod is to move at constant
speed v along the x axis of reference
frame S, with the rod’s length parallel
to that axis.An observer in frame S is
to measure the length L of the rod.
Which of the curves in Fig. 37-15 best
gives length L (vertical axis of the
graph) versus speed parameter b?

Figure 37-16 shows a ship (at-
tached to reference frame S#) pass-
ing us (standing in reference frame
S). A proton is fired at nearly the
speed of light along the length of the
ship, from the front to the rear. (a) Is
the spatial separation 2x# between the point at which the proton is
fired and the point at which it hits the ship’s rear wall a positive or
negative quantity? (b) Is the temporal separation 2t# between
those events a positive or negative quantity?

detector move directly relative to each other, the wavelength of
the light as measured in the rest frame of the source is the proper
wavelength l0. The detected wavelength l is either longer (a red
shift) or shorter (a blue shift) depending on whether the
source–detector separation is increasing or decreasing. When the
separation is increasing, the wavelengths are related by
(source and detector separating),
(37-32)
where b ! v/c and v is the relative radial speed (along a line con-
necting the source and detector). If the separation is decreasing, the
signs in front of the b symbols are reversed. For speeds much less
than c,the magnitude of the Doppler wavelength shift (2l ! l & l0)
is approximately related to v by
(v 5 c).

Transverse Doppler Effect
If the relative motion of the light
source is perpendicular to a line joining the source and detector,
the detected frequency f is related to the proper frequency f0 by

Momentum and Energy
The following definitions of linear
momentum , kinetic energy K, and total energy E for a particle of
mass m are valid at any physically possible speed:
(momentum),
(37-42)
E ! mc 2 ' K ! gmc 2
(total energy),
(37-47, 37-48)
K ! mc 2(g & 1)
(kinetic energy).
(37-52)
Here g is the Lorentz factor for the particle’s motion, and mc2 is
the mass energy, or rest energy, associated with the mass of the par-
ticle.These equations lead to the relationships
(pc)2 ! K 2 ' 2Kmc2
(37-54)
and
E2 ! (pc)2 ' (mc2)2.
(37-55)
When a system of particles undergoes a chemical or nuclear
reaction, the Q of the reaction is the negative of the change in the
system’s total mass energy:
Q ! Mic2 & Mfc2 ! &2M c2,
(37-50)
where Mi is the system’s total mass before the reaction and Mf is its
total mass after the reaction.

Reference frame S# is to pass reference frame S at speed v
along the common direction of the x# and x axes, as in Fig. 37-9.An
observer who rides along with frame S# is to count off 25 s on his
wristwatch. The corresponding time interval 2t is to be measured
by an observer in frame S. Which of the curves in Fig. 37-15 best
gives 2t (vertical axis of the graph) versus
speed parameter b?

Figure 37-17 shows two clocks in sta-
tionary frame S# (they are synchronized in
that frame) and one clock in moving frame
S. Clocks C1 and 
read zero when they
pass each other. When clocks C1 and
pass each other, (a) which clock has the
smaller reading and (b) which clock mea-
sures a proper time?

Figure 37-18 shows two clocks in stationary
frame S (they are synchronized in that frame)
and one clock in moving frame S#.Clocks C1 and
read zero when they pass each other. When
clocks 
and C2 pass each other, (a) which
clock has the smaller reading and (b) which
clock measures a proper time?

Sam leaves Venus in a spaceship headed to
Mars and passes Sally, who is on Earth, with a
relative speed of 0.5c. (a) Each measures the Venus–Mars voyage
time. Who measures a proper time:
Sam, Sally, or neither? (b) On the
way, Sam sends a pulse of light to
Mars. Each measures the travel time
of the pulse. Who measures a proper
time:Sam,Sally,or neither?

ing rods in Fig. 37-19 is like that in
