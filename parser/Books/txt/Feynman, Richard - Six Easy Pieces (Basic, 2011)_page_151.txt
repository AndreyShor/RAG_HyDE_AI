An experiment with waves
Now we wish to consider an experiment with water waves. The ap-
paratus is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 6-2. We have a shallow
trough of water. A small object labeled the “wave source” is jiggled
up and down by a motor and makes circular waves. To the right of
the source we have again a wall with two holes, and beyond that is
a second wall, which, to keep things simple, is an “absorber,” so
that there is no reﬂection of the waves that arrive there. This can
be done by building a gradual sand “beach.” In front of the beach
we place a detector which can be moved back and forth in the x-
direction, as before. The detector is now a device which measures
the “intensity” of the wave motion. You can imagine a gadget which
measures the height of the wave motion, but whose scale is cali-
brated in proportion to the square of the actual height, so that the
reading is proportional to the intensity of the wave. Our detector
reads, then, in proportion to the energy being carried by the wave—
or rather, the rate at which energy is carried to the detector.
With our wave apparatus, the ﬁrst thing to notice is that the in-
tensity can have any size. If the source just moves a very small
