During  the  interval  1909  to  1911  he  occupied  the  post 
of  Professor  Extraor  dinar  ius  at  the  University  of  Zurich, 
afterwards  being  appointed  to  the  University  of  Prague, 
Bohemia,  where  he  remained  as  Professor  Ordinarius 
until  1912.  In  the  latter  year  Professor  Einstein 
accepted  a  similar  chair  at  the  Polytechnikum,  Zurich, 
and  continued  his  activities  there  until  1914,  when  he 
received  a  call  to  the  Prussian  Academy  of  Science, 
Berlin,  as  successor  to  Van't  Hoff.  Professor  Einstein 
is  able  to  devote  himself  freely  to  his  studies  at  the 
Berlin  Academy,  and  it  was  here  that  he  succeeded  in 
completing  his  work  on  the  General  Theory  of  Relativity 
(1915-17).  Professor  Einstein  also  lectures  on  various 
special  branches  of  physics  at  the  University  of  Berlin, 
and,  in  addition,  he  is  Director  of  the  Institute  for 
Physical  Research  of  the  Kaiser  Wilhelm  Gesellschaft. 
Professor  Einstein  has  been  twice  married.  His  first 
wife,  whom  he  married  at  Berne  in  10,03,  was  a  fellow- 
student  from  Serbia.  There  were  two  sons  of  this 
marriage,  both  of  whom  are  living  in  Zurich,  the  elder 
being  sixteen  years  of  age.  Recently  Professor  Einstein 
married  a  widowed  cousin,  with  whom  he  is  now  living 
in  Berlin.
