Figure 38-13 shows that because of Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle, it is not possible to assign an x coordinate to the position
of a free electron moving along an x axis. (a) Can you assign a y or
a z coordinate? (Hint: The momentum of the electron has no y or z
component.) (b) Describe the extent of the matter wave in three
