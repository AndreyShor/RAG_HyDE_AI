Figure 29-24 shows three circuits, each consisting of two radial
lengths and two concentric circular arcs, one of radius r and the
other of radius R , r. The circuits have the same current through
them and the same angle between the two radial lengths. Rank the
circuits according to the magnitude of the net magnetic field at the
center, greatest first.
of radii r, 2r, and 3r). The circuits carry the same current. Rank
them according to the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at
the center of curvature (the dot), greatest first.

Figure 29-29 gives, as a function of radial distance r, the magni-
tude B of the magnetic field inside and outside four wires (a, b, c,and
d),each of which carries a current that is uniformly distributed across
the wire’s cross section. Overlapping portions of the plots (drawn
slightly separated) are indicated by double labels. Rank the wires ac-
cording to (a) radius, (b) the magnitude of the magnetic field on the
surface, and (c) the value of the current, greatest first. (d) Is the mag-
nitude of the current density in wire a greater than,less than,or equal
to that in wire c?

Figure 29-25 represents a snap-
shot of the velocity vectors of four
electrons near a wire carrying cur-
rent i. The four velocities have the
same magnitude; velocity 
is di-
rected into the page. Electrons 1 and
2 are at the same distance from the
wire, as are electrons 3 and 4. Rank
the electrons according to the mag-
nitudes of the magnetic forces on
them due to current i, greatest first.

Figure 29-26 shows four arrangements in which long parallel wires
carry equal currents directly into or out of the page at the corners of
identical squares. Rank the arrangements according to the magnitude
of the net magnetic field at the center of the square,greatest first.

Figure 29-30 shows four circular
Amperian loops (a, b, c, d) concentric
with a wire whose current is directed
out of the page. The current is uniform
across the wire’s circular cross section
(the shaded region). Rank the loops ac-
cording to the magnitude of

Figure 29-27 shows cross sections
of two long straight wires; the left-
hand wire carries current i1 directly
out of the page. If the net magnetic
field due to the two currents is to be zero at point P, (a) should the
direction of current i2 in the right-hand wire be directly into or out of
the page and (b) should i2 be greater than,less than,or equal to i1?
