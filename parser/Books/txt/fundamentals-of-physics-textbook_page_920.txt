CHAPTER 30
INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE
8
The switch in the circuit of 
Fig. 30-15 has been closed on a for a
very long time when it is then
thrown to b. The resulting current
through the inductor is indicated in
Fig. 30-28 for four sets of values for
the resistance R and inductance L:
(1) R0 and L0, (2) 2R0 and L0, (3) R0
and 2L0, (4) 2R0 and 2L0.Which set
goes with which curve?

Figure 30-29 shows three circuits
with identical batteries, inductors,
and resistors. Rank the circuits,
greatest first, according to the current through the resistor labeled
R (a) long after the switch is closed, (b) just after the switch is
reopened a long time later, and (c) long after it is reopened.

Figure 30-30 gives the variation
with time of the potential difference
VR across a resistor in three circuits
wired as shown in Fig. 30-16.The cir-
cuits contain the same resistance R
and emf # but differ in the induc-
tance L. Rank the circuits according
to the value of L,greatest first.

Figure 30-25 shows a circular region in which a decreasing uni-
form magnetic field is directed out of the page, as well as four con-
centric circular paths. Rank the paths according to the magnitude
of 
evaluated along them, greatest first.

tion, rank the choices according to (a)
the work done per unit charge in set-
ting up the induced current and (b) that
induced current, greatest first. (c) For
each choice, what is the direction of the
induced current in the figure?

Figure 30-27 shows a circuit with
two identical resistors and an ideal in-
ductor. Is the current through the cen-
tral resistor more than, less than, or the same as that through the
other resistor (a) just after the closing of switch S, (b) a long time
after that, (c) just after S is reopened a long time later, and (d) a
long time after that?
axis, which is directed out of the plane of the figure. Figure 30-
22b gives the z components Bz of the fields versus time t. (Plots 1
and 3 are parallel; so are plots 4 and 6. Plots 2 and 5 are parallel
to the time axis.) Rank the six plots according to the emf induced
in the loop, greatest clockwise emf first, greatest counterclock-
wise emf last.

In Fig. 30-23, a long straight wire with current i passes (without
touching) three rectangular wire loops with edge lengths L, 1.5L,
and 2L. The loops are widely spaced (so as not to affect one an-
other). Loops 1 and 3 are symmetric about the long wire. Rank the
loops according to the size of the current induced in them if cur-
rent i is (a) constant and (b) increasing, greatest first.

Figure 30-24 shows two circuits in which a conducting bar is slid
at the same speed v through the same uniform magnetic field and
along a U-shaped wire. The parallel lengths of the wire are sepa-
rated by 2L in circuit 1 and by L in circuit 2.The current induced in
circuit 1 is counterclockwise. (a) Is the magnetic field into or out of
the page? (b) Is the current induced in circuit 2 clockwise or coun-
terclockwise? (c) Is the emf induced in circuit 1 larger than, smaller
than, or the same as that in circuit 2?

In Fig. 30-26, a wire loop has been bent so that it has three seg-
ments: segment bc (a quarter-circle), ac (a square corner), and ab
(straight). Here are three choices for a magnetic field through the
loop:
