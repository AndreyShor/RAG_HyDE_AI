104    GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
Apart  from  this  one,  it  has  hitherto  been  possible  to 
make  only  two  deductions  from  the  theory  which  admit 
of  being  tested  by  observation,  to  wit,  the  curvature 
of  light  rays  by  the  gravitational  field  of  the  sun,1 
and  a  displacement  of  the  spectral  lines  of  light  reaching 
us  from  large  stars,  as  compared  with  the  corresponding 
lines  for  light  produced  in  an  analogous  manner  terres 
trially  (i.e.  by  the  same  kind  of  molecule).  I  do  not 
doubt  that  these  deductions  from  the  theory  will  be 
confirmed  also. 
1  Observed  by  Eddington  and  others  in  1919.  (Cf.  Appendix 
III.)
