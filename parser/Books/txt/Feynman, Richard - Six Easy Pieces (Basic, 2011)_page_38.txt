vessel for holding gases (used in all textbooks), a cylinder with a
piston in it. Now, it makes no difference what the shapes of water
molecules are, so for simplicity we shall draw them as tennis balls
or little dots. These things are in perpetual motion in all directions.
So many of them are hitting the top piston all the time that to keep
it from being patiently knocked out of the tank by this continuous
banging, we shall have to hold the piston down by a certain force,
which we call the pressure (really, the pressure times the area is the
force). Clearly, the force is proportional to the area, for if we in-
crease the area but keep the number of molecules per cubic cen-
timeter the same, we increase the number of collisions with the
piston in the same proportion as the area was increased.
Now let us put twice as many molecules in this tank, so as to
double the density, and let them have the same speed, i.e., the same
