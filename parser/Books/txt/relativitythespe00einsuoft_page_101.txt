EUCLIDEAN  AND  NON-EUCLIDEAN  CONTINUUM 
THE  surface  of  a  marble  table  is  spread  out  in  front 
of  me.  I  can  get  from  any  one  point  on  this 
table  to  any  other  point  by  passing  continuously 
from  one  point  to  a  "  neighbouring  "  one,  and  repeating 
this  process  a  (large)  number  of  times,  or,  in  other  words, 
by  going  from  point  to  point  without  executing  "  jumps." 
I  am  sure  the  reader  will  appreciate  with  sufficient 
clearness  what  I  mean  here  by  "  neighbouring  "  and  by 
"  jumps  "  (if  he  is  not  too  pedantic).  We  express  this 
property  of  the  surface  by  describing  the  latter  as  a 
continuum. 
Let  us  now  imagine  that  a  large  number  of  little  rods 
of  equal  length  have  been  made,  their  lengths  being 
small  compared  with  the  dimensions  of  the  marble 
slab.  When  I  say  they  are  of  equal  length,  I  mean  that 
one  can  be  laid  on  any  other  without  the  ends  over 
lapping.  We  next  lay  four  of  these  little  rods  on  the 
marble  slab  so  that  they  constitute  a  quadrilateral 
figure  (a  square),  the  diagonals  of  which  are  equally 
long.  To  ensure  the  equality  of  the  diagonals,  we  make 
use  of  a  little  testing-rod.  To  this  square  we  add 
similar  ones,  each  of  which  has  one  rod  in  common 
with  the  first.  We  proceed  in  like  manner  with  each  of 
these  squares  until  finally  the  whole  marble  slab  is
