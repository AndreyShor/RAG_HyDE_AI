CHAPTER 18
TEMPERATURE, HEAT, AND THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

Figure 18-42 represents a
closed cycle for a gas (the figure is not
drawn to scale).The change in the inter-
nal energy of the gas as it moves from a
to c along the path abc is $200 J.
As it moves from c to d, 180 J must be
transferred to it as heat. An additional
transfer of 80 J to it as heat is needed as
it moves from d to a. How much work is
done on the gas as it moves from c to d?
••50
A lab sample of gas is taken
through cycle abca shown in the p-V
diagram of Fig. 18-43. The net work
done is "1.2 J. Along path ab, the
change in the internal energy is "3.0 J
and the magnitude of the work done
is 5.0 J. Along path ca, the energy
transferred to the gas as heat is "2.5
J. How much energy is transferred as
heat along (a) path ab and (b) path bc?
a beehive, several hundred of the bees quickly form a compact
ball around the hornet to stop it. They don’t sting, bite, crush, or
suffocate it. Rather they overheat it by quickly raising their body
temperatures from the normal 35 C to 47 C or 48 C, which is
lethal to the hornet but not to the bees (Fig. 18-44). Assume the
following: 500 bees form a ball of radius R # 2.0 cm for a time t #
20 min, the primary loss of energy by the ball is by thermal radia-
tion, the ball’s surface has emissivity ´ # 0.80, and the ball has a
uniform temperature. On average, how much additional energy
must each bee produce during the 20 min to maintain 47 C?

(a) What is the rate of energy loss in watts per square meter
through a glass window 3.0 mm thick if the outside temperature is
$20 F and the inside temperature is "72 F? (b) A storm window
having the same thickness of glass is installed parallel to the first
window, with an air gap of 7.5 cm between the two windows. What
now is the rate of energy loss if conduction is the only important
energy-loss mechanism?

A solid cylinder of radius r1 # 2.5 cm, length h1 # 5.0 cm,
emissivity 0.85, and temperature 30 C is suspended in an environ-
ment of temperature 50 C. (a) What is the cylinder’s net thermal
radiation transfer rate P1? (b) If the cylinder is stretched until its
radius is r2 # 0.50 cm, its net thermal radiation transfer rate be-
comes P2.What is the ratio P2/P1?

A sphere of radius 0.500 m, temperature 27.0 C, and emissiv-
ity 0.850 is located in an environment of temperature 77.0 C. At
what rate does the sphere (a) emit and (b) absorb thermal radia-
tion? (c) What is the sphere’s net rate of energy exchange?

The ceiling of a single-family dwelling in a cold climate
should have an R-value of 30. To give such insulation, how thick
would a layer of (a) polyurethane foam and (b) silver have to be?

If you were to walk briefly in space without a spacesuit
while far from the Sun (as an astronaut does in the movie 2001, A
Space Odyssey), you would feel the cold of space—while you radi-
ated energy, you would absorb almost none from your environ-
ment. (a) At what rate would you lose energy? (b) How much en-
ergy would you lose in 30 s? Assume that your emissivity is 0.90,
and estimate other data needed in the calculations.

A cylindrical copper rod of length 1.2 m and cross-sectional
area 4.8 cm2 is insulated along its side.The ends are held at a temper-
ature difference of 100 C by having one end in a water–ice mixture
and the other in a mixture of boiling water and steam. At what rate
(a) is energy conducted by the rod and (b) does the ice melt?

In Fig. 18-45a, two identical rec-
tangular rods of metal are welded end
to end, with a temperature of T1 # 0 C
on the left side and a temperature 
of T2 # 100 C on the right side. In 
2.0 min, 10 J is conducted at a constant
rate from the right side to the left side.
How much time would be required to
conduct 10 J if the rods were welded
side to side as in Fig. 18-45b?

the temperature difference %T2

instead, equal to 1.1k1, (b) would
the rate at which energy is con-
ducted through the wall be greater
than, less than, or the same as pre-
viously, and (c) what would be the
value of %T2?
