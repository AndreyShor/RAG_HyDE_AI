point particles are fixed on an x axis sepa-
rated by distance d. Particle A has mass mA
and particle B has mass 3.00mA. A third
particle C, of mass 75.0mA, is to be placed
on the x axis and near particles A and B. In
terms of distance d, at what x coordinate
should C be placed so that the net gravita-
tional force on particle A from particles B
and C is zero?

The Sun and Earth each exert a gravitational force on the

Miniature black holes. Left over from the big-bang beginning
of the universe, tiny black holes might still wander through the 
universe. If one with a mass of 1 $ 1011 kg (and a radius of only 
1 $ 10%16 m) reached Earth, at what distance from your head
would its gravitational pull on you match that of Earth’s?

Figure 13-38 shows a spherical
hollow inside a lead sphere of radius
R ! 4.00 cm; the surface of the hol-
low passes through the center of the
sphere and “touches”
the right
side of the sphere. The mass of the
sphere before hollowing was M !
2.95 kg.
With what gravitational
force does the hollowed-out lead sphere attract a small sphere
of mass m ! 0.431 kg that lies at a distance d ! 9.00 cm from
the center of the lead sphere, on the straight line connecting the
centers of the spheres and of the hollow?
