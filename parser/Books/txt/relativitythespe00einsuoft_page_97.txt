BEHAVIOUR  OF  CLOCKS  AND  MEASURING-RODS 
ON  A  ROTATING  BODY  OF  REFERENCE 
HITHERTO  I  have  purposely  refrained  from 
speaking  about  the  physical  interpretation  of 
space-  and  time-data  in  the  case  of  the  general 
theory  of  relativity.  As  a  consequence,  I  am  guilty  of  a 
certain  slovenliness  of  treatment,  which,  as  we  know 
from  the  special  theory  of  relativity,  is  far  from  being 
unimportant  and  pardonable.  It  is  now  high  time  that 
we  remedy  this  defect;  but  I  would  mention  at  the 
outset,  that  this  matter  lays  no  small  claims  on  the 
patience  and  on  the  power  of  abstraction  of  the  reader. 
We  start  off  again  from  quite  special  cases,  which  we 
have  frequently  used  before.  Let  us  consider  a  space- 
time  domain  in  which  no  gravitational  field  exists 
relative  to  a  reference-body  K  whose  state  of  motion 
has  been  suitably  chosen.  K  is  then  a  Galileian  refer 
ence-body  as  regards  the  domain  considered,  and  the 
results  of  the  special  theory  of  relativity  hold  relative 
to  K.  Let  us  suppose  the  same  domain  referred  to  a 
second  body  of  reference  K',  which  is  rotating  uniformly 
with  respect  to  K.  In  order  to  fix  our  ideas,  we  shall 
imagine  K'  to  be  in  the  form  of  a  plane  circular  disc, 
which  rotates  uniformly  in  its  own  plane  about  its 
centre.  An  observer  who  is  sitting  eccentrically  on  the
