CHAPTER 36
DIFFRACTION
X-Ray Diffraction
X rays are electromagnetic radiation whose wavelengths are of the order of 1 Å
(! 10&10 m). Compare this with a wavelength of 550 nm (! 5.5 ( 10&7 m) at the
●If x rays are directed toward a crystal structure, they
undergo Bragg scattering, which is easiest to visualize if
the crystal atoms are considered to be in parallel planes.

with separation d, the angles u at which the scattered
intensity is maximum are given by

(Bragg’s law).
KEY IDEAS
(1) The angular separation 2u between the two lines in the
first order depends on their wavelength difference 2l and
the dispersion D of the grating, according to Eq. 36-29 
(D ! 2u/2l). (2) The dispersion D depends on the angle u
at which it is to be evaluated.
Calculations: We can assume that, in the first order, the
two sodium lines occur close enough to each other for us to
evaluate D at the angle u
16.99° we found in part (a) for
one of those lines.Then Eq. 36-30 gives the dispersion as
From Eq. 36-29 and with 2l in nanometers, we then have

You can show that this result depends on the grating spacing
d but not on the number of rulings there are in the grating.

(c) What is the least number of rulings a grating can have
and still be able to resolve the sodium doublet in the first
order?
KEY IDEAS
(1) The resolving power of a grating in any order m is physi-
cally set by the number of rulings N in the grating 
according to Eq. 36-32 (R ! Nm). (2) The smallest wave-
length difference 2l that can be resolved depends on the
average wavelength involved and on the resolving power R
of the grating, according to Eq. 36-31 (R ! lavg/2l).
Calculation: For the sodium doublet to be barely resolved,
2l must be their wavelength separation of 0.59 nm, and lavg
must be their average wavelength of 589.30 nm. Thus, we
find that the smallest number of rulings for a grating to 
resolve the sodium doublet is

After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
36.38 Identify approximately where x rays are located in the
electromagnetic spectrum.
36.39 Define a unit cell.
36.40 Define reflecting planes (or crystal planes) and
interplanar spacing.
36.41 Sketch two rays that scatter from adjacent planes,
showing the angle that is used in calculations.
36.42 For the intensity maxima in x-ray scattering 
by a crystal, apply the relationship between the 
interplanar spacing d, the angle u of scattering, 
the order number m, and the wavelength l of the 
x rays.
36.43 Given a drawing of a unit cell, demonstrate how an
interplanar spacing can be determined.
