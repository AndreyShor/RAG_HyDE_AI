For the passing reference frames in Fig. 37-25, events A and
B occur at the following spacetime coordinates: according to the
unprimed frame, (xA, tA) and (xB, tB); according to the primed
frame,

reads zero as it passes the origin of the axis. (a) Calculate the
clock’s Lorentz factor. (b) What time does the clock read as it

Bullwinkle in reference frame S# passes you in reference
frame S along the common direction of the x# and x axes, as in
Fig. 37-9. He carries three meter sticks: meter stick 1 is parallel to
the x# axis, meter stick 2 is parallel to the y# axis, and meter stick 3 is
parallel to the z# axis. On his wristwatch he counts off 15.0 s, which
takes 30.0 s according to you. Two events occur during his passage.
According to you, event 1 occurs at x1 ! 33.0 m and t1 ! 22.0 ns,
and event 2 occurs at x2 ! 53.0 m and t2 ! 62.0 ns. According
to your measurements, what is the length of (a) meter stick 1,
(b) meter stick 2, and (c) meter stick 3? According to Bullwinkle,
what are (d) the spatial separation and (e) the temporal separation
between events 1 and 2,and (f) which event occurs first?

In Fig. 37-9, observer S detects two flashes of light. A big
flash occurs at x1 ! 1200 m and, 5.00 ms later, a small flash occurs
at x2 ! 480 m. As detected by observer S#, the two flashes occur at
a single coordinate x#. (a) What is the speed parameter of S#, and
(b) is S# moving in the positive or negative direction of the x axis?
To S#, (c) which flash occurs first and (d) what is the time interval 
between the flashes?
••26
In Fig. 37-9, observer S detects two flashes of light. A big
flash occurs at x1 ! 1200 m and, slightly later, a small flash occurs
at x2 ! 480 m.The time interval between the flashes is 2t ! t2 & t1.
What is the smallest value of 2t for which observer S# will deter-
mine that the two flashes occur at the same x# coordinate?

A particle moves along the x# axis of frame S# with
velocity 0.40c. Frame

frame S?

In Fig. 37-11, frame S# moves relative to frame S with velocity
while a particle moves parallel to the common x and x# axes.
An observer attached to frame S# measures the particle’s velocity
to be 
. In terms of c, what is the particle’s velocity as mea-
sured by an observer attached to frame S according to the (a) rela-
tivistic and (b) classical velocity transformation? Suppose, instead,
that the S# measure of the particle’s velocity is 
. What
velocity does the observer in S now measure according to the
(c) relativistic and (d) classical velocity transformation?

Galaxy A is reported to be receding from us with a speed of
0.35c. Galaxy B, located in precisely the opposite direction, is also
found to be receding from us at this same speed.What multiple of c

for (a) our galaxy and (b) Galaxy B?

Stellar system Q1 moves away from us at a speed of 0.800c.
Stellar system Q2, which lies in the same direction in space but is
closer to us, moves away from us at speed 0.400c.What multiple of

A spaceship whose rest length is 350 m
has a speed of 0.82c with respect to a certain reference frame. A
micrometeorite, also with a speed of 0.82c in this frame, passes the
spaceship on an antiparallel track. How long does it take this ob-
ject to pass the ship as measured on the ship?

An armada of spaceships that is 1.00 ly long (as measured
in its rest frame) moves with speed 0.800c relative to a ground
station in frame S.A messenger travels from the rear of the armada
to the front with a speed of 0.950c relative to S. How long does the
trip take as measured (a) in the rest frame of the messenger, (b) in
the rest frame of the armada, and (c) by an observer in the ground

A sodium light source moves in a horizontal circle at a con-
stant speed of 0.100c while emitting light at the proper wavelength
of l0 ! 589.00 nm. Wavelength l is measured for that light by a
detector fixed at the center of the circle. What is the wavelength
shift l & l0?

receivers be tuned to receive the report?
