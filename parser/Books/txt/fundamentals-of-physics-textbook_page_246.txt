Newton’s Second Law for a System of Particles
Now that we know how to locate the center of mass of a system of particles, we
discuss how external forces can move a center of mass. Let us start with a simple
system of two billiard balls.
If you roll a cue ball at a second billiard ball that is at rest, you expect that the
two-ball system will continue to have some forward motion after impact. You
would be surprised, for example, if both balls came back toward you or if both
moved to the right or to the left. You already have an intuitive sense that some-
thing continues to move forward.
What continues to move forward, its steady motion completely unaf-
fected by the collision, is the center of mass of the two-ball system. If you fo-
cus on this point—which is always halfway between these bodies because
they have identical masses—you can easily convince yourself by trial at a bil-
liard table that this is so. No matter whether the collision is glancing, head-on,
or somewhere in between, the center of mass continues to move forward, as if
the collision had never occurred. Let us look into this center-of-mass motion
in more detail.
Motion of a System’s com. To do so, we replace the pair of billiard balls with
a system of n particles of (possibly) different masses.We are interested not in the
individual motions of these particles but only in the motion of the center of mass
of the system. Although the center of mass is just a point, it moves like a particle
whose mass is equal to the total mass of the system; we can assign a position, a ve-
locity, and an acceleration to it. We state (and shall prove next) that the vector
equation that governs the motion of the center of mass of such a system of parti-
cles is
(system of particles).

This equation is Newton’s second law for the motion of the center of mass of
a system of particles. Note that its form is the same as the form of the equation

9-2 NEWTON’S SECOND LAW FOR A SYSTEM OF PARTICLES
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
9.04 Apply Newton’s second law to a system of particles by re-
lating the net force (of the forces acting on the particles) to
the acceleration of the system’s center of mass.
9.05 Apply the constant-acceleration equations to the motion
of the individual particles in a system and to the motion of
the system’s center of mass.
9.06 Given the mass and velocity of the particles in a system,
calculate the velocity of the system’s center of mass.
9.07 Given the mass and acceleration of the particles in a
system, calculate the acceleration of the system’s center
of mass.
9.08 Given the position of a system’s center of mass as a func-
tion of time, determine the velocity of the center of mass.
9.09 Given the velocity of a system’s center of mass as a
function of time, determine the acceleration of the center
of mass.
9.10 Calculate the change in the velocity of a com by integrat-
ing the com’s acceleration function with respect to time.
9.11 Calculate a com’s displacement by integrating the
com’s velocity function with respect to time.
9.12 When the particles in a two-particle system move with-
out the system’s com moving, relate the displacements of
the particles and the velocities of the particles.
