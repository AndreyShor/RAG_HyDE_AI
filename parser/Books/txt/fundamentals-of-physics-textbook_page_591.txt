19-7 THE MOLAR SPECIFIC HEATS OF AN IDEAL GAS
The internal energy Eint of an ideal gas is a function of the gas temperature only; it
does not depend on any other variable.
With Eq. 19-38 in hand, we are now able to derive an expression for the
molar specific heat of an ideal gas.Actually, we shall derive two expressions. One
is for the case in which the volume of the gas remains constant as energy is trans-
ferred to or from it as heat. The other is for the case in which the pressure of the
gas remains constant as energy is transferred to or from it as heat. The symbols
for these two molar specific heats are CV and Cp, respectively. (By convention, the
capital letter C is used in both cases, even though CV and Cp represent types of
specific heat and not heat capacities.)
Molar Specific Heat at Constant Volume
Figure 19-9a shows n moles of an ideal gas at pressure p and temperature T,
confined to a cylinder of fixed volume V. This initial state i of the gas is
marked on the p-V diagram of Fig. 19-9b. Suppose now that you add a small
amount of energy to the gas as heat Q by slowly turning up the temperature
of the thermal reservoir. The gas temperature rises a small amount to T "
%T, and its pressure rises to p " %p, bringing the gas to final state f. In such
experiments, we would find that the heat Q is related to the temperature
change %T by
Q # nCV %T
(constant volume),
(19-39)
where CV is a constant called the molar specific heat at constant volume. Substi-
tuting this expression for Q into the first law of thermodynamics as given by
Eq. 18-26 (%Eint # Q $ W) yields
%Eint # nCV %T $ W.
(19-40)
With the volume held constant, the gas cannot expand and thus cannot do any
work.Therefore, W # 0, and Eq. 19-40 gives us
(19-41)
From Eq. 19-38, the change in internal energy must be
(19-42)
Substituting this result into Eq. 19-41 yields
(monatomic gas).
(19-43)
As Table 19-2 shows, this prediction of the kinetic theory (for ideal gases) agrees
very well with experiment for real monatomic gases, the case that we have
assumed. The (predicted and) experimental values of CV for diatomic gases
(which have molecules with two atoms) and polyatomic gases (which have mole-
cules with more than two atoms) are greater than those for monatomic gases for
reasons that will be suggested in Module 19-8. Here we make the preliminary as-
sumption that the CV values for diatomic and polyatomic gases are greater than
for monatomic gases because the more complex molecules can rotate and thus
have rotational kinetic energy. So, when Q is transferred to a diatomic or poly-
atomic gas, only part of it goes into the translational kinetic energy, increasing the

Using Eq. 19-7 (k # R/NA), we can rewrite this as
