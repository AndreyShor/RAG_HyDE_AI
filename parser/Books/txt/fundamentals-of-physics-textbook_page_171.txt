In Fig. 6-45, a 1.34 kg
ball is connected by means of two mass-
less strings, each of length L
1.70 m, to
a vertical, rotating rod.The strings are tied
to the rod with separation d " 1.70 m and
are taut. The tension in the upper string is
35 N.What are the (a) tension in the lower
string, (b) magnitude of the net force 
on the ball, and (c) speed of the ball? (d)
What is the direction of

In Fig. 6-49, a 49 kg rock climber is climbing a “chim-
ney.” The coefficient of static friction between her shoes and the
rock is 1.2; between her back and the rock is 0.80. She has reduced
her push against the rock until her back and her shoes are on the
verge of slipping. (a) Draw a free-body diagram of her. (b) What is
the magnitude of her push against the rock? (c) What fraction of
her weight is supported by the frictional force on her shoes?

A block of mass mt " 4.0 kg is put on top of a block of
mass mb
5.0 kg.To cause the top block to slip on the bottom one
while the bottom one is held fixed, a horizontal force of at least 12
N must be applied to the top block. The assembly of blocks is now
placed on a horizontal, frictionless table (Fig. 6-47). Find the mag-
nitudes of (a) the maximum horizontal force 
that can be applied
to the lower block so that the blocks will move together and (b) the
resulting acceleration of the blocks.

A 5.00 kg stone is rubbed across the horizontal ceiling of a
cave passageway (Fig. 6-48). If the coefficient of kinetic friction is
0.65 and the force applied to the stone is angled at u " 70.0°, what
must the magnitude of the force be for the stone to move at constant
velocity?

A high-speed railway car goes around a flat, horizontal circle
of radius 470 m at a constant speed. The magnitudes of the hori-
zontal and vertical components of the force of the car on a 51.0 kg
passenger are 210 N and 500 N, respectively. (a) What is the magni-
tude of the net force (of all the forces) on the passenger? (b) What
is the speed of the car?

Continuation of Problems 8 and 37. Another explana-
tion is that the stones move only when the water dumped on the
playa during a storm freezes into a large, thin sheet of ice. The
stones are trapped in place in the ice. Then, as air flows across
the ice during a wind, the air-drag forces on the ice and stones
move them both, with the stones gouging out the trails.The magni-
tude of the air-drag force on this horizontal “ice sail” is given by
Dice " 4CicerAicev2, where Cice is the drag coefficient (2.0 ' 10$3), r
is the air density (1.21 kg/m3), Aice is the horizontal area of the ice,
and v is the wind speed along the ice.
Assume the following:The ice sheet measures 400 m by 500 m
by 4.0 mm and has a coefficient of kinetic friction of 0.10 with the
ground and a density of 917 kg/m3. Also assume that 100 stones
identical to the one in Problem 8 are trapped in the ice. To main-
tain the motion of the sheet, what are the required wind speeds (a)
near the sheet and (b) at a height of 10 m? (c) Are these reason-
able values for high-speed winds in a storm?

In Fig. 6-50, block 1 of mass m1
2.0 kg and block 2 of
mass m2
3.0 kg are connected by a string of negligible mass and
are initially held in place. Block 2 is on a frictionless surface tilted
at u " 303. The coefficient of kinetic friction between block 1 and
the horizontal surface is 0.25. The pulley has negligible mass and
friction. Once they are released, the blocks move.What then is the
tension in the string?

In Fig. 6-46, a box of ant aunts (total
mass m1 " 1.65 kg) and a box of ant un-
cles (total mass m2 " 3.30 kg) slide down an inclined plane while
attached by a massless rod parallel to the plane. The angle of in-
cline is u " 30.0°. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the
aunt box and the incline is m1 " 0.226; that between the uncle box
and the incline is m2 " 0.113. Compute (a) the tension in the rod
and (b) the magnitude of the common acceleration of the two
boxes. (c) How would the answers to (a) and (b) change if the un-
cles trailed the aunts?
