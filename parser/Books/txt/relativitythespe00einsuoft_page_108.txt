For  example,  this  obviously  holds  in  the  case  of  the 
marble  slab  of  the  table  and  local  variation  of  temperature. 
The  temperature  is  practically  constant  for  a  small 
part  of  the  slab,  and  thus  the  geometrical  behaviour  of 
the  rods  is  almost  as  it  ought  to  be  according  to  the 
rules  of  Euclidean  geometry.  Hence  the  imperfections 
of  the  construction  of  squares  in  the  previous  section 
do  not  show  themselves  clearly  until  this  construction 
is  extended  over  a  considerable  portion  of  the  surface 
of  the  table. 
We  can  sum  this  up  as  follows  :  Gauss  invented  a 
method  for  the  mathematical  treatment  of  continua  in 
general,  in  which  "  size-relations  "  ("  distances  "  between 
neighbouring  points)  are  defined.  To  every  point  of  a 
continuum  are  assigned  as  many  numbers  (Gaussian  co 
ordinates)  as  the  continuum  has  dimensions.  This  is 
done  in  such  a  way,  that  only  one  meaning  can  be  attached 
to  the  assignment,  and  that  numbers  (Gaussian  co 
ordinates)  which  differ  by  an  indefinitely  small  amount 
are  assigned  to  adjacent  points.  The  Gaussian  co 
ordinate  system  is  a  logical  generalisation  of  the  Cartesian 
co-ordinate  system.  It  is  also  applicable  to  non-Euclidean 
continua,  but  only  when,  with  respect  to  the  defined 
"  size  "  or  "  distance,"  small  parts  of  the  continuum 
under  consideration  behave  more  nearly  like  a  Euclidean 
system,  the  smaller  the  part  of  the  continuum  under 
our  notice.
