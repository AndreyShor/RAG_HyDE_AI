At its left end, it is hinged to the building wall; at its right end, it has
a roller that can roll along the building wall. There is no vertical
force on the roller from the building, only a horizontal force with
magnitude Fh. The horizontal distance between the buildings is
D ! 4.00 m. The rise of the ramp is h ! 0.490 m. A man walks
across the ramp from the left. Figure 12-65b gives Fh as a function
of the horizontal distance x of the man from the building at the
left. The scale of the Fh axis is set by a ! 20 kN and b ! 25 kN.
What are the masses of (a) the ramp and (b) the man?

In Fig. 12-69, a package of mass
m hangs from a short cord that is tied
to the wall via cord 1 and to the ceil-
ing via cord 2. Cord 1 is at angle f !
40° with the horizontal; cord 2 is at an-
gle u. (a) For what value of u is the
tension in cord 2 minimized? (b) In
terms of mg, what is the minimum ten-
sion in cord 2?
61
The force 
in Fig. 12-70
keeps the 6.40 kg block and the pulleys in
equilibrium. The pulleys have negligible
mass and friction. Calculate the tension T in
the upper cable. (Hint: When a cable wraps
halfway around a pulley as here, the magni-
tude of its net force on the pulley is twice
the tension in the cable.)
62
A mine elevator is supported by a sin-
gle steel cable 2.5 cm in diameter. The total
mass of the elevator cage and occupants is
670 kg. By how much does the cable stretch
when the elevator hangs by (a) 12 m of ca-
ble and (b) 362 m of cable? (Neglect the
mass of the cable.)

Four bricks of length L, identi-
cal and uniform, are stacked on top of one
another (Fig. 12-71) in such a way that
part of each extends beyond the
one beneath. Find, in terms of
L, the maximum values of
(a) a1, (b) a2, (c) a3, (d)
a4, and (e) h, such
that the stack is
in 
equilibrium,
on the verge of
falling.

In Fig. 12-66, a 10 kg sphere
is supported on a frictionless plane
inclined at angle u ! 45° from the
horizontal. Angle f is 25°. Cal-
culate the tension in the cable.

In Fig.12-67a,a uniform 40.0 kg
beam is centered over two rollers.
Vertical lines across the beam mark
off equal lengths.Two of the lines are
centered over the rollers; a 10.0 kg
package of tamales is centered over
roller B.What are the magnitudes of
the forces on the beam from (a)
roller A and (b) roller B? The beam
is then rolled to the left until the
right-hand end is centered over
roller B (Fig. 12-67b). What now are
the magnitudes of the forces on the
beam from (c) roller A and (d)
roller B? Next, the beam is rolled to
the right. Assume that it has a
length of 0.800 m. (e) What hori-
zontal distance between the pack-
age and roller B puts the beam on
the verge of losing contact with
roller A?

In Fig. 12-68, an 817 kg
construction bucket is suspended
by a cable A that is attached at O
to two other cables B and C, mak-
ing angles u1 ! 51.0° and u2 ! 66.0°
with the horizontal. Find the ten-
sions in (a) cable A, (b) cable B,
and (c) cable C. (Hint: To avoid
solving two equations in two un-
knowns,
position the axes as
shown in the figure.)

In Fig. 12-72, two identical, uni-
form, and frictionless spheres, each of
mass m, rest in a rigid rectangular con-
tainer.A line connecting their centers is
at 45° to the horizontal. Find the
magnitudes of the forces on the spheres
from (a) the bottom of the container,
(b) the left side of the container,
(c) the right side of the container, and
(d) each other. (Hint: The force of one
sphere on the other is directed along
the center–center line.)

In Fig. 12-73, a uniform beam
with a weight of 60 N and a length of
3.2 m is hinged at its lower end, and
a horizontal force 
of magnitude
50 N acts at its upper end. The beam
is held vertical by a cable that makes
angle u ! 25° with the ground and is
attached to the beam at height h !
2.0 m. What are (a) the tension in
the cable and (b) the force on the
beam from the hinge in unit-vector
notation?
