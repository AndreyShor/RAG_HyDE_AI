Cosmological red shift. The expansion of the universe is
often represented with a drawing like Fig. 44-15a. In that figure, we
are located at the symbol labeled MW (for the Milky Way galaxy),
at the origin of an r axis that extends radially away from us in any
direction. Other, very distant galaxies are also represented.
Superimposed on their symbols are their velocity vectors as in-
ferred from the red shift of the light reaching us from the galaxies.
In accord with Hubble’s law, the speed of each galaxy is propor-
tional to its distance from us. Such drawings can be misleading be-
cause they imply (1) that the red shifts are due to the motions of
galaxies relative to us, as they rush away from us through static (sta-
tionary) space,and (2) that we are at the center of all this motion.
Actually, the expansion of the universe and the increased sep-
aration of the galaxies are due not to an outward rush of the galax-
ies into pre-existing space but to an expansion of space itself
throughout the universe. Space is dynamic, not static.
Figures 44-15b, c, and d show a different way of representing
the universe and its expansion. Each part of the figure gives part of
a one-dimensional section of the universe (along an r axis); the
other two spatial dimensions of the universe are not shown. Each
of the three parts of the figure shows the Milky Way and six other
galaxies (represented by dots); the parts are positioned along a
time axis, with time increasing upward. In part b, at the earliest
time of the three parts, the Milky Way and the six other galaxies
are represented as being relatively close to one another. As time
progresses upward in the figures, space expands, causing the galax-
ies to move apart. Note that the figure parts are drawn relative to
the Milky Way, and from that observation point all the other galax-
ies move away because of the expansion. However, there is nothing
special about the Milky Way—the galaxies also move away from
any other observation point we might have chosen.
Figures 44-16a and b focus on just the Milky Way galaxy and
one of the other galaxies, galaxy A, at two particular times during
the expansion. In part a, galaxy A is a distance r from the Milky
Way and is emitting a light wave of wavelength l. In part b, after a
time interval )t, that light wave is being detected at Earth. Let us
represent the universe’s expansion rate per unit length of space
with 9, which we assume to be constant during time interval )t.
Then during )t, every unit length of space (say, every meter) ex-
SSM
pands by an amount 9 )t; hence, a distance r expands by r9 )t.The
light wave of Figs. 44.16a and b travels at speed c from galaxy A to
Earth. (a) Show that
The detected wavelength 
of the light is greater than the emit-
ted wavelength l because space expanded during time interval )t.
This increase in wavelength is called the cosmological red shift; it is
not a Doppler effect. (b) Show that the change in wavelength
is given by
