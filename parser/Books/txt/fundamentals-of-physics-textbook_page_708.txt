Figure 23-52 gives the magni-
tude of the electric field inside and
outside a sphere with a positive charge
distributed uniformly throughout its
volume.The scale of the vertical axis is
set by Es$5.0(107 N/C. What is the
charge on the sphere?
•45
Two charged concentric spher-
ical shells have radii 10.0 cm and 15.0 cm. The charge on the inner
shell is 4.00 ( 10 '8 C, and that on the outer shell is 2.00 ( 10 '8 C.
Find the electric field (a) at r $ 12.0 cm and (b) at r $ 20.0 cm.
•46
Assume that a ball of charged particles has a uniformly
distributed negative charge density except for a narrow radial
tunnel through its center, from the surface on one side to the
surface on the opposite side. Also assume that we can position a
proton anywhere along the tunnel or outside the ball. Let FR be
the magnitude of the electrostatic force on the proton when it is
located at the ball’s surface, at radius R. As a multiple of R, how
far from the surface is there a point where the force magnitude is
0.50FR if we move the proton (a) away from the ball and (b) into
the tunnel?
•47
An unknown charge sits on a conducting solid sphere of
radius 10 cm. If the electric field 15 cm from the center of the
sphere has the magnitude 3.0 ( 10 3 N/C and is directed radially in-
ward, what is the net charge on the sphere?

A charged particle is held at the center of a spherical
shell. Figure 23-53 gives the magnitude E of the electric field ver-
sus radial distance r. The scale of the vertical axis is set by Es $
10.0 ( 107 N/C. Approximately, what is the net charge on the
shell?

an angle u $ 30° with a vertical, uniformly

and into and out of the page, calculate the surface
charge density s of the sheet.
