36-7 X-RAY DIFFRACTION
Figure 36-27 X rays are generated when
electrons leaving heated filament F are
accelerated through a potential difference
V and strike a metal target T. The “win-
dow” W in the evacuated chamber C is
transparent to x rays.

A standard optical diffraction grating cannot be used to discriminate
between different wavelengths in the x-ray wavelength range. For l ! 1 Å
(! 0.1 nm) and d ! 3000 nm, for example, Eq. 36-25 shows that the first-order
maximum occurs at
This is too close to the central maximum to be practical. A grating with d % l is
desirable, but, because x-ray wavelengths are about equal to atomic diameters,
such gratings cannot be constructed mechanically.
In 1912, it occurred to German physicist Max von Laue that a crystalline
solid, which consists of a regular array of atoms, might form a natural three-
dimensional “diffraction grating” for x rays. The idea is that, in a crystal such as
sodium chloride (NaCl), a basic unit of atoms (called the unit cell) repeats itself
throughout the array. Figure 36-28a represents a section through a crystal of
NaCl and identifies this basic unit. The unit cell is a cube measuring a0 on
each side.
When an x-ray beam enters a crystal such as NaCl, x rays are scattered—that
is, redirected—in all directions by the crystal structure. In some directions the
scattered waves undergo destructive interference, resulting in intensity minima;
in other directions the interference is constructive, resulting in intensity maxima.
This process of scattering and interference is a form of diffraction.

complicated, the maxima turn out to be in directions as if the x rays were
