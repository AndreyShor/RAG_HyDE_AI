To start, consider the statement
,
(3-9)
which says that the vector 
is the same as the vector 
. Thus, each 
component of 
must be the same as the corresponding component of 
:
rx " ax # bx
(3-10)
ry " ay # by
(3-11)
rz " az # bz.
(3-12)
In other words, two vectors must be equal if their corresponding components are
equal. Equations 3-9 to 3-12 tell us that to add vectors 
and , we must (1) re-
solve the vectors into their scalar components; (2) combine these scalar compo-
nents, axis by axis, to get the components of the sum 
; and (3) combine
the components of 
to get 
itself. We have a choice in step 3. We can express 
in unit-vector notation or in magnitude-angle notation.
This procedure for adding vectors by components also applies to vector 
subtractions. Recall that a subtraction such as 
can be rewritten as an
addition 
.To subtract, we add 
and 
by components, to get
dx " ax $ bx,
dy " ay $ by,
and
dz " az $ bz,

3-2 UNIT VECTORS, ADDING VECTORS BY COMPONENTS
Vectors and the Laws of Physics
So far, in every figure that includes a coordinate system, the x and y axes are par-
allel to the edges of the book page. Thus, when a vector 
is included, its compo-
nents ax and ay are also parallel to the edges (as in Fig. 3-15a).The only reason for
that orientation of the axes is that it looks “proper”; there is no deeper reason.
We could, instead, rotate the axes (but not the vector ) through an angle f as in
a

Rotating the axes
changes the components
but not the vector.
Fig. 3-15b, in which case the components would have new values, call them a/x and
a/y. Since there are an infinite number of choices of f, there are an infinite num-
ber of different pairs of components for .
Which then is the “right” pair of components? The answer is that they are all
equally valid because each pair (with its axes) just gives us a different way of de-
scribing the same vector ; all produce the same magnitude and direction for the
vector. In Fig. 3-15 we have
(3-14)
and
u " u/ # f.
(3-15)
The point is that we have great freedom in choosing a coordinate system, be-
cause the relations among vectors do not depend on the location of the origin or
on the orientation of the axes.This is also true of the relations of physics; they are
all independent of the choice of coordinate system.Add to that the simplicity and
richness of the language of vectors and you can see why the laws of physics are 
almost always presented in that language: one equation, like Eq. 3-9, can repre-
sent three (or even more) relations, like Eqs. 3-10, 3-11, and 3-12.
