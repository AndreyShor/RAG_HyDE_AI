principle  of  relativity  and  the  law  of  propagation  of  light, 
and  that  by  systematically  holding  fast  to  both  these 
laws  a  logically  rigid  theory  could  be  arrived  at.  This 
theory  has  been  called  the  special  theory  of  relativity 
to  distinguish  it  from  the  extended  theory,  with  which 
we  shall  deal  later.  In  the  following  pages  we  shall 
present  the  fundamental  ideas  of  the  special  theory  of 
relativity.
