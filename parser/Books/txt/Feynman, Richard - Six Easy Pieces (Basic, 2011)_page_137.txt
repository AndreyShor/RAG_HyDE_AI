All the masses and distances are known. You say, “We knew it al-
ready for the earth.” Yes, but we did not know the mass of the earth.
By knowing G from this experiment and by knowing how strongly
the earth attracts, we can indirectly learn how great is the mass of
the earth! This experiment has been called “weighing the earth” by
some people, and it can be used to determine the coefficient G of
the gravity law. This is the only way in which the mass of the earth
can be determined. G turns out to be
6.670 ¥ 10–11 newton ∙ m2/kg2.
It is hard to exaggerate the importance of the effect on the history
of science produced by this great success of the theory of gravitation.
Compare the confusion, the lack of conﬁdence, the incomplete
knowledge that prevailed in the earlier ages, when there were endless
debates and paradoxes, with the clarity and simplicity of this law—
this fact that all the moons and planets and stars have such a simple
