There then appear to be some new deviations, but careful study
indicates that the dirty water in the bathtub is changing its level.
The child is throwing blocks into the water, and she cannot see
them because it is so dirty, but she can ﬁnd out how many blocks
are in the water by adding another term to her formula. Since the
original height of the water was 6 inches and each block raises the
water a quarter of an inch, this new formula would be:

Conservation of Energy
In the gradual increase in the complexity of her world, she ﬁnds
a whole series of terms representing ways of calculating how many
blocks are in places where she is not allowed to look. As a result,
she ﬁnds a complex formula, a quantity which has to be computed,
which always stays the same in her situation.
What is the analogy of this to the conservation of energy? The
most remarkable aspect that must be abstracted from this picture
is that there are no blocks. Take away the ﬁrst terms in (4.1) and
(4.2) and we ﬁnd ourselves calculating more or less abstract things.
The analogy has the following points: First, when we are calculating
the energy, sometimes some of it leaves the system and goes away,
or sometimes some comes in. In order to verify the conservation
of energy, we must be careful that we have not put any in or taken
any out. Second, the energy has a large number of different forms,
and there is a formula for each one. These are gravitational energy,
kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, chemical
energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy. If we total up
the formulas for each of these contributions, it will not change ex-
cept for energy going in and out.
It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowl-
edge of what energy is. We do not have a picture that energy comes
