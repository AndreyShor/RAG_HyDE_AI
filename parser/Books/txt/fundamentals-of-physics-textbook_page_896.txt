CHAPTER 30
INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE
At t ! 10 s, then,
(Answer)
Direction: To find the direction of #ind, we first note that in
Fig. 30-6 the flux through the loop is out of the page and in-
creasing. Because the induced field Bind (due to the induced
current) must oppose that increase, it must be into the page.
Using the curled–straight right-hand rule (Fig.30-5c),we find
that the induced current is clockwise around the loop, and
thus so is the induced emf #ind.
(b) What is the current in the loop at t ! 10 s?
KEY IDEA
The point here is that two emfs tend to move charges
around the loop.
Calculation: The induced emf #ind tends to drive a current
clockwise around the loop; the battery’s emf #bat tends to
drive a current counterclockwise. Because #ind is greater
than #bat, the net emf #net is clockwise, and thus so is the
current. To find the current at t ! 10 s, we use Eq. 27-2 
(i ! #/R):

Figure 30-6 shows a conducting loop consisting of a half-circle
of radius r ! 0.20 m and three straight sections. The half-
circle lies in a uniform magnetic field 
that is directed out
of the page; the field magnitude is given by B ! 4.0t2 &
2.0t & 3.0, with B in teslas and t in seconds. An ideal battery
with emf #bat ! 2.0 V is connected to the loop.The resistance
of the loop is 2.0 1.
(a) What are the magnitude and direction of the emf #ind
induced around the loop by field 
at t ! 10 s?
KEY IDEAS
1. According to Faraday’s law, the magnitude of #ind is
equal to the rate d0B/dt at which the magnetic flux
through the loop changes.
2. The flux through the loop depends on how much of the
loop’s area lies within the flux and how the area is ori-
ented in the magnetic field .
3. Because 
is uniform and is perpendicular to the plane
of the loop, the flux is given by Eq. 30-2 (0B ! BA).
(We don’t need to integrate B over the area to get
the flux.)
4. The induced field Bind (due to the induced current) must
always oppose the change in the magnetic flux.
Magnitude: Using Eq. 30-2 and realizing that only the field
magnitude B changes in time (not the area A), we rewrite
Faraday’s law, Eq. 30-4, as
Because the flux penetrates the loop only within the half-
circle, the area A in this equation is 
. Substituting this
and the given expression for B yields

Sample Problem 30.02
Induced emf and current due to a changing uniform B field
KEY IDEAS
1. Because the magnitude of the magnetic field 
is chang-
ing with time, the magnetic flux 0B through the loop is
also changing.
2. The changing flux induces an emf # in the loop according
to Faraday’s law, which we can write as # ! d0B/dt.
3. To use that law, we need an expression for the flux 0B at

Sample Problem 30.03
Induced emf due to a changing nonuniform B field
Figure 30-7 shows a rectangular loop of wire immersed in a
nonuniform and varying magnetic field 
that is perpendi-
cular to and directed into the page. The field’s magnitude is
given by B ! 4t2x2, with B in teslas, t in seconds, and x in
meters. (Note that the function depends on both time and
position.) The loop has width W ! 3.0 m and height H !
2.0 m.What are the magnitude and direction of the induced
emf # around the loop at t ! 0.10 s?
