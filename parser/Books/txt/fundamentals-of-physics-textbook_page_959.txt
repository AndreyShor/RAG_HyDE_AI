Checkpoint 8
An alternating-current emf device in a certain circuit has a smaller resistance than that
of the resistive load in the circuit;to increase the transfer of energy from the device to
the load,a transformer will be connected between the two.(a) Should Ns be greater
than or less than Np? (b) Will that make it a step-up or step-down transformer?
Eq. 31-77 yields
(Answer)
Similarly, in the secondary circuit,
(Answer)
You can check that Is ! Ip(Np/Ns) as required by Eq.31-80.
(c) What is the resistive load Rs in the secondary circuit? What
is the corresponding resistive load Rp in the primary circuit?
One way: We can use V ! IR to relate the resistive load to the
rms voltage and current.For the secondary circuit,we find
(Answer)
Similarly, for the primary circuit we find
(Answer)
Second way: We use the fact that Rp equals the equivalent re-
sistive load “seen” from the primary side of the transformer,
which is a resistance modified by the turns ratio and given by
Eq. 31-82 (Req ! (Np/Ns)2R). If we substitute Rp for Req and Rs
for R,that equation yields

Sample Problem 31.08
Transformer: turns ratio, average power, rms currents
A transformer on a utility pole operates at Vp
8.5 kV on
the primary side and supplies electrical energy to a number
of nearby houses at Vs ! 120 V, both quantities being rms
values.Assume an ideal step-down transformer,a purely resis-
tive load,and a power factor of unity.
(a) What is the turns ratio Np/Ns of the transformer?
KEY IDEA
The turns ratio Np/Ns is related to the (given) rms primary
and secondary voltages via Eq. 31-79 (Vs ! VpNs/Np).
Calculation: We can write Eq. 31-79 as
(31-83)
(Note that the right side of this equation is the inverse of the
turns ratio.) Inverting both sides of Eq. 31-83 gives us
(Answer)
(b) The average rate of energy consumption (or dissipation) in
the houses served by the transformer is 78 kW.What are the rms
currents in the primary and secondary of the transformer?
KEY IDEA
For a purely resistive load, the power factor cos f is unity; thus,
the average rate at which energy is supplied and dissipated is
given by Eq.31-77 (Pavg ! #I ! IV).
Calculations: In the primary circuit, with Vp

LC Energy Transfers
In an oscillating LC circuit, energy is
shuttled periodically between the electric field of the capacitor and
the magnetic field of the inductor; instantaneous values of the two
forms of energy are
