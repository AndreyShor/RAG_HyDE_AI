is along a particular axis through the point, force 
is zero. For all other direc-
tions of 
, the magnitude of 
is always proportional to v sin f, where f is the
angle between the zero-force axis and the direction of . Furthermore, the direc-
tion of 
is always perpendicular to the direction of 
. (These results suggest
that a cross product is involved.)
The Field. We can then define a magnetic field
to be a vector quantity that
is directed along the zero-force axis. We can next measure the magnitude of 
when 
is directed perpendicular to that axis and then define the magnitude
of 
in terms of that force magnitude:
where q is the charge of the particle.
We can summarize all these results with the following vector equation:
(28-2)
that is, the force 
on the particle is equal to the charge q times the cross product
of its velocity 
and the field 
(all measured in the same reference frame).
Using Eq. 3-24 for the cross product, we can write the magnitude of 
as
FB !
vB sin f,
(28-3)
where f is the angle between the directions of velocity 
and magnetic field .
Finding the Magnetic Force on a Particle
Equation 28-3 tells us that the magnitude of the force 
acting on a particle in
a magnetic field is proportional to the charge q and speed v of the particle. Thus,
the force is equal to zero if the charge is zero or if the particle is stationary.
Equation 28-3 also tells us that the magnitude of the force is zero if

Directions. Equation 28-2 tells us all this plus the direction of 
. From
Module 3-3, we know that the cross product 
in Eq. 28-2 is a vector that is
perpendicular to the two vectors 
and 
. The right-hand rule (Figs. 28-2a
through c) tells us that  the thumb of the right hand points in the direction
of

into

force 
has the same sign as 
and thus must be in the same direction; that
is, for positive q,
is directed along the thumb (Fig. 28-2d). If q is negative, then
