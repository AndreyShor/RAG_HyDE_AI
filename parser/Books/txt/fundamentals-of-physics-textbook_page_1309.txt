Scientists and engineers working with atomic masses often prefer to report
the mass of an atom by means of the atom’s mass excess ), defined as
) ! M # A
(mass excess),
(42-6)
where M is the actual mass of the atom in atomic mass units and A is the mass
number for that atom’s nucleus.
Nuclear Binding Energies
The mass M of a nucleus is less than the total mass 'm of its individual protons
and neutrons. That means that the mass energy Mc 2 of a nucleus is less than the
total mass energy '(mc 2) of its individual protons and neutrons. The difference
between these two energies is called the binding energy of the nucleus:
)Ebe ! '(mc 2) # Mc 2
(binding energy).
(42-7)
Caution: Binding energy is not an energy that resides in the nucleus. Rather,
it is a difference in mass energy between a nucleus and its individual nucleons: If
we were able to separate a nucleus into its nucleons, we would have to transfer a
total energy equal to )Ebe to those particles during the separating process.
Although we cannot actually tear apart a nucleus in this way, the nuclear binding
energy is still a convenient measure of how well a nucleus is held together, in the
sense that it measures how difficult the nucleus would be to take apart.
A better measure is the binding energy per nucleon )Eben, which is the ratio of
the binding energy )Ebe of a nucleus to the number A of nucleons in that nucleus:
(binding energy per nucleon).
(42-8)
We can think of the binding energy per nucleon as the average energy needed to
separate a nucleus into its individual nucleons. A greater binding energy per nu-
cleon means a more tightly bound nucleus.
Figure 42-7 is a plot of the binding energy per nucleon )Eben versus mass
number A for a large number of nuclei. Those high on the plot are very tightly

42-2 SOME NUCLEAR PROPERTIES
Figure 42-7 The binding energy per nucleon for some representative nuclides.The nickel nu-
clide 62Ni has the highest binding energy per nucleon (about 8.794 60 MeV/nucleon) of any
known stable nuclide.Note that the alpha particle (4He) has a higher binding energy per nu-
cleon than its neighbors in the periodic table and thus is also particularly stable.
