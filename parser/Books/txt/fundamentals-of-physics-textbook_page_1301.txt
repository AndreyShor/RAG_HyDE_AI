PROBLEMS
•41
In a particular crystal, the highest occupied band is full. The
crystal is transparent to light of wavelengths longer than 295 nm
but opaque at shorter wavelengths. Calculate, in electron-volts, the
gap between the highest occupied band and the next higher
(empty) band for this material.
•42
A potassium chloride crystal has an energy band gap of 7.6
eV above the topmost occupied band, which is full. Is this crystal
opaque or transparent to light of wavelength 140 nm?
•43
A certain computer chip that is about the size of a postage
stamp (2.54 cm " 2.22 cm) contains about 3.5 million transistors. If
the transistors are square, what must be their maximum dimen-
sion? (Note: Devices other than transistors are also on the chip,
and there must be room for the interconnections among the circuit
elements. Transistors smaller than 0.7 mm are now commonly and
inexpensively fabricated.)
•44
A silicon-based MOSFET has a square gate 0.50 mm on
edge. The insulating silicon oxide layer that separates the gate
from the p-type substrate is 0.20 mm thick and has a dielectric
constant of 4.5. (a) What is the equivalent gate–substrate
capacitance (treating the gate as one plate and the substrate as
the other plate)? (b) Approximately how many elementary
charges e appear in the gate when there is a gate–source
potential difference of 1.0 V?

(a) Find the angle u between adjacent nearest-neighbor bonds
in the silicon lattice. Recall that each silicon atom is bonded to four
of its nearest neighbors.The four neighbors form a regular tetrahe-

tetrahedron are 388 pm apart.
