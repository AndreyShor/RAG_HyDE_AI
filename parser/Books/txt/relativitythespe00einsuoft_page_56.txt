THEOREM  OF  THE  ADDITION  OF  VELOCITIES. 
THE  EXPERIMENT  OF  FIZEAU 
NOW   in    practice    we    can    move    clocks    and 
measuring-rods  only   with    velocities  that   are 
small  compared  with  the  velocity  of  light ;  hence 
we  shall  hardly  be  able  to  compare  the  results  of  the 
previous  section  directly  with  the  reality.     But,  on  the 
other  hand,  these  results  must  strike  you  as  being  very 
singular,  and  for  that  reason  I  shall  now  draw  another 
conclusion  from  the  theory,  one  which  can  easily  be 
derived  from  the  foregoing  considerations,  and  which 
has  been  most  elegantly  confirmed  by  experiment. 
In  Section  VI  we  derived  the  theorem  of  the  addition 
of  velocities  in  one  direction  in  the  form  which  also 
results  from  the  hypotheses  of  classical  mechanics.  This 
theorem  can  also  be  deduced  readily  from  the  Galilei 
transformation  (Section  XI).  In  place  of  the  man 
walking  inside  the  carriage,  we  introduce  a  point  moving 
relatively  to  the  co-ordinate  system  K'  in  accordance 
with  the  equation 
x'=wt'. 
By  means  of  the  first  and  fourth  equations  of  the  Galilei 
transformation  we  can  express  x'  and  t'  in  terms  of  x 
and  t,  and  we  then  obtain 
x=(v-{-w)t.
