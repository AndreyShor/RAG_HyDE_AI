30-1 FARADAY’S LAW AND LENZ’S LAW
Heads Up. The flux of 
always opposes the change in the flux of 
, but 
is not always opposite 
. For example, if we next pull the magnet away
from the loop in Fig. 30-4, the magnet’s flux 
B is still downward through the
loop, but it is now decreasing. The flux of 
must now be downward inside
the loop, to oppose that decrease (Fig. 30-5b). Thus,
and 
are now in the
same direction. In Figs. 30-5c and d, the south pole of the magnet approaches
and retreats from the loop, again with opposition to change.

Figure 30-5 The direction of the current i induced in a loop is such that the current’s magnetic field 
opposes the change in the magnetic
field 
inducing i.The field 
is always directed opposite an increasing field 
and in the same direction as a decreasing field
.The curled–straight right-hand rule gives the direction of the induced current based on the direction of the induced field.

Increasing the external
field B induces a current
with a field Bind that
opposes the change.
The induced 
current creates 
this field, trying
to offset the 
change.
The fingers are 
in the current's 
direction; the
thumb is in the 
induced field's 
direction.
Decreasing the external
field B induces a current
with a field Bind that
opposes the change.
Increasing the external
field B induces a current
with a field Bind that
opposes the change.
Decreasing the external
field B induces a current
with a field Bind that
opposes the change.

Checkpoint 2
The figure shows three situations in which identical circular
conducting loops are in uniform magnetic fields that are either
increasing (Inc) or decreasing (Dec) in magnitude at identical rates.
In each, the dashed line coincides with a diameter. Rank the situa-
tions according to the magnitude of the current induced in the loops,
greatest first.
