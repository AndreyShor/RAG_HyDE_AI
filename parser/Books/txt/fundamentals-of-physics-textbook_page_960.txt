ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS AND ALTERNATING CURRENT
as the differential equation of LC oscillations (with no resistance).
The solution of Eq. 31-11 is
q ! Q cos(vt $ f)
(charge),
(31-12)
in which Q is the charge amplitude (maximum charge on the capac-
itor) and the angular frequency v of the oscillations is
(31-4)
The phase constant f in Eq. 31-12 is determined by the initial con-
ditions (at t ! 0) of the system.
The current i in the system at any time t is
i ! 'vQ sin(vt $ f)
(current),
(31-13)
in which vQ is the current amplitude I.
Damped Oscillations
Oscillations in an LC circuit are damped
when a dissipative element R is also present in the circuit.Then
(RLC circuit).
(31-24)
The solution of this differential equation is
q ! Qe'Rt/2L cos(v*t $ f),
(31-25)
where
(31-26)
We consider only situations with small R and thus small damping;
then v* % v.
Alternating Currents; Forced Oscillations
A series RLC
circuit may be set into forced oscillation at a driving angular fre-
quency vd by an external alternating emf
# ! #m sin vdt.
(31-28)
The current driven in the circuit is   
i ! I sin(vdt ' f),
(31-29)
where f is the phase constant of the current.
Resonance
The current amplitude I in a series RLC circuit
driven by a sinusoidal external emf is a maximum (I ! #m/R) when
the driving angular frequency vd equals the natural angular 
frequency v of the circuit (that is, at resonance). Then XC ! XL,
f ! 0, and the current is in phase with the emf.
Single Circuit Elements
The alternating potential difference
across a resistor has amplitude VR ! IR; the current is in phase
with the potential difference.
For a capacitor,VC ! IXC, in which XC ! 1/vdC is the capacitive
reactance; the current here leads the potential difference by 90°
(f ! '90° ! 'p/2 rad).

For an inductor,VL ! IXL, in which XL ! vdL is the inductive
reactance; the current here lags the potential difference by 90°
(f ! $90° ! $p/2 rad).
Series RLC Circuits
For a series RLC circuit with an alternat-
ing external emf given by Eq. 31-28 and a resulting alternating
current given by Eq. 31-29,
(current amplitude) (31-60, 31-63)
and
(phase constant).
(31-65)
Defining the impedance Z of the circuit as
(impedance)
(31-61)
allows us to write Eq. 31-60 as I ! #m/Z.
Power
In a series RLC circuit, the average power Pavg of the
generator is equal to the production rate of thermal energy in the
resistor:
(31-71, 31-76)
Here rms stands for root-mean-square; the rms quantities are
related to the maximum quantities by 
and 
The term cos f is called the power factor of the
circuit.
Transformers
A transformer (assumed to be ideal) is an iron core
on which are wound a primary coil of Np turns and a secondary coil of
Ns turns. If the primary coil is connected across an alternating-current
generator,the primary and secondary voltages are related by
(transformation of voltage).
(31-79)
The currents through the coils are related by
(transformation of currents),
(31-80)
and the equivalent resistance of the secondary circuit, as seen by
the generator, is
(31-82)
where R is the resistive load in the secondary circuit. The ratio
Np/Ns is called the transformer’s turns ratio.

Figure 31-19 shows three oscillating LC circuits with identical
inductors and capacitors. At a particular time, the charges on the
capacitor plates (and thus the electric fields between the plates)
are all at their maximum values. Rank the circuits according to the
time taken to fully discharge the capacitors during the oscillations,
greatest first.
