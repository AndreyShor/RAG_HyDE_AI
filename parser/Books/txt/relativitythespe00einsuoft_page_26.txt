8    SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
ing  of  specifications  of  position  must  always  be  sought 
in  accordance  with  the  above  considerations.1 
We  thus  obtain  the  following  result  :  Every  descrip 
tion  of  events  in  space  involves  the  use  of  a  rigid  body 
to  which  such  events  have  to  be  referred.  The  resulting 
relationship  takes  for  granted  that  the  laws  of  Euclidean 
geometry  hold  for  "  distances,"  the  "  distance  "  being 
represented  physically  by  means  of  the  convention  of 
two  marks  on  a  rigid  body. 
1  A  refinement  and  modification  of  these  views  does  not  become 
necessary  until  we  come  to  deal  with  the  general  theory  of 
relativity,  treated  in  the  second  part  of  this  book.
