Proof
First, we consider the individual elements of the body. Figure 12-4a shows an
extended body, of mass M, and one of its elements, of mass mi. A gravitational
force 
acts on each such element and is equal to 
The subscript on 
means 
is the gravitational acceleration at the location of the element i (it can be
different for other elements).
For the body in Fig. 12-4a, each force F
:
gi acting on an element produces a
torque ti on the element about the origin O, with a moment arm xi. Using Eq. 10-
41 (t ! r"F) as a guide, we can write each torque ti as
ti ! xiFgi.
(12-10)
The net torque on all the elements of the body is then
tnet !
ti !
xiFgi.
(12-11)
Next, we consider the body as a whole. Figure 12-4b shows the gravitational
force 
acting at the body’s center of gravity. This force produces a torque t on
the body about O, with moment arm xcog.Again using Eq. 10-41, we can write this
torque as
t ! xcogFg.
(12-12)
The gravitational force F
:
g on the body is equal to the sum of the gravitational
forces F
:
gi on all its elements, so we can substitute 'Fgi for Fg in Eq. 12-12 to write
t ! xcog
Fgi.
(12-13)
Now recall that the torque due to force F
:
g acting at the center of gravity
is equal to the net torque due to all the forces F
:
gi acting on all the elements of
the body. (That is how we defined the center of gravity.) Thus, t in Eq. 12-13 is
equal to tnet in Eq. 12-11. Putting those two equations together, we can write
xcog
Fgi !
xiFgi.
Substituting migi for Fgi gives us
xcog
migi !
ximigi.
(12-14)
Now here is a key idea: If the accelerations gi at all the locations of the elements
are the same, we can cancel gi from this equation to write
xcog
mi !
ximi.
(12-15)
The sum 'mi of the masses of all the elements is the mass M of the body.
Therefore, we can rewrite Eq. 12-15 as
(12-16)
xcog ! 1
M 'ximi.

12-1 EQUILIBRIUM
If 
is the same for all elements of a body, then the body’s center of gravity (cog)
is coincident with the body’s center of mass (com).
g
:
This is approximately true for everyday objects because 
varies only a little
along Earth’s surface and decreases in magnitude only slightly with altitude.
Thus, for objects like a mouse or a moose, we have been justified in assuming that
the gravitational force acts at the center of mass. After the following proof, we
shall resume that assumption.
