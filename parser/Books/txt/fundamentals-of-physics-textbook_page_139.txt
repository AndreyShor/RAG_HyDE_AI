5-3 APPLYING NEWTON’S LAWS
Dead-End Solution: Let us now include force 
by writ-
ing, again for the x axis,
Fapp $ FAB " mAa.
(We use the minus sign to include the direction of 
.)
Because FAB is a second unknown, we cannot solve this
equation for a.
Successful Solution: Because of the direction in which force
is applied,the two blocks form a rigidly connected system.
We can relate the net force on the system to the acceleration of
the system with Newton’s second law. Here, once again for the
x axis,we can write that law as
Fapp " (mA # mB)a,
where now we properly apply 
to the system with
total mass mA
mB. Solving for a and substituting known
values, we find
(Answer)
Thus, the acceleration of the system and of each block is in the
positive direction of the x axis and has the magnitude 2.0 m/s2.
(b) What is the (horizontal) force 
on block B from
block A (Fig. 5-18c)?
KEY IDEA 
We can relate the net force on block B to the block’s accel-
eration with Newton’s second law.
Calculation: Here we can write that law, still for compo-
nents along the x axis, as
FBA " mBa,
which, with known values, gives
FBA " (6.0 kg)(2.0 m/s2) " 12 N.
(Answer)
Thus, force 
is in the positive direction of the x axis and
has a magnitude of 12 N.

Sample Problem 5.07
Acceleration of block pushing on block
Some homework problems involve objects that move to-
gether, because they are either shoved together or tied to-
gether. Here is an example in which you apply Newton’s
second law to the composite of two blocks and then to the
individual blocks.
In Fig. 5-18a, a constant horizontal force 
of magni-

tude 20 N is applied to block A of mass mA
4.0 kg, which
pushes against block B of mass mB " 6.0 kg.The blocks slide
over a frictionless surface, along an x axis.
(a) What is the acceleration of the blocks?
Serious Error: Because force 
is applied directly
to block A, we use Newton’s second law to relate that
force to the acceleration 
of block A. Because the motion
is along the x axis, we use that law for x components
(Fnet, x " max), writing it as
Fapp " mAa.
However, this is seriously wrong because 
is not the
only horizontal force acting on block A. There is also the
force 
from block B (Fig. 5-18b).

This force causes the
acceleration of the full
two-block system.
This is the only force
causing the acceleration
of block B.
These are the two forces
acting on just block A.
Their net force causes
its acceleration.

the upward acceleration is the 939 N reading on the scale.Thus,
the net force on the passenger is
Fnet " FN $ Fg " 939 N $ 708 N " 231 N,
(Answer)
during the upward acceleration. However, his acceleration
ap,cab relative to the frame of the cab is zero.Thus, in the non-
inertial frame of the accelerating cab, Fnet is not equal to
map,cab,and Newton’s second law does not hold.
