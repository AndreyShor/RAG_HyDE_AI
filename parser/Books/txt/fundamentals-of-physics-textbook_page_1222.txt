called the well depth. The analogy between waves on a stretched string and mat-
ter waves fails us for wells of finite depth because we can no longer be sure that
matter wave nodes exist at x ! 0 and at x ! L. (As we shall see, they don’t.)
To find the wave functions describing the quantum states of an electron in
the finite well of Fig. 39-7, we must resort to Schrödinger’s equation, the basic
equation of quantum physics. From Module 38-6 recall that, for motion in one
dimension, we use Schrödinger’s equation in the form of Eq. 38-19:
(39-18)
Rather than attempting to solve this equation for the finite well, we simply state the
results for particular numerical values of U0 and L.Figure 39-8 shows three results as
graphs of 
,the probability density,for a well with U0 ! 450 eV and L
100 pm.
The probability density 
for each graph in Fig. 39-8 satisfies Eq. 39-14,
the normalization equation; so we know that the areas under all three probability
density plots are numerically equal to 1.
If you compare Fig. 39-8 for a finite well with Fig. 39-6 for an infinite well, you
will see one striking difference: For a finite well, the electron matter wave
penetrates the walls of the well—into a region in which Newtonian mechanics
says the electron cannot exist. This penetration should not be surprising because
we saw in Module 38-9 that an electron can tunnel through a potential energy
barrier. “Leaking” into the walls of a finite potential energy well is a similar
phenomenon. From the plots of c2 in Fig. 39-8, we see that the leakage is greater
for greater values of quantum number n.
Because a matter wave does leak into the walls of a finite well,the wavelength l
for any given quantum state is greater when the electron is trapped in a finite well
than when it is trapped in an infinite well of the same length L. Equation 39-3 
then tells us that the energy E for an electron in any given state is less
in the finite well than in the infinite well.
That fact allows us to approximate the energy-level diagram for an elec-
tron trapped in a finite well. As an example, we can approximate the diagram
for the finite well of Fig. 39-8, which has width L ! 100 pm and depth U0 ! 450
eV.The energy-level diagram for an infinite well of that width is shown in Fig. 39-
3. First we remove the portion of Fig. 39-3 above 450 eV. Then we shift the re-
maining four energy levels down, shifting the level for n ! 4 the most because the
wave leakage into the walls is greatest for n ! 4. The result is approximately the
energy-level diagram for the finite well.The actual diagram is Fig. 39-9.
In that figure, an electron with an energy greater than U0 (! 450 eV) has
too much energy to be trapped in the finite well. Thus, it is not confined, and its
energy is not quantized; that is, its energy is not restricted to certain values. To
reach this nonquantized portion of the energy-level diagram and thus to be free,
a trapped electron must somehow obtain enough energy to have a mechanical
energy of 450 eV or greater.

Barely escaping: The electron is initially in its ground
state, with an energy of E1 ! 27 eV. So, to barely become
free, it must receive an energy of
U0 # E1 ! 450 eV # 27 eV ! 423 eV.
Thus the photon must have this much energy. From Eq.

Electron escaping from a finite potential well
Suppose a finite well with U0
450 eV and L
100 pm
confines a single electron in its ground state.
(a) What wavelength of light is needed to barely free it with
a single photon absorption?
KEY IDEA
For the electron to escape, it must receive enough energy to
jump to the nonquantized energy region of Fig. 39-9 and
end up with an energy of at least U0 (! 450 eV).
