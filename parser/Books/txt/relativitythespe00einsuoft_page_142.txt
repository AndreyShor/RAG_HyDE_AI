justification  for  its  existence  in  the  fact  that  it  correlates 
a  large  number  of  single  observations,  and  it  is  just  here 
that  the  "  truth  "  of  the  theory  lies. 
Corresponding  to  the  same  complex  of  empirical  data, 
there  may  be  severa]  theories,  which  differ  from  one 
another  to  a  considerable  extent.  But  as  regards  the 
deductions  from  the  theories  which  are  capable  of 
being  tested,  the  agreement  between  the  theories  may 
be  so  complete,  that  it  becomes  difficult  to  find  such 
deductions  in  which  the  two  theories  differ  from  each 
other.  As  an  example,  a  case  of  general  interest  is 
available  in  the  province  of  biology,  in  the  Darwinian 
theory  of  the  development  of  species  by  selection  in 
the  struggle  for  existence,  and  in  the  theory  of  develop 
ment  which  is  based  on  the  hypothesis  of  the  hereditary 
transmission  of  acquired  characters. 
We  have  another  instance  of  far-reaching  agreement 
between  the  deductions  from  two  theories  in  Newtonian 
mechanics  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  general  theory  of 
relativity  on  the  other.  This  agreement  goes  so  far, 
that  up  to  the  present  we  have  been  able  to  find  only 
a  few  deductions  from  the  general  theory  of  relativity 
which  are  capable  of  investigation,  and  to  which  the 
physics  of  pre-relativity  days  does  not  also  lead,  and 
this  despite  the  profound  difference  in  the  fundamental 
assumptions  of  the  two  theories.  In  what  follows,  we 
shall  again  consider  these  important  deductions,  and  we 
shall  also  discuss  the  empirical  evidence  appertaining  to 
them  which  has  hitherto  been  obtained.

According  to  Newtonian  mechanics  and  Newton's 
law  of  gravitation,  a  planet  which  is  revolving  round  the
