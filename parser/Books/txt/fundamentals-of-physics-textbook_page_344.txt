CHAPTER 11
ROLLING, TORQUE, AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM
M, mass cancels from Eq. 11-46; thus * is independent of the mass.
Equation 11-46 also applies if the shaft of a spinning gyroscope is at an angle
to the horizontal. It holds as well for a spinning top, which is essentially a spinning
gyroscope at an angle to the horizontal.
According to Eq. 11-41, torque 
causes an incremental change 
in the 
angular momentum of the gyroscope in an incremental time interval dt; that is,
(11-44)
However, for a rapidly spinning gyroscope, the magnitude of 
is fixed by
Eq. 11-43.Thus the torque can change only the direction of 
not its magnitude.
From Eq. 11-44 we see that the direction of 
is in the direction of 
per-
pendicular to 
. The only way that 
can be changed in the direction of 
without the magnitude L being changed is for 
to rotate around the z axis as
shown in Fig. 11-22c.
maintains its magnitude, the head of the 
vector follows
a circular path, and 
is always tangent to that path. Since 
must always 
point along the shaft, the shaft must rotate about the z axis in the direction of .
Thus we have precession. Because the spinning gyroscope must obey Newton’s
law in angular form in response to any change in its initial angular momentum, it
must precess instead of merely toppling over.
Precession. We can find the precession rate * by first using Eqs. 11-44 and
11-42 to get the magnitude of 
:
dL ! t dt ! Mgr dt.
(11-45)
As 
changes by an incremental amount in an incremental time interval dt,the shaft
and 
precess around the z axis through incremental angle df.(In Fig.11-22c,angle
df is exaggerated for clarity.) With the aid of Eqs.11-43 and 11-45,we find that df is
given by
Dividing this expression by dt and setting the rate * ! df/dt, we obtain
(precession rate).
(11-46)
This result is valid under the assumption that the spin rate v is rapid. Note that *
decreases as v is increased. Note also that there would be no precession if the
gravitational force 
did not act on the gyroscope, but because I is a function of

Rolling Bodies
For a wheel of radius R rolling smoothly,
vcom ! vR,
(11-2)
where vcom is the linear speed of the wheel’s center of mass and v is
the angular speed of the wheel about its center. The wheel may
also be viewed as rotating instantaneously about the point P of the
“road” that is in contact with the wheel. The angular speed of the
wheel about this point is the same as the angular speed of
the wheel about its center.The rolling wheel has kinetic energy
(11-5)
where Icom is the rotational inertia of the wheel about its center of
mass and M is the mass of the wheel.If the wheel is being accelerated
but is still rolling smoothly,the acceleration of the center of mass 
is related to the angular acceleration a about the center with

Review & Summary
If the wheel rolls smoothly down a ramp of angle u, its acceleration
along an x axis extending up the ramp is

Torque as a Vector
In three dimensions, torque
is a vector
quantity defined relative to a fixed point (usually an origin); it is
(11-14)
where 
is a force applied to a particle and 
is a position vector lo-
cating the particle relative to the fixed point.The magnitude of is

where f is the angle between 
and 
is the component of 
perpendicular to

is the moment arm of

of
