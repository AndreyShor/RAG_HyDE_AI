two-body system and one-dimensional collision of Fig. 9-14. From Eq. 9-25
, we can relate 
to the total linear momentum 
of that two-body
system by writing
.
(9-54)
The total linear momentum 
is conserved during the collision; so it is given by
either side of Eq. 9-50. Let us use the left side to write
.
(9-55)
Substituting this expression for 
in Eq. 9-54 and solving for 
give us
.
(9-56)
The right side of this equation is a constant, and 
has that same constant value
before and after the collision.
For example, Fig. 9-16 shows, in a series of freeze-frames, the motion of the
center of mass for the completely inelastic collision of Fig. 9-15. Body 2 is the tar-
get, and its initial linear momentum in Eq. 9-56 is 
Body 1 is
the projectile, and its initial linear momentum in Eq. 9-56 is 
Note
that as the series of freeze-frames progresses to and then beyond the collision,
the center of mass moves at a constant velocity to the right. After the
collision, the common final speed V of the bodies is equal to 
because then
the center of mass travels with the stuck-together bodies.

The com of the two
bodies is between
them and moves at a

The com moves at the

lision. The systemâ€™s center of mass is shown in each
freeze-frame. The velocity 
of the center of mass is
unaffected by the collision. Because the bodies stick
