REVIEW & SUMMARY
Scalars and Vectors
Scalars, such as temperature, have magni-
tude only. They are specified by a number with a unit (10°C) and
obey the rules of arithmetic and ordinary algebra. Vectors, such as
displacement, have both magnitude and direction (5 m, north) and
obey the rules of vector algebra.
Adding Vectors Geometrically
Two vectors 
and 
may 
be added geometrically by drawing them to a common scale 
and placing them head to tail. The vector connecting the tail of
the first to the head of the second is the vector sum 
. To
subtract 
from 
, reverse the direction of 
to get $ ; then 
add $
to  .Vector addition is commutative
and obeys the associative law
.
Components of a Vector
The (scalar) components ax and ay of
any two-dimensional vector 
along the coordinate axes are found
by dropping perpendicular lines from the ends of 
onto the coor-
dinate axes.The components are given by
ax " a cos u
and
ay " a sin u,
(3-5)
where u is the angle between the positive direction of the x axis
and the direction of . The algebraic sign of a component indi-
cates its direction along the associated axis. Given its compo-
nents, we can find the magnitude and orientation (direction) of
the vector 
by using
and      
Unit-Vector Notation
Unit vectors , , and have magnitudes of
unity and are directed in the positive directions of the x, y, and z
axes, respectively, in a right-handed coordinate system (as defined
by the vector products of the unit vectors).We can write a vector 
in terms of unit vectors as
" ax # ay # az ,
(3-7)
in which ax , ay , and az
are the vector components of 
and ax, ay,
and az are its scalar components.

Review & Summary
Adding Vectors in Component Form
To add vectors in com-
ponent form, we use the rules
rx " ax # bx
ry " ay # by
rz " az # bz.
(3-10 to 3-12)
Here 
and 
are the vectors to be added, and 
is the vector sum.
Note that we add components axis by axis.We can then express the
sum in unit-vector notation or magnitude-angle notation.
Product of a Scalar and a Vector
The product of a scalar s and
a vector 
is a new vector whose magnitude is sv and whose direc-
tion is the same as that of 
if s is positive, and opposite that of 
if
s is negative. (The negative sign reverses the vector.) To divide 
by
s, multiply 
by 1/s.
The Scalar Product
The scalar (or dot) product of two vectors 
and 
is written "
and is the scalar quantity given by
"
" ab cos f,
(3-20)
in which f is the angle between the directions of 
and .A scalar
product is the product of the magnitude of one vector and the
scalar component of the second vector along the direction of the
first vector. Note that 
"
"
"
which means that the scalar
product obeys the commutative law.
In unit-vector notation,
"
" (ax # ay # az )"(bx # by # bz ),
(3-22)
which may be expanded according to the distributive law.
The Vector Product
The vector (or cross) product of two vectors
and 
is written 
' 
and is a vector
whose magnitude c is
given by
c " ab sin f,
(3-24)
in which f is the smaller of the angles between the directions of 
and 
. The direction of 
is perpendicular to the plane 
defined by 
and 
and is given by a right-hand rule, as shown in
Fig. 3-19. Note that 
'
" $(
'
), which means that the vec-
tor product does not obey the commutative law.
In unit-vector notation,
'
" (ax # ay # az ) ' (bx # by # bz ),
(3-26)
which we may expand with the distributive law.

We next evaluate each term with Eq. 3-24, finding the
direction with the right-hand rule. For the first term here,
the angle f between the two vectors being crossed is 0. For
the other terms, f is 90°.We find
" $6(0) # 9($ ) # 8($ ) $ 12
" $12 $ 9 $ 8 .
