done on the safe by the normal force 
from the floor?
KEY IDEA
Because these forces are constant in both magnitude and
direction, we can find the work they do with Eq. 7-7.
Calculations: Thus, with mg as the magnitude of the gravi-
tational force, we write
Wg " mgd cos 903 " mgd(0) " 0
(Answer)
and
WN " FNd cos 903 " FNd(0) " 0.
(Answer)
We should have known this result. Because these forces are
perpendicular to the displacement of the safe, they do zero
work on the safe and do not transfer any energy to or from it.
(c) The safe is initially stationary. What is its speed vf at the
end of the 8.50 m displacement?
KEY IDEA
The speed of the safe changes because its kinetic energy is
changed when energy is transferred to it by 
and

These statements are known traditionally as the work–kinetic energy theorem
for particles.They hold for both positive and negative work: If the net work done
on a particle is positive, then the particle’s kinetic energy increases by the amount
of the work. If the net work done is negative, then the particle’s kinetic energy
decreases by the amount of the work.
For example, if the kinetic energy of a particle is initially 5 J and there is a
net transfer of 2 J to the particle (positive net work), the final kinetic energy is
7 J. If, instead, there is a net transfer of 2 J from the particle (negative net work),
the final kinetic energy is 3 J.

CHAPTER 7
KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK
Checkpoint 1
A particle moves along an x axis. Does the kinetic energy of the particle increase, de-
crease, or remain the same if the particle’s velocity changes (a) from $3 m/s to $2 m/s
and (b) from $2 m/s to 2 m/s? (c) In each situation, is the work done on the particle
positive, negative, or zero?

10.0 N at 40.03 above the horizontal.The magnitudes and di-
rections of these forces do not change as the safe moves, and
the floor and safe make frictionless contact.
(a) What is the net work done on the safe by forces 
and 
during the displacement ?
KEY IDEAS
(1) The net work W done on the safe by the two forces is the
sum of the works they do individually. (2) Because we can
treat the safe as a particle and the forces are constant in
both magnitude and direction, we can use either Eq. 7-7 
(W " Fd cos f) or Eq. 7-8 
to calculate those
works. Let’s choose Eq. 7-7.
Calculations: From Eq. 7-7 and the free-body diagram for
the safe in Fig. 7-4b, the work done by 
is
W1 " F1d cos f1 " (12.0 N)(8.50 m)(cos 30.03)
" 88.33 J,
and the work done by 
is
W2 " F2d cos f2 " (10.0 N)(8.50 m)(cos 40.03)
" 65.11 J.
Thus, the net work W is
W " W1 # W2 " 88.33 J # 65.11 J
" 153.4 J % 153 J.
(Answer)
During the 8.50 m displacement, therefore, the spies transfer
153 J of energy to the kinetic energy of the safe.
