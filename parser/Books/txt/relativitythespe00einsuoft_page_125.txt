DIFFICULTIES  OF  NEWTON'S  THEORY  107 
distasteful  conception  that  the  material  universe  ought 
to  possess  something  of  the  nature  of  a  centre.  Of 
course  we  purchase  our  emancipation  from  the  funda 
mental  difficulties  mentioned,  at  the  cost  of  a  modifica 
tion  and  complication  of  Newton's  law  which  has 
neither  empirical  nor  theoretical  foundation.  We  can 
imagine  innumerable  laws  which  would  serve  the  same 
purpose,  without  our  being  able  to  state  a  reason  why 
one  of  them  is  to  be  preferred  to  the  others  ;  for  any 
one  of  these  laws  would  be  founded  just  as  little  on 
more  general  theoretical  principles  as  is  the  law  of 
Newton.
