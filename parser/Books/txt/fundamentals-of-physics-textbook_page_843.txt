Sample Problem 28.04
Uniform circular motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field
Figure 28-12 shows the essentials of a mass spectrometer,
which can be used to measure the mass of an ion; an ion of
mass m (to be measured) and charge q is produced in source
S. The initially stationary ion is accelerated by the electric
field due to a potential difference V.The ion leaves S and en-
ters a separator chamber in which a uniform magnetic field 
is perpendicular to the path of the ion. A wide detector lines
the bottom wall of the chamber, and the 
causes the ion to
move in a semicircle and thus strike the detector. Suppose
that B ! 80.000 mT, V ! 1000.0 V, and ions of charge q !
&1.6022 $ 10%19 C strike the detector at a point that lies at 
x ! 1.6254 m. What is the mass m of the individual ions, in
atomic mass units (Eq.1-7:1 u ! 1.6605 $ 10%27 kg)?
KEY IDEAS
(1) Because the (uniform) magnetic field causes the
(charged) ion to follow a circular path, we can relate the ion’s
mass m to the path’s radius r with Eq. 28-16 (r ! mv/
B).

28.27 Describe how a cyclotron works, and in a sketch
indicate a particle’s path and the regions where the kinetic
energy is increased.
28.28 Identify the resonance condition.
28.29 For a cyclotron, apply the relationship between the par-
ticle’s mass and charge, the magnetic field, and the fre-
quency of circling.
28.30 Distinguish between a cyclotron and a synchrotron.
Learning Objectives
●In a cyclotron, charged particles are accelerated by elec-
tric forces as they circle in a magnetic field.
●A synchrotron is needed for particles accelerated to nearly
the speed of light.
Key Ideas
From Fig. 28-12 we see that r ! x/2 (the radius is half the
diameter). From the problem statement, we know the magni-
tude B of the magnetic field. However, we lack the ion’s
speed v in the magnetic field after the ion has been acceler-
ated due to the potential difference V. (2) To relate v and V,
we use the fact that mechanical energy (Emec ! K & U) is
conserved during the acceleration.
Finding speed: When the ion emerges from the source, its
kinetic energy is approximately zero. At the end of the 
acceleration, its kinetic energy is 
. Also, during the ac-
celeration, the positive ion moves through a change in 
potential of %V.Thus, because the ion has positive charge q,
its potential energy changes by %qV. If we now write the
conservation of mechanical energy as
