CHAPTER 10
ROTATION
Calculations: To sketch the disk and its reference line at a
particular time, we need to determine u for that time. To do
so, we substitute the time into Eq. 10-9. For t ! %2.0 s, we get
This means that at t ! %2.0 s the reference line on the disk
is rotated counterclockwise from the zero position by angle
1.2 rad ! 69# (counterclockwise because u is positive). Sketch
1 in Fig.10-5b shows this position of the reference line.
Similarly, for t ! 0, we find u ! %1.00 rad ! %57#,
which means that the reference line is rotated clockwise
from the zero angular position by 1.0 rad, or 57#, as shown
in sketch 3. For t ! 4.0 s, we find u ! 0.60 rad ! 34#
(sketch 5). Drawing sketches for when the curve crosses
the t axis is easy, because then u ! 0 and the reference line
is momentarily aligned with the zero angular position
(sketches 2 and 4).
(b) At what time tmin does u(t) reach the minimum 
value shown in Fig. 10-5b? What is that minimum value?
! 1.2 rad ! 1.2 rad 360#
20 rad ! 69#.
u ! %1.00 % (0.600)(%2.0) & (0.250)(%2.0)2
Sample Problem 10.01
Angular velocity derived from angular position
The disk in Fig. 10-5a is rotating about its central axis like a
merry-go-round. The angular position u(t) of a reference
line on the disk is given by
u ! %1.00 % 0.600t & 0.250t2,
(10-9)
with t in seconds, u in radians, and the zero angular position
as indicated in the figure. (If you like, you can translate all
this into Chapter 2 notation by momentarily dropping the
word “angular” from “angular position” and replacing the
symbol u with the symbol x.What you then have is an equa-
tion that gives the position as a function of time, for the one-
dimensional motion of Chapter 2.)
(a) Graph the angular position of the disk versus time
from t ! %3.0 s to t ! 5.4 s. Sketch the disk and its angular
position reference line at t ! %2.0 s, 0 s, and 4.0 s, and
when the curve crosses the t axis.
KEY IDEA
The angular position of the disk is the angular position 
u(t) of its reference line,which is given by Eq.10-9 as a function
of time t.So we graph Eq.10-9;the result is shown in Fig.10-5b.

The angular position
of the disk is the angle
between these two lines.
Now, the disk is
at a zero angle.
θ
At t = −2 s, the disk
is at a positive
(counterclockwise)
angle. So, a positive
   value is plotted.
This is a plot of the angle
of the disk versus time.
Now, it is at a
negative (clockwise)
angle. So, a negative
   value is plotted.
θ
It has reversed
its rotation and
is again at a
zero angle.
Now, it is
back at a
positive
angle.

ence line on the disk for five points on the curve. (c) A plot of the disk’s angular velocity v(t). Positive values of v correspond to
counterclockwise rotation, and negative values to clockwise rotation.
