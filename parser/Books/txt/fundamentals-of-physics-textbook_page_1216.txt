CHAPTER 39
MORE ABOUT MATTER WAVES
When an electron reaches an excited state, it does not stay there but quickly
de-excites by decreasing its energy. Figures 39-4b to d represent some of the possi-
ble quantum jumps down from the energy level of the third excited state. The
electron can reach its ground-state level either with one direct quantum jump
(Fig. 39-4b) or with shorter jumps via intermediate levels (Figs. 39-4c and d).
An electron can decrease its energy by emitting a photon but only this way:
Checkpoint 1
Rank the following pairs of quantum states for an electron confined to an infinite well
according to the energy differences between the states, greatest first: (a) n ! 3 and
n ! 1, (b) n ! 5 and n ! 4, (c) n ! 4 and n ! 3.
If a confined electron emits a photon,the energy hf of that photon must equal the
energy difference )E between the initial energy level of the electron and a lower level.
Thus, Eq. 39-6 applies to both the absorption and the emission of light by
a confined electron. That is, the absorbed or emitted light can have only certain
values of hf and thus only certain values of frequency f and wavelength l.
Aside: Although Eq. 39-6 and what we have discussed about photon absorption
and emission can be applied to physical (real) electron traps, they actually cannot be
applied to one-dimensional (unreal) electron traps.The reason involves the need to
conserve angular momentum in a photon absorption or emission process. In this
book,we shall neglect that need and use Eq.39-6 even for one-dimensional traps.
KEY IDEA
First a caution: Note that,from Fig.39-3,the second excited state
corresponds to the third energy level, with quantum number 
n ! 3.Then if the electron is to jump from the n ! 1 level to the
n ! 3 level, the required change in its energy is, from Eq. 39-5,
)E31 ! E3 # E1.
(39-8)
Upward jump: The energies E3 and E1 depend on the
quantum number n, according to Eq. 39-4. Therefore, sub-
stituting that equation into Eq. 39-8 for energies E3 and E1
and using Eq. 39-7 lead to
(Answer)
(c) If the electron gains the energy for the jump from energy
level E1 to energy level E3 by absorbing light, what light
wavelength is required?
KEY IDEAS
(1) If light is to transfer energy to the electron, the transfer
must be by photon absorption. (2) The photonâ€™s energy must
equal the energy difference )E between the initial energy

Sample Problem 39.01
Energy levels in a 1D infinite potential well
An electron is confined to a one-dimensional, infinitely
deep potential energy well of width L ! 100 pm. (a) What is
the smallest amount of energy the electron can have? (A
trapped electron cannot have zero energy.)
KEY IDEA
Confinement of the electron (a matter wave) to the well leads
to quantization of its energy.Because the well is infinitely deep,
the allowed energies are given by Eq.39-4 (En ! (h2/8mL2)n2),
with the quantum number n a positive integer.
Lowest energy level: Here, the collection of constants in
front of n2 in Eq. 39-4 is evaluated as
(39-7)
The smallest amount of energy the electron can have corre-
sponds to the lowest quantum number, which is n ! 1 for the
ground state of the electron.Thus, Eqs. 39-4 and 39-7 give us
(Answer)
(b) How much energy must be transferred to the electron if it
is to make a quantum jump from its ground state to its second
excited state?
