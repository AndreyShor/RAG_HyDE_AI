The net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface in Fig. 25-16b is q # q-, so
Gauss’ law now gives
(25-32)
or
(25-33)
The effect of the dielectric is to weaken the original field E0 by a factor of k; so we
may write
(25-34)
Comparison of Eqs. 25-33 and 25-34 shows that
(25-35)
Equation 25-35 shows correctly that the magnitude q- of the induced surface
charge is less than that of the free charge q and is zero if no dielectric is present
(because then k ! 1 in Eq. 25-35).
By substituting for q # q- from Eq. 25-35 in Eq. 25-32, we can write Gauss’
law in the form
(Gauss’ law with dielectric).
(25-36)
This equation, although derived for a parallel-plate capacitor, is true generally
and is the most general form in which Gauss’ law can be written. Note:
1. The flux integral now involves 
not just 
(The vector 
is sometimes 
called the electric displacement
so that Eq. 25-36 can be written in the form
2. The charge q enclosed by the Gaussian surface is now taken to be the free
charge only. The induced surface charge is deliberately ignored on the right
side of Eq. 25-36, having been taken fully into account by introducing the
dielectric constant k on the left side.
3. Equation 25-36 differs from Eq. 23-7, our original statement of Gauss’ law,
only in that +0 in the latter equation has been replaced by k+0. We keep k
inside the integral of Eq. 25-36 to allow for cases in which k is not constant
over the entire Gaussian surface.

CAPACITANCE
Sample Problem 25.06
Dielectric partially filling the gap in a capacitor
Figure 25-17 shows a parallel-plate capacitor of plate area
A and plate separation d. A potential difference V0 is ap-
plied between the plates by connecting a battery between
them.The battery is then disconnected, and a dielectric slab
of thickness b and dielectric constant k is placed between
the plates as shown. Assume A ! 115 cm2, d ! 1.24 cm,
V0 ! 85.5 V, b ! 0.780 cm, and k ! 2.61.
(a) What is the capacitance C0 before the dielectric slab is
inserted?
