Gauss’ Law
Gauss’ law and Coulomb’s law are different ways
of describing the relation between charge and electric field in static
situations. Gauss’ law is
´0& $ qenc
(Gauss’ law),
(23-6)
in which qenc is the net charge inside an imaginary closed surface (a
Gaussian surface) and & is the net flux of the electric field through
the surface:
(23-4)
Coulomb’s law can be derived from Gauss’ law.
Applications of Gauss’ Law
Using Gauss’ law and, in some
cases, symmetry arguments, we can derive several important
results in electrostatic situations.Among these are:
1. An excess charge on an isolated conductor is located entirely on
the outer surface of the conductor.
2. The external electric field near the surface of a charged conductor
is perpendicular to the surface and has a magnitude that depends
on the surface charge density s:
(conducting surface).
(23-11)
Within the conductor, E $ 0.
3. The electric field at any point due to an infinite line of charge

with uniform linear charge density l is perpendicular to the line
of charge and has magnitude
(line of charge),
(23-12)
where r is the perpendicular distance from the line of charge to
the point.
4. The electric field due to an infinite nonconducting sheet with
uniform surface charge density s is perpendicular to the plane
of the sheet and has magnitude
(sheet of charge).
(23-13)
5. The electric field outside a spherical shell of charge with radius R
and total charge q is directed radially and has magnitude
(spherical shell, for r - R).
(23-15)
Here r is the distance from the center of the shell to the point at
which E is measured.(The charge behaves,for external points,as if
it were all located at the center of the sphere.) The field inside a
uniform spherical shell of charge is exactly zero:
E $ 0
(spherical shell, for r , R).
