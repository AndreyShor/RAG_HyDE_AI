Entropy
•1
Suppose 4.00 mol of an ideal gas undergoes a reversible
SSM
isothermal expansion from volume V1 to volume V2 # 2.00V1 at tem-
perature T # 400 K. Find (a) the work done by the gas and (b) the
entropy change of the gas. (c) If the expansion is reversible and adia-
batic instead of isothermal,what is the entropy change of the gas?
•2
An ideal gas undergoes a reversible isothermal expansion at
77.0 C, increasing its volume from 1.30 L to 3.40 L. The entropy
change of the gas is 22.0 J/K. How many moles of gas are present?
•3
A 2.50 mol sample of an ideal gas expands reversibly and
isothermally at 360 K until its volume is doubled. What is the in-
crease in entropy of the gas?
•4
How much energy must be transferred as heat for a reversible
isothermal expansion of an ideal gas at 132 C if the entropy of the
gas increases by 46.0 J/K?
•5
Find (a) the energy absorbed as heat and (b) the change in
entropy of a 2.00 kg block of copper whose temperature is in-
creased reversibly from 25.0-C to 100-C. The specific heat of cop-
per is 386 J/kg9K.

(a) What is the entropy change of a 12.0 g ice cube that melts
completely in a bucket of water whose temperature is just above
the freezing point of water? (b) What is the entropy change of a
5.00 g spoonful of water that evaporates completely on a hot plate
whose temperature is slightly above the boiling point of water?
••7
A 50.0 g block of copper whose temperature is 400 K is
placed in an insulating box with a 100 g block of lead whose temper-
ature is 200 K. (a) What is the equilibrium temperature of the two-
block system? (b) What is the change in the internal energy of the
system between the initial state and the equilibrium state? (c) What
is the change in the entropy of the system? (See Table 18-3.)

At very low temperatures, the molar specific heat CV of
many solids is approximately CV # AT 3, where A depends on the
particular substance. For aluminum,

Find the entropy change for 4.00 mol of aluminum when its tem-
perature is raised from 5.00 K to 10.0 K.
••9
A 10 g ice cube at $10-C is placed in a lake whose
temperature is 15-C. Calculate the change in entropy of the
cube–lake system as the ice cube comes to thermal equilibrium
with the lake.The specific heat of ice is 2220 J/kg9K. (Hint: Will the
ice cube affect the lake temperature?)

A 364 g block is
put in contact with a ther-
mal reservoir. The block
is initially at a lower tem-
perature than the reser-
voir. Assume that the
consequent transfer of
energy as heat from the
reservoir to the block is
reversible. Figure 20-22

In the irreversible process of Fig. 20-5, let the initial temper-
atures of the identical blocks L and R be 305.5 and 294.5 K,
respectively, and let 215 J be the energy that must be transferred 
between the blocks in order to reach equilibrium. For the
reversible processes of Fig. 20-6, what is 
for (a) block L, (b) its
reservoir, (c) block R, (d) its reservoir, (e) the two-block system,
and (f) the system of the two blocks and the two reservoirs?
••14
(a) For 1.0 mol of a
monatomic ideal gas taken through
the cycle in Fig. 20-24, where V1 #
4.00V0, what is W/p0V0 as the gas
goes from state a to state c along
path abc? What is %Eint/p0V0 in go-
ing (b) from b to c and (c) through
one full cycle? What is %S in going
(d) from b to c and (e) through one
full cycle?
••15
A mixture of 1773 g of water and 227 g of ice is in an initial
equilibrium state at 0.000-C. The mixture is then, in a reversible
process, brought to a second equilibrium state where the water–ice
ratio, by mass, is 1.00!1.00 at 0.000-C. (a) Calculate the entropy
change of the system during this process. (The heat of fusion for wa-
ter is 333 kJ/kg.) (b) The system is then returned to the initial equi-
librium state in an irreversible process (say, by using a Bunsen
burner). Calculate the entropy change of the system during this
process. (c) Are your answers consistent with the second law of
thermodynamics?
