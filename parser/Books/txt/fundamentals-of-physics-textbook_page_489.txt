16-6 PHASORS
Figure 16-15 (a)–(d) A phasor of magnitude ym1 rotating about an origin at angular speed v represents a sinusoidal wave.The phasor’s
projection y1 on the vertical axis represents the displacement of a point through which the wave passes. (e) A second phasor, also of
angular speed v but of magnitude ym2 and rotating at a constant angle f from the first phasor, represents a second wave, with a phase
constant f. (f) The resultant wave is represented by the vector sum y,m of the two phasors.

The next crest is about to
move through the dot.
This is a snapshot of the
two phasors for two waves.
These are the
projections of
the two phasors.
Wave 1
This is the
projection of
the resultant
phasor.
Adding the two phasors as vectors
gives the resultant phasor of the
resultant wave.
Wave 2, delayed
by
radians
φ
This projection matches this
displacement of the dot as
the wave moves through it.
