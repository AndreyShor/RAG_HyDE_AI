plane and thus cannot affect the motion along the plane. (It
has no component along the plane to accelerate the box.)
We are now ready to write Newton’s second law for mo-
tion along the tilted x axis:
The component ax is the only component of the acceleration
(the box is not leaping up from the plane, which would be
strange, or descending into the plane, which would be even
stranger).So,let’s simply write a for the acceleration along the
plane. Because 
is in the positive x direction and the compo-
nent mg sin u is in the negative x direction,we next write
T $ mg sin u " ma.
(5-24)
Substituting data and solving for a, we find
a " 0.100 m/s2.
(Answer)
The result is positive,indicating that the box accelerates up the
inclined plane, in the positive direction of the tilted x axis. If

That direction means that only a component of the force is
along the plane, and only that component (not the full force)
affects the box’s acceleration along the plane.Thus, before we
can write Newton’s second law for motion along the x axis, we
need to find an expression for that important component.
Figures 5-15c to h indicate the steps that lead to the ex-
pression. We start with the given angle of the plane and
work our way to a triangle of the force components (they
are the legs of the triangle and the full force is the hy-
potenuse). Figure 5-15c shows that the angle between the
ramp and 
is 903 $ u. (Do you see a right triangle there?)

Next, Figs. 5-15d to f show 
and its components: One com-
ponent is parallel to the plane (that is the one we want) and
the other is perpendicular to the plane.
Because the perpendicular component is perpendicular,
the angle between it and 
must be u (Fig. 5-15d).The com-
ponent we want is the far leg of the component right trian-
gle. The magnitude of the hypotenuse is mg (the magnitude
of the gravitational force).Thus, the component we want has
magnitude mg sin u (Fig. 5-15g).
We have one more force to consider, the normal force
shown in Fig. 5-15b. However, it is perpendicular to the

Reading a force graph
Here is an example of where you must dig information out
of a graph, not just read off a number. In Fig. 5-16a, two
forces are applied to a 4.00 kg block on a frictionless floor,
but only force 
is indicated. That force has a fixed magni-
tude but can be applied at an adjustable angle to the posi-
tive direction of the x axis. Force 
is horizontal and fixed in
both magnitude and angle. Figure 5-16b gives the horizontal
acceleration ax of the block for any given value of u from 03
to 903.What is the value of ax for u " 1803?
KEY IDEAS
(1) The horizontal acceleration ax depends on the net hori-
zontal force Fnet, x, as given by Newton’s second law. (2) The
net horizontal force is the sum of the horizontal compo-
nents of forces 
and 
.
Calculations: The x component of 
is F2 because the vector
is horizontal. The x component of 
is F1 cos . Using these
expressions and a mass m of 4.00 kg, we can write Newton’s
second law (
m ) for motion along the x axis as
F1 cos u # F2 " 4.00ax.
(5-25)
From this equation we see that when angle u " 903, F1 cos u
is zero and F2 " 4.00ax. From the graph we see that the

From Eq. 5-25, we find that when u " 03,
F1 cos 03 # 2.00 " 4.00ax.
(5-26)
From the graph we see that the corresponding acceleration
is 3.0 m/s2. From Eq. 5-26, we then find that F1 " 10 N.
Substituting F1 " 10 N, F2 " 2.00 N, and u " 1803 into
Eq. 5-25 leads to
ax " $2.00 m/s2.
