We want the reflected waves
to be out of phase. They
already are out of phase
because of the reflection
shifts. So, we don’t want
the path length difference
2L to change that. Thus,
2L = (integer)l/n2.
Here again, the waves are
already out of phase by the
reflection shifts. So, the
path length difference must
be 2L = (integer)l/n2, but 
with the larger L.
Total reflection
shift = 0.5
wavelength.
So, the reflections
put the waves
out of phase.

This dark fringe is due to fully
destructive interference. So,
the reflected rays must be
out of phase.
Here too, the dark fringe
means that the reflected
waves are out of phase.
The path length
difference (down
and back up) is 2L.
The path length
difference is 2L
here too but the
L is larger.

Figure 35-20 (a) Red light is incident on a thin, air-filled wedge in the side of a transparent plastic block.The thickness of the
wedge is LL at the left end and LR at the right end. (b) The view from above the block: an interference pattern of six dark fringes
and five bright red fringes lies over the region of the wedge. (c) A representation of the incident ray i, reflected rays r1 and r2, and
thickness L of the wedge anywhere along the length of the wedge.The reflection rays at the (d) left and (f) right ends of the
wedge and (e) their organizing table.
