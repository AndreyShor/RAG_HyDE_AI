Applying Gauss’ Law: Planar Symmetry
Nonconducting Sheet
Figure 23-17 shows a portion of a thin, infinite, nonconducting sheet with a uni-
form (positive) surface charge density s. A sheet of thin plastic wrap, uniformly
charged on one side, can serve as a simple model. Let us find the electric field 
a distance r in front of the sheet.
A useful Gaussian surface is a closed cylinder with end caps of area A,
arranged to pierce the sheet perpendicularly as shown. From symmetry,
must
be perpendicular to the sheet and hence to the end caps. Furthermore, since the
charge is positive,
is directed away from the sheet, and thus the electric field
lines pierce the two Gaussian end caps in an outward direction. Because the field
lines do not pierce the curved surface, there is no flux through this portion of the
Gaussian surface.Thus 
is simply E dA; then Gauss’ law,
becomes
where sA is the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface.This gives
(sheet of charge).
(23-13)
Since we are considering an infinite sheet with uniform charge density, this result
holds for any point at a finite distance from the sheet. Equation 23-13 agrees with
Eq.22-27,which we found by integration of electric field components.
