A pitot tube (see Problem 62) on a high-altitude aircraft
measures a differential pressure of 180 Pa. What is the aircraft’s
airspeed if the density of the air is 0.031 kg/m3?

In Fig. 14-49, water flows
through a horizontal pipe and then out
into the atmosphere at a speed v1 ! 15
m/s.The diameters of the left and right
sections of the pipe are 5.0 cm and 3.0
cm. (a) What volume of water flows
into the atmosphere during a 10 min period? In the left section of the
pipe,what are (b) the speed v2 and (c) the gauge pressure?
••65
A venturi meter is used to measure the flow
speed of a fluid in a pipe. The meter is connected between two
sections of the pipe (Fig. 14-50); the cross-sectional area A of the
entrance and exit of the meter matches the pipe’s cross-sectional
area. Between the entrance and exit, the fluid flows from the
pipe with speed V and then through a narrow “throat” of cross-
sectional area a with speed v. A manometer connects the wider
portion of the meter to the narrower portion. The change in the
fluid’s speed is accompanied by a change 'p in the fluid’s pressure,
which causes a height difference h of the liquid in the two arms of
the manometer. (Here 'p means pressure in the throat minus pres-
sure in the pipe.) (a) By applying Bernoulli’s equation and the
equation of continuity to points 1 and 2 in Fig. 14-50, show that

where r is the density of the fluid. (b) Suppose that the fluid is
fresh water, that the cross-sectional areas are 64 cm2 in the pipe
and 32 cm2 in the throat, and that the pressure is 55 kPa in the pipe
and 41 kPa in the throat. What is the rate of water flow in cubic
meters per second?

opening. (a) Find the magnitude of the
frictional force between plug and pipe
wall. (b) The plug is removed. What
water volume exits the pipe in 3.0 h?
••68
Fresh water flows horizontally
from pipe section 1 of cross-sectional
area A1 into pipe section 2 of cross-sec-
tional area A2. Figure 14-52 gives a plot
of the pressure difference p2 % p1 versus
the inverse area squared 
that
would be expected for a volume flow
rate of a certain value if the water flow
were laminar under all circumstances.
The scale on the vertical axis is set by
∆ps ! 300 kN/m2. For the conditions
of the figure, what are the values of
(a) A2 and (b) the volume flow rate?

A liquid of density 900 kg/m3
flows through a horizontal pipe that
has a cross-sectional area of 1.90 $ 10%2 m2 in region A and a
A%2
1
cross-sectional area of 9.50 $ 10%2 m2 in region B. The pressure
difference between the two regions is 7.20 $ 103 Pa. What are (a)
the volume flow rate and (b) the mass flow rate?
••70
In Fig. 14-53, water flows
steadily from the left pipe section
(radius r1 ! 2.00R), through the mid-
dle section (radius R), and into the
right section (radius r3 ! 3.00R). The
speed of the water in the middle sec-
tion is 0.500 m/s. What is the net work done on 0.400 m3 of the wa-
ter as it moves from the left section to the right section?

Figure 14-54 shows a stream of
water flowing through a hole at depth
h ! 10 cm in a tank holding water to
height H ! 40 cm. (a) At what dis-
tance x does the stream strike the
floor? (b) At what depth should a sec-
ond hole be made to give the same
value of x? (c) At what depth should a
hole be made to maximize x?

A very simplified schem-
atic of the rain drainage system for a home is shown in Fig. 14-55.
Rain falling on the slanted roof runs off into gutters around the
roof edge; it then drains through downspouts (only one is
shown) into a main drainage pipe M below the basement, which

Consider the venturi tube of Problem 65 and Fig. 14-50
without the manometer.Let A equal 5a. Suppose the pressure p1 at A
is 2.0 atm. Compute the values of (a) the speed V at A and (b) the
speed v at a that make the pressure p2 at a equal to zero.(c) Compute
the corresponding volume flow rate if the diameter at A is 5.0 cm.
The phenomenon that occurs at a when p2 falls to nearly zero is
known as cavitation.The water vaporizes into small bubbles.
