RODS  AND  CLOCKS  IN  MOTION        87 
As  judged  from  K,  the  clock  is  moving  with  the 
velocity  v  ;  as  judged  from  this  reference-body,  the 
time  which  elapses  between  two  strokes  of  the  clock 
i 
is   not  one  second,  but     /      t>a  seconds,  i.e.  a  some- 
what  larger  time.  As  a  consequence  of  its  motion 
the  clock  goes  more  slowly  than  when  at  rest.  Here 
also  the  velocity  c  plays  the  part  of  an  unattainable 
limiting  velocity.
