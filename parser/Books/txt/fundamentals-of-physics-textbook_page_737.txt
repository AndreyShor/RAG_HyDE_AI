an electric dipole, on the positive side of the dipole. (The origin of z
is at the center of the dipole.) The particle is then moved along a
circular path around the dipole center until it is at coordinate z $
'20 nm, on the negative side of the dipole axis. Figure 24-41b gives
the work Wa done by the force moving the particle versus the angle u
that locates the particle relative to the positive direction of the z
axis.The scale of the vertical axis is set by Was $ 4.0 ( 10'30 J.What
is the magnitude of the dipole moment?

(a) Figure 24-42a shows a nonconducting rod of length L $
6.00 cm and uniform linear charge density l $ "3.68 pC/m.Assume
that the electric potential is defined to be V $ 0 at infinity.What is V
at point P at distance d $ 8.00 cm along the rod’s perpendicular bi-
sector? (b) Figure 24-42b shows an identical rod except that one half
is now negatively charged. Both halves have a linear charge density
of magnitude 3.68 pC/m.With V $ 0 at infinity,what is V at P?
is the net electric potential at the
rectangle’s center? (Hint: Thought-
ful examination of the arrangement
can reduce the calculation.)

Two charged particles are
shown in Fig. 24-39a. Particle 1, with
charge q1, is fixed in place at distance d. Particle 2, with charge q2,
can be moved along the x axis. Figure 24-39b gives the net electric
potential V at the origin due to the two particles as a function of
the x coordinate of particle 2. The scale of the x axis is set by xs
16.0 cm.The plot has an asymptote of V $ 5.76 ( 10'7 V as x : 0.
