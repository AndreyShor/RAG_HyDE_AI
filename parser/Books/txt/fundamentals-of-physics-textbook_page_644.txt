Checkpoint 3
The figure here shows three arrangements of an electron e and two
protons p.(a) Rank the arrangements according to the magnitude of the
net electrostatic force on the electron due to the protons,largest first.(b) In
situation c,is the angle between the net force on the electron and the line
labeled d less than or more than 45-?

Calculations: With Eq.21-4,we can now rewrite Eq.21-9:
(21-10)
(Note that only the charge magnitudes appear in Eq.
21-10.We already decided about the directions of the forces
in drawing Fig. 21-8d and do not want to include any posi-
tive or negative signs here.) Rearranging Eq. 21-10 gives us
After taking the square roots of both sides, we find
x # 2L.
(Answer)
The equilibrium at x # 2L is unstable;that is,if the proton is
displaced leftward from point R, then F1 and F2 both increase
but F2 increases more (because q2 is closer than q1), and a net
force will drive the proton farther leftward. If the proton is dis-
placed rightward, both F1 and F2 decrease but F2 decreases
more, and a net force will then drive the proton farther right-
ward.In a stable equilibrium,if the proton is displaced slightly,it
returns to the equilibrium position.

Sample Problem 21.02
Equilibrium of two forces on a particle
Figure 21-8a shows two particles fixed in place: a particle of
charge q1 # "8q at the origin and a particle of charge q2 # $2q
at x # L. At what point (other than infinitely far away) can a
proton be placed so that it is in equilibrium (the net force on it is
zero)? Is that equilibrium stable or unstable? (That is, if the pro-
ton is displaced, do the forces drive it back to the point of equi-
librium or drive it farther away?)
KEY IDEA
If 
is the force on the proton due to charge q1 and 
is the
force on the proton due to charge q2,then the point we seek is
where 
Thus,
(21-8)
This tells us that at the point we seek, the forces acting on
the proton due to the other two particles must be of equal
magnitudes,
F1 # F2,
(21-9)
and that the forces must have opposite directions.
Reasoning: Because a proton has a positive charge, the pro-
ton and the particle of charge q1 are of the same sign, and
force 
on the proton must point away from q1. Also, the
proton and the particle of charge q2 are of opposite signs, so
force 
on the proton must point toward q2.“Away from q1”
and “toward q2” can be in opposite directions only if the pro-
ton is located on the x axis.
If the proton is on the x axis at any point between q1 and
q2, such as point P in Fig. 21-8b, then 
and 
are in the
same direction and not in opposite directions as required.
If the proton is at any point on the x axis to the left of q1,
such as point S in Fig. 21-8c, then 
and 
are in opposite
directions. However, Eq. 21-4 tells us that 
and 
can-
not have equal magnitudes there: F1 must be greater than F2,
because F1 is produced by a closer charge (with lesser r) of
greater magnitude (8q versus 2q).
Finally, if the proton is at any point on the x axis to the
right of q2, such as point R in Fig. 21-8d, then 
and 
are
again in opposite directions. However, because now the
charge of greater magnitude (q1) is farther away from the pro-
ton than the charge of lesser magnitude, there is a point at
which F1 is equal to F2. Let x be the coordinate of this point,
and let qp be the charge of the proton.
