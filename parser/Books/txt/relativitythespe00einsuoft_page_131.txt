THE   STRUCTURE   OF   SPACE   ACCORDING   TO 
THE  GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
ACCORDING  to  the  general  theory  of  relativity, 
the  geometrical  properties  of  space  are  not  in 
dependent,  but  they  are  determined  by  matter. 
Thus  we  can  draw  conclusions  about  the  geometrical 
structure  of  the  universe  only  if  we  base  our  considera 
tions  on  the  state  of  the  matter  as  being  something 
that  is  known.  We  know  from  experience  that,  for  a 
suitably  chosen  co-ordinate  system,  the  velocities  of 
the  stars  are  small  as  compared  with  the  velocity  of 
transmission  of  light.  We  can  thus  as  a  rough  ap 
proximation  arrive  at  a  conclusion  as  to  the  nature  of 
the  universe  as  a  whole,  if  we  treat  the  matter  as  being 
at  rest. 
We  already  know  from  our  previous  discussion  that  the 
behaviour  of  measuring-rods  and  clocks  is  influenced  by 
gravitational  fields,  i.e.  by  the  distribution  of  matter. 
This  in  itself  is  sufficient  to  exclude  the  possibility  of 
the  exact  validity  of  Euclidean  geometry  in  our  uni 
verse.  But  it  is  conceivable  that  our  universe  differs 
only  slightly  from  a  Euclidean  one,  and  this  notion 
seems  all  the  more  probable,  since  calculations  show 
that  the  metrics  of  surrounding  space  is  influenced  only 
to  an  exceedingly  small  extent  by  masses  even  of  the
