(Answer)
That is only about one-seventh the thickness of a book page.
Obviously, the displacement amplitude of even the loudest
sound that the ear can tolerate is very small. Temporary ex-
posure to such loud sound produces temporary hearing loss,
probably due to a decrease in blood supply to the inner ear.
Prolonged exposure produces permanent damage.
The pressure amplitude %pm for the faintest detectable
sound at 1000 Hz is 2.8 ' 10$5 Pa. Proceeding as above
leads to sm # 1.1 ' 10$11 m or 11 pm, which is about one-
tenth the radius of a typical atom. The ear is indeed a sensi-
tive detector of sound waves.

Sample Problem 17.01
Pressure amplitude, displacement amplitude
The maximum pressure amplitude pm that the human ear can
tolerate in loud sounds is about 28 Pa (which is very much less
than the normal air pressure of about 105 Pa). What is the dis-
placement amplitude sm for such a sound in air of density r #
1.21 kg/m3,at a frequency of 1000 Hz and a speed of 343 m/s?
KEY IDEA
The displacement amplitude sm of a sound wave is related to
the pressure amplitude %pm of the wave according to Eq.17-14.
Calculations: Solving that equation for sm yields
.
Substituting known data then gives us

17-3 INTERFERENCE
Learning Objectives
waves with the same amplitude, wavelength, and travel di-
rection, determine the type of interference between the
waves (fully destructive interference, fully constructive in-
terference, or indeterminate interference).
17.16 Convert a phase difference between radians, degrees,
and number of wavelengths.
●The interference of two sound waves with identical wave-
lengths passing through a common point depends on their phase
difference f there. If the sound waves were emitted in phase and
are traveling in approximately the same direction, f is given by
where %L is their path length difference. 
●Fully constructive interference occurs when f is an integer
multiple of 2p,

17.14 If two waves with the same wavelength begin in
phase but reach a common point by traveling along dif-
ferent paths, calculate their phase difference f at that
point by relating the path length difference %L to the
wavelength l.

Interference
Like transverse waves, sound waves can undergo interference. In fact, we can
write equations for the interference as we did in Module 16-5 for transverse
waves. Suppose two sound waves with the same amplitude and wavelength are
traveling in the positive direction of an x axis with a phase difference of f.We can
express the waves in the form of Eqs. 16-47 and 16-48 but, to be consistent with
Eq. 17-12, we use cosine functions instead of sine functions:
