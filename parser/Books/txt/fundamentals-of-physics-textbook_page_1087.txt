35-3 INTERFERENCE AND DOUBLE-SLIT INTENSITY 
Figure 35-12 A plot of Eq.35-22,showing the intensity of a double-slit interference pattern as a
function of the phase difference between the waves when they arrive from the two slits.I0 is
the (uniform) intensity that would appear on the screen if one slit were covered.The average
intensity of the fringe pattern is 2I0,and the maximum intensity (for coherent light) is 4I0.

which is just Eq. 35-16, the expression we derived earlier for the locations of the
fringe minima.
Figure 35-12, which is a plot of Eq. 35-22, shows the intensity of double-slit
interference patterns as a function of the phase difference f between the waves
at the screen.The horizontal solid line is I0, the (uniform) intensity on the screen
when one of the slits is covered up. Note in Eq. 35-22 and the graph that the
intensity I varies from zero at the fringe minima to 4I0 at the fringe maxima.
If the waves from the two sources (slits) were incoherent, so that no enduring
phase relation existed between them, there would be no fringe pattern and the
intensity would have the uniform value 2I0 for all points on the screen; the 
horizontal dashed line in Fig. 35-12 shows this uniform value.
Interference cannot create or destroy energy but merely redistributes it over
the screen.Thus, the average intensity on the screen must be the same 2I0 regard-
less of whether the sources are coherent. This follows at once from Eq. 35-22;
if we substitute , the average value of the cosine-squared function, this equation
reduces to Iavg
2I0.
Proof of Eqs. 35-22 and 35-23
We shall combine the electric field components E1 and E2, given by Eqs. 35-20
and 35-21, respectively, by the method of phasors as is discussed in Module 16-6.
In Fig. 35-13a, the waves with components E1 and E2 are represented by phasors
of magnitude E0 that rotate around the origin at angular speed v. The values
of E1 and E2 at any time are the projections of the corresponding phasors on the
vertical axis. Figure 35-13a shows the phasors and their projections at an arbitrary
time t. Consistent with Eqs. 35-20 and 35-21, the phasor for E1 has a rotation
angle vt and the phasor for E2 has a rotation angle vt ' f (it is phase-shifted
ahead of E1).As each phasor rotates, its projection on the vertical axis varies with
time in the same way that the sinusoidal functions of Eqs. 35-20 and 35-21 vary
with time.
To combine the field components E1 and E2 at any point P in Fig. 35-10, we
add their phasors vectorially, as shown in Fig. 35-13b.The magnitude of the vector
sum is the amplitude E of the resultant wave at point P, and that wave has a cer-
tain phase constant b.To find the amplitude E in Fig. 35-13b, we first note that the
two angles marked b are equal because they are opposite equal-length sides of
a triangle. From the theorem (for triangles) that an exterior angle (here f, as
shown in Fig. 35-13b) is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles (here
that sum is b ' b), we see that
