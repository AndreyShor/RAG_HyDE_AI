The distance traveled by the kaon between those two
events is related to its speed v and the time interval for
the travel by
(37-10)
With these ideas in mind, let us solve for the distance first
with classical physics and then with special relativity.
Classical physics: In classical physics we would find the
same distance and time interval (in Eq. 37-10) whether we
measured them from the kaon frame or from the laboratory
frame. Thus, we need not be careful about the frame in
which the measurements are made.To find the kaon’s travel
distance dcp according to classical physics, we first rewrite
Eq. 37-10 as
dcp ! v 2t,
(37-11)
where 2t is the time interval between the two events in 
either frame. Then, substituting 0.990c for v and 0.1237 ms
for 2t in Eq. 37-11, we find
(Answer)
This is how far the kaon would travel if classical physics
were correct at speeds close to c.
Special relativity: In special relativity we must be very care-
ful that both the distance and the time interval in Eq. 37-10 are
measured in the same reference frame—especially when the
speed is close to c, as here. Thus, to find the actual travel dis-

tance dsr of the kaon as measured from the laboratory frame
and according to special relativity,we rewrite Eq.37-10 as
dsr ! v 2t,
(37-12)
where
t is the time interval between the two events as
measured from the laboratory frame.
Before we can evaluate dsr in Eq. 37-12, we must find
2t.The 0.1237 ms time interval is a proper time because the
two events occur at the same location in the kaon frame—
namely, at the kaon itself. Therefore, let 2t0 represent this
proper time interval. Then we can use Eq. 37-9 (2t ! g 2t0)
for time dilation to find the time interval 2t as measured
from the laboratory frame. Using Eq. 37-8 to substitute for
g in Eq. 37-9 leads to
This is about seven times longer than the kaon’s proper
lifetime. That is, the kaon’s lifetime is about seven times
longer in the laboratory frame than in its own frame—the
kaon’s lifetime is dilated. We can now evaluate Eq. 37-12
for the travel distance dsr in the laboratory frame as
(Answer)
This is about seven times dcp.Experiments like the one outlined
here, which verify special relativity, became routine in physics
laboratories decades ago.The engineering design and the con-
struction of any scientific or medical facility that employs high-
speed particles must take relativity into account.

37-2 THE RELATIVITY OF LENGTH
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
37.11 Identify that because spatial and temporal separations
are entangled, measurements of the lengths of objects
may be different in two frames with relative motion.
37.12 Identify the condition in which a measured length is a
proper length.
37.13 Identify that if a length is a proper length as measured
in one frame, the length is less (contracted) as measured in
another frame that is in relative motion parallel to the length.
37.14 Apply the relationship between contracted length L, proper
length L0, and the relative speed v between two frames.
Learning Objectives
●The length L0 of an object measured by an observer in an
inertial reference frame in which the object is at rest is called
its proper length. Observers in frames moving relative to that
frame and parallel to that length will always measure a shorter
length, an effect known as length contraction.
●If the relative speed between frames is v, the contracted
length L and the proper length L0 are related by
where b ! v/c is the speed parameter and 
is
the Lorentz factor.
