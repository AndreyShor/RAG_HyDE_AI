Simple harmonic motion is the projection of uniform circular motion on a diame-
ter of the circle in which the circular motion occurs.
Figure 15-15a gives an example. It shows a reference particle P. moving in
uniform circular motion with (constant) angular speed v in a reference circle. The
radius xm of the circle is the magnitude of the particle’s position vector. At any
time t, the angular position of the particle is vt # f, where f is its angular posi-
tion at t ! 0.
Position. The projection of particle P. onto the x axis is a point P, which we
take to be a second particle. The projection of the position vector of particle P.
onto the x axis gives the location x(t) of P. (Can you see the x component in the
triangle in Fig. 15-5a?) Thus, we find
x(t) ! xm cos(vt # f),
(15-36)
which is precisely Eq. 15-3. Our conclusion is correct. If reference particle P.
moves in uniform circular motion, its projection particle P moves in simple
harmonic motion along a diameter of the circle.
Velocity. Figure 15-15b shows the velocity 
of the reference particle. From
Eq. 10-18 (v
r), the magnitude of the velocity vector is xm; its projection on
the x axis is
v(t) ! %vxm sin(vt # f),
(15-37)
which is exactly Eq. 15-6.The minus sign appears because the velocity component
of P in Fig. 15-15b is directed to the left, in the negative direction of x. (The minus
sign is consistent with the derivative of Eq. 15-36 with respect to time.)
Acceleration. Figure 15-15c shows the radial acceleration 
of the reference
particle. From Eq. 10-23 (ar
r), the magnitude of the radial acceleration vec-
tor is 
2xm; its projection on the x axis is
a(t) ! %v2xm cos(vt # f),
(15-38)
which is exactly Eq. 15-7.Thus, whether we look at the displacement, the velocity,
or the acceleration, the projection of uniform circular motion is indeed simple
harmonic motion.
