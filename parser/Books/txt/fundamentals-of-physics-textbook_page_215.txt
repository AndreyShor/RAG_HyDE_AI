This is a plot of the potential
energy U versus position x.
Force is equal to the negative of
the slope of the U(x) plot.

U(x)
The flat line shows a given value of
the total mechanical energy Emec.
The difference between the total energy
and the potential energy is the
kinetic energy K.

At this position, K is greatest and
the particle is moving the fastest.
At this position, K is zero (a turning point).
The particle cannot go farther to the left.
For either of these three choices for Emec,
the particle is trapped (cannot escape
left or right).

Figure 8-9 (a) A plot of U(x), the potential energy function of a system containing a particle confined to move along an x axis. There is no
friction, so mechanical energy is conserved. (b) A plot of the force F(x) acting on the particle, derived from the potential energy plot by
taking its slope at various points. (c)–(e) How to determine the kinetic energy. ( f) The U(x) plot of (a) with three possible values of Emec
shown. In WileyPLUS, this figure is available as an animation with voiceover.
