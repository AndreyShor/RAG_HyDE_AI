SOLUTION  OF  GRAVITATION         101 
clocks  and  freely-moving  material  points  continues  to 
take  place  accordingrto  the  same  laws,  even  in  the  case 
when  the  prevailing  gravitational  field  is  not  derivable 
from  the  Galileian  special  case,  simply  by  means  of  a 
transformation  of  co-ordinates. 
The  next  step  is  to  investigate  the  space-time 
behaviour  of  the  gravitational  field  G,  which  was  derived 
from  the  Galileian  special  case  simply  by  transformation 
of  the  co-ordinates.  This  behaviour  is  formulated 
in  a  law,  which  is  always  valid,  no  matter  how  the 
reference-body  (mollusk)  used  in  the  description  may 
be  chosen. 
This  law  is  not  yet  the  general  law  of  the  gravitational 
field,  since  the  gravitational  field  under  consideration  is 
of  a  special  kind.  In  order  to  find  out  the  general 
law-of-field  of  gravitation  we  still  require  to  obtain  a 
generalisation  of  the  law  as  found  above.  This  can  be 
obtained  without  caprice,  however,  by  taking  into 
consideration  the  following  demands : 
(a)  The  required  generalisation  must  likewise  satisfy 
the  general  postulate  of  relativity. 
(6)  If  there  is  any  matter  in  the  domain  under  con 
sideration,  only  its  inertia!  mass,  and  thus 
according  to  Section  XV  only  its  energy  is  of 
importance  for  its  effect  in  exciting  a  field. 
(c)  Gravitational  field  and  matter  together  must 
satisfy  the  law  of  the  conservation  of  energy 
(and  of  impulse). 
Finally,  the  general  principle  of  relativity  permits 
us  to  determine  the  influence  of  the  gravitational  field 
on  the  course  of  all  those  processes  which  take  place 
according  to  known  laws  when  a  gravitational  field  is
