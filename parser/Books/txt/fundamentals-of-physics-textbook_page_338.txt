Conservation of Angular Momentum
So far we have discussed two powerful conservation laws, the conservation of 
energy and the conservation of linear momentum. Now we meet a third law of
this type, involving the conservation of angular momentum. We start from 
We have dropped the subscript z, but you must remember that the angular
momentum defined by Eq. 11-31 is the angular momentum about the rotation
axis.Also, I in that equation is the rotational inertia about that same axis.
Table 11-1, which supplements Table 10-3, extends our list of corresponding
linear and angular relations.

CHAPTER 11
ROLLING, TORQUE, AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM
Checkpoint 6
In the figure, a disk, a
hoop, and a solid sphere
are made to spin about
fixed central axes (like a
top) by means of strings
wrapped around them, with the strings producing the same constant tangential force
on all three objects.The three objects have the same mass and radius, and they are
initially stationary. Rank the objects according to (a) their angular momentum about
their central axes and (b) their angular speed, greatest first, when the strings have
been pulled for a certain time t.

11-8 CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
11.25 When no external net torque acts on a system along a specified axis, apply the conservation of angular momentum to 
relate the initial angular momentum value along that axis to the value at a later instant.
●The angular momentum 
of a system remains constant if the net external torque acting on the system is zero:
(isolated system)
or
(isolated system).
This is the law of conservation of angular momentum.
