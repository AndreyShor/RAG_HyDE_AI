24    SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
the  railway  line  (co-ordinate  system),  and  that  they 
are  set  in  such  a  manner  that  the  positions  of  their 
pointers  are  simultaneously  (in  the  above  sense)  the 
same.  Under  these  conditions  we  understand  by  the 
"  time  "  of  an  event  the  reading  (position  of  the  hands) 
of  that  one  of  these  clocks  which  is  in  the  immediate 
vicinity  (in  space)  of  the  event.  In  this  manner  a 
time-value  is  associated  with  every  event  which  is 
essentially  capable  of  observation. 
This  stipulation  contains  a  further  physical  hypothesis, 
the  validity  of  which  will  hardly  be  doubted  without 
empirical  e  vddence  to  the  contrary.  It  has  been  assumed 
that  all  these  clocks  go  at  the  same  vote  if  they  are  of 
identical  construction.  Stated  more  exactly :  When 
two  clocks  arranged  at  rest  in  different  places  of  a 
reference-body  are  set  in  such  a  manner  that  a  particular 
position  of  the  pointers  of  the  one  clock  is  simultaneous 
(in  the  above  sense)  with  the  same  position  of  the 
pointers  of  the  other  clock,  then  identical  "  settings  " 
are  always  simultaneous  (in  the  sense  of  the  above 
definition).
