24-6 CALCULATING THE FIELD FROM THE POTENTIAL
Calculating the Field from the Potential
In Module 24-2, you saw how to find the potential at a point f if you know
the electric field along a path from a reference point to point f. In this module,
we propose to go the other way—that is, to find the electric field when we know
the potential. As Fig. 24-5 shows, solving this problem graphically is easy: If we
know the potential V at all points near an assembly of charges, we can draw in
a family of equipotential surfaces.The electric field lines, sketched perpendicular
to those surfaces, reveal the variation of 
.What we are seeking here is the math-
ematical equivalent of this graphical procedure.
Figure 24-17 shows cross sections of a family of closely spaced equipo-
tential surfaces, the potential difference between each pair of adjacent surfaces
being dV.As the figure suggests, the field 
at any point P is perpendicular to the
equipotential surface through P.
Suppose that a positive test charge q0 moves through a displacement 
from one equipotential surface to the adjacent surface. From Eq. 24-6, we see that
the work the electric field does on the test charge during the move is 'q0 dV.
From Eq. 24-16 and Fig. 24-17, we see that the work done by the electric field may
also be written as the scalar product 
or q0E(cos u) ds. Equating these
two expressions for the work yields
'q0 dV $ q0E(cos u) ds,
(24-38)
or
(24-39)
Since E cos u is the component of 
in the direction of 
Eq. 24-39 becomes
(24-40)
We have added a subscript to E and switched to the partial derivative symbols
to emphasize that Eq. 24-40 involves only the variation of V along a specified axis
(here called the s axis) and only the component of 
along that axis. In words,
Eq. 24-40 (which is essentially the reverse operation of Eq. 24-18) states:

face to another. (The separation between

24-6 CALCULATING THE FIELD FROM THE POTENTIAL
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
24.23 Given an electric potential as a function of position
along an axis, find the electric field along that axis.
24.24 Given a graph of electric potential versus position
along an axis, determine the electric field along the axis.
24.25 For a uniform electric field, relate the field magnitude E
and the separation x and potential difference V
between adjacent equipotential lines.
24.26 Relate the direction of the electric field and 
the directions in which the potential decreases and 
increases.
