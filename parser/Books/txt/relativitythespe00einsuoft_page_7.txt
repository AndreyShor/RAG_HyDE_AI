PREFACE 
THE  present  book  is  intended,  as  far  as  possible, 
to  give  an  exact  insight  into  the  theory  of  Re 
lativity  to  those  readers  who,  from  a  general 
scientific  and  philosophical  point  of  view,  are  interested 
in  the  theory,  but  who  are  not  conversant  with  the 
mathematical  apparatus l  of  theoretical  physics.  The 
work  presumes  a  standard  of  education  corresponding 
to  that  of  a  university  matriculation  examination, 
and,  despite  the  shortness  of  the  book,  a  fair  amount 
of  patience  and  force  of  will  on  the  part  of  the  reader. 
The  author  has  spared  himself  no  pains  in  his  endeavour 
1  The  mathematical  fundaments  of  the  special  theory  of 
relativity  are  to  be  found  in  the  original  papers  of  H.  A.  Lorentz, 
A.  Einstein,  H.  Minkowski,  published  under  the  title  Das 
Relativitdtsprinzip  (The  Principle  of  Relativity)  in  B.  G. 
Teubner's  collection  of  monographs  Fortschritte  der  mathe- 
matischen  Wissenschajten  (Advances  in  the  Mathematical 
Sciences),  also  in  M.  Laue's  exhaustive  book  Das  Relativitdts 
prinzip — published  by  Friedr.  Vieweg  &  Son,  Braunschweig. 
The  general  theory  of  relativity,  together  with  the  necessary 
parts  of  the  theory  of  invariants,  is  dealt  with  in  the  author's 
book  Die  Grundlagen  der  allgcmeinen  Relativitdtstheorie  (The 
Foundations  of  the  General  Theory  of  Relativity) — Joh.  Ambr. 
Barth,  1916  ;  this  book  assumes  some  familiarity  with  the  special 
theory  of  relativity.
