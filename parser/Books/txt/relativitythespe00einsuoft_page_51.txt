THE  LORENTZ  TRANSFORMATION     33

This  system  of  equations  is  known  as  the  "  Lorentz 
transformation." l 
If  in  place  of  the  law  of  transmission  of  light  we  had 
taken  as  our  basis  the  tacit  assumptions  of  the  older 
mechanics  as  to  the  absolute  character  of  times  and 
lengths,  then  instead  of  the  above  we  should  have 
obtained  the  following  equations  : 
x'=x— vt 
y'—y 
z'=z 
t'=t. 
This  system  of  equations  is  often  termed  the  "  Galilei 
transformation."  The  Galilei  transformation  can  be 
obtained  from  the  Lorentz  transformation  by  sub 
stituting  an  infinitely  large  value  for  the  velocity  of 
light  c  in  the  latter  transformation. 
Aided  by  the  following  illustration,  we  can  readily 
see  that,  in  accordance  with  the  Lorentz  transforma 
tion,  the  law  of  the  transmission  of  light  in  vacua 
is  satisfied  both  for  the  reference-body  K  and  for  the 
reference-body  K'.  A  light-signal  is  sent  along  the 
positive  #-axis,  and  this  light-stimulus  advances  in 
accordance  with  the  equation 
x=ct,

in  Appendix  I.
