A beam of electrons whose
kinetic energy is K emerges from a
thin-foil “window” at the end of an
accelerator tube.A metal plate at dis-
tance d from this window is perpendi-
cular to the direction of the emerging
beam (Fig. 28-53). (a) Show that we
can prevent the beam from hitting
the plate if we apply a uniform mag-
netic field  such that

Bainbridge’s mass spectrometer,
shown in Fig. 28-54, separates ions
having the same velocity. The ions, af-
ter entering through slits, S1 and S2,
pass through a velocity selector com-
posed of an electric field produced by
the charged plates P and P(, and a
magnetic field 
perpendicular to the
electric field and the ion path. The
ions 
that 
then 
pass 
undeviated
through the crossed 
and 
fields
enter into a region where a second
magnetic field 
( exists, where they are made to follow circular
paths. A photographic plate (or a modern detector) registers their
arrival. Show that, for the ions, q/m ! E/rBB(, where r is the radius
of the circular orbit.

In a Hall-effect experiment, a current of 3.0 A sent length-
