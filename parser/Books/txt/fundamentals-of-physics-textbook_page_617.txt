in both its vapor and its liquid form. In an automobile engine the working sub-
stance is a gasoline–air mixture. If an engine is to do work on a sustained basis,
the working substance must operate in a cycle; that is, the working substance
must pass through a closed series of thermodynamic processes, called strokes,
returning again and again to each state in its cycle. Let us see what the laws of
thermodynamics can tell us about the operation of engines.
A Carnot Engine
We have seen that we can learn much about real gases by analyzing an ideal gas,
which obeys the simple law pV # nRT. Although an ideal gas does not exist, any
real gas approaches ideal behavior if its density is low enough. Similarly, we can
study real engines by analyzing the behavior of an ideal engine.

20-2 ENTROPY IN THE REAL WORLD: ENGINES
In an ideal engine, all processes are reversible and no wasteful energy transfers
occur due to, say, friction and turbulence.
We shall focus on a particular ideal engine called a Carnot engine after the
French scientist and engineer N. L. Sadi Carnot (pronounced “car-no”), who first
proposed the engine’s concept in 1824. This ideal engine turns out to be the best
(in principle) at using energy as heat to do useful work. Surprisingly, Carnot was
able to analyze the performance of this engine before the first law of thermo-
dynamics and the concept of entropy had been discovered.
Figure 20-8 shows schematically the operation of a Carnot engine. During
each cycle of the engine, the working substance absorbs energy +QH+ as heat from
a thermal reservoir at constant temperature TH and discharges energy +QL+ as
heat to a second thermal reservoir at a constant lower temperature TL.
Figure 20-9 shows a p-V plot of the Carnot cycle—the cycle followed by
the working substance. As indicated by the arrows, the cycle is traversed in the
clockwise direction. Imagine the working substance to be a gas, confined to an
insulating cylinder with a weighted, movable piston. The cylinder may be placed
at will on either of the two thermal reservoirs, as in Fig. 20-6, or on an insulating
slab. Figure 20-9a shows that, if we place the cylinder in contact with the high-
temperature reservoir at temperature TH, heat +QH+ is transferred to the working
substance from this reservoir as the gas undergoes an isothermal expansion from
volume Va to volume Vb. Similarly, with the working substance in contact with
the low-temperature reservoir at temperature TL, heat +QL+ is transferred from
Figure 20-8 The elements of a Carnot
engine. The two black arrowheads on the
central loop suggest the working substance
operating in a cycle, as if on a p-V plot.
Energy +QH+ is transferred as heat from
the high-temperature reservoir at temper-
ature TH to the working substance. Energy
+QL+ is transferred as heat from the work-
ing substance to the low-temperature
reservoir at temperature TL. Work W is
done by the engine (actually by the work-
ing substance) on something in the envi-
ronment.
