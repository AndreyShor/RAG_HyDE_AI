BASIC PHYSICS
Introduction
In this chapter, we shall examine the most fundamental ideas
that we have about physics—the nature of things as we see them
at the present time. We shall not discuss the history of how we know
that all these ideas are true; you will learn these details in due time.
The things with which we concern ourselves in science appear
in myriad forms, and with a multitude of attributes. For example,
if we stand on the shore and look at the sea, we see the water, the
waves breaking, the foam, the sloshing motion of the water, the
sound, the air, the winds and the clouds, the sun and the blue sky,
and light; there is sand and there are rocks of various hardness and
permanence, color and texture. There are animals and seaweed,
hunger and disease, and the observer on the beach; there may be
even happiness and thought. Any other spot in nature has a similar
variety of things and inﬂuences. It is always as complicated as that,
no matter where it is. Curiosity demands that we ask questions,
that we try to put things together and try to understand this mul-
titude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively
small number of elemental things and forces acting in an inﬁnite
variety of combinations.
For example: Is the sand other than the rocks? That is, is the sand
perhaps nothing but a great number of very tiny stones? Is the moon
a great rock? If we understood rocks, would we also understand the
