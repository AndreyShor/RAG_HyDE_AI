the region where they meet and make belts of mountains which
are in unhappy stressed conditions, and so produce volcanoes and
earthquakes.
What about the inside of the earth? A great deal is known about
the speed of earthquake waves through the earth and the density
of distribution of the earth. However, physicists have been unable
to get a good theory as to how dense a substance should be at the
pressures that would be expected at the center of the earth. In
other words, we cannot ﬁgure out the properties of matter very
well in these circumstances. We do much less well with the earth
than we do with the conditions of matter in the stars. The math-
ematics involved seems a little too difficult, so far, but perhaps it
will not be too long before someone realizes that it is an important
problem, and really works it out. The other aspect, of course, is
that even if we did know the density, we cannot ﬁgure out the cir-
culating currents. Nor can we really work out the properties of
rocks at high pressure. We cannot tell how fast the rocks should
“give”; that must all be worked out by experiment.
Psychology
Next, we consider the science of psychology. Incidentally, psycho-
analysis is not a science: it is at best a medical process, and perhaps
even more like witch-doctoring. It has a theory as to what causes
disease—lots of different “spirits,” etc. The witch doctor has a
theory that a disease like malaria is caused by a spirit which comes
into the air; it is not cured by shaking a snake over it, but quinine
does help malaria. So, if you are sick, I would advise that you go
to the witch doctor because he is the man in the tribe who knows
the most about the disease; on the other hand, his knowledge is
not science. Psychoanalysis has not been checked carefully by ex-
periment, and there is no way to ﬁnd a list of the number of cases
in which it works, the number of cases in which it does not work,
etc.
