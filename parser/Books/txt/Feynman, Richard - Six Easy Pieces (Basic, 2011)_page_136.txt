watch the stars go around each other, why can we not take a ball of
lead and a marble and watch the marble go toward the ball of lead?
The difficulty of this experiment when done in such a simple man-
ner is the very weakness or delicacy of the force. It must be done
with extreme care, which means covering the apparatus to keep the
air out, making sure it is not electrically charged, and so on; then
the force can be measured. It was ﬁrst measured by Cavendish with
an apparatus which is schematically indicated in Fig. 5-13. This
ﬁrst demonstrated the direct force between two large, ﬁxed balls of
lead and two smaller balls of lead on the ends of an arm supported
by a very ﬁne ﬁber, called a torsion ﬁber. By measuring how much
the ﬁber gets twisted, one can measure the strength of the force,
verify that it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance,
and determine how strong it is. Thus, one may accurately deter-
mine the coefficient G in the formula
