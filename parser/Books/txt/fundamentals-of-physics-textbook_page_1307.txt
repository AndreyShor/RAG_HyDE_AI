We organize the nuclides on a nuclidic chart like that in Fig.
42-5, in which a nuclide is represented by plotting its proton num-
ber against its neutron number. The stable nuclides in this figure
are represented by the green, the radionuclides by the beige. As
you can see, the radionuclides tend to lie on either side of—and at
the upper end of—a well-defined band of stable nuclides. Note too
that light stable nuclides tend to lie close to the line N ! Z, which
means that they have about the same numbers of neutrons and
protons. Heavier nuclides, however, tend to have many more neu-
trons than protons.As an example, we saw that 197Au has 118 neu-
trons and only 79 protons, a neutron excess of 39.
Nuclidic charts are available as wall charts, in which each small
box on the chart is filled with data about the nuclide it represents.
Figure 42-6 shows a section of such a chart, centered on 197Au.
Relative abundances (usually, as found on Earth) are shown for
stable nuclides, and half-lives (a measure of decay rate) are shown
for radionuclides. The sloping line points out a line of isobars—
nuclides of the same mass number, A ! 198 in this case.
In recent years, nuclides with atomic numbers as high as
Z ! 118 (A ! 294) have been found in laboratory experiments
(no elements with Z greater than 92 occur naturally). Although
large nuclides generally should be highly unstable and last only a
very brief time, certain supermassive nuclides are relatively stable,
with fairly long lifetimes. These stable supermassive nuclides and
other predicted ones form an island of stability at high values of Z
and N on a nuclidic chart like Fig. 42-5.

42-2 SOME NUCLEAR PROPERTIES
Figure 42-5 A plot of the known
nuclides.The green shading identifies
the band of stable nuclides,the beige
shading the radionuclides.Low-mass,
stable nuclides have essentially equal
numbers of neutrons and protons,but
more massive nuclides have an increas-
ing excess of neutrons.The figure shows
that there are no stable nuclides with 
Z . 83 (bismuth).

Figure 42-6 An enlarged and detailed section of the nuclidic
chart of Fig. 42-5, centered on 197Au. Green squares represent
stable nuclides, for which relative isotopic abundances are
given. Beige squares represent radionuclides, for which half-
lives are given. Isobaric lines of constant mass number A

Based on Fig.42-5,which of the following nuclides do you conclude are
not likely to be detected: 52Fe (Z ! 26), 90As (Z ! 33), 158Nd (Z ! 60),
175Lu (Z ! 71), 208Pb (Z ! 82)?
