62     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
old  friend  the  railway  carriage,  which  is  travelling  at  a 
uniform  rate.  As  long  as  it  is  moving  uniformly,  the 
occupant  of  the  carriage  is  not  sensible  of  its  motion, 
and  it  is  for  this  reason  that  he  can  without  reluctance 
interpret  the  facts  of  the  case  as  indicating  that  the 
carriage  is  at  restobut  the  embankment  in  motion. 
Moreover,  according  to  the  special  principle  of  relativity, 
this  interpretation  is  quite  justified  also  from  a  physical 
point  of  view. 
If  the  nlotion  of  the  carriage  is  now  changed  into  a 
non-uniform;  motion,  as  for  instance  by  a  powerful 
application  of  the  brakes,  then  the  occupant  of  the 
carriage  experiences  a  correspondingly  powerful  jerk 
forwards.  The  retarded  motion  is  manifested  in  the 
mechanical  behaviour  of  bodies  relative  to  the  person 
in  the  railway  carriage.  The  mechanical  behaviour  is 
different  from  that  of  the  case  previously  considered, 
and  for  this  reason  it  would  appear  to  be  impossible 
that  the  same  mechanical  laws  hold  relatively  to  the  non- 
uniformly  moving  carriage,  as  hold  with  reference  to  the 
carriage  when  at  rest  or  in  uniform  motion.  At  all 
events  it  is  clear  that  the  Galileian  law  does  not  hold 
with  respect  to  the  non-uniformly  moving  carriage. 
Because  of  this,  we  feel  compelled  at  the  present  juncture 
to  grant  a  kind  of  absolute  physical  reality  to  non- 
uniform  motion,  in  opposmpn  to  the  general  principle 
of  relativity.  But  in  what  follows  we  shall  soon  see 
that  this  conclusion  cannot  be  maintained.
