114    CONSIDERATIONS  ON  THE  UNIVERSE 
magnitude  of  our  sun.  We  might  imagine  that,  as 
regards  geometry,  our  universe  behaves  analogously 
to  a  surface  which  is  irregularly  curved  in  its  individual 
parts,  but  which  nowhere  departs  appreciably  from  a 
plane  :  something  like  the  rippled  surface  of  a  lake. 
Such  a  universe  might  fittingly  be  called  a  quasi- 
Euclidean  universe.  As  regards  its  space  it  would  be 
infinite.  But  calculation  shows  that  in  a  quasi- 
Euclidean  universe  the  average  density  of  matter 
would  necessarily  be  nil.  Thus  such  a  universe  could 
not  be  inhabited  by  matter  everywhere  ;  it  would 
present  to  us  that  unsatisfactory  picture  which  we 
portrayed  in  Section  XXX. 
If  we  are  to  have  in  the  universe  an  average  density 
of  matter  which  differs  from  zero,  however  small  may 
be  that  difference,  then  the  universe  cannot  be  quasi- 
Euclidean.  On  the  contrary,  the  results  of  calculation 
indicate  that  if  matter  be  distributed  uniformly,  the 
universe  would  necessarily  be  spherical  (or  elliptical). 
Since  in  reality  the  detailed  distribution  of  matter  is 
not  uniform,  the  real  universe  will  deviate  in  individual 
parts  from  the  spherical,  i.e.  the  universe  will  be  quasi- 
spherical.  But  it  will  be  necessarily  finite.  In  fact,  the 
theory  supplies  us  with  a  simple  connection  x  between 
the  space-expanse  of  the  universe  and  the  average 
density  of  matter  in  it.
