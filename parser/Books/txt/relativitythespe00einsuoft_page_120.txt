102    GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
absent,  i.e.  which  have  already  been  fitted  into  the 
frame  of  the  special  theory  of  relativity.  In  this  con 
nection  we  proceed  in  principle  according  to  the  method 
which  has  already  been  explained  for  measuring-rods, 
clocks  and  freely-moving  material  points. 
The  theory  of  gravitation  derived  in  this  way  from 
the  general  postulate  of  relativity  excels  not  only  in 
its  beauty ;  nor  in  removing  the  defect  attaching  to 
classical  mechanics  which  was  brought  to  light  in  Section 
XXI ;  nor  in  interpreting  the  empirical  law  of  the  equality 
of  inertial  and  gravitational  mass  ;  but  it  has  also 
already  explained  a  result  of  observation  in  astronomy, 
against  which  classical  mechanics  is  powerless. 
If  we  confine  the  application  of  the  theory  to  the 
case  where  the  gravitational  fields  can  be  regarded  as 
being  weak,  and  in  which  all  masses  move  with  respect 
to  the  co-ordinate  system  with  velocities  which  are 
small  compared  with  the  velocity  of  light,  we  then  obtain 
as  a  first  approximation  the  Newtonian  theory.  Thus 
the  latter  theory  is  obtained  here  without  any  particular 
assumption,  whereas  Newton  had  to  introduce  the 
hypothesis  that  the  force  of  attraction  between  mutually 
attracting  material  points  is  inversely  proportional  to 
the  square  of  the  distance  between  them.  If  we  in 
crease  the  accuracy  of  the  calculation,  deviations  from 
the  theory  of  Newton  make  their  appearance,  practi 
cally  all  of  which  must  nevertheless  escape  the  test  of 
observation  owing  to  their  smallness. 
We  must  draw  attention  here  to  one  of  these  devia 
tions.  According  to  Newton's  theory,  a  planet  moves 
round  the  sun  in  an  ellipse,  which  would  permanently 
maintain  its  position  with  respect  to  the  fixed  stars, 
if  we  could  disregard  the  motion  of  the  fixed  stars
