Atomic clocks are so consistent that, in principle, two cesium clocks would have to
run for 6000 years before their readings would differ by more than 1 s. Even such
accuracy pales in comparison with that of clocks currently being developed; their
precision may be 1 part in 1018—that is, 1 s in 1 ' 1018 s (which is about 3 ' 1010 y).

CHAPTER 1
MEASUREMENT
To meet the need for a better time standard, atomic clocks have
been developed. An atomic clock at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, Colorado, is the stan-
dard for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in the United States. Its
time signals are available by shortwave radio (stations WWV and
WWVH) and by telephone (303-499-7111). Time signals (and related
information) are also available from the United States Naval
Observatory at website http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/time.html. (To set a
clock extremely accurately at your particular location, you would have
to account for the travel time required for these signals to reach you.)
Figure 1-2 shows variations in the length of one day on Earth over
a 4-year period, as determined by comparison with a cesium
(atomic) clock. Because the variation displayed by Fig. 1-2 is sea-
sonal and repetitious, we suspect the rotating Earth when there is a
difference between Earth and atom as timekeepers. The variation is
due to tidal effects caused by the Moon and to large-scale winds.
The 13th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1967 adopted
a standard second based on the cesium clock:
One second is the time taken by 9 192 631 770 oscillations of the light (of a specified
wavelength) emitted by a cesium-133 atom.

day over a 4-year period. Note that the
entire vertical scale amounts to only

1-3 MASS
Learning Objectives
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
1.07 Change units for mass by using chain-link 
conversions.
1.08 Relate density to mass and volume when the mass is
uniformly distributed. 
Key Ideas
●The kilogram is defined in terms of a platinum–iridium
standard mass kept near Paris. For measurements on an
atomic scale, the atomic mass unit, defined in terms of 
the atom carbon-12, is usually used. 
●The density of a material is the mass per unit volume:
