THE  SYSTEM  OF  CO-ORDINATES 
ON  
the  basis  of  the  physical  interpretation  of  dis 
tance  which  has  been  indicated,  we  are  also 
in  a  position  to  establish  the  distance  between 
two  points  on  a  rigid  body  by  means  of  measurements. 
For  this  purpose  we  require  a  "  distance  "  (rod  5) 
which  is  to  be  used  once  and  for  all,  and  which  we 
employ  as  a  standard  measure.  If,  now,  A  and  B  are 
two  points  on  a  rigid  body,  we  can  construct  the 
line  joining  them  according  to  the  rules  of  geometry  ; 
then,  starting  from  A,  we  can  mark  off  the  distance 
S  time  after  time  until  we  reach  B.  The  number  of 
these  operations  required  is  the  numerical  measure 
of  the  distance  AB.  This  is  the  basis  of  all  measure 
ment  of  length.1 
Every  description  of  the  scene  of  an  event  or  of  the 
position  of  an  object  in  space  is  based  on  the  specifica 
tion  of  the  point  on  a  rigid  body  (body  of  reference) 
with  which  that  event  or  object  coincides.  This  applies 
not  only  to  scientific  description,  but  also  to  everyday 
life.  If  I  analyse  the  place  specification  "  Trafalgar 
1  Here  we  have  assumed  that  there  is  nothing  left  over,  i.e. 
that  the  measurement  gives  a  whole  number.  This  difficulty 
is  got  over  by  the  use  of  divided  measuring-rods,  the  introduction 
of  which  does  not  demand  any  fundamentally  new  method.
