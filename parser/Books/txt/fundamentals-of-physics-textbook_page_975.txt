Maxwell’s Equations
Equation 32-5 is the last of the four fundamental equations of electromagnetism,
called Maxwell’s equations and displayed in Table 32-1. These four equations
the changing electric flux with a fictitious displacement cur-
rent id. Then integral 
is given by Eq. 32-11, but
because there is no real current i between the capacitor
plates, the equation reduces to
(32-18)
Calculations: Because we want to evaluate 
at
radius r
R/5 (within the capacitor), the integration loop en-
circles only a portion id,enc of the total displacement current id.
Let’s assume that id is uniformly spread over the full plate
area. Then the portion of the displacement current encircled
by the loop is proportional to the area encircled by the loop:
This gives us
Substituting this into Eq. 32-18, we obtain
(32-19)
Now substituting id ! i (from Eq. 32-15) and r ! R/5 into
Eq. 32-19 leads to

(b) In terms of the maximum induced magnetic field, what is
the magnitude of the magnetic field induced at r ! R/5,
inside the capacitor?
KEY IDEA
Because the capacitor has parallel circular plates, we can
treat the space between the plates as an imaginary wire of
radius R carrying the imaginary current id. Then we can use
Eq. 32-16 to find the induced magnetic field magnitude B at
any point inside the capacitor.
Calculations: At r ! R/5, Eq. 32-16 yields
(32-20)
From Eq. 32-16, the maximum field magnitude Bmax within
the capacitor occurs at r ! R. It is
(32-21)
Dividing Eq. 32-20 by Eq. 32-21 and rearranging the result,
we find that the field magnitude at r ! R/5 is
(Answer)
We should be able to obtain this result with a little rea-
soning and less work. Equation 32-16 tells us that inside the
capacitor, B increases linearly with r.Therefore, a point the
distance out to the full radius R of the plates, where Bmax
occurs, should have a field B that is
