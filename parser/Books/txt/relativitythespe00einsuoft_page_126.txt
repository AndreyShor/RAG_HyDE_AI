THE  POSSIBILITY  OF  A  "FINITE"  AND  YET 
"UNBOUNDED"  UNIVERSE 
BUT  
speculations  on  the  structure  of  the  universe 
also    move    in    quite    another    direction.     The 
development  of  non-Euclidean  geometry  led  to 
the  recognition  of  the  fact,  that  we  can  cast  doubt  on  the 
infiniteness  of  our  space  without  coming  into  conflict 
with  the  laws  of  thought  or  with  experience  (Riemann, 
Helmholtz) .     These  questions  have  already  been  treated 
in  detail  and  with   unsurpassable  lucidity  by  Helm 
holtz  and  Poincare,  whereas  I  can  only  touch  on  them 
briefly  here. 
In  the  first  place,  we  imagine  an  existence  in  two- 
dimensional  space.  Flat  beings  with  flat  implements, 
and  in  particular  flat  rigid  measuring-rods,  are  free  to 
move  in  a  plane.  For  them  nothing  exists  outside  of 
this  plane:  that  which  they  observe  to  happen  to 
themselves  and  to  their  flat  "  things  "  is  the  all-inclusive 
reality  of  their  plane.  In  particular,  the  constructions 
of  plane  Euclidean  geometry  can  be  carried  out  by 
means  of  the  rods,  e.g.  the  lattice  construction,  considered 
in  Section  XXIV.  In  contrast  to  ours,  the  universe  of 
these  beings  is  two-dimensional ;  but,  like  ours,  it  extends 
to  infinity.  In  their  universe  there  is  room  for  an 
infinite  number  of  identical  squares  made  up  of  rods
