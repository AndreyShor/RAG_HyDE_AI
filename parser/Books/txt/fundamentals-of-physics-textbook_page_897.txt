dA to be the area of a vertical strip of height H and width dx
(as shown in Fig. 30-7). Then dA ! H dx, and the flux
through the loop is
Treating t as a constant for this integration and inserting the
integration limits x ! 0 and x ! 3.0 m, we obtain
where we have substituted H ! 2.0 m and 0B is in webers.
Now we can use Faraday’s law to find the magnitude of # at
any time t:
in which # is in volts.At t ! 0.10 s,
# ! (144 V/s)(0.10 s) % 14 V.
(Answer)
The flux of 
through the loop is into the page in
Fig. 30-7 and is increasing in magnitude because B is in-
creasing in magnitude with time. By Lenz’s law, the field Bind
of the induced current opposes this increase and so is di-
rected out of the page. The curled–straight right-hand rule
in Fig. 30-5a then tells us that the induced current is counter-
clockwise around the loop, and thus so is the induced emf #.

any time t. However, because B is not uniform over the
area enclosed by the loop, we cannot use Eq. 30-2 (0B !
BA) to find that expression; instead we must use Eq. 30-1
.
Calculations: In Fig. 30-7,
is perpendicular to the plane
of the loop (and hence parallel to the differential area 
vector 
); so the dot product in Eq. 30-1 gives B dA.
Because the magnetic field varies with the coordinate x but
not with the coordinate y, we can take the differential area

If the field varies with position,
we must integrate to get the

We start with a strip
so thin that we can
approximate the field as
being uniform within it.
30-2 INDUCTION AND ENERGY TRANSFERS
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
30.13 For a conducting loop pulled into or out of a magnetic
field, calculate the rate at which energy is transferred to
thermal energy.
30.14 Apply the relationship between an induced current and
the rate at which it produces thermal energy.
30.15 Describe eddy currents.
Learning Objectives
●The induction of a current by a changing flux means that energy is being transferred to that current. The energy can then be
transferred to other forms, such as thermal energy.
Key Idea
Induction and Energy Transfers
By Lenz’s law, whether you move the magnet toward or away from the loop in
Fig. 30-1, a magnetic force resists the motion, requiring your applied force to do
positive work. At the same time, thermal energy is produced in the material of
the loop because of the material’s electrical resistance to the current that is
induced by the motion.The energy you transfer to the closed loop & magnet sys-
tem via your applied force ends up in this thermal energy. (For now, we neglect
energy that is radiated away from the loop as electromagnetic waves during the
