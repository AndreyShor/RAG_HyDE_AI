Translational Kinetic Energy
We again consider a single molecule of an ideal gas as it moves around in the box
of Fig. 19-4, but we now assume that its speed changes when it collides with other
molecules. Its translational kinetic energy at any instant is 
. Its average
translational kinetic energy over the time that we watch it is
(19-23)
in which we make the assumption that the average speed of the molecule during
our observation is the same as the average speed of all the molecules at any given
time. (Provided the total energy of the gas is not changing and provided we
observe our molecule for long enough, this assumption is appropriate.) Substi-
tuting for vrms from Eq. 19-22 leads to
However, M/m, the molar mass divided by the mass of a molecule, is simply
Avogadro’s number.Thus,
Using Eq. 19-7 (k # R/NA), we can then write

19.19 For an ideal gas, relate the average kinetic energy of
the molecules to their rms speed.
19.20 Apply the relationship between the average kinetic
energy and the temperature of the gas.
19.21 Identify that a measurement of a gas temperature is
effectively a measurement of the average kinetic energy of
the gas molecules.

Checkpoint 2
A gas mixture consists of molecules of types 1,2,and 3,with molecular masses m1 4
m2 4 m3.Rank the three types according to (a) average kinetic energy and (b) rms
speed,greatest first.
At a given temperature T, all ideal gas molecules—no matter what their 
mass—have the same average translational kinetic energy—namely,
. When we
measure the temperature of a gas, we are also measuring the average translational
kinetic energy of its molecules.
