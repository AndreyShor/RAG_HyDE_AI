15-3 AN ANGULAR SIMPLE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR
An Angular Simple Harmonic Oscillator
Figure 15-9 shows an angular version of a simple harmonic oscillator; the element
of springiness or elasticity is associated with the twisting of a suspension wire
rather than the extension and compression of a spring as we previously had. The
device is called a torsion pendulum, with torsion referring to the twisting.
If we rotate the disk in Fig. 15-9 by some angular displacement u from its rest
position (where the reference line is at u ! 0) and release it, it will oscillate about
that position in angular simple harmonic motion. Rotating the disk through an
angle u in either direction introduces a restoring torque given by
t ! %ku.
(15-22)
Here k (Greek kappa) is a constant, called the torsion constant, that depends on
the length, diameter, and material of the suspension wire.
Comparison of Eq. 15-22 with Eq. 15-10 leads us to suspect that Eq. 15-22 is
the angular form of Hooke’s law, and that we can transform Eq. 15-13, which
gives the period of linear SHM, into an equation for the period of angular SHM:
We replace the spring constant k in Eq. 15-13 with its equivalent, the constant

15.24 For an angular simple harmonic oscillator, apply the re-
lationship between the torque t and the angular displace-
ment u (from equilibrium).
15.25 For an angular simple harmonic oscillator, apply the re-
lationship between the period T (or frequency f ), the rota-
tional inertia I, and the torsion constant k.
15.26 For an angular simple harmonic oscillator at any instant,
apply the relationship between the angular acceleration a, the
angular frequency v, and the angular displacement u.

(b) What is the block’s speed as it passes through the equi-
librium point?
Calculations: We want the speed at x ! 0, where the 
potential energy is 
and the mechanical energy
is entirely kinetic energy. So, we can write

v ! 12.6 m/s.

●A torsion pendulum consists of an object suspended on a wire. When the wire is twisted and then released, the object oscil-
lates in angular simple harmonic motion with a period given by
where I is the rotational inertia of the object about the axis of rotation and k is the torsion constant of the wire.

Key Idea
Figure 15-9 A torsion pendulum is an angular
version of a linear simple harmonic oscilla-
tor.The disk oscillates in a horizontal plane;
the reference line oscillates with angular
amplitude um.The twist in the suspension
wire stores potential energy as a spring does
and provides the restoring torque.
