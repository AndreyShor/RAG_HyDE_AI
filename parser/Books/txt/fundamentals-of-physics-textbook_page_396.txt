Satellite 1 is in a certain circular orbit around a planet, while satellite 2 is in a larger 
circular orbit.Which satellite has (a) the longer period and (b) the greater speed?
a triangle with base r'u and height r. Since the area of a triangle is one-half of the
base times the height, 'A %

3. THE LAW OF PERIODS: The square of the period of any planet is propor-
tional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit.
To see this, consider the circular orbit of Fig. 13-14, with radius r (the radius of
a circle is equivalent to the semimajor axis of an ellipse). Applying Newton’s
second law (F ! ma) to the orbiting planet in Fig. 13-14 yields
(13-33)
Here we have substituted from Eq. 13-1 for the force magnitude F and used
Eq. 10-23 to substitute v2r for the centripetal acceleration. If we now use Eq. 10-20
to replace v with 2p/T, where T is the period of the motion, we obtain Kepler’s
third law:
(law of periods).
(13-34)
The quantity in parentheses is a constant that depends only on the mass M of the
central body about which the planet orbits.
Equation 13-34 holds also for elliptical orbits, provided we replace r with
a, the semimajor axis of the ellipse.This law predicts that the ratio T 2/a3 has es-
sentially the same value for every planetary orbit around a given massive
body. Table 13-3 shows how well it holds for the orbits of the planets of the 
solar system.

in which v is the angular speed of the line connecting Sun and planet, as the line
rotates around the Sun.
Figure 13-13b shows the linear momentum 
of the planet,along with the radial

the magnitude of
the angular momentum 
of the planet about the Sun is given by the product of r
and 
the component of 
perpendicular to r.Here,for a planet of mass m,

between Eqs. 13-30 and 13-31 leads to
(13-32)
If dA/dt is constant, as Kepler said it is, then Eq. 13-32 means that L must also be
constant—angular momentum is conserved. Kepler’s second law is indeed
equivalent to the law of conservation of angular momentum.
