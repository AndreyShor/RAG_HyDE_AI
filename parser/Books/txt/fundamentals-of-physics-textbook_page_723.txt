24.19 Calculate the potential V at any given point due to an
electric dipole, in terms of the magnitude p of the dipole
moment or the product of the charge separation d and the
magnitude q of either charge.
24.20 For an electric dipole, identify the locations of positive
potential, negative potential, and zero potential.
24.21 Compare the decrease in potential with increasing dis-
tance for a single charged particle and an electric dipole.

Figure 24-13 (a) Point P is a distance r from
the midpoint O of a dipole. The line OP
makes an angle u with the dipole axis.
(b) If P is far from the dipole, the lines of
lengths r(") and r(') are approximately
parallel to the line of length r, and the
dashed black line is approximately per-
pendicular to the line of length r(').
Potential Due to an Electric Dipole
Now let us apply Eq. 24-27 to an electric dipole to find the potential at an 
arbitrary point P in Fig. 24-13a. At P, the positively charged particle (at distance
r(")) sets up potential V(") and the negatively charged particle (at distance r('))
sets up potential V(').Then the net potential at P is given by Eq. 24-27 as
(24-29)
Naturally occurring dipoles—such as those possessed by many mole-
cules—are quite small; so we are usually interested only in points that are rel-
atively far from the dipole, such that 
, where d is the distance between
the charges and r is the distance from the dipole’s midpoint to P. In that case,
we can approximate the two lines to P as being parallel and their length dif-
ference as being the leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse d (Fig. 24-13b).
Also, that difference is so small that the product of the lengths is approxi-
mately r 2.Thus,
r(') ' r(") % d cos u
and
r(')r(") % r 2.
If we substitute these quantities into Eq. 24-29, we can approximate V to be
where u is measured from the dipole axis as shown in Fig. 24-13a. We can now
write V as
(electric dipole),
(24-30)
in which p ($ qd) is the magnitude of the electric dipole moment 
defined in
Module 22-3. The vector 
is directed along the dipole axis, from the negative to
the positive charge. (Thus, u is measured from the direction of 
.) We use this
vector to report the orientation of an electric dipole.
