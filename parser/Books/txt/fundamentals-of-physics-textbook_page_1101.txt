both travel through a layer of plastic as
shown in Fig. 35-36, with L1 ! 4.00 mm,
L2 ! 3.50 mm, n1 ! 1.40, and n2 ! 1.60.

emerged from the layers? (b) If the
waves later arrive at some common
point with the same amplitude, is their
interference fully constructive, fully de-
structive, intermediate but closer to
fully constructive,or intermediate but closer to fully destructive?

equal to 100 times the wavelength of the light passing through the slits.

imum and an adjacent maximum? (b) What is the distance between
these maxima on a screen 50.0 cm from the slits?

frequency point sources S1 and S2, sep-
arated by distance d

ating in phase with l ! 0.50 m. A
detector moves in a large circular path
around the two sources in a plane con-
taining them. How many maxima does it detect?

In the two-slit experiment of Fig.35-10,let angle u be 20.0°,the slit

lies,or the maximum and minimum between which it lies.

Suppose that Young’s experiment is performed
with blue-green light of wavelength 500 nm. The slits are 1.20 mm
apart, and the viewing screen is 5.40 m from the slits. How far apart
are the bright fringes near the center of the interference pattern?

Monochromatic green light, of wavelength 550 nm, illumi-
nates two parallel narrow slits 7.70 mm apart. Calculate the angular
deviation (u in Fig. 35-10) of the third-order (m ! 3) bright fringe

In a double-slit experiment, the distance between slits is
5.0 mm and the slits are 1.0 m from the screen. Two interference
patterns can be seen on the screen: one due to light of wavelength
480 nm, and the other due to light of wavelength 600 nm. What is
the separation on the screen between the third-order (m ! 3)
bright fringes of the two interference patterns?

In Fig.35-37,two isotropic point sources S1 and S2 emit identical
light waves in phase at wavelength l.The sources lie at separation d on
an x axis,and a light detector is moved in a circle of large radius around
the midpoint between them. It detects 30 points of zero intensity, in-
cluding two on the x axis, one of them to the left of the sources and the
other to the right of the sources.What is the value of d/l?

In Fig. 35-38, sources A and B
emit long-range radio waves of wave-
length 400 m, with the phase of the
emission from A ahead of that from
source B by 90°. The distance rA from A

In Fig. 35-39, two isotropic point
sources S1 and S2 emit light in phase at
wavelength l and at the same ampli-
tude. The sources are separated by dis-
tance 2d ! 6.00l. They lie on an axis
that is parallel to an x axis, which runs
along a viewing screen at distance D !
20.0l.The origin lies on the perpendicu-
lar bisector between the sources. The
figure shows two rays reaching point P
on the screen, at position xP. (a) At what value of xP do the rays
have the minimum possible phase difference? (b) What multiple of
l gives that minimum phase difference? (c) At what value of xP do
the rays have the maximum possible phase difference? What mul-
tiple of l gives (d) that maximum phase difference and (e) the
phase difference when xP ! 6.00l? (f) When xP ! 6.00l, is the re-
sulting intensity at point P maximum, minimum, intermediate but
closer to maximum, or intermediate but closer to minimum?

separated by distance 2.70 mm along a
y axis and emit in phase at wavelength

light detector is located at point P at
coordinate xP on the x axis. What is
the greatest value of xP at which the

the fourth-order maximum, (b) should the slit separation be in-
creased or decreased and (c) what least change is needed?

ing screen is now occupied by what had been the seventh bright side

Figure 35-40
shows two isotropic
point sources of light
(S1 and S2) that emit in
phase at wavelength
400 nm and at the same
amplitude. A detection
point P is shown on an

axis that extends
through source S1. The
phase difference f be-
tween the light arriving at point P from the two sources is to be mea-
sured as P is moved along the x axis from x ! 0 out to x ! '1.The re-
sults out to xs ! 10 ( 10&7 m are given in Fig.35-41.On the way out to
