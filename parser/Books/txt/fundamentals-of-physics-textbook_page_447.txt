15-2 ENERGY IN SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION
Calculations: We know v and want f and xm. If we divide
Eq. 15-16 by Eq. 15-15, we eliminate one of those unknowns
and reduce the other to a single trig function:
Solving for tan f, we find
! %0.461.
This equation has two solutions:
f ! %25(
and
f ! 180( # (%25() ! 155(.
Normally only the first solution here is displayed by a calcu-
lator, but it may not be the physically possible solution. To
choose the proper solution, we test them both by using them
to compute values for the amplitude xm. From Eq. 15-15, we
find that if f ! %25(, then
We find similarly that if f ! 155(, then xm ! 0.094 m.
Because the amplitude of SHM must be a positive constant,
the correct phase constant and amplitude here are
f ! 155(
and
xm ! 0.094 m ! 9.4 cm.

Sample Problem 15.02
Finding SHM phase constant from displacement and velocity
At t ! 0, the displacement x(0) of the block in a linear oscil-
lator like that of Fig. 15-7 is %8.50 cm. (Read x(0) as “x at
time zero.”) The block’s velocity v(0) then is %0.920 m/s,
and its acceleration a(0) is #47.0 m/s2.
(a) What is the angular frequency v of this system?
KEY IDEA
With the block in SHM, Eqs. 15-3, 15-6, and 15-7 give its dis-
placement, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, and each
contains v.
Calculations: Let’s substitute t ! 0 into each to see
whether we can solve any one of them for v.We find
x(0) ! xm cos f,
(15-15)
v(0) ! %vxm sin f,
(15-16)
and
a(0) ! %v2xm cos f.
(15-17)
In Eq. 15-15, v has disappeared. In Eqs. 15-16 and 15-17, we
know values for the left sides, but we do not know xm and f.
However, if we divide Eq. 15-17 by Eq. 15-15, we neatly elim-
inate both xm and f and can then solve for v as
! 23.5 rad/s.
(Answer)
(b) What are the phase constant f and amplitude xm?
v ! A% a(0)
x(0) ! A% 47.0 m/s2
%0.0850 m

Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion
Let’s now examine the linear oscillator of Chapter 8, where we saw that the energy
transfers back and forth between kinetic energy and potential energy, while the sum
of the two—the mechanical energy E of the oscillator—remains constant. The
