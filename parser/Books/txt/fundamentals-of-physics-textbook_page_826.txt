CIRCUITS
73
Wires A and B, having equal lengths of 40.0 m and equal
diameters of 2.60 mm, are connected in series. A potential
difference of 60.0 V is applied between the ends of the composite
wire.The resistances are RA ! 0.127 0 and RB ! 0.729 0. For wire
A, what are (a) magnitude J of the current density and (b) poten-
tial difference V? (c) Of what type material is wire A made (see
Table 26-1)? For wire B, what are (d) J and (e) V? (f) Of what type
material is B made?

What are the (a) size and (b) direction (up or down) of cur-
rent i in Fig. 27-71, where all resistances are 4.0 0 and all batteries
are ideal and have an emf of 10 V? (Hint: This can be answered us-
ing only mental calculation.)
SSM
ideal battery has emf 
V. First, the switch is closed a long
time so that the steady state is reached. Then the switch is opened
at time t ! 0.What is the current in resistor 2 at t ! 4.00 ms?

Figure 27-67 displays two cir-
cuits with a charged capacitor that
is to be discharged through a resis-
tor when a switch is closed. In Fig.
27-67a, R1 ! 20.0 0 and C1 ! 5.00
mF. In Fig. 27-67b, R2 ! 10.0 0 and
C2 ! 8.00 mF.The ratio of the initial
charges on the two capacitors is
q02/q01 ! 1.50. At time t ! 0, both switches are closed. At what
time t do the two capacitors have the same charge?
••67
The potential difference between the plates of a leaky
(meaning that charge leaks from one plate to the other) 2.0 mF
capacitor drops to one-fourth its initial value in 2.0 s. What is the
equivalent resistance between the capacitor plates?
••68
A 1.0 mF capacitor with an initial stored energy of 0.50 J is
discharged through a 1.0 M0 resistor. (a) What is the initial charge
on the capacitor? (b) What is the current through the resistor when
the discharge starts? Find an expression that gives, as a function of
time t, (c) the potential difference VC across the capacitor, (d) the
potential difference VR across the resistor, and (e) the rate at which
thermal energy is produced in the resistor.
•••69
A 3.00 M0 resistor and a 1.00 mF capacitor are
connected in series with an ideal battery of emf 
V.At 1.00 s
after the connection is made, what is the rate at which (a) the
charge of the capacitor is increasing, (b) energy is being stored in
the capacitor, (c) thermal energy is appearing in the resistor, and
(d) energy is being delivered by the battery?

Suppose that, while you are sitting in a chair, charge
separation between your clothing and the chair puts you at a
potential of 200 V, with the capacitance between you and the
chair at 150 pF. When you stand up, the increased separation
between your body and the chair decreases the capacitance to
10 pF. (a) What then is the potential of your body? That poten-
tial is reduced over time, as the charge on you drains through
your body and shoes (you are a capacitor discharging through a
resistance). Assume that the resistance along that route is 300
G0. If you touch an electrical component while your potential
is greater than 100 V, you could ruin the component. (b) How
long must you wait until your potential reaches the safe level of
100 V?
If you wear a conducting wrist strap that is connected to
ground, your potential does not increase as much when you stand
up; you also discharge more rapidly because the resistance through
the grounding connection is much less than through your body and
shoes. (c) Suppose that when you stand up, your potential is 1400 V
and the chair-to-you capacitance is 10 pF. What resistance in that
wrist-strap grounding connection will allow you to discharge to 100
V in 0.30 s, which is less time than you would need to reach for, say,
your computer?
