FORCE AND MOTION—I
Sample Problem 5.01
One- and two-dimensional forces, puck
Here are examples of how to use Newton’s second law for a
puck when one or two forces act on it. Parts A, B, and C of
Fig. 5-3 show three situations in which one or two forces act
on a puck that moves over frictionless ice along an x axis, in
one-dimensional motion. The puck’s mass is m " 0.20 kg.
Forces 
and 
are directed along the axis and have
magnitudes F1

at angle u " 303 and has magnitude F3 " 1.0 N. In each situ-
ation, what is the acceleration of the puck?
KEY IDEA
In each situation we can relate the acceleration 
to the net
force 
acting on the puck with Newton’s second law,
. However, because the motion is along only the x
axis, we can simplify each situation by writing the second
law for x components only:
Fnet, x " max.
(5-4)
The free-body diagrams for the three situations are also
given in Fig. 5-3, with the puck represented by a dot.
Situation A: For Fig. 5-3b, where only one horizontal force
acts, Eq. 5-4 gives us
F1 " max,
which, with given data, yields
(Answer)
The positive answer indicates that the acceleration is in the
positive direction of the x axis.
Situation B: In Fig. 5-3d, two horizontal forces act on the
puck,
in the positive direction of x and 
in the negative
direction. Now Eq. 5-4 gives us
F1 $ F2 " max,
which, with given data, yields
(Answer)
Thus, the net force accelerates the puck in the positive direc-
tion of the x axis.
Situation C: In Fig. 5-3f, force 
is not directed along the
direction of the puck’s acceleration; only x component F3,x
is. (Force 
is two-dimensional but the motion is only one-

From the figure, we see that F3,x " F3 cos u. Solving for the
acceleration and substituting for F3,x yield

Thus, the net force accelerates the puck in the negative di-
rection of the x axis.
