19-6 THE DISTRIBUTION OF MOLECULAR SPEEDS
The Distribution of Molecular Speeds
The root-mean-square speed vrms gives us a general idea of molecular speeds in
a gas at a given temperature. We often want to know more. For example, what
fraction of the molecules have speeds greater than the rms value? What fraction
have speeds greater than twice the rms value? To answer such questions, we need
to know how the possible values of speed are distributed among the molecules.
Figure 19-8a shows this distribution for oxygen molecules at room temperature
(T # 300 K); Fig. 19-8b compares it with the distribution at T # 80 K.
In 1852, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell first solved the problem of
finding the speed distribution of gas molecules. His result, known as Maxwell’s
speed distribution law, is
.
(19-27)
Here M is the molar mass of the gas, R is the gas constant, T is the gas temper-
ature, and v is the molecular speed. It is this equation that is plotted in 
Fig. 19-8a, b.The quantity P(v) in Eq. 19-27 and Fig. 19-8 is a probability distribu-
tion function: For any speed v, the product P(v) dv (a dimensionless quantity) is
the fraction of molecules with speeds in the interval dv centered on speed v.
As Fig. 19-8a shows, this fraction is equal to the area of a strip with height
P(v) and width dv.The total area under the distribution curve corresponds to the
fraction of the molecules whose speeds lie between zero and infinity. All
molecules fall into this category, so the value of this total area is unity; that is,
(19-28)
The fraction (frac) of molecules with speeds in an interval of, say, v1 to v2 is then
(19-29)
Average, RMS, and Most Probable Speeds
In principle, we can find the average speed vavg of the molecules in a gas with the fol-
lowing procedure:We weight each value of v in the distribution; that is, we multiply it

molecules at T # 300 K.The three characteristic speeds are
marked. (b) The curves for 300 K and 80 K. Note that the
molecules move more slowly at the lower temperature. Because
these are probability distributions, the area under each curve
has a numerical value of unity.
