The Angular Momentum of a System of Particles
Now we turn our attention to the angular momentum of a system of particles with
respect to an origin. The total angular momentum 
of the system is the (vector)
sum of the angular momenta 
of the individual particles (here with label i):
(11-26)
With time, the angular momenta of individual particles may change because
of interactions between the particles or with the outside.We can find the resulting
change in 
by taking the time derivative of Eq. 11-26.Thus,
(11-27)
From Eq. 11-23, we see that 
is equal to the net torque 
on the ith
particle.We can rewrite Eq. 11-27 as
(11-28)
That is, the rate of change of the system’s angular momentum 
is equal to the
vector sum of the torques on its individual particles. Those torques include inter-
nal torques (due to forces between the particles) and external torques (due to
forces on the particles from bodies external to the system). However, the forces
between the particles always come in third-law force pairs so their torques sum to
zero. Thus, the only torques that can change the total angular momentum 
of
the system are the external torques acting on the system.
Net External Torque. Let 
represent the net external torque, the vector
sum of all external torques on all particles in the system. Then we can write
Eq. 11-28 as
(system of particles),
(11-29)

ROLLING, TORQUE, AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM
11-7 ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF A RIGID BODY
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
11.22 For a system of particles, apply Newton’s second law
in angular form to relate the net torque acting on the 
system to the rate of the resulting change in the system’s
angular momentum.
11.23 Apply the relationship between the angular momentum
of a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis and the body’s
rotational inertia and angular speed around that axis.
11.24 If two rigid bodies rotate about the same axis, calculate
their total angular momentum.
●The angular momentum 
of a system of particles is 
the vector sum of the angular momenta of the individual 
particles:
●The time rate of change of this angular momentum is equal
to the net external torque on the system (the vector sum of

of its angular momentum parallel to the rotation axis is
