clusion principle—the conduction electrons are stacked up in the partially filled
band of Fig. 41-5 with energies that range from zero to the Fermi energy.
How Many Conduction Electrons Are There?
If we could bring individual atoms together to form a sample of a metal, we would
find that the conduction electrons in the metal are the valence electrons of the atoms
(the electrons in the outermost occupied shells of the atoms). A monovalent atom
contributes one such electron to the conduction electrons in a metal; a bivalent atom
contributes two such electrons.Thus,the total number of conduction electrons is
(41-2)
(In this chapter, we shall write several equations largely in words because the
symbols we have previously used for the quantities in them now represent other
quantities.) The number density n of conduction electrons in a sample is the num-
ber of conduction electrons per unit volume:
(41-3)
We can relate the number of atoms in a sample to various other properties of
the sample and to the material making up the sample with the following:
(41-4)
where the molar mass M is the mass of one mole of the material in the sample
and NA is Avogadro’s number (6.02 " 10 23 mol #1).

Sample Problem 41.02
Number of conduction electrons in a metal
How many conduction electrons are in a cube of magnesium
of volume 2.00 " 10#6 m3? Magnesium atoms are bivalent.
KEY IDEAS
1.
Because magnesium atoms are bivalent, each magne-
sium atom contributes two conduction electrons.
2.
The cube’s number of conduction electrons is related to
its number of magnesium atoms by Eq. 41-2.
3.
We can find the number of atoms with Eq.41-4 and known
data about the cube’s volume and magnesium’s properties.
Calculations: We can write Eq. 41-4 as
Magnesium has density 1.738 g/cm3 (! 1.738 " 103 kg/m3)
