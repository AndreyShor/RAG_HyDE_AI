(b) What is the value of M for N1 ! N2 ! 1200 turns,
R2 ! 1.1 cm, and R1 ! 15 cm?
Calculations: Equation 30-69 yields
(Answer)
Consider the situation if we reverse the roles of the two
coils—that is, if we produce a current i2 in the smaller coil
and try to calculate M from Eq. 30-57 in the form
The calculation of 012 (the nonuniform flux of the smaller
coil’s magnetic field encompassed by the larger coil) is not
simple. If we were to do the calculation numerically using
a computer, we would find M to be 2.3 mH, as above! This
emphasizes that Eq. 30-63 (M21 ! M12 ! M) is not obvious.

Figure 30-20 shows two circular close-packed coils, the
smaller (radius R2, with N2 turns) being coaxial with the
larger (radius R1, with N1 turns) and in the same plane.
(a) Derive an expression for the mutual inductance M for
this arrangement of these two coils, assuming that R1 / R2.
KEY IDEA
The mutual inductance M for these coils is the ratio of the
flux linkage (N0) through one coil to the current i in the
other coil, which produces that flux linkage. Thus, we need
to assume that currents exist in the coils; then we need to
calculate the flux linkage in one of the coils.
Calculations: The magnetic field through the larger coil
due to the smaller coil is nonuniform in both magnitude and
direction; so the flux through the larger coil due to the
smaller coil is nonuniform and difficult to calculate.
However, the smaller coil is small enough for us to assume
that the magnetic field through it due to the larger coil is ap-
proximately uniform. Thus, the flux through it due to the
larger coil is also approximately uniform. Hence, to find M
we shall assume a current i1 in the larger coil and calculate
the flux linkage N2021 in the smaller coil:
(30-66)
The flux 021 through each turn of the smaller coil is,
from Eq. 30-2,
021 ! B1A2,
where B1 is the magnitude of the magnetic field at points
within the small coil due to the larger coil and 
is
the area enclosed by the turn. Thus, the flux linkage in the
smaller coil (with its N2 turns) is
N2021 ! N2B1A2.
(30-67)
To find B1 at points within the smaller coil, we can use
Eq. 29-26,
with z set to 0 because the smaller coil is in the plane of the
larger coil.That equation tells us that each turn of the larger
coil produces a magnetic field of magnitude m0i1/2R1 at
points within the smaller coil. Thus, the larger coil (with its
N1 turns) produces a total magnetic field of magnitude
(30-68)
at points within the smaller coil.
