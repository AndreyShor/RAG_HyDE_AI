THE  LORENTZ  TRANSFORMATION 
THE    results   of    the   last    three    sections   show 
that   the  apparent  incompatibility  of  the   law 
of  propagation  of  light  with  the  principle  of 
relativity  (Section  VII)  has  been  derived  by  means  of 
a    consideration    which    borrowed    two    unjustifiable 
hypotheses   from   classical    mechanics;    these    are   as 
follows : 
(1)  The  time-interval  (time)  between  two  events  is 
independent  of  the  condition  of  motion  of  the 
body  of  reference. 
(2)  The  space-interval  (distance)  between  two  points 
of  a  rigid  body  is  independent  of  the  condition 
of  motion  of  the  body  of  reference. 
If  we  drop  these  hypotheses,  then  the  dilemma  of 
Section  VII  disappears,  because  the  theorem  of  the  addi 
tion  of  velocities  derived  in  Section  VI  becomes  invalid. 
The  possibility  presents  itself  that  the  law  of  the  pro 
pagation  of  light  in  vacuo  may  be  compatible  with  the 
principle  of  relativity,  and  the  question  arises  :  How 
have  we  to  modify  the  considerations  of  Section  VI 
in  order  to  remove  the  apparent  disagreement  between 
these  two  fundamental  results  of  experience  ?  This 
question  leads  to  a  general  one.  In  the  discussion  of
