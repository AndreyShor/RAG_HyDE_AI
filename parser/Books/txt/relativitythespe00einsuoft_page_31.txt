If  K  is  a  Galileian  co-ordinate  system,  then  every  other 
co-ordinate  system  K'  is  a  Galileian  one,  when,  in  rela 
tion  to  K,  it  is  in  a  condition  of  uniform  motion  of  trans 
lation.  Relative  to  K'  the  mechanical  laws  of  Galilei- 
Newton  hold  good  exactly  as  they  do  with  respect  to  K. 
We  advance  a  step  farther  in  our  generalisation  when 
we  express  the  tenet  thus  :  If,  relative  to  K,  K'  is  a 
uniformly  moving  co-ordinate  system  devoid  of  rotation, 
then  natural  phenomena  run  their  course  with  respect  to 
K'  according  to  exactly  the  same  general  laws  as  with 
respect  to  K.  This  statement  is  called  the  principle 
of  relativity  (in  the  restricted  sense). 
As  long  as  one  was  convinced  that  all  natural  pheno 
mena  were  capable  of  representation  with  the  help  of 
classical  mechanics,  there  was  no  need  to  doubt  the 
validity  of  this  principle  of  relativity.  But  in  view  of 
the  more  recent  development  of  electrodynamics  and 
optics  it  became  more  and  more  evident  that  classical 
mechanics  affords  an  insufficient  foundation  for  the 
physical  description  of  all  natural  phenomena.  At  this 
juncture  the  question  of  the  validity  of  the  principle  of 
relativity  became  ripe  for  discussion,  and  it  did  not 
appear  impossible  that  the  answer  to  this  question 
might  be  in  the  negative. 
Nevertheless,  there  are  two  general  facts  which  at  the 
outset  speak  very  much  in  favour  of  the  validity  of  the 
principle  of  relativity.  Even  though  classical  mechanics 
does  not  supply  us  with  a  sufficiently  broad  basis  for  the 
theoretical  presentation  of  all  physical  phenomena, 
still  we  must  grant  it  a  considerable  measure  of  "  truth," 
since  it  supplies  us  with  the  actual  motions  of  the 
heavenly  bodies  with  a  delicacy  of  detail  little  short  of 
wonderful.  The  principle  of  relativity  must  therefore
