rA ! 10 cm is coupled by belt B to
wheel C of radius rC ! 25 cm.The an-

not slip. (Hint: If the belt does not slip, the linear speeds at the two
rims must be equal.)

A vinyl record is played by rotating the record so that an ap-
proximately circular groove in the vinyl slides under a stylus.
Bumps in the groove run into the stylus, causing it to oscillate. The
equipment converts those oscillations to electrical signals and then
to sound. Suppose that a record turns at the rate of

groove being played is at a radius of 10.0 cm, and the bumps in the
groove are uniformly separated by 1.75 mm.At what rate (hits per
second) do the bumps hit the stylus?
