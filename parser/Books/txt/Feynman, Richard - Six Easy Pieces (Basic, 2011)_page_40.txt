indicated in Fig. 1-4: the molecules lock into a new pattern which
is ice. This particular schematic diagram of ice is wrong because it
is in two dimensions, but it is right qualitatively. The interesting
point is that the material has a deﬁnite place for every atom, and you
can easily appreciate that if somehow or other we were to hold all
the atoms at one end of the drop in a certain arrangement, each
atom in a certain place, then because of the structure of intercon-
nections, which is rigid, the other end miles away (at our magniﬁed
scale) will have a deﬁnite location. So if we hold a needle of ice at
one end, the other end resists our pushing it aside, unlike the case
of water, in which the structure is broken down because of the in-
creased jiggling so that the atoms all move around in different ways.
The difference between solids and liquids is, then, that in a solid
the atoms are arranged in some kind of an array, called a crystalline
array, and they do not have a random position at long distances;
the position of the atoms on one side of the crystal is determined
by that of other atoms millions of atoms away on the other side of
the crystal. Figure 1-4 is an invented arrangement for ice, and al-
though it contains many of the correct features of ice, it is not the
true arrangement. One of the correct features is that there is a part
of the symmetry that is hexagonal. You can see that if we turn the
picture around an axis by 60°, the picture returns to itself. So there
is a symmetry in the ice which accounts for the six-sided appearance
of snowﬂakes. Another thing we can see from Fig. 1-4 is why ice
