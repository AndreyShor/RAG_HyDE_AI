Figure 21-30a shows an arrangement of three charged
particles separated by distance d. Particles A and C are fixed on
the x axis, but particle B can be moved along a circle centered on
particle A. During the movement, a radial line between A and B
makes an angle u relative to the positive direction of the x axis
(Fig. 21-30b). The curves in Fig. 21-30c give, for two situations, the
magnitude Fnet of the net electrostatic force on particle A due to the
other particles.That net force is given as a function of angle u and as
a multiple of a basic amount F0. For example on curve 1, at u # 180-,
we see that Fnet # 2F0. (a) For the situation corresponding to curve 1,
what is the ratio of the charge of particle C to that of particle B (in-
cluding sign)? (b) For the situation corresponding to curve 2, what is
that ratio?

charge q3 # "8.00 ' 10$19 C) is to be placed on the line between par-
ticles 1 and 2 so that they produce a net electrostatic force 
on it.

In Fig. 21-29a, three positively
charged particles are fixed on an x
axis. Particles B and C are so close
to each other that they can be con-
sidered to be at the same distance
from particle A. The net force on
particle A due to particles B and
C is 2.014 ' 10 $23 N in the negative
direction of the x axis. In Fig. 21-
29b, particle B has been moved to the opposite side of A but is still
at the same distance from it. The net force on A is now 2.877 '
10 $24 N in the negative direction of the x axis. What is the ratio
qC/qB?
