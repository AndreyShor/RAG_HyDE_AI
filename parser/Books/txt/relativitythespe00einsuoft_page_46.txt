X 
ON    THE    RELATIVITY    OF   THE   CONCEPTION 
OF  DISTANCE 
LET  
us  consider  two  particular  points  on  the  train l 
travelling  along  the  embankment  with  the 
velocity  v,  and  inquire  as  to  their  distance  apart. 
We  already  know  that  it  is  necessary  to  have  a  body  of 
reference  for  the  measurement  of  a  distance,  with  respect 
to  which  body  the  distance  can  be  measured  up.  It  is 
the  simplest  plan  to  use  the  train  itself  as  reference- 
body  (co-ordinate  system).  An  observer  in  the  train 
measures,  the  interval  by  marking  off  his  measuring-rod 
in  a  straight  line  (e.g.  along  the  floor  of  the  carriage) 
as  many  times  as  is  necessary  to  take  him  from  the  one 
marked  point  to  the  other.  Then  the  number  which 
tells  us  how  often  the  rod  has  to  be  laid  down  is  the 
required  distance. 
It  is  a  different  matter  when  the  distance  has  to  be 
judged  from  the  railway  line.  Here  the  following 
method  suggests  itself.  If  we  call  A'  and  B'  the  two 
points  on  the  train  whose  distance  apart  is  required, 
then  both  of  these  points  are  moving  with  the  velocity  v 
along  the  embankment.  In  the  first  place  we  require  to 
determine  the  points  A  and  B  of  the  embankment  which 
are  just  being  passed  by  the  two  points  A'  and  B'  at  a 
1  e.g.  the  middle  of  the  first  and  of  the  hundredth  carriage.
