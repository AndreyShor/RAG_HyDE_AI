CHAPTER 19
THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES
(Answer)
In words, about 71% of the energy transferred to the gas
goes into the internal energy.The rest goes into the work re-
quired to increase the volume of the gas, as the gas pushes
the walls of its container outward.
Increases in K: If we were to increase the temperature of a
monatomic gas (with the same value of n) by the amount
given in Eq. 19-52, the internal energy would change by a
smaller amount, call it %Eint, mon, because rotational motion
is not involved.To calculate that smaller amount, we still use
Eq. 19-45 but now we substitute the value of CV for a
monatomic gas—namely,
So,
Substituting for %T from Eq. 19-52 leads us to
For the monatomic gas, all this energy would go into the ki-
netic energy of the translational motion of the atoms.The im-
portant point here is that for a diatomic gas with the same 
values of n and %T, the same amount of energy goes into the
kinetic energy of the translational motion of the molecules.
The rest of %Eint,dia (that is,the additional 285.7 J) goes into the
rotational motion of the molecules.Thus, for the diatomic gas,
%Ktrans # 428.6 J
and
%Krot # 285.7 J.

energy? Of that amount, how much goes into %Ktran (the ki-
netic energy of the translational motion of the molecules) and
%Krot (the kinetic energy of their rotational motion)?
KEY IDEAS
1. The transfer of energy as heat Q to a gas under constant
pressure is related to the resulting temperature increase
%T via Eq. 19-46 (Q # nCp %T ).
2. Because the gas is diatomic with molecules undergoing
rotation but not oscillation, the molar specific heat is,
from Fig. 19-12 and Table 19-3,
.
3. The increase %Eint in the internal energy is the same as
would occur with a constant-volume process resulting in
the same %T.Thus, from Eq. 19-45, %Eint # nCV %T. From
Fig. 19-12 and Table 19-3, we see that 
.
4. For the same n and %T, %Eint is greater for a diatomic gas
than for a monatomic gas because additional energy is
required for rotation.
Increase in Eint: Let’s first get the temperature change %T due
to the transfer of energy as heat. From Eq. 19-46, substituting
for Cp,we have
(19-52)
We next find Eint from Eq. 19-45, substituting the molar
specific heat 
for a constant-volume process and
using the same 
. Because we are dealing with a di-
atomic gas, let’s call this change 
. Equation 19-45

A Hint of Quantum Theory
We can improve the agreement of kinetic theory with experiment by
including the oscillations of the atoms in a gas of diatomic or poly-
atomic molecules. For example, the two atoms in the O2 molecule of
Fig. 19-13b can oscillate toward and away from each other, with the
interconnecting bond acting like a spring. However, experiment
shows that such oscillations occur only at relatively high tempera-
tures of the gas—the motion is “turned on” only when the gas mole-
cules have relatively large energies. Rotational motion is also sub-
ject to such “turning on,” but at a lower temperature.
Figure 19-14 is of help in seeing this turning on of rotational mo-
tion and oscillatory motion. The ratio CV/R for diatomic hydrogen
gas (H2) is plotted there against temperature, with the temperature
scale logarithmic to cover several orders of magnitude. Below about
80 K, we find that CV/R # 1.5.This result implies that only the three
translational degrees of freedom of hydrogen are involved in the
specific heat.

tain energies,only translation is possible at very low tempera-
tures.As the temperature increases,rotational motion can be-
gin.At still higher temperatures,oscillatory motion can begin.
