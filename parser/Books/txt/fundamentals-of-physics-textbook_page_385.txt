This is the force
(pull) on particle 1
due to particle 2.
We want the forces
(pulls) on particle 1,
not the forces on
the other particles.
This is one way to
show the net force
on particle 1. Note
the head-to-tail
arrangement.
This is another way,
also a head-to-tail
arrangement.
A calculator's inverse
tangent can give this
for the angle.
But this is the
correct angle.
This is the force
(pull) on particle 1
due to particle 3.

13-3 GRAVITATION NEAR EARTH’S SURFACE
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
13.06 Distinguish between the free-fall acceleration and the
gravitational acceleration.
13.07 Calculate the gravitational acceleration near but out-
side a uniform, spherical astronomical body.
13.08 Distinguish between measured weight and the magni-
tude of the gravitational force.
●The gravitational acceleration ag of a particle (of mass m) is
due solely to the gravitational force acting on it. When the
particle is at distance r from the center of a uniform, spheri-
cal body of mass M, the magnitude F of the gravitational
force on the particle is given by Eq. 13-1. Thus, by Newton’s
second law,
F ! mag,
which gives
.
●Because Earth’s mass is not distributed uniformly, because
the planet is not perfectly spherical, and because it rotates,
the actual free-fall acceleration 
of a particle near Earth dif-
fers slightly from the gravitational acceleration 
, and the par-
ticle’s weight (equal to mg) differs from the magnitude of the
gravitational force on it.
