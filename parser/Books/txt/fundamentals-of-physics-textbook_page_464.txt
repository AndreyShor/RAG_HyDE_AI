OSCILLATIONS
••34
In Fig. 15-41, block 2 of
mass 2.0 kg oscillates on the end of a
spring in SHM with a period of 20
ms. The block’s position is given by
x $ (1.0 cm) cos(vt % p/2). Block 1
of mass 4.0 kg slides toward block 2
with a velocity of magnitude 6.0 m/s, directed along the spring’s
length. The two blocks undergo a completely inelastic collision at
time t $ 5.0 ms. (The duration of the collision is much less than
the period of motion.) What is the amplitude of the SHM after the
collision?
••35
A 10 g particle undergoes SHM with an amplitude of 2.0 mm,
a maximum acceleration of magnitude 8.0 ( 103 m/s2, and an
unknown phase constant f.What are (a) the period of the motion,
(b) the maximum speed of the particle, and (c) the total mechani-
cal energy of the oscillator? What is the magnitude of the force on
the particle when the particle is at (d) its maximum displacement
and (e) half its maximum displacement?
••36
If the phase angle for a block–spring system in SHM is p/6
rad and the block’s position is given by x $ xm cos(vt % f), what is
the ratio of the kinetic energy to the potential energy at time t $ 0?
•••37
A massless spring hangs from the ceiling with a small ob-
ject attached to its lower end.The object is initially held at rest in a
position yi such that the spring is at its rest length. The object is
then released from yi and oscillates up and down, with its lowest
position being 10 cm below yi. (a) What is the frequency of the os-
cillation? (b) What is the speed of the object when it is 8.0 cm be-
low the initial position? (c) An object of mass 300 g is attached to
the first object, after which the system oscillates with half the origi-
nal frequency.What is the mass of the first object? (d) How far be-
low yi is the new equilibrium (rest) position with both objects at-
tached to the spring?

An Angular Simple Harmonic Oscillator
•38
A 95 kg solid sphere with a 15 cm radius is suspended by a
vertical wire.A torque of 0.20 N*m is required to rotate the sphere
through an angle of 0.85 rad and then maintain that orientation.
What is the period of the oscillations that result when the sphere is
then released?
••39
The balance wheel of an old-fashioned watch
oscillates with angular amplitude p rad and period 0.500 s. Find
(a) the maximum angular speed of the wheel, (b) the angular speed
at displacement p/2 rad, and (c) the magnitude of the angular 
acceleration at displacement p/4 rad.

Pendulums, Circular Motion

A physical pendulum consists of a meter stick that is piv-
oted at a small hole drilled through
the stick a distance d from the 50
cm mark. The period of oscillation
is 2.5 s.Find d.

In Fig. 15-42, the pendu-
lum consists of a uniform disk with
radius r $ 10.0 cm and mass 500 g
attached to a uniform rod with
length L $ 500 mm and mass 270
g. (a) Calculate the rotational iner-
tia of the pendulum about the
pivot point. (b) What is the dis-

oscillation.
•42
Suppose that a simple pendulum consists of a small 60.0 g
bob at the end of a cord of negligible mass. If the angle u between
the cord and the vertical is given by
u $ (0.0800 rad) cos[(4.43 rad/s)t % f],
what are (a) the pendulum’s length and (b) its maximum kinetic
energy?
•43
(a) If the physical pendulum of Fig. 15-13 and the associated
sample problem is inverted and suspended at point P, what is its
period of oscillation? (b) Is the period now greater than, less than,
or equal to its previous value?
•44
A physical pendulum consists of two me-
ter-long sticks joined together as shown in Fig.
15-43. What is the pendulum’s period of oscilla-
tion about a pin inserted through point A at the
center of the horizontal stick?
•45
A performer seated on a trapeze is
swinging back and forth with a period of 8.85 s.
If she stands up, thus raising the center of mass of
the trapeze % performer system by 35.0 cm, what will be the new pe-
riod of the system? Treat trapeze % performer as a simple pendulum.
•46
A physical pendulum has a center of oscillation at distance
2L/3 from its point of suspension. Show that the distance be-
tween the point of suspension and the center of oscillation for a
physical pendulum of any form is I/mh, where I and h have the
meanings in Eq. 15-29 and m is the mass of the pendulum.

In Fig. 15-44, a physical pendulum
consists of a uniform solid disk (of radius
R $ 2.35 cm) supported in a vertical plane
by a pivot located a distance d $ 1.75 cm
from the center of the disk.The disk is dis-
placed by a small angle and released.
What is the period of the resulting simple
harmonic motion?

suspended on a thin horizontal rod running through a narrow hole in
the block. The block is then to be set swinging about the rod like a
pendulum, through small angles so that it is in SHM. Figure 15-45
shows one possible position of the hole, at distance r from the block’s
center, along a line connecting the center with a corner. (a) Plot the
period versus distance r along that
line such that the minimum in the
curve is apparent. (b) For what value
of r does that minimum occur? There
is a line of points around the block’s
center for which the period of swing-
ing has the same minimum value. (c)
What shape does that line make?
