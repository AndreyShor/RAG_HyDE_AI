In Fig. 12-52, uniform beams A
and B are attached to a wall with hinges
and loosely bolted together (there is
no torque of one on the other). Beam
A has length LA ! 2.40 m and mass
54.0 kg; beam B has mass 68.0 kg.The
two hinge points are separated by dis-
tance d ! 1.80 m. In unit-vector nota-
tion, what is the force on (a) beam A
due to its hinge, (b) beam A due to
the bolt, (c) beam B due to its hinge,
and (d) beam B due to the bolt?

For the stepladder shown in
Fig. 12-53, sides AC and CE are each
2.44 m long and hinged at C. Bar BD
is a tie-rod 0.762 m long, halfway up.
A man weighing 854 N climbs 1.80 m
along the ladder. Assuming that the
floor is frictionless and neglecting the
mass of the ladder,find (a) the tension
in the tie-rod and the magnitudes of
the forces on the ladder from the floor
at (b) A and (c) E. (Hint: Isolate parts
of the ladder in applying the equilib-
rium conditions.)

Figure 12-54a shows a horizon-
tal uniform beam of mass mb and
length L that is supported on the left
by a hinge attached to a wall and on the right by a cable at angle u with
the horizontal. A package of mass mp is positioned on the beam at a
distance x from the left end. The total mass is mb # mp ! 61.22 kg.
Figure 12-54b gives the tension T in the cable as a function of the
package’s position given as a fraction x/L of the beam length. The
scale of the T axis is set by Ta ! 500 N and Tb!700 N. Evaluate (a)
angle u,(b) mass mb,and (c) mass mp.

A horizontal aluminum rod 4.8 cm in diameter
projects 5.3 cm from a wall.A 1200 kg object is suspended from the
end of the rod.The shear modulus of aluminum is 3.0 $ 1010 N/m2.
Neglecting the rod’s mass, find (a) the shear stress on the rod and
(b) the vertical deflection of the end of the rod.

the

The scale of the stress axis is set by

In Fig. 12-56, a lead brick rests
horizontally on cylinders A and B.
The areas of the top faces of the cylin-
ders are related by AA ! 2AB; the
Young’s moduli of the cylinders
are related by EA ! 2EB. The cylin-
ders had identical lengths before the
brick was placed on them. What
fraction of the brick’s mass is sup-
ported (a) by cylinder A and (b) by
cylinder B? The horizontal distances
between the center of mass of the
brick and the centerlines of the
cylinders are dA for cylinder A and
dB for cylinder B. (c) What is the ratio dA/dB?

Figure 12-57 shows an approximate plot of stress ver-
sus strain for a spider-web thread, out to the point of breaking at a
strain of 2.00. The vertical axis scale is set by values a ! 0.12
GN/m2, b ! 0.30 GN/m2, and c ! 0.80 GN/m2. Assume that the
thread has an initial length of 0.80 cm,an initial cross-sectional area of
8.0$10%12 m2, and (during stretching) a constant volume. The
strain on the thread is the ratio of the change in the thread’s
length to that initial length, and the stress on the thread is the ra-
tio of the collision force to that initial cross-sectional area.
Assume that the work done on the thread by the collision force is
given by the area under the curve on the graph. Assume also that
when the single thread snares a flying insect, the insect’s kinetic
energy is transferred to the stretching of the thread. (a) How
much kinetic energy would put the thread on the verge of break-
ing? What is the kinetic energy of (b) a fruit fly of mass 6.00 mg
and speed 1.70 m/s and (c) a bumble bee of mass 0.388 g and
speed 0.420 m/s? Would (d) the fruit fly and (e) the bumble bee
break the thread?

A crate, in the form of a cube with edge lengths of 1.2 m, con-
tains a piece of machinery; the center of mass of the crate and its
contents is located 0.30 m above the crate’s geometrical center. The
crate rests on a ramp that makes an angle u with the horizontal.As u
is increased from zero, an angle will be reached at which the crate
will either tip over or start to slide down the ramp. If the coefficient
of static friction ms between ramp and crate is 0.60, (a) does the crate
tip or slide and (b) at what angle u does this occur? If ms ! 0.70,
(c) does the crate tip or slide and (d) at what angle u does this occur?
(Hint:At the onset of tipping,where is the normal force located?)
