CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
What is energy?
In this chapter, we begin our more detailed study of the differ-
ent aspects of physics, having ﬁnished our description of things
in general. To illustrate the ideas and the kind of reasoning that
might be used in theoretical physics, we shall now examine one of
the most basic laws of physics, the conservation of energy.
There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phe-
nomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to
this law—it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the conser-
vation of energy. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we
call energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which
nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a math-
ematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which
does not change when something happens. It is not a description
of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that
we can calculate some number and when we ﬁnish watching nature
go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same.
(Something like the bishop on a red square, and after a number of
moves—details unknown—it is still on some red square. It is a law
