Dividing this result by e gives us the number N of conduc-
tion electrons that come up to the face:

These electrons come from a volume that is the product of the
face area A and the depth d we seek.Thus, from the density of
conduction electrons (number per volume),we can write

(Answer)
We commonly say that electrons move from the battery to
the negative face but, actually, the battery sets up an electric
field in the wires and plate such that electrons very close to
the plate face move up to the negative face.

Sample Problem 25.01
Charging the plates in a parallel-plate capacitor
In Fig. 25-7a, switch S is closed to connect the uncharged
capacitor of capacitance C ! 0.25 mF to the battery of poten-
tial difference V ! 12 V.The lower capacitor plate has thick-
ness L ! 0.50 cm and face area A ! 2.0 $ 10#4 m2, and it
consists of copper, in which the density of conduction elec-
trons is n ! 8.49 $ 1028 electrons/m3. From what depth d
within the plate (Fig. 25-7b) must electrons move to the plate
face as the capacitor becomes charged?
KEY IDEA
The charge collected on the plate is related to the capaci-
tance and the potential difference across the capacitor by
Eq. 25-1 (q ! CV).
Calculations: Because the lower plate is connected to the
negative terminal of the battery, conduction electrons move
up to the face of the plate. From Eq. 25-1, the total charge

25-3 CAPACITORS IN PARALLEL AND IN SERIES
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
25.06 Sketch schematic diagrams for a battery and (a) three
capacitors in parallel and (b) three capacitors in series.
25.07 Identify that capacitors in parallel have the same poten-
tial difference, which is the same value that their equivalent
capacitor has.
25.08 Calculate the equivalent of parallel capacitors.
25.09 Identify that the total charge stored on parallel capacitors is
the sum of the charges stored on the individual capacitors.
25.10 Identify that capacitors in series have the same charge,
which is the same value that their equivalent capacitor has.
25.11 Calculate the equivalent of series capacitors.
25.12 Identify that the potential applied to capacitors in series is
equal to the sum of the potentials across the individual capacitors.
25.13 For a circuit with a battery and some capacitors in
parallel and some in series, simplify the circuit in steps by
finding equivalent capacitors, until the charge and potential
on the final equivalent capacitor can be determined, and
then reverse the steps to find the charge and potential on
the individual capacitors.
25.14 For a circuit with a battery, an open switch, and one or
more uncharged capacitors, determine the amount of
charge that moves through a point in the circuit when the
switch is closed.
25.15 When a charged capacitor is connected in parallel to one or
more uncharged capacitors, determine the charge and potential
difference on each capacitor when equilibrium is reached.
