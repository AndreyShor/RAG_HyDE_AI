CHAPTER 9
CENTER OF MASS AND LINEAR MOMENTUM
••15
Figure 9-44 shows an arrangement with an air track, in which
a cart is connected by a cord to a hanging block. The cart has mass
m1 ! 0.600 kg, and its center is initially at xy coordinates (%0.500
m, 0 m); the block has mass m2 ! 0.400 kg,and its center is initially at
xy coordinates (0,%0.100 m).The mass of the cord and pulley are neg-
ligible. The cart is released from rest, and both cart and block move
until the cart hits the pulley.The friction between the cart and the air
track and between the pulley and its axle is negligible. (a) In unit-vec-
tor notation, what is the acceleration of the center of mass of the
cart–block system? (b) What is the velocity of the com as a function
of time t? (c) Sketch the path taken by the com. (d) If the path is
curved,determine whether it bulges upward to the right or downward
to the left, and if it is straight, find the angle between it and the x axis.
••21
A 0.30 kg softball has a velocity of 15 m/s at an angle of 35# be-
low the horizontal just before making contact with the bat.What is the
magnitude of the change in momentum of the ball while in contact
with the bat if the ball leaves with a velocity of (a) 20 m/s, vertically
downward,and (b) 20 m/s,horizontally back toward the pitcher?

Figure 9-47 gives an overhead
view of the path taken by a 0.165 kg
cue ball as it bounces from a rail of a
pool table. The ball’s initial speed is
2.00 m/s,and the angle u1 is 30.0#.The
bounce reverses the y component of
the ball’s velocity but does not alter
the x component.What are (a) angle
u2 and (b) the change in the ball’s lin-
ear momentum in unit-vector nota-
tion? (The fact that the ball rolls is ir-
relevant to the problem.)

Collision and Impulse

Until his seventies, Henri LaMothe (Fig. 9-48) excited
audiences by belly-flopping from a height of 12 m into 30 cm of
water. Assuming that he stops just as he reaches the bottom of the
water and estimating his mass, find the magnitude of the impulse
on him from the water.

Ricardo, of mass 80 kg, and Carmelita, who is lighter,
are enjoying Lake Merced at dusk in a 30 kg canoe.When the ca-
noe is at rest in the placid water, they exchange seats, which are
3.0 m apart and symmetrically lo-
cated with respect to the canoe’s
center. If the canoe moves 40 cm
horizontally relative to a pier post,
what is Carmelita’s mass?

In Fig. 9-45a, a 4.5 kg dog
stands on an 18 kg flatboat at dis-
tance D ! 6.1 m from the shore. It
walks 2.4 m along the boat toward
shore and then stops. Assuming no
friction between the boat and the wa-
ter, find how far the dog is then from
the shore.(Hint: See Fig.9-45b.)

Linear Momentum

A 0.70 kg ball moving horizontally at 5.0 m/s strikes a vertical
wall and rebounds with speed 2.0 m/s.What is the magnitude of the
change in its linear momentum?
•19
A 2100 kg truck traveling north at 41 km/h turns east
and accelerates to 51 km/h. (a) What is the change in the truck’s
kinetic energy? What are the (b) magnitude and (c) direction of
the change in its momentum?

At time t ! 0, a ball is
struck at ground level and sent over
level ground.The momentum p ver-
sus t during the flight is given by Fig.
9-46 (with 
and
). At what initial
angle is the ball launched? (Hint:
Find a solution that does not
require you to read the time of the
low point of the plot.)

In February 1955, a paratrooper fell 370 m from an air-
plane without being able to open his chute but happened to land in
snow, suffering only minor injuries. Assume that his speed at im-
pact was 56 m/s (terminal speed), that his mass (including gear)
was 85 kg, and that the magnitude of the force on him from the
