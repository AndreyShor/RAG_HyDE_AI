by  a  new  system  with  its  axes  pointing  in  other 
directions. 
Mathematically,  we  can  characterise  the  generalised 
Lorentz  transformation  thus  : 
It  expresses  x' ',  y' ,  z',  t' ,  in  terms  of  linear  homogeneous 
functions  of  x,  y,  z,  t,  of  such  a  kind  that  the  relation 
x'*+y'2+z'2-cH'z=xz+y*+z*-cH2.     .    (na). 
is  satisfied  identically.  That  is  to  say  :  If  we  sub 
stitute  their  expressions  in  x,  y,  z,  t,  in  place  of  x',  y', 
z',  t',  on  the  left-hand  side,  then  the  left-hand  side  of 
(na)  agrees  with  the  right-hand  side.
