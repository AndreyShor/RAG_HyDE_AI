CHAPTER 19
THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES
You can show that if the expansion is now reversed,
with the gas undergoing an isothermal compression from
19 L to 12 L, the work done by the gas will be $1180 J.Thus,
an external force would have to do 1180 J of work on the
gas to compress it.
Sample Problem 19.02
Work by an ideal gas
One mole of oxygen (assume it to be an ideal gas) expands
at a constant temperature T of 310 K from an initial volume
Vi of 12 L to a final volume Vf of 19 L. How much work is
done by the gas during the expansion?
KEY IDEA
Generally we find the work by integrating the gas pressure
with respect to the gas volume, using Eq. 19-11. However,
because the gas here is ideal and the expansion is isother-
mal, that integration leads to Eq. 19-14.
Calculation: Therefore, we can write
# 1180 J.
(Answer)
The expansion is graphed in the p-V diagram of Fig. 19-3.
The work done by the gas during the expansion is repre-
sented by the area beneath the curve if.

19-3 PRESSURE, TEMPERATURE, AND RMS SPEED
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
19.14 Identify that the pressure on the interior walls of a gas
container is due to the molecular collisions with the walls.
19.15 Relate the pressure on a container wall to the momen-
tum of the gas molecules and the time intervals between
their collisions with the wall.
19.16 For the molecules of an ideal gas, relate the root-
mean-square speed vrms and the average speed vavg.
19.17 Relate the pressure of an ideal gas to the rms speed
vrms of the molecules.
19.18 For an ideal gas, apply the relationship between the
gas temperature T and the rms speed vrms and molar mass
M of the molecules.

Key Ideas
Pressure, Temperature, and RMS Speed
Here is our first kinetic theory problem. Let n moles of an ideal gas be confined
in a cubical box of volume V, as in Fig. 19-4. The walls of the box are held at
temperature T.What is the connection between the pressure p exerted by the gas
on the walls and the speeds of the molecules?
