Q3 # cliqm(Tf $ Ti)
# (4186.8 J/kg9K)(0.720 kg)(15-C $ 0°C)
# 45 217 J % 45.22 kJ.
Total: The total required heat Qtot is the sum of the
amounts required in the three steps:
Qtot # Q1 " Q2 " Q3
# 15.98 kJ " 239.8 kJ " 45.22 kJ
% 300 kJ.
(Answer)
Note that most of the energy goes into melting the ice rather
than raising the temperature.
(b) If we supply the ice with a total energy of only 210 kJ (as
heat), what are the final state and temperature of the water?
KEY IDEA
From step 1, we know that 15.98 kJ is needed to raise the
temperature of the ice to the melting point. The remaining
heat Qrem is then 210 kJ $ 15.98 kJ, or about 194 kJ. From
step 2, we can see that this amount of heat is insufficient to
melt all the ice. Because the melting of the ice is incomplete,
we must end up with a mixture of ice and liquid; the temper-
ature of the mixture must be the freezing point, 0-C.
Calculations: We can find the mass m of ice that is melted by
the available energy Qrem by using Eq.18-16 with LF:
Thus, the mass of the ice that remains is 720 g $ 580 g, or
140 g, and we have
580 g water
and
140 g ice,
at 0-C.

Sample Problem 18.04
Heat to change temperature and state
(a) How much heat must be absorbed by ice of mass m #
720 g at $10-C to take it to the liquid state at 15-C?
KEY IDEAS
The heating process is accomplished in three steps: (1) The
ice cannot melt at a temperature below the freezing
point—so initially, any energy transferred to the ice as
heat can only increase the temperature of the ice, until 0-C is
reached. (2) The temperature then cannot increase until all
the ice melts—so any energy transferred to the ice as heat
now can only change ice to liquid water, until all the ice melts.
(3) Now the energy transferred to the liquid water as heat can
only increase the temperature of the liquid water.
Warming the ice: The heat Q1 needed to take the ice from
the initial Ti # $10-C to the final Tf # 0-C (so that the ice
can then melt) is given by Eq. 18-14 (Q # cm %T). Using the
specific heat of ice cice in Table 18-3 gives us
Q1 # cicem(Tf $ Ti)
# (2220 J/kg9K)(0.720 kg)[0-C $ ($10-C)]
# 15 984 J % 15.98 kJ.
Melting the ice: The heat Q2 needed to melt all the ice is
given by Eq. 18-16 (Q # Lm). Here L is the heat of fusion
LF, with the value given in Eq. 18-18 and Table 18-4.We find
Q2 # LFm # (333 kJ/kg)(0.720 kg) % 239.8 kJ.
Warming the liquid: The heat Q3 needed to increase the
temperature of the water from the initial value Ti # 0-C to
the final value Tf # 15-C is given by Eq. 18-14 (with the spe-
cific heat of liquid water cliq):
Substituting Eqs.18-19 through 18-21 into Eq.18-22 yields
cwmw(Tf $ Ti) " Cb(Tf $ Ti) " ccmc(Tf $ T) # 0.
(18-23)
Temperatures are contained in Eq. 18-23 only as differences.
Thus, because the differences on the Celsius and Kelvin
scales are identical, we can use either of those scales in this
equation. Solving it for Tf, we obtain
Using Celsius temperatures and taking values for cc and cw
from Table 18-3, we find the numerator to be
(0.0923 cal/g9K)(75 g)(312-C) " (45 cal/K)(12-C)
" (1.00 cal/g9K)(220 g)(12-C) # 5339.8 cal,
Tf # ccmcT " CbTi " cwmwTi
cwmw " Cb " ccmc
.
and the denominator to be
(1.00 cal/g9K)(220 g) " 45 cal/K
" (0.0923 cal/g9K)(75 g) # 271.9 cal/C-.
We then have
(Answer)
From the given data you can show that
Qw % 1670 cal,
Qb % 342 cal,
Qc % $2020 cal.
Apart from rounding errors, the algebraic sum of these
three heat transfers is indeed zero, as required by the con-
servation of energy (Eq. 18-22).
