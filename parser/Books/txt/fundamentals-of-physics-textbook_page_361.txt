12-2 SOME EXAMPLES OF STATIC EQUILIBRIUM
line extending through the force vector), so that its tail is on
the dot. (The shift does not alter a torque due to 
about
any axis perpendicular to the figure.Thus,the shift does not af-
fect the torque balancing equation that we shall be using.)
The only force on the ladder from the wall is the hori-
zontal force 
(there cannot be a frictional force along a
frictionless wall, so there is no vertical force on the ladder
from the wall). The force F
:
p on the ladder from the pave-
ment has two components: a horizontal component F
:
px that
is a static frictional force and a vertical component F
:
py that is
a normal force.
To apply the balancing equations, let’s start with the
torque balancing of Eq. 12-9 (tnet,z ! 0). To choose an axis
about which to calculate the torques, note that we have
unknown forces (
and F
:
p) at the two ends of the ladder.To
eliminate, say, F
:
p from the calculation, we place the axis at
point O, perpendicular to the figure (Fig. 12-7b). We also
place the origin of an xy coordinate system at O.We can find
torques about O with any of Eqs. 10-39 through 10-41, but
Eq. 10-41 (t ! r"F) is easiest to use here. Making a wise
choice about the placement of the origin can make our torque
calculation much easier.
To find the moment arm r" of the horizontal force 
w
from the wall, we draw a line of action through that vector

Sample Problem 12.03
Balancing a leaning ladder
In Fig. 12-7a, a ladder of length L ! 12 m and mass m !
45 kg leans against a slick wall (that is, there is no friction
between the ladder and the wall). The ladder’s upper end is
at height h ! 9.3 m above the pavement on which the lower
end is supported (the pavement is not frictionless). The 
ladder’s center of mass is L/3 from the lower end, along the
length of the ladder.A firefighter of mass M ! 72 kg climbs
the ladder until her center of mass is L/2 from the lower
end. What then are the magnitudes of the forces on the lad-
der from the wall and the pavement?
KEY IDEAS
First, we choose our system as being the firefighter and lad-
der, together, and then we draw the free-body diagram of
Fig. 12-7b to show the forces acting on the system. Because
the system is in static equilibrium, the balancing equations
for both forces and torques (Eqs. 12-7 through 12-9) can be
applied to it.
Calculations: In Fig.12-7b,the firefighter is represented with
a dot within the boundary of the ladder. The gravitational
force on her is represented with its equivalent expression 
and that vector has been shifted along its line of action (the
