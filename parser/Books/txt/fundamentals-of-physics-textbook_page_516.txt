CHAPTER 17
WAVES—II
The Decibel Scale
The displacement amplitude at the human ear ranges from about 10$5 m for
the loudest tolerable sound to about 10$11 m for the faintest detectable sound,
a ratio of 106. From Eq. 17-27 we see that the intensity of a sound varies as the
square of its amplitude, so the ratio of intensities at these two limits of the hu-
man auditory system is 1012. Humans can hear over an enormous range of 
intensities.
We deal with such an enormous range of values by using logarithms.
Consider the relation
y # log x,
in which x and y are variables. It is a property of this equation that if we multiply
x by 10, then y increases by 1.To see this, we write
y, # log(10x) # log 10 " log x # 1 " y.
Similarly, if we multiply x by 1012, y increases by only 12.
Thus, instead of speaking of the intensity I of a sound wave, it is much more
convenient to speak of its sound level b, defined as
(17-29)
Here dB is the abbreviation for decibel, the unit of sound level, a name that was
chosen to recognize the work of Alexander Graham Bell. I0 in Eq. 17-29 is a
standard reference intensity (# 10$12 W/m2), chosen because it is near the lower
limit of the human range of hearing. For I # I0, Eq. 17-29 gives b # 10 log 1 # 0,
so our standard reference level corresponds to zero decibels. Then b increases
by 10 dB every time the sound intensity increases by an order of magnitude
(a factor of 10). Thus, b # 40 corresponds to an intensity that is 104 times
the standard reference level. Table 17-2 lists the sound levels for a variety of 
environments.
Derivation of Eq. 17-27
Consider, in Fig. 17-4a, a thin slice of air of thickness dx, area A, and mass dm,
oscillating back and forth as the sound wave of Eq. 17-12 passes through it. The
kinetic energy dK of the slice of air is
(17-30)
Here vs is not the speed of the wave but the speed of the oscillating element of air,
obtained from Eq.17-12 as
Using this relation and putting dm # rA dx allow us to rewrite Eq. 17-30 as
dK # (rA dx)($vsm)2 sin2(kx $ vt).
(17-31)
Dividing Eq. 17-31 by dt gives the rate at which kinetic energy moves along with
the wave. As we saw in Chapter 16 for transverse waves, dx/dt is the wave speed
v, so we have
rAvv2s2
m sin2(kx $ vt).

Sound can cause the wall of a drinking
glass to oscillate. If the sound produces a
standing wave of oscillations and if the
intensity of the sound is large enough, the
glass will shatter.
