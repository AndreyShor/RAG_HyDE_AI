Manipulating Eq. 9-23 by substituting for 
from Eq. 9-22 gives, for constant
mass m,
Thus, the relations 
and 
are equivalent expressions of
Newton’s second law of motion for a particle.

9-3 LINEAR MOMENTUM
Checkpoint 3
The figure gives the magnitude p of the linear mo-
mentum versus time t for a particle moving along
an axis.A force directed along the axis acts on the
particle.(a) Rank the four regions indicated ac-
cording to the magnitude of the force,greatest
first.(b) In which region is the particle slowing?
The Linear Momentum of a System of Particles
Let’s extend the definition of linear momentum to a system of particles. Consider
a system of n particles, each with its own mass, velocity, and linear momentum.
The particles may interact with each other, and external forces may act on them.
The system as a whole has a total linear momentum 
which is defined to be the
vector sum of the individual particles’ linear momenta.Thus,
(9-24)
If we compare this equation with Eq. 9-17, we see that
(linear momentum, system of particles),

The linear momentum of a system of particles is equal to the product of the total
mass M of the system and the velocity of the center of mass.
Force and Momentum. If we take the time derivative of Eq. 9-25 (the veloc-
ity can change but not the mass), we find
(9-26)
Comparing Eqs. 9-14 and 9-26 allows us to write Newton’s second law for a sys-
tem of particles in the equivalent form
(system of particles),
(9-27)
where 
is the net external force acting on the system.This equation is the gen-
eralization of the single-particle equation 
to a system of many 
particles. In words, the equation says that the net external force 
on a system
of particles changes the linear momentum 
of the system. Conversely, the linear
momentum can be changed only by a net external force. If there is no net exter-
nal force,
cannot change. Again, this fact gives us an extremely powerful tool
for solving problems.
