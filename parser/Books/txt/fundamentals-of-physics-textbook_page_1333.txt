Because of the 1986 explosion and fire in a reactor at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine, part of
Ukraine is contaminated with 137Cs, which undergoes beta-minus
decay with a half-life of 30.2 y. In 1996, the total activity of this con-
tamination over an area of 2.6 " 105 km2 was estimated to be 1 "
1016 Bq. Assume that the 137Cs is uniformly spread over that area
and that the beta-decay electrons travel either directly upward or
directly downward. How many beta-decay electrons would you in-
tercept were you to lie on the ground in that area for 1 h (a) in 1996
and (b) today? (You need to estimate your cross-sectional area
that intercepts those electrons.)

Figure 42-20 shows part of the decay scheme of 237Np on a plot
of mass number A versus proton number Z; five lines that represent
either alpha decay or beta-minus decay connect dots that represent
isotopes.What is the isotope at the end of the five decays (as marked
with a question mark in Fig.42-20)?

A projectile alpha particle is headed directly toward a
target aluminum nucleus. Both objects are assumed to be spheres.
What energy is required of the alpha particle if it is to momentarily
stop just as its “surface” touches the “surface” of the aluminum nu-
cleus? Assume that the target nucleus remains stationary.

Consider a 238U nucleus to be made up of an alpha particle
(4He) and a residual nucleus (234Th). Plot the electrostatic potential
energy U(r), where r is the distance between these particles. Cover
the approximate range 10 fm / r / 100 fm and compare your plot
with that of Fig. 42-10.

Characteristic nuclear time is a useful but loosely defined
quantity, taken to be the time required for a nucleon with a few
million electron-volts of kinetic energy to travel a distance equal to
the diameter of a middle-mass nuclide.What is the order of magni-
tude of this quantity? Consider 5 MeV neutrons traversing a nu-
clear diameter of 197Au; use Eq. 42-3.

If the unit for atomic mass were defined so that the mass of 1H

High-mass radionuclides, which may be either alpha or beta
emitters, belong to one of four decay chains, depending on whether
their mass number A is of the form 4n, 4n ' 1, 4n ' 2, or 4n ' 3,
where n is a positive integer. (a) Justify this statement and show that
if a nuclide belongs to one of these families,all its decay products be-
long to the same family. Classify the following nuclides as to family:
(b) 235U, (c) 236U, (d) 238U, (e) 239Pu, (f) 240Pu, (g) 245Cm, (h) 246Cm, (i)

At the end of World War II, Dutch authorities arrested Dutch
artist Hans van Meegeren for treason because, during the war, he
had sold a masterpiece painting to the Nazi Hermann Goering.The
painting, Christ and His Disciples at Emmaus by Dutch master
Johannes Vermeer (1632–1675), had been discovered in 1937 by
van Meegeren, after it had been lost for almost 300 years. Soon af-
ter the discovery, art experts proclaimed that Emmaus was possi-
bly the best Vermeer ever seen. Selling such a Dutch national
treasure to the enemy was unthinkable treason.
However, shortly after being imprisoned, van Meegeren sud-
denly announced that he, not Vermeer, had painted Emmaus. He

After a brief neutron irradiation of silver, two isotopes are
present: 108Ag (T1/2 ! 2.42 min) with an initial decay rate of 3.1 "
105/s, and 110Ag (T1/2 ! 24.6 s) with an initial decay rate of 4.1 "
106/s. Make a semilog plot similar to Fig. 42-9 showing the total
combined decay rate of the two isotopes as a function of time from
t ! 0 until t ! 10 min.We used Fig. 42-9 to illustrate the extraction
of the half-life for simple (one isotope) decays. Given only your
plot of total decay rate for the two-isotope system here, suggest a
way to analyze it in order to find the half-lives of both isotopes.

Because a nucleon is confined to a nucleus, we can take the
uncertainty in its position to be approximately the nuclear radius r.
Use the uncertainty principle to determine the uncertainty )p in
the linear momentum of the nucleon. Using the approximation 
p % )p and the fact that the nucleon is nonrelativistic, calculate the
kinetic energy of the nucleon in a nucleus with A ! 100.

A radium source contains 1.00 mg of 226Ra, which decays with
a half-life of 1600 y to produce 222Rn, a noble gas. This radon iso-
tope in turn decays by alpha emission with a half-life of 3.82 d. If
this process continues for a time much longer than the half-life of
222Rn, the 222Rn decay rate reaches a limiting value that matches
the rate at which 222Rn is being produced, which is approximately
constant because of the relatively long half-life of 226Ra. For the
source under this limiting condition, what are (a) the activity of
226Ra, (b) the activity of 222Rn, and (c) the total mass of 222Rn?
