110    CONSIDERATIONS  ON  THE  UNIVERSE 
free  ends  of  these  lines  a  "  circle."  For  a  plane  surface, 
the  ratio  of  the  circumference  of  a  circle  to  its  diameter, 
both  lengths  being  measured*  with  the  same  rod,  is, 
according  to  Euclidean  geometry  of  the  plane,  equal  to 
a  constant  value  TT,  which  is  independent  of  the  diameter 
of  the  circle.  On  their  spherical  surface  our  flat  beings 
would  find  for  this  ratio  the  value 
i.e.  a  smaller  value  than  TT,  the  difference  being  the 
more  considerable,  the  greater  is  the  radius  of  the 
circle  in  comparison  with  the  radius  R  of  the  "  world- 
sphere*"  By  means  of  this  relation  the  spherical  beings 
can  determine  the  radius  of  their  universe  ("  world  "), 
even  when  only  a  relatively  small  part  of  their  world- 
sphere  is  available  for  their  measurements.  But  if  this 
part  is  very  small  indeed,  they  will  no  longer  be  able  to 
demonstrate  that  they  are  on  a  spherical  "  world  "  and 
not  on  a  Euclidean  plane,  for  a  small  part  of  a  spherical 
surface  differs  only  slightly  from  a  piece  of  a  plane  of 
the  same  size. 
Thus  if  the  spherical-surface  beings  are  living  on  a 
planet  of  which  the  solar  system  occupies  only  a  negligibly 
small  part  of  the  spherical  universe,  they  have  no  means 
of  determining  whether  they  are  living  in  a  finite  or  in 
an  innnite  universe,  because  the  "  piece  of  universe  " 
to  which  they  have  access  is  in  both  cases  practically 
plane,  or  Euclidean.  It  follows  directly  from  this 
discussion,  that  for  our  sphere-beings  the  circumference 
of  a  circle  first  increases  with  the  radius  until  the  "  cir-
