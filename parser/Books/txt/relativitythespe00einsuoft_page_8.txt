vi  RELATIVITY 
to  present  the  main  ideas  in  the  simplest  and  most  in 
telligible  form,  and  on  the  whole,  in  the  sequence  and  con 
nection  in  which  they  actually  originated.  In  the  interest 
of  clearness,  it  appeared  to  me  inevitable  that  I  should 
repeat  myself  frequently,  without  paying  the  slightest 
attention  to  the  elegance  of  the  presentation.  I  adhered 
scrupulously  to  the  precept  of  that  brilliant  theoretical 
physicist  L.  Boltzmann,  according  to  whom  matters  of 
elegance  ought  to  be  left  to  the  tailor  and  to  the  cobbler. 
I  make  no  pretence  of  having  withheld  from  the  reader 
difficulties  which  are  inherent  to  the  subject.  On  the 
other  hand,  I  have  purposely  treated  the  empirical 
physical  foundations  of  the  theory  in  a  "  step-motherly" 
fashion,  so  that  readers  unfamiliar  with  physics  may 
not  feel  like  the  wanderer  who  was  unable  to  see  the 
forest  for  trees.  May  the  book  bring  some  one  a  few 
happy  hours  of  suggestive  thought  !

NOTE  TO  THE  THIRD   EDITION 
IN  
the  present  year  (1918)  an  excellent  and  detailed 
manual^on  the  general  theory  of  relativity,  written 
by  H.    Weyl,    was   published   by  the  firm  Julius 
Springer  (Berlin).     This  book,  entitled   Raum — Zsit — 
Materie  (Space — Time — Matter),  may  be  warmly  recom 
mended  to  mathematicians  and  physicists.
