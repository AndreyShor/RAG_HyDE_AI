Law of refraction: A refracted ray lies in the plane of incidence and has an
angle of refraction u2 that is related to the angle of incidence u1 by
n2 sin u2 ! n1 sin u1
(refraction).
(33-40)
Here each of the symbols n1 and n2 is a dimensionless constant, called the index
of refraction, that is associated with a medium involved in the refraction. We
derive this equation, called Snell’s law, in Chapter 35. As we shall discuss there,
the index of refraction of a medium is equal to c/v, where v is the speed of light in
that medium and c is its speed in vacuum.
Table 33-1 gives the indexes of refraction of vacuum and some common
substances. For vacuum, n is defined to be exactly 1; for air, n is very close to 1.0 (an
approximation we shall often make).Nothing has an index of refraction below 1.
We can rearrange Eq. 33-40 as
(33-41)
to compare the angle of refraction u2 with the angle of incidence u1. We can
then see that the relative value of u2 depends on the relative values of n2 and n1:
1. If n2 is equal to n1, then u2 is equal to u1 and refraction does not bend the light
beam, which continues in the undeflected direction, as in Fig. 33-17a.

If the indexes match,
there is no direction
change.
If the next index is greater,
the ray is bent toward the
normal.
If the next index is less,
the ray is bent away from
the normal.
Figure 33-17 Refraction of light traveling from a medium with an index of refraction n1 into
a medium with an index of refraction n2. (a) The beam does not bend when n2 ! n1; the
refracted light then travels in the undeflected direction (the dotted line), which is the same
as the direction of the incident beam.The beam bends (b) toward the normal when n2 $ n1
and (c) away from the normal when n2 % n1.
