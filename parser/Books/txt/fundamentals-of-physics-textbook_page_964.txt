mF. (a) What is the resonant fre-
quency of the circuit? (Hint: See Problem 47 in Chapter 30.) What
happens to the resonant frequency if (b) R is increased, (c) L1 is in-
creased, and (d) C3 is removed from the circuit?
••50 An alternating emf source with a variable frequency fd is con-
nected in series with an 80.0 " resistor and a 40.0 mH inductor.The
emf amplitude is 6.00 V. (a) Draw a phasor diagram for phasor VR
(the potential across the resistor) and phasor VL (the potential
across the inductor). (b) At what driving frequency fd do the two
phasors have the same length? At that driving frequency, what are
(c) the phase angle in degrees, (d) the angular speed at which the
phasors rotate, and (e) the current amplitude?
••51
The fractional half-width )vd of a resonance curve,
such as the ones in Fig. 31-16, is the width of the curve at half the
maximum value of I. Show that )vd/v ! R(3C/L)1/2, where v is the
angular frequency at resonance. Note that the ratio )vd/v in-
creases with R, as Fig. 31-16 shows.

An ac voltmeter with large impedance is connected in turn
across the inductor, the capacitor, and the resistor in a series circuit
having an alternating emf of 100 V (rms); the meter gives the same
reading in volts in each case.What is this reading?
•53

equivalent to a 12.0 
resistance and a 1.30 
inductive reactance
in series. Calculate (a) the impedance of the air conditioner and
(b) the average rate at which energy is supplied to the appliance.
•54
What is the maximum value of an ac voltage whose rms value
is 100 V?

What direct current will produce the same amount of ther-
mal energy, in a particular resistor, as an alternating current that
has a maximum value of 2.60 A?

A typical light dimmer used to
dim the stage lights in a theater con-
sists of a variable inductor L (whose
inductance is adjustable between
zero and Lmax) connected in series
with a lightbulb B, as shown in
Fig. 31-34. The electrical supply is
120 V (rms) at 60.0 Hz; the lightbulb is rated at 120 V, 1000 W.
(a) What Lmax is required if the rate of energy dissipation in
the lightbulb is to be varied by a factor of 5 from its upper limit of
1000 W? Assume that the resistance of the lightbulb is indepen-
dent of its temperature. (b) Could one use a variable resistor
(adjustable between zero and Rmax) instead of an inductor? (c) If
so, what Rmax is required? (d) Why isn’t this done?

In an RLC circuit such as that of Fig. 31-7 assume that R !
5.00 ", L ! 60.0 mH, fd ! 60.0 Hz, and #m ! 30.0 V. For what val-
ues of the capacitance would the average rate at which energy is
dissipated in the resistance be (a) a maximum and (b) a minimum?

capacitive reactance XC, (b) the impedance Z, and (c) the current

Figure 31-32 shows a driven RLC circuit that contains two
identical capacitors and two switches. The emf amplitude is set at
12.0 V, and the driving frequency is set at 60.0 Hz. With both
switches open, the current leads the emf by 30.9°. With switch S1
closed and switch S2 still open, the emf leads the current by 15.0°.
With both switches closed, the current amplitude is 447 mA. What
