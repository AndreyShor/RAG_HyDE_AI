Position and Displacement
One general way of locating a particle (or particle-like object) is with a position
vector
, which is a vector that extends from a reference point (usually the 
origin) to the particle. In the unit-vector notation of Module 3-2,
can be written
(4-1)
where x , y , and z are the vector components of 
and the coefficients x, y, and z
are its scalar components.
The coefficients x, y, and z give the particle’s location along the coordinate
axes and relative to the origin; that is, the particle has the rectangular coordinates
(x, y, z). For instance, Fig. 4-1 shows a particle with position vector
and rectangular coordinates ($3 m, 2 m, 5 m). Along the x axis the particle is
3 m from the origin, in the 
direction. Along the y axis it is 2 m from the
origin, in the 
direction. Along the z axis it is 5 m from the origin, in the 
direction.
As a particle moves, its position vector changes in such a way that the vector
always extends to the particle from the reference point (the origin). If the posi-
tion vector changes—say, from 
to 
during a certain time interval—then the
particle’s displacement
during that time interval is
(4-2)
Using the unit-vector notation of Eq. 4-1, we can rewrite this displacement as
or as
(4-3)
where coordinates (x1, y1, z1) correspond to position vector 
and coordinates
(x2, y2, z2) correspond to position vector 
.We can also rewrite the displacement
by substituting x for (x2
x1),
y for (y2
y1), and z for (z2
z1):

Sample Problem 4.01 Two-dimensional position vector, rabbit run
A rabbit runs across a parking lot on which a set of
coordinate axes has, strangely enough, been drawn. The co-
ordinates (meters) of the rabbit’s position as functions of
time t (seconds) are given by
x " $0.31t2 # 7.2t # 28
(4-5)
and
y " 0.22t2 $ 9.1t # 30.
(4-6)
(a) At t " 15 s, what is the rabbit’s position vector 
in unit-
vector notation and in magnitude-angle notation?
KEY IDEA
The x and y coordinates of the rabbit’s position, as given by
Eqs. 4-5 and 4-6, are the scalar components of the rabbit’s
r:
Calculations: We can write

(We write 
rather than 
because the components are
functions of t, and thus 
is also.)
At t " 15 s, the scalar components are
