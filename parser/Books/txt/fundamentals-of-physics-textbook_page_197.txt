much like a stone skipped across water.The accompanying fireball
was so bright that it could be seen in the daytime sky and was
brighter than the usual meteorite trail. The meteorite’s mass was
about 4 ' 106 kg; its speed was about 15 km/s. Had it entered the
atmosphere vertically, it would have hit Earth’s surface with about
the same speed. (a) Calculate the meteorite’s loss of kinetic energy
(in joules) that would have been associated with the vertical impact.
(b) Express the energy as a multiple of the explosive energy of
1 megaton of TNT, which is 4.2 ' 1015 J. (c) The energy associated
with the atomic bomb explosion over Hiroshima was equivalent to
13 kilotons of TNT. To how many Hiroshima bombs would the me-
teorite impact have been equivalent?

An explosion at ground level leaves a crater with a diam-
eter that is proportional to the energy of the explosion raised to
the 
power; an explosion of 1 megaton of TNT leaves a crater
with a 1 km diameter. Below Lake Huron in Michigan there ap-
pears to be an ancient impact crater with a 50 km diameter. What
was the kinetic energy associated with that impact, in terms of
(a) megatons of TNT (1 megaton yields 4.2 ' 1015 J) and
(b) Hiroshima bomb equivalents (13 kilotons of TNT each)?
(Ancient meteorite or comet impacts may have significantly
altered the climate, killing off the dinosaurs and other life-forms.)

A father racing his son has half the kinetic energy of the son,
who has half the mass of the father.The father speeds up by 1.0 m/s
and then has the same kinetic energy as the son.What are the origi-
nal speeds of (a) the father and (b) the son?

A bead with mass 1.8 ' 10$2 kg is moving along a wire in
the positive direction of an x axis. Beginning at time t ! 0, when
the bead passes through x ! 0 with speed 12 m/s, a constant force
acts on the bead. Figure 7-24 indicates the bead’s position at
these four times: t0 ! 0, t1 ! 1.0 s, t2 ! 2.0 s, and t3 ! 3.0 s. The
bead momentarily stops at t ! 3.0 s. What is the kinetic energy of
the bead at t ! 10 s?

A coin slides over a frictionless plane and across an xy
coordinate system from the origin to a point with xy coordinates
(3.0 m, 4.0 m) while a constant force acts on it. The force has mag-
nitude 2.0 N and is directed at a counterclockwise angle of 100(
from the positive direction of the x axis. How much work is done
by the force on the coin during the displacement?

A 12.0 N force with a fixed orientation does work on a
particle as the particle moves through the three-dimensional dis-
placement

tween the force and the displacement if the change in the particle’s
kinetic energy is (a) "30.0 J and (b) $30.0 J?

A can of bolts and nuts is
pushed 2.00 m along an x axis by a
broom along the greasy (friction-
less) floor of a car repair shop in a
version of shuffleboard. Figure 7-26
gives the work W done on the can
by the constant horizontal force
from the broom, versus the can’s po-
sition x.The scale of the figure’s ver-
tical axis is set by Ws ! 6.0 J. (a)
What is the magnitude of that
force? (b) If the can had an initial kinetic energy of 3.00 J, moving
in the positive direction of the x axis, what is its kinetic energy at
the end of the 2.00 m?
••13 A luge and its rider, with a total mass of 85 kg, emerge from a
downhill track onto a horizontal straight track with an initial speed
of 37 m/s. If a force slows them to a stop at a constant rate of 2.0
m/s2, (a) what magnitude F is required for the force, (b) what dis-
tance d do they travel while slowing, and (c) what work W is done
on them by the force? What are (d) F, (e) d, and (f) W if they, in-
stead, slow at 4.0 m/s2?

Figure 7-27 shows an over-
head view of three horizontal forces
acting on a cargo canister that was
initially stationary but now moves
across a frictionless floor. The force
magnitudes are F1 ! 3.00 N, F2 !
4.00 N, and F3 ! 10.0 N, and the indi-
cated angles are u2 ! 50.0( and u3 !
35.0(. What is the net work done on
the canister by the three forces dur-
ing the first 4.00 m of displacement?

Figure 7-28 shows three
forces applied to a trunk that moves
leftward by 3.00 m over a friction-
less floor. The force magnitudes are
F1 ! 5.00 N, F2 ! 9.00 N, and F3 !
3.00 N, and the indicated angle is u !
60.0(.

the 
displacement,
(a) what is the net work done on the
trunk by the three forces and (b)
does the kinetic energy of the trunk
increase or decrease?

A 3.0 kg body is at rest on a frictionless horizontal air track
when a constant horizontal force 
acting in the positive direction of
an x axis along the track is applied to the body.A stroboscopic graph
of the position of the body as it slides to the right is shown in Fig. 7-

is applied to the body at t ! 0, and the graph records
the position of the body at 0.50 s intervals. How much work is done
