30-8 ENERGY DENSITY OF A MAGNETIC FIELD
Energy Density of a Magnetic Field
Consider a length l near the middle of a long solenoid of cross-sectional area A
carrying current i; the volume associated with this length is Al. The energy UB
stored by the length l of the solenoid must lie entirely within this volume because
the magnetic field outside such a solenoid is approximately zero. Moreover,
the stored energy must be uniformly distributed within the solenoid because the
magnetic field is (approximately) uniform everywhere inside.
Thus, the energy stored per unit volume of the field is
or, since
we have
(30-53)
Here L is the inductance of length l of the solenoid.
Substituting for L/l from Eq. 30-31, we find
(30-54)
where n is the number of turns per unit length. From Eq. 29-23 (B ! m0in) we can
write this energy density as
(magnetic energy density).
(30-55)
This equation gives the density of stored energy at any point where the magni-
tude of the magnetic field is B. Even though we derived it by considering the
special case of a solenoid, Eq. 30-55 holds for all magnetic fields, no matter how
they are generated.The equation is comparable to Eq. 25-25,
(30-56)
which gives the energy density (in a vacuum) at any point in an electric field.
Note that both uB and uE are proportional to the square of the appropriate field
magnitude, B or E.
