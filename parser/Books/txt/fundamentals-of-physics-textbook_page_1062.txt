IMAGES
Real and Virtual Images
An image is a reproduction of an
object via light. If the image can form on a surface, it is a real image
and can exist even if no observer is present. If the image requires
the visual system of an observer, it is a virtual image.
Image Formation
Spherical mirrors, spherical refracting sur-
faces, and thin lenses can form images of a source of light—the
object—by redirecting rays emerging from the source. The image
occurs where the redirected rays cross (forming a real image) or
where backward extensions of those rays cross (forming a virtual
image). If the rays are sufficiently close to the central axis through
the spherical mirror, refracting surface, or thin lens, we have the
following relations between the object distance p (which is posi-
tive) and the image distance i (which is positive for real images and
negative for virtual images):
1. Spherical Mirror:
(34-4, 34-3)
where f is the mirror’s focal length and r is its radius of curvature.
A plane mirror is a special case for which r : 1, so that p ! &i.
Real images form on the side of a mirror where the object is
located, and virtual images form on the opposite side.
2. Spherical Refracting Surface:
(single surface),
(34-8)
where n1 is the index of refraction of the material where the object
is located, n2 is the index of refraction of the material on the other
side of the refracting surface, and r is the radius of curvature of the
surface. When the object faces a convex refracting surface, the ra-
dius r is positive.When it faces a concave surface, r is negative. Real
images form on the side of a refracting surface that is opposite the
object, and virtual images form on the same side as the object.
3. Thin Lens:
(34-9, 34-10)
where f is the lens’s focal length, n is the index of refraction of the
lens material,and r1 and r2 are the radii of curvature of the two sides
of the lens, which are spherical surfaces. A convex lens surface that

Review & Summary
faces the object has a positive radius of curvature; a concave lens
surface that faces the object has a negative radius of curvature. Real
images form on the side of a lens that is opposite the object, and vir-
tual images form on the same side as the object.
Lateral Magnification
The lateral magnification m produced
by a spherical mirror or a thin lens is
(34-6)
The magnitude of m is given by
(34-5)
where h and h# are the heights (measured perpendicular to the
central axis) of the object and image, respectively.
Optical Instruments
Three optical instruments that extend
human vision are:
1. The simple magnifying lens, which produces an angular magni-
fication mu given by
(34-12)
where f is the focal length of the magnifying lens. The distance
of 25 cm is a traditionally chosen value that is a bit more than
the typical near point for someone 20 years old.
2. The compound microscope, which produces an overall magnifi-
cation M given by
(34-14)
where m is the lateral magnification produced by the objective,
mu is the angular magnification produced by the eyepiece, s is
the tube length, and fob and fey are the focal lengths of the objec-
tive and eyepiece, respectively.
3. The refracting telescope, which produces an angular magnifica-
tion mu given by

Adding Eqs. 34-22 and 34-25 leads to
Finally, calling the original object distance simply p and the final image distance
simply i leads to
(34-26)
which, with a small change in notation, is Eqs. 34-9 and 34-10.
