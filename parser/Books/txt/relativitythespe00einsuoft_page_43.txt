THE  RELATIVITY  OF  SIMULTANEITY 
UP  
to  now  our  considerations  have  been  referred 
to  a   particular   body  of   reference,   which   we 
have   styled   a    "  railway    embankment."     We 
suppose  a   very  long  train  travelling  along  the  rails 
with  the  constant  velocity  v  and  in  the  direction  in 
dicated  in  Fig.  i.     People  travelling  in  this  train  will 
with  advantage   use  the  train  as  a  rigid  reference- 
body  (co-ordinate  system) ;   they  regard  all  events  in

reference  to  the  train.  Then  every  event  which  takes 
place  along  the  line  also  takes  place  at  a  particular 
point  of  the  train.  Also  the  definition  of  simultaneity 
can  be  given  relative  to  the  train  in  exactly  the  same 
way  as  with  respect  to  the  embankment.  As  a  natural 
consequence,  however,  the  following  question  arises  : 
Are  two  events  (e.g.  the  two  strokes  of  lightning  A 
and  B)  which  are  simultaneous  with  reference  to  the 
railway  embankment  also  simultaneous  relatively  to  the 
train  ?  We  shall  show  directly  that  the  answer  must 
be  in  the  negative. 
When  we  say  that  the  lightning  strokes  A  and  B  are
