A trigonometry theorem that is useful here tells us that an exterior angle of a
triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles. Applying this to
triangles OaC and OaI in Fig. 34-22 yields
b ! a ' u
and
g ! a ' 2u.
If we eliminate u between these two equations, we find
a ' g ! 2b.
(34-16)
We can write angles a, b, and g, in radian measure, as
and
(34-17)
where the overhead symbol means “arc.” Only the equation for b is exact, because
the center of curvature of
is at C. However, the equations for a and g are
approximately correct if these angles are small enough (that is, for rays close to the
central axis). Substituting Eqs. 34-17 into Eq. 34-16, using Eq. 34-3 to replace r with
2f,and canceling
lead exactly to Eq.34-4,the relation that we set out to prove.
The Refracting Surface Formula (Eq. 34-8)
The incident ray from point object O in Fig. 34-23 that falls on point a of a spheri-
cal refracting surface is refracted there according to Eq. 33-40,
n1 sin u1 ! n2 sin u2.
If a is small, u1 and u2 will also be small and we can replace the sines of these
angles with the angles themselves. Thus, the equation above becomes
n1u1 % n2u2.
(34-18)
We again use the fact that an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the
two opposite interior angles.Applying this to triangles COa and ICa yields
u1 ! a ' b
and
b ! u2 ' g.
(34-19)
If we use Eqs. 34-19 to eliminate u1 and u2 from Eq. 34-18, we find
n1a ' n2g ! (n2 & n1)b.
(34-20)
In radian measure the angles a, b, and g are
(34-21)
Only the second of these equations is exact. The other two are approximate
because I and O are not the centers of circles of which 
is a part. However, for
a small enough (for rays close to the axis), the inaccuracies in Eqs. 34-21 are small.
Substituting Eqs.34-21 into Eq.34-20 leads directly to Eq.34-8,as we wanted.
The Thin-Lens Formulas (Eqs. 34-9 and 34-10)
Our plan is to consider each lens surface as a separate refracting surface, and to
use the image formed by the first surface as the object for the second.
We start with the thick glass “lens” of length L in Fig. 34-24a whose left and
right refracting surfaces are ground to radii r# and r-.A point object O# is placed
near the left surface as shown. A ray leaving O# along the central axis is not
deflected on entering or leaving the lens.
A second ray leaving O# at an angle a with the central axis intersects the left
surface at point a#, is refracted, and intersects the second (right) surface at point a-.
