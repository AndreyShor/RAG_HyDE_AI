Diffraction Gratings

Perhaps to confuse a predator, some tropical gyrinid
beetles (whirligig beetles) are colored by optical interference that
is due to scales whose alignment forms a diffraction grating (which
scatters light instead of transmitting it). When the incident light
rays are perpendicular to the grating, the angle between the first-
order maxima (on opposite sides of the zeroth-order maximum) is
about 26° in light with a wavelength of 550 nm.What is the grating
spacing of the beetle?
•45
A diffraction grating 20.0 mm wide has 6000 rulings. Light of
wavelength 589 nm is incident perpendicularly on the grating.
What are the (a) largest, (b) second largest, and (c) third largest
values of u at which maxima appear on a distant viewing screen?
•46
Visible light is incident perpendicularly on a grating with 315
rulings/mm.What is the longest wavelength that can be seen in the
fifth-order diffraction?
•47
A grating has 400 lines/mm. How many orders of
the entire visible spectrum (400–700 nm) can it produce in a dif-
fraction experiment, in addition to the m ! 0 order?
••48
A diffraction grating is made up of slits of width 300 nm with
separation 900 nm. The grating is illuminated by monochromatic
plane waves of wavelength l ! 600 nm at normal incidence.
(a) How many maxima are there in the full diffraction pattern?
(b) What is the angular width of a spectral line observed in the first
order if the grating has 1000 slits?
••49
Light of wavelength 600 nm is incident normally
on a diffraction grating. Two adjacent maxima occur at angles given
by sin u ! 0.2 and sin u ! 0.3.The fourth-order maxima are missing.
(a) What is the separation between adjacent slits? (b) What is the
smallest slit width this grating can have? For that slit width, what are
the (c) largest, (d) second largest, and (e) third largest values of the
order number m of the maxima produced by the grating?
••50
With light from a gaseous discharge tube incident normally
on a grating with slit separation 1.73 mm, sharp maxima of green
light are experimentally found at angles u ! ,17.6°, 37.3°, &37.1°,
65.2°, and &65.0°. Compute the wavelength of the green light that
best fits these data.
••51
A diffraction grating having 180 lines/mm is illuminated
with a light signal containing only two wavelengths, l1
400 nm
and l2 ! 500 nm. The signal is incident perpendicularly on the
grating. (a) What is the angular separation between the second-
order maxima of these two wavelengths? (b) What is the smallest
angle at which two of the resulting maxima are superimposed?
(c) What is the highest order for which maxima for both wave-
lengths are present in the diffraction pattern?
••52
A beam of light consisting of wavelengths from
460.0 nm to 640.0 nm is directed perpendicularly onto a diffrac-
tion grating with 160 lines/mm. (a) What is the lowest order that is
overlapped by another order? (b) What is the highest order for
which the complete wavelength range of the beam is present? In
that highest order, at what angle does the light at wavelength (c)
460.0 nm and (d) 640.0 nm appear? (e) What is the greatest angle
at which the light at wavelength 460.0 nm appears?

complete bright fringes appear between the two first-order minima
of the diffraction pattern?
•37
In a double-slit experiment, the slit separation d is 2.00 times
the slit width w. How many bright interference fringes are in the
central diffraction envelope?
•38
In a certain two-slit interference pattern, 10 bright fringes lie
within the second side peak of the diffraction envelope and diffrac-
tion minima coincide with two-slit interference maxima. What is
the ratio of the slit separation to the slit width?
••39
Light of wavelength 440 nm passes through a double slit,
yielding a diffraction pattern whose graph of intensity I versus an-
gular position u is shown in Fig. 36-44. Calculate (a) the slit width
and (b) the slit separation. (c) Verify the displayed intensities of
the m ! 1 and m ! 2 interference fringes.

Figure 36-45 gives the pa-
rameter b of Eq. 36-20 versus the
sine of the angle u in a two-slit inter-
ference experiment using light of
wavelength 435 nm.The vertical axis
scale is set by bs ! 80.0 rad.What are
(a) the slit separation, (b) the total
number of interference maxima
(count them on both sides of the
pattern’s center), (c) the smallest angle for a maxima, and (d) the
greatest angle for a minimum? Assume that none of the interference
maxima are completely eliminated by a diffraction minimum.

In the two-slit interference experiment of Fig. 35-10, the slit
widths are each 12.0 mm,their separation is 24.0 mm,the wavelength is
600 nm,and the viewing screen is at a distance of 4.00 m.Let IP repre-
sent the intensity at point P on the screen, at height y ! 70.0 cm. (a)
What is the ratio of IP to the intensity Im at the center of the pattern?
(b) Determine where P is in the two-slit interference pattern by giving
the maximum or minimum on which it lies or the maximum and mini-
mum between which it lies.(c) In the same way,for the diffraction that
occurs,determine where point P is in the diffraction pattern.

(a) In a double-slit experiment, what largest ratio of d to a

that bright fringe?
