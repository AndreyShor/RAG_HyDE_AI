gas at a temperature of 7 ' 108 K. If this gas could be used to oper-
ate a Carnot engine with TL # 100 C, what would be the engine’s

In the first stage of a two-stage Carnot engine, energy is ab-
sorbed as heat Q1 at temperature T1, work W1 is done, and energy
is expelled as heat Q2 at a lower temperature T2. The second stage
absorbs that energy as heat Q2, does work W2, and expels energy as
heat Q3 at a still lower temperature T3. Prove that the efficiency of

A 2.0 mol sample of an
ideal monatomic gas undergoes
the
reversible process shown in 
Fig. 20-26. The scale of the vertical

scale of the horizontal axis is set by
Ss # 20.0 J/K. (a) How much energy
is absorbed as heat by the gas?

Suppose 1.00 mol of a monatomic ideal gas is taken from ini-
tial pressure p1 and volume V1 through two steps: (1) an isothermal
expansion to volume 2.00V1 and (2) a pressure increase to 2.00p1 at
constant volume.What is Q/p1V1 for (a) step 1 and (b) step 2? What
is W/p1V1 for (c) step 1 and (d) step 2? For the full process, what are
(e) %Eint/p1V1 and (f) %S? The gas is returned to its initial state and
again taken to the same final state but now through these two steps:
(1) an isothermal compression to pressure 2.00p1 and (2) a volume
increase to 2.00V1 at constant pressure.What is Q/p1V1 for (g) step 1
and (h) step 2? What is W/p1V1 for (i) step 1 and (j) step 2? For the
full process,what are (k) %Eint/p1V1 and (l) %S?

Expand 1.00 mol of an monatomic gas initially at 5.00 kPa
and 600 K from initial volume Vi # 1.00 m3 to final volume Vf #
2.00 m3.At any instant during the expansion, the pressure p and vol-
ume V of the gas are related by p # 5.00 exp[(Vi $ V)/a], with p in
kilopascals, Vi and V in cubic meters, and a # 1.00 m3. What are the
final (a) pressure and (b) temperature of the gas? (c) How much

Energy can be removed from water as heat at
and even below the normal freezing point (0.0 C at atmospheric
pressure) without causing the water to freeze; the water is then
said to be supercooled. Suppose a 1.00 g water drop is super-
cooled until its temperature is that of the surrounding air, which
is at $5.00-C. The drop then suddenly and irreversibly freezes,
transferring energy to the air as heat.What is the entropy change
for the drop? (Hint: Use a three-step reversible process as if the
water were taken through the normal freezing point.) The spe-
cific heat of ice is 2220 J/kg9K.
