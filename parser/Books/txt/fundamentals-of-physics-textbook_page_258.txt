CHAPTER 9
CENTER OF MASS AND LINEAR MOMENTUM
Calculations: Linear momentum is also conserved along
the x axis because there is no net external force acting on
the coconut and pieces along that axis.Thus we have
Pix ! Pfx,
(9-49)
where Pix ! 0 because the coconut is initially at rest. To
get Pfx, we find the x components of the final momenta,
using the fact that piece A must have a mass of 0.50M
(! M % 0.20M % 0.30M):
pfA,x ! %0.50MvfA,
pfB,x ! 0.20MvfB,x ! 0.20MvfB cos 50#,
pfC,x ! 0.30MvfC,x ! 0.30MvfC cos 80#.
Equation 9-49 for the conservation of momentum along the
x axis can now be written as
Pix ! Pfx ! pfA,x & pfB,x & pfC,x.
Then, with vfC ! 5.0 m/s and vfB ! 9.64 m/s, we have
0 ! %0.50MvfA & 0.20M(9.64 m/s) cos 50#
& 0.30M(5.0 m/s) cos 80#,
from which we find
vfA ! 3.0 m/s.

Sample Problem 9.06
Two-dimensional explosion, momentum, coconut
Two-dimensional explosion: A firecracker placed inside a
coconut of mass M, initially at rest on a frictionless floor,
blows the coconut into three pieces that slide across the floor.
An overhead view is shown in Fig. 9-13a. Piece C, with mass
0.30M,has final speed vfC ! 5.0 m/s.
(a) What is the speed of piece B, with mass 0.20M?
KEY IDEA
First we need to see whether linear momentum is con-
served. We note that (1) the coconut and its pieces form a
closed system, (2) the explosion forces are internal to that
system, and (3) no net external force acts on the system.
Therefore, the linear momentum of the system is conserved.
(We need to be careful here: Although the momentum of
the system does not change, the momenta of the pieces cer-
tainly do.)
Calculations: To get started,we superimpose an xy coordinate
system as shown in Fig.9-13b,with the negative direction of the
x axis coinciding with the direction of

.
Linear momentum is conserved separately along each
axis. Let’s use the y axis and write
Piy ! Pfy,
(9-48)
where subscript i refers to the initial value (before the ex-
plosion), and subscript y refers to the y component of 
or 
.
The component Piy of the initial linear momentum is
zero, because the coconut is initially at rest. To get an ex-
pression for Pfy, we find the y component of the final linear
momentum of each piece, using the y-component version of
Eq. 9-22 (py ! mvy):
pfA,y ! 0,
pfB,y ! %0.20MvfB,y ! %0.20MvfB sin 50#,
pfC,y ! 0.30MvfC,y ! 0.30MvfC sin 80#.
(Note that pfA,y ! 0 because of our nice choice of axes.)
Equation 9-48 can now be written as
Piy ! Pfy ! pfA,y & pfB,y & pfC,y.
Then, with vfC ! 5.0 m/s, we have
0 ! 0 % 0.20MvfB sin 50# & (0.30M)(5.0 m/s) sin 80#,
from which we find
vfB ! 9.64 m/s % 9.6 m/s.

can change the momentum
