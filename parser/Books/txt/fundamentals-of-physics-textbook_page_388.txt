GRAVITATION
13-4 GRAVITATION INSIDE EARTH
Learning Objectives
13.10 Calculate the gravitational force that is exerted on a
particle at a given radius inside a nonrotating uniform
sphere of matter.
●A uniform shell of matter exerts no net gravitational force on
a particle located inside it.
●The gravitational force 
on a particle inside a uniform
solid sphere, at a distance r from the center, is due only to
mass Mins in an “inside sphere” with that radius r:

:
where r is the solid sphere’s density, R is its radius, and M is
its mass. We can assign this inside mass to be that of a parti-
cle at the center of the solid sphere and then apply Newton’s
law of gravitation for particles. We find that the magnitude of
the force acting on mass m is

gravitational force on a particle located inside it.
Key Ideas
where the ME value is taken from Appendix C. This result
means that the gravitational acceleration of the astronaut’s
feet toward Earth is slightly greater than the gravitational
acceleration of her head toward Earth. This difference in
acceleration (often called a tidal effect) tends to stretch her
body, but the difference is so small that she would never even
sense the stretching,much less suffer pain from it.
(b) If the astronaut is now “feet down” at the same orbital
radius r ! 6.77 $ 106 m about a black hole of mass Mh !
1.99 $ 1031 kg (10 times our Sun’s mass), what is the dif-
ference between the gravitational acceleration at her feet
and at her head? The black hole has a mathematical sur-
face (event horizon) of radius Rh ! 2.95 $ 104 m. Nothing,
not even light, can escape from that surface or anywhere
inside it. Note that the astronaut is well outside the sur-
face (at r ! 229Rh).
Calculations: We again have a differential change dr in r
between the astronaut’s feet and head, so we can again use
Eq. 13-16. However, now we substitute Mh ! 1.99 $ 1031 kg
for ME.We find
! %14.5 m/s2.
(Answer)
This means that the gravitational acceleration of the astro-
naut’s feet toward the black hole is noticeably larger than
that of her head.The resulting tendency to stretch her body
would be bearable but quite painful. If she drifted closer 
to the black hole, the stretching tendency would increase
drastically.

Sample Problem 13.02
Difference in acceleration at head and feet
(a) An astronaut whose height h is 1.70 m floats “feet down”
in an orbiting space shuttle at distance r ! 6.77 $ 106 m away
from the center of Earth.What is the difference between the
gravitational acceleration at her feet and at her head?
KEY IDEAS
We can approximate Earth as a uniform sphere of mass ME.
Then,from Eq.13-11,the gravitational acceleration at any dis-
tance r from the center of Earth is
(13-15)
We might simply apply this equation twice, first with r
6.77 $ 106 m for the location of the feet and then with 
r ! 6.77 $ 106 m # 1.70 m for the location of the head.
However, a calculator may give us the same value for ag twice,
and thus a difference of zero, because h is so much smaller
than r. Here’s a more promising approach: Because we have
a differential change dr in r between the astronaut’s feet and
head, we should differentiate Eq. 13-15 with respect to r.
Calculations: The differentiation gives us
(13-16)
where dag is the differential change in the gravitational 
acceleration due to the differential change dr in r. For the
astronaut, dr ! h and r ! 6.77 $ 106 m. Substituting data
into Eq. 13-16, we find
