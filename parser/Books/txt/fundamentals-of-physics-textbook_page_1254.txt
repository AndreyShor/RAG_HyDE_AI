of many electrons, each with a spin magnetic moment and an orbital magnetic
moment.We also know that all those moments vectorially cancel out except for a
single electron, and the orbital dipole moment of that electron is zero. Thus, the
combined dipole moment 
of a silver atom is the spin magnetic dipole moment
of that single electron. According to Eq. 40-13, this means that mz can have only
two components along the z axis in Fig. 40-8. One component is for quantum
number 
(the single electron is spin up), and the other component is for
quantum number 
(the single electron is spin down). Substituting into
Eq. 40-13 gives us
.
(40-18)
Then substituting these expressions for mz in Eq.40-17,we find that the force compo-
nent Fz deflecting the silver atoms as they pass through the magnetic field can have
only the two values
(40-19)
which result in the two spots of silver on the glass. Although no one knew about
spin at the time, the Stern–Gerlach results were actually the first experimental
evidence of electron spin.

CHAPTER 40
ALL ABOUT ATOMS
Because this acceleration is constant, we can use Eq. 2-15
(from Table 2-1) to write the deflection d parallel to the
z axis as
(40-20)
Because the deflecting force on the atom acts perpendi-
cular to the atom’s original direction of travel, the compo-
nent v of the atom’s velocity along the original direction of
travel is not changed by the force. Thus, the atom requires
time t ! w/v to travel through length w in that direction.
Substituting w/v for t into Eq. 40-20, we find

The separation between the two subbeams is twice this, or
0.16 mm.This separation is not large but is easily measured.

Sample Problem 40.01
Beam separation in a Stern–Gerlach experiment
In the Stern–Gerlach experiment of Fig. 40-8, a beam of
silver atoms passes through a magnetic field gradient
dB/dz of magnitude 1.4 T/mm that is set up along the z
axis.This region has a length w of 3.5 cm in the direction of
the original beam. The speed of the atoms is 750 m/s. By
what distance d have the atoms been deflected when they
leave the region of the field gradient? The mass M of a sil-
ver atom is 1.8 " 10 225 kg.
KEY IDEAS
(1) The deflection of a silver atom in the beam is due to an
interaction between the magnetic dipole of the atom and
the magnetic field, because of the gradient dB/dz. The
deflecting force is directed along the field gradient (along
the z axis) and is given by Eqs. 40-19. Let us consider only
deflection in the positive direction of z; thus, we shall use 
Fz ! mB(dB/dz) from Eqs. 40-19.
(2) We assume the field gradient dB/dz has the same value
throughout the region through which the silver atoms travel.
Thus, force component Fz is constant in that region, and from
Newton’s second law, the acceleration az of an atom along the
z axis due to Fz is also constant.
Calculations: Putting these ideas together, we write the 
acceleration as
