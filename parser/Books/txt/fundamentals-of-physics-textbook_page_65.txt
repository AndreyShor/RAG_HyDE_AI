from a height of h. (a) What is its speed just before it strikes the

as in (a) and (b).

A motorcycle is moving at 30 m/s when the rider applies the
brakes,giving the motorcycle a constant deceleration.During the 3.0 s
interval immediately after braking begins, the speed decreases to
15 m/s. What distance does the motorcycle travel from the instant
braking begins until the motorcycle stops?

A shuffleboard disk is accelerated at a constant rate from rest
to a speed of 6.0 m/s over a 1.8 m distance by a player using a cue.At
this point the disk loses contact with the cue and slows at a constant
rate of 2.5 m/s2 until it stops. (a) How much time elapses from when
the disk begins to accelerate until it stops? (b) What total distance
does the disk travel?
107
The head of a rattlesnake can accelerate at 50 m/s2 in striking
a victim. If a car could do as well, how long would it take to reach a
speed of 100 km/h from rest?

A jumbo jet must reach a speed of 360 km/h on the runway
for takeoff. What is the lowest constant acceleration needed for
takeoff from a 1.80 km runway?
109
An automobile driver increases the speed at a constant rate
from 25 km/h to 55 km/h in 0.50 min. A bicycle rider speeds up at a
constant rate from rest to 30 km/h in 0.50 min. What are the magni-
tudes of (a) the driver’s acceleration and (b) the rider’s acceleration?

On average, an eye blink lasts about 100 ms. How far does a
MiG-25 “Foxbat” fighter travel during a pilot’s blink if the plane’s
average velocity is 3400 km/h?
111
A certain sprinter has a top speed of 11.0 m/s. If the sprinter
starts from rest and accelerates at a constant rate, he is able to
reach his top speed in a distance of 12.0 m. He is then able to main-
tain this top speed for the remainder of a 100 m race. (a) What is
his time for the 100 m race? (b) In order to improve his time, the
sprinter tries to decrease the distance required for him to reach his
x " 50t # 10t2
top speed. What must this distance be if he is to achieve a time of
10.0 s for the race?
112
The speed of a bullet is measured to be 640 m/s as the bullet
emerges from a barrel of length 1.20 m.Assuming constant accelera-
tion, find the time that the bullet spends in the barrel after it is fired.

The Zero Gravity Research Facility at the NASA Glenn
Research Center includes a 145 m drop tower.This is an evacuated ver-
tical tower through which, among other possibilities, a 1-m-diameter
sphere containing an experimental package can be dropped. (a)
How long is the sphere in free fall? (b) What is its speed just as it
reaches a catching device at the bottom of the tower? (c) When
caught, the sphere experiences an average deceleration of 25g as its
speed is reduced to zero.Through what distance does it travel during
the deceleration?

A car can be braked to a stop from the autobahn-like
speed of 200 km/h in 170 m. Assuming the acceleration is constant,
find its magnitude in (a) SI units and (b) in terms of g.(c) How much
time Tb is required for the braking? Your reaction time Tr is the time
you require to perceive an emergency, move your foot to the brake,
and begin the braking. If Tr " 400 ms, then (d) what is Tb in terms of
Tr, and (e) is most of the full time required to stop spent in reacting
or braking? Dark sunglasses delay the visual signals sent from the
eyes to the visual cortex in the brain,increasing Tr.(f) In the extreme
case in which Tr is increased by 100 ms, how much farther does
the car travel during your reaction time?

In 1889, at Jubbulpore, India, a tug-of-war was finally won af-

the average velocity of that center point during the contest?

Most important in an investigation of an airplane crash by the
U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is the data stored on the
airplane’s flight-data recorder, commonly called the “black box” in
spite of its orange coloring and reflective tape.The recorder is engi-
neered to withstand a crash with an average deceleration of magni-
tude 3400g during a time interval of 6.50 ms. In such a crash, if the
recorder and airplane have zero speed at the end of that time inter-
val,what is their speed at the beginning of the interval?

Meegan of Great Britain walked from Ushuaia, at the southern tip
of South America, to Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, covering 30 600 km. In
meters per second, what was the magnitude of his average velocity
during that time period?

The wings on a stonefly do not flap,and thus the insect cannot
fly. However, when the insect is on a water surface, it can sail across
the surface by lifting its wings into a breeze. Suppose that you time
stoneflies as they move at constant speed along a straight path of a
certain length. On average, the trips each take 7.1 s with the wings
set as sails and 25.0 s with the wings tucked in.(a) What is the ratio of
the sailing speed vs to the nonsailing speed vns? (b) In terms of vs,
what is the difference in the times the insects take to travel the first
2.0 m along the path with and without sailing?
