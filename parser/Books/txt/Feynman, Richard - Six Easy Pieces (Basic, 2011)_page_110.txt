Take now the somewhat more complicated example shown in
Fig. 4-6. A rod or bar, 8 feet long, is supported at one end. In the
middle of the bar is a weight of 60 pounds, and at a distance of
two feet from the support there is a weight of 100 pounds. How
hard do we have to lift the end of the bar in order to keep it bal-
anced, disregarding the weight of the bar? Suppose we put a pulley
at one end and hang a weight on the pulley. How big would the
weight W have to be in order for it to balance? We imagine that
the weight falls any arbitrary distance—to make it easy for our-
selves suppose it goes down 4 inches—how high would the two
load weights rise? The center rises 2 inches, and the point a quar-
ter of the way from the ﬁxed end lifts 1 inch. Therefore, the prin-
ciple that the sum of the heights times the weights does not
change tells us that the weight W times 4 inches down, plus 60
pounds times 2 inches up, plus 100 pounds times 1 inch, has to
add up to nothing:
(4.5)
Thus we must have a 55-pound weight to balance the bar. In this
way we can work out the laws of “balance”—the statics of compli-
cated bridge arrangements, and so on. This approach is called the
principle of virtual work, because in order to apply this argument
we had to imagine that the structure moves a little—even though
