OSCILLATIONS
The constant k, which is a property of the wire, is the same for
both figures;only the periods and the rotational inertias differ.
Let us square each of these equations, divide the second
by the first,and solve the resulting equation for Ib.The result is

Sample Problem 15.04
Angular simple harmonic oscillator, rotational inertia, period
Figure 15-10a shows a thin rod whose length L is 12.4 cm and
whose mass m is 135 g, suspended at its midpoint from a long
wire. Its period Ta of angular SHM is measured to be 2.53 s.
An irregularly shaped object, which we call object X, is then
hung from the same wire, as in Fig. 15-10b, and its period Tb is
found to be 4.76 s. What is the rotational inertia of object X
about its suspension axis?
KEY IDEA
The rotational inertia of either the rod or object X is related
to the measured period by Eq. 15-23.
Calculations: In Table 10-2e, the rotational inertia of a thin
rod about a perpendicular axis through its midpoint is given as
mL2.Thus,we have,for the rod in Fig.15-10a,
Ia !
mL2 ! ( )(0.135 kg)(0.124 m)2
! 1.73 $ 10%4 kg"m2.
Now let us write Eq. 15-23 twice, once for the rod and once
for object X:

15-4 PENDULUMS, CIRCULAR MOTION
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
15.27 Describe the motion of an oscillating simple pendulum.
15.28 Draw a free-body diagram of a pendulum bob with the
pendulum at angle u to the vertical.
15.29 For small-angle oscillations of a simple pendulum, relate
the period T (or frequency f) to the pendulum’s length L.
15.30 Distinguish between a simple pendulum and a physical
pendulum.
15.31 For small-angle oscillations of a physical pendulum, re-
late the period T (or frequency f) to the distance h be-
tween the pivot and the center of mass.
15.32 For an angular oscillating system, determine the angu-
lar frequency v from either an equation relating torque t
and angular displacement u or an equation relating angular
acceleration a and angular displacement u.
15.33 Distinguish between a pendulum’s angular frequency
v (having to do with the rate at which cycles are com-
pleted) and its du/dt (the rate at which its angle with the
vertical changes).
15.34 Given data about the angular position u and rate of
change du/dt at one instant, determine the phase constant f
and amplitude um.
15.35 Describe how the free-fall acceleration can be mea-
sured with a simple pendulum.
15.36 For a given physical pendulum, determine the location
of the center of oscillation and identify the meaning of that
phrase in terms of a simple pendulum.
15.37 Describe how simple harmonic motion is related to uni-
form circular motion.

k of Eq. 15-22, and we replace the mass m in Eq. 15-13 with its equivalent, the
rotational inertia I of the oscillating disk.These replacements lead to
