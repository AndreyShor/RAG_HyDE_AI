Light as a Wave
•1
In Fig. 35-31, a light wave along
ray r1 reflects once from a mirror and
a light wave along ray r2 reflects twice
from that same mirror and once from
a tiny mirror at distance L from the
bigger mirror. (Neglect the slight tilt
of the rays.) The waves have wave-
length 620 nm and are initially in phase. (a) What is the smallest value
of L that puts the final light waves exactly out of phase? (b) With the
tiny mirror initially at that value of L, how far must it be moved away
from the bigger mirror to again put the final waves out of phase?
•2
In Fig. 35-31, a light wave along ray r1 reflects once from a
mirror and a light wave along ray r2 reflects twice from that same
mirror and once from a tiny mirror at distance L from the bigger
mirror. (Neglect the slight tilt of the rays.) The waves have wave-
length l and are initially exactly out of phase. What are the
(a) smallest, (b) second smallest, and (c) third smallest values of
L/l that result in the final waves being exactly in phase?
•3
In Fig. 35-4, assume that two waves of light in air, of
wavelength 400 nm,are initially in phase.One travels through a glass
layer of index of refraction n1 ! 1.60 and thickness L. The other
travels through an equally thick plastic layer of index of refraction
n2 ! 1.50. (a) What is the smallest value L should have if the waves
are to end up with a phase difference of 5.65 rad? (b) If the waves
arrive at some common point with the same amplitude,is their inter-
ference fully constructive, fully destructive, intermediate but closer
to fully constructive, or intermediate but closer to fully destructive?

In Fig. 35-32a, a beam of light in material 1 is incident on a
boundary at an angle of 30°. The extent to which the light is bent
due to refraction depends, in part, on the index of refraction n2 of
material 2. Figure 35-32b gives the angle of refraction u2 versus n2
for a range of possible n2 values, from na ! 1.30 to nb ! 1.90.What
is the speed of light in material 1?
