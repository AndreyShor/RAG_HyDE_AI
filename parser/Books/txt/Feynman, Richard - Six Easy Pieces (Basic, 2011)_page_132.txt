This discovery shows that Newton’s laws are absolutely right in
the solar system, but do they extend beyond the relatively small dis-
tances of the nearest planets? The ﬁrst test lies in the question, do
stars attract each other as well as planets? We have deﬁnite evidence
that they do in the double stars. Figure 5-6 shows a double star—
two stars very close together (there is also a third star in the picture
so that we will know that the photograph was not turned). The
stars are also shown as they appeared several years later. We see that,
relative to the “ﬁxed” star, the axis of the pair has rotated, i.e., the
two stars are going around each other. Do they rotate according to
Newton’s laws? Careful measurements of the relative positions of
one such double star system are shown in Fig. 5-7. There we see a
beautiful ellipse, the measures starting in 1862 and going all the
way around to 1904 (by now it must have gone around once more).
Everything coincides with Newton’s laws, except that the star Sirius
A is not at the focus. Why should that be? Because the plane of the
ellipse is not in the “plane of the sky.” We are not looking at right
angles to the orbit plane, and when an ellipse is viewed at a tilt, it
remains an ellipse but the focus is no longer at the same place. Thus
we can analyze double stars, moving about each other, according
to the requirements of the gravitational law.
