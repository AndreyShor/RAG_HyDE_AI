Va % # # ir ! Vb,
or
Vb # Va ! # # ir.
(27-8)
To evaluate this expression, we need the current i. Note that the circuit is the
same as in Fig. 27-4a, for which Eq. 27-4 gives the current as
(27-9)
Substituting this equation into Eq. 27-8 gives us
(27-10)
Now substituting the data given in Fig. 27-6, we have
(27-11)
Suppose, instead, we move from a to b counterclockwise, passing through
resistor R rather than through the battery. Because we move opposite the
current, the potential increases by iR.Thus,
Va % iR ! Vb
or
Vb # Va ! iR.
(27-12)
Substituting for i from Eq. 27-9, we again find Eq. 27-10. Hence, substitution of
the data in Fig. 27-6 yields the same result, Vb # Va ! 8.0 V. In general,
Vb # Va !

CHAPTER 27
CIRCUITS
To find the potential between any two points in a circuit, start at one point and 
traverse the circuit to the other point, following any path, and add algebraically
the changes in potential you encounter.
Potential Difference Across a Real Battery
In Fig. 27-6, points a and b are located at the terminals of the battery. Thus, the
potential difference Vb # Va is the terminal-to-terminal potential difference V
across the battery. From Eq. 27-8, we see that
V ! # # ir.
(27-13)
If the internal resistance r of the battery in Fig. 27-6 were zero, Eq. 27-13 tells
us that V would be equal to the emf # of the battery—namely, 12 V. However,
because r ! 2.0 0, Eq. 27-13 tells us that V is less than #. From Eq. 27-11, we
know that V is only 8.0 V. Note that the result depends on the value of the current
through the battery. If the same battery were in a different circuit and had a
different current through it, V would have some other value.
Grounding a Circuit
Figure 27-7a shows the same circuit as Fig. 27-6 except that here point a is directly
connected to ground, as indicated by the common symbol 
. Grounding a cir-
cuit usually means connecting the circuit to a conducting path to Earth’s surface
(actually to the electrically conducting moist dirt and rock below ground). Here,
such a connection means only that the potential is defined to be zero at the
grounding point in the circuit. Thus in Fig. 27-7a, the potential at a is defined to
be Va ! 0. Equation 27-11 then tells us that the potential at b is Vb ! 8.0 V.
