CHAPTER 43
ENERGY FROM THE NUCLEUS
5
For the fission reaction
rank the following possibilities for X (or Y), most likely first: 152Nd,
140I, 128In, 115Pd, 105Mo. (Hint: See Fig. 43-1.)
6
To make the newly discovered, very large elements of the peri-
odic table, researchers shoot a medium-size nucleus at a large nu-
cleus. Sometimes a projectile nucleus and a target nucleus fuse to
form one of the very large elements. In such a fusion, is the mass of
the product greater than or less than the sum of the masses of the
projectile and target nuclei?
7
If we split a nucleus into two smaller nuclei, with a release of
energy, has the average binding energy per nucleon increased or
decreased?
8
Which of these elements is not “cooked up” by thermonuclear
fusion processes in stellar interiors: carbon, silicon, chromium,
bromine?
235U ' n : X ' Y ' 2n,

Lawson’s criterion for the d-t reaction (Eq. 43-16) is 
nt . 1020 s/m3. For the d-d reaction, do you expect the number on
the right-hand side to be the same, smaller, or larger?
10
About 2% of the energy generated in the Sun’s core by the
p-p reaction is carried out of the Sun by neutrinos. Is the energy
associated with this neutrino flux equal to, greater than, or less
than the energy radiated from the Sun’s surface as electromag-
netic radiation?
11
A nuclear reactor is operating at a certain power level, with
its multiplication factor k adjusted to unity. If the control rods are
used to reduce the power output of the reactor to 25% of its for-
mer value, is the multiplication factor now a little less than unity,
substantially less than unity, or still equal to unity?
12
Pick the most likely member of each pair to be one of the ini-
tial fragments formed by a fission event: (a) 93Sr or 93Ru, (b) 140Gd
or 140I, (c) 155Nd or 155Lu. (Hint: See Fig. 42-5 and the periodic table,
and consider the neutron abundance.)

Nuclear Fission
•1
The isotope 235U decays by alpha emission with a half-life of
7.0 " 108 y. It also decays (rarely) by spontaneous fission, and if the
alpha decay did not occur, its half-life due to spontaneous fission
alone would be 3.0 " 1017 y. (a) At what rate do spontaneous fis-
sion decays occur in 1.0 g of 235U? (b) How many 235U alpha-decay
events are there for every spontaneous fission event?
•2
The nuclide 238Np requires 4.2 MeV for fission. To remove a
neutron from this nuclide requires an energy expenditure of 5.0
MeV.Is 237Np fissionable by thermal neutrons?
•3
A thermal neutron (with approximately zero kinetic energy) is
absorbed by a 238U nucleus. How much energy is transferred from
mass energy to the resulting oscillation of the nucleus? Here are some
atomic masses and the neutron mass.

The fission properties of the plutonium isotope 239Pu are very
similar to those of 235U. The average energy released per fission is
180 MeV. How much energy, in MeV, is released if all the atoms in
1.00 kg of pure 239Pu undergo fission?
•5
During the Cold War, the Premier of the Soviet Union threat-
ened the United States with 2.0 megaton 239Pu warheads. (Each
would have yielded the equivalent of an explosion of 2.0 megatons
of TNT, where 1 megaton of TNT releases 
MeV of en-
ergy.) If the plutonium that actually fissioned had been 8.00% of
the total mass of the plutonium in such a warhead, what was that
total mass?

molybdenum isotope 98Mo into two equal parts. The masses you
will need are 97.905 41 u for 98Mo and 48.950 02 u for 49Sc. (b) If Q
turns out to be positive, discuss why this process does not occur
spontaneously.
