CHAPTER 4
MOTION IN TWO AND THREE DIMENSIONS
Average Acceleration and Instantaneous Acceleration
When a particle’s velocity changes from 
to 
in a time interval t, its average
acceleration
during
t is
or
(4-15)
If we shrink -t to zero about some instant, then in the limit 
approaches the
instantaneous acceleration (or acceleration)
at that instant; that is,
(4-16)
If the velocity changes in either magnitude or direction (or both), the particle
must have an acceleration.
We can write Eq.4-16 in unit-vector form by substituting Eq.4-11 for to obtain
We can rewrite this as
(4-17)
where the scalar components of 
are
(4-18)
To find the scalar components of , we differentiate the scalar components of .
Figure 4-6 shows an acceleration vector 
and its scalar components for a
particle moving in two dimensions. Caution: When an acceleration vector is
drawn, as in Fig. 4-6, it does not extend from one position to another. Rather, it
shows the direction of acceleration for a particle located at its tail, and its length
(representing the acceleration magnitude) can be drawn to any scale.
