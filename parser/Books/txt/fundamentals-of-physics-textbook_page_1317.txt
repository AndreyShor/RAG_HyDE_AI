nently trapped inside the nucleus by the barrier,how can the 238U nucleus ever emit
an alpha particle? The answer is that,as you learned in Module 38-9,there is a finite
probability that a particle can tunnel through an energy barrier that is classically
insurmountable.In fact,alpha decay occurs as a result of barrier tunneling.
The very long half-life of 238U tells us that the barrier is apparently not very
“leaky.” If we imagine that an already-formed alpha particle is rattling back and
forth inside the nucleus,it would arrive at the inner surface of the barrier about 1038
times before it would succeed in tunneling through the barrier. This is about 1021
times per second for about 4 " 109 years (the age of Earth)! We,of course,are wait-
ing on the outside, able to count only the alpha particles that do manage to escape
without being able to tell what’s going on inside the nucleus.
We can test this explanation of alpha decay by examining other alpha
emitters. For an extreme contrast, consider the alpha decay of another ura-
nium isotope, 228U, which has a disintegration energy Q4 of 6.81 MeV, about
60% higher than that of 238U. (The value of Q4 is also shown as a horizontal
black line in Fig. 42-10.) Recall from Module 38-9 that the transmission coeffi-
cient of a barrier is very sensitive to small changes in the total energy of the
particle seeking to penetrate it. Thus, we expect alpha decay to occur more
readily for this nuclide than for 238U. Indeed it does. As Table 42-2 shows, its
half-life is only 9.1 min! An increase in Q by a factor of only 1.6 produces a de-
crease in half-life (that is, in the effectiveness of the barrier) by a factor of 3 "
1014.This is sensitivity indeed.

(Answer)
Note that using atomic masses instead of nuclear masses
does not affect the result because the total mass of the elec-
trons in the products subtracts out from the mass of the nu-
cleons ' electrons in the original 238U.
(b) Show that 238U cannot spontaneously emit a proton;
that is, protons do not leak out of the nucleus in spite of the
proton–proton repulsion within the nucleus.
Solution: If this happened, the decay process would be
(You should verify that both nuclear charge and the num-
ber of nucleons are conserved in this process.) Using the
same Key Idea as in part (a) and proceeding as we did there,
we would find that the mass of the two decay products
237.051 21 u ' 1.007 83 u
would exceed the mass of 238U by )m ! 0.008 25 u, with disin-
tegration energy
Q ! #7.68 MeV.
The minus sign indicates that we must add 7.68 MeV to a 238U
nucleus before it will emit a proton; it will certainly not do so
spontaneously.

Q value in an alpha decay, using masses
We are given the following atomic masses:

4He 4.002 60 u
234Th 234.043 63 u

Here Pa is the symbol for the element protactinium 
(Z ! 91).
(a) Calculate the energy released during the alpha decay of
238U.The decay process is
Note, incidentally, how nuclear charge is conserved in this
equation: The atomic numbers of thorium (90) and helium
(2) add up to the atomic number of uranium (92).The num-
ber of nucleons is also conserved: 238 ! 234 ' 4.
KEY IDEA
The energy released in the decay is the disintegration en-
ergy Q, which we can calculate from the change in mass )M
due to the 238U decay.
Calculation: To do this, we use Eq. 37-50,
Q ! Mic 2 # Mfc 2,
(42-23)
where the initial mass Mi is that of 238U and the final mass
Mf is the sum of the 234Th and 4He masses. Using the atomic
masses given in the problem statement, Eq. 42-23 becomes
238U : 234Th ' 4He.
