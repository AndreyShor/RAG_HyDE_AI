comes a time when the pull between the molecules is not enough
to hold them together and they do ﬂy apart and become separated
from one another. Of course, this is how we manufacture steam
out of water—by increasing the temperature; the particles ﬂy apart
because of the increased motion.
In Fig. 1-2 we have a picture of steam. This picture of steam fails
in one respect: at ordinary atmospheric pressure there certainly would
not be as many as three in this ﬁgure. Most squares this size would
contain none—but we accidentally have two and a half or three in
the picture (just so it would not be completely blank). Now in the
case of steam we see the characteristic molecules more clearly than in
the case of water. For simplicity, the molecules are drawn so that there
is a 120° angle between the hydrogen atoms. In actual fact the angle
is 105°3', and the distance between the center of a hydrogen and the
center of the oxygen is 0.957 Å, so we know this molecule very well.
Let us see what some of the properties of steam vapor or any
other gas are. The molecules, being separated from one another,
will bounce against the walls. Imagine a room with a number of
tennis balls (a hundred or so) bouncing around in perpetual mo-
tion. When they bombard the wall, this pushes the wall away. (Of
course we would have to push the wall back.) This means that the
gas exerts a jittery force which our coarse senses (not being ourselves
magniﬁed a billion times) feel only as an average push. In order to
conﬁne a gas we must apply a pressure. Figure 1-3 shows a standard
