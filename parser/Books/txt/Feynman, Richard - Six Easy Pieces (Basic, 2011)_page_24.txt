more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room
stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing
some of his intended audience. But even in Feynman’s view, his
pedagogical endeavor did not succeed. He wrote in the 1963 pref-
ace to the Lectures: “I don’t think I did very well by the students.”
Rereading the books, one sometimes seems to catch Feynman look-
ing over his shoulder, not at his young audience, but directly at his
colleagues, saying, “Look at that! Look how I ﬁnessed that point!
Wasn’t that clever?” But even when he thought he was explaining
things lucidly to freshmen or sophomores, it was not really they
who were able to beneﬁt most from what he was doing. It was his
peers—scientists, physicists, and professors—who would be the
main beneﬁciaries of his magniﬁcent achievement, which was noth-
ing less than to see physics through the fresh and dynamic perspec-
tive of Richard Feynman.
Feynman was more than a great teacher. His gift was that he was
an extraordinary teacher of teachers. If the purpose in giving The
Feynman Lectures on Physics was to prepare a roomful of undergrad-
uate students to solve examination problems in physics, he cannot
be said to have succeeded particularly well. Moreover, if the intent
was for the books to serve as introductory college textbooks, he
cannot be said to have achieved his goal. Nevertheless, the books
have been translated into ten foreign languages and are available in
four bilingual editions. Feynman himself believed that his most im-
portant contribution to physics would not be QED, or the theory
of superﬂuid helium, or polarons, or partons. His foremost contri-
bution would be the three red books of The Feynman Lectures on
Physics. That belief fully justiﬁes this commemorative issue of these
celebrated books.
