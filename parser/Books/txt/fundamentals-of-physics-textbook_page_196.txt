CHAPTER 7
KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK
6
Figure 7-19 gives the x com-
ponent Fx of a force that can act
on a particle. If the particle be-
gins at rest at x ! 0, what is its
coordinate when it has (a) its
greatest kinetic energy, (b) its
greatest speed, and (c) zero
speed? (d) What is the particle’s
direction 
of 
travel 
after 
it
reaches x ! 6 m?

In Fig. 7-20, a greased pig has a choice of three frictionless slides
along which to slide to the ground. Rank the slides according to how
much work the gravitational force does on the pig during the descent,
greatest first.

Figure 7-21a shows four situations in which a horizontal force acts
on the same block, which is initially at rest.The force magnitudes are
F2 ! F4 ! 2F1 ! 2F3. The horizontal component vx of the block’s ve-
locity is shown in Fig. 7-21b for the four situations. (a) Which plot in
Fig. 7-21b best corresponds to which force in Fig. 7-21a? (b) Which

In three situations, a single force acts on a moving particle.
Here are the velocities (at that instant) and the forces:
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
. Rank
the situations according to the rate at which energy is being trans-
ferred, greatest transfer to the particle ranked first, greatest trans-
fer from the particle ranked last.

Figure 7-23 shows three arrangements of a block attached to
identical springs that are in their relaxed state when the block is
centered as shown. Rank the arrangements according to the mag-
nitude of the net force on the block, largest first, when the block is
displaced by distance d (a) to the right and (b) to the left. Rank the
arrangements according to the work done on the block by the
spring forces, greatest first, when the block is displaced by d (c) to
the right and (d) to the left.

Spring A is stiffer than spring B (kA ) kB). The spring force of
which spring does more work if the springs are compressed (a) the
same distance and (b) by the same applied force?

cliff. Which of the graphs in Fig. 7-22 could possibly show how the
kinetic energy of the glob changes during its flight?

Kinetic Energy

A proton (mass m ! 1.67 ' 10$27 kg) is being acceler-
ated along a straight line at 3.6
1015 m/s2 in a machine. If the pro-
ton has an initial speed of 2.4 ' 107 m/s and travels 3.5 cm, what
then is (a) its speed and (b) the increase in its kinetic energy?
