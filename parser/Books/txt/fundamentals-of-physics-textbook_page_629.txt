A gas, confined to an insulated cylinder, is compressed
adiabatically to half its volume. Does the entropy of the gas
increase, decrease, or remain unchanged during this process?

An ideal monatomic gas at initial temperature T0 (in kelvins) ex-
pands from initial vol-
ume V0 to volume 2V0
by each of the five
processes indicated in
the T-V diagram of
Fig. 20-20. In which
process is the expan-
sion (a) isothermal,(b) isobaric (constant pressure),and (c) adiabatic?
Explain your answers. (d) In which processes does the entropy of the
gas decrease?

In four experiments, 2.5
mol of hydrogen gas under-
goes reversible isothermal
expansions,
starting from
the same volume but at dif-
ferent temperatures.
The
corresponding p-V plots are
shown in Fig. 20-21. Rank
the 
situations 
according
to the change in the entropy
of the gas, greatest first.

A box contains 100 atoms in a configuration that has
50 atoms in each half of the box. Suppose that you could count
the different microstates associated with this configuration at the
rate of 100 billion states per second, using a supercomputer.
Without written calculation, guess how much computing time
you would need: a day, a year, or much more than a year.

Does the entropy per cycle increase, decrease, or remain the
same for (a) a Carnot engine, (b) a real engine, and (c) a perfect
engine (which is, of course, impossible to build)?
8
Three Carnot engines operate between temperature limits of
(a) 400 and 500 K, (b) 500 and 600 K, and (c) 400 and 600 K. Each
engine extracts the same amount of energy per cycle from the
high-temperature reservoir. Rank the magnitudes of the work
done by the engines per cycle, greatest first.

An inventor claims to have invented four engines, each of which
operates between constant-temperature reservoirs at 400 and 300 K.
Data on each engine, per cycle of operation, are: engine A, QH # 200
J,QL # $175 J,and W # 40 J;engine B,QH # 500 J,QL # $200 J,and
W # 400 J;engine C,QH # 600 J,QL # $200 J,and W # 400 J;engine
D,QH # 100 J,QL # $90 J,and W # 10 J.Of the first and second laws
of thermodynamics,which (if either) does each engine violate?

Does the entropy per cycle increase, decrease, or remain the
same for (a) a Carnot refrigerator, (b) a real refrigerator, and (c) a
perfect refrigerator (which is, of course, impossible to build)?

QUESTIONS
For a Carnot refrigerator, Eq. 20-14 becomes
(20-15, 20-16)
A perfect refrigerator is an imaginary refrigerator in which
energy extracted as heat from the low-temperature reservoir is con-
verted completely to heat discharged to the high-temperature reser-
voir, without any need for work. Such a refrigerator would violate
the second law of thermodynamics, which can be restated as follows:
No series of processes is possible whose sole result is the transfer of
energy as heat from a reservoir at a given temperature to a reservoir
at a higher temperature.
Entropy from a Statistical View
The entropy of a system can
be defined in terms of the possible distributions of its molecules. For
identical molecules,each possible distribution of molecules is called a
microstate of the system.All equivalent microstates are grouped into

!QH! $ !QL! #

.
a configuration of the system.The number of microstates in a config-
uration is the multiplicity W of the configuration.
For a system of N molecules that may be distributed between
the two halves of a box, the multiplicity is given by
(20-20)
in which n1 is the number of molecules in one half of the box and n2 is
the number in the other half. A basic assumption of statistical
mechanics is that all the microstates are equally probable.Thus, con-
figurations with a large multiplicity occur most often.
The multiplicity W of a configuration of a system and the en-
tropy S of the system in that configuration are related by
Boltzmann’s entropy equation:
S # k ln W,
(20-21)
where k # 1.38 ' 10$23 J/K is the Boltzmann constant.

Point i in Fig. 20-19 represents
the initial state of an ideal gas at 
temperature
T. Taking algebraic
signs into account, rank the entropy
changes that the gas undergoes as it
moves, successively and reversibly,
from point i to points a, b, c, and d,
greatest first.

In four experiments, blocks A
and B, starting at different initial
temperatures, were brought together in an insulating box and al-
lowed to reach a common final temperature. The entropy changes
for the blocks in the four experiments had the following values (in
joules per kelvin), but not necessarily in the order given.
Determine which values for A go with which values for B.
