A beam of polarized light is sent into a system of two polar-
izing sheets. Relative to the polarization direction of that incident
light, the polarizing directions of the sheets are at angles u for the
first sheet and 90° for the second sheet. If 0.10 of the incident in-
tensity is transmitted by the two sheets, what is u?

In Fig. 33-41, unpolarized light is sent into a system of two
polarizing sheets. The angles u1 and u2 of the polarizing directions
of the sheets are measured counterclockwise from the positive di-
rection of the y axis (they are not drawn to scale in the figure).
Angle u1 is fixed but angle u2 can be varied. Figure 33-45 gives
the intensity of the light emerging from sheet 2 as a function of u2.
(The scale of the intensity axis is not indicated.) What percentage
of the light’s initial intensity is transmitted by the two-sheet system
when u2 ! 90°?

centage of the initial intensity is transmitted by the system? (Hint:
Be careful with the angles.)

In Fig. 33-40, initially unpolarized light is sent into a
system of three polarizing sheets whose polarizing directions make
angles of u1 ! 40°, u2 ! 20°, and u3 ! 40° with the direction of the y
axis. What percentage of the light’s initial intensity is transmitted
by the system? (Hint: Be careful with the angles.)

In Fig. 33-41, a beam of unpolarized
light, with intensity 43 W/m2, is sent into a
system of two polarizing sheets with
polarizing directions at angles u1 ! 70° and
u2 ! 90° to the y axis.What is the intensity of
the light transmitted by the system?

In Fig. 33-41, a beam of light, with
intensity 43 W/m2 and polarization parallel
to a y axis, is sent into a system of two
polarizing sheets with polarizing directions at
angles  of 
and u2
90" to the y axis. What is the intensity
of the light transmitted by the two-sheet system?
••36
At a beach the light is generally partially polarized
due to reflections off sand and water. At a particular beach on
a particular day near sundown, the horizontal component of the
electric field vector is 2.3 times the vertical component. A stand-
ing sunbather puts on polarizing sunglasses; the glasses eliminate
the horizontal field component. (a) What fraction of the light in-
tensity received before the glasses were put on now reaches the
sunbather’s eyes? (b) The sunbather, still wearing the glasses, lies
on his side. What fraction of the light intensity received before
the glasses were put on now reaches his eyes?
••37
We want to rotate the direction of polarization
of a beam of polarized light through 90° by sending the beam
through one or more polarizing sheets. (a) What is the minimum
number of sheets required? (b) What is the minimum number of
sheets required if the transmitted intensity is to be more than 60%
of the original intensity?

In Fig. 33-42, unpolarized light is sent into a system of
three polarizing sheets. The angles u1, u2, and u3 of the polarizing
directions are measured counterclockwise from the positive di-
rection of the y axis (they are not drawn to scale). Angles u1 and
u3 are fixed, but angle u2 can be varied. Figure 33-43 gives the
intensity of the light emerging from sheet 3 as a function of u2.
(The scale of the intensity axis is not indicated.) What percentage
of the light’s initial intensity is transmitted by the system when 
u2 ! 30°?

Unpolarized light of intensity 10 mW/m2 is sent into a po-
larizing sheet as in Fig. 33-11. What are (a) the amplitude of the
electric field component of the transmitted light and (b) the radi-
ation pressure on the sheet due to its absorbing some of the light?

In Fig. 33-42, unpolarized light is sent into a system
of three polarizing sheets. The angles u1, u2, and u3 of the polariz-
ing directions are measured counterclockwise from the positive
direction of the y axis (they are not drawn to scale).Angles u1 and
u3 are fixed, but angle u2 can be varied. Figure 33-44 gives the
intensity of the light emerging from sheet 3 as a function of u2.
(The scale of the intensity axis is not indicated.) What percentage
of the light’s initial intensity is transmitted by the three-sheet
system when u2 ! 90°?

A beam of partially polarized light can be considered to be a
mixture of polarized and unpolarized light. Suppose we send such
a beam through a polarizing filter and then rotate the filter
through 360° while keeping it perpendicular to the beam. If the
transmitted intensity varies by a factor of 5.0 during the rotation,
what fraction of the intensity of the original beam is associated
with the beam’s polarized light?

In Fig. 33-42, unpolarized light is sent into a system of three
polarizing sheets, which transmits 0.0500 of the initial light inten-
sity. The polarizing directions of the first and third sheets are at
angles u1 ! 0° and u3 ! 90°.What are the (a) smaller and (b) larger
possible values of angle u2 (% 90°) for the polarizing direction of
sheet 2?
