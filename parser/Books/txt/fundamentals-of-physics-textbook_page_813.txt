27-2 MULTILOOP CIRCUITS
Replacing the parallel combination with Req, we obtain the
simplified circuit of Fig. 27-12d. Applying the loop rule to
this circuit counterclockwise from point b, we have
#row # iRw # iReq ! 0.
Solving for i and substituting the known data, we find
(Answer)
If the head or tail of the eel is near a fish, some of this
current could pass along a narrow path through the fish,
stunning or killing it.

(b) How much current irow travels through each row of 
Fig. 27-12a?
KEY IDEA
Because the rows are identical, the current into and out of
the eel is evenly divided among them.
Calculation: Thus, we write
(Answer)
Thus, the current through each row is small, so that the eel
need not stun or kill itself when it stuns or kills a fish.

Combining equations: We now have a system of two equa-
tions (Eqs. 27-27 and 27-28) in two unknowns (i1 and i2) to
solve either “by hand” (which is easy enough here) or with a
“math package.” (One solution technique is Cramer’s rule,
given in Appendix E.) We find
i1 ! #0.50 A.
(27-29)
(The minus sign signals that our arbitrary choice of direction
for i1 in Fig. 27-13 is wrong, but we must wait to correct it.)
Substituting i1 ! #0.50 A into Eq. 27-28 and solving for
i2 then give us
i2 ! 0.25 A.
(Answer)
With Eq. 27-26 we then find that
i3 ! i1 % i2 ! #0.50 A % 0.25 A
! #0.25 A.
The positive answer we obtained for i2signals that our choice of
direction for that current is correct. However, the negative an-
swers for i1 and i3 indicate that our choices for those currents are
wrong.Thus,as a last step here,we correct the answers by revers-
ing the arrows for i1 and i3 in Fig.27-13 and then writing
i1 ! 0.50 A
and
i3 ! 0.25 A.
(Answer)
Caution: Always make any such correction as the last step
and not before calculating all the currents.
Figure 27-13 shows a circuit whose elements have the fol-
lowing values:
The three batteries are ideal batteries. Find the mag-
nitude and direction of the current in each of the three
branches.
KEY IDEAS
It is not worthwhile to try to simplify this circuit, because no
two resistors are in parallel, and the resistors that are in series
(those in the right branch or those in the left branch) present
no problem.So,our plan is to apply the junction and loop rules.
Junction rule: Using arbitrarily chosen directions for the cur-
rents as shown in Fig. 27-13, we apply the junction rule at point
a by writing
i3 ! i1 % i2.
(27-26)
An application of the junction rule at junction b gives only
the same equation, so we next apply the loop rule to any two
of the three loops of the circuit.
Left-hand loop: We first arbitrarily choose the left-hand
loop, arbitrarily start at point b, and arbitrarily traverse the
loop in the clockwise direction, obtaining
#i1R1 % #1 # i1R1 # (i1 % i2)R2 # #2 ! 0,
where we have used (i1 % i2) instead of i3 in the middle
branch. Substituting the given data and simplifying yield
i1(8.0 0) % i2(4.0 0) ! #3.0 V.
(27-27)
Right-hand loop: For our second application of the loop
rule, we arbitrarily choose to traverse the right-hand loop
counterclockwise from point b, finding
#i2R1 % #2 # i2R1# (i1% i2)R2 # #2! 0.
Substituting the given data and simplifying yield
i1(4.0 0) % i2(8.0 0) ! 0.
(27-28)
