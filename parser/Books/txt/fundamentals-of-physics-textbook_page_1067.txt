PROBLEMS
situation, each problem in Table 34-7 gives object distance p, index
of refraction n of the lens, radius r1 of the nearer lens surface, and
radius r2 of the farther lens surface. (All distances are in
centimeters.) Find (a) the image distance i and (b) the lateral mag-
nification m of the object, including signs. Also, determine
whether the image is (c) real (R) or virtual (V), (d) inverted (I)
from object O or noninverted (NI), and (e) on the same side of the
lens as object O or on the opposite side.

In Fig. 34-44, a real inverted
image I of an object O is formed by
a particular lens (not shown); the
object–image separation is d ! 40.0
cm, measured along the central axis
of the lens. The image is just half the
size of the object. (a) What kind of
lens must be used to produce this
image? (b) How far from the object must the lens be placed? (c)
What is the focal length of the lens?

stands on the central axis of a thin symmetric lens. For this situa-
tion, each problem in Table 34-8 refers to (a) the lens type, con-

verging (C) or diverging (D), (b) the focal distance f, (c) the object
distance p, (d) the image distance i, and (e) the lateral magnifica-
tion m. (All distances are in centimeters.) It also refers to whether
(f) the image is real (R) or virtual (V), (g) inverted (I) or nonin-
verted (NI) from O, and (h) on the same side of the lens as O or on
the opposite side. Fill in the missing information, including the
value of m when only an inequality is given. Where only a sign is
missing, answer with the sign.

Fig. 34-45, stick figure O (the object) stands on the common central
axis of two thin, symmetric lenses, which are mounted in the boxed
regions. Lens 1 is mounted within the boxed region closer to O,
which is at object distance p1. Lens 2 is mounted within the farther
