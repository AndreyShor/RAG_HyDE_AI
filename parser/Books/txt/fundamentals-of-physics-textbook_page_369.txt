Static Equilibrium
A rigid body at rest is said to be in static
equilibrium. For such a body, the vector sum of the external forces
acting on it is zero:
(balance of forces).
(12-3)
If all the forces lie in the xy plane, this vector equation is equiva-
lent to two component equations:
Fnet,x ! 0
and
Fnet,y ! 0
(balance of forces).
(12-7, 12-8)
Static equilibrium also implies that the vector sum of the external
torques acting on the body about any point is zero, or
(balance of torques).
(12-5)
If the forces lie in the xy plane, all torque vectors are parallel to the
z axis, and Eq. 12-5 is equivalent to the single component equation
tnet,z ! 0
(balance of torques).
(12-9)
Center of Gravity
The gravitational force acts individually on
each element of a body.The net effect of all individual actions may
be found by imagining an equivalent total gravitational force 
acting at the center of gravity. If the gravitational acceleration 
is
the same for all the elements of the body, the center of gravity is at
the center of mass.
Elastic Moduli
Three elastic moduli are used to describe the
elastic behavior (deformations) of objects as they respond to
forces that act on them. The strain (fractional change in length) is
linearly related to the applied stress (force per unit area) by the
proper modulus, according to the general relation
stress ! modulus $ strain.

Review & Summary
Tension and Compression
When an object is under tension
or compression, Eq. 12-22 is written as
(12-23)
where 'L/L is the tensile or compressive strain of the object, F is
the magnitude of the applied force 
causing the strain, A is the
cross-sectional area over which 
is applied (perpendicular to A,
as in Fig. 12-11a), and E is the Young’s modulus for the object.The
stress is F/A.
Shearing
When an object is under a shearing stress, Eq. 12-22 is
written as
(12-24)
where 'x/L is the shearing strain of the object, 'x is the
displacement of one end of the object in the direction of the ap-
plied force 
(as in Fig. 12-11b), and G is the shear modulus of the
object.The stress is F/A.
Hydraulic Stress
When an object undergoes hydraulic com-
pression due to a stress exerted by a surrounding fluid, Eq. 12-22 is
written as
(12-25)
where p is the pressure (hydraulic stress) on the object due to the
fluid, 'V/V (the strain) is the absolute value of the fractional
change in the object’s volume due to that pressure, and B is the
bulk modulus of the object.

Figure 12-15 shows three situations in which the same
horizontal rod is supported by a hinge on a wall at one end and a
cord at its other end. Without written calculation, rank the situa-
tions according to the magnitudes of (a) the force on the rod
from the cord, (b) the vertical force on the rod from the hinge,
and (c) the horizontal force on the rod from the hinge, greatest
first.
compared to that of the safe.(a) Rank the positions according to
the force on post A due to the safe, greatest compression first,
greatest tension last, and indicate where, if anywhere, the force is
zero. (b) Rank them according to the force on post B.

Figure 12-17 shows four overhead views of rotating uniform
disks that are sliding across a frictionless floor. Three forces, of
magnitude F, 2F, or 3F, act on each disk, either at the rim, at the
center, or halfway between rim and center.The force vectors rotate
along with the disks, and, in the “snapshots” of Fig. 12-17, point left
or right.Which disks are in equilibrium?

A ladder leans against a frictionless wall but is prevented from
falling because of friction between it and the ground. Suppose
you shift the base of the ladder toward the wall. Determine
whether the following become larger, smaller, or stay the same (in
