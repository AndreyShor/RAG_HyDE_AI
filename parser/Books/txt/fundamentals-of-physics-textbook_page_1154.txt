CHAPTER 37
RELATIVITY
matters here; whether either is stationary relative to, say, a
space station is irrelevant. In Figs. 37-8a and b we took
Sally to be stationary, but we could instead have taken
the ship to be stationary, with Sally moving to the left
past it. Event 1 is again when Sally and point B are aligned
(Fig. 37-8c), and event 2 is again when Sally and point C
are aligned (Fig. 37-8d). However, we are now using Sam’s
measurements. So the length between the two events in his
frame is the proper length L0 of the ship and the time in-
terval between them is not Sally’s measurement 2t but a
dilated time interval g 2t.
Substituting Sam’s measurements into Eq. 37-17, we have
,
which is exactly what we found using Sally’s measurements.
Thus, we get the same result of v ! 0.210c with either set of
measurements, but we must be careful not to mix the mea-
surements from the two frames.
v ! L0
g2t
We do not know L, but we can relate it to the given L0:
The distance between the two events as measured from Sam’s
frame is the ship’s proper length L0. Thus, the distance L
measured from Sally’s frame must be less than L0, as given by
Eq.37-13 (L ! L0/g) for length contraction.Substituting L0/g
for L in Eq.37-18 and then substituting Eq.37-8 for g,we find
Solving this equation for v (notice that it is on the left and
also buried in the Lorentz factor) leads us to
.

Note that only the relative motion of Sally and Sam

Sample Problem 37.04
Time dilation and length contraction in outrunning a supernova
Caught by surprise near a supernova, you race away from the
explosion in your spaceship, hoping to outrun the high-speed
material ejected toward you. Your Lorentz factor g relative
to the inertial reference frame of the local stars is 22.4.
(a) To reach a safe distance, you figure you need to cover
9.00 ( 1016 m as measured in the reference frame of the local
stars. How long will the flight take, as measured in that frame?
KEY IDEAS
From Chapter 2, for constant speed, we know that
(37-19)
From Fig. 37-6, we see that because your Lorentz factor g
relative to the stars is 22.4 (large), your relative speed v is
almost c—so close that we can approximate it as c. Then for
speed v % c, we must be careful that the distance and the
time interval in Eq. 37-19 are measured in the same refer-
ence frame.
Calculations: The given distance (9.00 ( 1016 m) for the
length of your travel path is measured in the reference
frame of the stars, and the requested time interval 2t is to be
measured in that same frame.Thus, we can write
Then substituting the given distance, we find that

(b) How long does that trip take according to you (in your
reference frame)?
KEY IDEAS
1.
We now want the time interval measured in a different
reference frame—namely, yours.Thus, we need to trans-
form the data given in the reference frame of the stars to
your frame.
2.
The given path length of 9.00 ( 1016 m, measured in the
reference frame of the stars, is a proper length L0, be-
cause the two ends of the path are at rest in that frame.
As observed from your reference frame, the stars’ refer-
ence frame and those two ends of the path race past you
at a relative speed of v % c.
3.
You measure a contracted length L0/g for the path, not
the proper length L0.
Calculations: We can now rewrite Eq. 37-19 as
Substituting known data, we find
(Answer)
In part (a) we found that the flight takes 9.51 y in the refer-
ence frame of the stars. However, here we find that it takes
only 0.425 y in your frame, due to the relative motion and
the resulting contracted length of the path.
