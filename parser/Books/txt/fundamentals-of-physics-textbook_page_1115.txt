Plots. Figure 36-8 shows plots of the intensity of a single-slit diffraction pattern,
calculated with Eqs. 36-5 and 36-6 for three slit widths: a ! l, a ! 5l, and a ! 10l.
Note that as the slit width increases (relative to the wavelength), the width of the
central diffraction maximum (the central hill-like region of the graphs) decreases;
that is, the light undergoes less flaring by the slit. The secondary maxima also de-
crease in width (and become weaker). In the limit of slit width a being much greater
than wavelength l, the secondary maxima due to the slit disappear; we then no
longer have single-slit diffraction (but we still have diffraction due to the edges of
the wide slit,like that produced by the edges of the razor blade in Fig.36-2).
Proof of Eqs. 36-5 and 36-6
To find an expression for the intensity at a point in the diffraction pattern, we
need to divide the slit into many zones and then add the phasors corresponding to
those zones, as we did in Fig. 36-7. The arc of phasors in Fig. 36-9 represents
the wavelets that reach an arbitrary point P on the viewing screen of Fig.36-4,corre-
sponding to a particular small angle u.The amplitude Eu of the resultant wave at P is
the vector sum of these phasors. If we divide the slit of Fig. 36-4 into infinitesimal
zones of width x, the arc of phasors in Fig. 36-9 approaches the arc of a circle; we
call its radius R as indicated in that figure.The length of the arc must be Em, the am-
plitude at the center of the diffraction pattern,because if we straightened out the arc
we would have the phasor arrangement of Fig.36-7a (shown lightly in Fig.36-9).
The angle f in the lower part of Fig. 36-9 is the difference in phase between
the infinitesimal vectors at the left and right ends of arc Em. From the geometry, f
is also the angle between the two radii marked R in Fig. 36-9. The dashed line in
that figure, which bisects f, then forms two congruent right triangles. From either
triangle we can write
(36-9)
In radian measure, f is (with Em considered to be a circular arc)
Solving this equation for R and substituting in Eq. 36-9 lead to
(36-10)
Intensity. In Module 33-2 we saw that the intensity of an electromagnetic
wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude of its electric field. Here, this
means that the maximum intensity Im (at the center of the pattern) is propor-
tional to 
and the intensity I(u) at angle u is proportional to 
Thus,
(36-11)
Substituting for Eu with Eq. 36-10 and then substituting 
we are led to Eq.
36-5 for the intensity as a function of u:
The second equation we wish to prove relates a to u. The phase difference f
between the rays from the top and bottom of the entire slit may be related to a
path length difference with Eq. 36-4; it tells us that
where a is the sum of the widths 2x of the infinitesimal zones. However, f ! 2a,
so this equation reduces to Eq. 36-6.
