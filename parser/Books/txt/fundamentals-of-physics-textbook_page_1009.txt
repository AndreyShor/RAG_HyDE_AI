33.24 Distinguish between force and pressure.
33.25 Identify that an electromagnetic wave transports
momentum and can exert a force and a pressure on 
a target.
33.26 For a uniform electromagnetic beam that is perpendi-
cular to a target area, apply the relationships between that
area, the wave’s intensity, and the force on the target, for
both total absorption and total backward reflection.

total absorption and total backward reflection.
Learning Objectives
●When a surface intercepts electromagnetic radiation, a
force and a pressure are exerted on the surface. 
●If the radiation is totally absorbed by the surface, the force is
(total absorption),
in which I is the intensity of the radiation and A is the area of
the surface perpendicular to the path of the radiation. 
●If the radiation is totally reflected back along its original
F ! IA
c
path, the force is
(total reflection back along path).
●The radiation pressure pr is the force per unit area:
(total absorption)
and
(total reflection back along path).

Key Ideas
KEY IDEAS
1.
The rms value Erms of the electric field in light is re-
lated to the intensity I of the light via Eq. 33-26
2.
Because the source is so far away and emits light with
equal intensity in all directions, the intensity I at any
distance r from the source is related to the source’s
power Ps via Eq. 33-27 (I ! Ps/4pr2).
3.
The magnitudes of the electric field and magnetic field
of an electromagnetic wave at any instant and at any
point in the wave are related by the speed of light c
according to Eq. 33-5 (E/B ! c). Thus, the rms values of
those fields are also related by Eq. 33-5.

Magnetic field: From Eq. 33-5, we write
Cannot compare the fields: Note that Erms (! 1.2 mV/m) is
small as judged by ordinary laboratory standards, but Brms
(! 4.1 pT) is quite small.This difference helps to explain why
most instruments used for the detection and measurement of
electromagnetic waves are designed to respond to the electric
component. It is wrong, however, to say that the electric com-
ponent of an electromagnetic wave is “stronger” than the
magnetic component.You cannot compare quantities that are
measured in different units. However, these electric and mag-
netic components are on an equal basis because their average
energies,which can be compared,are equal.

Radiation Pressure
Electromagnetic waves have linear momentum and thus can exert a pressure on
an object when shining on it. However, the pressure must be very small because,
for example, you do not feel a punch during a camera flash.
