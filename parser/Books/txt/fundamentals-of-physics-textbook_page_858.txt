Figure 28-45 shows a rec-
tangular 20-turn coil of wire, of di-
mensions 10 cm by 5.0 cm. It carries
a current of 0.10 A and is hinged
along one long side. It is mounted in
the xy plane, at angle u ! 30" to the
direction of a uniform magnetic field
of magnitude 0.50 T. In unit-vector
notation, what is the torque acting
on the coil about the hinge line?

An electron moves in a circle
of radius r ! 5.29 $ 10%11 m with
speed 2.19 $ 106 m/s. Treat the circular path as a current loop
with a constant current equal to the ratio of the electron’s charge
magnitude to the period of the motion. If the circle lies in a uni-
form magnetic field of magnitude B ! 7.10 mT, what is the maxi-
mum possible magnitude of the torque produced on the loop by
the field?

Figure 28-46 shows a wood cylinder of mass m ! 0.250 kg
and length L ! 0.100 m, with N ! 10.0 turns of wire wrapped
around it longitudinally, so that the
plane of the wire coil contains the
long central axis of the cylinder. The
cylinder is released on a plane in-
clined at an angle u to the horizontal,
with the plane of the coil parallel to
the incline plane. If there is a vertical
uniform magnetic field of magnitude
0.500 T, what is the least current i

der from rolling down the plane?

In Fig. 28-44, a metal wire of mass m
24.1 mg can slide
with negligible friction on two horizontal parallel rails separated
by distance d ! 2.56 cm. The track lies in a vertical uniform mag-
netic field of magnitude 56.3 mT. At time t ! 0, device G is con-
nected to the rails, producing a constant current i ! 9.13 mA in the

In Fig. 28-47, a rectangular loop car-
rying current lies in the plane of a uniform
magnetic field of magnitude 0.040 T. The
loop consists of a single turn of flexible con-
ducting wire that is wrapped around a flexi-
ble mount such that the dimensions of the
rectangle can be changed. (The total length
of the wire is not changed.) As edge length x
is varied from approximately zero to its
maximum value of approximately 4.0 cm, the magnitude t of
the torque on the loop changes. The maximum value of t is 4.80 $
10%8 N)m.What is the current in the loop?

Prove that the relation t ! NiAB sin u holds not only for the
rectangular loop of Fig. 28-19 but also for a closed loop of any
shape. (Hint: Replace the loop of arbitrary shape with an assembly
of adjacent long, thin, approximately rectangular loops that are
nearly equivalent to the loop of arbitrary shape as far as the distri-
bution of current is concerned.)
