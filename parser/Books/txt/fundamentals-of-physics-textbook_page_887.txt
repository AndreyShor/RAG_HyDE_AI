In Fig. 29-71, a long circular pipe
with outside radius R ! 2.6 cm carries a
(uniformly 
distributed) 
current 
i !
8.00 mA into the page.A wire runs parallel
to the pipe at a distance of 3.00R from cen-
ter to center. Find the (a) magnitude and
(b) direction (into or out of the page) of the
current in the wire such that the net mag-
netic field at point P has the same magni-

of the pipe but is in the opposite direction.

Solenoids and Toroids
•49
A toroid having a square cross section, 5.00 cm on a side, and
an inner radius of 15.0 cm has 500 turns and carries a current of 0.800
A. (It is made up of a square solenoid—instead of a round one as in
Fig. 29-17—bent into a doughnut shape.) What is the magnetic field
inside the toroid at (a) the inner radius and (b) the outer radius?

A solenoid that is 95.0 cm long has a radius of 2.00 cm and
a winding of 1200 turns; it carries a current of 3.60 A. Calculate
the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid.
•51
A 200-turn solenoid having a length of 25 cm and a diameter
of 10 cm carries a current of 0.29 A. Calculate the magnitude of the
magnetic field 
inside the solenoid.
•52
A solenoid 1.30 m long and 2.60 cm in diameter carries a cur-
rent of 18.0 A. The magnetic field inside the solenoid is 23.0 mT.
Find the length of the wire forming the solenoid.
••53
A long solenoid has 100 turns/cm and carries current i. An
electron moves within the solenoid in a circle of radius 2.30 cm
perpendicular to the solenoid axis. The speed of the electron is
0.0460c (c ! speed of light). Find the current i in the solenoid.
••54
An electron is shot into one end of a solenoid. As it
enters the uniform magnetic field within the solenoid, its speed
is 800 m/s and its velocity vector makes an angle of 30° with the
central axis of the solenoid. The solenoid carries 4.0 A and has
8000 turns along its length. How many revolutions does the elec-
tron make along its helical path within the solenoid by the time it
emerges from the solenoid’s opposite end? (In a real solenoid,
where the field is not uniform at the two ends, the number of rev-
olutions would be slightly less than the answer here.)
••55
A long solenoid with 10.0 turns/cm and a
radius of 7.00 cm carries a current of 20.0 mA. A current of 6.00 A
exists in a straight conductor located along the central axis of the sole-
noid. (a) At what radial distance from the axis will the direction of the
resulting magnetic field be at 45.0° to
the axial direction? (b) What is the
magnitude of the magnetic field there?

A circular loop of radius 12 cm carries a current of 15 A. A
flat coil of radius 0.82 cm, having 50 turns and a current of 1.3 A, is
concentric with the loop. The plane of the loop is perpendicular to
the plane of the coil. Assume the
loop’s magnetic field is uniform
across the coil. What is the magni-
tude of (a) the magnetic field 
produced by the loop at its center
and (b) the torque on the coil due
to the loop?

two radial lengths and two semicir-
300 turns of wire around a wooden cylinder of diameter d ! 5.0 cm.

the wire. (a) What is the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment

d will the magnetic
field have the magnitude 5.0 mT (approximately one-tenth that of
Earth’s magnetic field)?

73b the same length of wire has been
bent to give a coil of two turns, each of
half the original radius. (a) If Ba and Bb
are the magnitudes of the magnetic

nitudes of the coils?

In Fig. 29-74a, two circular loops, with different 
currents but the same radius of 4.0 cm, are centered on a y axis.
They are initially separated by distance L ! 3.0 cm, with loop 2 po-
sitioned at the origin of the axis. The currents in the two loops pro-
duce a net magnetic field at the origin, with y component By. That
component is to be measured as loop 2 is gradually moved in the
positive direction of the y axis. Figure 29-74b gives By as a function
of the position y of loop 2. The curve approaches an asymptote of
By ! 7.20 mT as y : .. The horizontal scale is set by ys ! 10.0 cm.
What are (a) current i1 in loop 1 and (b) current i2 in loop 2?
