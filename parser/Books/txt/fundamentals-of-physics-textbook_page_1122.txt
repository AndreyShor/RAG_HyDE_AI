Photos. Figure 36-16a shows an actual pattern in which both double-slit
interference and diffraction are evident. If one slit is covered, the single-slit
diffraction pattern of Fig. 36-16b results. Note the correspondence between
Figs. 36-16a and 36-15c, and between Figs. 36-16b and 36-15b. In comparing
these figures, bear in mind that Fig. 36-16 has been deliberately overexposed to
bring out the faint secondary maxima and that several secondary maxima
(rather than one) are shown.
Intensity. With diffraction effects taken into account,the intensity of a double-
slit interference pattern is given by
(double slit),
(36-19)
in which
(36-20)
and
(36-21)
Here d is the distance between the centers of the slits and a is the slit width. Note
carefully that the right side of Eq. 36-19 is the product of Im and two factors. (1) The
interference factor cos2 b is due to the interference between two slits with slit separa-
tion d (as given by Eqs. 35-22 and 35-23). (2) The diffraction factor [(sin a)/a]2 is due
to diffraction by a single slit of width a (as given by Eqs.36-5 and 36-6).
Let us check these factors. If we let a : 0 in Eq. 36-21, for example, then
a : 0 and (sin a)/a : 1. Equation 36-19 then reduces, as it must, to an equation
describing the interference pattern for a pair of vanishingly narrow slits with slit
separation d. Similarly, putting d ! 0 in Eq. 36-20 is equivalent physically to caus-
ing the two slits to merge into a single slit of width a.Then Eq. 36-20 yields b ! 0
and cos2 b ! 1. In this case Eq. 36-19 reduces, as it must, to an equation describing
the diffraction pattern for a single slit of width a.
Language. The double-slit pattern described by Eq. 36-19 and displayed in Fig.
36-16a combines interference and diffraction in an intimate way. Both are superpo-
sition effects, in that they result from the combining of waves with different phases
at a given point. If the combining waves originate from a small number of elemen-
tary coherent sources—as in a double-slit experiment with a 5 l—we call the
a ! pa
l  sin u.
