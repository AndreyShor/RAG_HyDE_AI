Figure 21-37 shows four iden-
tical conducting spheres that are actu-
ally well separated from one another.
Sphere W (with an initial charge of
zero) is touched to sphere A and then
they are separated. Next, sphere W is
touched to sphere B (with an initial
charge of %32e) and then they are separated. Finally, sphere W is
touched to sphere C (with an initial charge of #48e), and then they
are separated. The final charge on sphere W is #18e. What was the
initial charge on sphere A?

and y4 ! 5.00 cm. Particles 1 and 3, of charge %e, can be moved
along the x axis. Particle 5, of charge #e, is fixed at the origin.
Initially particle 1 is at x1 ! %10.0 cm and particle 3 is at x3 ! 10.0
cm. (a) To what x value must particle 1 be moved to rotate the
direction of the net electric force 
on particle 5 by 30" counter-
clockwise? (b) With particle 1 fixed at its new position, to what x
value must you move particle 3 to rotate 
back to its original
direction?

In Fig.21-26,particles 1 and 2 are fixed in place on an x axis,at a
separation of L ! 8.00 cm.Their charges are q1 ! #e and q2 ! %27e.
Particle 3 with charge q3 ! #4e is to be placed on the line between
particles 1 and 2,so that they produce a net electrostatic force 
on
it. (a) At what coordinate should particle 3 be placed to minimize the
magnitude of that force? (b) What is that minimum magnitude?

Earth’s atmosphere is constantly bombarded by cosmic
ray protons that originate somewhere in space. If the protons all
passed through the atmosphere, each square meter of Earth’s sur-
face would intercept protons at the average rate of 1500 protons
per second. What would be the electric current intercepted by the
total surface area of the planet?

Figure 21-34a shows charged particles 1 and 2 that are
fixed in place on an x axis. Particle 1 has a charge with a magnitude
of |q1| ! 8.00e. Particle 3 of charge q3 ! #8.00e is initially on the x
axis near particle 2.Then particle 3 is gradually moved in the posi-
tive direction of the x axis. As a result, the magnitude of the net
electrostatic force 
on particle 2 due to particles 1 and 3
changes. Figure 21-34b gives the x component of that net force as a
function of the position x of particle 3.The scale of the x axis is set
by xs ! 0.80 m.The plot has an asymptote of F2,net ! 1.5 $ 10 %25 N
as x : &. As a multiple of e and including the sign, what is the
charge q2 of particle 2?

electrons 1 and 2 on an x axis

tical charge %q and at identical
angles u. Electron 2 is free to
move; the other three particles
are fixed in place at horizontal
distances R from electron 2 and
are intended to hold electron 2 in
place. For physically possible val-
The Cs# ions are each deficient by one electron (and thus each has
a charge of #e), and the Cl% ion has one excess electron (and thus
has a charge of %e). (a) What is the magnitude of the net electro-
static force exerted on the Cl% ion by the eight Cs# ions at the cor-
ners of the cube? (b) If one of the Cs# ions is missing, the crystal is
said to have a defect; what is the magnitude of the net electrostatic
force exerted on the Cl% ion by the seven remaining Cs# ions?
