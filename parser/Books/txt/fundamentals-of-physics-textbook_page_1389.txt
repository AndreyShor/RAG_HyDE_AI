Observations of neutrinos emitted by the supernova
SN1987a (Fig. 43-12b) place an upper limit of 20 eV on the rest en-
ergy of the electron neutrino. If the rest energy of the electron neu-
trino were, in fact, 20 eV, what would be the speed difference
between light and a 1.5 MeV electron neutrino?

A neutral pion has a rest energy of 135 MeV and a mean

of 80 MeV and decays after one mean lifetime, what is the longest
possible track this particle could leave in a bubble chamber? Use
relativistic time dilation.

Certain theories predict that the proton is unstable,with a half-life

proton decays you would expect to occur in one year in the water of
an Olympic-sized swimming pool holding 4.32 " 105 L of water.

The rest energy of many short-lived particles cannot be mea-
