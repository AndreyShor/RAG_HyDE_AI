78  GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY 
able  in  this  way.  Even  though  by  no  means  all  gravita 
tional  fields  can  be  produced  in  this  way,  yet  we  may 
entertain  the  hope  that  the  general  law  of  gravitation 
will  be  derivable  from  such  gravitational  fields  of  a 
special  kind.  This  hope  has  been  realised  in  the  most 
beautiful  manner.  But  between  the  clear  vision  of 
this  goal  and  its  actual  realisation  it  was  necessary  to 
surmount  a  serious  difficulty,  and  as  this  lies  deep  at 
the  root  of  things,  I  dare  not  withhold  it  from  the  reader. 
We  require  to  extend  our  ideas  of  the  space-time  con 
tinuum  still  farther.
