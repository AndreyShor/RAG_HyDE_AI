CHAPTER 24
ELECTRIC POTENTIAL
electric potential is a scalar, the orientations of the electrons
do not matter. (2) The electric field at C is a vector quantity
and thus the orientation of the electrons is important.
Calculations: Because the electrons all have the same nega-
tive charge 'e and are all the same distance R from C, Eq.
24-27 gives us
(Answer)
(24-28)
Because of the symmetry of the arrangement in Fig. 24-12a,
the electric field vector at C due to any given electron is
canceled by the field vector due to the electron that is dia-
metrically opposite it.Thus, at C,
(Answer)
(b) The electrons are moved along the circle until they are
nonuniformly spaced over a 120% arc (Fig. 24-12b).At C, find
the electric potential and describe the electric field.
Reasoning: The potential is still given by Eq. 24-28, because
the distance between C and each electron is unchanged and
orientation is irrelevant. The electric field is no longer zero,
however, because the arrangement is no longer symmetric.
A net field is now directed toward the charge distribution.

Potential is not a vector, orientation is irrelevant
(a) In Fig. 24-12a, 12 electrons (of charge 
e) are equally
spaced and fixed around a circle of radius R. Relative to 
V $ 0 at infinity, what are the electric potential and electric
field at the center C of the circle due to these electrons?
KEY IDEAS
(1) The electric potential V at C is the algebraic sum of the
electric potentials contributed by all the electrons. Because

(Because electric potential is a scalar, the orientations of the
particles do not matter.)

The distance r is

charges is
Thus,
(Answer)
Close to any of the three positively charged particles in
Fig. 24-11a, the potential has very large positive values.
Close to the single negative charge, the potential has very
large negative values.Therefore, there must be points within
the square that have the same intermediate potential as that
at point P.The curve in Fig. 24-11b shows the intersection of
the plane of the figure with the equipotential surface that
contains point P.
