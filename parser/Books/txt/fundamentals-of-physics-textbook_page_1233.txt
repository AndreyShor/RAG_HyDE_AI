These are the lowest
six allowed energies
of the hydrogen atom.
The Balmer series
of wavelengths
are jumps up from
n = 2 (absorption)
or down to n = 2
(emission).
The Paschen series
of wavelengths
are jumps up from
n = 3 (absorption)
or down to n = 3
(emission).
The Lyman series
of wavelengths
are jumps up from
n = 1 (absorption)
or down to n = 1
(emission).
This is the
shortest
Balmer
(series limit).
λ
This is the
longest
Balmer
(red).

Figure 39-18 (a) An energy-level diagram for the hydrogen atom.Some of the transitions for (b) the Lyman series,(c) the Balmer
series,and (d) the Paschen series.For each,the longest four wavelengths and the series-limit wavelength are plotted on a
wavelength axis.Any wavelength shorter than the series-limit wavelength is allowed.
