THE  BEHAVIOUR   OF   MEASURING-RODS  AND 
CLOCKS  IN  MOTION 
I  
PLACE  a  metre-rod  in  the  A;'  -axis  of  K'  in  such  a 
manner  that  one  end  (the  beginning)  coincides  with 
the  point  x'=o,  whilst  the  other  end  (the  end  of  the 
rod)  coincides  with  the  point  x'=i.     What  is  the  length 
of  the  metre-rod  relatively  to  the  system  K  ?     In  order 
to  learn  this,  we  need  only  ask  where  the  beginning  of  the 
rod  and  the  end  of  the  rod  lie  with  respect  to  K  at  a 
particular  time  i  of  the  system  K.     By  means  of  the  first 
equation  of  the  Lorentz  transformation  the  values  of 
these  two  points  at  the  time  t=o  can  be  shown  to  be

the  metre-rod  is  moving  with  the  velocity  v  relative  to 
K.  It  therefore  follows  that  the  length  of  a  rigid  metre- 
rod  moving  in  the  direction  of  its  length  with  a  velocity 
v  is  »Ji  —  v2/cz  of  a  metre.  The  rigid  rod  is  thus 
shorter  when  in  motion  than  when  at  rest,  and  the 
more  quickly  it  is  moving,  the  shorter  is  the  rod.  For 
the  velocity  v—c  we  should  have  v/i-v2/c2=o,  and 
for  still  greater  velocities  the  square-root  becomes
