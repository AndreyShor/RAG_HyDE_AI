THE  PRINCIPLE  OF  RELATIVITY      15 
Now  in  virtue  of  its  motion  in  an  orbit  round  the  sun, 
our  earth  is  comparable  with  a  railway  carriage  travel 
ling  with  a  velocity  of  about  30  kilometres  per  second. 
If  the  principle  of  relativity  were  not  valid  we  should 
therefore  expect  that  the  direction  of  motion  of  the 
earth  at  any  moment  would  enter  into  the  laws  of  nature, 
and  also  that  physical  systems  in  their  behaviour  would 
be  dependent  on  the  orientation  in  space  with  respect 
to  the  earth.  For  owing  to  the  alteration  in  direction 
of  the  velocity  of  revolution  of  the  earth  in  the  course 
of  a  year,  the  earth  cannot  be  at  rest  relative  to  the 
hypothetical  system  K0  throughout  the  whole  year. 
However,  the  most  careful  observations  have  never 
revealed  such  anisotropic  properties  in  terrestrial  physi 
cal  space,  i.e.  a  physical  non-equivalence  of  different 
directions.  This  is  very  powerful  argument  in  favour 
of  the  principle  of  relativity.
