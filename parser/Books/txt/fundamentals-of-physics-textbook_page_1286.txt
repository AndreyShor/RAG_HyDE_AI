Figure 41-8 (a) The density of occupied states No(E) for copper at absolute zero.The area under the curve is the number density of electrons n.
Note that all states with energies up to the Fermi energy EF ! 7 eV are occupied,and all those with energies above the Fermi energy are vacant.
(b) The same for copper at T ! 1000 K.Note that only electrons with energies near the Fermi energy have been affected and redistributed.
bility for absolute zero (Fig. 41-7a). The result is Fig. 41-8a. Figure 41-8b shows
the density of occupied states  at T ! 1000 K.
Next, we write

Sample Problem 41.05
Number of occupied states in an energy range in a metal
A lump of copper (Fermi energy
7.0 eV) has volume 
2 
10#9 m3. How  many occupied states per eV lie in a nar-
row energy range around 7.0 eV?
KEY IDEAS
(1) First we want the density of occupied states No(E) as
given by Eq. 41-7 (No(E) ! N(E) P(E)). (2) Because we
want to evaluate quantities for a narrow energy range
around 7.0 eV (the Fermi energy for copper), the occupancy
probability P(E) is 0.50.
Calculations: From Fig. 41-6, we see that the density of
states at 7 eV is about 1.8 " 10 28 m#3 eV#1. Thus, Eq. 41-7
tells us that the density of occupied states is
