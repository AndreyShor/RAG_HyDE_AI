final points on a p-V diagram for the two gases. Which path goes
with which process? (e) Are the molecules of the diatomic gas ro-
tating?

The dot in Fig. 19-18b represents the initial state of a gas, and
the isotherm through the dot divides the p-V diagram into regions
1 and 2. For the following processes, determine whether the change
%Eint in the internal energy of the gas is positive, negative, or zero:
(a) the gas moves up along the isotherm, (b) it moves down along
the isotherm, (c) it moves to anywhere in region 1, and (d) it moves
to anywhere in region 2.
7
(a) Rank the four paths of Fig. 19-16 according to the work
done by the gas, greatest first. (b) Rank paths 1, 2, and 3 according
to the change in the internal energy of the gas, most positive first
and most negative last.

The dot in Fig. 19-18c represents the initial state of a gas, and
the adiabat through the dot divides the p-V diagram into regions
1 and 2. For the following processes, determine whether the cor-
responding heat Q is positive, negative, or zero: (a) the gas
moves up along the adiabat, (b) it moves down along the adia-
bat, (c) it moves to anywhere in region 1, and (d) it moves to
anywhere in region 2.

An ideal diatomic gas, with molecular rotation but without any
molecular oscillation, loses a certain amount of energy as heat Q.
Is the resulting decrease in the internal energy of the gas greater if
the loss occurs in a constant-volume process or in a constant-pres-
sure process?
10
Does the temperature of an ideal gas increase, decrease,
or stay the same during (a) an isothermal expansion, (b) an expan-
sion at constant pressure, (c) an adiabatic expansion, and (d) an
increase in pressure at constant volume?

Water bottle in a hot car. In the American Southwest, the
temperature in a closed car parked in sunlight during the summer
can be high enough to burn flesh. Suppose a bottle of water at a re-
frigerator temperature of 5.00-C is opened, then closed, and then
left in a closed car with an internal temperature of 75.0-C.
Neglecting the thermal expansion of the water and the bottle, find
the pressure in the air pocket trapped in the bottle. (The pressure
can be enough to push the bottle cap past the threads that are in-
tended to keep the bottle closed.)

pression, and (b) is the transfer to or from the gas?
