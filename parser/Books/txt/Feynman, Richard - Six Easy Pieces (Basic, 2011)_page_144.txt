years we have discovered that all mass is made of tiny particles and
that there are several kinds of interactions, such as nuclear forces,
etc. None of these nuclear or electrical forces has yet been found
to explain gravitation. The quantum-mechanical aspects of nature
have not yet been carried over to gravitation. When the scale is so
small that we need the quantum effects, the gravitational effects are
so weak that the need for a quantum theory of gravitation has not
yet developed. On the other hand, for consistency in our physical
theories it would be important to see whether Newton’s law mod-
iﬁed to Einstein’s law can be further modiﬁed to be consistent with
the uncertainty principle. This last modiﬁcation has not yet been
completed.
