Displacement is an example of a vector quantity, which is a quantity that has
both a direction and a magnitude.We explore vectors more fully in Chapter 3, but
here all we need is the idea that displacement has two features: (1) Its magnitude
is the distance (such as the number of meters) between the original and final po-
sitions. (2) Its direction, from an original position to a final position, can be repre-
sented by a plus sign or a minus sign if the motion is along a single axis.
Here is the first of many checkpoints where you can check your understanding
with a bit of reasoning. The answers are in the back of the book.

2-1 POSITION, DISPLACEMENT, AND AVERAGE VELOCITY
Checkpoint 1
Here are three pairs of initial and final positions, respectively, along an x axis.Which
pairs give a negative displacement: (a) $3 m, #5 m; (b) $3 m, $7 m; (c) 7 m, $3 m?
Average Velocity and Average Speed
A compact way to describe position is with a graph of position x plotted as a func-
tion of time t—a graph of x(t). (The notation x(t) represents a function x of t, not
the product x times t.) As a simple example, Fig. 2-2 shows the position function
x(t) for a stationary armadillo (which we treat as a particle) over a 7 s time inter-
val.The animal’s position stays at x " $2 m.
Figure 2-3 is more interesting, because it involves motion. The armadillo is
apparently first noticed at t " 0 when it is at the position x " $5 m. It moves
