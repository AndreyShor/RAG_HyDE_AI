REVIEW & SUMMARY
Angular Position
To describe the rotation of a rigid body about
a fixed axis, called the rotation axis, we assume a reference line is
fixed in the body, perpendicular to that axis and rotating with the
body.We measure the angular position u of this line relative to a fixed
direction.When u is measured in radians,
(radian measure),
(10-1)
where s is the arc length of a circular path of radius r and angle u.
Radian measure is related to angle measure in revolutions and de-
grees by
1 rev ! 360# ! 2p rad.

Angular Displacement
A body that rotates about a rotation
axis, changing its angular position from u1 to u2, undergoes an angu-
lar displacement
"u ! u2 % u1,
(10-4)
where "u is positive for counterclockwise rotation and negative for
clockwise rotation.
Angular Velocity and Speed
If a body rotates through an
angular displacement "u in a time interval "t, its average angular
velocity vavg is
(10-5)
The (instantaneous) angular velocity v of the body is
(10-6)
Both vavg and v are vectors, with directions given by the right-hand
rule of Fig. 10-6. They are positive for counterclockwise rotation
and negative for clockwise rotation. The magnitude of the body’s
angular velocity is the angular speed.
Angular Acceleration
If the angular velocity of a body
changes from v1 to v2 in a time interval "t ! t2 % t1, the average
angular acceleration aavg of the body is
(10-7)
The (instantaneous) angular acceleration a of the body is
(10-8)
Both aavg and a are vectors.
The Kinematic Equations for Constant Angular Accel-
eration
Constant angular acceleration (a ! constant) is an im-
portant special case of rotational motion. The appropriate kine-
matic equations, given in Table 10-1, are

Review & Summary
moves in a circle with radius r. If the body rotates through an angle u,
the point moves along an arc with length s given by
s ! ur
(radian measure),
(10-17)
where u is in radians.
The linear velocity 
of the point is tangent to the circle; the
point’s linear speed v is given by
v ! vr
(radian measure),
(10-18)
where v is the angular speed (in radians per second) of the body.
The linear acceleration 
of the point has both tangential and
radial components.The tangential component is
at ! ar
(radian measure),
(10-22)
where a is the magnitude of the angular acceleration (in radians
per second-squared) of the body.The radial component of 
is
(radian measure).
(10-23)
If the point moves in uniform circular motion, the period T of
the motion for the point and the body is
(radian measure).

Rotational Kinetic Energy and Rotational Inertia
The ki-
netic energy K of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by
(radian measure),
(10-34)
in which I is the rotational inertia of the body, defined as
(10-33)
for a system of discrete particles and defined as
(10-35)
for a body with continuously distributed mass. The r and ri in these
expressions represent the perpendicular distance from the axis of
rotation to each mass element in the body, and the integration is car-
ried out over the entire body so as to include every mass element.
The Parallel-Axis Theorem
The parallel-axis theorem relates
the rotational inertia I of a body about any axis to that of the same
body about a parallel axis through the center of mass:
I ! Icom & Mh2.
(10-36)
Here h is the perpendicular distance between the two axes, and
Icom is the rotational inertia of the body about the axis through the
com. We can describe h as being the distance the actual rotation
axis has been shifted from the rotation axis through the com.
Torque
Torque is a turning or twisting action on a body about a ro-
tation axis due to a force 
. If 
is exerted at a point given by the po-
sition vector 
relative to the axis, then the magnitude of the torque is
(10-40, 10-41, 10-39)
where Ft is the component of 
perpendicular to 
and f is the an-
gle between 
and 
.The quantity 
is the perpendicular distance
between the rotation axis and an extended line running through
the 
vector. This line is called the line of action of 
, and 
is
called the moment arm of 
. Similarly, r is the moment arm of Ft.
