around the rectangle.
Faraday’s Law. Let us now apply Faraday’s law of induction,
(33-6)
counterclockwise around the rectangle of Fig. 33-6. There is no contribution to
the integral from the top or bottom of the rectangle because 
and 
are per-
pendicular to each other there.The integral then has the value
(33-7)
The flux #B through this rectangle is
#B ! (B)(h dx),
(33-8)
where B is the average magnitude of 
within the rectangle and h dx is the area
of the rectangle. Differentiating Eq. 33-8 with respect to t gives
(33-9)
If we substitute Eqs. 33-7 and 33-9 into Eq. 33-6, we find
or
(33-10)
Actually, both B and E are functions of two variables, coordinate x and time t, as
Eqs. 33-1 and 33-2 show. However, in evaluating dE/dx, we must assume that t is
constant because Fig. 33-6 is an “instantaneous snapshot.” Also, in evaluating
dB/dt we must assume that x is constant (a particular value) because we are deal-
ing with the time rate of change of B at a particular place, the point P shown in
Fig. 33-5b. The derivatives under these circumstances are partial derivatives, and
Eq. 33-10 must be written
(33-11)
The minus sign in this equation is appropriate and necessary because, although
magnitude E is increasing with x at the site of the rectangle in Fig. 33-6, magni-
tude B is decreasing with t.
From Eq. 33-1 we have
and from Eq. 33-2
Then Eq. 33-11 reduces to
kEm cos(kx ' vt) ! vBm cos(kx ' vt).
(33-12)
The ratio v/k for a traveling wave is its speed, which we are calling c. Equation
33-12 then becomes
(amplitude ratio),
(33-13)
which is just Eq. 33-4.
