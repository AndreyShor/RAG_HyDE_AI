2L is shown on the second line in Table 35-1.) If the waves of r1 and r2 are to be
exactly in phase so that they produce fully constructive interference, the path
length 2L must cause an additional phase difference of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, . . . wave-
lengths. Only then will the net phase difference be an integer number of wave-
lengths.Thus, for a bright film, we must have
(in-phase waves).
(35-31)
The wavelength we need here is the wavelength ln2 of the light in the medium
containing path length 2L—that is, in the medium with index of refraction n2.
Thus, we can rewrite Eq. 35-31 as
(in-phase waves).
(35-32)
If, instead, the waves are to be exactly out of phase so that there is fully
destructive interference, the path length 2L must cause either no additional
phase difference or a phase difference of 1, 2, 3, . . . wavelengths. Only then will
the net phase difference be an odd number of half-wavelengths. For a dark film,
we must have
2L ! integer ( wavelength
(out-of-phase waves).
(35-33)
where, again, the wavelength is the wavelength ln2 in the medium containing 2L.
Thus, this time we have
2L ! integer ( ln2
(out-of-phase waves).
(35-34)
Now we can use Eq. 35-6 (ln ! l/n) to write the wavelength of the wave of ray r2
inside the film as
(35-35)
where l is the wavelength of the incident light in vacuum (and approximately
also in air). Substituting Eq. 35-35 into Eq. 35-32 and replacing “odd number/2”
with 
give us
(maxima—bright film in air).
(35-36)
Similarly, with m replacing “integer,” Eq. 35-34 yields
(minima—dark film in air).
(35-37)
For a given film thickness L, Eqs. 35-36 and 35-37 tell us the wavelengths of
light for which the film appears bright and dark, respectively, one wavelength for
each value of m. Intermediate wavelengths give intermediate brightnesses. For a
given wavelength l, Eqs. 35-36 and 35-37 tell us the thicknesses of the films that
appear bright and dark in that light, respectively, one thickness for each value of
m. Intermediate thicknesses give intermediate brightnesses.
Heads Up. (1) For a thin film surrounded by air, Eq. 35-36 corresponds to
bright reflections and Eq. 35-37 corresponds to no reflections. For transmissions,
the roles of the equations are reversed (after all, if the light is brightly reflected,
then it is not transmitted, and vice versa). (2) If we have a different set of values
of the indexes of refraction, the roles of the equations may be reversed. For any
given set of indexes, you must go through the thought process behind Table 35-1
and, in particular, determine the reflection shifts to see which equation applies to
bright reflections and which applies to no reflections. (3) The index of refraction
in the equations is that of the thin film, where the path length difference occurs.
