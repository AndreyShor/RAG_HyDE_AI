CHAPTER 31
ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS AND ALTERNATING CURRENT
An Inductive Load
Figure 31-12 shows a circuit containing an inductance and a generator with the al-
ternating emf of Eq. 31-28. Using the loop rule and proceeding as we did to
obtain Eq. 31-30, we find that the potential difference across the inductance is
vL ! VL sin vdt,
(31-45)
KEY IDEA
In an ac circuit with a purely capacitive load, the alternating
current iC(t) in the capacitance leads the alternating poten-
tial difference vC(t) by 90+; that is, the phase constant f for
the current is '90°, or 'p/2 rad.
Calculations: Thus, we can write Eq. 31-29 as
iC ! IC sin(vdt ' f) ! IC sin(vdt $ p/2).
(31-44)
We can find the amplitude IC from Eq. 31-42 (VC ! ICXC) if
we first find the capacitive reactance XC. From Eq. 31-39
(XC ! 1/vdC), with vd ! 2pfd, we can write
Then Eq. 31-42 tells us that the current amplitude is
(Answer)
Substituting this and vd ! 2pfd ! 120p into Eq. 31-44, we
have
iC ! (0.203 A) sin(120pt $ p/2).

Sample Problem 31.04
Purely capacitive load: potential difference and current 
In Fig. 31-10, capacitance C is 15.0 mF and the sinusoidal 
alternating emf device operates at amplitude #m ! 36.0 V
and frequency fd ! 60.0 Hz.
(a) What are the potential difference vC(t) across the 
capacitance and the amplitude VC of vC(t)?
KEY IDEA
In a circuit with a purely capacitive load, the potential dif-
ference vC(t) across the capacitance is always equal to the
potential difference #(t) across the emf device.
Calculations: Here we have vC(t) ! #(t) and VC ! #m.
Since #m is given, we have
VC ! #m ! 36.0 V.
(Answer)
To find vC(t), we use Eq. 31-28 to write
vC(t) ! #(t) ! #m sin vdt.
(31-43)
Then, substituting #m ! 36.0 V and vd ! 2pfd ! 120p into
Eq. 31-43, we have
vC ! (36.0 V) sin(120pt).
(Answer)
(b) What are the current iC(t) in the circuit as a function of
time and the amplitude IC of iC(t)?

Figure 31-12 An inductor is connected across
an alternating-current generator.
This relation between iC and vC is illustrated by the phasor diagram of
Fig. 31-11b.As the phasors representing these two quantities rotate counterclock-
wise together, the phasor labeled IC does indeed lead that labeled VC, and by an
angle of 90°; that is, the phasor IC coincides with the vertical axis one-quarter
cycle before the phasor VC does. Be sure to convince yourself that the phasor
diagram of Fig. 31-11b is consistent with Eqs. 31-36 and 31-40.
Checkpoint 4
The figure shows, in (a), a sine curve S(t) ! sin(vdt) and three
other sinusoidal curves A(t), B(t), and C(t), each of the form
sin(vdt ' f). (a) Rank the three other curves according to the
value of f, most positive first and most negative last. (b) Which
curve corresponds to which phasor in (b) of the figure? (c)
