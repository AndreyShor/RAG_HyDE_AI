available as an animation with voiceover.
(it is the horizontal dashed line shown in Fig. 12-7c). Then r"
is the perpendicular distance between O and the line of ac-
tion. In Fig. 12-7c, r" extends along the y axis and is equal to
the height h.We similarly draw lines of action for the gravita-
tional force vectors 
and 
and see that their moment
arms extend along the x axis. For the distance a shown in Fig.
12-7a, the moment arms are a/2 (the firefighter is halfway up
the ladder) and a/3 (the ladderâ€™s center of mass is one-third of
the way up the ladder),respectively.The moment arms for 
and 
are zero because the forces act at the origin.

Then Eq. 12-21 gives us
! 407 N % 410 N.
(Answer)
Now we need to use the force balancing equations and
Fig. 12-7d.The equation Fnet,x ! 0 gives us
Fw % Fpx ! 0,
so
Fpx ! Fw ! 410 N.
(Answer)
The equation Fnet,y ! 0 gives us
Fpy % Mg % mg ! 0,
so
Fpy ! (M # m)g ! (72 kg # 45 kg)(9.8 m/s2)
! 1146.6 N % 1100 N.
(Answer)
! (9.8 m/s2)(7.58 m)(72/2 kg # 45/3 kg)
9.3 m
Fw ! ga(M/2 # m/3)

Now, with torques written in the form r"F, the balancing
equation tnet,z ! 0 becomes
%(h)(Fw) # (a/2)(Mg) # (a/3)(mg)
# (0)(Fpx) # (0)(Fpy) ! 0.

(A positive torque corresponds to counterclockwise rotation
and a negative torque corresponds to clockwise rotation.)
Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle
made by the ladder in Fig. 11-7a, we find that

Choosing the 
rotation axis
here eliminates
the torques
due to these 
forces.
This moment
arm is
perpendicular
to the
line of action.
These horizontal
forces balance.
