AVERAGE ACCELERATION AND INSTANTANEOUS ACCELERATION
Sample Problem 4.03 Two-dimensional acceleration, rabbit run
Additional examples, video, and practice available at WileyPLUS
For the rabbit in the preceding two sample problems, find
the acceleration 
at time t " 15 s.
KEY IDEA
We can find 
by taking derivatives of the rabbit’s velocity
components.
Calculations: Applying the ax part of Eq. 4-18 to Eq. 4-13,
we find the x component of 
to be
Similarly, applying the ay part of Eq. 4-18 to Eq. 4-14 yields
the y component as
We see that the acceleration does not vary with time (it is a
constant) because the time variable t does not appear in the
expression for either acceleration component. Equation 4-17
then yields
(Answer)
which is superimposed on the rabbit’s path in Fig. 4-7.
To get the magnitude and angle of , either we use a
vector-capable calculator or we follow Eq. 3-6. For the mag-
nitude we have
(Answer)
For the angle we have
However, this angle, which is the one displayed on a calcula-
tor, indicates that 
is directed to the right and downward in
Fig. 4-7. Yet, we know from the components that 
must be
directed to the left and upward. To find the other angle that

(Answer)
This is consistent with the components of 
because it gives 
a vector that is to the left and upward. Note that 
has the
same magnitude and direction throughout the rabbit’s run
because the acceleration is constant. That means that
we could draw the very same vector at any other point
along the rabbit’s path (just shift the vector to put its tail at
some other point on the path without changing the length
or orientation).
This has been the second sample problem in which we
needed to take the derivative of a vector that is written in
unit-vector notation.One common error is to neglect the unit
vectors themselves, with a result of only a set of numbers and
symbols. Keep in mind that a derivative of a vector is always
another vector.

Checkpoint 2
Here are four descriptions of the position (in meters) of a puck as it moves in an xy plane:
(1) x " $3t 2 # 4t $ 2
and
y " 6t 2 $ 4t (3)
(2) x " $3t 3 $ 4t
and
y " $5t 2 # 6
(4)
Are the x and y acceleration components constant? Is  acceleration 
constant?
