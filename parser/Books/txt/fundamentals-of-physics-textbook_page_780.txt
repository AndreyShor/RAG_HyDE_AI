As we have done several times in other connections, we often wish to take a
general view and deal not with particular objects but with materials. Here we do
so by focusing not on the potential difference V across a particular resistor but on
the electric field 
at a point in a resistive material. Instead of dealing with the
current i through the resistor, we deal with the current density 
at the point in
question. Instead of the resistance R of an object, we deal with the resistivity r of
the material:
(definition of r).
(26-10)
(Compare this equation with Eq. 26-8.)
If we combine the SI units of E and J according to Eq. 26-10, we get, for the
unit of r, the ohm-meter (0&m):
(Do not confuse the ohm-meter, the unit of resistivity, with the ohmmeter, which
is an instrument that measures resistance.) Table 26-1 lists the resistivities of
some materials.
We can write Eq. 26-10 in vector form as
(26-11)
Equations 26-10 and 26-11 hold only for isotropic materialsâ€”materials whose
electrical properties are the same in all directions.
We often speak of the conductivity s of a material.This is simply the recipro-
cal of its resistivity, so
(definition of s).
(26-12)
The SI unit of conductivity is the reciprocal ohm-meter, (0&m)#1. The unit name
mhos per meter is sometimes used (mho is ohm backwards). The definition of s
allows us to write Eq. 26-11 in the alternative form
(26-13)

Resistance is a property of an object. Resistivity is a property of a material.
If we know the resistivity of a substance such as copper, we can calculate the
resistance of a length of wire made of that substance. Let A be the cross-sectional
area of the wire, let L be its length, and let a potential difference V exist between
its ends (Fig. 26-9). If the streamlines representing the current density are
uniform throughout the wire, the electric field and the current density will
be constant for all points within the wire and, from Eqs. 24-42 and 26-5, will have
the values
E ! V/L
and
J ! i/A.
(26-14)
We can then combine Eqs. 26-10 and 26-14 to write
