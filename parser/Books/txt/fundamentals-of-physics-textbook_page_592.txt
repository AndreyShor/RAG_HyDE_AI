temperature. (For now we neglect the possibility of also putting energy into oscil-
lations of the molecules.)
We can now generalize Eq. 19-38 for the internal energy of any ideal gas by
substituting CV for R; we get
Eint # nCVT
(any ideal gas).
(19-44)
This equation applies not only to an ideal monatomic gas but also to diatomic
and polyatomic ideal gases, provided the appropriate value of CV is used. Just as
with Eq. 19-38, we see that the internal energy of a gas depends on the temper-
ature of the gas but not on its pressure or density.
When a confined ideal gas undergoes temperature change %T, then from ei-
ther Eq. 19-41 or Eq. 19-44 the resulting change in its internal energy is
%Eint # nCV %T
(ideal gas, any process).
(19-45)
This equation tells us:

different processes that take an ideal gas

The change %Eint in the internal energy

processes and for any others that result in
the same change of temperature.

The paths are different,
but the change in the
internal energy is the
same.
A change in the internal energy Eint of a confined ideal gas depends on only the
change in the temperature, not on what type of process produces the change.
As examples, consider the three paths between the two isotherms in the p-V
diagram of Fig. 19-10. Path 1 represents a constant-volume process. Path 2
represents a constant-pressure process (we examine it next). Path 3 represents a
process in which no heat is exchanged with the system’s environment (we discuss
this in Module 19-9). Although the values of heat Q and work W associated with
these three paths differ, as do pf and Vf, the values of %Eint associated with the
three paths are identical and are all given by Eq. 19-45, because they all involve
the same temperature change %T. Therefore, no matter what path is actually
taken between T and T " %T, we can always use path 1 and Eq. 19-45 to compute
%Eint easily.
Molar Specific Heat at Constant Pressure
We now assume that the temperature of our ideal gas is increased by the same
small amount %T as previously but now the necessary energy (heat Q) is added
with the gas under constant pressure. An experiment for doing this is shown in
Fig. 19-11a; the p-V diagram for the process is plotted in Fig. 19-11b. From such
experiments we find that the heat Q is related to the temperature change %T by
Q # nCp %T
(constant pressure),
(19-46)
where Cp is a constant called the molar specific heat at constant pressure. This
Cp is greater than the molar specific heat at constant volume CV, because energy
must now be supplied not only to raise the temperature of the gas but also for
the gas to do work—that is, to lift the weighted piston of Fig. 19-11a.
To relate molar specific heats Cp and CV, we start with the first law of ther-
modynamics (Eq. 18-26):
%Eint # Q $ W.
(19-47)
We next replace each term in Eq. 19-47. For %Eint, we substitute from Eq. 19-45.
For Q, we substitute from Eq. 19-46. To replace W, we first note that since the
pressure remains constant, Eq. 19-16 tells us that W # p %V. Then we note that,
using the ideal gas equation (pV # nRT), we can write
W # p %V # nR %T.
(19-48)
Making these substitutions in Eq. 19-47 and then dividing through by n %T,
we find
