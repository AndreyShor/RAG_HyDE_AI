Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: Newton’s law of gravitation From his better understanding of the theory of motion, Newton appreciated that the sun could be the seat or organization of forces that govern the motion of the planets. Newton proved to himself (and perhaps we shall be able to prove it soon) that the very fact that equal areas are swept out in equal times is a precise signpost of the proposition that all deviations are precisely radial—that
the law of areas is a direct consequence of the idea that all of the forces are directed exactly toward the sun. Next, by analyzing Kepler’s third law it is possible to show that the farther away the planet, the weaker the forces. If two planets at different distances from the sun are compared, the analysis shows that the forces are inversely proportional to the squares of the re- spective distances. With the combination of the two laws, Newton concluded that there must be a force, inversely as
the square of the distance, directed in a line between the two objects. Being a man of considerable feeling for generalities, Newton supposed, of course, that this relationship applied more generally than just to the sun holding the planets. It was already known, for example, that the planet Jupiter had moons going around it as the moon of the earth goes around the earth, and Newton felt certain that each planet held its moons with a force. He already knew of the force holding us on the earth,
so he proposed that this was a universal force—that everything pulls everything else. The next problem was whether the pull of the earth on its people was the “same” as its pull on the moon, i.e., inversely as the square of the distance. If an object on the surface of the earth falls 16 feet in the ﬁrst second after it is released from rest, how far does the moon fall in the same time? We might say that the moon does not fall at all. But if there were no force on the moon, it would go off in a
straight line, whereas it goes in a circle instead, so it really falls in from where it would have been if there were no force at all. We can calculate from the radius of the moon’s orbit (which is about 240,000 miles) and how long it takes to go around the earth (ap- 94 Six Easy Pieces

In such a system, the sun, or the common centre of gravity, lies in one of the foci of the orbital ellipse in such a manner that, in the course of a planet-year, the distance sun-planet grows from a minimum to a maximum, and then decreases again to a minimum. If
instead of Newton's law we insert a somewhat different law of attraction into the calcula tion, we find that, according to this new law, the motion would still take place in such a manner that the distance sun-planet exhibits periodic variations ; but in this case the angle described by the line joining sun and planet during such a period (from perihelion — closest proximity to the sun — to perihelion) would differ from 360°. The line of the orbit would not then be a closed one, but in the
course of time it would fill up an annular part of the orbital plane, viz. between the circle of least and the circle of greatest distance of the planet from the sun. According also to the general theory of relativity, which differs of course from the theory of Newton, a small variation from the Newton-Kepler motion of a planet in its orbit should take place, and in such a way, that the angle described by the radius sun-planet between one perihelion and the next should exceed that corresponding
to one complete revolution by an amount given by (N.B. — One complete revolution corresponds to the angle 2?,- in the absolute angular measure customary in physics, and the above expression gives the amount by

Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: 369 13-6 PLANETS AND SATELLITES: KEPLER’S LAWS Planets and Satellites: Kepler’s Laws The motions of the planets, as they seemingly wander against the background of the stars, have been a puzzle since the dawn of history. The “loop-the-loop” motion of Mars, shown in Fig. 13-11, was particularly baffling. Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), after a lifetime of study, worked out the empirical laws that govern these motions.
Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), the last of the great astronomers to make observations without the help of a telescope, compiled the extensive data from which Kepler was able to derive the three laws of planetary motion that now bear Kepler’s name. Later, Newton (1642–1727) showed that his law of gravitation leads to Kepler’s laws. In this section we discuss each of Kepler’s three laws. Although here we apply the laws to planets orbiting the Sun, they hold equally well for satellites, either natural or
artificial, orbiting Earth or any other massive central body. 1. THE LAW OF ORBITS:All planets move in elliptical orbits,with the Sun at one focus. Figure 13-12 shows a planet of mass m moving in such an orbit around the Sun, whose mass is M. We assume that so that the center of mass of the planet–Sun system is approximately at the center of the Sun. The orbit in Fig. 13-12 is described by giving its semimajor axis a and its eccentricity e, the latter defined so that ea is the distance from the
center of the ellipse to either focus F or F9. An eccentricity of zero corresponds to a circle, in which the two foci merge to a single central point.The eccentricities of the plane- tary orbits are not large; so if the orbits are drawn to scale, they look circular.The eccentricity of the ellipse of Fig. 13-12, which has been exaggerated for clarity, is 0.74.The eccentricity of Earth’s orbit is only 0.0167.

THE LAW OF AREAS: A line that connects a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in the plane of the planet’s orbit in equal time intervals; that is, the rate dA/dt at
which it sweeps out area A is constant. Figure 13-12 A planet of mass m moving in an elliptical orbit around the Sun.The Sun, of mass M, is at one focus F of the ellipse. The other focus is F9, which is located in empty space. The semimajor axis a of the ellipse, the perihelion (nearest the Sun) distance Rp, and the aphelion (farthest from the Sun) distance Ra are also shown. Ra Rp M m a ea ea F F' θ r The Sun is at one of the two focal points. Qualitatively, this second law tells us that the
planet will move most slowly when it is farthest from the Sun and most rapidly when it is nearest to the Sun. As it turns out, Kepler’s second law is totally equivalent to the law of conservation of angular momentum. Let us prove it. The area of the shaded wedge in Fig. 13-13a closely approximates the area swept out in time 't by a line connecting the Sun and the planet, which are separated by distance r. The area 'A of the wedge is approximately the area of Figure 13-13 (a) In time 't, the line

//////// System Response:

According to Newton’s law of gravitation, the primary force that keeps planets in orbit around the Sun is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Here's a breakdown of why this is the key concept: * **Newton's Law:** The law states that the gravitational force (which keeps planets in orbit) is proportional to the *product* of their masses. * **Inverse Square Relationship:** The crucial part is that this force is inversely proportional to the *square* of the distance.
This means if you double the distance between two objects, the gravitational force becomes four times weaker. Therefore, the primary force driving planetary orbits is a consequence of this inverse square relationship – a stronger gravitational pull at closer distances, and a weaker pull at greater distances.

Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: 1139 37-6 MOMENTUM AND ENERGY a tiny fraction of the total mass involved that there is no hope of measuring the mass change with even the best laboratory balances. Mass and energy truly seem to be separately conserved. However, in a nuclear reaction (in which nuclei or funda- mental particles interact),the energy released is often about a million times greater than in a chemical reaction,and the change in mass can
easily be measured. An object’s mass m and the equivalent energy E0 are related by E0 ! mc2, (37-43) which, without the subscript 0, is the best-known science equation of all time.This energy that is associated with the mass of an object is called mass energy or rest energy. The second name suggests that E0 is an energy that the object has even when it is at rest, simply because it has mass. (If you continue your study of physics beyond this book, you will see more refined discussions of the
relation between mass and energy. You might even encounter disagreements about just what that relation is and means.) Table 37-3 shows the (approximate) mass energy, or rest energy, of a few objects.The mass energy of, say, a U.S. penny is enormous; the equivalent amount of electrical energy would cost well over a million dollars. On the other hand, the entire annual U.S. electrical energy production corresponds to a mass of only a few hundred kilograms of matter (stones, burritos, or anything
else). In practice, SI units are rarely used with Eq. 37-43 because they are too large to be convenient. Masses are usually measured in atomic mass units, where 1 u ! 1.660 538 86 ( 10&27 kg, (37-44) and energies are usually measured in electron-volts or multiples of it, where 1 eV ! 1.602 176 462 ( 10&19 J.

the object’s mass m, regardless of whether the object is at rest or moving. If the object is moving, it has additional energy in the form of kinetic energy K. If we assume that the object’s potential energy is zero, then its total energy E is the sum of its mass energy and its kinetic energy: E ! E0 ' K ! mc 2 ' K. (37-47) Although we shall not prove it, the total energy E can also be written as E ! gmc2, (37-48) where g is the Lorentz factor for the object’s motion. ! 931.494 013 MeV/u. c2 !

2. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: 1140 CHAPTER 37 RELATIVITY Since Chapter 7, we have discussed many examples involving changes in the total energy of a particle or a system of particles. However, we did not in- clude mass energy in the discussions because the changes in mass energy were either zero or small enough to be neglected. The law of conservation of total energy still applies when changes in mass energy are significant. Thus, regard- less of
what happens to the mass energy, the following statement from Module 8-5 is still true: The total energy E of an isolated system cannot change. For example, if the total mass energy of two interacting particles in an isolated system decreases, some other type of energy in the system must increase because the total energy cannot change. Q Value. In a system undergoing a chemical or nuclear reaction, a change in the total mass energy of the system due to the reaction is often given as a Q value.
The Q value for a reaction is obtained from the relation or E0i ! E0f ' Q. (37-49) Using Eq. 37-43 (E0 ! mc2), we can rewrite this in terms of the initial total mass Mi and the final total mass Mf as Mi c2 ! Mf c2 ' Q or Q ! Mic2 & Mf c2 ! &2M c2, (37-50) where the change in mass due to the reaction is 2M ! Mf & Mi. If a reaction results in the transfer of energy from mass energy to, say, kinetic energy of the reaction products, the system’s total mass energy E0 (and total mass M) decreases and
Q is positive. If, instead, a reaction requires that energy be transferred to mass energy, the system’s total mass energy E0 (and its total mass M) increases and Q is negative. For example, suppose two hydrogen nuclei undergo a fusion reaction in which they join together to form a single nucleus and release two particles: where 2H is another type of hydrogen nucleus (with a neutron in addition to the proton), e+ is a positron, and v is a neutrino. The total mass energy (and total mass) of the
resultant single nucleus and two released particles is less than the total mass energy (and total mass) of the initial hydrogen nuclei.Thus, the Q of the fusion reaction is positive, and energy is said to be released (transferred from mass energy) by the reaction. This release is important to you because the fusion of hydrogen nuclei in the Sun is one part of the process that results in sunshine on Earth and makes life here possible. Kinetic Energy In Chapter 7 we defined the kinetic energy K of
an object of mass m moving at speed v well below c to be (37-51) However, this classical equation is only an approximation that is good enough when the speed is well below the speed of light. Let us now find an expression for kinetic energy that is correct for all physi- cally possible speeds, including speeds close to c. Solving Eq. 37-47 for K and then substituting for E from Eq. 37-48 lead to K ! 1 2mv2. 1H ' 1H : 2H ' e' ' v, # system’s initial total mass energy$ !# system’s final total mass

Einstein’s equation E = mc² signifies that **energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light squared (c²)**. Here's a breakdown of what this means: * **Mass and Energy are Interchangeable:** Einstein revolutionized our understanding by demonstrating that mass and energy are fundamentally different forms of the same thing. * **A Small Amount of Mass Can Be Released as Huge Amounts of Energy:** The speed of light (c) is a significant number. Therefore, even a tiny amount of mass
can be converted into an enormous amount of energy – this is what powers nuclear reactions and stars. Essentially, E = mc² tells us that mass isn't just 'stuff'; it’s a form of energy that has a very high potential for release.

0. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: To increase the color separation, we can use a solid glass prism with a trian- gular cross section, as in Fig. 33-20a.The dispersion at the first surface (on the left in Figs. 33-20a, b) is then enhanced by the dispersion at the second surface. Rainbows The most charming example of chromatic dispersion is a rainbow.When sunlight (which consists of all visible colors) is intercepted by a falling raindrop, some of the
light refracts into the drop, reflects once from the drop’s inner surface, and then refracts out of the drop. Figure 33-21a shows the situation when the Sun is on the horizon at the left (and thus when the rays of sunlight are horizontal).The first refraction separates the sunlight into its component colors, and the second refraction increases the separation. (Only the red and blue rays are shown in the figure.) If many falling drops are brightly illuminated, you can see the separated colors
they produce when the drops are at an angle of 42° from the direction of the antisolar point A, the point directly opposite the Sun in your view. To locate the drops, face away from the Sun and point both arms directly away from the Sun, toward the shadow of your head. Then move your right arm directly up, directly rightward, or in any intermediate direction until the angle between your arms is 42". If illuminated drops happen to be in the direction of your right arm, you see color in that
direction. Because any drop at an angle of 42" in any direction from A can contribute to the rainbow, the rainbow is always a 42" circular arc around A (Fig. 33-21b) and the top of a rainbow is never more than 42" above the horizon. When the Sun is above the horizon, the direction of A is below the horizon, and only a shorter, lower rainbow arc is possible (Fig. 33-21c). Because rainbows formed in this way involve one reflection of light inside each drop, they are often called primary rainbows.
A secondary rainbow involves two reflections inside a drop, as shown in Fig. 33-21d. Colors appear in the sec- ondary rainbow at an angle of 52" from the direction of A.

If you are lucky and look carefully below a primary rainbow, you can see dim- mer colored arcs called supernumeraries (Fig. 35-5). Like the main arcs of the rain- bow, the supernumeraries are due to waves that emerge from each drop approximately in phase with one another to give constructive
interference. If you are very lucky and look very carefully above a secondary rainbow, you might see even more (but even dimmer) supernumeraries. Keep in mind that both types of rainbows and both sets of supernumeraries are naturally occurring examples of op- tical interference and naturally occurring evidence that light consists of waves. 1052 CHAPTER 35 INTERFERENCE Thus, the phase difference of the emerging waves is 2.84 wave- lengths. Because 1.0 wavelength is equivalent to 2p rad and
360°,you can show that this phase difference is equivalent to phase difference ! 17.8 rad % 1020°. (Answer) The effective phase difference is the decimal part of the actual phase difference expressed in wavelengths. Thus, we have effective phase difference ! 0.84 wavelength. (Answer) You can show that this is equivalent to 5.3 rad and about 300°. Caution: We do not find the effective phase difference by taking the decimal part of the actual phase difference as expressed in radians or degrees.
For example, we do not take 0.8 rad from the actual phase difference of 17.8 rad. (b) If the waves reached the same point on a distant screen, what type of interference would they produce? Reasoning: We need to compare the effective phase differ- ence of the waves with the phase differences that give the extreme types of interference. Here the effective phase dif- ference of 0.84 wavelength is between 0.5 wavelength (for fully destructive interference, or the darkest possible result) and 1.0
wavelength (for fully constructive interference, or the brightest possible result), but closer to 1.0 wavelength. Thus, the waves would produce intermediate interference that is closer to fully constructive interference—they would produce a relatively bright spot. Sample Problem 35.01 Phase difference of two waves due to difference in refractive indexes In Fig. 35-4, the two light waves that are represented by the rays have wavelength 550.0 nm before entering media 1 and 2.They also have equal
amplitudes and are in phase. Medium 1 is now just air,and medium 2 is a transparent plastic layer of index of refraction 1.600 and thickness 2.600 mm. (a) What is the phase difference of the emerging waves in wavelengths, radians, and degrees? What is their effective phase difference (in wavelengths)? KEY IDEA The phase difference of two light waves can change if they travel through different media, with different indexes of refraction.The reason is that their wavelengths are different in the
different media.We can calculate the change in phase difference by counting the number of wavelengths that fits into each medium and then subtracting those numbers. Calculations: When the path lengths of the waves in the two media are identical, Eq. 35-9 gives the result of the subtrac- tion. Here we have n1 ! 1.000 (for the air), n2 ! 1.600, L ! 2.600 mm,and l ! 550.0 nm.Thus,Eq.35-9 yields (Answer) ! 2.84. ! 2.600 ( 10&6 m 5.500 ( 10&7 m (1.600 & 1.000) N2 & N1 !

//////// System Response:

Okay, let's break down why rainbows appear after rain. Here’s an explanation based on the provided text: **The Explanation:** Rainbows are formed due to a phenomenon called **refraction and reflection**. Here's how it works: 1. **Refraction:** Sunlight enters raindrops and bends (refracts) as it passes from air into water. This bending changes the direction of light rays. 2. **Reflection:** When sunlight hits the back surface of a raindrop, some of the light is reflected. 3. **Second
Refraction:** As the light exits the raindrop, it refracts again, further separating the colors. 4. **Angle of Emergence:** The crucial part is that each raindrop acts as a tiny prism. It selectively bends and reflects light in a specific way, causing the different colors to emerge at slightly different angles relative to each other. **The Angle of Minimum Deviation:** The text explains that the rainbow appears when the angle between the sunlight and the raindrops is approximately 42 degrees.
This is because the light rays are "bunching up" at this specific angle, creating the colorful arcs we see. It’s like a miniature, concentrated waterfall of colors. **In simpler terms:** The raindrops act like tiny prisms, splitting white light into its constituent colors and directing those colors towards our eyes. Let me know if you'd like more detail on any part of this explanation!

0. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle Our inability to predict the position of a particle with a uniform electric potential energy, as indicated by Fig. 38-13, is our first example of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, proposed in 1927 by German physicist Werner Heisenberg. It states that measured values cannot be assigned to the position and the momentum of a particle simultaneously with unlimited precision. In terms of
(called “h-bar”), the principle tells us (Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle). (38-28) Here )x and )px represent the intrinsic uncertainties in the measurements of the x components of and , with parallel meanings for the y and z terms. Even with the best measuring instruments, each product of a position uncertainty and a mo- mentum uncertainty in Eq. 38-28 will be greater than , never less. Here we shall not derive the uncertainty relationships but only apply them. They are due to the fact that
electrons and other particles are matter waves and that repeated measurements of their positions and momenta involve probabili- ties, not certainties. In the statistics of such measurements, we can view, say, )x and )px as the spread (actually, the standard deviations) in the measurements. We can also justify them with a physical (though highly simplified) argument: In earlier chapters we took for granted our ability to detect and measure location and motion, such as a car moving down a street
or a pool ball rolling across a table. We could locate a moving object by watching it—that is, by intercepting light scattered by the object. That scattering did not alter the object’s motion. In quantum physics, however, the act of detection in itself alters the location and motion.The more precisely we wish to determine the location of, say, an electron moving along an x axis (by using light or by any other means), the more we alter the electron’s momentum and thus become less certain of the

Doesn’t that mean that we have measured both px and x simultaneously and very precisely? No, the flaw is that although the first measurement can give us a precise value for px, the second measurement necessarily alters that value. Indeed, if the second measurement really does give us a precise value for

Such a random shift is just enough to smear out the pattern so that no interference is observed. The uncertainty principle “protects” quantum mechanics. Heisenberg recognized that if it were possible to measure the mo- mentum and the position simultaneously with a greater accuracy, the quantum mechanics would collapse. So
he proposed that it must be impossible. Then people sat down and tried to ﬁgure out ways of doing it, and nobody could ﬁgure out a way to measure the position and the momentum of anything—a screen, an elec- tron, a billiard ball, anything—with any greater accuracy. Quantum mechanics maintains its perilous but accurate existence. 138 Six Easy Pieces

Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: to land, we should ﬁnd P1 for those electrons that have chosen hole 1, P2 for those that have chosen hole 2, and necessarily the sum P1 + P2 for those that arrive through the two holes. There seems to be no way around this. But we have veriﬁed experimentally that that is not the case. And no one has ﬁgured a way out of this puzzle. So at the present time we must limit ourselves to computing probabilities. We say “at
the present time,” but we suspect very strongly that it is some- thing that will be with us forever—that it is impossible to beat that puzzle—that this is the way nature really is. The uncertainty principle This is the way Heisenberg stated the uncertainty principle origi- nally: If you make the measurement on any object, and you can determine the x-component of its momentum with an uncertainty Dp, you cannot, at the same time, know its x-position more accu- rately than . The uncertainties in
the position and mo- mentum at any instant must have their product greater than half the reduced Planck constant. This is a special case of the uncer- tainty principle that was stated above more generally. The more general statement was that one cannot design equipment in any way to determine which of two alternatives is taken, without, at the same time, destroying the pattern of interference. Let us show for one particular case that the kind of relation given by Heisenberg must be true in order

By watching the motion of the plate carefully we can try to tell which hole an electron goes through. Imagine what happens when the detector is placed at x = 0. We would expect that an electron which passes through hole 1 must be deﬂected downward by
the plate to reach the detector. Since the vertical com- ponent of the electron momentum is changed, the plate must recoil with an equal momentum in the opposite direction. The plate will / x p 2 ' $ D D 136 Six Easy Pieces

//////// System Response:

Okay, let's break down how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle affects our understanding of particles according to the provided text. Here’s a summary of how the text explains this impact: **1. It Challenges Classical Intuition:** The principle fundamentally challenges our classical notions about precise measurement. In classical physics, we can pinpoint an object’s position and momentum with high accuracy simultaneously – you know *exactly* where it is and *how fast* it’s moving. Quantum
mechanics introduces the uncertainty principle, which states that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely we can know both. **2. The Core Idea:** The principle says that if you try to measure one property (like position or momentum) with extreme accuracy, you inevitably lose information about the other property. The more accurately you determine one, the less accurately you can know the other. **3. It’s a Preventative Measure:** Heisenberg recognized this limitation as a safeguard. He
proposed that it's impossible to create an experiment that could simultaneously measure position and momentum with perfect accuracy. This is a crucial point – it *prevents* us from attempting such a feat. **4. The Implications for Quantum Mechanics:** The uncertainty principle isn’t just a quirk; it's a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. It’s deeply connected to the idea that quantum objects (like electrons) don’t have definite properties until they are measured. The act of measurement
fundamentally alters the system, leading to an inherent uncertainty. **In short:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle demonstrates that the very nature of quantum mechanics is built on this principle of limits – it forces us to accept that the world at the smallest scales isn't as straightforward and predictable as we might expect from classical physics. It emphasizes that knowledge is always incomplete, and accurate measurement comes at a cost. Do you want me to elaborate on any specific
aspect of this?

Photographs of the diffrac- tion patterns when the incident beam is (b) an x-ray beam (light wave) and (c) an electron beam (matter wave). Note that the two patterns are geometrically identical to each other. electrons were sent, one by one,
through a double-slit apparatus. The apparatus was like the ones we have previously used to demon- strate optical interference, except that the viewing screen was similar to an old-fashioned television screen. When an electron hit the screen,it caused a flash of light whose position was recorded. The first several electrons (top two photos) revealed nothing interesting and seemingly hit the screen at random points. However, after many thousands of electrons were sent through the apparatus, a
pattern appeared on the screen, revealing fringes where many electrons had hit the screen and fringes where few had hit the screen.The pattern is exactly what we would expect for wave interference. Thus, each electron passed through the appara- tus as a matter wave—the portion of the matter wave that trav- eled through one slit interfered with the portion that traveled through the other slit.That interference then determined the prob- ability that the electron would materialize at a given point
on the screen, hitting the screen there. Many electrons materialized in re- gions corresponding to bright fringes in optical interference, and few electrons materialized in regions corresponding to dark fringes. Similar interference has been demonstrated with protons, neutrons, and various atoms. In 1994, it was demonstrated with iodine molecules I2, which are not only 500 000 times more mas- sive than electrons but far more complex. In 1999, it was demon- strated with the even more complex
fullerenes (or buckyballs) C60 and C70. (Fullerenes are molecules of carbon atoms that are arranged in a structure resembling a soccer ball, 60 carbon atoms in C60 and 70 carbon atoms in C70.) Apparently, such small objects as electrons, protons, atoms, and molecules travel as matter waves. However, as we consider larger and more complex objects, there must come a point at which we are no longer justified in consider- ing the wave nature of an object. At that point, we are back in our familiar
nonquantum world, with the physics of earlier chapters of this book. In short, an electron is a matter wave and can undergo interference with itself, but a cat is not a matter wave and cannot undergo interference with itself (which must be a relief to cats). The wave nature of particles and atoms is now taken for granted in many scientific and engineering fields. For example, electron diffraction and neutron diffraction are used to study the atomic structures of solids and liquids, and electron
diffraction is used to study the atomic features of surfaces on solids. Figure 38-10a shows an arrangement that can be used to demonstrate the scattering of either x rays or electrons by crystals. A beam of one or the other is directed onto a target consisting of a layer of tiny aluminum crystals. The x rays have a certain wave- length l. The electrons are given enough energy so that their de Broglie wavelength is the same wavelength l. The scatter of x rays or electrons by the crystals produces
a circular interference pat- tern on a photographic film. Figure 38-10b shows the pattern for the scatter of x rays, and Fig. 38-10c shows the pattern for the scat- ter of electrons.

1. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: is depicted in Figure 38-7. Source S contains molecules that emit photons at well- separated times. Mirrors M1 and M2 are positioned to reflect light that the source emits along two distinct paths, 1 and 2, that are separated by an angle u, which is close to 180°. This arrangement differs from the standard two-slit experiment, in which the angle between the paths of the light reaching two slits is very small. After
reflection from mirrors M1 and M2, the light waves traveling along paths 1 and 2 meet at beam splitter B, which transmits half the incident light and reflects the other half. On the right side of B in Fig. 38-7, the light wave traveling along path 2 and reflected by B combines with the light wave traveling along path 1 and transmitted by B. These two waves then interfere with each other at detec- tor D (a photomultiplier tube that can detect individual photons). The output of the detector is a
randomly spaced series of electronic pulses, one for each detected photon. In the experiment, the beam splitter is moved slowly in a horizontal direction (in the reported experiment, a distance of only about 50 mm maximum), and the detector output is recorded on a chart recorder. Moving the beam splitter changes the lengths of paths 1 and 2, producing a phase shift between the light waves arriving at detector D. Interference maxima and minima appear in the detector’s output signal. This
experiment is difficult to understand in traditional terms. For example, when a molecule in the source emits a single photon, does that photon travel along path 1 or path 2 in Fig. 38-7 (or along any other path)? Or can it move in both directions at once? To answer, we assume that when a molecule emits a pho- ton, a probability wave radiates in all directions from it. The experiment samples this wave in two of those directions, chosen to be nearly opposite each other. We see that we can
interpret all three versions of the double-slit experiment if we assume that (1) light is generated in the source as photons, (2) light is absorbed in the detector as photons, and (3) light travels between source and detector as a probability wave. 1164 CHAPTER 38 PHOTONS AND MATTER WAVES 38-4 THE BIRTH OF QUANTUM PHYSICS After reading this module, you should be able to . . . 38.15 Identify an ideal blackbody radiator and its spectral radiancy S(l). 38.16 Identify the problem that physicists had

2. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: Diffraction by a Double Slit In the double-slit experiments of Chapter 35, we implicitly assumed that the slits were much narrower than the wavelength of the light illuminating them; that is, a 5 l. For such narrow slits, the central maximum of the diffraction pattern of either slit covers the entire viewing screen. Moreover, the interference of light from the two slits produces bright fringes with approximately the
same intensity (Fig. 35-12). In practice with visible light, however, the condition a 5 l is often not met. For relatively wide slits, the interference of light from two slits produces bright fringes that do not all have the same intensity. That is, the intensities of the fringes produced by double-slit interference (as discussed in Chapter 35) are modified by diffraction of the light passing through each slit (as discussed in this chapter). Plots. As an example, the intensity plot of Fig.
36-15a suggests the double- slit interference pattern that would occur if the slits were infinitely narrow (and thus a 5 l); all the bright interference fringes would have the same intensity.The intensity plot of Fig. 36-15b is that for diffraction by a single actual slit; the dif- fraction pattern has a broad central maximum and weaker secondary maxima at ,17".The plot of Fig. 36-15c suggests the interference pattern for two actual slits.

Okay, here's an answer addressing your question about the significance of the double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics, drawing from the provided text and my knowledge of the topic: **The double-slit experiment is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics because it demonstrates that light (and matter) behaves as waves, even when we observe it.** Here's a breakdown of its significance: 1. **Wave-Particle Duality:** The experiment reveals that light (and electrons, protons, atoms, etc.) can exhibit
both wave-like and particle-like properties. Before the quantum revolution, physicists believed that light was simply a stream of particles. The double-slit experiment shows that light passes through two slits simultaneously, creating interference patterns – a characteristic of waves – even though it's being detected as individual photons (particles). 2. **Probability Waves:** Planck’s radiation law, which is derived from the double-slit experiment, provides a crucial insight: **light emitted by
atoms isn't emitted in a single burst; instead, it radiates as a probability wave.** This means each photon has an associated *probability* of hitting a particular point on the screen. 3. **Interference:** The interference patterns observed demonstrate that light waves interfere with themselves – a phenomenon fundamental to wave behavior. This interference is what causes the bright fringes in the double-slit pattern. 4. **Quantum Nature:** It challenges the classical idea of particles as
distinct entities. The experiment highlights that the act of observation (measuring) affects the system, causing the wave-like behavior to disappear and reveal the particle nature of light. In essence, the double-slit experiment provides empirical evidence for the quantum nature of reality—that things aren't always definite until we measure them. It’s a crucial stepping stone toward understanding the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. --- Do you want me to elaborate on any specific
aspect of this answer? For example, would you like me to discuss Planck’s law in more detail?

Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: harvesting protocol. 4.1 Entanglement measures For a state ρAB in the space of states in the Hilbert space of the combined system, an entanglement measure, denoted as E(ρAB ), is defined as a mapping from the space of states to the set of non-negative real numbers (R+). The entanglement measure must satisfy the following conditions: E(ρAB ) = 0 if ρAB represents a separable state. Additionally, E(ρAB) should not, on
average, increase under local operations and classical communications (LOCC). Measuring entanglement is a broad and dynamic area of research in its own right, with many different approaches suggested for quantifying it. The entanglement of formation, intended to assess the resources needed for creating a particular entangled state, is recognized as one of the most fundamental measures [90]. Since the entanglement of formation rises monotonically with the concurrence, determining the concurrence
C of the detectors’ final state suffices to measure the amount of entanglement between them [90]. It provides a bound on the entanglement. The concurrence is defined by C[ρAB] := max[0, λ1 −λ2 −λ3 −λ4], (73) where the λs are the square roots of the eigenvalues of ρAB ˜ρAB in decreasing order. Here, ˜ρAB is defined as (σy ⊗ σy)ρ∗ AB(σy ⊗σy), and σy represents the usual Pauli matrix. Substituting the λs for the reduced density matrix ρAB, shown in (60), in Eq.(73) one obtains [11; 13] C[ρAB] = 2
max[0, |M| − p LAALBB] + O(λ4). (74) Other forms of quantum correlations, such as quantum discord, which quantifies the overall quantumness of correla- tions, also play an important role in relativistic quantum information. We also compute the quantum mutual information, which measures the total correlation between two probes. For a quantum bipartite system, it is defined to be the relative entropy between ρAB and ρA ⊗ρB [11; 13; 91] I[ρAB] := S(ρAB|ρA ⊗ρB) = S(ρA) + S(ρB) −S(ρAB). (75) Here
S(..) denotes the von Neumann entropy, and it is given by the following expressions: S(ρAB) = −TrAB(ρAB log ρAB), S(ρA) = −TrA(ρA log ρA), and S(ρB) = −TrB(ρB log ρB). By expanding Eq. (75) for mutual information to the leading order in terms of the coupling strength λ, one gets I[ρAB] = L+ log L+ + L−log L−−LAA log LAA −LBB log LBB + O(λ4) (76) where, L± = 1 2(LAA + LBB ± p (LAA −LBB)2 + 4LABLBA). (77) In the next subsection, we compute the mutual information, and the concurrence for two UDW
detectors kept along a given trajectory. 4.2 Vacuum correlations outside the horizon In the context of a free scalar field in Minkowski spacetime, when we choose to decompose the state space into plane- wave modes, the overall Hilbert space takes the form of a direct product of infinitely countable harmonic oscillator state spaces, each corresponding to a distinct mode k. Consequently, the resultant state appears as a product state rather than an entangled one. However, an alternative approach
involves utilizing a tensor product of two-mode squeezed (TMS) states in pairs of Rindler modes, which gives rise to entangled Rindler wedges. Additionally, one can also represent the quantum field’s state as a path-ordered or time-ordered exponential operator, acting on local degrees of freedom at each point in space, using variational ans¨atze like continuous matrix-product states (cMPS) and the continuous multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (cMERA) [92; 93]. Such an approach allows
for the interpretation of the vacuum state as a multipartite entangled state [94]. There could be multiple possible choices based on the natural choice for the Hilbert space decomposition, which depends upon the reference frame. Hence, the entanglement harvested by the detector is also expected to depend upon trajectory. In this section and the subsequent ones, we delve into the entanglement characteristics of the multipartite entangled state, employing the assistance of two Unruh-DeWitt (UDWs)
detectors positioned at distinct locations and following various trajectories. 19

1. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: Unlimited quantum correlation advantage from bound entanglement Armin Tavakoli,1, ∗Carles Roch i Carceller,1 Lucas Tendick,2, 3, 4 and Tamás Vértesi5 1Physics Department and NanoLund, Lund University, Box 118, 22100 Lund, Sweden 2Inria, Université Paris-Saclay Palaiseau, France 3CPHT, CNRS, Ecole Polytechnique, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, Palaiseau, France 4LIX, CNRS, Ecole Polytechnique, Institut Polytechnique de
Paris, Palaiseau, France 5HUN-REN Institute for Nuclear Research, P.O. Box 51, H-4001 Debrecen, Hungary (Dated: April 10, 2025) Entangled states that cannot be distilled to maximal entanglement are called bound entangled and they are often viewed as too weak to break the limitations of classical models. Here, we show a strongly contrasting result: that bound entangled states, when deployed as resources between two senders who communicate with a receiver, can generate correlation advantages of
unlimited magnitude. The proof is based on using many copies of a bound entangled state to assist quantum communication. We show that in order to simulate the correlations predicted by bound entanglement, one requires in the many-copy limit either an entanglement visibility that tends to zero or a diverging amount of overhead communication. This capability of bound entanglement is unlocked by only using elementary single-qubit operations. The result shows that bound entanglement can be a
scalable resource for breaking the limitations of physical models without access to entanglement. I. INTRODUCTION Entanglement is the paradigmatic resource for quantum in- formation. Although most useful forms of entanglement can be converted into maximally entangled states by the process of entanglement distillation, there exist also entangled states for which distillation is impossible, even when the state is available in infinitely many copies. These states are called bound entangled [1]; see
Fig 1. In practice, bound entangled states are classified as the entangled states that fail to be de- tected by the seminal positive partial-transpose (PPT) criterion, as the existence of other bound entangled states remains a long-standing open problem [2, 3]. Bound entangled states are remarkably common in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces: their volume becomes superexponentially larger than that of separable states [4], and their distance to the separable set can become arbitrarily large [5].
Nevertheless, bound entangled states are often too weakly entangled to be useful for quantum information protocols, let alone to generate correlations that break the limitations of generic classical models (see the review [6]). For example, bound entangled states can neither be used to beat the classical capacity limit in quantum communication [7] nor the classical fidelity limit in teleportation [8]. Moreover, they have been conjectured to be useless for device-independent quantum key
distribution [9]. For 15 years, the conjecture stood that bound entanglement also cannot violate any Bell inequality [10], be- fore being falsified in 2014 by an explicit counter example [11]. However, the degree of violation, which is of the order 10−4, is too small to make it practically relevant. Despite later works exploring nonlocality from bipartite bound entangled states, no significantly larger violation has been found [12, 13]. Similar trends have also been observed in quantum steering
scenarios [14]. This may suggest that it is a rare occurance that a bound entangled state can violate, even by a tiny margin, a ∗armin.tavakoli@fysik.lu.se FIG. 1: Bipartite quantum states. The sets of separable states, bound entangled states and entangled states. All states that are not separable are entangled. The subset of entangled states that are bound entangled cannot be distilled to maximal entanglement when available in any number of copies. Bell inequality or steering inequality. In
contrast, it was recently shown that three-dimensional bound entangled states can generate significant correlation ad- vantages in scenarios that involve communication between senders and receivers [15]. Subsequently, numerical evi- dence has shown that the correlation advantages can become even more pronounced in communication tasks using four- dimensional bound entanglement [16]. These results pave the way for a much stronger and conceptually important question: Can high-dimensional bound
entanglement generate unlimited correlation advantages over any possible communication model that has no access to entanglement? This question is the focus of this article, and we answer it affirmatively. We consider a scenario with two independent senders and one receiver [17]. The formers respectively hold private clas- sical data and encode it into quantum messages that are sent to the receiver. The receiver decodes the two messages with the aim of learning some binary property of their
combined data. This is illustrated in Fig 2. Importantly, no limitations arXiv:2504.06395v1 [quant-ph] 8 Apr 2025

2. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: multipartite system, classical (non-quantum) joint states reside on the product manifold of the sub- systems’ state spaces. For example, for two sub- systems A and B, if each has a state space MA and MB respectively (with dimensions dA and dB), the combined classical state space (for independent subsystems) is essentially MA × MB, with dimen- sion dA + dB. Any classical correlation can be viewed as a probability
distribution on this prod- uct space (or a mixture of product states), which does not increase the dimensionality of the manifold but rather corresponds to a convex combination in the probability simplex. Quantum entangled states, by contrast, live in the tensor product Hilbert space HA ⊗HB. The pure state space is then CPNAB−1 with NAB = dim(HA⊗HB) = (dim HA)·(dim HB). This is not equivalent to the Cartesian product of CPNA−1 and CPNB−1; rather, CPNAB−1 is a much higher-dimensional manifold in
which the set of separable (unentangled) states forms a lower- dimensional submanifold. For instance, consider two qubits: each qubit alone has a Bloch sphere (2 real dimensions of pure state). The space of all pure states of two qubits is CP3 (6 real dimensions). The submanifold of product states |ψA⟩⊗|ϕB⟩is only 4-dimensional (since we have 2 parameters for |ψA⟩and 2 for |ϕB⟩). The remaining dimensions of CP3 correspond precisely to entangled states that cannot be factored into independent
local descrip- tions. In general, for n qubits, the manifold of all pure states has real dimension 2 n+1−2, whereas the submanifold of fully separable states has dimension 2n, growing only linearly with n. The vast gap be- tween 2n and 2 n+1−2 (which widens exponentially as n increases) quantifies the extensive new degrees of freedom introduced by entanglement. These de- grees of freedom represent non-classical correlations that have no equivalent in any classical geometric representation of n
subsystems, except by embed- ding into this exponentially larger quantum mani- fold. From a geometric standpoint, entanglement can be viewed as a kind of curvature or warping of the composite state space relative to the product structure. The shortest path (geodesic) between two product states within the full quantum state space may actually pass through entangled states, indicating that the geodesics of the curved quantum manifold do not remain on the flat product subman- ifold. Entangled
states often maximize distances from the product manifold: indeed, certain highly entangled states (like Bell states for two qubits) are as far as possible, in Fubini -Study terms, from any separable state. This geometric perspective res- onates with the idea of an entanglement measure: many entanglement measures can be interpreted as the distance of a given state to the nearest sepa- rable state according to some metric. For exam- ple, the Bures distance-based entanglement mea- sure (related to
the concept of an “entanglement distance” in recent literature) assigns zero to sepa- rable states and grows as states become “farther” from all product-state configurations. All these observations underscore that the topology and ge- ometry of quantum state space are fundamentally richer. QML models that exploit entanglement are literally operating in a curved feature space of quan- tum states that classical models (confined to prod- uct manifolds or Euclidean feature spaces) cannot even fully
describe, let alone efficiently traverse. In practical terms, what does this added expres- sivity mean for machine learning? It implies that a quantum model can represent complex relation- ships in data with fewer explicit resources by using entangled quantum features. For instance, if we encode two data points (features) x1 and x2 into two qubits and allow them to become entangled during a quantum circuit, the resulting state can encode joint feature functions (like x1x2 or more complex
combinations) in the quantum amplitudes automatically. Classically, one might need to man- ually construct such joint features or use a network with multiple layers to learn the interaction. Quan- tum superposition and entanglement provide a way to geometrically entangle these features as coordi- nates in a high-dimensional Hilbert space, such that simple operations (like a single rotation or mea- surement) in that space accomplish what would be a highly nonlinear operation in the original data
space. In summary, by exploiting superposition and entanglement, QML models inhabit a super- set state space where data can be represented and transformed in ways no classical geometric model can natively reproduce without exponential over- head. These uniquely quantum aspects expand the “geometric vocabulary” available to learning algo- rithms: not only distances and curvatures of clas- sical manifolds, but also phases, interference pat- terns, and global entangling rotations become avail- able

Okay, here's a breakdown of what "entanglement" means in quantum physics, based on the provided text and my understanding: **Entanglement is a fundamental resource for quantum information.** It refers to a peculiar correlation between two or more quantum systems that cannot be explained by classical correlations. It’s a core concept driving many quantum technologies. Let's break it down further: * **Core Concept:** Entanglement creates a strong connection between particles, even when they are
physically separated. When you measure the state of one entangled particle, you instantly know something about the state of its partner, regardless of the distance separating them. * **It’s not just correlation; it's a deeper property.** The key is that entanglement isn't simply a statistical relationship. It's a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics where particles become inextricably linked. * **Beyond Classical:** Entanglement goes beyond classical correlations, which rely on shared
information or physical proximity. Entangled states are inherently linked in a way that defies classical intuition. **Here’s how it’s described and utilized in the text:** 1. **Separable States & Distinguishable:** Entanglement is often viewed as a "weak" form of entanglement, where the system is separable (meaning you can distinguish between the states). The text emphasizes that bound entangled states are typically too weak to be useful for quantum information protocols. 2. **Resource for
Quantum Communication:** The text highlights that bound entangled states are crucial for communication because they allow for “unlimited correlation advantages” – meaning they can break classical security limits in quantum communications (like the capacity limit). 3. **Quantum Steering & Beyond:** It shows that the concept of entanglement is not just about correlations but also about *steering* quantum systems through a curve in the Hilbert space, where entangled states are used to guide the
system. 4. **Geometric Perspective:** The text explicitly references the geometric aspect of entanglement – the idea that the topology of quantum state spaces (the manifold) influences how these correlations behave. Entanglement “warps” the manifold. In essence, entanglement is a profound and surprisingly powerful phenomenon that has significant implications for the way we understand and utilize quantum information. It’s a key ingredient in many quantum technologies, enabling capabilities that
are impossible with classical systems. Do you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this explanation?

Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: High-energy particle physics was the jewel in the crown of post- war science, at once awesome and glamorous, with its huge accel- erator machines and seemingly unending list of newly discovered subatomic particles. Feynman’s research was directed mostly toward making sense of the results of this enterprise. A great unifying theme among particle physicists has been the role of symmetry and conservation laws in bringing
order to the subatomic zoo. As it happens, many of the symmetries known to particle physi- cists were familiar already in classical physics. Chief among these are the symmetries that arise from the homogeneity of space and time. Take time: apart from cosmology, where the big bang marked the beginning of time, there is nothing in physics to distinguish one moment of time from the next. Physicists say that the world is “invariant under time translations,” meaning that whether you take midnight or
midday to be the zero of time in your measurements, it makes no difference to the description of physical phenomena. Physical processes do not depend on an absolute zero of time. It turns out that this symmetry under time translation directly implies one of the most basic, and also most useful, laws of physics: the law of conservation of energy. This law says that you can move en- ergy around and change its form but you can’t create or destroy it. Feynman makes this law crystal clear with his
amusing story of Dennis the Menace who is always mischievously hiding his toy building blocks from his mother (Chapter Four). The most challenging lecture in this volume is the last, which is an exposition on quantum physics. It is no exaggeration to say that quantum mechanics had dominated twentieth-century physics and is far and away the most successful scientiﬁc theory in existence. It is indispensable for understanding subatomic particles, atoms and nuclei, molecules and chemical bonding,
the structure of solids, su- perconductors and superﬂuids, the electrical and thermal conduc- tivity of metals and semiconductors, the structure of stars, and much else. It has practical applications ranging from the laser to the microchip. All this from a theory that at ﬁrst sight—and second sight—looks absolutely crazy!

Based on the provided text, the “hierarchy problem” in particle physics refers to the challenge of reconciling the seemingly successful and well-established laws of physics (like conservation of energy) with the observed vastness of the universe and the apparent lack of fundamental physical constants that would make it possible for such a theory to be truly universal. Here’s a breakdown of how the text suggests this is addressed: * **The Problem:** Physicists have discovered that the laws of
physics are incredibly precise and consistent, but they don't explain *why* these laws exist or what fundamental forces govern everything. The universe appears to be far more complex than our current models allow. * **Feynman’s Work:** Feynman’s research focused on finding a unifying principle – symmetry and conservation laws – that could explain the seemingly arbitrary nature of these laws across different scales. However, he found this theory was not enough to explain why there are so many
fundamental constants in physics. The text indicates that the hierarchy problem is a significant obstacle to developing a complete and consistent theory of everything. It’s essentially the question: “How do we reconcile the seemingly simple laws we have with the enormous complexity of reality?”

1. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: I. INTRODUCTION In 2012, the discovery of a neutral Higgs boson with a mass around 125 GeV by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) marked a signiﬁcant milestone in particle physics [1]. The properties of this newly discovered particle were found to be consistent with the predictions made by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Within the SM, the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism
explains how gauge bosons acquire their masses through the process of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). However, the Standard Model does not accommodate the existence of charged Higgs bosons, prompting theorists to propose extensions that suggest their presence. Several theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) incorporate the existence of charged Higgs bosons, such as the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM), supersym- metric theories, composite Higgs models, grand uniﬁed theories, and axion
models. The 2HDM is especially important as it is structurally relevant in various new physics models, including the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and composite Higgs theories. The characteristics and interactions of charged Higgs bosons vary depending on their couplings to quarks, and discovering such charged states would indicate a deeper level of complexity in the Higgs sector beyond what the Standard Model describes. The photon-photon (γγ) collider at the International Linear
Collider (ILC) oﬀers a promising experimental opportunity in high-energy physics. It could lead to the detection of charged Higgs bosons and other new phenomena. Within this experimental setup, high-energy electron-positron beams will collide, resulting in the generation of energetic photons that will collide with one another. This unique environment provides an excellent opportunity to explore various interac- tions and processes, especially in the production of charged Higgs bosons. Future
e+e−and γγ colliders oﬀer higher sensitivity and luminosity compared to traditional e+e−collisions, potentially improving the chances of discovering new charged states. Preliminary analyses indicate that the production rates for the γγ →H+H−mode may surpass those of the γγ →H+H−process due to the suppression of s-channel contributions at higher energies. While the production of charged Higgs pairs through e+e−and γγ) collisions have been examined at various levels of theoretical precision,
further investigation is essential to dissect the intricacies of these processes, especially considering the implications of loop corrections in diﬀerent models. This paper focuses on a multivariate analysis of charged Higgs boson production at the photon- 2

2. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: 1 Introduction The discovery of a Higgs boson at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in 2012 [1] conﬁrms the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking [2]. The measured properties of the observed Higgs boson are consistent with the expectations of the Standard Model (SM) within the current experimental precision [3]. However, an admixture of CP-odd components to the
Higgs boson mass state is still possible [4]. Despite that the SM works extremely well, it has problems that cannot be solved within it. These include neutrino oscillations, matter–antimatter asymmetry, strong CP problem, and the nature of dark matter, forcing us to consider SM as an eﬀective theory at low-energy. At higher energies it may demonstrate new symmetries and include new ﬁelds, so the Higgs sector can be nonminimal and besides the SM Higgs doublet can contain additional Higgs
multiplets. In the simplest SM extension the Higgs sector includes two SU(2) doublets (Two-Higgs Doublet Model, 2HDM) [5] resulting in ﬁve physical Higgs states, two of them are charged H± and three states are neutral, in the CP-conserving limit (CPC) they are CP-even h and H states and a CP-odd state A; in a model with CP-violation (CPV) of the Higgs potential they are h1, h2, h3 states with indeﬁnite CP-parity [6]. In any beyond-the-SM theory (BSM), properties of the observed Higgs boson
(within the precision of experiment) must satisfy the Higgs alignment limit conditions [7] m = 125 GeV, g ≡yBSM/ySM ≃1, (1) where m is the mass of the observed Higgs boson, ySM, yBSM are its Yukawa couplings in the SM and the BSM, correspondingly. Deviations from the SM predictions in the Higgs sector may be observed in self-interactions of scalar ﬁelds, interactions with light quarks and leptons and particle interactions with CP-violation which will be unambiguous evidence of the nonstandard
Higgs sector1 (see [8]). Two approaches to the analysis of the Higgs alignment limit are developed: it can be achieved either through the imposition of symmetries [9–11] or through ﬁne-tuning [8, 12–16]. The ﬁrst approach is based on the analysis of possible symmetries that lead to the SM alignment limit within the 2HDM. It is assumed that at some high mass scale a symmetry exists which ensures naturally an alignment (or universalization) of the Higgs boson interactions with the SM par- ticles
(Natural SM-Higgs Alignment, NHAL). It was shown in [10] that for the CP-conserving limit three types of symmetries are possible which guarantee NHAL without decoupling (sim- plest symmetry of this sort is SO(5) and the corresponding model is known as the Maximally Symmetric Two Higgs Doublet Model, MS-2HDM). In the case of CP violation, the number of such symmetries increases [17]. At a smaller scale, the symmetry is softly broken, and there will be some deviation from the alignment limit in
the low-energy Higgs spectrum as a consequence of the renormalization group eﬀects due to the hypercharge gauge coupling g′ and the third- generation Yukawa couplings [10]. In the second approach, the nature of the alignment limit is not investigated; instead, it is assumed that on the electroweak energy scale, the alignment limit is precisely or approximately fulﬁlled presenting an inherently ﬁne-tuning example (an eﬀective low-energy approach). The present analysis is carried out within the
framework of the second approach. 1The eﬀects of CP-violating interactions of the SM Higgs boson due to CKM-matrix are so tiny that the observations of them are beyond the experimental possibilities. 2

Okay, let's break down how spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) relates to the Higgs mechanism, based on the provided text. **Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB)** is a fundamental concept in particle physics that describes a situation where a system has multiple possible states that are equivalent under certain conditions – essentially, it 'breaks' its inherent symmetry. In the context of the Higgs sector, it’s crucial for explaining how the Higgs boson acquires its mass. Here's how it works
within the text: 1. **The Standard Model’s Symmetry:** The Standard Model assumes a fundamental symmetry called "gauge symmetry." This symmetry dictates that the laws of physics should be consistent regardless of the choice of gauge (a specific way to combine forces). 2. **The Higgs Mechanism and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking:** The Higgs mechanism proposes that the Higgs field itself has a *self-symmetry*. This means it possesses a property that makes its different states equivalent under
certain transformations. It’s like a ball with two sides - it's symmetric, but when you spin it, it can be in either direction. This self-symmetry is what allows the Higgs field to acquire a non-zero value at low energies – this is the crucial step where the Higgs boson 'emerges'. 3. **The Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM):** The text introduces the 2HDM as an example of how SSB can occur. It proposes that the Higgs field has two distinct states – a “charged” state and a “neutral” state, which are
equivalent under certain conditions. The crucial aspect is that this symmetry breaking *doesn't* lead to a violation of fundamental symmetries; it simply modifies the way the Higgs boson interacts with other particles (like quarks and leptons) at low energies. **In essence, SSB is the process where a system spontaneously transforms into multiple states that are equivalent under certain conditions.** The Higgs field, due to its self-symmetry, undergoes this transformation, leading to the observed
Higgs boson – the key particle responsible for giving mass to other particles. Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!

0. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: 3 Let Nature guide us It is often argued that, due to the lack of experimental and observational data, we cannot use experiments and observations to guide us towards a theory of quantum gravity that goes beyond GR and, therefore, we can only resort to theoretical consistency requirements [110, 34, 111] or numerical tools [112]. Instead, we will now provide solid, concrete evidence showing that we can actually use
guidance from observations. The following two steps are quite logical and scientifically reasonable: (i) If new experiments or observations cannot be explained by pure GR, then we can use them to guide us toward understanding what kind of additional terms need to be added to the Einstein-Hilbert action to describe the observed new physics; (ii) After having phenomenologically modeled the new terms, we ask whether there is any fundamental guiding principle or mechanism that can justify the new
Lagrangian. For this second step, it is very natural to first check whether what has worked in the past as a selection principle can be useful for gravity as well, in particular whether the QFT framework and the strict renormalizability criterion can successfully select a gravitational Lagrangian through which the new physics can be described. 3.1 Early universe cosmology and R2-driven inflation It is well-known that the Einstein-Hilbert action alone fails to provide a satisfactory physical
description of our universe at early times, in particular it cannot explain the observed temperature anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [113,114]. A simple way to interpret the CMB data is to assume that at very early times there was some sort of accelerated expansion phase, driven by some field whose subsequent quantum fluctuations would have acted as inhomogeneous seeds for the formation of large-scale structures and galaxies, thus leaving an imprint in the CMB in the form
of temperature anisotropies. Phenomenologically, this primordial inflationary phase is usually described by adding by hand a scalar field ϕ coupled to gravity and with a suitable self-potential, i.e. SEH[g] → SEH[g] + Sϕ[g, ϕ] , (13) where Sϕ is the contribution of the self-interacting scalar field coupled to gravity. Some of the free parameters appearing in Sϕ can then be fitted by matching with CMB observations. Of course, to have a consistent picture of our universe we should also add other
contributions due to ordinary and dark matter, in addition to the cosmological constant one.5 5Here we are not concerned with the problems of dark matter and dark energy. In any case, we are comfortable with having a small cosmological constant which, in quadratic gravity, is simply a free parameter that can be renormalized to any measured value. 13

1. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: 5 An instructive historical note After the discovery of special relativity and quantum mechanics, it was believed more than once that a new revolution was necessary to make progress in fundamental physics. However, it turned out that no revolution was actually needed, but simply a deeper understanding of what was already available, namely QFT and renormalizability. These two have faced various challenges in the last
century, but ultimately overcome them all. Nowadays it seems that the QFT framework and the strict renormalizability paradigm are going through a new phase of challenges related to understanding gravity at a more fundamental level. Before concluding, we want to recall some of the past challenges, often forgotten or even unknown to the young generation (as it was for this author), and see if we can learn new lessons that can help us overcome the current “gravitational” challenge. We do not aim or
pretend to be able to present a complete historical account, but we will simply highlight those aspects that we feel are important for the main message we wish to convey at the end. For more detailed historical accounts of the developments of QFT and SM we refer readers to [1,168–176]. “Electromagnetic” challenge In the 1930s and most of the 1940s, physicists were struggling to unify special relativity and quantum mechanics into the same framework, especially because of the puzzling UV
infinities of QFT. The older generation (especially the founders of quantum mechanics) believed that a new revolution was needed and/or that a more suitable framework needed to be found [177,178]. Alternative approaches. In 1938 Werner Heisenberg considered the existence of a universal minimal length to cutoff the infinities [179]. In 1943 he was the first to propose the “S-matrix theory” [180] (whose concept was introduced by John Wheeler in 1937 [181]) as an alternative framework that does not
involve fields and Lagrangians, but instead deals only with directly- measurable quantities. In 1942 Paul Dirac considered a generalization of quantum mechanics that included additional intermediate states with negative norms, which could give rise to cancellations in loop diagrams and make the theory finite [182]. Furthermore, Max Born believed that the laws of nature should be invariant under reciprocity [183], i.e. roughly under x →1/p, and was led to propose a non-local theory of
electrodynamics through which he wanted to obtain a finite self-energy for the electron [184–186]. Hideki Yukawa followed a similar path [187,188]. QFT and strict renormalizability. All these alternative attempts failed, in particular none of them could explain the measurement of the Lamb shift [189], first presented by Willis Lamb at the Shelter Island conference in 1947. During the same conference, Hans Kramers proposed the idea of renormalization that eventually turned out to be the key to
making sense of the UV infinities [171]. Soon after, Hans Bethe made a non-relativistic computation implementing the renormalization method and could obtain a quantitative result for the Lamb shift that was 19

known physics, yet it is the weakest in coupling strength among all fundamental forces, making it exceedingly difficult to capture its presence. While the elegant framework of General Relativity was established already a century ago, the direct detection of gravitational waves was only recently confirmed with extremely sensitive experiments [1, 2]. Although the curvature fluctuations predicted by inflation are already observed in the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, primordial
gravitational waves remain elusive. Despite the fact that inflation might be the highest energy scale accessible to us, due to Planck mass suppression, the strength of such signals is extremely small, and now the tensor-to- scalar ratio is constrained to r ⪅O(0.01) [3]. To capture more signals, we either keep improving the sensitivity of experiments or look for more dramatic sources, such as the merger of more massive compact objects, large scalar perturbations acting as secondary sources [4–8],
and so on. This paper explores an alternative possibility. The weakness of gravitational interactions orig- inates from the tiny gravitational coupling constant. As a result, scattering processes in vacuum states are rare, making gravitational interactions difficult to detect. For an event of a small scat- tering cross section, a straightforward solution is to increase the number of target particles that interact with gravitons. Under the assumption of general relativity, the coupling between
matter and gravitons is ubiquitous. In the high-temperature limit, the number of target particles diverges. Naively, one might expect that graviton dynamics could be observed if the temperature is sufficiently high. Is this expectation correct? As a simple toy model, let us consider a free massless scalar field χ, minimally coupled to gravitons, hij. The cross-section of gravitons is M −2 pl , with Mpl being the reduced Planck mass.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the challenges that arise when attempting to unify General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM), based on the provided text: **The Core Problem:** The primary challenge is the incompatibility between GR and QM due to the fundamental differences in how they describe space, time, and gravity. Here’s a more detailed look at the issues: 1. **The Nature of Gravity:** GR describes gravity as a geometric property of spacetime – curvature caused by mass and energy.
Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, generally treats physical quantities (like position, momentum, etc.) as being quantized – meaning they come in discrete units. GR inherently involves continuous spacetime geometry, while QM typically works with discrete variables. 2. **The Problem of Infinities:** In early attempts to quantize GR (especially when considering the very early universe), physicists ran into problems with "infinities." These infinities arise when trying to apply quantum
mechanical rules to situations involving gravity. It's not that the math is wrong, but the calculations lead to nonsensical results. 3. **The Measurement Problem:** The text highlights a key issue: GR and QM are both fundamentally about measurement. When we measure something (like the Lamb shift), GR predicts a specific outcome, while QM suggests there’s an inherent uncertainty in how we can know precisely what's happening at the quantum level. This creates a conflict. 4. **The Role of the
Graviton:** The text also emphasizes that gravitons are fundamental particles that mediate gravitational forces. However, the concept of a "graviton" as a particle is still being actively debated within physics. It’s not clear if gravitons are truly fundamental or emerge from something deeper. **In essence, the difficulty lies in reconciling the seemingly different descriptions of reality at the most fundamental levels – spacetime and quantum mechanics.** Let me know if you'd like a more
detailed explanation of any specific aspect!

1. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: 1 Introduction The black hole information loss problem has been explored from various perspectives, such as probabilistic spacetime the- ory, transfinite set theory, quantum metrology, quantum teleportation, relativistic quantum information, the AdS/CFT correspondence, and more [1; 2; 3; 4]. One of the crucial elements in addressing the black hole information loss problem is the quantum entanglement present in matter
fields. To have a deeper understanding of the entanglement inherent in the field, one can consider the associated algebra and its properties in the context of a freely chosen tensor-product decomposition of the full state Hilbert space [5]. The Hilbert space decomposition depends upon the reference frames that one chooses. Furthermore, the curvature of spacetime also plays a significant role by affecting the derivatives in field equations that influence the degree of entanglement within the
field [6; 7; 8]. The entanglement dynamics of spacetime and matter are particularly important in the framework of a information complete quantum field theory, which may pave a way for unifying quantum theory and general relativity [9; 10]. Additionally, entanglement and other vacuum correla- tions has also been shown to be affected by other elements, such as the Hawking and local Unruh effect [11; 12; 13; 14]. These effects are also used to explain the transformation between different forms of
vacuum correlations [15; 16]. The expected emergence of Hawking particles (or quasi-particles) also carries substantial significance at various other places – apart from black hole physics– in the natural phenomena where quantum excitations propagate within a Lorentzian geometry resembling black holes [17]. In the pursuit of harvesting the entanglement, [18] initially and later [19; 20; 21; 22] proposed a way to harvest the entanglement using quantum probes. In particular, [19] investigated the
entanglement present in the vacuum of a massless scalar field by using a pair of causally disconnected two-level detectors coupled to the field. Subsequently, different types of probes were analyzed, including quantum harmonic oscillators and qubits, employing various coupling types, including both linear and nonlinear couplings, in various spacetimes [23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28; 29]. In particular, [24] and [25] introduce the formalism and limitations of a covariant model of smeared particle
detectors. [29] use a complex detector model to study the antiparticle sector of a non-Hermitian field. The distinct entanglement-harvesting profiles due to minimal and conformal couplings have been illustrated in [30]. [31] showed that vacuum entanglement harvesting is significantly more efficient for a smooth switching mechanism than a sudden one, especially for spacelike separations. Moreover, the performance of measurements on quantum fields also affect entanglement harvesting [32]. In the
context of black holes, the entanglement harvesting protocol described in [11; 13; 33], involving static detectors coupled to a real massless scalar field, suggests that the horizon inhibits any kind of correlation near it. However, freely falling detectors coupled to the massless scalar field don’t experience such decay due to the finite relative gravitational redshift [13]. Furthermore, at near infinite acceleration of the quantum probes, the entanglement of the fermionic field can be either
zero or nonzero, unlike that of the scalar field, depending on the choice of the state in the Rindler spacetime as well in the near horizon limit of a Schwarzschild black hole [34; 35]. The generation of entanglement between modes pair of a quantum field within a single, rigid cavity undergoing non-uniform motion in Minkowski space-time is also shown to be influenced by the field’s statistics [36]. Moreover, the entanglement tradeoff across horizons also depends on the statistics [37]. The
entanglement properties of fermionic fields differ from those of bosonic fields in several contexts. Notably, the manner in which fermionic fields become entangled prompted [38] to suggest that fermionic field entanglement, arising from the expansion of the universe, can be used to reconstruct parameters characterizing the history of cosmic expansion. Despite the certain different entanglement properties of fermionic and bosonic fields, studies on the entanglement harvesting protocol involving a
detector moving along a specified trajectory and coupled to a fermionic field in a black hole spacetime are limited. In particular, the roles of gravitational redshift, the Hawking and anti-Hawking effects, vacuum polarization, and similar phenomena have not been extensively explored for fermionic fields. Takagi [39] initially explored the detector response function of a Unruh DeWitt (UDW) detector coupled linearly to the scalar density of a massless Fermionic field in Minkowski spacetime.
Subsequently, [40] and [41] demonstrated the similarities and differences between the UDW coupled linearly to the scalar density of the massless fermionic field and that coupled to a massless scalar field in flat spacetime. Notably, while the numerical values of the entanglement measures, harvested using detectors, depend on various detector parameters — such as the energy gap and the switching function — a systematic comparison can still be made by keeping certain parameters fixed while varying
others. [29] studied an example of entanglement harvesting from a fermionic field in flat spacetime. However, the study of entanglement harvesting for fermionic fields in curved spacetime is limited. This further motivates us to compare an analysis of entanglement harvesting for a detector coupled to the scalar density of the Fermionic field with that of a scalar field in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. In section 2, we start with a concise review of quantum field theory applied to
fermionic fields within the context of curved spacetime and then present the derivation of the two-point functions needed in subsequent sections in various vacuum states. The two-point function in a pure global Gaussian state contains all information about the field. We 3

//////// System Response:

The black hole information paradox arises from a conflict between two fundamental principles in physics: quantum mechanics and general relativity. Here’s a breakdown of the core issue: **The Paradox:** * **Quantum Mechanics (QM):** Information – that is, any complete description of a system (like a particle's state) – can never truly be destroyed. It must always be preserved. * **General Relativity (GR):** Gravity, according to Einstein’s theory, is not a force but rather a curvature of
spacetime caused by mass and energy. It suggests that information about what fell into the black hole could potentially be released back when it eventually evaporates. **The Conflict:** When physicists attempt to apply quantum mechanics to black holes – particularly to Hawking radiation (the emission of thermal radiation from black holes), they run into a problem: **Hawking radiation appears to be completely random.** It seems that every time Hawking emits a particle, it effectively destroys the
information about what fell into the black hole. This violates a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics – unitarity – which demands that information is never truly lost. **The Proposed Solution (and its complications):** One proposed solution is that information is *not* truly lost but rather encoded in subtle correlations within the Hawking radiation itself. However, this solution introduces significant challenges: 1. **Lack of a Complete Picture:** We don’t have a complete theory of
quantum gravity yet – a unified framework that combines QM and GR. Without a proper understanding of how information is preserved, it's difficult to definitively say what happens to the information emitted by black holes. 2. **The Information Loss Theorem:** This theorem essentially says that if you could perfectly reconstruct the initial state of a system from its Hawking radiation, you would have lost all the information about that system. **In short, the black hole information paradox
highlights a fundamental tension between our best physical theories – quantum mechanics and general relativity – and remains one of the most actively researched problems in theoretical physics.** Do you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this paradox or its potential resolutions?

0. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: 3 Let Nature guide us It is often argued that, due to the lack of experimental and observational data, we cannot use experiments and observations to guide us towards a theory of quantum gravity that goes beyond GR and, therefore, we can only resort to theoretical consistency requirements [110, 34, 111] or numerical tools [112]. Instead, we will now provide solid, concrete evidence showing that we can actually use
guidance from observations. The following two steps are quite logical and scientifically reasonable: (i) If new experiments or observations cannot be explained by pure GR, then we can use them to guide us toward understanding what kind of additional terms need to be added to the Einstein-Hilbert action to describe the observed new physics; (ii) After having phenomenologically modeled the new terms, we ask whether there is any fundamental guiding principle or mechanism that can justify the new
Lagrangian. For this second step, it is very natural to first check whether what has worked in the past as a selection principle can be useful for gravity as well, in particular whether the QFT framework and the strict renormalizability criterion can successfully select a gravitational Lagrangian through which the new physics can be described. 3.1 Early universe cosmology and R2-driven inflation It is well-known that the Einstein-Hilbert action alone fails to provide a satisfactory physical
description of our universe at early times, in particular it cannot explain the observed temperature anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [113,114]. A simple way to interpret the CMB data is to assume that at very early times there was some sort of accelerated expansion phase, driven by some field whose subsequent quantum fluctuations would have acted as inhomogeneous seeds for the formation of large-scale structures and galaxies, thus leaving an imprint in the CMB in the form
of temperature anisotropies. Phenomenologically, this primordial inflationary phase is usually described by adding by hand a scalar field ϕ coupled to gravity and with a suitable self-potential, i.e. SEH[g] → SEH[g] + Sϕ[g, ϕ] , (13) where Sϕ is the contribution of the self-interacting scalar field coupled to gravity. Some of the free parameters appearing in Sϕ can then be fitted by matching with CMB observations. Of course, to have a consistent picture of our universe we should also add other
contributions due to ordinary and dark matter, in addition to the cosmological constant one.5 5Here we are not concerned with the problems of dark matter and dark energy. In any case, we are comfortable with having a small cosmological constant which, in quadratic gravity, is simply a free parameter that can be renormalized to any measured value. 13

1. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: Strict renormalizability as a paradigm for fundamental physics Luca Buoninfante High Energy Physics Department, Institute for Mathematics, Astrophysics, and Particle Physics, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands luca.buoninfante@ru.nl Abstract An important theoretical achievement of the last century was the realization that strict renormalizability can be a powerful criterion to select Lagrangians in the
framework of per- turbative quantum field theory. The Standard Model Lagrangian (without gravity) is strictly renormalizable from a perturbative point of view. On the other hand, the inclusion of gravity seems not to respect this criterion, since general relativity is perturbatively non- renormalizable. The aim of this work is to provide concrete evidence that strict renormal- izability is still a valid criterion even when applied to gravity. First, we show that adding quadratic curvature terms
to the Einstein-Hilbert action gives rise to a strictly renormalizable theory known as quadratic gravity. Second, we argue that this unique theory represents the most conservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, is highly predictive, as it can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in the sub-Planckian regime. In particular, it provides one of the best fits to the CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation and makes sharp cosmological predictions that can be
tested in the near future. Finally, we comment on the (super-)Planckian regime and conclude with a historical note. arXiv:2504.05900v1 [hep-th] 8 Apr 2025

2. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: years we have discovered that all mass is made of tiny particles and that there are several kinds of interactions, such as nuclear forces, etc. None of these nuclear or electrical forces has yet been found to explain gravitation. The quantum-mechanical aspects of nature have not yet been carried over to gravitation. When the scale is so small that we need the quantum effects, the gravitational effects are so weak that
the need for a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet developed. On the other hand, for consistency in our physical theories it would be important to see whether Newton’s law mod- iﬁed to Einstein’s law can be further modiﬁed to be consistent with the uncertainty principle. This last modiﬁcation has not yet been completed. 113 The Theory of Gravitation

Okay, here’s a response addressing how the concept of quantum gravity attempts to address the limitations of current physical theories, based on the provided text and my understanding of the topic: **The Core Challenge – Limitations of Current Theories:** According to the Knowledge Base, the primary challenge in physics is the failure of standard models (like the Standard Model) to provide a complete description of gravity. Current theories like general relativity are perturbatively
non-renormalizable – meaning they don't work well when you try to make them extremely precise by adding tiny details. This suggests that there’s a fundamental gap in our understanding of how gravity works at very small scales and high energies. **How Quantum Gravity Addresses These Limitations:** The text highlights several strategies quantum gravity attempts to overcome these limitations: 1. **Renormalizability as a Criterion:** The text emphasizes that strict renormalizability is a crucial
criterion for selecting Lagrangian functions (the mathematical descriptions of physical theories). The standard model, without gravity, *is* strictly renormalizable – which suggests it’s a potential solution. 2. **Quadratic Curvature Terms:** Quantum gravity proposes adding "quadratic curvature terms" to the Einstein-Hilbert action. This is a key step in trying to revive the idea that gravity is fundamentally different from other forces and can be described by quantum mechanics. The text states
this could lead to a theory where gravity is not perturbatively non-renormalizable. 3. **Predictive Power & CMB Fits:** The text suggests this approach, specifically quadratic gravity, offers a unique theoretical framework that *can* explain new physics beyond general relativity and can be used to successfully predict results from observations like the CMB anisotropies. 4. **Historical Note:** The text also acknowledges that for a long time the quantum mechanical aspects of nature have not been
carried over to gravitation. In essence, quantum gravity seeks to provide a framework where gravity *is* fundamentally described by quantum mechanics, rather than being treated as a force acting on particles. Do you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this response or perhaps discuss potential challenges with this approach?

0. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: 3 I. INTRODUCTION One of the most enduring puzzles in modern cosmology is the accelerating expansion of the Universe. The impe- tus for introducing an additional component beyond or- dinary matter first arose in the 1980s, when early cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy calculations showed that a low-density open model would conflict with small-scale CMB observations. Subsequently, large-scale clustering
analyses [1] and baryon-fraction arguments [2] made it clear that a Universe consisting solely of critical- density dark matter was untenable, prompting the emer- gence of a cosmological constant (Λ) as the leading expla- nation. Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) then provided direct evidence for an accelerating cosmic ex- pansion [3, 4], and by the turn of the millennium, the ΛCDM framework was firmly established as the consen- sus model of cosmology. This paradigm has been contin-
uously supported by increasingly precise CMB measure- ments [5] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data [6], solidifying its status as the standard picture of cosmic ac- celeration. Despite this consensus, the fundamental cause of cos- mic acceleration remains elusive. A widely favored in- terpretation involves postulating an effective dark en- ergy (DE) component that dominates the current energy density of the Universe (see [7–9] for reviews). Provided its sound speed is not too small, DE
can be treated as nearly homogeneous on sub-sound-horizon scales, leaving its main cosmological signatures determined by its energy density ρ and pressure P. The equation of state (EoS), w ≡P/c2ρ, serves as a crucial diagnostic: w = −1 cor- responds to vacuum energy, while dynamical DE models allow w to vary with time, as exemplified by quintessence [10], phantom [11], quintom [12], k-essence [13], Chaply- gin gas [14], and holographic dark energy [15]. Subclasses of these scenarios can be
further differentiated by exam- ining their trajectories in the phase space spanned by  w, dw/d ln a  , where a is the cosmic scale factor [16]. Recent observational progress, including supernova measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) [17], as well as other large SNe compilations such as Pan- theonPlus [18, 19] and Union [20], high-precision CMB data from the Planck Collaboration [21], and BAO results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) eBOSS pro- gram [22], has significantly
refined our insight into DE. These complementary probes constrain DE-related pa- rameters with growing precision, thus enhancing our un- derstanding of cosmic acceleration. While combined anal- yses that integrate all available datasets provide the most stringent overall limits, it remains instructive to consider c gbzhao@nao.cas.cn d levon@sfu.ca e kazuya.koyama@port.ac.uk each probe in isolation. Such a modular approach not only underscores the unique strengths and systematics of each
measurement but also furnishes critical cross-checks, reinforcing the robustness of DE constraints. The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona marks a sig- nificant step forward in Stage IV large-scale structure surveys [23, 24]. Designed with a 3.2◦diameter prime fo- cus corrector [25], DESI deploys 5,000 fibers [26] via a robotic focal plane assembly [27] to simultaneously mea- sure multiple spectra. These hardware capabilities are bolstered by
a high-throughput spectroscopic data pro- cessing pipeline [28] and an efficient operations plan [29]. Since beginning operations in 2021, DESI has been gath- ering high-fidelity spectra for numerous target classes— Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS; 0.1 < z < 0.4) [30], Lu- minous Red Galaxies (LRGs; 0.4 < z < 1.1) [31], Emis- sion Line Galaxies (ELGs; 1.1 < z < 1.6) [32], Quasars (QSOs; 0.8 < z < 2.1) [33], and the Lyman-α Forest (1.77 < z < 4.16) [34]. Early data analyses and sur- vey validation [24,
35] confirmed that DESI satisfies the performance benchmarks required for a Stage IV survey, advancing our grasp of dark energy’s role in cosmic ex- pansion [23]. DESI’s Data Release 1 (DR1) spans observations from May 14, 2021, to June 14, 2022 [36], and has already yielded new insights into dark energy by detecting the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signature in galaxy and quasar clustering [37], as well as in the Lyman- α forest [38]. These results fit seamlessly with external data [39],
paving the way for more comprehensive analy- ses that incorporate the full clustering information from the DESI galaxy sample and other tracers [40, 41]. The subsequent Data Release 2 (DR2), covering observations through April 9, 2024 [42–44], not only encompasses the entirety of DR1 but also extends the redshift range and statistical reach of the survey. This expanded dataset of- fers a critical test of dynamical dark energy: if dark en- ergy truly evolves over cosmic time, the enriched DR2
sample could reveal a more pronounced signature. By comparing DR1 and DR2 results, one can assess both internal consistency and potential evidence for evolving dark energy. This paper contributes to a suite of compan- ion analyses that build on the main cosmological results [44], with related supporting study on dark energy [45] and neutrino constraints [46]. DESI BAO observations place stringent limits on the Universe’s background expansion history, achieving a level of precision on a par with
recent SNe surveys. These include the PantheonPlus compilation of 1,550 spectro- scopically confirmed SNe [18, 19], the Union3 compilation of 2,087 SNe [20], and the five-year Dark Energy Survey sample (DESY5) [17]. In this work, we take two approaches to investigate the dynamics of dark energy, namely, a ‘shape-function’ analysis, and a Bayesian reconstruction for the EoS function of dark energy using a correlation prior mo- tivated by theory.

1. Description from Knowledge Base which should help you answer the question: tor v in (30) – indicates a fundamental anisotropy of space-time. As highlighted in (33), in QFT with dimensional reduction, the vacuum possesses not only energy but also momentum along a particular direction. Consequently, even though all the possible new effects are suppressed by the scale M, the stress-energy tensor is expected to develop non-diagonal components. This might impact the Friedmann equation, potentially
suggesting non-standard cosmological ef- fects, namely, departing from the cosmological principle [45]. Further exploration of this direc- tion is compelling but beyond our current scope. In summary, while phenomenological studies in the literature investigate potential effects of varying dimensions [46], we believe our work provides the theoretical foundation for such scenarios. A dedicated study will be needed to analyze further consequences for particle physics and cosmology. Acknowledgement
AM thanks Emanuela Pichelli for discussions during this work on the appearance of fractals in the physical world. A S-matrix and Poincar´e invariance of the vacuum This appendix highlights some known problems in building a consistent S−matrix in interaction picture in QFT. Equation (40) relies on the interaction picture where the free field, ϕ0, and the interactive field, ϕ, are unitarly related: ϕ(t,⃗x) = U(t0, t)†ϕ0(t,⃗x)U(t0, t) , (45) and the vacua |0⟩and |Ω⟩of the free and interactive Fock
spaces, respectively, are two distinct vectors, e.g., as (39), |Ω⟩̸= |0⟩. (46) In standard QFT, namely, in the absence of the fractality and reduction scale, the unitary op- erator U(t0, t) exists only in the trivial case, with no interaction, for which such an operator is just the identity. This result is known as the Haag theorem, heavily relying on the translational invariance of the vacuum. It may be helpful to recall how this invariance leads to the no-go of the theorem, following [35] –
see [47] for a rigorous proof within axiomatic QFT. For shortness, we denote U(t0, t) := U and call T0 and T the translational operator in the free and interactive Fock spaces. The translational invariance of the vacuua reads, T0|0⟩= |0⟩ T|Ω⟩= |Ω⟩. (47) 16

If we ponder over the question as to how the universe, considered as a whole, is to be
regarded, the first answer that suggests itself to us is surely this : As regards space (and time) the universe is infinite. There are stars everywhere, so that the density of matter, although very variable in detail, is nevertheless on the average everywhere the same. In other words : However far we might travel through space, we should find everywhere an attenuated swarm of fixed stars of approximately the same kind and density.

Okay, here’s an explanation of the significance of the cosmological constant problem, based on the provided text: **The Significance of the Cosmological Constant Problem** According to the text, the cosmological constant problem is a significant challenge in cosmology because it arises from fundamental difficulties in reconciling our current understanding of the universe with observations. Here's a breakdown of why it’s important and what the issue entails: 1. **The Core Issue:** The text
highlights that the standard cosmological model – the ΛCDM model (Lambda-Cold Dark Matter) – relies heavily on the cosmological constant (Λ) to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe. However, observations show that the expansion *is* actually accelerating, which contradicts this standard model. 2. **The Problem:** The text emphasizes that the current best explanation for this acceleration is the presence of a "cosmological constant" – a term that essentially represents negative
pressure in space. However, there’s a major problem: **the amount of dark energy predicted by the ΛCDM model doesn't match what we observe.** 3. **The Difficulty:** The text states that this discrepancy is a *fundamental difficulty* in classical celestial mechanics (Newtonian physics). Classical physics predicts that accelerated expansion should be limited by gravity, not by a mysterious force like dark energy. 4. **Seeliger's Work:** The text references Seeliger’s work, which is crucial because
he first pointed out this problem and suggested it might be an indication of a deeper issue with the standard cosmological model. 5. **The Implications (as presented in the text):** The text suggests that if we truly understood dark energy, it would have profound implications for our understanding of the universe's origin, its ultimate fate, and potentially even physics beyond what we currently know. It represents a fundamental challenge to the standard cosmological model and could point to a
need for new physics. In short, the cosmological constant problem is a critical puzzle that forces us to re-evaluate our fundamental assumptions about the nature of space, time, gravity, and the universe itself.
