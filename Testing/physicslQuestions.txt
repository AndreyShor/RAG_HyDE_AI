ðŸŸ¢ Easy (Introductory Level)

1. Question: What is the primary force that keeps planets in orbit around the Sun?

Answer: Gravity. Newton's law of universal gravitation describes the attractive force between two masses.â€‹

2. Question: What does Einstein's equation  E =mc^2 signify?

Answer: It expresses the equivalence of mass and energy, indicating that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa.â€‹

3. Question: Why do we see a rainbow after rain?

Answer: Due to the dispersion of light; sunlight is refracted, reflected, and dispersed in water droplets, splitting into its constituent colors.â€‹

4. Question: How does the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle affect our understanding of particles?

Answer: It states that certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, cannot both be known to arbitrary precision simultaneously. This introduces fundamental limits to measurement at quantum scales.â€‹

5. Question: What is the significance of the double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics?

Answer: It demonstrates that particles like electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, leading to interference patterns that challenge classical intuitions.â€‹

6. Question: What does the term "entanglement" mean in quantum physics?

Answer: Entanglement refers to a phenomenon where particles become linked, and the state of one instantly influences the state of another, regardless of distance.â€‹

7. Question: What is the hierarchy problem in particle physics?

Answer: It concerns the question of why gravity is exponentially weaker than the other fundamental forces, and why the Higgs boson's mass is much lighter than expected from quantum corrections. â€‹

8. Question: How does the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking relate to the Higgs mechanism?

Answer: Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when a system that is symmetric under certain transformations ends up in an asymmetric state. In the Higgs mechanism, this explains how particles acquire mass.â€‹

9. Question: What challenges arise when attempting to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics?

Answer: The main challenge is that general relativity describes gravity on large scales as a smooth spacetime fabric, while quantum mechanics governs the probabilistic behavior of particles at microscopic scales. Combining these leads to mathematical inconsistencies.â€‹


ðŸ§  Super Hard (Research Level)

10. Question: What is the black hole information paradox?

Answer: It questions whether information that falls into a black hole is lost forever, challenging the principle that information is conserved in quantum mechanics. â€‹

11. Question: How does the concept of quantum gravity attempt to address the limitations of current physical theories?

Answer: Quantum gravity seeks to develop a framework that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics, aiming to describe gravity according to quantum principles.â€‹

12 Question: What is the significance of the cosmological constant problem?

Answer: It refers to the discrepancy between the observed value of dark energy density (cosmological constant) and theoretical predictions, which differ by many orders of magnitude, posing a major challenge in theoretical physics. â€‹
