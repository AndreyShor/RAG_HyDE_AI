Physics is the most fundamental and all-inclusive of the sci-
ences, and has had a profound effect on all scientiﬁc develop-
ment. In fact, physics is the present-day equivalent of what used to
be called natural philosophy, from which most of our modern sci-
ences arose. Students of many ﬁelds ﬁnd themselves studying
physics because of the basic role it plays in all phenomena. In this
chapter we shall try to explain what the fundamental problems in
the other sciences are, but of course it is impossible in so small a
space really to deal with the complex, subtle, beautiful matters in
these other ﬁelds. Lack of space also prevents our discussing the re-
lation of physics to engineering, industry, society, and war, or even
the most remarkable relationship between mathematics and
physics. (Mathematics is not a science from our point of view, in
the sense that it is not a natural science. The test of its validity is
not experiment.) We must, incidentally, make it clear from the be-
ginning that if a thing is not a science, it is not necessarily bad. For
example, love is not a science. So, if something is said not to be a
science, it does not mean that there is something wrong with it; it

Physics is the study of matter and energy – how they interact with each other and how the universe works. 
It’s a broad field that investigates fundamental principles governing everything around us, 
from the smallest particles to the largest structures in the cosmos.
